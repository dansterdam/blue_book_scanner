I.   SOURCE: Curtis Carley
        Address: Box 61, Greenville AFB, Miss.
        Age: 26
        Occupation: Officer, USAF; Accident Investigation Officer, 
                    Flying Safety; Pilot

        Education: Two years College, Business Administration; Squadron
                   Officers' school; Pilot training; Helicopter school.

        Qualifications: SOURCE has been on active duty for five years
                        and on flying status for five years. SOURCE
                        served in Korea June 1952 - Oct 1953, and has
                        a total of 100 combat missions in F-84 aircraft and 20 combat missions in F-86 aircraft.

II.  RELIABILITY: SOURCE appeared to be intelligent and was very cooperative.
     He answered all questions as completely as possible with no attempt to procrastinate. SOURCE indicated his observation of object was not complete as that
     of SOURCE, Part One; therefore the subsequent lack of detail. In consideration
     of SOURCE's military background and combat experience information may be considered
     reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 22 May at approximately 2305 CST while flying as pilot in the rear seat of a T-33 aircraft he noted
     a bright light on the horizon moving in a westerly direction. SOURCE was flying
     on a heading of 050° at 19,000 feet an indicated speed of 240 knots. Object
     was observed for approximately 15 minutes. Many stars were visible during the
     sighting and the moon appeared to be full. Object was brighter than the background
     of the sky and resembled automobile headlights one-half block away. Object appeared
     to stand still inside during the sighting and would also slowly speed up and rush
     away. Object did not break up into parts or explode. It did not give off smoke
     or exhaust trail. Object did not change brightness or shape, and did not flicker.
     Estimate or track. Object did not move in front of or behind anything. Object was
     observed with the naked eye through the aircraft canopy. No sound was noted from
     the object. SOURCE described object as having an extremely white intense light
     which seemed to come from an area that might have the cockpit of the object. The
     light was a pure white intensity as to give the appearance of being a solid glare.
     Object was sharply outlined and only one such object was noted in the sky. SOURCE
     estimated real size of object was 100 to 150 feet in its longest dimension. When
     first noted object appeared larger than the head of a pin held at arm's length and
     from approximately 200 yards it appeared the size of a half dollar at arm's length.
     Object was still visible when a decision was made to leave the area. SOURCE was
     made to contact the object or any air base by radio during sighting. It was
     not possible to make radar contact since the aircraft was not equipped for that
     type of operation. SOURCE stated that he was too construct the object of known
     materials it would be made of a metallic substance and of circular shape. Object
     would be "constructed with a greenhouse shaped dome top and with very large
     window in the front of the dome. Lights reflecting underneath the object gave it
     the appearance of having wings. SOURCE was flying over open country during time
     of sighting and was looking in a direction 090 to 120° when he first saw object.

(Cont'd)

He was looking towards approximately 300° when he last saw the object. Object on first sighting appeared to be 075° from true north a little above the horizon. SOURCE did not indicate the angular direction of the object when he last saw it. At time of sighting there was a light wind from 210° at 19,000 feet, the temperature was warm, and there were high, thin, scattered clouds. This was the first time SOURCE had noted this type of object and in his opinion it was some type of nonorbital aircraft. Object was probably moving faster than 300 knots. Closest approach to object was approximately 200 yards. SOURCE was particularly impressed by the apparent maneuverability of object. SOURCE unable to make a sketch or provide more extensive estimate of the size of object.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. In the opinion of the preparing officer the sighting as observed by SOURCE generally conforms to the characteristics of an optical phenomena by-photesis. A comparative inversion reported in the area of the sighting may have been a contributing factor to the occurrence of this sighting.

2. Supplementary investigative efforts and the descriptions of sighting provided by SOURCES generally eliminates the possibility that this sighting was caused by a balloon, astronomical phenomena, or any known type of aircraft.

LOUIS MONROE
Captain, USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. This headquarters does not concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was caused by an optical phenomenon. Inasmuch as the object appeared to become larger as the SOURCES approached it and then appeared to become smaller in size as the SOURCES withdrew from it, the existence of a solid object rather than a type of optical phenomenon is indicated.

2. It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was caused by the radiosonde balloon launched from the U.S. Weather Observatory at Shreveport, La., at 22/210COST May 1956. (See para 5a, Page 9). The following data is given in support of the above hypothesis:

a. 'The investigative unit placed a 500 gram radiosonde balloon in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting.

b. During the passage of a jet aircraft near a balloon, the air currents generated by the passing aircraft could with the jet exhaust would create the impression of deceptive and erratic movements on the part of the balloon. Striking at a floating child's balloon with an open hand would simulate this action.

c. As the aircraft passed beneath the object a bright light flashed in the observers' eyes. Note that the light on the radiosonde balloon is mounted on the end of the suspension train, beneath the balloon. (See attached diagrams). Even a small light would appear fractionally bright at close and just above the darkness of night flight.

d. The oscillation of the suspension train due to winds would cause the light on the end of the suspension train to appear in any position in relation to the balloon, other than above it.

e. At the time of the sighting there was a three-quarter moon in the southern sky which would have illuminated the white balloon, creating the dome effect.

f. The red light which was noted by one SOURCE could have been the white running light as seen through the red parachute attached to the suspension train. (See attached diagrams).

DESCRIPTION OF 500 GRAM RADIOSONDE WEATHER BALLOON

The following is a description of a 500 gram Radiosonde weather balloon released at Shreveport, La., at 2100 CST on date of sighting:

a. Size of balloon at 19,000 ft—approximately 14 ft high and 12 ft diameter. These figures are only estimates, since none knows exactly how much expansion has taken place at the given altitude. Size of balloon when released is 6 ft high and 5 ft diameter.

b. Color of balloon—white

c. Color of attached parachute—red

d. Position and size of all lights—one light only, suspended approximately 60-80 ft below balloon, at end of train. There is no compulsory length for train, so the one on this report was not measured. Light consisted of one regular sized flashlight bulb attached to battery 3 in by 2 in by 1 in. Life of battery normally 2 to four hours. Light was white.

e. Length of Train—approximately 60 to 80 ft (was not measured).

f. Method of attaching lights to train—light tied securely to train with cord.

g. Power supply for lights—one small battery—see d, above

h. Diagram of balloon—Ref Incl #1, attached

i. Diagram of power supply—Ref Incl #2, attached

It was pointed out by technicians who release weather balloons, that the train is not of sufficient weight to remain suspended directly the balloon in winds of relatively high velocity, (not over 5 pound), including parachute, transmitter and light). Therefore, the light might be, at times, in any position in relation to the balloon, other than above it.

Ft 2-D, 4602d AISS                 REPORT NO. 2D-UFOB-2-56         Part One        PAGE 2 of 15 PAGES

I.   SOURCE: Earl D. Holwadel

Address: Office of Resident Auditor, Greenville AFB, Miss.

Age: 25

Occupation: Officer, USAF, Auditor, Pilot

Education: B. S., Business Administration; Graduate, Pilot Training, 1954

Qualifications: SOURCE has been on active duty for approximately three years and on flying status for approximately three years.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appeared to be highly intelligent. He was completely sincere and answered all questions frankly. SOURCE indicated that, although subjected to the ridicule that often accompanies reports of this type, he felt it his duty to report the sighting as completely as possible. SOURCE's estimates of measurements may be considered fairly reliable as indicated by his estimates of the relative size of known objects.

Information may be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE indicated that on 22 May 1956 at approximately 2305 CST while flying in the front seat of a T33 aircraft 50 Knots northwest of Monroe, La. (source JNAC 5329), his attention was attracted to a bright object in the easterly portion of the sky. SOURCE's course at time of sighting was 050 at 16,000 feet. At 2315 the object was again apparently due east, and the decision was made to investigate, since the possibility of the object being a planet or star appeared doubtful. SOURCE stated he "peeled off" to the south and moved in trail of object, which at that time appeared to be in the southeast. (See sketch, Incl #1, path and movement of object). The object appeared to be a great distance away from the aircraft, suddenly it came straight at the observer at a rapid rate of speed. SOURCE stated they crossed the rear of the object, encountered no wash, and moved south of it. Object came away and then returned at high speed on a westerly course. SOURCE stated they cruised in front of the object and noticed odd and extremely bright lighting which did not resemble lighting of any known aircraft. Shape of the object could not be clearly determined and no wash was apparent on object's west side. SOURCE said maneuverability of object was fantastic and at no time did it change its positional attitude in relationship to object at a distance of approximately 75 yards and on a heading of 330° with the sun in intensely bright lighting in canopy of his aircraft. SOURCE stated object appeared to be squat, bulky and cross-shaped. It appeared to be shorter than a C47 and wider than a C47. There was no visible wing span. Longest dimension of the bulk of object appeared to be 30 to 40 feet. (Incl #2, sketch of object). SOURCE saw no clear outline or object other than the bulk of dome which was positioned at the center of the cross. It was from this dome that the bright white light appeared. In addition to the white light noted near the red light, resembling an aircraft running light on top of the dome. However, the brightest light emanated from the high windshield type observation glass in the front of the dome. SOURCE obtained a good view of underneath side of object from 75 yards distance. It seemed to him that the under surface of object was of steel construction, and had a rib-like appearance with the ribs extending to a 1 foot and creating a wave-like impression. (Incl #3, sketch of under side of object). During the 15 minutes duration of sighting SOURCE noted that there

were many stars in the sky and a three-quarters full moon. Object appeared brighter
than background of the sky and resembled the brightness of an automobile headlight
approximately one block away. Object appeared to stand still at times, speed up
and rush away, (twice), did not break into parts, give off smoke, change bright-
ness or shape. It did not appear to flicker, throb, or pulsate. Object did not
move behind anything or in front of anything during period of sighting. Object
appeared to be solid and was view with the naked eye through the canopy of the
aircraft. Object emitted no perceivable sound and the edges appeared to be fuzzy
or blurred. Only one object was noted. At the closest point of observation
SOURCE was certain object appeared to be as large as the size of a grapefruit
held at arm's length, and at farthest point of observation resembled the size
of a pinhead at arm's length. Object was still apparent in the sky when a decision
was made to leave the area. SOURCE stated that if he could construct the object
from known material, it would be of steel construction, bulky cross-shaped, approx-
imately 40 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet thick at the center point. SOURCE
unable to indicate a resemblance of object to any known configuration or common
object. SOURCE was looking approximately east when he first saw the object and
approximately west when he last saw the object. SOURCE estimated object was 900
feet from north and 100 above horizon when he first saw it, and 2250 feet from
north and 25° above horizon when he left the area. There were thin, and very
scattered clouds during the sighting. The weather was dry and cool. A 20 knot
wind at 260° was indicated. SOURCE stated this was the first time he had seen
this type of object, and could not give an opinion as to what it might be. Speed
of object ranged from hovering to velocities in excess of the 300-400 knots his
aircraft was flying at the time. Closest and farthest points of observation
were 75 yards and 60 miles approximately. SOURCE was quite disturbed by the occur-
ence and did not attempt radio contact with any air base or with the object during
the period of sighting. SOURCE was extremely impressed by the maneuverability of
the object.
