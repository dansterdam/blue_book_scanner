INSUFFICIENT DATA

Following is an extract of the SIO report submitted by Capt Henry for the period 11-12 March 58:

2130: Two calls from WPAFB SIO Major Huke re flying objects (m. of USAF, Columbus) sighted flying object over Springfield (he will be at Springfield overnight). Second sighting was also Springfield.

Mr. of Springfield Sun (newspaper). As neither gentleman called ATIC SIO, believed questions to be asked best be left to ATIC phone numbers or immediate locations were given in either case. Sparse information presented by Major Huke indicates both reporters probably saw conventional aircraft plus steady and rotating lights appearing under overcast conditions.

b. 1500 attempt to interview
   then telephoned
   with his SIO instructions?
c. Insufficient data (as we have here
   in that two gentlemen...)
