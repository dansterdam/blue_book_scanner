The following account of the sighting of an unidentified flying object is submitted:

1. The object, sighted in the vicinity of Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, appeared round and about the size of a pencil head. The single object changed colors from white to amber to bright red. There was no trail and no sound coming from the object. Then not traveling, in a straight line 15 appeared to be suspended in the air. During the sighting the object made no unusual maneuvers. It disappeared gradually.

2. Object was sighted at approximately 2310 hours (local time) 30 July 1952 and remained in view ten (10) or twenty (20) minutes.

3. Three of the four observers used field glasses (power: 7 x 50) to accomplish the sighting. The fourth observer viewed the object with naked eye.

4. The observers were located in the Maxwell Control Tower (32°23'N 86°22'W), facing west. The object was estimated to be 20 to 25 miles from the observers, traveling SE to NW at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.

5. The original observer, chief of the tower crew, claims 13 months experience as a tower operator. Two other observers were members of the tower crew, with two months experience as operators. The fourth observer was MCOIC of AACS Facilities at Maxwell. All of them claim no previous sighting of unidentified flying objects.

6. At time of sighting winds at 30,000 feet were 70° at 12 knots, clouds were scattered at 25,000 feet, visibility was 15 miles plus, temperature was 81°, and surface winds were SSW at 7 knots.

7. There was no activity or condition in the area which might be responsible for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the sighting was obtained.

9. Interrogation or identification action was not taken because of the unavailability of necessary resources.

10. At one time during the sighting there was a C-47 aircraft over Maxwell. At 10 W at 1,000 feet. An attempt was made to contact the pilot but the camp proved unsuccessful.

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Object

1. Observation was made by the undersigned at approximately 2310 hours on 30 July 1952, from the west side of Maxwell, Texas, seventy-five (75) feet above ground level.

2. Object was seen west of Maxwell Field and appeared to be at a distance of more than twenty-five (25) miles and at an altitude of more than twenty (20) thousand feet.

3. Close observation through the use of binoculars revealed that this phenomenon was a revolving spherical mass similar to, but larger than, a star whose color appeared a light blue to amber and rode. There was no sound coming from that direction and no trails were observed. The object, definitely not a conventional type of aircraft, had a slight moving action similar to the one of a pendulum. Its motion covered an angle of approximately fifteen (15) degrees. It was still in the same location at 2345 hours, the time at which I left my post.

4. The above facts are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

1. At about 2310 hours, 30 July 1952, at Maxwell Control Tower I observed an object about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) miles west of Maxwell. This object was about thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) thousand feet in altitude and traveled from SE to NW. The object seemed to change colors from white to a bright red. It was in sight for approximately ten (10) minutes.

2. I will not eliminate the possibility of this object being some form of astrology. However, in my opinion it was not.

It looked somewhat like a falling star except the movement was more serpentine.
The color spread to change from dim to red to bright white.
The object was moving with apparent high speed. As the object moved to
move ahead in a very erratic manner. The three observers (with glasses),
during those periods were able to determine that the object was not

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Country: USA
Date of Report: 1 August 1952
Date of Information: 30-31 July 1952
Area: Southeast Mississippi
From: Wing Intelligence Office, Keesler AFB, Mississippi

Prepared by: Major Wm. S. Fodor, Jr.
Headquarters: AFOIL-C/OC-2, Hq USAF, dtd 19 Dec 1951, United Flying Saucer Quadrant

Subject: Reporting of Information on Unidentified Flying Object

1. At approximately 2355 hours CST, 30 July 1952, Captain Eugene P. Despie and Technical Sergeant James R. Hanson sighted an unusual object on the PPI scope of an AN/CPS-5 radar at Keesler AFB, Miss.

2. The target, which appeared on the PPI scope in a teardrop shape, was first sighted at an azimuth of 315P approximately forty-three (43) miles distant. The size of the target was estimated to be approximately that of a C-54 aircraft.

3. During the period of observation, the target was seen to travel in a general southerly direction for a distance of one (1) mile; a maneuver which involved two (2) minutes. It remained in a near stationary position for four (4) minutes. The object then began a very slow movement north for an approximate period of three (3) minutes where it again assumed a stationary position for two (2) minutes. Completely, the target was observed for approximately three (3) minutes and began a more rapid movement in a northerly direction for approximately fifty (50) miles (from the CSE-5 end) at which point it disappeared from the PPI scope. The estimated speed varied from zero (0) to approximately five (5) to fifty (50) miles per hour.

4. The unusual maneuvers and the slow speed of the sighted object, in addition to a prevailing temperature inversion, has led the observer to advance the opinion that the target was a non-flying object. Acting upon this assumption, a Special Agent for the Military Personnel Civilian.

STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, authorized to administer oaths in cases of this nature, Captain [redacted], 3398th Technical Training Squadron, 3380th Technical Training Group, Kessler Air Force Base, Mississippi, and upon being warned of his rights under the 31st Article, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and upon being duly sworn according to law, made the following voluntary sworn statement:

"At approximately 2355 hours CST, 30 July 1952, Technical Sergeant [redacted] and the undersigned located an unusual blip (target) on the PPI scope of the USAF radar set, located at Kessler Air Force Base.

"The target was first sighted at an azimuth of 335°, approximately forty-three (43) miles from the site of the radar sets. The target moved very slowly south for approximately two (2) minutes, moving only a mile or so; it then stopped for a period of four (4) minutes; it then began a very slow movement north for three (3) minutes, stopped for two (2) minutes and disappeared. Approximately three (3) minutes later, it re-appeared and began moving at a more rapid pace north and at fifty (50) miles from our site, the track disappeared completely. The estimated speed of the target was forty (40) to forty-five (45) miles per hour.

"During the observation at 2400 hours CST, the undersigned requested the two tower operators to scan the azimuth of 3300 to 3400 with binoculars to ascertain if they could sight any object or lights, moving or stationary. Only one star was sighted.

"A query was made by the undersigned to the Base Weather Forecaster whose records indicated that a temperature inversion was existent over the area in which the target (blip) was sighted. Further study of the position of the track on WAC 467 revealed a railroad track and highway in line with the position of the target.

"In view of the above findings, it is the opinion of the undersigned that the object sighted (on the radar scope only) was some ground vehicle and the unusual pick up was caused by the prevailing atmospheric conditions.

"It is recommended that the Illinois Central Railroad be contacted to ascertain if any trains operated in the vicinity of Wiggins and

Mr. [redacted]:
Oh, no, that's all right. I might be able to get this very shortly for you. I will try to.

Col Wood:
Col Wood speaking.

Mr. [redacted]:
Colonel, the trainmaster says that northbound train went through Wichita about 10:30 P.M. last night. That would put it through Emporia about 11:00 o'clock and it arrives in Kittlesberg about 11:45 P.M.

Col Wood:
Kittlesburg at 11:45. In that the usual time line?

Mr. [redacted]:
Yes, that's the actual time. Now, there was an outbound train out of Kittlesburg about 11:15 in the morning.

Col Wood:
That wouldn't fit then. A little incident happened up in that area that we are trying to figure out whether it was on the right of way or through an act. It doesn't affect your actual train operation, though it does affect certain military aspects.

Mr. [redacted]:
Well, if you want this figure any closer, any other way we can help you, just let me know and I will get after them. I called up there and that's what they gave me. I talked to the trainmaster's office. But they said in Kittlesburg, they give, and they figured it would be about 10:30 through Brooklyn, 11:00 through Brooklyn.

Fine. Thank you very much.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

Referring further to your various questions by number:

#3. Because we can no longer see the trail movement from the west window in home where we first saw it, my little girl and I walked hurriedly out of the house (which faces to the north) and watched on the front lawn until above trees and in distance in the southeast it was lost to our sight.

Above also would have reference to Section 8, #7, 8, 8-1.

#10. Trail was first seen through window glass and afterward through open space.

#13. "Did the object look Solid?" It did look solid slightly thinner at bottom, or the beginning, where there could be seen a very tiny bit of blue between the white, at which point I also termed the "twisty" movement of the white was noticed, as per question #25, also.

That impressed me was the white trail was straight edges of the white trail both as it came down from sky and disappeared into or behind cloud and also as it reappeared when the narrow appearing line, somewhat like a point, was about 30 yrs. an airplane make smoke-writing for advertisements but by contrast this differed in that advertisement writing would be more distinct at the edges.

The white trail movement as referred to throughout this questionnaire seemed all the time confined to an even width and only faded out at the starting point.

25. Drew a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A hand-drawn sketch shows a white trail coming straight down from sky with slightly "twisty" movement of fleecy white at bottom, appearing with distinct edges and appeared about 4 inches wide, in West.

White trail out cloud with movement heading Southeast, more East than South.]

SECTION E

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this?
(Circle One): Yes   No

26.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? I first wondered if something was coming down and would explode. When movement changed and trail beginning movement took off toward Southeast, wondered if Air Base was having some kind of probe or test, - or if I could be that an enemy was experimenting from high above with a guided missile, or experimenting with something not dangerous to see what could be directed to a given spot successfully or an event an enemy desired to effect sabotage or war.

28. Give the following information about yourself:

[Personal details are redacted/blacked out, but visible details include:]
Telephone Number: 3-5291
Present Job: Housewife
Age: 48
Sex: Female
Last School Attended: Northwest Business College, St. Paul
Year of last attendance at this school: 1920


- page 63 -

Reference
SECTION 6, Your P.5.1. file. The movement appeared to go down into
or behind a large cloud. Beneath it and I wondered if it would appear
again in the blue sky beneath it as we watched but instead it came
out leaving a much narrower appearing trail out from the south east
end of the cloud.

#20. I Though the trail was many feet above the earth, yet I am not
able to judge how many hundreds of feet high.

I felt hesitant to report the movement for possibly our
Government authorities might be fully aware of this and I would not
want to hinder or trouble with a trifle and yet I reasoned that if
they knew all about it there should not be any harm done in reporting
and so I immediately phoned lest no one in authority could have seen
it from where they were said, to therefore, might be willing to follow it
to determine if it were something that was, or was not, according their
regulations.

At 3:19 pm on Wednesday, July 30, 1952, I was sitting at a table by a picture window and my little five year old daughter called my attention to something in the sky at about a 50° angle toward the southwest which appeared to be a curved distinctly down from the clear, blue sky above. The sky nearest behind him was a thin wispy white, thick, like fleecy wide clouds, and not over four inches wide. Then, going straight down, disappeared into a large white cloud, sort of grayish, toward the east.

We watched to see if something would come thru the cloud but it did not appear in the blue sky beneath the cloud but instead, after a short time, about two minutes, we saw the movement with a sort of "twisty" appearance going horizontally instead of straight down. Let's only the appearance of thick, fleecy solid white, the width to the eye now only about like a clothes line behind and going into the blue sky toward south a little but much more toward the east. We went outside in front of our house which is south facing on Rose Markate Street.

Then, because of trees across the street, it was lost to sight toward the southeast at an angle of about 35° at 3:26.

The white trail did not seem to widen as it disappeared but rather faded out slowly from top part of view and the trail moved southeastward.

SUBJECT: FLYOBJET

In accordance with AFL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects (Shortfile), the following report of unidentified flying objects is submitted:

On 30 July 1952 at approximately 2175 MST, Jack V. Keely reported a strange, bright, white object traveling from east to west at different speeds. The object appeared to be circular in shape, and it had the color and appearance of a white cloud. The object was observed for about 30 seconds.

(Circle One): Yes or No

29.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:
I am unable to list their names as they lived across the street & I had never seen them before. Besides at the time there were 3-4 children present.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believes are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

I feel rather silly turning in this questionnaire, but I have talked to the G-2 & the Liaison Officer of the F.B.I. depts. both advised me to make an "Official Report" outside of this. I am unable, no excuse but I saw a "flying saucer", but I did see an object which I was unable to identify.

My delay in answering was caused by my attendance at school at Ft. Leavenworth from August-December.

The facts are as I state them and in my SUBJECT-TO letter of August I which I promise you here a copy.

       ATTN: AC0f3, G-2

The undersigned lives at 681D, Infantry Post, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. At 2230 hours, 31 July 1952, he heard his neighbors make the following remarks: "There is a 1st Lieutenant who comes one," etc. Lieutenant went outside to investigate the possibility of seeing a "flying saucer". At approximately 2235, facing southwest, he saw an object moving across the sky at a speed less than that of a conventional aircraft. It had no blinking lights on its wings and no flaming exhaust. It had some type of motor, as a hum was heard which seemed to be a hundred yards behind the object. Its color was red in distinction to the stars, which were yellow. The size seemed to be that of a star and the shape appeared to be round. It did not seem to be burning, yet the entire object cast a reddish glow. It appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 3,000 and 6,000 feet. It disappeared after being visible for a period of about one minute.

Presque Isle AFB, Maine

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

At 1507 EWT, 30 July 1952, Noulton, Maine Radio notified Presque Isle Tower
of all from Maine State Police of reported sighting of unidentified
flying object over Monticello, Maine (46°18'N - 67°50' W). The OSI at this station
was advised of this report and every effort has been made to contact the individuals
reporting this sighting. This has proved to be unsuccessful.

Civilian report contains:
Shape - unknown
Size - approximately 200 feet wide
Manner of Observation - no report
Speed - unknown
Length of time observed - unknown
Altitude - reported object as being just above clouds. Base Weather
Station reported clouds at time of reported sighting to be
5000 feet.

Air traffic in the general area at the time of sighting was one Canadian
helicopter within and departed this station at 1357 EWT and landed at 1455 EWT.
Pilot reports having been in the vicinity of Noulton (47°07' N - 67°51' W)
approximately 13 miles (nautical air miles) south of Monticello.

Taking into account the reported route taken by the Canadian helicopter
following take-off from this base, it is not unreasonable to assume that the
reported sighting may have been that of this helicopter. The evaluation placed
upon this reported sighting is B-6.

At 1515 EWT, 30 July an F-86 aircraft from 75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron
was vectored to investigate a "meteorological object" in the vicinity of Presque
Isle Air Force Base. The pilot reports having sighted object approximately 20 to
25 east of this base at 15,000 feet for approximately 15 minutes. Object appeared
as a white speck and pilot stated it was a weather balloon approximately 6 feet
in diameter, white and tear-drop shaped. This balloon was observed from 2,000
feet below object.

At 1245 EWT a second F-86 aircraft observed an object 80 to 90 east of this
base at 37,000. Pilot description identical with first pilot report. Pilot also
identified as weather balloon. Pilot stated he could not get closer than approxi-
mately 3 miles to object at 40,000 feet.

Local weather at the time of sighting as received from the Base Weather Office
was as follows:
5000 feet scattered, 20 miles visibility, temperature 74°, dew point 50,
Wind SW 9 knots.
Wind aloft:
5000 - 250° 17 K
10,000 - 250° 18 K
15,000 - 250° 25 K
20,000 - 240° 37 K

At 1115 hours 30 July 1952, an unidentified object was observed ten miles east of Ocala, Florida, by Highway 5A at time or altitude.

The object appeared to be a disc, bright white in color, similar to white cement, with no definite outline, and was flying straight and level, except for slight rocking or angular motion. The object was flying from north to south, approximately parallel to, and a undetermined distance west of U. S. Highway 92.

The object was observed approximately 30 seconds, traveling at a very high rate of speed. Therefore no photographic evidence, exhaust or vapor trail visible, and no estimate of speed could be made. The observer could not cite an estimate of altitude, but object was higher than tops of the highest clouds, which were estimated at 1900 feet.

Gross studies of object was clear shaped.

Observer lives the miles from Haslett Air Force Base, and stated that, based on previous observations of JG type aircraft, he does not believe object was an aircraft.

Weather at time of sighting was CAVU with scattered cumulus clouds.

No information was made and no photographs were taken.

Aircraft operating in this area during period of observation, Brasher, Haslett Air Force Base, Pinecastle Air Force Base, or Sanford Naval Air Station were reported in this area at time of observation.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

AREA LOCATED ON Albuquerque, New Mexico                REPORT NO. N/A

DATE OF REPORT 6 August 1952                           DATE OF INFORMATION 5 August 1952

PREPARED BY Katherine P. Lewis, 1st Lt.                SOURCE Visual and Electronic

SUBJECT: FLYOBRPT

In accordance with ATL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBRPT), the following report of unidentified flying objects is submitted:

On 29 July 1952 at 2202 MST, 1st Lt. George E. Funk, Duty Controller, 139th ACGM Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, N.M., observed a strange light in the western sky. In company with several other men, he watched the light for approximately three minutes through a transit as well as with the naked eye. The light hovered in the sky for about ten (10) minutes and gradually seemed to fade away.

At approximately 0015 MST 30 July 1952, the 769th ACGM Squadron, Continental Divide, New Mexico was notified by Lt. Funk that an electronic contact with the object and several people went outside of the building to look for it. The object was seen hovering under a cloud to the east. It moved nearly vertically at times. For a few minutes, and then at a speed of approximately 200-300 miles per hour, it moved towards the north. The time of observation by observers at the 769th ACGM Squadron was approximately ten (10) minutes.

An attempt was made by the 756th Interceptor Squadron (ADC) from Kirtland AFB to intercept the object; however, no sighting was made by the fighter.

The reliability of the observers making the above sightings is considered good.

1. An unidentified flying object was observed near Sunland, California, 30 July 1952. The sighting occurred at 1825PST.

2. The witnesses were seated on a porch in Sunland, California, watching planes arriving at Burbank, California, when they saw an intense white-blue light in a cloud to the north northwest. The light burned for about seven seconds. Both witnesses then saw a sensor shaped object approaching somewhat the same southerly heading with a speed which appeared faster than that of a commercial DC-6 still in the vicinity of the airport. The object had a wobbly sort of motion and a saucer like shape. In turned to the north. Following the path of approaching aircraft and disappeared beyond the hills. The witness is a Douglas engineer and states the object appeared at least as large if not larger than a DC-6.

3. Weather in the area at the time of sighting was clear with 10 miles visibility. Winds aloft at 5,000 feet from 130° at 5 knots; 10,000 feet from 200° at 7 knots; 16,000 feet from 180° at 9 knots; 20,000 feet from 150° at 15 knots.

4. Witnesses [redacted] and an unidentified woman, Los Angeles, California, telephone [redacted].

5. There were numerous planes flying in the vicinity of Burbank at the time of sighting. However, because there was no log of their landings and take-offs, therefore, an accurate check of air traffic could not be obtained.

Comments of Preparing Officer:
1. Present employment of the witness indicates adequate aerial observer qualifications. Witness was not interviewed.
