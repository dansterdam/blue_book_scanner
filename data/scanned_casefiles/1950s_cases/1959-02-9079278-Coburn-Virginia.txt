The image appears to be a newspaper clipping with the headline "Strange Lights Seen In Wise". At the top left, there's a smaller text that reads "Are They New Type of Aircraft?". The rest of the document is a dense block of text that is difficult to read clearly due to the low image quality. The page has three hole punches on the right side, suggesting it is part of a file or report. The text is in black and white and appears to be from a newspaper or official document from the late 1950s.

The first few lines I can partially make out include "By ALEX CROCKETT" and some text about a location, but the majority of the text is too blurry to transcribe accurately.

On the night of April 17, 1959 several members of the Cumberland Astronomical Society went to Coburn to watch for the objects which the City was watching. We were at a vantage point that some time when a strange light was seen. I was thinking that light appeared in county 3. Figures were "busy" and we watched. We could see a lady seated to the left lights which was apparently a large bright light. This light took almost 1/2 minute to figure from the position sighted to almost 1/2 mile high. Unbelievable height. The distance to the until 130 am with seeing that time. I stayed some time, all inquiring along in same path as the opposite direction. On this day or day before the same as pictured. The blinking lights that appear similar to the moving lights were blurry to show was no available some time. I know there was a lot happening down yet located yet unreal.

Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

1. Made from some light, polished metal in a circular shape, about as wide as long, put in diameter with as done on the top that looked at a steady rate with a red light.

2. The only thing I could think of as to a similar object placed in the sky would be an airplane at such a distance as to give no sound and all lights to be off, yet some large red blinking light. This would surprise the naked eye, but when looked at through binoculars, you would be able to see the low sitting of a plane, so I can not think of anything which will resemble the UFO that I saw.

DATE June 9, 1959

On the night of April 17, 1959 several members of the Cumberland Astronomical Society and I went to the location at the Oakwood Cemetery, Culpeper, Va. at the base of Fleetwood Hill. About 8:30 p.m. the first object was seen. Herd blinking light and a dusky orange orb that could be seen each time the red light blinked off and disappeared as the red light shined on again. The weather conditions were as follows: Scattered clouds, few stars, hazy, slightly moist humidity, fairly cold, therminis presumably in view roughly one minute. There was definitely no sound or vapor trails. Another object was seen about 8:50 p.m. with some description. In all these three were 9 objects this night. I saw 6 of them. The most seen at any one time was 2. For that time that such object was seen, see [partially redacted]

I have seen said objects 9 times in all different
nights and I know that something is out there
moving with a solid form to it. I know it can't
be an illusion because I have seen it in any worthless
imaginable object held or seen. There is a negative
of a location in which one of these objects was
seen to take offense. It shows holes burned in the
area ground down and 3 holes which the members
put down clearly. They are arranged in a triangular
fashion. be                 pos. of the Astronomy clubs or
do not think it is a craft from another planet,
although there is the possibility, but more or less
a secret craft of the armed forces being tested in these
mountain regions. For example, the service built by
AILS limited of Canada for the air force, which is due
to be released this summer.

Probably within 11:30 or 11:30 PM. These were now seen that about 11:20 PM. The objects were some moving in northwest - southwest direction. I didn't want to look with the unaided eye so it was about till rays of a piece and only such. Though half glass of view was about the size of a dime and had a bright yellow light fading into the blurring red light. The objects followed

Flying Saucer Seen In Area

COBURN, Va. April 4 - Weird, pulsating lights in the sky, accompanied by strange noises, were reported here last night by several persons who stayed up all night watching the mysterious objects.

These flying saucers are back! Miller said he was keeping watch for these when here last night. Several people have described the objects in the sky and others have taken take of them.

David Miller said this was the first time he had seen the lights, but he believes "flying saucers" have a landing near here.

Miller said he has been so close to the objects he could almost touch them. He was watching their strong wind blowing through high trees near his home. He reported that he had to get close to one of them when they took off quickly.

Miller said the only one who has checked the flying saucers around this area, besides himself, was a student at Clinch Valley College at Wise, Va. He said some pictures of the objects were taken.

The rest of the text is partially illegible due to image quality, but appears to continue discussing the flying saucer sighting, weather conditions, and other details about the incident.

April 20, 1959, time 9:15 P.M. was located at bottom of Staunton Mt. in Cortland, Va. Object (adult given what was rotating) appeared with close the horizon with the West and was heading North, moving at a slow rate of speed. Was visible for about ten minutes. As I observed it through binoculars the slow slight of completely off, it was not seen same to a dim glow then thought come back but to a bright speed.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

One of the first questions which comes to mind is, how did the local Astronomy Club become interested in investigating the unidentified flying objects in Coburn Mr. when did you first become interested in these phenomena?

In this particular case, I have been interested for about three months. That is when we first heard about it and started going to Coburn at night to gather data.

Had you heard anything about the existence of these objects before three months ago?

No, I hadn't.

Mr. when did you become interested?

After we organized the Astronomy Club, some of the members brought reports of sightings of strange objects to the Club. That was about three months ago as far as Mr. has said.

Would you care to say more about the Astronomy Club?

Yes, the Cumberland Astronomical Society is a currently organization open to anyone in this area interested in astronomy. Several members have their own telescopes, which the society has been using. We are now starting work on two telescopes. One is a six-inch and the other a four-inch. We plan to have these both completed sometime this summer.

How long has this astronomical society been formed?

It was formed during the second semester about four months ago.

Did you become interested in this, Mr. at the same time these other gentlemen did?

The people of Coburn had made several sightings of these objects, and I talked to one of them, Mr. about it at about the same time the others became interested. He had seen some strange lights around Sheppard's Mountain, and was very curious about it, as we thought at first, interesting.

I notice in the papers that certain people who live in the vicinity of Coburn claim that they have been seeing these things for the past 10 years. Had you heard anything about it prior to this year?

No, I hadn't heard anything about it until I talked to Mr. He told me about it. As you said, there are people in Coburn who have been seeing unidentified objects off and on for the past 10 years.

Who, among this group, saw anything unusual, something which they were unable to explain?

I guess I was the first. It was on February 11th.

Would you mind telling us exactly what you saw?

There were three of us who went up to the mountain. One of these saw an object come into Shepprock Mountain and land. He called me and wanted me to go up with it.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

him, so I got another partner, and the three of us went to the base of the
mountain. When we got there, we saw an orangish glow coming up from the
mountain. We kept watching for sometime, but it was getting cold, so we
decided to go back to the car and sit where we could watch. We continued
stayed there for quite a while to about a few minutes to eleven. I now
this orangish glow coming up off the mountain. I pressed the others but
told them to watch. We couldn't tell if there was a definite object or
anything like that, but we did see something coming out of it. It looked
like it was the exhaust. The object rose from the ground, and from there
went up to the top of the mountain. It took 11 about 12 minutes. We
sat there and talked about it for a few minutes and were getting ready
to leave when one of the people with us looked up and saw it coming back.
We came back a light farther down the mountain and landed. In the same
spot. We stayed there for a few minutes and then left.

In other words, you saw this object, this light, leave the top of the
mountain.

Yes.

And then it came back and landed again?

Yes, it came back and hovered over the same spot and then landed again.

About how far from this object were you?

We weren't over twelve hundred feet from it.

I am especially interested in the size of the object. Would you say that it
was large enough to contain a man, for example?

We could hardly tell against the sky whether it was a large object or not.
The only thing we could see was the light, and the exhaust, or whatever it
was coming from it. It was a dark night, and all we could see was the light.

I believe that the Astronomy Society did receive a letter indirectly from a
lady who was to live in this area in which she pointed out the fact that there
was a child, she was from near Pulaski, and her father-in-law said that there
was a spoke event. Have you all investigated that possibility?

You did, we did. Our reason we do not feel that the spoke events are the
answer is the objects remained more into the wind. If they were reflections
from the clouds, it would have gone the wind instead of into it.

Why would they move down the wind?

Because the clouds would be moving, and the reflection can only be possible
due to the clouds have. I would have to follow the direction of the clouds.
Also the objects were not sighted in the direction of the spoke events. If
the lights were from the spoke events, then we know where they have been
observed would vary from the spoke events with such conditions. In other words,
full records of all the sightings we have made, such as altitude, direction,
how many objects, the approximate speed, and the weather conditions. The
records show the object have been seen under all kinds of weather conditions.
This seems to eliminate the spoke events as the cause.

I remember reading in the papers that nine objects were seen in one night.

Did any of you see these?

Yes, we saw them from the Coburn football field. Through field glasses they looked like an a red light which would fade to a yellowish light then back to red.

Do you think they could have been airplanes that you saw that night?

Well, they could have been airplanes, because during the past couple of weeks, we have been seeing airplanes there, going in the same direction as the unidentified objects being seen.

We have a plan which then we carry then out soon, we hope will answer the question if some of the objects that have been reported were airplanes or not.

What have you seen since your first sighting, Mr.

That was all I saw. By the way, you expressed your interest in the size of the objects earlier ago. It would be my estimate that I saw the lights from about a mile or two away. I would say that it was about the same size as an automobile or a little larger.

With this automobile, a Volks Wagon or a Cadillac

About the size of a station wagon. (SIZE OF QUARTER) AT ARM'S LENGTH)

Are there any additions to what has been brought out thus far that you all might have seen which you were unable to explain?

The phenomena about which many people are excited in Coburn is a light, really an orange light, which radiates out from the top of the mountain. On several occasions we have seen it. It is an orange light which radiated out from the top of the mountain against the light.

Have you gone up to check that?

Yes we were and we found on the mountain what seemed to be a tripod and marks of

Yes, we have and we found on the mountain what seemed to be stripped marks or something similar to that. They were placed from six to eight feet apart, and they were from an inch to three or four inches deep. Recently I have been back on the mountain and found two areas similar to this one. They are approximately thirty feet in diameter where the marks on the earth have been broken down, but we haven't found any evidence of burned places or anything like that.

That would fit right in with Mr. [redacted]'s estimate of the object being about the size of a station wagon, wouldn't it?

Yes, it would.

Do there anything else? I understand that you also found some daffodil, and you feel that that might have been an effort to test radar systems in various areas, with these strips of daffodil floated in. Do you believe that there is any connection between this and the unidentified objects?

Yes, there could be some connection between this, since it was found on the mountain near the spot where the object has been seen. The material I'll know could say my difference?

Yes, it would. The aluminum foil has been used before to fool up radar. I imagine the reason why they have used aluminum is because it is lighter than tinfoil and would float in the air longer.

When was the last sighting of these objects?

The last sightings have been made by the people of Coburn. We don't know whether they were true sightings or not. There is so much going on down there right now, also all the news has been in the papers, that we don't know what to know from.

Have you all actually been following this up since all this newspaper publicity?

Yes, we have.

Do they seem to be as frequent as they have been?

Not since all the publicity. There haven't been as many sightings. In fact, we haven't had any sightings of unknown objects since all this.

So far, we have just been discussing what we have seen, and I was wondering if along with those things which you saw, was there any news; that I noticed possibly a continuation. No, sir. I didn't hear a thing.

Anybody else? So come at all, huh? Well, we might ask about any future objects, any plans that you might have for investigating this thing further.

We plan to continue this until we leave. We will be leaving after this year to go to another college. We plan to continue NBIT until then and probably the new members of the club will continue too.

Do you plan to try to secure any additional equipment such as telescopes or range finders or Geiger counters or anything that might be useful?

Case Missing

China - Mar-April 1959

The possible varieties of angel hair increase with the development of new technologies. During March and April 1959, the Air Force received many reports that flying saucers were cruising over the mountains near Coburn, Virginia, regularly used a landing strip on an inaccessible peak of Sheep Rock Mountain, and frequently dropped angel hair on the nearby countryside. The investigating officer collected some of the material and identified it as a type of "window," the rolls or long strips of aluminum foil used by the military in World War II to produce spurious radar echoes and confuse enemy anti-aircraft fire. The Coburn angel hair was identified with the foil used by Air Force planes carrying out experiments in the area. "Window" falls very slowly; dropped from a height of 40,000 feet, it may easily be visible for some time to ground observers, as well as interfere with local radar reception [10].

DRAFT                                                        30 November 1959

1. Background.

a. On Wednesday, 27 May 1959, Major Tacker of SAFIS-3 called AFOIN-4Bg and informed Major Friend that Congressman Jennings had contacted SAFIS and requested information concerning an UFO sighting in Wise-Coeburn, Virginia area. A check was made of the UFO files and it was found that no reports had been received from Wise-Coeburn area. Hqs. 1006th AISS was contacted and was requested to investigate these sightings. The only available information was that received via telephone and newspaper articles received from Major Tacker. The information in the newspaper articles indicated a large number of residents in the Wise-Coeburn, Va. area sighted several strange lights and found strips of aluminum foil on the mountains in the area. (See Incl)

b. Detachment 8, 1006th AISS was directed to investigate the subject UFO sightings and contacted AFOIN-4Bg. Due to the fact the detachment was short of personnel, T/Sgt Bollieu of AFOIN-4Bg was directed to assist in the investigation. Friday, 5 June 1959, T/Sgt Bollieu and A/1c Brimacombe of Det 8, 1006th AISS departed Wright-Patterson AFB for Wise-Coeburn, Va. area and arrived at Wise, Va. at 2400 on same day.

2. Investigative Efforts.

a. 6 June 1959.

(1) Made an appointment with the Wise County Sheriff for 1315.

The county sheriff, Mrs. [redacted], who is also a waitress, had very little information concerning the sightings as she had not seen the objects herself. She stated that she had never heard of a mountain until reports of subject sightings reached her.


- page 113 -

(2) Departed Wise, Va. for Coburn, Va. Contacted Mr. [redacted] concerning the objects he had observed.

(see Tab C) Mr. [redacted] and his family had been seeing strange lights in the area for a number of years. They drive around almost every night looking for them.

(3) Contacted Mr. [redacted] of Coburn, a forest ranger (see Tab J). Mr. [redacted] has observed the objects for about a year, hearing noises like a strong wind blowing through power lines.

b. Sunday, 7 June 1959.

(1) Departed Coburn for Norton, Va. to look around the area.

This area of Virginia has only coal mining industries and there was found to be a large number of coke furnaces burning at all times. They are outdoor furnaces and an orange flame is emitted straight up through the top of the furnaces. They are located west of Coburn.

(2) Returned to Coburn and contacted Mr and Mrs [redacted]

They couldn't remember the date of their sighting, but the sighting itself was still vivid in their minds (see Tab G). Their description of the three lights they saw was identical to the railroad right-of-way lights used in this area, except the strange lights were seen through the tops of some trees approximately 10° elevation from eye level. The trees were approximately fifty yards from observer.

c. Monday, 8 June 1959.

(1) Visited the Clinch Valley College located near Wise, Va.

However, we could not talk to the individuals concerned with the UFO sightings as they were having an open house party for parents and relatives.

- page 114 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(2) Mr. guided the investigators up Sheeprock Mountain to the alleged clearing supposedly made by one of the UFO's. The clearing was reported to have been used during the month of March 1959. By the time the investigators saw it, it had grown up with weeds and the trees had filled out. During the early days of the sighting, it was reported, a large group of people were all over the mountain and had camped in the clearing with camp fires burning. The original reports stated limbs in the outer fringes of the clearing were broken and some brush in the center singed. By the time the local residents got through tramping all over the clearing and probably breaking trees for firewood, it was impossible to tell if the reports were accurate. As of now, the clearing looks like any clearing found in a forest. The three holes found there have also been filled in.

(3) Visited the family at their home. There are two young girls in the family and all members of the family claimed to have seen strange lights almost every night. We got Mrs. description of one seen by them on the night of 5 April 1959 (see TAB C). Later in the evening the investigators drove out on the road toward St. Paul, Va. with the family hoping to see some of the lights they claimed to see. The only lights visible were car, house and star lights.

d. Tuesday, 9 June 1959.

(1) Visited Mrs. of Tacoma, Va. She was reported to have been with the family on 5 April 1959 (see TAB C).

(2) Drove out to Bull Mountain on the road to St. Paul where Mr. claims to see strange lights. The road winds up through the mountains and there are houses in the valleys, and some on the mountain-side among the trees that cannot be seen during the day.

3


- page 115 -

(3) Attended a weekly meeting at the college, held by the Clinch Valley College Astronomy Club. Most of the boys stayed home studying for final examinations; therefore, very little was accomplished. However, we did get a description of a sighting made by Mr. [redacted] (see TAB 5).

While the meeting was in progress, a Mr. [redacted] of Johnson City, Tenn. came in. He wanted to talk to Professor Robinson concerning the strange lights in the area.

e. Wednesday, 10 June 1959.

(1) Drove to Norton, Va. to contact [redacted]. He had the picture taken of one of the objects. Also contacted Mr. [redacted] for his description of an object sighted by him (see TAB F).

(2) Drove to the Clinch Valley College to contact other members of the astronomical club who had witnessed the objects. Contacted Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] (see TAB D).

(3) Contacted [redacted] a young boy approximately 10-11 years old, concerning an object he had observed (see TAB E).

(4) Drove back to Coeburn and contacted Mr and Mrs [redacted]. The date of their observation was uncertain (see TAB H).

(5) Drove out toward Clintwood, Va. to Caney Ridge where several strange lights were observed by [redacted]. We were with the [redacted] and another young couple. Eventually, the [redacted] family showed up. While we were there a bright white flash was observed. One investigator said it was a car, but one of the women claimed it was above the mountain. The investigator pointed out that the mountain in question was fairly hard to distinguish from the dark sky, but she still insisted the light was above the mountain. The investigator was sure he had momentarily caught a glimpse of a red tail light at the same time the white light appeared. He suggested they keep watch to the left of the original sighting, and after about two

- page 116 -

or three minutes a car could be seen rounding a curve from right to left.
Another light was observed which disappeared and then seemed to reappear
at another location. The investigators thought that someone had probably
come to bed as it was very late, and some neighbor of the first had come
home. This theory was just laughed at. To the investigators, it had the
appearance of a distant house light. After watching in other areas, everyone
returned home.

f. Thursday, 11 June 1959.

(1) Drove to Clintwood to contact Mr. [redacted]. He was very
difficult to locate and when we finally located him, he didn't have very long
before going back to school (see TAB E).

(2) Drove to Haysi to contact Mr. [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] did not
live in Haysi and investigators had to drive back toward Clintwood. Source
lives south of Haysi several miles (see TAB B).

(3) Drove to High Knob which is situated approximately 10 miles
southwest of Coebum. It is a recreation area in a national forest. The
trees in this area are thick and tall this time of year, making it impossible
to see anywhere but up.

(4) Returned to Coebum for the evening. At approximately 2300,
a Mr. [redacted], a newspaper reporter, visited the investigators and
asked for information concerning the sightings. We could not give the
information requested and Mr. [redacted] was so informed. As he had observed
some of the strange lights we asked him for his description (see TAB F).

g. Friday, 12 June 1959.

(1) Drove to Darwin along Caney Ridge. Contacted several people
who live in the area concerning the unusual lights Mr. [redacted] claims to
have seen. No one in the area had observed anything out of the ordinary.

5


- page 117 -

(2) Talked to several people in Coeburn, including the Coeburn police; no new information could be learned.

h. Saturday, 13 June 1959.
(1) Visited Mr. [redacted], who lives on the outskirts of Coeburn. Mr. [redacted] gave a description of two separate sightings (see TABS A&E)

(2) Was visited by Mr. [redacted], an Army Reserve 1st Lt and a law student at Baltimore, Md. He had heard of the strange lights and drove to Coeburn to look around. He said he had talked to several people and went out one night with Mr. [redacted]. He said they saw a light and Mr. Estes declared there were no roads or houses where the light was. Mr. [redacted] said he went to the area the next day and saw houses among the trees and some roads in the area where the lights were seen. Mr. [redacted] said he had been up to the clearing on Sheeprock Mountain and found some ground under the brush that was charred. He was asked if it could have been from the camp fires that had been built there. He had no answer. He told the investigators of two people who saw something during the first of May. After about two hours he left.

4. Sunday, 14 June 1959.
(1) Drove to Toms Creek, Va. to contact the people who were reported to have seen a strange light. All that could be learned was that a woman by the name of [redacted] saw a momentary light travel across the sky.

Mr. [redacted] stated that he doesn't put much stock in these sightings. He was reluctant to give the investigators information concerning his sighting as he didn't think there was anything to it. He was positive there was a logical explanation for the lights. (See Tab P)

4. Analysis and conclusions.

4.1 The metal strips found in several locations surrounding Coburn, Va. are identical to one type of chaff used for jamming radar.

4.2 Due to the time lapse of up to three months between the sightings and the investigation, it is rather difficult to draw a valid conclusion as to the nature of the reported sightings. However, it is the considered opinion of the analyst that several things contributed to these sightings.

(1) The presence of a large number of open coke ovens in the area.
(2) The prevailing weather on most of the subject evenings.
(3) The apparent inability of some witnesses to determine when an automobile was traveling along a road located on top of a ridge.

- page 123 -

(4) The inexperience of witnesses with the appearance of astronomical bodies when observed under other than normal atmospheric conditions.

(5) The witnesses were out looking for strange lights, and as will always happen, some were observed. They looked so long and hard that they began seeing lights dance around.

(6) The power of suggestion cannot be discounted as being partly responsible for the sightings.

ATIC-4284                                                3 June 1959

MEMORANDUM FOR Colonel Vincent C. Rothman, ATIC-4284

SUBJECT:  UFO Program

1.  Wise-Coburg, Va. UFO sightings.

    a. The reorganization of the 1006th AISS with the associated reduction of personnel at the detachments is already having its effect upon UFO investigation.

    b. The ATIC received information from SAMS-3 (Major Tacker) of UFO sightings which occurred in the Wise-Coburg, Va. area from 5 March 1959, to 23 April 1959.  Contact was made with the 1006th AISS regarding an immediate investigation.

    c. The Wise-Coburg, Va. area is in the district assigned to Detachment 10 (Andrews AFB).  However, due to shortage of personnel at Detachment 10, the mission was assigned to Detachment 8, Wright-Patterson AFB.

    d. On 2 June 1959, Major Cooper of Detachment 8 contacted Major Friend of ATIC-4284g and informed him that his detachment had only one man of experience and one other available for this mission with the investigation.  Bollen of ATIC-4284g was allowed to assist with the investigation.  This was agreed to by Major Friend.

    e. In view of the importance of the reporting source and the extensiveness of the sightings, it appears that the assignment of T/Sgt. Bollen to this mission was justified.

2.  Proposed visit by Major Tacker (SAMS-3).

    a. Major Tacker called ATIC-4284g to announce a proposed visit to the ATIC for the purpose of collecting material for his book on UFO's.

    b. This book is to consist of eight chapters as follows:

        (1) Chapter I - A UFO Sighting.  (This is to be one case discussed at length)

        (2) Chapter II - History of Sources.

The rest of the text is too blurry and low-contrast to reliably OCR. While the text appears to be a newspaper article about flying saucer stories, the specific details are not clearly legible. The image shows two columns of text with a headline at the top, but the text itself cannot be accurately transcribed due to the poor image quality.
