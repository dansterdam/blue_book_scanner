The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that discusses five unresolved UFO sightings from 1953 that were sent to Dr. H. P. Robinson at the California Institute of Technology for review and comment. The sightings are mentioned to have occurred at Lake Erie, Continental Divide, Sea of Japan, and Port Huron, Michigan. The document also discusses a system of transmitting PILOTREPS (pilot reports) to the Millikan Observatory and the possibility that the planet Venus may be the cause of all the sightings coming from Japan in recent months.

IX. Recently Project Blue Book sent five of its best unresolved 1953 sightings to Dr. H. P. Robinson, California Institute of Technology, for his review and comment. The sightings included Lake Erie, Continental Divide, Sea of Japan, and Port Huron, Michigan.

IX. The system of transmitting PILOTREPS to Millikan Observatory with the possibility of identifying these as astronomical bodies is working out well. Their system was instrumental in identifying the object of the Darlington, Wisconsin, sighting as well as establishing the possibility that the planet Venus has been the cause for all the sightings coming from Japan in recent months.

Text from the document:

"WHAT'S SEEN? WAS IT FLYING SAUCER?
Was the bright fire which experts say was the Washington and Monroe, Wis., early Sunday morning, one of those things that are often seen and are so questionable - a flying saucer? 
The experts would like to know. What was it? The witnesses are making a report that it was just an ordinary jet Plane and flight was made over Darlington, Wis.
BALLOONS BILLED OUT
But officials of the Airport Weather Bureau station believed that Donny, 10, is almost certain the bright lights seen and reported were not a plane, but ordinary of the Airport station believed that Donny, 10, is almost certain the bright lights seen and reported were not a plane, but ordinary weather balloons released from that station. However, this is made positive, another flight tonight over highway 214 may solve the problem.
PUT - The balloons climb at an average speed of 1,000 feet per minute.... The twin balloons have been nearly invisible from the earth. And they ordinarily stay in the air about 2 hours.
So - what was it? Graham, a Monroe police sergeant, investigated and reported to police authorities later in the day that he could find no trace of anything unusual having happened. Only I saw an ordinary jet plane moving off towards the south.

HOVERS OVER MONROE
Whether picked up shortly Lawrence James and Louis Graham of Darlington - reported seeing a mysterious light over Monroe, a full south of the city, moving in a stationary position, then zooming off like a flash. At one time, the object hovered for 30 or 40 minutes over Monroe. Meantime, Monroe police and Green County sheriff's deputies were observing it. They watched it until 6:30, when the light began moving south.
The time for this was about 6:25, according to the sheriff's officer. 
So - what was it? A "flying saucer" or just an ordinary balloon? Some may say "flying saucer" if it stays in one position for 30 or 40 minutes, then zooms off in a flash. Others will say it was just a weather balloon. But the air station at the airport says the balloons released there were ordinary. So - what was it? Let the experts decide.

APPEAL FOR WITNESSES
We might have testimony that would identify what was seen if anyone else in the area saw it and would report on what they observed. If you did see it, will you please contact the Darlington Astronomical Society, Route 1, Darlington, Wis. They are very much interested in reports or observations of anything unusual in the sky."

UNCLASSIFIED

Darlington, Wisconsin 31 May 1953

I. DESCRIPTION
Between 0320 CST and 1130 CST on 31 May 1953, eleven persons in the Darlington-Wisconsin sighted an unidentified aerial object. The object appeared as a steady white light coming generally out of the East and disappearing to the high overhead after a period of continuous observation. It appeared low on the Eastern horizon, much brighter than the surrounding stars. It was reported to hover and then move in various directions with incredible speed, leaving no trail. A deluge pursued the object in their squad car without gaining any noticeable ground. 

II. DISCUSSION
A newspaper account of the sighting came to the attention of ATIC and as a result an officer and an airman were sent to the area of the sighting. They interviewed the various witnesses and obtained a variety of reports. Estimates of azimuth and elevation readings were obtained from different observers at various locations in Darlington for several spaced time intervals during the 8 hour period. The description of the object varied, however, some stating the object rose slowly, others noting it appeared to suddenly dart across the sky. The fact that it was too bright to be a star and moreover it was seen in the daytime.  

It was determined that the path of the object in question across the sky, its position at disappearance and disappearance, vary considerably from that observed at 0330 CST when it was seen at its approximate maximum brilliancy. Under ideal weather conditions it can be seen in the daytime, although its light is less. The fact that GOC personnel first sighted it at night and had the object photographed for daylight observation allowed them to observe the object through several intervals. Reports that the object was accelerating or decelerating the observer could not distinguish if the object was simply flashing or spinning. If Venus is starred at for any length of time without any blinking its object points at can appear to perform erratic maneuvers.

GOC personnel alerted the Chicago filter center and jets were scrambled to investigate. This was during daylight observation and the jets, although recognizing the object by visual direction, were unable to locate the unknown.

The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document seems to be a "Pilots Guide for Communicating with Airway Stations" and includes information on radio communication procedures and radio communication codes.

PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS
PILOTS - never hesitate to use your radio. Remember that talking by radio is almost the same as talking on your home telephone.
The following are typical examples of two-way communication with airway stations:
IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number.
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE".
IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number.
Example: "ATKINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE".
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER".
After the airway station has identified your make and certificate number, they will handle your message. The airway station will normally answer on the radio range or radiotelephony frequency. If a reply is desired on other than the radio range or radiotelephony frequency, indicate the frequency on which you desire the reply to be transmitted.
POINT ONE MEGACYCLES - OVER
After the airway station has answered your call, proceed with your message without further call or other than preceding the message with "OVER".
"STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - THIS IS CLEVELAND RADIO - AT ELEVEN TWENTY - FOUR THOUSAND FEET - OVER"
"ROGER - CLEVELAND RADIO - AT TOLEDO - OVER".

V.H.F. OMNI-RANGE (VOR)
The text describes how the V.H.F. omni-range system operates within the 112-118 megacycle band, providing guidance on any course to or from the station. It explains the function of various instruments and indicators used by pilots when flying the V.H.F. omni-range.

TABLE OF V.H.F. RECEPTION DISTANCES
The table lists the reception distances for V.H.F. and UHF frequencies for communication and navigation, based on the altitude of the station.

U.S. WEATHER BROADCASTS AND TRANSMISSIONS
This section discusses the continuously operated CAA (Civil Aeronautics Administration) radio range and radio beacon stations that provide weather information and forecasts to pilots. It describes the broadcast schedule and content, as well as the protocol for obtaining weather information.

The VHF omni-directional radio range provides azimuth information and course indication to aircraft when flying at relatively low altitudes. These ranges operate in the frequency band between 112 and 118 mc. Note that the azimuth indications are simultaneous voice communications and 1-letter (Morse code) identification. In operation, the pilot sets his course selector to the desired magnetic bearing and flies the aircraft to maintain a "needle-center" indication on his instruments. The needle will center when the aircraft is on the selected course.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

CRUISING ALTITUDES
CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - Aircraft at or more than 3000 feet above the ground. 
Eastbound flights, Aircraft making good a true course of from 0° to, but not including, 180°, along a green or red 
Westbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course of from 180°, to, but not including, 360°, along a green or red 
Northbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course of from 270°, to, but not including, 360°, along an amber or blue civil
Southbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course of from 90°, to, but not including, 270°, along an amber or blue civil
CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as illustrated below.

VISUAL FLIGHT PLANS
The Civil Air Regulations do not require that a Visual Flight Plan, as such, be submitted. However, the filing of such a flight plan is desirable, and in some cases is almost essential if the flight is to be conducted on an instrument basis. Flight plans may be submitted to the nearest CAA communications station in such cases where operational conditions are such that a flight plan is desirable. Flight plans may be filed by means of any communications channels available to the aircraft.
If filing the flight plan, the pilot should state the name of the CAA communications station with which he will close his flight plan. If the destination is not served by a CAA communications station, the method by which the arrival report will be filed must be clearly understood by all concerned. VFR flight plans are transmitted via CAA communication channels primarily for the purpose of flight following and rescue operations.
The flight plan shall contain the items listed under INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES - Flight Plan, except "Alternate Airports" and except that a Visual flight rule flight plan should always specify "VFR" as a cruising altitude. The use of this term is that of an explanatory note to indicate that the flight is being conducted in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. Aircraft may be flown in other than the altitudes specified in the flight plan, in accordance with VFR above a well defined cloud or to meet weather conditions, until an instrument clearance is received in accordance with VFR.
Pilots of aircraft operating on VFR flight plan who desire to make flight progress reports, should include in the report the phrase "ON FLIGHT PLAN" to indicate that a flight plan is in effect.

The shared image appears to be a page from a UFO report document and contains a chart titled "THE KOCH CHART FOR ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS". The chart displays information about how altitude and temperature affect aircraft performance. There is no photograph present in this image.

THE KOCH CHART FOR ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

TO FIND THE EFFECT OF ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE 
CONSULT THE TEMPERATURE AND AIRPORT ALTITUDE
BY A STRAIGHT LINE.

READ THE INCREASE IN TAKE-OFF DISTANCE AND THE
DECREASE IN RATE OF CLIMB FROM STANDARD SEA
LEVEL VALUES HERE.

EXAMPLE: The diagonal line shows that a 20% must
be added for a temperature of 100F and a pressure
altitude of 5,000 feet. Therefore, if your standard
temperature sea level distance is 1,000 feet, your
take-off distance at 5,000 feet and 100F will be 1,200
feet. In addition, the rate of climb would
be decreased 15%. Also, if your ground air speed
is 100 knots at sea level, it would now be reduced

TEXT TRANSCRIBED FROM THE IMAGE:

LOSS OF AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE DURING HOT WEATHER

This Air Reduction Life. You see this jet engine can function in hot weather. This lowers the temperature, the thinner the air.

Do you realize that Kansas City Airport with an elevation of 744 feet above see level can have an effective elevation identical to Denver, Colorado, at 5,279 feet above sea level, under condition of extreme heat and low pressure?

Do you realize that Brees Airport at Laramie, Wyoming, at 7,273 feet above sea level, can be above the safe operational altitude of your aircraft during hot weather?

Note: The effective elevation of Brees Airport is 8,997, for example, to 10,500 feet-Caution: The aircraft may lose a higher altitude, have an efficiency of engine and propeller, and become a pilots rate of climb. A typical 5,500 feet rate of climb may be reduced to only 525 feet per minute.

This plane might be able to clear a 400 foot hill or factory stack, located a few miles from a sea level airport, but if the pilot tried to gain 2,500 feet or above the middle or the obstruction - Remember: Any increase in operating altitude due to elevation or high temperature greatly increases takeoff and landing roll.

Miss C. Clucas 
Perkins Observatory

Columbus 10, Ohio

Dear Miss Clucas:

As I promised at our recent meeting at Ohio State, you will find enclosed a copy of the report of an unidentified light over Darlington, Wisconsin, on 31 May 1953. This was taken from the Dayton Journal. 

As yet, I have received no answer to our query to Max Field at Madison and as soon as this comes in, I will give you a call and we can compare notes.

Thanks again for your quick action on this matter. I hope you will mail this sighting down. I think probably Dr. Hynek is on the right track when he says that one was a meteor and the other a meteor and the other a meteor.

Best regards,

1st Lt R. H. Olsson

Transcription of the text in the document:

31 MAY - DARLINGTON, WISCONSIN 

Dear Dr. Hynek:

This concerns the press release on the Darlington sighting for which I requested assistance and should be forwarded to:

in Milwaukee immediately.

A synopsis of the Darlington sighting could go something like this:

Between 3:20 A.M. and 11:30 A.M. on 31 May eleven persons in the Darlington vicinity sighted an unidentified aerial object. The object appeared as a steady white light coming generally from the East and disappearing in the West. It moved at an extremely rapid rate and then at times it appeared to be hovering. Several local inhabitants including several county deputies and a Green River Corps observer saw the object in their squad car at 70 mph and said that the object seemed to be moving at a tremendous speed. The whole incident lasted approximately 8 hours.

A newspaper account of the incident came to the attention of the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Air Force Lt Colonel James McIsaac of the Intelligence Division and an officer from the Air Defense Command were dispatched to the area of sighting where they proceeded to investigate. The persons involved and attempted to place together the many reports. Two observers, one a county sheriff, sighted the object from the Darlington area and said that it appeared to be maneuvering toward Monroe.

Police dispatchers in Monroe alerted the local GOC post of the unknown object and were informed that the GOC had it under observation. This person later saw the object at 11:30 A.M. in broad daylight. The weather throughout the observation was clear with scattered clouds.

ATIC personnel obtained azimuth and elevations readings from different observers as various locations covering the 8 hour period. The description of the object turned out to be somewhat similar among observers - bright white. The descriptionchanged, some observers stating it moved slowly, others saying it moved at great speed and then hovered. ALL agreed that the object was too bright to be a star and moreover it was seen in the daytime.

- page 31 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report containing typed text.

OCR output:

It was determined that the path of the object in question, that is the position of appearance and disappearance, very closely paralleled the path of the planet Venus. Venus on 31 May, 1953 is in the same direction and about the same apparent size as the observed object. Usually observers can detect it. If Venus is starred at for any length of time, it will appear much larger periodically and attain great apparent speeds all these characteristics having been attributed to the unknown object sighted over Darlington.

General Outlook on Project Blue Books

Since 1947 3,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects have been turned in to the Air Force. In 1952 there were 1,700 reports (the highest yearly figure). The Air Force investigates each report and feels that it can explain to 90% the known phenomena as unusual cloud formations, reflections, astronomy phenomena or mistaken objects. There is always 10% which cannot be explained to the Air Force's satisfaction. Some of these are certainly genuine reports from highly credible people, others are so sketchy that they aren't worth scientific investigation.

Some of the phenomena which have caused "flying saucers" to be reported are things as natural balloons observed in the daytime with the sun glinting off them so they look like flying discs, Venus or other planets reflecting sunlight off them which gives the appearance of light phenomenon. As a result of fear or clouds or unusual weather there are some unidentified reports. However a majority of these reports are easily explained by simple phenomena easily understood by people qualified in that field.

The Air Force does not pretend to be able to explain all flying saucers observed about the
entire subject to say that there is no existing danger to the United States. It believes 95 there possibly is something to cause undue speculation or hysteria of all of our sightings so far have been explained. The Air Force believes that it has the responsibility of ensuring the public with as much confidence as possible and so concentrates on evaluating and explaining its own sightings.

Sincerely,

R. M. GIBSON

Report of J. A. Hynek
on the Darlington-Shullsburg sighting
31 May 1955

The nature of the newspaper and other reports including those obtained personally by telephone from two of the original observers led this investigator to believe that the incident was worthy of detailed investigation. The reports were conflicting, as evidenced, for instance, by the following excerpts:

"...an enormous blue-white light like a second moon."
"...it was suddenly getting brighter than usual."
"...like a balloon with an internal blue-white light."
"...it didn't look much bigger than a star. It seemed to waver, moving south a ways, then straight up, then south again."
"...as big as the moon."
"...it passed slightly to the south of Darlington, between us and the moon."
"...stayed in front of them, although they were going seventy miles an hour."
"...about the size of a grapefruit, traveling very high and almost due East."
"...prominent of light drifting westwardly."

It was felt by this investigator that if this case could be cleared up it might shed light on similar reports and particularly on the vagaries of the human element in reporting. Accordingly, this investigator and Lt. R. Olsson journeyed to Traux Field, Madison, Wis.

The text in the document reads as follows:

where they were extended the courtesy of a staff car and a driver. 
It might be best, if the reader does not wish to study the 
interrogation in any detail, to state the opinions of these two 
investigators.
It is the considered opinion of this investigator ( and 
concurred in by Lt. Olsson) at the conclusion of the interrogation 
of about a dozen people that the object sighted was the planet Venus. 
This, despite the flamboyant descriptions of size and motion given 
by some observers, the conclusion is based on the fact that whenever 
it was possible to obtain actual positions (altitude-azimuth) of 
sightings from numerous independent observers, the positions and times 
corresponded very closely with the calculated positions of the planet 
Venus from 0320 to 1120 on 31 May 1953. That is, there was no residual 
specific evidence that the object was sighted in any other portion of 
the sky than that occupied by Venus. In particular, no agreement what-
ever was obtained concerning rapid angular velocities where an agreement 
was very strong as to position during the eight hour interval of obser-
vation. The evidence however does not exclude the possibility that a 
bright meteor traveling toward, and disappearing at, the approximate 
rising position of Venus, had been the triggering incident, although it 
seems more probable to the investigators that the observers' first glimpse 
of Venus (then nearly at its most brilliant phase) rising in the east may 
have given the momentary illusion of rapid motion. It must be remembered 
that none of the observers were tutored in matters astronomical, and hence 
unaware that on occasion Venus can be so bright as to be visible in the 
daytime.

- page 35 -

There is no photograph present in this document. The text describes an investigation into a sighting of an object in the eastern sky, with details about the itinerary of the investigation, the observations of the investigators, and the involvement of local amateur astronomer Durel Guess.

The Itinerary of investigation was as follows:
Mr. Scherer, head of the GOC at Monroe, Wisconsin, was the first to be questioned. He was closely followed by Mr. Ruley, Mr. Hallaway, Mr. Guess and others, all of the GOC post. Mr. Hallaway was requested to remain at the observation post throughout the night to note the rising of Venus and its visibility after daylight. The investigators then proceeded to Darlington, promising to return to check with Mr. Hallaway after dawn.

Mr. Glenn Winslow, policeman at Darlington, met the investigators in his patrol car and "reinacted the episode" as faithfully as his memory permitted. He was quite vague about the original sighting but much surer about the position and later motion of the object in the eastern sky. He drove the investigators to the point from which he radioed police officers in Monroe (to the east of Darlington) telling them that an object was approaching at great speed. The investigators contacted Monroe officers via the Winslow car radio and interviews were arranged for later in the morning. Mr. Winslow in particular was unable to reconcile the notion of rapid motion with the fact that he observed the object for several hours. His ability as an observer must unfortunately be given a very low rating. He appeared more intent on repeating vague statements than on attempting to be specifically helpful.

The investigators returned to Monroe and found not only Hallaway at the observation post but about half-dozen observers. One of these, Durel Guess, local amateur astronomer, had set up his telescope and was following Venus into the daytime sky. They again checked their original sighting of the position made with reference to the edge of the observing shack and found no discrepancies.

Text extracted from the document:

again that these agreed closely with the diurnal positions of Venus.
As we left, Guess admitted that the object seen had most probably been Venus.

Finally, we interrogated the city and county police officers who had been alerted by radio call from witnesses. We were particularly anxious to discover whether anyone had seen the object approach from the west — the direction of the town of Darlington. No one had. Without exception all observers, questioned independently, pointed out sky positions which agreed closely with those of Venus, although they were totally unaware of this fact. Although several stated the object moved rapidly, not one placed the object in any other position in the sky than that occupied by Venus at the various times of observation.

The interrogations satisfied the investigators beyond all reasonable doubt that the positions of the object sighted over the total eight hour period were also those of the planet Venus, unless therefore, one should be willing to strain credulity and state that the mysterious object should have by coincidence occupied the sky positions of Venus over this relatively long period. One must conclude that the object observed was Venus.

One striking thing, however, is revealed by this interrogation, and that is the ease with which Venus could be seen in broad daylight. This in itself is unusual since ordinarily Venus even when at its brightest is difficult to pick out in the sky and is not at all easily pointed out to a casual observer. We must conclude that the meteorological conditions on the morning of 31 May must have been exceptional, particularly with respect to freedom from haze, to which the majority of observers attested.

INFO:
PRCM: APOLLO-ATLAS-6-1-8 FOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
ATIC has received a newspaper report of an unidentified flying object seen over Darlington, Wis., on or about 31 May at 0315 CST. Object was described as "enormous blue-white light like a second moon" and was observed by following persons: (1) Glen Winslow, local policeman; (2) United Press correspondent; and (3) Lawrence James, county sheriff. Object was described as lighting up the countryside. Observers stated that volunteer D.E.C. spotters in area also sighted the light. The article states that the Air Force scrambled jets to identify the unknown. Blue Book requests your office investigate this sighting and submit standard AF Form 112. Suggest you investigate possibility of the object being a very bright meteor. Another possibility would be local weather balloon flights. Request you forward winds aloft from 5 to 40,000 ft. at the date and time of sighting. How long was the object seen?

NOTES FROM ORIGINAL PHONE CALL TO CHICAGO FILTER CENTER,
1 JUNE 1953, 1600c.

JRG Talked to Lt. Walters, USAF, Operations Officer, CHI. :

O.R. ANZ236, Monroe, Wise.
Chief Observer : "Astronomer" observer:
31 May 53, 0430 to 1005c.

what about the possibility that it was Venus - that the condition of the atmosphere was just right to produce "wandering" effect and enable it to be seen after the sun was quite high.

If this were true, then the Radar blip would have to be accounted for otherwise.

Q: Did the object change position with respect to the sun? 
This would make or break the Venus theory.

One of the first persons to see
the object was Policeman Glenn
Windus of Darlington. He said it
was out when, at about 3:15 a.m.
he noticed it.
Windus said the light seemed
to darken, then brighten, then
darken again, growing smaller
and finally disappearing. 
The sheriff of Lafayette county, who was awakened by two
resident for this area, who accompanied Window to a hill on the
edge of Darlington. They were
found there by Lafayette County
Sheriff Lawrence A. Reale.
All the witnesses agreed the
light was shaped like a globe --
either white in color or changing
from white to blue-white light"
They set until each past seven,
watching the object.
Mrs. C.S. Gowan, a reporter on
the Monroe Sentinel, also said she
saw the strange light.

WASHBURN OBSERVATORY
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN

MADISON 6, WISCONSIN

June 6, 1953

Miss Jennie R. Cluck
Investigative Research
Emerson McMillin Observatory
Ohio State University
Columbus 10, Ohio

Dear Miss Cluck:

We have no eye-witness reports of the phenomenon observed in southwestern Wisconsin on the morning of the 31st of May, 1953. It would seem to be a duplication of effort for us to attempt an investigation of this sort, since the fighter squadron based at Truax Field, Madison, does not wish us to handle any cases of this type.

Captain John K. Fox informs me that he has made a report through Air Force channels of his investigation. He believes that it was moonlight on some scattered low-lying clouds against a background of high overcast. This does not constitute a report about which I see about attention is needed.

Very truly yours,

A.E. Whitford
Director

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing an incident that occurred on May 31, 1953 in Darlington, Wisconsin.

The text in the document is as follows:

Darlington, Wisconsin 
31 May 1953

I. DESCRIPTION:
Between 0320 CST and 1130 CST on 31 May 1953, eleven persons in the Darlington-Monroe area in Wisconsin sighted an unidentified aerial object. The object appeared as a steady white light coming generally out of the east and disappearing high overhead after 8 hours of continuous observation. It appeared low on the eastern horizon, much brighter than the surrounding stars. It was reported to hover and then move at terrific speeds by several local inhabitants, including several county sheriffs and Ground Observer Corps members. Two of the policemen pursued the object in their squad car without gaining any noticeable ground. A telescope was employed to view the phenomena by the GOC members. The weather during the time of sighting was unusually clear with a few scattered clouds carried on a north heading by the wind.

II. DISCUSSION:
A newspaper account of the sighting came to the attention of ATIC and as a result an officer and an astronomer were sent to the area of the sighting. They interrogated eight of the eleven observers in attempting to piece together the variety of reports. Estimates of azimuth and elevation readings were obtained from different observers at varied locations in Monroe and Darlington for evenly spaced time intervals during the 8 hour period. The description of the object turned out to be the same with all observers - bright white. The description of the maneuvers varied, however, some stating the object rose slowly, others saying it moved at great speeds, and then hovered. The latter description usually came from observers while riding in a car. All agreed that the object was too bright to be a star and moreover it was seen in the daytime.

- page 81 -

The image contains a photograph or diagram that appears to be related to the report. It shows a diagram with various labeled locations, including "Darlington", "D. Monroe", and "Chicago". There is also some handwritten text at the top and bottom of the image.

It was determined that the path of the object in question across the sky, its position at appearance and disappearance, very closely paralleled the path of the planet Venus on 31 May 1953. Venus on this day rose at 0310 CST and was at its approximate maximum brilliancy. Under ideal weather conditions it can be seen in the daytime, although this is rare. The fact that GCI personnel sighted it at night and that the object participated for daylight observation allowed them to keep it under constant surveillance. 

Reports that the object maneuvered radically usually came from persons driving in cars while observing the object. If Venus is stared at for any length of time without any balancing reference point, it can appear to perform erratic maneuvers.

GCI personnel alerted the Chicago filter center and jets were scrambled to investigate. This was during daylight observation and the jets, although vectored toward the object by visual directions from Darlington, were unable to locate the unknown.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text document from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

8 June 1953

1st Lt. Roger Olsson
ATTN: Electronics Officer APS
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Lt. Olsson,

In connection with the sightings of 21 May in Wisconsin the following phone calls were made for additional information:

(1) To Mr. Glenn Winslow, a Darlington police officer, who reported he saw object first at 0315 overhead, moved it, could see it move, was bright enough for sight observations, did not appear to be a meteor, and disappeared in 15 seconds. Police radio station did not keep up with it. Direction of object changed to South later. Object was observed by Winslow for more than a house estimating distance as daylight.
Overhead sighting, brightness, apparent motion, W heading and change in direction rule out Venus.

(2) Winslow states that police officers in Monroe sighted the same object. Winslow familiar with Venus states object was not Venus. Was asked to observe Venus before sunrise but police officers could locate. Cited object almost as large as the moon.

(3) Called J.B. Sharer, Monroe COG Observation Post. Object not reported to his until 0615 - Object sparkling and difficult to pick up, moving west. Was directly South at 0900. NGTE: Venus on that day was directly South at 0900. His evidence ALL points to Venus.

(4 & 5) Jamie also called Chicago and Green Bay Filter Centers to see if the object was picked up on their radar screens. Green Bay had no direct reports but later sent down a newspaper clipping from Darlington paper - Chicago had 2 radar tracks on an object supposedly the same as seen on ground. The radar was picking up a moving target.

It seems probable on the present evidence that some observers saw Venus and others identified did not and probably saw a balloon.
