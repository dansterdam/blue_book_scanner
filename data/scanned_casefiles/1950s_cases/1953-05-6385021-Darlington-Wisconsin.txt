II. Recently Project Blue Book sent five of its best unsolved 1953 sightings to Dr. N. P. Robinson, California Institute of Technology, for his review and comment. The sightings included Luke AFB, Continental Divide, Sea of Japan, and Port Huron, Michigan.

III. The system of transmitting FLXORPTS to McMillan Observatory with the possibility of identifying them as astronomical bodies is working out well. Their system was instrumental in identifying the object of the Darlington, Wisconsin, sighting as well as establishing the possibility that the planet Venus has been the cause for all the sightings coming from Japan in recent months.

Flying What's Seen Was It Flying Saucer?

Was the bright disc which floated over Darlington and Monroe, Wis., early Sunday morning one of those things that astronomers modestly term a "questionable object" — flying saucer to us ordinary laymen?

The experts would like to know. So would a good many people who saw it, including sheriff and police officers of the two towns.

Southern Wisconsin was alerted by police at 3:15 a.m. by Darlington Police Officer Glen Winkler, who sighted a bright blue-white light. He reported it, and Jasper Hein, the night watchman at the city, moving northwest of the city, was alarmed.

HOVERED OVER MONROE

Windom picked up Sheriff Lawrence James and Lyons Green at Darlington, Wis. At 3:15 a.m. they stood on a hill south of the city watching the light. Monroe sheriff's officer John Lewis, a night dispatcher at the Monroe sheriff's office, said at 6:20, "I didn't look much bigger than a star. It seemed to waver, moving south a ways, then straight up. Then south again. The sheriff's department had sent a car out Highway 11. It is slowed up."

Sir, director of the Milwaukee Astronomical Observatory, said he would appreciate details from anyone who saw the object, giving details. He collects all such information for a permanent record.

BALLOONS RULED OUT

But officials of the Airport Weather Bureau station believed that theory, too, is almost ruled out. Balloons float 4 feet across when 7 feet high, and this was much larger.

But — the balloons climb at an average 1,000 feet a minute. Within 15 minutes they would have been nearly invisible from earth. And they ordinarily stay aloft only 45 to 50 minutes.

Bee-what was it? Graham commented:

"I'm inclined to pooh-pooh the whole thing — only I saw it myself."

APPEALS FOR WITNESSES

The article suggests it might have been a weather balloon, so no clear conclusion was reached.

The document also has a letterhead for the Milwaukee Astronomical Society at 2091 South 12 Street, Milwaukee 15, Wisconsin, with some handwritten notes.

Darlington, Wisconsin                                                  31 May 1953

I.    DESCRIPTION

Between 0320 CST and 1130 CST on 31 May 1953, eleven persons in the Darling-
ton-Monroe area in Wisconsin sighted an unidentified aerial object. The object
appeared as a steady white light coming generally out of the East and disappear-
ing high overhead after 8 hours of continuous observation. It appeared low on
the Eastern horizon, much brighter than the surrounding stars. It was reported
to hover and then move at terrific speeds by several local inhabitants, includ-
ing several county sheriffs and Ground Observer Corps members. Two of the police-
men pursued the object in their squad car with the GOC members. A telescope
was employed to view the phenomenon by the GOC members. The weather
during the time of sighting was unusually clear with a few scattered clouds
carried on a north heading by the wind.

II.   DISCUSSION

A newspaper account of the sighting came to the attention of ATIC and as a
result an officer and an astronomer were sent to the area of the sighting. They
interviewed eight of the eleven observers in attempting to piece together the
variety of reports. Estimates of azimuth and elevation readings were obtained
from different observers at varied locations in Monroe and Darlington for
evenly spaced time intervals during the 8 hour period. The description of the
object turned out to be the same with all observers - bright white. The des-
cription of the maneuvers varied, however, some stating the object rose slowly,
others saying it moved at great speeds, and then hovered. The latter description
usually came from observers while riding in a car. ALL agreed that the object
was too bright to be a star and moreover it was seen in the daytime.

It was determined that the path of the object in question across the sky,
its position at appearance and disappearance, very closely paralleled the path
of the planet Venus on 31 May 1953. Venus on this day rose at 0310 CST and was
at its approximate maximum brilliancy. Under ideal weather conditions it can be
seen in the daytime, although this is rare. The fact that GOC personnel first
sighted it at night and had the object pin-pointed for daylight observation al-
lowed them to keep it under constant surveillance. Reports that the object man-
euvered radically usually came from persons driving in cars while observing the
object. If Venus is starred at for any length of time without experiencing ref-
erence point, it can appear to perform erratic maneuvers.

GOC personnel alerted the Chicago filter center and jets were scrambled to
investigate. This was during daylight observation and the jets, although vec-
tored towards the object by visual directions from Darlington, were unable to locate
the unknown.

Here is the text from the document:

SEARCH AND RESCUE
Search and Rescue Service is a life saving service provided through the combined efforts of the CAA, Air Force, and Coast Guard who are assisted by other organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Sheriffs Air Patrol, State Police, and such other agencies as may be available. It provides search, survival aid, and rescue of personnel of missing or crashed aircraft.

All you need to remember to obtain this valuable protection is:
1. File a Flight Plan with a CAA Airway Communications Station in person or by telephone or radio.
2. File an Arrival Report.
3. If you land at a location other than intended destination, report the landing to the nearest CAA Communications Station.
4. If you land enroute and are delayed more than an hour, report this information to the nearest communications station.
5. Remember that if you fail to report within one hour after your E.T.A., a search will be started to locate you. If you fail to report within three hours after your E.T.A., the full facilities of the Search and Rescue Service will be activated.

Searches are expensive, they inconvenience other people, and on numerous occasions the lives of other pilots are sacrificed when searching for lost or overdue pilots. SO, FILE AN ARRIVAL REPORT!

PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS

The following are typical examples of two-way communication with airway stations.

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRWAY STATIONS: CAA Airway Communications Stations are identified by the name of the station followed by the word "RADIO".
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO"

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE"
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE"

INITIAL CONTACT WITH AIRWAY RADIO: THIS IS - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER.

After communication has been established, an abbreviated form of identification may be used, if desired, using the last three units of the certificate number only.

The airway station will normally answer on the radio range or radiobeacon frequency. If reply is desired on other than the radio range or radiobeacon frequency, pilots should indicate the frequency on which the station will reply is expected.

Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - REPLY ON ONE ELEVEN POINT ONE MEGACYCLES - OVER".

After the airway station has answered your call, proceed with your message without further call up other than preceding the message with the aircraft identification. Your message may consist of your position report, a request for weather data or other information that may be required to assist you to your destination.

Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER CLEVELAND AT ELEVEN TWENTY - FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET PASSING OVER TOLEDO - WHAT IS THE WEATHER AT TOLEDO - OVER".

If you are flying VFR, a position report is not required, however, it is to your advantage that the stations along your route of flight know your position. A brief call in order that such assistance can be rendered should you encounter difficulty. Flight plans may be filed while in flight, with a CAA Airway Communications Station, if your departure was from an airport not served by such a station.

The word "ROGER" is used to acknowledge receipt of a message.
The word "OUT" is used when a conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - ROGER, OUT".

The words "SAY AGAIN" are used if a message was not understood and a repetition is desired.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - SAY AGAIN, OVER".
The words "STAND BY" are used to indicate that a return call will be made as soon as practicable.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - STAND BY".

ENROUTE FLIGHT SERVICE
All airway communications stations are ready to provide pilots with enroute flight information or assistance at any time. You may call any CAA RADIO for latest weather along your route of flight, upper wind velocities, airport conditions, and other flight information. If you become lost or uncertain of your position, call any CAA RADIO. Personnel at CAA airway communications stations are trained to assist pilots in establishing radio contact by any of the following methods: (a) Visual reference to terrain features; (b) Low frequency radio range orientation; (c) VHF omni-range indications (triangulation).

RADIOTELEGRAPH CODE
[A complete radiotelegraph code chart is included, listing letters A-Z with their corresponding Morse code representations]


- page 21 -

V.H.F. OMNI-RANGE (VOR)

The V.H.F. omni-range operates within the 112-118 megacycle band. In this band it is relatively free from atmospheric and precipitation static and interferences from other radio stations. Furthermore, it is not limited to four courses as is the A-N range, but provides definite guidance on any course, to or from the station, the pilot may select. That is why it is called the Omni (Directional) Range. At minimum instrument altitudes the VOR gives reliable indications up to about 50 miles, depending on en route terrain.

In flying the V.H.F. omni-range, the pilot uses three basic instruments. The first is the Flight Path Deviation Indicator (cross-pointer instruments), the same type used for the visual-aural range (VAR) and the ILS localizer. The vertical needle of this instrument indicates the pilot whether he is right or left of the desired course. The second is an Omni-bearing Selector, manually operated by the rotation of a small knob, by which the pilot selects the course he desires to fly. When the cross-pointer needle is centered, the omni-bearing selector indicates that the aircraft is either on the course selected or "TO" or "FROM" the station. The third is a "TO-FROM" indicator which shows whether the bearing indicated by the Omni-bearing Selector is from or to the station. Furthermore, the "TO-FROM" needle can tell a flier when his aircraft is too far from the VOR or is otherwise receiving a weak signal.

In operation, the pilot selects a course by adjusting the omni-bearing selector to the desired magnetic bearing, and then maintaining it by keeping the cross-pointer needle centered. If the aircraft is correctly aligned with the TO-FROM needle vertical, the needle swings to the right, for example, indicates that the course selected lies to the right.

For example, an aircraft is due south of a VOR station. If its planes to fly to the station, he sets the omni-bearing selector to indicate 0°. The "TO-FROM" indicator will then point to the word "TO". As the aircraft passes over the station the "TO-FROM" indicator will point to the word "FROM". If a turn of 180° is made north of the station, although the vertical cross-pointer needle will again become centered, the "TO-FROM" indicator will still point to "FROM". The pilot, however, will now find that he must fly "Away from the needle" to stay on course. This shows him that the "TO-FROM" indicator is incorrect. So, the pilot now rotates his omni-bearing selector to 180°. After he has done this, the "TO-FROM" indicator shifts to the "TO" position, and flying "Toward the needle" will keep him on course.

TABLE OF V.H.F. RECEPTION DISTANCES

With the increasing use of VHF and UHF frequencies for communication and navigation it appears desirable to publicize the reception distances for these frequencies. They, therefore, are tabulated below:

[Table showing Reception Distances for various Feet Above Ground Station heights]

U.S. WEATHER BROADCASTS AND TRANSMISSIONS

All continuously operated CAA radio range and radio beacon stations having voice facilities on the range or radio beacon frequencies broadcast weather reports and airway information at 15 and 45 minutes past each hour. The 15-minute past-the-hour broadcast is an "airway" broadcast consisting of weather reports from important terminals located on airway (s) within approximately 400 miles of the station. The 45-minute-past-the-hour broadcast is an "area" broadcast consisting of weather reports from locations within the flight information area of the station.

The broadcast consists of the local weather report and the latest available surface reports from other locations. Reports more than one hour old are not broadcast. Local winds aloft are broadcast at times after the broadcasts at 6:15 and 12:15 A.M. and P.M., E.S.T.

At selected stations the Weather Bureau provides a local terminal forecast covering the next two hours. This forecast is broadcast, when available, immediately following the local weather report.

Pilots enroute are requested to avoid, if possible, calling airway communications stations at or about 15 and 45 minutes past the hour (which are the scheduled broadcast times) to request weather information, as such calls may delay starting of scheduled broadcasts and cause inconvenience to others who are dependent on the broadcasts for weather reports.

The VHF omni-directional range provides visual track guidance along any selected radial from the station out to a distance of approximately 50 miles when flying at the minimum instrument altitude. These ranges operate in the frequencies between 112 and 118 megacycles and require a special omni range type receiver to make use of the navigational features. Also provided are simultaneous voice communications and 3-letter (coded) identification. In operation, the pilot selects a course by setting the pointer on a course or radial sector to the desired magnetic bearing and then flies that course by reference to a cross pointer instrument.

CRUISING ALTITUDES

CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES—Aircraft at or more than 3000 feet above the surface within control areas and/or control zones shall be flown at an altitude appropriate to the direction of flight. "Odd and even" indicators are shown on Coast and Geodetic Survey Radio Facility Charts.

The following rules will govern the altitude at which aircraft shall fly when making flights along civil airways:

Green and Red Airways
Eastbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course from 0° (or 360°), to, but not including, 180° along a green or red civil airway shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).
Westbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course from 180° to, but not including, 360° (or 0°) along a green or red civil airway shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 2000, 4000, or 6000 feet).

Amber and Blue Airways
Northbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course of from 270° to, but not including, 90° along an amber or blue civil airway shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).
Southbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course of from 90° to, but not including, 270° along an amber or blue civil airway shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 2000, 4000, or 6000 feet).

CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES—When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as illustrated below.

[A circular diagram showing magnetic headings and corresponding altitudes is included]

VISUAL FLIGHT PLANS

The Civil Air Regulations require that a VFR flight plan be filed for a VFR flight. However, the filing of such a flight plan is desirable, and the CAA urges that VFR flights be covered by flight plan whenever practicable to assist in search and rescue operations if such action becomes necessary. Flight plans may be submitted to the nearest CAA airway communications station either in person or by telephone. Flight plans may be filed by radio if no other means are available but this practice should be avoided whenever possible to reduce congestion of radio channels.

take-off distance at sea level for a 1,000 feet of
climb is 50 feet, normally requires 1,000 feet of
runway, it would become 3,300 feet under the conditions shown. In addition, the rate of climb would

120 feet per minute.

LOSS OF AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE DURING HOT WEATHER

Thin Air Reduces Lift. You get thin air at high altitudes and in hot weather. The hotter the temperature, the thinner the air.

Do you realize that Kansas City Airport with an elevation of 744 feet above sea level can have an effective elevation identical to Stapleton Field, Denver, at 5326 feet above sea level, under conditions of extreme heat and low pressure?

Do you realize that Brees Airport at Laramie, Wyoming, at 7273 feet above sea level, can be above the safe operational altitude of your aircraft during hot weather?

Note: The effective elevation at Brees Airport at 88°F, for example, is 10,250 feet. Caution!

The rarefied air at higher altitudes lowers the efficiency of engine and propeller, and lessens a plane's rate of climb. A typical light plane has a maximum rate of climb at sea level of 450 feet per minute, whereas its maximum rate of climb is 5,000 feet altitude.

This plane might be able to clear a 400 foot hill or factory stack located a few miles from a sea level airport, but if the pilot tried it at 5,000 feet, he would smack right into the middle of the obstruction.

Remember: Any increase in operating altitude (due to elevation or high temperature) greatly increases take-off and landing roll.

Dear Miss Gloekl:

As I promised at our recent meeting at Ohio State, you will find inclosed a copy of the report on an unidentified light over Darlington, Wisconsin on 31 May 1953. This was taken from the Dayton Journal Herald.

As yet, I have received no answer to our query to Truax Field at Madison and as soon as this comes in, I will give you a call and we can compare notes.

Thanks again for your quick action on this matter; I hope we can nail this sighting down. I think probably Drs. Hynek is on the right track when he says that one was more of an the other Venus.

Best regards,

1st Lt R. M. Olsson

15 June 53

Dr. A. J. Hynek
McKillin Observatory
Ohio State University
Columbus, Ohio

Dear Dr. Hynek:

This concerns the press release on the Darlington sighting for Mr. [redacted] reporter acquaintance and should be forwarded to Mr. [redacted] in Milwaukee immediately.

A synopsis of the Darlington sighting could go something like this:

Between 3120 A.M. and 11:30 A.M. on 31 May eleven persons in the Darlington-Monroe area in Wisconsin sighted an unidentified aerial object. The object appeared as a steady white light coming generally out of the east and disappearing high overhead after eight hours of observation. It was reported to hover and then attain terrific speeds by several local inhabitants including several county sheriffs and Ground Observer Corps members. Two policemen pursued the object in their squad car at 70 mph and said that the object seemed to be attracting them. A telescope was employed to view the phenomenon by the GOC observers.

A newspaper account of the incident came to the attention of the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, the Air Force organization officially responsible for investigating such reports. As a result, an officer and an astronomer were dispatched to the area of sighting where they proceeded to investigate. All the persons involved and attempted to place together the many reports. Two observers, one a county sheriff, sighted the object from Darlington, Wisconsin, and since it appeared to be going toward Monroe, it was alerted by radio.

Police dispatchers in Monroe alerted the local GOC post of the unknown object and were informed that the COC had it under observation. This post last saw the object at 11:30 A.M. in broad daylight. The weather throughout the observation was clear with scattered clouds.

ATIC personnel obtained azimuth and elevations readings from different observers at varied locations for different times covering the 8 hour period. The description of the object turned out to be the same with all observers - bright white. The description of maneuvers varied, however, some stating the object moved slowly, others saying it moved at great speeds and then hovered.

All agreed that the object was too bright to be a star and moreover it was seen in the daytime.


- page 31 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

that is its position at appearance and disappearance, very closely paralleled the path of the planet Venus. Venus on 31 May 1953 is near its maximum visibility and under ideal weather conditions can be seen in the daytime, although this is rare. Usually only trained observers can detect it. If Venus is stared at for any length of time, it will appear to maneuver erratically and attain great speeds, all these characteristics having been attributed to the unknown object sighted over Darlington.

General Outlook on Project Blue Book:

Since 1947 3,000 reports of unidentified aerial objects have been turned in to the Air Force. In 1952 alone 1700 reports were received. The Air Technical Intelligence Center objectively examines each report and feels that it can explain 60 to 90% as known phenomena or mirage objects. There is, however, the remaining 15% which cannot be explained to the Air Force's satisfaction. Some of these are truly perplexing reports from highly credible people, others are so sketchy that they aren't worth scientific investigation.

Some of the phenomena which have caused "flying saucer" reports are such things as weather balloons observed in the daytime with the sun glinting off them or at night with their pilot light visible; upper air research balloons; aircraft under peculiar light conditions; astronomical activity such as meteor showers, bright planets such as Venus, etc.; light phenomena as a result of ice crystals or clouds; "sun dogs" or a second mock image of the sun due to cloud conditions. There are some unidentified radar returns, however, a majority of them are caused by frequency interference, temperature or dew point inversions, and thunderstorms. The best type of sighting ATIC receives as far as instrumentation or scientific data is concerned are the combination visual and radar detections.

The Air Force does not pretend to be able to explain all "flying saucer" reports but it does feel that it knows enough about the entire subject to say that there is no existing danger to the United States nor is there anything to cause undue speculation or hysteria. Of all sightings 80 or 90% have been explained. The Air Force believes that it has the responsibility of assuring itself and the public with as much completeness as possible on a sometimes nebulous subject, that nothing unforeseen is going on in our skies. After reviewing 3,000 reports with ATIC and general scientific opinion which it has consulted find that there is absolutely no proof that space travel from another planet is going on.

Sincerely,

R. L. OLSSON

Report of J. A. Hynek
on the Darlington/Monroe sighting
31 May 1953

The nature of the newspaper and other reports including those obtained personally by telephone from two of the original observers led this investigator to believe that the incident was worthy of detailed investigation. The reports were conflicting, as evidenced, for instance, by the following excerpts:

"...an enormous blue-white light like a second moon."

"...it was suddenly getting brighter than usual."

"...like a balloon with an internal blue-white light."

"...it didn't look much bigger than a star. It seemed to waver, moving south a ways, then straight up, then south again."

"...as big as the moon."

"...it passed slightly to the south of Darlington, between us and the moon."

"...stayed in front of them, although they were going seventy miles an hour."

"...about the size of a grapefruit, traveling very high and almost due East."

"...pinpoint of light drifting westwardly."

It was felt by this investigator that if this case could be cleared up it might shed light on similar reports and particularly on the vagaries of the human element in reporting. Accordingly, this investigator and Lt. R. Olsson journeyed to Truax Field, Madison, Wisc.,

where they were extended the courtesy of a staff car and a driver.
It might be best, if the reader does not wish to study the
interrogation in any detail, to state the opinions of these two
investigators.

It is the considered opinion of this investigator ( and
concurred in by Lt. Olsson) at the conclusion of the interrogation
of about a dozen people that the object sighted was the planet Venus.
This, despite the flamboyant descriptions of size and motion given
by some observers, the conclusion is based on the fact that whenever
it was possible to obtain actual positions (altitude-azimuth) of
sightings from numerous independent observers, the positions and times
corresponded very closely with the calculated positions of the planet
Venus from 0320 to 1120 on 31 May 1953. That is, there was no residual
specific evidence that the object was sighted in any other portion of
the sky than that occupied by Venus. In particular, no agreement whatever was obtained concerning rapid angular velocities where as agreement
was very strong as to position during the eight hour interval of observation. The evidence however does not exclude the possibility that a
bright meteor traveling toward, and disappearing at, the approximate
rising position of Venus, had been the triggering incident, although it
seems more probable to the investigators that the observers' first glimpse
of Venus (then nearly at its most brilliant phase) rising in the east may
have given the momentary illusion of rapid motion. It must be remembered
that none of the observers were tutored in matters astronomical, and hence
unaware that on occasion Venus can be so bright as to be visible in the
daytime.


- page 35 -

The itinerary of investigation was as follows:

Mr. Scherer, head of the COC at Monroe, Wisconsin, was the first to be questioned. He was closely followed by Mr. Ruby, Mr. Hallaway, Mr. Guess and others, all of the COC post. Mr. Hallaway was requested to remain at the observation post throughout the night to note the rising of Venus and its visibility after daylight. The investigators proceeded then to Darlington, promising to return to check with Mr. Hallaway after dawn.

Mr. Clenn Winslow, policeman at Darlington, met the investigators in his patrol car and "reinstated the episode" as faithfully as his memory permitted. He was quite vague about the original sighting but much surer about the position and later motion of the object in the eastern sky. He drove the investigators to the point from which he radioed police officers in Monroe (to the east of Darlington) telling them that an object was approaching at great speed. The investigators contacted Monroe officers via the Winslow car radio and interviews were arranged for later in the morning. Mr. Winslow in particular was unable to reconcile the motion of rapid motion with the fact that he observed the object for several hours. His ability as an observer must unfortunately be given a very low rating. He appeared more intent on repeating vague statements than on attempting to be scientifically helpful.

The investigators returned to Monroe and found not only Hallaway at the observation post but about half-dozen observers. One of these, Purel Guess, local amateur astronomer, had set up his telescope and was following Venus into the daylight sky. We again checked their original sighting of position made with reference to the edge of the observing shack and found


- page 36 -

again that these agreed closely with the diurnal positions of Venus.
As we left, Gnass admitted that the object seen had most probably been
Venus.

Finally, we interrogated the city and county police officers
who had been alerted by radio call from Winslow. We were particularly
anxious to discover whether anyone had seen the object approach from the
west -- the direction of the town of Darlington. No one had. Without
exception all observers, questioned independently, pointed out sky
positions which agreed closely with those of Venus, although they were
totally unaware of this fact. Although several stated the object moved
rapidly, not one placed the object in any other position in the sky
than that occupied by Venus at the various times of observation.

The interrogations satisfied the investigators beyond all reason-
able doubt that the position of the object sighted over the total sight
hour period were also those of the planet Venus, unless therefore, one
should be willing to strain credulity and state that the mysterious
object should have by coincidence occupied the sky positions of Venus
over this relatively long period. One must conclude that the object
observed was Venus.

One striking thing, however, is revealed by this interrogation,
and that is the ease with which Venus could be seen in broad daylight.
This in itself is unusual since ordinarily Venus even when at its
brightest is difficult to pick out in the sky and is not at all easily
pointed out to a casual observer. We must conclude that the meteorolo-
gical conditions on the morning of 31 May must have been exceptional, part
ticularly with respect to freedom from haze, to which the majority of
observers attested.

What about the possibility that
it was Venus -- that the condition of the atmosphere was
just right to produce "wandering"
effect and enable it to be seen
after the sun was quite high.

If this were true, then the
Radar blip would have to be
accounted for otherwise.

Q: Did the object change
position with respect to
the sun?
This would make or break
the Venus theory.

Blue-White Light
Like Second Moon
Seen at Darlington

DARLINGTON, WIS. - (UP) -
Several persons told today how
they watched an "enormous blue-
white light like a second moon"
light up the Wisconsin country-
side near here early Sunday.

The witnesses included a sher-
iff, several policemen, a recorder
and a volunteer civil defense sky
watcher.

The unexplained object was not
seen by the astronomer at Yerkes
Observatory, near Milwaukee. To-
day, however, the Air Force said
there were no known explanations.
Air force sent jet interceptors into
the sky to investigate.

Air force spokesman at Travis
Air Force base and the Chicago filter
center would not confirm the reports.

One of the first persons to spot
the object was Policeman Glenn
Winslow. He said a full moon
was out when, at about 1:30 a.m.,
he noticed "a very bright light."

I resided the Monroe, Wis., po-
lice station 30 miles away and was
told the same thing.

The policeman awakened Louis
Groom, a United Press correspon-
dent for this area, who accompa-
nied Winslow to a hill on the
edge of Darlington. They were
joined there by Lafayette County
Sheriff Lawrence James.

All the witnesses agreed the
light was shaped like a globe-
like a balloon with an internal
blue-white light.

They sat until well past seven,
watching the object.

Dear Miss Gluck:

We have no eye-witness reports of the phenomenon observed in southwestern Wisconsin on the morning of the 31st of May, 1953. It would have seemed to be a duplication of effort for us to attempt an investigation of this sort, since the fighter squadron based at Truax Field near Madison does take care of this.

Captain John M. Fox informs me that he has made a report through Air Force channels of his investigation. He believes that it was moonlight on some scattered low-lying clouds against a background of high overcast. This jibes with what I saw about midnight here in Madison.

Very truly yours,

Darlington, Wisconsin                                                  31 May 1953

I.    DESCRIPTION

Between 0320 CST and 1130 CST on 31 May 1953, eleven persons in the Darlington-Monroe area in Wisconsin sighted an unidentified aerial object.

The object appeared as a steady white light coming generally out of the East and disappearing high overhead after 8 hours of continuous observation. It appeared low on the Eastern horizon, much brighter than the surrounding stars. It was reported to hover and then move at terrific speeds by several local inhabitants, including several county sheriffs and Ground Observer Corps members. Two of the policemen pursued the object in their squad car without gaining any noticeable ground. A telescope was employed to view the phenomena by the GOC members. The weather during the time of sighting was unusually clear with a few scattered clouds carried on a north heading by the wind.

II.   DISCUSSION

A newspaper account of the sighting came to the attention of ATIC and (Lt. Olsen) (Capt. Myers) as a result an officer and an astronomer were sent to the area of the sighting. They interrogated eight of the eleven observers in attempting to piece together the variety of reports. Estimates of azimuth and elevation readings were obtained from different observers at varied locations in Monroe and Darlington for evenly spaced time intervals during the 8 hour period. The description of the object turned out to be the same with all observers - bright white. The description of the maneuvers varied, however, some stating the object rose slowly, others saying it moved at great speeds, and then hovered. The latter description usually came from observers while riding in a car. All agreed that the object was too bright to be a star and moreover it was seen in the daytime.


- page 81 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

It was determined that the path of the object in question across the sky, its position at appearance and disappearance, very closely paralleled the path of the planet Venus on 31 May 1953. Venus on this day rose at 0310 CST and was at its approximate maximum brilliancy. Under ideal weather conditions it can be seen in the daytime, although this is rare. The fact that GOC personnel first sighted it at night and had the object pin-pointed for daylight observation allowed them to keep it under constant surveillance.

Reports that the object maneuvered radically usually came from persons driving in cars while observing the object. If Venus is stared at for any length of time without any balancing reference point, it can appear to perform erratic maneuvers.

GOC personnel alerted the Chicago Filter center and jets were scrambled to investigate. This was during daylight observation and the jets, although vectored toward the object by visual directions from Darlington, were unable to locate the unknown.

III. CONCLUSION
Was Venus.

8 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Lt. Olsson,

In connection with the sightings of 31 May in Wisconsin the following phone calls were made for additional information:

(1) To Mr. Glenn Winslow, a Darlington police officer, who reported he saw object first at 0315, overhead, moved NE, could see it move, was bright enough to light up surroundings (subjectively). He reported it on police radio and another car act after 4 hrs, presumably in a NE direction, at 75 mph but could not keep up with it. Direction of object changed to South later. Object was observed by Winslow for more than 4 hours, becoming much dimmer as daylight approached.

Overhead sighting, brightness, apparent motion, NE heading and change in direction rule out Venus.

Winslow stated that police officers in Monroe sighted the same object. Winslow familiarized with Venus, stated object was not Venus. Was asked to observe Venus before sunrise as soon as possible to double check. Also stated object almost as large as the moon.

(2) Called [redacted], an amateur astronomer in Milwaukee. Made no sighting himself but has been receiving reports. He is the head of one of Jennie's standby amateur groups. Stated he would like to have no report with a representative from Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, of the "Aerial Phenomena Research Organization", a civilian group that collects sightings.

(3) Called J.B. Sharer, Monroe GOC Observation Post. Object not reported to him until 0815. Object starlike and difficult to pick out, moving west. Was directly South at 0900. NOTE: Venus on that day was directly South at 0900. His evidence all points to Venus.

(4 & 5) Junio also called Chicago and Green Bay Filter Centers to see if anything had been called in to them.
Green Bay had no direct reports but later sent down a newspaper clipping from Darlington paper. Chicago had a sequence of reports from the Monroe Observer post (J.B. Sharer). Chicago had a radar track; on an object supposedly the same as was sighted from the ground. The radar track was evidently established at 1005.

It seems probable on the present evidence that some observers saw Venus and others definitely did not and probably saw a balloon.
