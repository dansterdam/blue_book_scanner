Report of Sighting

On 12 June 1952 at 1430, [redacted] of the Physiology Branch of the Aero Medical Lab, WAC, called to report a sighting of an unidentified aerial object. The objects were sighted for a period of one half hour between 2100 and 2130 CST from a drive-in theater located near Randolf AFB, Texas. The Capt did not know the exact location nor the directions since he was not familiar with that area. (He was there on TDY.) The objects were noticed to the right of the screen. A total of about 15 to 20 objects were observed. They were observed one at a time without more than three observations at once. They appeared to be about three times as bright as Venus, four times as fast as a F-86 and about one-twentieth the size of a full moon. They were bright bluish white in color. They were going back and forth, up and down, although most of them tended to go upward. One was noted to perform nearly a perfect sine-wave. They would suddenly come into view and suddenly disappear. They did not gradually fade out.

The weather was CAVU.
