SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

Mrs. [redacted], The Elms, Summerville, South Carolina was interviewed 4 April 1950 and she stated that on 3 April 1950 at about 1630 hours she noticed a "round saucer shaped metal object" very slowly moving about one hundred and fifty feet above her house. Mrs. [redacted] said that she was able to see the object for about three minutes. The day was bright and the sky cloudless. Mrs. [redacted] could not estimate the size of the object but she was impressed by how slowly the object was moving. Mrs. [redacted] added that the object "did not make a speck of noise." At the time Mrs. [redacted] saw the object, she was taking a stroll. She also saw a colored caretaker for the estate, who also saw the object. Mrs. [redacted] said that a neighbor, those names she did not know, also saw the object as well as several children in the neighborhood, those not near glasses. Mrs. [redacted] is seventy-seven years old and does not wear glasses.

On 4 April 1950, Mr. [redacted] in Summerville, South Carolina was interviewed and stated that he was in the drugstore across the street from Mrs. [redacted]'s home, the preceding day when about 1630 hours he noticed Mrs. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] looking up at the sky. Mr. [redacted] said that he saw the object that had attracted their attention but at the time was far off in the distance. The object was traveling in a northerly direction and it would have appeared from the direction it was going that it had been over Mrs. [redacted]'s house. From a distance, the object looked "like a piece of pipe" traveling on its horizontal axis. Mr. [redacted] said he couldn't know what the object was and that it was too far away to be able to estimate its altitude or size. The object however appeared to be traveling "pretty fast." Mr. [redacted] said that it was within his view for about two or three minutes. Mr. [redacted] is about twenty-six years old and served in the Navy Air Corps from January 1943 to April 1946. Mr. [redacted] was discharged in the rank of Aviation Radioman Second Class.
