SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

"Unidentified flying objects seen over Summerville, South Carolina on 3 April 1950."

The text describes an incident where an unidentified flying object was observed by multiple witnesses on April 3, 1950 over Summerville, South Carolina. The object was seen at around 1530 hours and was described as moving slowly about a hundred and fifty feet above a house. The witnesses, including Mrs. Bright and some children in the neighborhood, observed the object for several minutes, but could not estimate its size. The object was described as "colored caramel" in color and was said to have attracted the attention of other witnesses in the area.

The report also mentions that the witness, Mr. Summerville, was in the area at the time and noticed the object while looking up at the sky. He stated that the object was traveling in a northerly direction and appeared to be hovering. The report notes that the object's behavior was unusual, and it was traveling "pretty fast."
