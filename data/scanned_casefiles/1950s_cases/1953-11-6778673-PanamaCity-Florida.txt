At about 0615 on 19 November Mr. Assistant Fire Chief at the US Naval Air Station Corry Station, Panama City, Florida, saw in the air what appeared to be a very large, round and flat metallic object. The object approached the Station from directly NORTH, stopped over the station, and hovered. Then flew around the station and disappeared. No sound was heard. He Wells stated that he had always laughed at Flying Saucer stories, but that now he was convinced, after what he saw, that there is such a thing.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(6) Identifying information of observer:
(a) Civilian, age 31, mailing address - Andrews Station, Panama City, Florida. Occupation: Assistant Fire Chief, Tyndall AFB, reliability: very poor, since very shaky, serious about the matter, however, he was very poor at judging altitude distances.

(7) Weather and wind aloft conditions at time and place of sighting:
(a) Observer states weather was clear with scattered white clouds and there was no wind at ground level.

(b) Air Weather Service (Tyndall AFB, Florida): 0630 19 Nov 53, Report of winds aloft not available.

(c) Ceiling: scattered layer @ 12,000 feet.

(d) Visibility: 10 miles

(e) Amount of cloud cover: 0.2

(f) No thunderstorms in area.

(8) No unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise reported in area.

(9) No physical evidence of sighting available.

(10) No interception or identification action was taken.

(11) There were seventeen (17) Tyndall aircraft flying in local area at time of sighting. Local radar reports no unidentified sighting at 1230Z 19 Nov 53.

(12) Report prepared by M/Sgt. Oscar R. Lopez, MCGC, Wing Intelligence Office, Tyndall AFB, Florida. It is the opinion of the preparing MCO that since there was between (17) local aircraft airborne at time of sighting, that visibility was ten (10) miles and that upon interrogation Mr. [redacted] was very poor at altitude distances, the sighting was probably a local aircraft.
