Venus...So Bright...Causing Quite A Stir
VENUS, THE EVENING STAR, last night caused a flurry of telephone calls to the sheriff's office and The Journal Herald, because of its unusual brilliance.

ASTRONOMY

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

• THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the southwestern sky these evenings as darkness falls is not a planet, but the planet Venus, which is now at its greatest prominence, which occurs just before its disappearance from the evening sky for several weeks.

Venus is far brighter than any other star or planet seen in the night sky and there is no difficulty in identifying it. Indeed, it can be observed long before the sky is dark. In fact, if you know where to look, you can even see it in broad daylight!

After it passed behind the sun last April, Venus has gradually been drawing to the east of the sun. This means that in the evening sky, Venus will be visible in the west after the sun has set, and will remain visible in the west farther east of the sun, hence remaining in the sky for three longer time after sunset and moving toward the sun again.

Venus does not appear on the accompanying maps of the November evening sky, which show the sky at 9:00 p.m. on the 1st, 15th, and 30th, at the first of November, 9:00 p.m. on the 15th, and 9:00 p.m. on the 30th.

Bright Birds in the Sky

These maps do, however, show the stars that are now visible.

Toward the west, Deneb, at the top of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. Deneb is in the bird's tail, in fact. The word is Arabic and means "tail". The conspicuous star to the west, and the lower part of the constellation of Cygnus, is Albireo, a beautiful double star in flight. At the head is Albireo, a star of the second magnitude in the astronomical brightness scale. Below Cygnus is another first-magnitude star, Vega, in Lyra, the lyra or harp. To the right of Vega is the bright double eagle, with the star Altair.

The four stars that form the great square, part of the constellation of Pegasus, the winged horse, are now prominent. They are brightest in their characteristic arrangement rather than as a good viewing place from which to find other groups. The horse, actually, is upside down in the sky, as the square appears to be standing on one corner. In the lower right corner of the square is his head!

The star at the upper right, Alpheratz, is not in Pegasus at all, but in the neighboring constellation of Andromeda. The constellation represents the Ethiopian princess who, according to mythology, was chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea monster, represented by the constellation of Cetus, the whale.

In the sky, Alpheratz is the head of the hero, Perseus, who is seen in the northern sky.

Andromeda's mother, Cassiopeia, sits in the north, a group forming the letter W. Nearby is the constellation of Cepheus, her husband, the king. Cepheus is what is generally considered to be the finest constellation in the sky making its debut for the season.

Orion's Season's Flease

This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized by his belt. To the left is Betelgeuse, so the right is Rigel, both of the first magnitude, although being so low is the sky do not appear in bright as they will in the coming months. These will be then high in the south.

Aldebaran, the brilliant star in Taurus, and to the left of this figure stands Auriga, the charioteer with the first magnitude Capella.

Although only Venus rises in the west, Aldebaran now rises in the southeast before sunrise. Brightest of these is Jupiter, in the constellation Virgo, the Virgin. It is close to the bright star Spica.

However, it cannot be seen in the morning sky yet. Further east is Mars, rising about an hour ahead of the sun. In the brightest stars, half that of Spica, Mercury and Saturn are both too near the sun to be visible.

Shower of "Stars" to Come

November is the month bringing one of the year's famous showers of meteors, or "shooting stars," which appear from about the 13th to the 16th. They are most numerous after midnight, because then we are on the forward side of the earth in its annual movement around the sun. Thus, we meet them head on. This is different from the evening hours when we are on the rearward part, and see only those that catch up to us.

10 January 1958

20/Lt. JULIAN H GELENTER, AO 3056504
AFR 200-2, 12 August 1954

SUMMARY:

This report describes the observation of an un-identified object by Mrs and Mrs of LEESVILLE (3107N 9317W), LOUISIANA. They were both in a car driving on Louisiana Highway 112 between LECOMPTE (3105N 9220W) and FORREST HILL (3102N 9215W), LOUISIANA, and on Highway 28 between FORREST HILL and MELDER (3106N 9203W), LOUISIANA. Observations were made on the evening of 3 JANUARY 1958 commencing at approximately 1920 hours and lasting to approximately 1950 hours SIERRA time.

Both sources are college graduates and school teachers at LEESVILLE and are prominent and considered to be reputable citizens. Their husbands are successful business leaders in LEESVILLE, LOUISIANA. Sources were very cooperative in all instances and supplied their information freely with one reservation; that the interviewers use the utmost discretion in processing the information they were to give. They were interviewed separately and then it was decided to combine their information into one report.

d. Object moved gracefully with no abrupt movement in ascent or descent. Sources referred to it as "gliding" in all its movements. Object remained predominately on left side of car while the car moved in a westerly direction. At one point on Highway 28, beyond FORREST HILL traveling toward MELDER, (exact spot unknown), the object appeared to have stopped in front of the car but when the sources arrived at the spot they thought it to be, it was not there. According to Mrs. it relocated itself to the left of the car in its usual general location. (Refer to Comment #3 of the Preparing Officer).

e. The object last disappeared approximately three (3) miles EAST of MELDER, LOUISIANA, (Exact distance undetermined). It was not observed again by either source. Mrs. said the object was out of sight while traveling NORTH from FORREST HILL to Louisiana Highway 28 and then re-appeared to her left when she turned WEST on Highway 28. However, Mr. stated that the object was observed by her to the rear of the car while traveling this three (3) mile stretch of road.

b. Sources of this report were contacted separately and each was convinced that she had observed an un-identified object. It was obvious that Mrs [redacted] was more concerned and frightened by what she had observed than was Mrs [redacted] stated that she had on two (2) occasions begged Mrs [redacted] to turn around, once a few miles WEST of LECOMPTE and again a few miles out of FORREST HILL. Mrs [redacted] stated that she did not do so because she thought if the object was going to interfere with them it could do so at its option, therefore she could see no logical reason for turning around. To compensate for this Mrs [redacted] said she advanced her speed to approximately 70 MPH in order to get home as soon as possible. Mrs [redacted] stated that the interior lights of the car were off or dimmed during the entire escapade. Mrs [redacted] had her seven (7) year old girl in the back seat together with Mrs [redacted]'s one and one-half (1½) year old child. Both women stated they tried to with-hold their concern and fright from the children and thought they had succeeded.

It was determined by the interviewers that neither child had seen the object. Both sources first thought that the object was a light which they would subsequently be able to identify. However, after passing several lights and radio towers along the road they realized that their thinking had been wrong. Mrs [redacted] said that only one car passed them during the observation, it was going the opposite direction. One other car followed them a short distance but turned off the road. No other vehicles were observed by them during the observation. Mrs [redacted] has traveled this road many times on the way to BATON ROUGE.

LOUISIANA and reportedly has never made any observation of this
nature before. The car used belonged to Mrs. [redacted]. It was a
1957 CHEVROLET. It was checked for possible leads as to the cause
of the observations. It possessed no exterior or interior objects
which might account for the sightings. The road taken by the sources
during their observations was re-traveled by the preparing officer
during the same evening period in attempt to seek an explanation for
what they had observed. The only observation which could be con-
sidered related to the un-identified object was the PLANET VENUS. It
was located in the same general vicinity as the reported object and
disappeared from view at about the same time as the object reported
by the sources. VENUS was bright and gave off a glow similar to
that described by the sources. However, the movements of the object
observed by the sources cannot be explained or accounted for. Civic
officials at MELTON, FORREST HILL and LECOMPTE were contacted in
regards to observations of this nature in the past. All gave neg-
ative reports. None could give a possible explanation for the
sighting. It is believed by the preparing officer that the object
in question was the PLANET VENUS and that the imagination of the
sources along with the movement of the vehicle in which they were
traveling made it appear as if VENUS was gliding gracefully from
one side of them to the other.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER

1. The names of the sources of this report should not be disseminated
to any civilian agency without the approval of the preparing officer.

2. Every attempt was exercised to have source identify the size and shapes
of objects as outlined in AFR 200-2, but to no avail. For this reason it is
believed that neither source could make a satisfactory estimate of sizes and

distances. (See Incl # 1 and 2 for the memory sketches and area traveled by sources)

3. Sources estimated that they traveled at the speed of 60-70 MPH for approximately three (3) minutes from the spot of observation to the spot where they thought the object should have been.

4. A Major of the Army GIG located at FORT POLK, LOUISIANA spoke very highly of the sources and their families. He knew them personally and regarded them above reproach and not likely to "Cook Up" the incident outlined in this report.

5. The time lag between time of observation (3 Jan) and the date of this report (10 Jan) was due to the preparing officer not receiving a report of the incident until 8 January 1958.
