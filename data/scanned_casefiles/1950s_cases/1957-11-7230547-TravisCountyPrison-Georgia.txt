(C) SURFACE (CALM 5,000 - 337/19, 1000 - 287/25,
15000 - 287/45, 28000 - 287/53, 30000 - 287/60,
52000 - 287/55)

(C) 15,000 SCATTERED N.W. Clouds

At the first was extremely good but
cloudful the chance would
wait for 15 minutes

Probably misinterpretation of
time duration and/or speed of object

The object was not doubt
the first object reported to be in the
area at time of sighting
