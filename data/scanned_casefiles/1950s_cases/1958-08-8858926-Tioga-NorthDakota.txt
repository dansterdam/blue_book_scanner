OCR output:

NASA WASHINGTON, AUG. 25 (UPI) - ASTRONOMER J. ALLEN HYNEK TODAY TOLD NEWSMEN HIS AGENCY HAD FOUND WHAT APPEARS TO BE A "ROCKET FIRED METEORITE" IN A RURAL AREA OF NORTH DAKOTA.

HYNEK SAID THE OBJECT WAS SEEN BY AN AIR FORCE INFORMATION OFFICER-MAN AND SEVERAL CIVILIANS LAST SATURDAY NEAR TIOGA, N.D.

HE SAID THE OBJECT WAS FOUND BY THE AIR FORCE AFTER IT HAD BEEN SPOTTED FY AN ARMY MAN. IT WAS REPORTED TO BE METALLIC AND LUMINOUS WHEN FIRST SEEN, HYNEK SAID. 

AFTER IT HAS BEEN EXAMINED BY ENGINEERS, HYNEK SAID, IT WILL BE SENT TO WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE FOR FURTHER STUDY. HE SAID IT APPARENTLY LANDED IN A FIELD ABOUT 4 FEET IN DIAMETER LEAVING A SMALL CRATER.

HYNEK SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT STILL IS BEING STUDIED, AFTER PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION IT APPEARS TO BE SIMPLY A METEORITE "WHICH HAPPENED TO BE BURNING BRIGHT" WHEN SEEN. HE SAID IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SATELLITE OR SPACE VEHICLE.

HYNEK SAID THAT IN HIS OPINION THE OBJECT COULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH ANY KNOWN SATELLITE OR SPACE VEHICLE, SINCE ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOR WERE MORE TYPICAL OF A METEORITE.
