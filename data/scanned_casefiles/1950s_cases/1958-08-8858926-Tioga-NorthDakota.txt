News Release

3,195 B

WASHINGTON, AUG. 7 (UP) -- ASTRONOMERS TODAY TOLD ROCKET-AGE MOONWATCHERS EARLY TODAY TO GO BACK TO SLEEP -- THAT WAS NOT A ROCKET THEN SEEN APPARENTLY HEADED FOR THE MOON.

IT WAS THE PLANET MARS, A NAVAL OBSERVATORY SPOKESMAN S.ID. IN NEW YORK, AN ASTRONOMER FOR THE HAYDEN PLANETARIUM ALSO S.ID IT WAS THE SAME THING.

CIRCLE, MARS WAS BRIGHTER THAN IT HAS BEEN SINCE EARLY 1957.

NO-DOUBT, THE ASTRONOMICAL COMMUNITY IS SOMEWHAT EXCITED IN RELATION TO THE MOON, DURING THE NEAR FULL MOON, LAST NIGHT, A BRIGHT OBJECT WAS SEEN NEAR THE MOON. THEREAFTER, HE SAID, ITS BRIGHTNESS WOULD SLOWLY DIMINISH.

THE DETAILS WERE DISCLOSED THAT IT PLANS TO TRY TO LAUNCH THE 21 A.M. JULIAN PROBE ROCKET AT CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA.

LAST NIGHT, GROUPS OF ASTRONOMERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE PHONED BY EXCITED CITIZENS WHO HAD SEEN A BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE VICINITY OF THE MOON. SOME REPORTS SAID THE OBJECT WAS HURTLING TOWARD THE MOON.

PHONE CALLS TO OBSERVATORIES SEEMED TO DISPEL THE EXCITEMENT.

PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY, A MEMBER OF THE STAFF, DR. PHIL U. HAVAL OF THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY, SAID SHED SLIM THE OBJECT, TOO. BUT AFTER OBSERVING IT AND CONSULTING CHARTS, HE IDENTIFIED IT POSITIVELY AS THE PLANET MARS WHICH HAPPENS TO BE AT THAT ANGLE JUST NOW -- BUT MUCH FARTHER AWAY THAN THE MOON.

TOOK A LOOK (PAUSE) UNIVERSITY, ASTRONOMER OWEN MATTINGLY HE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THE BRIGHT OBJECT, BUT HE SAID IT WAS A BRIGHT STAR ON POSSIBLY A PLANET.

MATTINGLY SAID NO ROCKET FIRED FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON WOULD REMAIN VISIBLE IN SPACE FOR VERY LONG: IT

REMAIN VISIBLE IN SPACE FOR VERY LONG. IT JUST WOULDN'T BE BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE THE BRILLIANCE OF A STAR OR PLANET.

NO COMMENT WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FROM THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY, WHICH GEORGE T.U. S. AND RUSSIAN EARTH SATELLITES.

ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT AUTOMATIC 3 REPORTED THEY S--, THE OBJECT MOVING TOWARD THE MOON, MATHEMATICAL SAID THE SITUATION WAS ACTUALLY THE FRESH -- THAT IS, THE MOON WAS MOVING TOWARD MARS, FROM THE EARTH.

HOWEVER, HE EXPLAINED, THE PHENOMENON WOULD GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING.

FRANKLIN ARTHUR GAVE ACUTE INTEREST TO A RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO LAUNCH A LUNAR PROBE ROCKET AND RUSSIA'S AVOWED INTENTION OF TRYING TO SHOOT A ROCKET TO THE MOON.
