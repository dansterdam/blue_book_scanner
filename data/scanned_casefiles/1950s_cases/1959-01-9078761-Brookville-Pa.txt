BALL OF FIRE ZIPS ACROSS INDIANA SKY

A bright, flaming object described as a "ball of fire" was observed in the Indiana sky about 8:15 p.m. yesterday, Wednesday, according to reports received here from Danville, an observer town in the control tower at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

Officials at Bunker Air Force Base said some of their personnel also observed the object, making it unlikely that the sighting was merely a mirage. Further, they said, its speed was such that it appeared to be travelling at 2,000 to 3,000 miles per hour.

The image does not contain any photograph. This appears to be a handwritten report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text of the document is as follows:

THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED (FADED OUT)
WAS VISIBLY FRIGHTENED 
BY THE OBJECT AS BEING NO MORE THAN A
MILE AWAY AND APPROXIMATELY 30-40 FEET IN
DIAMETER. MY ESTIMATE IS THAT THE OBJECT WAS IN
SIGHT FOR LESS THAN 3 MINUTES. HOWEVER, IF THIS
COULD BE AN ILLUSION, I WOULD SAY THAT OWING
TO THE APPARENT SUDDENESS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE 
OF THE OBJECT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS WHOLE
INCIDENT COULD BE AN HALLUCINATION. FOR THIS TO BE
AN HALLUCINATION I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW TWO TO THREE
SECONDS AND IT WAS DISAPPEARING.

AT THE DISTANCE I HAVE ESTIMATED FOR THE OBJECT TO APPEAR OF
SUCH ACTIVITY OF SUCH IT WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50 MILES HIGH.

The image appears to contain text only and no photograph. The text describes an incident that occurred on the evening of January 9, 1959 near Brookville, Pennsylvania. It states that the incident closely resembled the Chiles-Whitted incident, where two pilots observed a UFO passing near their aircraft. The text provides details about the observed object, including its bright lighting, rapid speed, and maneuverability. It also mentions that the object was observed by ground observers who confirmed the sighting and that the incident was reported to the Harvard College Observatory.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

GALLEY 40-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
A series of recent sightings that closely resembled the Chiles-Whitted incident occurred on the evening of January 8, 1959 when two pilots of the Air Force were flying in a C-47 type of aircraft from Phillipsburg to Brookville, Pennsylvania at an altitude of 8,200 feet. The night was clear and moonlit. 
Suddenly, about 7:15 p.m., the pilots were confronted by a brilliantly lighted solid object rushing toward them. The object appeared to be a cone, shaped roughly like a teardrop and about 200 feet in diameter, emitting an intense light on its underside that could be seen for miles away. 
As the object passed the plane, it seemed to be flying silently with no apparent sound. Glowing like a small sun, it seemed to be flying toward the southwest. The pilots turned the plane in an attempt to follow the object, but it proved to be traveling at a tremendous speed, far greater than the plane, and it quickly disappeared from sight. 
The frightened pilots looked on the controls in an attempt to dodge the blast. Just before the plane could respond the unknown object zoomed out of sight. The pilots radioed their base and an official report was estimated that the object had been the size of a good oil tanker and that it had been over one-half mile in length. While the pilots were highly trained, however, they did not agree. A man with special training and unusual experience in the study of such objects as he points out, the width of the beam of a pin held at arm's length and the distance to be at least 200 miles. The extreme brilliance of the object seemed to the witnesses, he thought, but as closely observed, it seemed to be caused by an Air Force investigation of the unknown had been a fireball at least fifty miles high that had burst out and scattered as they watched.
Ground observers also saw the object, and thus provided independent confirmation of the amazing diversity reported to the Harvard College Observatory that on the night of January 8, at approximately 7:15 p.m. E.S.T., its had watched a brilliant bluish-white meteor cross the sky over Columbus and vanish within a matter of seconds. The fireball must indeed have been high and spectacular to be visible at the same moment from points under 200 miles apart.
