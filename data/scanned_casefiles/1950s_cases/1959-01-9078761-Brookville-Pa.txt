'Ball Of Fire
Zips Across
Indiana Sky'

A bright, flaming object zoomed across the central Indiana sky about 6:15 p.m. yesterday, causing viewers to light up - balloons, newscasts, boards at newspapers, radio stations, airport and police stations with anxious calls.

It was described as a dazzling ball with a short, blazing tail. Some described it as green in color.

Clarence Carr, 34 years old, Danville, an observer in the Terre Haute Municipal Airport, said he caught a glimpse of the greenish flash traveling west through the darkening sky.

He said it appeared to be a meteor or falling star. The object was sighted from throughout Indianapolis and scattered points of central Indiana.

Officials at Bunker Air Force Base said none of their aircraft were in the vicinity, making it unlikely that what was seen was a reflecting jet or a man-made object.

THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED (BURNED OUT).
WAS VISIBLY FRIGHTENED
BY THE OBJECT AND ASKED ME
WHAT IT WAS. HE ESTIMATED THE
OBJECT AS BEING NO MORE THAN A
MILE AWAY AND APPROXIMATELY
THE SIZE OF A POOL BALL
AT ARM'S LENGTH. MY ESTIMATE
IS THAT THE OBJECT WAS NO LARGER
THAN THE HEAD OF A PIN AND NO
CLOSER THAN 300 MILES. I WOULD
SAY THAT DUE TO THE APPARENT SHARPNESS
OF THE VISUAL THAT THIS OBJECT WAS HEADED
GENERALLY TOWARD US (TOWARD RATHER THAN AWAY
DUE TO AN APPARENT INCREASE IN SIZE, I REALIZE
THAT THIS TOO COULD BE AN ILLUSION CREATED
BY AN INCREASE IN BRIGHTNESS JUST PRIOR TO ITS
DISAPPEARANCE). THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT ONLY
TWO TO THREE SECONDS AND IT WAS APPROXIMATELY
5 MAGNITUDE. AT THE DISTANCE I
HAVE ESTIMATED, FOR THE OBJECT TO APPEAR AT
OUR ALTITUDE OF 8000', IT WOULD HAVE TO
BE APPROXIMATELY 50 MILES HIGH.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Calley 46—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
A more recent sighting that closely resembled the Chiles-Whitted incident occurred on the evening of January 8, 1959, and was promptly reported to ATIC [18]. Two Air Force pilots were flying in a C-45 type of aircraft from Phillipsburg to Brookville, Pennsylvania at an altitude of 8000 feet. The night was clear and moonless. At 6:14 p.m. E.S.T. they observed what appeared to be a brilliantly lighted solid object rushing toward them. Bluish green in color, shaped roughly like a teardrop and about 200 feet in diameter, it made no audible sound. Glowing like a small sun, it seemed to be flying level with the aircraft, less than a mile away and headed straight for the plane.

The frightened pilot jerked on the controls in an attempt to dodge the object, but almost before the plane could respond the unknown had disappeared. It had been in sight about three seconds. In his official report he estimated that the object had been the size of a pool ball held at arm's length and that it had been not more than a mile away. The copilot, however, did not agree. A man with special training and unusual experience in the study of UFOs, he estimated the object to be the size of the head of a pin held at arm's length and the distance to be at least 300 miles. The extreme brilliance of the object against the night sky, he thought, had made it seem larger. In his opinion, supported by Air Force investigation, the unknown had been a fireball at least fifty miles high that had burned out and vanished as they watched.

As in the Chiles-Whitted case, ground observers also saw the object and thus provided independent confirmation of the analysis. A member of the Ohio State University reported to the Harvard College Observatory that on the night of January 8, at approximately 6:15 p.m. E.S.T., he had watched a brilliant bluish-white meteor streak across the sky over Columbus and vanish within a few seconds. The fireball must indeed have been high and spectacular to be visible at the same moment from points nearly 300 miles apart.

DATE: 9 January 1959

CODE: [Blank]

The evening of 8 Jan 59 and I were returning to Wright-Patterson AFB from Washington D.C. in a C-97 type aircraft. [Redacted] was per warning as pilot and I as co-pilot. At 2314'2 while on a heading of 250° at 8000 altitude between Philipsburg and Brookville, Penn. we saw a bright object directly ahead, at apparent our same altitude and moving at great speed. The object was blue-green in color and appeared to the heading in our general direction.

Action but prior to the time that the aircraft responded appreciable...
