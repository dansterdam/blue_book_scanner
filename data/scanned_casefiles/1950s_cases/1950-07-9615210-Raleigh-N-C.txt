... AND OBSERVER, RALEIGH, N. C. MONDAY MORNING, JULY 3, 1950

Saucers Sighted
Louis Potter, local architect-
ural engineer, has night re-
ported seeing nine "flying suc-
ers" pass over Raleigh, headed
southwest at 10:20 p.m. Satur-
day, Potter said yesterday di-
rectly of the sighting, appar-
ently "glow of a high intensity,
but did not appear to be
planes with windows, as some
saucers have been described. In
the darkness, he said, he
could not estimate their alti-
tude, so could gain no idea of
their speed. They were in
"pairs" formation of three.
No noise accompanied them, he
said.

Potter said he was in front
yard of his home on North Bryan Avenue when he
saw the objects.

Sees Circular Object
Flying at 500 M.P.H.

LOS ANGELES, July 8 (AP)â€”
William Grant, twenty-six-former Marine Corps aerial photographer, today reported seeing a brilliantly lighted circular object in the sky last midnight.

He estimated the object was fifty feet in circumference and when first seen was about 1,000 feet overhead. Its speed at first was about 100 miles an hour, then increased to about 300 miles an hour before disappearing behind the Hollywood hills.

He said, "It was in sight about forty-five seconds." Mr. Grant said, "It left no exhaust trail and made no sound."

-His story was confirmed by a friend, Gilbert Magill, thirty-five, president of a concern conducting research with helicopters.
