STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

We were flying along when over the interphone came the question what was that in front of us. Our present altitude was 18,000 ft. I was flying right scanner and c couldn't see anything. The left scanner gave a report of what he saw. I left my position and looked thru the left blister and saw four gleaming balls in a straight line. The wing stopped me from seeing more of them. Then I returned to my position. That is all I saw. I had no idea of their altitude or how far from us they were. I have never seen anything like this in my life.

STATEMENT

While flying southwest of San Angelo at 2005C 19 May 1952 at 18,000 seven bright lights appeared in the west in trail.* The height and distance could not be determined. The lights appeared to be circular for about 30 minutes and then seemed to spread or trail out like a vapor trail. It appeared from the beginning as if it could have been small cloud or vapor formations with the setting sun reflecting off a lower deck cloud formation or haze layer.

They were visible until dark. As we flew along we did not seem to get closer.

I reported this to the San Angelo Radio and the operator observed this incident from the ground.

There is also a faint number at the bottom left that appears to be "142-1541", but it is quite blurry.

The rest of the document appears to be a very grainy, low-contrast black and white photographic document with significant noise/graininess that makes most potential text illegible.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Although this report was belatedly received by this headquarters, it was thought to be sufficiently important to forward for evaluation. All squadron intelligence officers and aircrewmen have been forcefully reminded of their responsibility in promptly reporting all unusual aerial observations in accordance with JAMAP and AFR 200-5.

The attached photographs prove the authenticity of the report as observed and the only explanation of the objects that can be reached at this headquarters is that possibly these units were from a vertically launched, multiple phase, rocket or guided missile. The proximity of the aircraft to the New Mexico testing sites does not rule out this possibility, but since the wind velocity at 16,000 feet was 35 knots, it seems unlikely that exhaust puffs would remain that long without dissipating.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT-CLASSIFIED

REPORT NO.
PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

While flying on a training mission on 19 May 1952 in the vicinity of San Angelo, Texas, an RB-36 crew of the 51st Strat Recon Squadron, 5th Strat Recon Wing, observed seven unidentified objects ahead of their aircraft. The RB-36 was at an altitude of 16,500 feet, approximately 159 (P) 161 NM) and the weather conditions in the area were CAVU with winds aloft of 35 knots from 310 degrees. The time of the sighting was 0948 CST, and the aircraft's position was on the 30 - 37 N 100 - 107 W heading 308 true. The seven objects appeared at a position of 11 o'clock to the aircraft at an estimated distance of 50 to 75 miles and were stationary in a vertical column. The bottom of the objects was observed to be at 25,000 feet and the top at 50,000 feet. Several conflicting reports were noted. One crew member stated the objects were in a V-formation while the time ranged from 15 to 20 minutes. The objects were lost from sight at a position approximately 30 - 53 N 100 - 20 W as 1A-6A confirmed their presence. Some time after the aircraft was flying in the direction of the setting sun. The objects were white in color and as estimate of their size could be given. One crew member described the objects as with no apparent 1120 small vapor trails. A pair of mil power binoculars were used to observe the objects, and the near confirmed the objects were a trail vapor. The pilot took a look on his scope.

The aircraft commander of the RB-36 notified the San Angelo ground station, and a ground observer from that station was also able to see the objects.

One crew member had a 3268 personal camera aboard, loaded with color film. He took six photographs at the 30 point. These were of any value. These photographs have been attached to the report forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center. The attached photographs are enlargements of the transparencies. When viewed with a 35M projector, the objects are clearly distinguishable in the transparencies.

The report of this sighting was delayed since the RB-36 crew did not report this sighting until 29 May 1952. It was added at that time to the report until the color photographs were returned from the agency that was processing them. Since then, black and white photographs had to be made. This factor also contributed to the delay.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the sighting reported was observed as stated in each of the crew member's statements, and it is definitely worthy of a flying object report.

On the 19th of May 1952, at 18,000 ft, 45 minutes out of Kelly AFB, 30 miles southwest of San Angelo, Texas, I observed seven unidentifiable glowing objects ahead, on course. We continued on course and approached them for about an hour.

On closer observation they appeared to me to be vapor trails, the highest at approximately 40,000 ft, spaced down at 1,000 ft intervals as sketched below*.

The trails were approximately one mile in length.

While returning from TDY, Kelly AFB on May 19,1952 at 2005 C.S.T. I ob-
served out of the left blister a peculiar formation of bright spots (5) under
the wing (left) at 12 o'clock. They were in a vertical line. As we came closer
the spacing between the spots became uneven and gradually left a vertical line.
They appeared as diagrammed below. Just before dusk, at the closest, I was able
to see what was causing the spots. It appeared that some aircraft had left
vapor trails in a spiral ascent or descent. The brightness of the spots ap-
peared to me to be caused by the sun's reflection from these vapor trails.

Altitude appeared to be some 15 to 20 thousand feet above our altitude of
18,000 feet.

STATEMENT    UNCLASSIFIED

On May 19, 1952 at 2005 hrs C.S.T. approximately 30 miles southwest of San Angelo, Texas, a string of seven circular lights was observed ahead of and higher than our aircraft. The sighting was reported to the A/C and everyone within view of the objects attempted to determine what they were. Upon closer observation on my part they appeared to be very small circles such as a small jet plane might make if it were flying an extremely small circle. A better description might be of a white doughnut in the sky. There were seven such objects almost one above the other. The altitude of the objects seemed to me to range from approximately 25,000 ft (the lowest) to approximately 60,000 ft (the highest). As we got closer to the objects the circular part of the objects seemed larger and fuzzier as a vapor trail might appear after it begins to dissipate. They stayed in view, still appearing ahead of us, until dark. The extreme brightness of the objects upon first sighting seemed to come from the sun which was setting. Later on the objects definitely had the fuzzy, hazy appearance of a dissipating vapor trail.

Shortly before sunset on the evening of the 19th of May 1952 we were flying at an altitude of 18,000 ft. The navigator called our attention to some objects in the air ahead of us. At first glance they looked like seven bright white lights in vertical formation. Looking at them thru 6 power binoculars they appeared to be small white clouds, as the edges could be noticed to be cloud-like in nature. The objects continued to be visible until dark (about one hour) without changing very much in size or distance although we were flying almost directly toward them for this time. They were ahead of the ship's course, slightly to the left and higher than us by about an angle of 10 to 15 degrees.

On May 19, 1952 at 2005 C.S.T. while flying southwest of San Angelo, Texas at an altitude of 18,000 feet, seven bright objects were observed in the west in a vertical formation. There appeared to be no apparent movement for the first 15 minutes, then they appeared to be sending off vapor trails in a swirling motion, different from any vapor trails I've observed from high flying aircraft.

After the vapor trails drifted off no objects were in sight. I took six pictures of this with my personal camera (35mm). The film is now being developed.

Objects in question were sighted approximately 45 minutes northwest of San Antonio. My attention was called to them and I observed them out of the left forward blister. There were seven objects about 50 to 75 miles away about 10 degrees above flight line at 11 o'clock of the aircraft. They were very white and had the appearance of having phosphorous trails, and were in a vertical line. No movement was apparent and as we drew closer I figured they must be vapor trails and so I returned to my work. This all occurred on 19 May 1952.
