Ages: 45
Occupation: Ceramic Tile Contractor
Education: 14 years
Qualifications: GCC County Supervisor for two years, nine months; served as 1/Lt with the Army during World War II.

II. RELIABILITY: Source, a pale gaunt man, was recently in an automobile accident, and did not appear to be physically robust or strong. He was completely certain that he had witnessed an object which he believed to have been looking for something. He is equally certain that the object with reference to Incl 1 was able to give more complete description of the object (refer to Incl 1) and was able to give more complete description of it than any of the other descriptions. His reliability is considered to be "B".

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was at his home with his wife when they were notified by the Kalispell GCD Observer that an unusual object was visible in the south-southeastern sky. This was approximately at 0405153 Sep 56(2215 hours), 3 Sep 56. Source and his wife compared out on their back porch and instantly spotted a brilliant light at an angle of approximately 70 degrees above the horizon.

2. The night was cold, dry, and with very gusty winds. There was no moon, but many stars were visible, despite scattered clouds.

3. Source stated that he could clearly distinguish the shape of the objects he described as a bowl shaped, with five "fingers" or rays of light protruding from the light. The object was approximately the diameter of the object, and glowed brilliantly, changing color with the object, sometimes white, a yellow, a red. At times a tail was attached to the other end, but this tail, Source stated, was green.

4. Source stated that the brilliance of the object varied constantly, as though it were controlled by a rheostrat. At times it would be intensely brilliant, and then dim as though the voltage were being reduced. There was no time pattern for this change in intensity, the change would occur in a matter of a few seconds.

5. Source is being like a cloud, very close, and which he compared to the nearest visible cloud and the cloud were related, and that at times the object would disappear within the cloud.

6. The object moved erratically and with great speed. Source compared its movement to a yoyo. Although he said that it also moved horizontally as well as vertically. The object at all times moved directly against the prevailing winds, which were predominantly from the east.

7. Both Source and his wife observed the object and the cloud through low power binoculars, but stated that clarity with which it could be observed. (Source did not wear spectacles during the interval.)

8. Source was reluctant to estimate the size of the object, but later compared it to the size of a dime held at arm length. The estimated the object to be from six to eight miles distant.

9. Source and his wife continued to observe the object from their back porch throughout the night. Source could see the object in a south-southwesterly direction by comparing its relative position from points along the ridge pole of a neighboring house.

10. No sounds were heard at any time.

11. Source was asked if he had any ideas as to what the object might be, or what it would be doing in that area. He replied in the negative, but added that it might be looking for a landing area in a remote portion of the U.S. None was then such a place.

12. The object disappeared suddenly as dusk was approaching, and seemed to disappear in the southwestern area.

I.  SOURCE: Bater (Mrs.)
    Address: [Street name illegible], Street, Kalispell, Montana
    Age: 49
    Occupation: Housewife
    Education: 14 years
    Qualifications: COO post supervisor, Kalispell, Montana; has been with COO for two years and nine months; served during World War II in the WAC, with rank of corporal.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was a vigorous, alert woman, eager to volunteer all the information at her disposal. She spoke with authority, and was over hesitant to assert any questions. When her impressions were put to her husband (Refer to Part One, this report) she so stated. Source is an energetic woman in her mid-50's and is fully aware of the importance of the investigation. The investigators have the opinion that Source is inclined to magnify certain details; however, her reliability is considered to be "C".

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
    1. Source was at her home when she was notified by the Kalispell COO observation post that an unusual object was visible. In the northwestern sky. This was approximately at 0405152 Sep 56 (2215 hours MST, 3 Sep 56). Standing on her back porch, Source initially saw a brilliant light at an angle of approximately 70 degrees above the horizon.

    2. The night was cold, dry, and with very gusty winds. There was no moon, but many stars were visible, despite scattered clouds.

    3. The object was, according to Source, tear shaped, and at least two inches growing. In diameter, the full moon is 10 full inches. In color it changed at varied intervals from white to yellow.

    4. Source stated that she had frequently observed the planet Venus when she was stationed in the South Pacific, and that this object was infinitely brighter than any other planet when observed. She was emphatic that it was not a planet. Source stated that the brilliance of the object changed rapidly, fading from a very bright glow.

    5. Source stated that the object was accompanied by a cloud, which she was convinced had some connection to the vapor. She described it as the cloud was within the same area arising from dry ice. She frequently saw the object disappear within this vapor.

6. The object moved erratically and made sharply angled turns; the distance the object moved during one of these turns was estimated to be ten times the diameter of the object.

7. Source estimated the height of the object to be between 6,000 and 10,000 feet. This estimate was based on information she received from the U.S. Weather Bureau, Flathead County Airport.

8. Source stated that the object was observed through low-powered binoculars. Some commentary was possible.

9. Source estimated to observe the object during the rest of the night, watching a slow progression in a south-southwesterly direction, until it disappeared near dawn at 0(3)73 Sep 56(347 hours, EST, A Sep 36).

10. No sounds were heard, although Source stated that when she first began her observation, she thought the distant highway traffic. 

11. Source stated that he had never before encountered anything like this, she had no idea to the identity of the object.

II. RELIABILITY: Despite a lack of formal education, Source impressed the investigators as being distinctly above average intelligence and ability. Friendly and courteous, he carefully weighed the answers to all questions, considering them thoroughly before giving a reply. He gave the impression that although he knew that sightings of such objects should be reported, he was a little uncomfortable and self-conscious that he may have happened to him. He may be considered to be completely reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
1. Source was in his residence when the COG Post Supervisor telephoned him at approximately 0035327 Sep 56 (2050 hours MST, 3 Sep 56) and informed him that an unusual object was clearly visible in the south-southeastern sky and inquired his opinion as to its identity.

2. Source stated that on stepping outside his house, he immediately observed a brilliant glow in the sky, in a south-southeasterly direction, and at an angle of approximately 75 degrees from the horizon.

3. The night was cold, dry, and with very gusty winds. There was no moon, but many stars were visible, despite scattered clouds.

4. Source, who was spectacles during the interview, observed the object through a pair of binoculars (power unknown) but could detect no shape or details. He stated that the object seemed to have no shape at all, but later decided that the trailing edge was very slightly more convex than the leading edge.

5. The object was red, but later appeared to turn to white. This change in color continued during the periods of his observations. The object would disappear at varied intervals, and then reappear. During the intervals of disappearance, Source stated the sheen of it was visible through the clouds.

6. Source declined to estimate the size of the objects, stating frankly that he could not do so. He stated that he could not determine its shape, but it was similar to a brilliant light, and that it seemed intermittently.

7. Source did not see the object move, although at one time after he had returned inside the house, the object seemed to have moved to the right, or to the south.

8. No sounds were heard at any time.

9. Source would not theorize as to the possible identity of the object, but he was certain it was not a planet. He apologized for not being able to describe it more accurately or completely.

     Education:  High School
     Length of Service:  Eleven months with CGC

II.  RELIABILITY:  Source, a very pleasant, affable and conscientious non-commissioned officer, was friendly and eager to be of assistance he could offer.  He impressed the Investigator as being a man of excellent common sense and above average intelligence.  He was very serious and concerned about the object sighted, and self-conscious about his inability to explain it.  Source is considered to be usually reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS:

     1.  Source was notified at approximately 040530Z Sep 56 (2230 hours MST 3 Sep 56) that a brilliant object had been reported south-southeast of Kalispell, by the local GOC Post Supervisor (Refer to Parts One and Two, this report) until approximately 041200Z Sep 56, a time span of seven and one quarter hours.

     2.  Source, observing through low-powered binoculars, described it as a brilliant light operated with a rheostat; it would increase in brilliance until full intensity was attained, and would then dim down to a dull glow within three or four seconds.

     3.  The night was pitch dark but with many stars visible, and the object appeared to be brighter than the background of the sky.  There were gusty winds; the night was cloudy.  There were some scattered clouds.

     4.  Source stated that the object was constantly moving in an erratic manner, and progressing slowly in a southwest direction.  He estimated it to be approximately 35 degrees from the horizon, and that the object seemed to be dedging in and out of a misty cloud.  At times, the object was completely hidden by this misty cloud.  At times, the object appeared first and then another time was clearly outlined.  (Refer to Incl 1 for memory sketch by Source).  In his own words, Source stated that it looked to him like "half grapefruit with Oldsmobile rocket emblem behind it so that the point of the rocket was ahead of the grapefruit," and the tail line to the rear of the grapefruit.

5. Source estimated the size of the object to be comparable to a dime held at arm's length. The colors varied from red to green to white. No sound was noted at any time.

6. At approximately 041300Z Sep 56, Source was a passenger in an L-20 type aircraft which flew a circle of about 200 miles in the area. Nothing unusual was observed during the flight.

7. Source stated that he had never previously observed anything similar to this object, and has no theory as to the identity.

    Station: GOC, Helena, Montana (EXER 5936)

II. RELIABILITY: Source was on a three-day pass from his duty station in Helena, Montana, visiting with the NCOIC of the GOC in Kalispell, Montana when he observed this object. He was completely cooperative and since he could render assistance he could render. Source was convinced that he had seen something unusual, but was self-conscious about being involved. And particular several times in the investigators thought he was "nuts". He appeared to be somewhat shy about answering questions, but was definite when he did answer. Source is considered to be usually reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. Source first observed an unusually brilliant object in the southeastern sky approximately 0310Q (25 Sep 56) in the vicinity of Kalispell, Montana. He continued to observe it for an hour and a half, until it disappeared around dawn, when it seemed to rapidly descend.

2. The night was pitch dark but with many stars visible, and the winds were very easy. The weather was dry and cold.

3. Source stated the object glowed with a brilliant radiance, which seemed to pulsate at irregular intervals. He described its color as being a bright golden hue, and that it appeared to have a sharp clear outline except for a fuzzy and hazy tail. He observed its length as that of an automobile headlight approximately one block away.

4. Source stated the object appeared to be something metallic, and said it was completely stationary in the sky and held its length.

5. Source was certain that there was no cloud connected with this object. He never observed any several clouds in the vicinity of the object, nor did the object appear to be obscured by clouds.

25,000         300                     75

Ceiling and Cloud Cover:
C306002 Sep 56                         6,000 Feet, scattered
C309002 Sep 56                         25,000 Feet, scattered cirrus

Visibility:
Kalispell: 10-15 miles throughout the night
Surrounding stations: 30-50 miles throughout the night

Three-hour reports at C306002 Sep 56 and C309002 indicated the presence of F-84 aircraft at the following stations:

Geiger AFB (BMG 2337)
Ephrata, Airway (BMG 3033)
Butte, Montana (BMG 300)
Havre, Montana (BMG 283)
Livingston, Montana (BMG 2640)
Milies, Idaho (BMG 1988)

2. F360 type aircraft maneuvered at both Malmstrom AFB and Geiger AFB reported no radar or visual contact with the object.

3. Reference material available to this flight indicates that the planet Mars is closer to the earth than it has been since 1924, and will in consequence be of increased visibility.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was caused by the planet Mars for the following reasons:

    a. On 7 September 1956, the planet Mars will be closer to the earth than it has since 1924; it is particularly brilliant in the evening sky even now.

    b. Sunset at 0402037 Sep 56 (1903 hours MST 3 Sep 56); sunrise at 0402475 Sep 56 (0547 hours MST 4 Sep 56). These hours are consonant with the sightings of the object.

    c. The position of the planet Mars is consistent with that reported in the sightings.

    d. Although all Sources reported the object as having appreciably larger size than other stars or planets, it believes this can be engendered, possibly induced by their excitement and eagerness to be of service to GOC.

    e. Prolonged observation of any star or planet through a pair of hand-held binoculars will give the impression of erratic movement.

    f. All Sources had thoroughly discussed the object among themselves prior to being interviewed and had completely compared their impressions and opinions; these impressions, although different in minor aspects, are basically the same.

    g. It is significant and indicative of the poor of observation of Sources that he reported the wind as being from the earth, this is not consistent with the weather forecast at Malmstrom AFB.

    h. No other hypothesis of UFO's meets identification criteria.

September 3, 1956.--Montana.-- An unexplained UFO, described by separate witnesses as a shining triangle and an orange bell hovered in the sky near Kalispell, Montana. It finally disappeared in a westerly direction.

Air Force and civilian officials viewed the object and were not able to explain it away as a natural phenomenon.

It was first sighted at 10 p.m. and disappeared at 5:30 a.m.

At times during the night the object became brighter and dimmer. Once in a while it faded out of sight entirely always to return into view.

At no time was the object picked up on radar.

Case 209, Kalispell Mont. Sept. 3 and 4, 1956.--A UP report told of a "shining triangle" surrounded by a yellow glow which hovered in the sky throughout the night. It disappeared Wednesday early Tuesday. Said the report, five jet interceptors from Malmstrom AFB were scrambled in an attempt to sight the object, but were thwarted by low clouds. Air Force and civilian officials viewed the object, but were unable to explain it away as a natural phenomenon.--Ed: Mars is suspected, but certainly the AF and at least one of the civilian officials should be able to recognize Mars, and jet do not scramble a chase a planet 35 million miles away. According to the Great Falls Tribune, which contradicts the UP accounts, the object was seen in the sky southwest of Kalispell ... then it faded from view.

1956, Sept. 4--Montana -- triangle-shaped UFO & an orange ball-of-light seen by hundreds. Air Jets couldn't locate them or get them on Radar... (continued off. Radio)
