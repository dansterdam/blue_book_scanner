Here is the text from the document:

COPY
Friday 10-8-54 - 1930

At the time and date mentioned above, while I was digging a water line trench, with my wife for company, we spotted an object racing through the sky. My wife spotted it first and yelled for me to look. At first sight, I thought it to be a meteor but it traveled in a true horizontal plane with no arc whatsoever.

It was ovular in shape and in comparison to conventional aircraft it appeared to be about 75 ft in length, and was lined with a very brilliant halo of blue-violet flame. The color was spectacular. It trailed a stream of fire or flame about 6 times the length of the object with occasional bursts of white fire. It had a high, barely audible sound similar to a sound produced by a ricochets.

I estimated the height at between 800-1000 feet. I can not estimate the speed but I watched it for a distance of about 4 miles and at last sight it was well within the station limits. The whole incident took perhaps 3-5 seconds. The speed of the object was terrific. I have watched jets in the daytime at altitudes of 1000 feet, but the speed far exceeded that of a jet and what sound was audible was incomparable to that produced by a jet.

The object was headed in a NE by E direction straight and true.
