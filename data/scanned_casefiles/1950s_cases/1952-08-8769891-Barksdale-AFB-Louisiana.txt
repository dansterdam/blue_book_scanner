IR-127-52
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana
DATE: 8 August 1952  
PLACE: Barksdale AFB, Louisiana

On 8 August 1952, between 2010 and 2115 hours, visual sightings of unidentified flying objects were reported to the 2nd Air Division Control Center at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. The objects were observed in the general area of the airbase by approximately 12 officers and airmen. The observers stated that the objects gave the appearance of intense white lights which appeared to be solid and circular in shape. The objects were reported to have been seen at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet and to have been moving at a speed estimated to be in excess of 500 mph. On several occasions the objects were reported to have made abrupt stops and changes in direction. No sound was reported to have been associated with the objects. Radar equipment at Barksdale AFB was unable to track the objects. There are no known aircraft capable of the maneuvers reported to have been observed. The sightings were reported to have lasted approximately 15 to 30 minutes.
