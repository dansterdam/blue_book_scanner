10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Observer noted a sudden streak of vapor trail across sky moving generally from SW to NE. Object could not be seen. Observer thought he saw a brief reflection on the object, however, no shape or size could be ascertained. Object was continuing, while in color, a thin definite horizontal axis noted when first sighted. Vapor trail widened as strong dispersed by the wind. After the object passed from sight, no associated with the object and the fact that the object could not be seen indicates the flight path was at an extreme altitude.

11. COMMENTS
Probable vapor trail from a/c, since weather condition indicate trail forming below 45,000. Also trail was white and indicated more that no dispersion was noted.

☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possible Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft

At the object was reported to have moved across the width of the object vapor trail made a slight well toward the west. [Additional text partially illegible]

4. Weather conditions in the area of the sighting at that time were as follows:
   a. Clouds, 3000 feet, scattered, 16,700 feet, scattered. 16,000
   feet broken, 20,000 feet, at 12,000 feet a 3/10 - 4/10, 25,000
   feet - 2/10 - 6/10 west, 27,000 feet - 6/10 - 8/10 west, 30,000
   70 miles, 35,000 - 6000 feet - 8/10 west, 16,000 feet - 2/10 - 35 knots.

5. No sound could be associated with the object, and the fact that the object was first sighted well above the flight path was at an extreme altitude. The presence of vapor trail was probably under 15,000 feet.
