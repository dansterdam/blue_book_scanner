a follow-up, field investigation of a UFOR report. These criteria will cover, among others, the following subjects:

(1) Duration of sighting.
(2) Number of persons reporting the sighting.
(3) Distance from location of sighting to nearest 4602d AISS field unit.
(4) Reliability of person or persons reporting the sighting.
(5) Number of independent sightings reported.
(6) The value of obtaining additional information immediately.
(7) Existence of physical evidence (photographs, material, hardware).

b. It was noted that a single extraordinary circumstance might require follow-up, field investigation even though the general application of the criteria furnished by ATIC indicates that further investigation would probably yield little additional information.

c. In general follow-up field investigation of a preliminary UFOR report will not be warranted when the hypothesis suggested by the preliminary report of the incident cannot be tested by facilities available.

4. Exhaustion of Effort in the Investigation of UFO's: Effort will be considered as exhaustive when every logical, physical hypothesis suggested by a qualified report of the incident has been tested by the facilities available.

a. Qualified preliminary reports shall be considered to be those which merit further investigation under the criteria set forth in paragraph 3 above.

5. Unsolved Cases: A case shall be considered unsolved after every suggested hypothesis has been tested by available facilities and a large percentage of the data in the report does not correlate with the characteristics of known objects or natural phenomena.

Hq, 4602d AISS, Ent AFB, Colorado Springs, Colo. subj: Report of Visit of ATIC Representative

6. The following procedures were agreed upon:

a. In case a UFOB sighting is reported initially by non-Air Force sources in letter form to either ATIC or the 4602d AISS, the file card will be made in duplicate by the recipient, and one copy forwarded to the other agency. This card will indicate that the UFOB was reported by letter and will show the action taken.

b. ATIC will be forwarded a file card indicating the action taken by the 4602d AISS on preliminary reports transmitted to the 4602d by electrical means.

c. The results of follow-up field investigations made by the 4602d AISS and reported on AF Form 112 will, in all cases, be sent to ATIC, D/I USAF, and such other agencies as the Commander, 4602d AISS, deems necessary.

d. ATIC may require specific information for aid in analyzing a reported UFOB sighting which can be furnished by a field unit of the 4602d AISS. Provided travel is not involved, ATIC may contact the appropriate unit directly. In case ATIC desires detailed investigation or action which would necessitate travel, request will be made by ATIC to the Commander, 4602d AISS.

e. File cards reflecting action taken or conclusions reached by ATIC on either a preliminary or follow-up UFOB report will be sent to Commander 4602d AISS under the following circumstances:
(1) When conclusions of ATIC relative to identification of the sighting are at variance with those reached by 4602d AISS,
(2) When additional action is initiated by ATIC following the completion of action by the 4602d AISS.

7. Exchange of Information: As a result of the ATIC experience in the field of investigation of UFOB reports, information of a general interest was discussed during the visit of ATIC representatives and will be furnished to the 4602d AISS on a continuing basis. Examples of such information follow:

a. Grid cameras. Information relative to the present distribution of grid cameras and changes in the current distribution.

b. Statistics. Consolidation of statistics reflecting trends.

SUBJECT: Report of Visit of ATIC Representatives

TO: Commander
    Air Technical Intelligence Center
    ATTN: ATIAC-5
    Wright Patterson Air Force Base
    Dayton, Ohio

1. On 17 and 18 November 1954, the Commander, 4602d AISS and his staff met with Captain Charles Hardin, ATIC, and Doctor Allen Hynek, USAF Contract Astronomer, for the purpose of discussing ATIC-4602d AISS relationships in the investigation and processing of Unidentified Flying Objects reports. During the course of the conference general information was exchanged relative to the UFOB program, procedures were developed relative to the handling of UFOB reports and the criteria for evaluation of reports and conducting investigations were discussed.

2. The evaluation of all UFOB reports as well as the lines of inquiry of investigations, will be governed by the application of certain hypotheses to the data available. In the majority of cases, provided the information concerning the sighting is sufficiently complete, the data will suggest that the sighting was probably some known object or natural phenomena. For example, the data available might suggest to the investigator the hypothesis that the sighting was an aircraft. A check list will then be applied to the data using the hypothesis that the sighting was an aircraft. The check list will contain those items which, in combination, characterize aircraft from other possible objects or phenomena. For example, if the object was an aircraft, then there should have been noise, there should have been radar observation in certain areas, etc. The application of these check lists will suggest the lines of follow-up investigation in the event the data is insufficient to satisfy the elements of proof necessary to identification. ATIC will furnish the 4602d AISS with the check lists referred to above which will assist in the identification of UFOBs, and will cover, for example, aircraft, balloons, astronomical phenomena, guided missiles, etc. In addition a special evaluation of preliminary UFOB reports must be made to determine whether follow-up investigations can reasonably be expected to result in additional reliable and usable data.

3. Evaluation of Preliminary Reports:
    a. ATIC will furnish the 4602d AISS with "rule of thumb" criteria to be used by the Squadron Headquarters in determining the necessity for

a follow-up, field investigation of a UFOB report. These criteria will cover, among others, the following subjects:

(1) Duration of sighting.
(2) Number of persons reporting the sighting.
(3) Distance from location of sighting to nearest 4602d AISS field unit.
(4) Reliability of person or persons reporting the sighting.

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY ATIC-ADC

AGREEMENT:
An agreement was concluded in December 1953 between the Air Technical Intelligence Center and Air Defense Command whereby, in the future, the 4608th Air Intelligence Service Squadron will process and make on-the-spot investigations on all initial UFO reports originating in the ZI. The 4608th AISS is a definite intelligence activity which is widespread in the field. In some cases, ATIC ATIC will join ADC in field investigations.

UNKNOWNS:
At the conclusion of investigations by 4608th AISS, Air Defense Command will furnish information to ATIC on all closed (identified) cases and will forward all material and reports of investigations on the cases which remain as unknowns.

FINAL ANALYSIS:
The ATIC retains the responsibility for final analysis of these unknowns originating in the ZI, together with all cases from overseas.

AIR FORCE REGULATION 200-2 (NEW):
This program will be formally initiated with the publication of a new AFR 200-2 which is forthcoming.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-4E4

SUBJECT: UFO Program

TO: AFCIN-4 (Colonel John G. Eriksen)
THRU: AFCIN-4E

1. The Problem Area

a. All of the problems associated with the Air Force's UFO Program seem centered around the "reaction capability" (reporting and investigation). There is a need to increase the speed of processing reports and of initiating investigations and to improve the quality of both.

2. Discussion

a. The 1006th AISS which, outside of the ATIC, is probably the most logical and qualified organization to perform the investigation function is approximately 33% under T/O strength. The squadron is presently undergoing reorganization in order to perform a new mission of such high priority that reorganization is being given to deleting the mission for which the 1006th was originally organized from the new charter. The UFO investigation mission was not included in the original charter and there are no plans to include it in the new one.

b. In order to carry out this new mission, it will be necessary to have more than 50% of the squadron personnel physically located at the squadron headquarters at Ft. Belvoir, Va. There are no plans to reduce the number of detachments below the present ten, but to reduce the number of officers and airmen assigned by approximately 50%, therefore limiting still further the personnel available for field investigations.

c. Colonel Golforth of AFCIN-1A1 informed Major Friend of AFCIN-4E4 that if ATIC would provide the personnel the 1006th AISS would be happy to house, feed, and administer them in support of the UFO Program.

SUBJECT: Briefing of ADC Forces and Divisions on Project Blue Book (Uncl)

TO: Commanding General
Air Defense Command
ATTN: LCY/E
Ent Air Force Base
Colorado Springs, Colorado

1. During a visit to Headquarters Air Defense Command on 16 October 1953, Capt Edward w. Ruppelt of ATIC discussed with Col Burgess the feasibility of briefing all air defense forces and divisions on project Blue Book. Since this visit the subject has been given more study, and it is believed that such a series of briefings would be highly advantageous. Similar briefings have been given to various air force units and have resulted in a better understanding of the objectives and operations of the project and in more efficient, accurate reporting. By presenting such briefing, many insignificant, nebulous reports can be eliminated while the significant pre-work will be more complete and contain more usable data.

2. The proposed plan for the briefings would be first to present the briefing to HQ, ADC. If this is desired. A tour would then be made through each Air defense force area, briefing first the ADC forces then each separate Air division. At the division level, selected personnel from each unit subordinate to the division (i.e. ADC Squadrons, Fighter Interceptor Squadrons, etc.) would be called in for the briefing. If the division is a tenant organization on the base, persons other than ADC personnel with an official interest could be chosen by the division Commander and invited to attend. The number of people to be briefed would be limited only by the available space and security. The classification of the briefing will be Secret. The briefing in general will consist of:

a. A brief history of project Blue Book.
b. The philosophy of the project.
c. Methods of quickly gathering data using available facilities at an air base.
d. How a preliminary analysis of reports can be made in the field.
e. Preparation of a report for forwarding to ATIC and HQ USAF.
f. How ATIC processes FLOB-NUTS.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(1) Change AFR 200-2 to spell out in detail the responsibilities of the base commanders and other organization commanders, and expand information required in initial report as spelled out in AFR 200-2. (Copy of 0-86 which has been sent to AFCIN-Xl requesting these changes is Atch Nr. 2)

(2) AFR 200-2 be made a "special subject regulation" of air inspectors for a period of one year.

b. Investigations (See Atch Nr. 1)

(1) The 1006th AISS be made primarily responsible for conducting UFO investigations and this function be included in the organization's charter.

(2) The T/O of the 1006th AISS be expanded to man the squadron sufficiently to undertake UFO investigation in addition to its other missions. It is desirable that the strength of each detachment be increased by two, one commissioned officer and one airman.

(3) One individual in each detachment of the 1006th AISS, a commissioned officer preferred, be given special training and made specifically responsible for UFO investigation.

c. Training (See Atch Nr. 3)

(1) The ATIC to establish and present the training course for the individuals selected at each detachment as being responsible for the UFO investigation mission.

4. Suggested Actions

a. The memorandum to M/General Watson, Subject: "UFO Program" and its attachment (Atch Nr. 1) be approved and forwarded.

b. Approval of the letter (Atch Nr. 3) to AFCIN-4X4 establishing requirement for a training program, pending AFCIN approval of the 1006th AISS as primarily responsible for UFO investigations.

UFO Program

ACS/1 (Major General Harold E. Watson)

1. As you know, this Center is responsible for performing a complete analysis and evaluation of all UFO reports in accordance with the provisions of AFR 200-2, dated 5 Feb 58. This analysis and evaluation, of necessity, can be no better than the reported information with which we must work. It has been determined at this Center that the problems associated with this program are centered around the Air Force's "reaction capability" (reporting and investigation). There is a need to increase the speed of processing reports and of initiating investigations and to improve the quality of both.

2. The reporting problem for the most part can be corrected by changes to AFR 200-2. These changes will effectively spell out in detail the responsibilities of the base commanders and other organization commanders, and expand on the information required in the initial report. It is also contemplated making AFR 200-2 a "special subject regulation" of air inspectors for a period of one year following the effective date of these changes.

3. AFR 200-2 presently spells out the nearest Air Force base commander as responsible for the investigation of UFO's. As has already been pointed out this has proved unsatisfactory. The 1006th AISS, due to its geographical deployment is the most logical organization to perform the investigative function. It is suggested that AF CIN[?]-1 be instructed to include the investigation of UFO sightings in the new charter for the 1006th AISS.

4. The ATIC will make provisions to give special training to at least one individual from each detachment, preferably a commissioned officer, who will then become primarily responsible for UFO investigations.


- page 14 -

5. If responsibility for UFO investigation is delegated to the 1006th AISS, it will require certain changes to AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 1958, to make this directive compatible. Attachment Nr. 1, Subj: "AFR 200-2 (Unidentified Flying Object)" is a draft of correspondence to AFCIN-XI outlining the required changes.

6. It is suggested that the attached letter be forwarded to AFCIN-XI for implementation.

1. The following changes and additions to AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 1959, are suggested in an effort to improve the Air Force's reaction capability as it applies to the UFO program.

    a. Par. 3b. Technical and scientific, changed to read as follows: The Air Force will continue to collect and analyze reports of UFO until all can be scientifically or technically explained or until such time as it is determined that the full potential of a sighting has been exploited. In performance of this task the following factors should be kept in mind: (a) through (d), will remain unchanged.

    b. The word "unknown" as it applies to an unidentified object should be changed to "unidentified" throughout the regulation.

    c. Par. 4a. The following should be added to this paragraph: Investigators will be authorized to make telephone calls directly to the ATC (AFOIG/hg, Ext. 6916) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio from the investigation area. The purpose of these calls to report high priority findings.

    d. Par. 5a. The following should be added to this paragraph: When reporting that a witness is completely familiar with certain aspects of a sighting, his or her specific qualifications should be indicated.

    e. The following should be added as Par. 5j: whenever possible, an individual...


- page 16 -

dual selected as a UFO sighting investigator should have a scientific
or technical background as well as experience as an investigator.

f. Par. 6a. Should be changed to read as follows: All Air
Force activities will conduct UFO investigations to the extent necessary
for their required reporting action (see Pars. 15, 16 and 17). However,
investigations should not be carried beyond this point, unless such
action is directed by Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, headquarters, United States Air Force, or if in the opinion of the preparing
officer the magnitude (intelligence significance or public relations)
of the case is such to warrant full scale investigation. Telephone
contact should be made with the ATIC (available Ext. 6916) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This to obtain verbal authority, for continued
investigation. This should be so noted in the preliminary report
(foreign activities will proceed on their own judgment and so advise
the ATIC in the preliminary message.

g. Eliminate all reference to the Ground Observers Corps
from the regulation.

h. The following should be added as Par. 15(7). Temperature Gradient.

i. Par. 15j should be changed to read as follows: location,
approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic
or balloon releases in the area which could possibly account for the
sighting.

j. Par. 15k should be changed to read as follows: position
title, name, telephone number and comments of the preparing officer,
including his preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting(s).

k. Par. 15. Reporting Physical Evidence. The following should
be added to this paragraph: All physical evidence forwarded to the
ATIC should be marked for the attention of ACIN-4h4.

1. PURPOSE: This publication is designed for the use of
Ground Observer Corps personnel, and is published to familiarize
observers with common phenomena which are sometimes misinterpreted as
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOB's).

2. DEFINITIONS:

a. Unidentified Flying Object (UFOB)-- Relates to any
airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or
unusual features does not conform to any presently known aircraft or
missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar
object.

b. Familiar Objects-- Include balloons, astronomical bodies,
birds, etc.

3. OBJECTIVE: Due to the prolonged observation of the sky during
both daylight and night time hours, familiar objects such as meteors,
aircraft, balloons, astronomical bodies, searchlights, birds, etc., will
be frequently observed by GOC personnel. Due to atmospheric conditions
(temperature inversions, dust, clouds, etc.), reflections, sound (or

3. An attempt would be made to cover one Air Defense Corps area per trip necessitating three trips at the rate of one trip per month starting in December 1953.

4. The Air Technical Intelligence Center requests your approval and/or comments concerning this proposed briefing at Air Defense Forces and Divisions.


- page 23 -

3. OBJECTIVE (Contd.):
lack of sound), speed, position, etc., common phenomena may sometimes be
misinterpreted as UFOBs. It is highly desirable that all UFO phenomena
be identified or explained. In this respect, the observer requires some
"rule-of-thumb" to assist him in this identification.
The object of this publication is to familiarize the Ground
Observer with the appearance(s) of common objects under one or more of
the circumstances listed above.
4. GUIDANCE: Attached is a list of common phenomena to which
Ground Observers may be exposed during their tours of duty. It is
recommended that you become thoroughly familiar with these criteria, as
they may enable you to identify objects with a greater degree of accuracy.

BALLOONS

1. Shape: Round, cigar, pinpoint, or bowling pin.

2. Size: Balloons up to a hundred feet will generally appear from pinpoint to size of a pea held at armlength.

3. Color: Silver, white or many tints. It may possibly appear dark as when projected against the clouds. Sometimes transparent.

4. Speed: Large scale erratic speed ruled out. In general hovering to slow apparent speed.

5. Formation: Single to cluster.

6. Trail: None.

7. Sound: None.

8. Course: Straight with a general gradual ascent, unless falling.

9. Time in Sight: Generally long. Note: Balloon may suddenly burst and disappear.

10. Lighting Conditions: Night or day but especially at sunset or sunrise.

Wind Effect: Balloons move with the speed and direction of the prevailing wind in the area and altitude. If balloons are to be in vicinity without reasonable doubt, compared generally with the direction and speed of the UFO reported, then the probability that the object was a balloon is high.


- page 25 -

AIRCRAFT

1. Shape: From conventional to circular or elliptical.

2. Size: Pinpoint to actual.

3. Color: Silver to bright yellow (night - black or color of lights).
Jet exhaust yellow to red. Under certain conditions
aircraft too far distant to be visible to the naked eye,
will reflect sunlight from wings or fuselage.

4. Speed: Generally only angular speeds can be observed. This depends
on distance but small objects crossing major portion of sky
in less than a minute can be ruled out. Aircraft will not
cross major portion of sky in less than a minute whereas
a meteor certainly will.

5. Formation: Two to twenty. Numbers greater than 20 more likely
birds than aircraft.

6. Trails: May or may not have (vapor and exhaust).

7. Sound: Zero to loud shrill or low depending on altitude and
winds aloft. Under certain conditions, aircraft may be
observed at high altitudes, without making any sound.

8. Course: Steady, straight or gently curving (not erratic - may
appear still if approaching head-on). Right angle turns
and sudden reversals, abrupt changes in altitude ruled out.

9. Time in Sight: More than 15 seconds, generally of the order of a
minute or two.

10. Lighting Conditions: Night or Day.


- page 26 -

METEOR

1. Shape: Round to elongated.

2. Size: Pinpoint to size of moon.

3. Color: Flaming yellow with red, green or blue possible.

4. Speed: Crosses large portion of sky in few seconds except if coming head-on.

5. Formation: Generally single - can break into shower at end of trajectory. Occasionally (but rare) small groups.

6. Trail: At night almost always a luminous train which can persist as long as a half hour (rarely). Daytime meteors are much less frequently observed. In daytime, leaves a whitish to dark smoke trail.

7. Sound: None

8. Course: Generally streaking downward, but not necessarily sharply downward. Can on rare occasion give impression of slight rise.

9. Time In Sight: Longest reported about 30 seconds, generally less than 10.

10. Lighting Conditions: Day or Night. Mostly night.

11. Other: An exceptionally bright meteor is called a fireball. These are rare but extremely spectacular and on occasion have been known to light surroundings to the brightness of daylight.


- page 27 -

STARS OR PLANETS

GENERAL
The planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are generally brighter than any star, but they twinkle very much less (unless very close to horizon). Stars twinkle a great deal and when near the horizon can give impression of flashing light in many colors.

1. Shape: Pinpoint - starlike.

2. Size: Never appreciable.

3. Color: Yellow with rainbow variations.

4. Speed: Stars apparent speeds carry them from east to west in the course of the night but they are often reported as erratic.
The effect is psychological, most people being unable to consider a point as being stationary. Occasionally turbulence in the upper atmosphere can cause a star to appear to jump (rare) but somehow twinkling gives the impression of movement to many people.

5. Formation: There are no clusters of very bright stars but faint stars are grouped in their familiar constellations.
Note: A report of 4 or 5 bright clustering lights would rule out stars.

6. Trail: None.

7. Sound: None.

8. Course: Always describe 24 hour circle around pole or sky from east to west.

9. Time In Sight: When clear, stars are always visible. Most stars rise or set during the course of the night. Stars low in western sky.

sky set within an hour or two. Stars in east, always
go higher in sky.

10. Lighting Conditions   Night - Twilight.

SEARCHLIGHTS

1. Shape:   Round to elliptical.

2. Size:    Pea at arms length to large luminous glow, dependent
            upon cloud height.

3. Color:   White fluorescent.

4. Speed:   Stationary to fantastic.

5. Formation: Usually only one but occasionally two or three.

6. Trail:   None

7. Sound:   None

8. Course:  Circling, straight, stationary or erratic. Note:
            Scattered clouds can give impression of object
            disappearing and reappearing in a different portion
            of the sky in a few seconds.

9. Time in Sight: Generally long.

10. Lighting Conditions: Night

OPTICAL PHENOMENA

GENERAL
This can cover a multitude of things.
Optical phenomena which have been reported as UFOBs run from
reflections on clouds and layers of ice crystals (sundogs) to the many
types of mirages. No one set of optical phenomena can be set down as
representation for the whole class.
There is no limit to the speed of optical phenomena. Reflections
can travel from incredible speed, as in the case of a search-beacon on
high clouds to stationary.
1. Shape: Generally round but can be elliptical or linear.
2. Size: Starlike to large luminous glow.
3. Color: Generally yellow
4. Speed: Stationary to fantastic.
5. Formation: Any.
6. Trail: None.
7. Sound: None.
8. Course: Any.
9. Time In Sight: Any.
10. Lighting Conditions: Day and night.
11. Other: One of the standard types is the "sundog". In this a large
luminous halo is seen around the sun with one to four
images of the sun placed along the halo circle at intervals
of 90 degrees. Another report often has to do with a bright
planet or even the moon shining through a light overcast.
Mirages reflections are said to occur frequently when
temperature inversions exist in the atmosphere.

UFOB GUIDE

This guide is designed for use in determining the feasibility of follow-up investigation of Unidentified Flying Object reports and in identifying the objects or phenomena concerned.

PART I

FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATIONS

GENERAL

An UFOB report is worthy of follow-up investigation when it contains information to suggest that a positive identification with a well known phenomenon may be made or when it characterizes an unusual phenomenon.

The report should suggest almost immediately, largely by the coherency and clarity of the data, that there is something of identification value and/or scientific value.

In general, reports which should be given consideration are those which involve several reliable observers, together or separately, and which concern sightings of greater duration than one quarter minute. Exception should be made to this when circumstances attending the report are considered to be extraordinary.

Special attention should be given to reports which give promise of a "fix" on the position and to those reports involving unusual trajectories.

RULES OF THUMB

Every UFOB case should be judged individually but there are a number of "rules of thumb," under each of the following headings, which should prove helpful in determining the necessity for follow-up investigation.

1. Duration of Sighting

When the duration of a sighting is less than 15 seconds, the probabilities are great that it is not worthy of follow-up. As a word of caution, however, should a large number of individual observers concur

Dear Ray:

In thinking over our telephone conversation, I am not certain whether you said Capt. Ruppelt would be here on the 23rd or 24th of January. I seem to recall that you have him scheduled for arrival 0930 hours on the 24th. We have the conference scheduled for 0815 local time. It is obvious that Ruppelt would need to arrive the day before. It will be most convenient for us if he could arrive at about 0930 on the 23rd and spend a full day in the office before his presentation Saturday morning. In any case, please bear in mind the 0815 time on Saturday 24 January.

Regards,

on an unusual sighting of a few seconds duration, it should not be
dismissed.

When a sighting has covered just a few seconds, the incident,
when followed-up in the past, has almost always proved to be a meteor or
a gross mis-identification of a common object owing to lack of time in
which to observe.

2. Number of Persons Reporting the Sighting

Short duration sightings by single individuals are seldom worthy
of follow-up.

Two or three competent independent observations carry the weight
of 10 or more simultaneous individual observations. As an example, 25
people at one spot may observe a strange light in the sky. This,
however, has less weight than two reliable people observing the same
light from different locations. In the latter case a position-fix is
indicated.

3. Distances from Location of Sighting to Nearest Field Unit

Reports which meet the preliminary criterion stated above should
all be investigated if their occurrence is in the immediate operating
vicinity of the squadron concerned.

For reports involving greater distances, follow-up necessity
might be judged as being inversely proportional to the square of the
distances concerned. For example, an occurrence 150 miles away might
be considered to have four times the importance (other things being equal)
than one that is 300 miles away.

2


- page 35 -

4. Reliability of Person or Persons Reporting

In establishing the necessity of follow-up investigation only "short term" reliability of individuals can be employed. Short term reliability is judged from the logic and coherency of the original report and by the age and occupation of the person. Particular attention should be given to whether the occupation involves observation reporting or technical knowledge.

5. Number of Individual Sightings Reported

Two completely individual sightings, especially when separated by a mile or more constitutes sufficient cause for follow-up, assuming previous criterion have not been violated.

6. The Value of Obtaining Additional Information Immediately

If the information cannot be obtained within seven days, the value of such information is greatly decreased.

It is of great value to obtain additional information immediately if previously stated criteria have been met. Often, if gathered quickly, two or three items (weather conditions, angular speed, changes in trajectory, duration, etc.) are sufficient for immediate evaluation.

If investigation is undertaken after weeks or months the original observers cease to be of value as far as additional new information is concerned. Generally, late interrogation yields only bare repetition of facts originally reported plus an inability on the part of the observer to be objective.

7. Existence of Physical Evidence (Photographs, Material, Hardware)

In cases where any physical evidence exists, a follow-up should

3

Here is the text from the document:

be made even if some of the above criteria have not been met.

CONCLUSION - Part I

It is understood that all above criteria must be evaluated in terms
of "common sense". The original report, from its wording and clarity will
almost always suggest to the reader whether there is any "psydir" in the
report.

4


- page 37 -

PART II

IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA

GENERAL

When an UFO report meets, in large measure, the criteria projected in Part I and a follow-up investigation is instituted, then the interrogator should ask what physical object or objects might have served as the original stimulus for the report. The word "object" here includes optical phenomena such as reflections from clouds, sundogs, etc.

Frequently one or perhaps two solutions will be immediately suggested by the nature of the report. The word "solution" cannot be used here in the scientific sense. A solution in UFOB work means that a hypothesis has been arrived at which appears to have the greatest probability of having given rise to the given report.

Following is a group of hypotheses or examples which should prove helpful in arriving at solutions. A check should be made to see how many of the items are satisfied by the report and how many are missing. An effort should be made to obtain any missing items as soon as possible.

Each typical hypothesis is listed on a separate page.

Occasionally turbulence in the upper atmosphere can cause a star to appear to jump (rare) but somehow twinkling gives the impression of movement to many people. Note: Just because the report says the light moves does not rule out the possibility of it being a star unless motion is from one part of sky to another in relatively short time.

Note: A report of 4 or 5 bright clustering lights would rule out stars.

OPTICAL PHENOMENA

GENERAL

This can cover a multitude of things. Original scanning of the report should be made to attempt to determine whether it more likely describes a material object or an optical phenomenon.

Optical phenomena which have been reported as UFOBs run from reflections on clouds and layers of ice crystals (sundogs) to the many types of mirages. No one set of optical phenomena can be set down as representation for the whole class.

There is no limit to the speed of optical phenomena. Reflections can travel from incredible speed, as in the case of a search-beacon on high clouds, to stationary.

These cases if well reported will almost always warrant follow-up. Their variety and connection with upper atmospheric conditions make these observations especially valuable scientifically.

1. Shape: Generally round but can be elliptical or linear.
2. Size: Starlike to large luminous glow.
3. Color: Generally yellow.
4. Speed: Stationary to fantastic.
5. Formation: Any.

10. Lighting Conditions: Day and night.

11. Radar: No return. In special cases radar response will occasionally have to do with unusual clouds, and meteorological phenomena such as described in Minneart's book "Light and Color in the Open Air."

12. Other: One of the standard types is the "sundog." In this a large luminous halo is seen around the sun with one to four images of the sun placed along the halo circle at intervals of 90 degrees. Another report often has to do with a bright planet or even the moon shining through a light overcast. Mirages reflections are said to occur frequently when temperature inversions exists in the atmosphere. If an optical phenomena is suspected, routine check of the meteorological records should be made to establish whether such inversions existed.

1006TH AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SQUADRON
United States Air Force
Ent Air Force Base, Colorado
8 October 1957

SUBJECT: Processing of Reports of Unidentified Flying Object Sightings

FROM: Commander
Air Defense Command
ACTIVE ADCON
Ent Air Force Base, Colorado

TO: Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence
Headquarters, USAF
ATTN: AFOINAI
Washington 25, D. C.

1. The following discussion and recommendations on the Air Force program, and the 1006th AISS participation therein, are submitted for your consideration.

2. OBJECTIVE: To eliminate duplication of effort which currently exists in processing reports of unidentified flying object (UFOB) sightings.

3. CURRENT PROCEDURES:

a. Air Defense Command. When a report of a UFOB sighting is received at Air Defense Command, it is routed directly to the 1006th AISS for processing. Other than signaling correspondence prepared by the 1006th AISS relating to UFOB matters, Air Defense Command assumes no further responsibility for processing UFOB reports.

b. The 1006th AISS. Upon receipt of a UFOB report, the 1006th AISS logs the report, completes a UFOB Index Card (reference Inclosure 1) and forwards a copy of the completed Index Card to ATIC. If the report indicates a need for investigation, the local detachment of the 1006th AISS or special investigators, continues the investigation and the results are forwarded to ATIC, Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, and other interested agencies. (The investigative activities of the 1006th AISS have been outlined through lack of space. The above description of procedures of the 1006th AISS are based on availability of manpower, however, investigation which can be conducted with no UFOB resources are always carried out.)

c. Air Technical Intelligence Center. Upon receipt of a UFOB report, an index card, practically identical to Inclosure 1, is prepared, if insufficient information exists on the initial report, or if certain records of the existing indicate a need for investigation, a request is made to Commander, 1006th AISS, through the

A1007, 1500th AMS, 8 Oct 57, Subj: Proceeding of Unidentified Flying Object Sighting

Commander, Air Defense Command, for the investigation, Since ATIC has sourced of information other than the 100th AMS, ATIC naturally requires fewer investigations than the 100th AMS normally conducts.

4. DISCUSSION. The procedures as outlined in paragraphs 3b and 3c above are a duplication of effort by ATIC and the 100th AMS. As has been once shown, the UFOB (Incl 1) is in use both by ATIC and this organization. Ordinarily, if the analysis of the 100th AMS disappears with that of ATIC, the analysis at ATIC will accept this analysis. Furthermore, any investigation in that is conducted without a requirement by ATIC is a waste of time and money. Finally, disregarding the time spent by detachment personnel of the 100th AMS in preparing the UFOB reports received by the detachments, it is a full time job for one man to process the UFOB reports received by this organization. In addition, supervisory and other personnel manually manipulate the UFOB investigations are required to spend time on the squadron UFOB program.

5. RECOMMENDATIONS:

a. It is recommended that the 100th AMS be relieved of the responsibility for routine processing of UFOB reports. All written UFOB reports (all reports submitted in other than message form) received by Air Defense Command will be personally directed to ATIC. ATIC would request each investigation desired, giving necessary details of the sighting in the reports. This organization would then conduct the investigation and report the results in accordance with current procedure.

b. The above recommendations could be carried out by administrative agreement. No change in existing regulations is necessary.

1. On 17 and 18 November 1954, the Commander, 462d AISS and his staff met with Captain Charles Hardin, ATIC, and Doctor Allen Hynek, USAF Contract Astronomer, for the purpose of discussing ATIC-462d AISS relationships in the investigation and processing of Unidentified Flying Objects reports. During the course of the conference general information was exchanged relative to the UFOB program, procedures were developed relative to the handling of UFOB reports and the criteria for evaluation of reports and conducting investigations were discussed.

2. The evaluation of all UFOB reports as well as the lines of inquiry of investigations, will be governed by the application of certain hypotheses to the data available. In the majority of cases, provided the information concerning the sighting is sufficiently complete, the data will suggest that the sighting was probably some known object or natural phenomena. For example, the data available might suggest to the investigator the hypothesis that the sighting was an aircraft. A check list will then be applied to the data using the hypothesis that the sighting was an aircraft. The check list will contain those items which, in combination, characterize aircraft from other possible objects or phenomena. For example, if the object was an aircraft, then there should have been noise, there should have been radar observation in certain areas, etc. The application of these check lists will suggest the lines of follow-up investigation in the event the data is insufficient to satisfy the elements of proof necessary to identification. ATIC will furnish the 462d AISS with the check lists to enable which will assist in the identification of UFOB's, and will cover, for example, aircraft, balloons, astronomical phenomena, guided missiles, etc. In addition a special evaluation or preliminary UFOB reports must be made to determine whether follow-up investigations can reasonably be expected to result in additional reliable and usable data.

3. Evaluation of Preliminary Reports:

a. ATIC will furnish the 462d AISS with "rules of thumb" criteria to be used by the Squadron Headquarters in determining the necessity for
