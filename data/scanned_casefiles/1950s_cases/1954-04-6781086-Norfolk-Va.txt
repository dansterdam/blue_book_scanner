REPORT OF SIGHTING OF STRANGE AND UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS IN C. R. ALLEN, ACCAP), USN, IN VICINITY OF LAKE DRUMMOND ON 7 APRIL 1954.

TIME: Approximately 1500, 7 April 1954.

LOCATION: Objects were first observed approximately two miles west of Lake Drummond at an altitude of 3500 feet.

OBJECTS SIGHTED: TWO DISC-SHAPED FLYING OBJECTS.

STATEMENT OF OBSERVER:

At approximately 1500, 7 April 1954, while engaged in flying an air patrol flight in a PV-2 type aircraft for Fleet Harding Center, Norfolk, I first observed two objects at an altitude of approximately 3500 feet at a point approximately 2 miles west of Lake Drummond. While in a left turn, I first sighted the objects in a left turn at approximately 3000 feet. Visibility in all directions was good. As near as I could determine, the objects were disc-shaped, flying in a loose formation approximately 1/2 mile from one another. By first estimate, the objects were approximately 1/2 mile from my aircraft. When first sighted, the objects were flying in a loose formation, and I was able to distinguish their relative position to my aircraft. They were flying at a slightly slower speed than my aircraft. They were dark in color - gray. They gave no apparent motion of evasive action. Directly ahead in the turn - the only impression there was that of very slight movement. As near as I could determine, they were approximately 30 miles in the time of my observation. They maintained approximately the same relative position as they flew. I noticed PV-2 of this sighting as soon as the objects left my sight. I notified PPC of this sighting as soon as possible after landing. Attached is a chart showing position, their path, by position, and position where objects were first sighted, their path, and position where objects disappeared. The base was of the sighted to broken cloud layer was 3500 to 3000 feet.

FIELD NOTES: A luminous round object believed to be a "flying saucer" was reported seen by three personnel on the night of Apr. 8 flying over the port of Kobe, Japan. They said they first saw a "crescent-shaped" object about 700 to 800 meters overhead, which gradually took a round shape, then a smaller shape again, and disappeared. It could not have been a star or moon. They said. (Incl. 1, Msg. fr CINCFE, NAGATA, MANILA, Apr. 9, 1954, 1815 Gmt--))
