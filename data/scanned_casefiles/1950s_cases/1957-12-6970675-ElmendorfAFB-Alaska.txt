ASTRONOMY

Venus Is Christmas Star

A crescent moon and the planet Venus will be close together on December 24, making a brilliant pair that lights the Christmas sky.

By JAMES STOKLEY

• This year we will have a real Christmas star. The planet Venus, which has been ceasing in prominence during the autumn, will be at its greatest brilliance on Dec. 22.

After the sky gets dark, around this date, Venus will be blazing in the southwest, until it follows the sun below the horizon, more than three hours later. But even this will not be the full extent of the display.

On Dec 24th, the moon, in a crescent phase, three days after the new moon, will rise just to the north of Venus. While the most appreciable conjunction, or touching daylight hours, they will still be close together that evening. Christmas eve, and will form a striking backdrop for the craters singing their Yuletide greeting.

Venus is the only planet that can be seen well on December evenings. On the evening, will Mercury and Arcturus briefly in the southwestern sky after the sun has set. Possibly, if you have a very clear view in that direction, and look closely, you can get a glimpse of this important of all the planets, but this is not really a favorable time to see Mercury.

No planets appear on the accompanying maps of the December evening skies, for these show their appearance later in the evening after Venus has set. They are drawn for about 10:30 pm, your own local standard time, on Dec. 1, and an hour earlier at the middle of the month.

In the southwest there is now visible the brilliant array of stars which make the skies of the winter evening so beautiful.

Dog-Star Is Brightest

Brightest of these stars is Sirius, the dog-star, part of Canis Major, the great dog shown near the horizon. However, in low altitude causes a partial diminution of its light. Later in the night as it climbs higher in the southern sky and is then even more conspicuous.

On the astronomer's scale of star brightness, Sirius is of magnitude minus 1.4, which means that it exceeds any other star that we can see in the nighttime sky. Compared to Venus, however, it is relatively faint, for the magnitude of that planet is minus 4. Venus may be nearly 10 times brighter or Sirius.

In this group are two bright stars of the "first magnitude": Betelgeuse, in the head and right, a little lower and to the right of Sirius; and Aldebaran, one of the fainter stars that form Orion's belt.

Directly above Orion the Taurus, the bull, rises later, about two hours before the sun, in Libra, the scales.

If, on Christmas eve, when the crescent moon is hanging nearly, you look at Venus through a telescope, you will find that it also is a crescent phase.

Crescent Venus

It will not be quite as thin a crescent as that of the moon, but more like the moon some two days later, or about five days after it is new.

The reason for the lunar phases is found in the fact that as the moon revolves around the earth, it presents a different amount of its illuminated hemisphere. At new, it is partially between the sun and us; the sunlit half is entirely turned away and we see nothing. But a few days later, as the moon swings sunward from the direction of the sun, it remains in the western sky for a while after the sun has set. A narrow sliver of the bright half then appears to us, as a crescent. Then, as it swings full facing away from the sun, half, three-quarters, and finally all, of the sunlit side is presented to us, bringing the full moon.

This takes about two weeks. During the next two weeks the changes occur in reverse order, and the moon is new once again. Something similar happens to Venus.

Science News Letter for November 23, 1957

Like the moon, it has no light of its own
but is illuminated by the sun, so that one
half is bright and the opposite half dark.
Last April 14 it was out beyond the sun
with the entire bright hemisphere turned
earthwards. Since then it has been moving
and is now coming between the earth and
sun. Thus, most of its orbit is now between
turned away, and we have a crescent phase.

On Jan. 28 it will be nearly directly
between us and the sun, and its will
be seen in the morning sky, visible in the
morning sky before sunrise.

Unlike the moon, Venus is always so
far away that only through a telescope are
its phases visible.

The phases of Venus differ from those of
the moon in another respect.

As the moon travels around the earth, is
distance does not change very greatly, only
from about 221,000 miles to 253,000 miles.
Thus there is no great change in its apparent size, and the diameter of the full
moon is about the same as when it is in a
narrow crescent phase. But when Venus is
full it is out far beyond the sun, about
160,000,000 miles away. Just before Christmas it will be less than 40,000,000 miles
away, and on Jan. 28 its distance will be
about 26,000,000 miles. Thus, at its
near the "new" phase, it is much larger,
seemingly, in the sky.

That is why it is brightest when a crescent. Although less than half of the bright
side is visible to us, its proximity more
than makes up for this, and the part we
can see fills the largest area of the sky.
Then it is at the greatest brilliance.

Winter Arrives

On Dec. 21 the sun, which has apparently
been traveling southward in the sky since
last June, reaches its southernmost point.
This is the winter solstice—the beginning
of winter in the Northern Hemisphere—and
it occurs at 9:49 p. m. EST.

At that moment the sun will be directly
over a point near the eastern edge of the
Arnaud Desert, which is in Australia, on
the border between Queensland and the
Northern Territory. In Australia, and other
southern countries, the sun will be high
in the sky, marking summer's beginning.

                                MYSTERY SKY OBJECT
The OPP is investigating an unidentified "illuminated object" which
darted over Eatonville 30 miles east of Chatham, Ontario, Canada, Dec.
12, 1957. It was headed in the direction of Windsor.

Witnesses could give no explanation of the strange sight, but said
the phenomena was "much brighter and lower than any star."

It was first spotted about 7 p.m. by Mrs. Robert Moore of RR 2, near
Blenheim. She said it drew an arc over Eatonville and continued in a
westward direction.

"At first I thought it was a star but it was a hundred times brighter."
"It was the size of a football and appeared quite low in the sky."

District radar units reported height at from 35,000 to 40,000 feet.
Const. Ted Wickens of Chatham and John McPherson of Ridgetown OPP
were sent to the scene and both saw the object.

Wickens said he saw the object in slight for over 20 minutes.
"It was far too bright for a meteor or star."

Telephone lines into OPP headquarters in Chatham were jammed
with calls from persons who sighted the object and defense units
from as far away as Peterboro.

13 December 1957
COLLINSVILLE, Illinois

Friday morning, December 13, 1957 (Yesterday) at around 5:00 A.M.

(Concluded from Page 15)

A.M., a strange light was seen over Belleville, Illinois. About 6 miles southeast is located what is known as Scott Air Base (Army Training Base). The time that I had the pleasure of seeing "Object" in question was about 8:05 A.M. hovering very stationary over Collinville, Illinois which city is located about 6 miles North of Belleville.

At this time, the sun shown so clearly upon the "Object" (sunrise) that - it appeared as an intense SILVER LIGHT. It appeared as you would hold a silver dollar at arm's length edge toward you and tilt it slightly showing its bottom side. Our Government reported this as a weather balloon.
