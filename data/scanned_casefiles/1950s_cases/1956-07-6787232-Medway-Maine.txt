1.     SOURCE:
        Address: Portage, Maine. (HGCB 3146).
        Age: 44

        Occupation: Owner and Operator of chain of Sporting Camps on
        lakes in the interior of Northern Maine.

        Education: College.

        Qualifications: Mr. was a pilot under volunteer status
        during World War II, with the Civil Air Patrol and the Corps of Army Engineers.

II.    RELIABILITY: In view of the facts as stated by persons knowing Mr.
        for several years past, there can be little doubt as to his integrity and
        judgement.

III.   SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: While progressing southward on Man-
        sugan Lake (HGCB 0022) at a speed of 4 MPH, Mr. was attracted to
        an object streaming across the sky from West to East, by another member of the
        party in his boat. The time was estimated to be 1921052 Jul 56. By the time Mr.
        had located the object, he had only 2 or 3 seconds in which to follow it.

        The object was seen while the sun was high in the sky, there was no wind,
        and no clouds were present in the sky. The temperature also was normal for this
        area. As seen by Mr. , he estimated the brightness to be about the same as
        that of an automobile headlight several blocks away, and also resembling a head-
        light. It was about the size of a baseball held at arms length and resembling a
        bright star, around the edges.

        Mr. declared that it would be impossible for him to assert positive-
        ly as to the color, as it varied in color from a faded red to an orange, and then
        to a yellow, leaving behind a wavy trail similar to that of a jet, conspicuously
        much smoother, and also a lighter color, almost white. He further stated that he
        could not judge as to the transparency or solidity of the object, therefore he
        would have no way of knowing what types of materials would be needed if another
        object like it was to be constructed, and again, if it could be constructed, he
        would have no idea of the exact shape.

        Mr. further stated that after watching this object cross the sky and
        disappear behind a ridge of hills not too far from his lake, he would use the
        rest of the party heard a faint, a very low explosion, much like that which would
        come if a large cache of dynamite might blow up.

        When asked if he had ever seen anything which resembled this object, Mr.
        very quickly answered that he had not, and he felt that he would recall it if
        he ever had. He declared that his first thought was of a disabled jet, but after
        seeing and thinking about the speed, he felt certain that was not likely. This
        object was traveling at about three times the speed of any jet he had ever seen.

1. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted] Stockholm, Maine (HKGC 5102)
Age: 46
Occupation: Housewife
Education: High School

Qualifications: Mrs. [redacted] information seems to be very accurate with the exception of measurements. Her perception of distances appears to be defective.

II. RELIABILITY: Mrs. [redacted] is judged reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: While walking along the highway, one half mile north of Stockholm, Maine, in the company of a friend, Mrs. [redacted] happened to look up and saw an object moving from Northwest to Southeast across the sky. She estimated it to be about two miles away from the position which they were occupying at the time. The object was seen in bright daylight and had the brightness of an automobile headlight several blocks away.

As this object passed through the air, it left a trail of light, almost white smoke, which did not last as long as that left by a jet, and was much lighter. This smoke trail followed a flame approximately fifty times longer than the object itself.

The object was cone shaped, silver colored and appeared to be approximately the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, and flame emitting from it was of a yellow color. The edges of the object were sharply outlined against the sky.

Mrs. [redacted] watched this object for approximately fifteen seconds before it finally disappeared, during the course flow at a slow rate of view behind anything in the sky, there being no clouds, and the weather being about normal for this season.

Source stated that she had no way of judging what the object could have been, since she had not seen anything like it before. But she again stated that it resembled an oversized ice cream cone, constructed of an aluminum or silver material.

Mrs. [redacted] and her companion sighted this object on 19 July 1956, at approximately 2160Z. They were walking in a southerly direction toward Stockholm village, and faced south for the full duration of the sighting.

         Age: 63
         Katahdin area.
         Occupation: Paper Mill Repairman, and one time guide for the Mt.

         Education: Grade School

         Qualifications: Mr. _____ was for several years a guide in
         this area of the state, and is well acquainted with distances and directions which
         might be questioned in this matter.

II.     RELIABILITY: As far as can be judged in the course of this investigation,
         while talking with Mr. _____, the several neighbors who live near him, his
         reliability is impregnable. Honesty and truthfulness have always been a great
         part of his makeup.

III.    SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Mr. _____ in the company of a Mr.
         were fishing at Debsconeag Dam, (HKGA G347), approximately fifteen miles
         West of Millinocket, on Friday afternoon, 19 July 1956, when their attention was
         attracted to an object approaching from the Southwest, flying fairly close to the
         ground. Mr. _____ judged it to be approximately three to four hundred feet eleva-
         tion. This object was watched until 15 minutes from its first sighting. It was
         the tree tops. The length of time required to pass from view, after sighting it,
         was from 20 to 30 seconds. They were not positive as to the exact time but judged
         it to be shortly after 192100Z Jul 56, and were more positive that the sun could
         have nothing to do with what they saw. Even though the sun was shining brightly,
         there were no clouds visible from where they were located, or any other objects
         which could have been reflecting sunlight.

         One thing which both men definitely believe, is that it was a solid object,
         and they had ample time to observe it fully, watching it from both directions.
         Observed the trail of fire which followed it, also the smoke trail which it left.
         The fire itself was rather than the background of the sky, and disappeared
         twice during the time the men were watching it. The flame emitting from the rear
         of the object was similar to that which is seen following a jet aircraft after dark,
         while coming from the top of the object at approximately the center of it, was a
         small flame of bright blue, which went straight up, curving with the force of the
         air after it left the object. The color of the object near a dark metal color. The
         flame trail was judged to be approximately twelve feet long.

         During the time this object was observed by these two men it did not alter
         course and apparently did not come closer to the ground. It seemed to be guided
         along a straight course, from the time they first saw it until it disappeared from
         view. One thing which they both thought very odd, was the fact that there was no
         sound whatsoever, and they both felt if it had enough force to push itself along,
         at the rate it was going, there definitely should have been sound. The object was
         traveling directly against the wind which was blowing from the Northwest at the
         time.

    Age: 35
    Occupation: Sporting Camp Owner and Operator on [redacted]
    Maine, (HGCQ 4158)
    Education: Grade School

    Qualifications: Mr. [redacted] has in the past been a police worker in New Jersey, and also on the Maine State Police. At the present time, he is a worker for Hancock County, Maine.

II. RELIABILITY: While locating Mr. [redacted], several residents in that area remarked on the reliability and integrity of the man as being above reproach, and that he reported seeing this object, he surely saw it.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: While moving from one fishing spot to another on Great Pond on Friday afternoon, 19 July 1956, Mr. [redacted] happened to be looking at the scenery around the lake, and spotted the object. He estimated it to be directly north of the position of his boat. The object was sighted at approximately 1920 hours, 19 Jul 1956. It was moving rapidly from west to east, and he observed it for at least six seconds. The sun at the time was well to the left of the object, in fact at an angle of at least 90 degrees, from the sun to the object. At the horizon level. The sun was in the west, and he estimated the object to be at about three north. It was much brighter than the sky itself, about 1/2 as intensely or an automobile headlight several blocks away, and leaving behind it a grayish colored trail. This trail soon disappeared though, much quicker than a trail left by a jet aircraft. Mr. [redacted] was wearing eyeglasses at the time, as he does constantly.

There was no sound from the object, but the head or front of it was bright and sharply outlined, while the back or tail, was fuzzy and blurred and seemed to be of a blue and gray color. It was shaped like a tube, with a head which resembled a football in contour. He estimated the object to be approximately ten feet long. (Part of this length, in fact all of it, could have been the trail of fire which was left behind). It was estimated by Mr. [redacted] to be approximately the size of a quarter in diameter if the quarter was held at arm's length.

This object appeared in the sky and disappeared again, much the same as one turning on and off an electric light. Mr. Larson stated that if he was going to try to reproduce this object in its entirety, he would first start with one of the old type sealed beam headlights which were not glare proof, and from there on it would be difficult to choose a metal or material which would compare with this.

At the time Mr. [redacted] discovered the object, he was moving northward on the lake, and immediately after seeing it, he cut his motor and drifted while watching the object. As soon as it disappeared he proceeded to his landing and attempted to call the GOC post which is only a short distance from his camp. Failing in this, he proceeded by car to the post where his report could be easily dispatched to the Filter Center.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check was made with Presque Isle Flight Service at Presque Isle AFB by OTC Flight 3-G, 4602d AISS, for aircraft in the area at the time of sighting, with negative results.

2. The Observatory and Planetarium at the University of Maine, Orono, (HUG 1952) was contacted. The Professor of Astronomy, Dr. Maynard Jordan, gave the following facts:

    a. The Observatory and Planetarium at the University was closed during the time of the sighting.

    b. There could definitely be more than one meteor in the same general area at the same time.

    c. That meteors can explode much the same as the one reported by Mr. _____, but, it would have to be a large one, and probably would leave some physical evidence, if the location of the landing could be found.

    d. There are no other planetariums within the State of Maine which would be able to furnish other information.

3. The information received from the Presque Isle AFB, Weather Station indicated the following:

    a. Winds varied from Surface at 8 knots, to 50 knots at 30,000 feet, with the surface winds coming from NNW.

    b. A few scattered clouds were present at 4500 feet, with 20 miles visibility, and no precipitation.

4. The 765th ACW Squadron, Charleston, Maine. (HICA 5705), was contacted, but did not report having picked up anything on their radar.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

    1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, these sightings were probably meteors. The following items tend to strengthen this opinion.

        a. Shape - Generally about the shape of a football.
        b. Size - In all instances it was reported as about the size of a football.
        c. Color - Flaming yellow with red, green or blue hues.
        d. Speed - Travels great distances in seconds.
        e. Although in two instances, the people seemed to feel this object was some type of missile or small type of aircraft, there is nothing to substantiate this.

[Signature of Preparing Officer]

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:

    1. It is to be noted that the Approving Officer does not agree with the comments of the Preparing Officer concerning the uniformity of the size, shape, and color of the objects. The records of the few cases vary considerably, and, consequently, no generalization can be made.

    2. However, the Approving Officer concurs with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that these sightings were probably meteors in the same general area at approximately the same time.

    3. In all four instances, the sightings conformed to meteor criteria regarding size, shape, color, speed, length of time observed, etc.

    4. In addition, Dr. Maynard F. Jordan, Professor of Astronomy, University of Maine, confirmed the possibility that there could be more than one meteor in the same general area at the same time, which was probably the case in this particular series of sightings.
