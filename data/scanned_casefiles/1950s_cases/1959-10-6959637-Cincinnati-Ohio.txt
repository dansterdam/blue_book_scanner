Gentlemen,

I am sending you a report on a UFO sighting & experience. This report is the truth and nothing but the truth. You will find my name, address, phone number, age, and grade on other sheet. You probably wonder why I waited so long in giving this report. I wanted to make sure what the object was. I have read stock after stock on flying & saucer and now I am convinced that what I saw was a flying saucer. You will find a drawing of this object on the back of this paper.
