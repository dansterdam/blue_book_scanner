4. How long was object seen? - From 15 to 30 seconds.

5. How certain of this? - Very certain.  

6. Condition of sky? - very clear - visibility good.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten document. The text in the document describes an observation of a "mountain range" and various details about the object observed, such as its size, color, and movement. It also includes a diagram or sketch showing the shape and position of the observed object in relation to the horizon. There is no text that identifies any individuals.

12. Why it move in front of something?
It was already in front of this mountain range, from 25 to 100 miles to the east between the mountain and the sea.

13. The object appeared to be stationary and was not transparent.

14. It did not move or change its size through any glasses.

15. It was a very wonderful clear sky with our naked eyes.

16. Following is a sketch of the object.

17. It was about the size of a ball of fire - smooth edges.

18. How many objects were seen?
Only one object was seen.

19. Motion of object -.

20. Size of object - The size of the object was seen to be from 35 to 50 miles wide, and it was higher than usual as compared to familiar aircraft. It was not a familiar type of the country, and so most know that it was not any conventional type from the highway.

Here is the text from the document, produced as OCR output:

24. Compare the object to a metallic shell out at an arms distance. 
25. Warm fairly bright - the above conclusion.
23. What was the apparent size at the top of the mountains, about half way from ground to top - the disappearing rapidly upward. This happened in a matter of seconds.
24. Consider the flight - the closest it can appear at, is that it was similar to the noon shining of the sun, except it was difficult - a vivid orange red - Normally, it was more the same as a meteor but very fast, at the top of the mountains, the size was about 10:00 A.M.
25. We were in a car.
26. What direction from country-side?
27. What were you doing at the time?
We were traveling northward on a highway, about 45 M.P.H.
28. He was moving approximately to the west-southwest at 45 M.P.H.
24. What direction were you looking - eastward?
30. What description were you making of the object - It was fantastic.
31. Remind Mr. Dupree from notes, though it was not far above the horizon when it disappeared and about that wide.

33. Object partially, when first and last seen.
34. Weather conditions: Clear sky - slight breeze - day - warm.
35. June 6, 1956 - (So you)(U.S.A.F.) - (First report to official)
36. Was anyone else with you? Yes. 
a. Describe what the object:
b. Name address:
Mr. [redacted]
Bakersfield, Calif.
37. Was this the first time you have seen such an object? Yes.
38. Do you opinion what the the object was? In my opinion what he said about the object was as follows: It was silvery and shaped like an ordinary high-speed aircraft with the characteristics of a jet. However, it appeared as if it had a very flexible tail or wing section, which seemed to change and maneuver unlike any jet or conventional aircraft I have ever seen. At this time, my friend and I thought it was some new experimental aircraft from one of our own secret guided missile test ranges. However, a few seconds later, it disappeared into the sky at a fantastic rate of speed.
39. Estimated speed. It disappeared so fast it could not be measured.
40. Which way was it travelling at the time - straight, up, down, left or right? It was travelling straight in a horizontal direction. 
41. Don't know - lost to view it vanished so quickly. I could say very fast.

DATE QUESTIONNAIRE COMPLETED - 30 JUNE, 1956
SUMMARY OF EVENT:
NAME - [REDACTED]
SIGNATURE - [REDACTED] 
DATE - JUNE 30, 1956

On the morning of an April 6, May Day in 1956, while travelling motorized with a friend on a highway about 10 miles Southeast of Bakersfield, California, he pulled over to the side of the road at about 10:00 A.M. to permit another motorist to pass. He and his friend, who was sitting beside him, then observed a strange object in the sky. It was circular in shape and appeared to be hovering about 2,000 feet in the air. The object gave off a brilliant white light and was about 50-75 feet in diameter. The object remained stationary for a few minutes, then suddenly shot up into the sky at a very high rate of speed, and the next time it looked, it was already disappearing from view over the horizon. The entire sighting lasted about 30 seconds. The man was astonished and could not explain what he had seen. He said it was only a part of the sighting, as the man was motioned by a sign from his friend to look up out of the car window, indicating that the object was above them. He also stated that there appeared to be five miles from one to five miles from him and that it was extremely bright and caused him and his friend to rub their eyes. The witness now believes that what he saw was some type of unusual aircraft, although he does not know what it was. He said he would be willing to help in any way he could if asked to do so before then.

This image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Then the background of this and mountains a lighter and more orange. 

This is about all the information I can give on this. I repeat this is not a "hot" or false case, but an account. Remember, there was no motion, no another vapor trail, so the object seemed to come and go without any apparent activity, although we are not certain at all why they should thus suddenly appear or disappear or to make such flight as this - if it was not a hoax or misidentification. It is not clear at all what this means, but we are the puzzled and cannot offer any explanation, so please record this for whatever it may be worth.

Sincerely yours,

WITNESSES:
1. D STANWOOD, WASH.
2. [REDACTED], GARBANA, CALIF.
