Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sir:

Corresponding in reply to your communication of January 14, 1952, regarding the sighting of unidentified aerial objects over Anchorage, Alaska, on January 12, 1952.

Your report of this incident has been carefully reviewed and considered by the staff of this Headquarters. The attached summary indicates that the observed phenomenon, while unusual, is not considered to be of hostile or unnatural origin and therefore not of operational concern to the Air Force.

Your interest and cooperation in reporting this incident are greatly appreciated. Should you have any additional information or observations to submit, please do not hesitate to forward them to this office for consideration.

Sincerely yours,

5th and final
This end did not return
June 7-at about 7:15 p.m.
I was on the highway a short distance from Anchorage. About 3/4 mile south of Anchorage we looked up and saw an object in the sky quite high, white in color and seemed to be going at a very rapid rate. As it passed over us it did not make any sound. I looked like a large white object. The object just disappeared. There was no flame trailing the object. The object did not seem to get any larger or smaller as it passed over us. There was no other air traffic that we could see at the time.
There was no peculiarity in the maneuver -
It was very bright and quick.
