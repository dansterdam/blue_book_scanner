Dear Sirs:

I am sending a copy I made of the letter by the Brookhart Research Association of Calif. It seems almost impossible to believe, but I am enclosing it by this Force base near to know about it?

I am inclined not to believe it, but I hope that you will be good to the letter. I hope this news - most interesting, and that Mr. Palmer will come to enclose and bring his own printed and witnesses his friend from the flying success to me, because it is like nothing better than to know one out of it - this would be good if I! That would be my question positively!!

Anyway I think if you will like this while along with a copy of this also prints. I let you want to believe it!

Sincerely yours,
Shirley Walter

5th and final

This end did not receive

Jan. 7 - at about 7:45 A.M.
4 A.M.

I saw this peculiar long object in the sky while early to work this morning. A few traveling along 5th Avenue between Seward Corners and 5th Street. Will see a few of others out too. It looked like a "can, white vapor trail and very clearly defined. The end which was moving was as sharp as a needle, and the rest was like a long cycle. But was no doubt I could see no place leading the vapor trail. The craft just over or in the sky above close, and then continued on. I could clearly see it curve, its shape and its outline.

There was no volume or shape or vicinity.

It was very, very long and quite high!
