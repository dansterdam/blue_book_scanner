    a. Asst Director of Plans & Intelligence
    b. The youth of the Observer, coupled with an apparent interest in celestial-scientific knowledge could have led to an over-imaginative observation. Due to the relative positions of the Observers and the planet Mars, they would have been looking directly over the City of Washington and would have been visible. Heavier air traffic and lights in this area could have created a false impression. The observers in their excitement and they apparently saw something which they were seeking personal notoriety. The reliability of this report is unknown.
