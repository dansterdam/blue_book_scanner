SUMMARY: (State concise summary of report, cite significance in final conclusion paragraph)

"While fishing at Temara Beach, Tuesday, 27 May 1952 at 1315z, my attention was
called to an object, estimated to be between 1000 and 2000 yards off shore, by an Arab
boy that was with me. I asked him if he was a buoy marker or the mast of a sinking
ship. He said it was neither one as far as he knew, and that he had never seen it
before.

"I have lived at Temara Beach six months and frequently fished in the same place,
and I have never seen it before.

"The object was under our observation for a period of from twenty to thirty
minutes.

"The sea was very calm at this time without any white caps at all. The tide had
started in at this time, but the sea was still calm.

"I made a line of sight on the object with reference to three other objects (see
sketch) and it did not move during the time of observation.

"I have over nine hundred hours of flying time over water and eighteen months in
the Pacific Theater. I have seen submarines periscopes from the air and from the shore.
This object resembled one very much.

"I looked for the object at 1800z but was unable to locate it.

"On the morning of 28 May 1952 at 0730z I was still unable to locate it, although
the condition of the sea and visibility were nearly the same."
