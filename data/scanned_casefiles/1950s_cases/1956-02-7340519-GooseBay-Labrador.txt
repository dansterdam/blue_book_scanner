SUBJECT: Goose Bay, Labrador, 12 Feb 56

TO: TDEW/Sgt Moody

The information in this report is too incomplete for an evaluation to be made. It is not logical for a genuine target to "fade" and disappear when the fighter gets close to it - the normal situation is for the target to get stronger the closer the fighter gets to it.
