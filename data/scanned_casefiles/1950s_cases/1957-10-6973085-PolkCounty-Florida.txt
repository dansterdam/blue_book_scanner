Unidentified Flying Objects

[redacted] was called by Mr. [redacted] of the Lakeland, Florida, Ledger who reported that at 2 p.m. on Wednesday 23 October, a large gondola shaped unidentified object was observed hovering over Polk County at about 80,000 feet. Local residents called the Miami Filter Center. The USAF Base and the Security Officer at Patrick AF Base. Allegedly all of these individuals indicated they had no idea what the object was and no effort to investigate was made. The people are disturbed about this attitude on the part of the Air Force and feel that the Air Force's responsibility was not fulfilled. Senator [redacted] has asked for a report in this matter as soon as possible.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

28 October 1957

Dear Captain Elwood:

Senator [redacted] office called Brigadier General C. D. Jones, Deputy Director of the Office of Legislative Liaison with reference to a large gondola-shaped Unidentified Flying Object which hovered over Pope County, Florida at approximately 80,000 feet at 1400 hours on Wednesday, 23 October 1957.

The Senator was concerned because local residents called the Miami Filter Center, the USAF at Pinecasble and McDill Air Force Bases and the Security Officer at Patrick Air Force Base with negative results. Allegedly all of these individuals indicated that they had no idea what the object was and made no effort to investigate.

The people are disturbed about this attitude on the part of the Air Force and feel that the Air Force's responsibility was not fulfilled. This sighting should have been reported to your headquarters immediately in accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 12 August 1954.

Will you please check your records to see if this sighting was reported to your headquarters from any other sources. If an identification or evaluation of this sighting is possible, please send the results to me as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

With the exception of the official press release referred to above, the Air Force has not cleared, sponsored, or otherwise controlled any such news story, pictorial, public release, or other informational material on the subject of unidentified aerial objects.

Dear Senator

Recently you furnished me with information concerning an unidentified aerial object over Polk County, Florida, on 23 October 1957.

Details of this sighting of an unidentified aerial object have been forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, for possible analysis and identification. The report of findings, if any, will be forwarded to your office as soon as it is received.

On 5 May 1955, the Department of the Air Force declassified its special study, Project Bluebook, Report Number 14, Analysis of Reports on Unidentified Aerial Objects. On 23 October 1951, the Department of Defense released the summary of the Air Force study. A copy of the news release and summary are enclosed for your information. It should show the Air Force had reached the number of unknown sightings from approximately ten percent in 1951 to approximately three percent of 30 June 1957, about to be published, show the unknown to be less than two percent. The enclosed findings are of concern to the Air Force and will continue to be investigated. There are, however, several primary factors causing the results of our study which may be indicated. The study has shown

There is a total lack of evidence that the phenomena observed have inimical or hostile forces behind them.

There is a total lack of evidence that they are interplanetary vehicles.

There is a total lack of evidence that they constitute any threat to the security of the United States.

cases will not be made public. Most of the persons who report sightings to the Air Force do so in confidence and their wishes are respected.

The Air Force does not consider the unidentified aerial objects as a threat to the national security. Each case will continue to be studied with qualified scientific and technicians in the investigating agencies analyzing scientific and technical aspects of each reported case with only one end in view, to establish the truth.

A copy of our letter to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, his been forwarded to each of the Commanders of the Air Force activities involved in Florida, in case to preclude the possibility of any indifference with respect to this subject.

Dear Captain Elwood:

This Center received a courtesy copy of Major L. J. Tucker's letter to you of 28 October 1957, regarding "a large gondola shaped unidentified Flying Object which hovered over Pope (sic) County, 23 October 1957". It is believed that Polk County is the correct location as there is no Pope County in Florida.

An investigation has not uncovered any record of the reference call having been received at this Center. Four or the five pertinent agencies checked, maintain blotters of logs on such calls. The Fifth agency, the AFMTC Staff Provost Marshall, also has no knowledge of the call.

It is regretted that this Center can not be of further assistance in this matter. A study by this office revealed that over 90% of the UFO calls are the result of sightings relating to our operations (missile, weather balloon, aircraft instrumentation and range instrumentation checks).

Sincerely yours,

UFO SIGHTING, LAKE WALES
23 October 1957
Reported on tape by [redacted]

Wednesday afternoon at approximately 3:00 I received a phone call from an observer in Lake Wales telling me that there was an object in the sky at what he figured was 20 thousand feet. I went outside of my office and looked up viewing this object. Then proceeded to check with the Orlando radio on the chance that it might be a weather balloon. Orlando had nothing reported in the area, and since it is practice to report these balloons, we decided that we would go up and take a look at this object. We entered a Piper Apache aircraft (twin engine) and proceeded to climb up to try and view this object.

We climbed to 16,500 feet over Haines City and had the object in view all the time. At 16,500 the object appeared to be 50 to 60 thousand feet above us. We kept the object in sight circling it at all times, thereby eliminating the possibility that it might be a star.

Upon receiving the upper winds report giving us winds at 50 thousand feet at 22 knots, we disqualified the chance that it might be a weather balloon because of the fact that at 22 knots wind a weather balloon would have been drifting; and this object stayed stationary directly over Haines City for more than 2 hours as we were up 3:30 till almost 6:00 searching this object.

The object appeared to have some sort of a tail or trailing fuselage type design. It appeared to be oblong in shape. The tail part of the object was not visible at all times probably due to sunlight reflection.

We discount the fact that it could have been a weather balloon due to the fact that the object was much too shiney. Weather balloons are coated all with a powdery effect so that they won't shine and reflect. All the people in the a/c with me during this time were licensed pilots who have been flying for many years and have seen many such weather balloons; and therefore, we discounted the weather balloon theory on the basis of our own past experience.

We kept the object in sight until approximately 5:42 at which time the object appeared to be ascending rapidly and on our next circling of the object, it had completely disappeared.

There appeared to be no descent whatsoever to the object.

This is [redacted]

WASHINGTON, NOV. 18 --(UP)-- THE AIR FORCE SAID TODAY THAT "FLYING SAUCERS" REPORTED OVER JACKSONVILLE AND POLK COUNTY, FLORIDA, LATE LAST MONTH HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TENTATIVELY AS A SINGLE LARGE WEATHER BALLOON DRIFTING OVER THE STATE.

THIS EXPLANATION, A SPOKESMAN EMPHASIZED, IS "NOT FINAL" BUT "ALL EVIDENCE SO FAR AVAILABLE" INDICATES THAT NO "STRANGE OBJECTS" WERE SEEN.

GEORGE A. SMATHERS (D-FLA.) HAD ASKED THE AIR FORCE FOR AN EXPLANATION OF A REPORT OF A "SO-CALLED" FLYING SAUCER OVER POLK COUNTY ON OCT. 23. A SIMILAR REPORT WAS RECEIVED BY THE AIR FORCE FROM JACKSONVILLE A FEW DAYS LATER.

SILVER-COLORED BALLOONS ARE REGULARLY USED TO CARRY METEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS ALOFT TO GATHER WEATHER INFORMATION.
