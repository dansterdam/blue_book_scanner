Dear Lt. Col. Friend,

A Air Force Friend of Mine was Telling Me About Your UFO Investigation Center There, and I Thought I Would Ask You About A Sighting of A Strange Floating Object I Seen A Few Years Ago. It Was Back in 1951 At My Father's Farm Where I'm Residing Now. I Was Taking A Walk Down Are Dirt Road When I Got to The Second Curve(About A Thousand Foot From The House) I Noticed Over A Neighbor's Woods, A Large

SILVER OBJECT ABOUT 30 
FT. OVER THE TREES. I WAS 
900 FT FROM IT AND OBSERVED 
IT VERY CLOSELY. IT HUNG 
THERE FOR ABOUT 5 MIN. 
AND IT DIDN'T MAKE A SOUND 
I WAS FLABBERGASTED 
SOMETHING I'LL NEVER FORGET 
IN MY LIFE. IT HUNG THERE 
LIKE I SAY FOR ABOUT 5 MIN 
THEN IT SLOWLY BEGAN 
MOVING SOUTH PICKING UP 
SPEED AS IT WENT UNTIL 
IT GOT OVER DAVIDSON'S 
FARM (THE NEIGHBOR)'S ABOUT 
1/4 OF A MILE THEN SHOOT 
OFF IN A WHITE STREAK. 
HERE IS A GENERAL SKETCH 
OF IT

Dear Dr. [redacted]

This is in response to your recent inquiry for an evaluation of an unidentified object sighting you witnessed in 1951.

The Air Force is unable to make any evaluation of your observation although your description contained essential data and was quite clear and explicit.

Attached is the latest Air Force Fact Sheet on the Aerial Phenomena Program. In it is an explanation of why it is sometimes impossible to reach a conclusion on a sighting even though sufficient details are given, and the case remains listed in the "Unidentified" category.

It is regretted that we are unable to give you a definite answer on your query. It may be of interest that in over 3,000 sightings during the past 15 years, there has never been any evidence or indication that Unidentified Flying Objects represent either a threat to the security of the United States or an extraterrestrial vehicle under intelligent control.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
