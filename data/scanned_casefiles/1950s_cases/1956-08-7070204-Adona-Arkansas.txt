Commanding General

Little Rock, Arkansas

Dear Sir:

I do not know to whom I should write this letter but the air base seemed the best place. This morning around four o'clock my mother and I what at first glance looked like a star, but when we looked closer we could tell it was not. It was much brighter and larger than a star and was giving off rays. It stayed stationary in this east from our house until around five we noticed it. Had moved further east and a little south.

This is the third time we have seen such an object in the early hours of morning although I don't remember like other giving off rays or lights as distinctly as

during... etc. Christmas holidays of 1956.
We are also very interested in the
range of lights given off by this object...
because... at one time this morning we
were standing outside under a tree
watching it when some rays came
directly at us, although we didn't
realize this until the area around
the tree limbs above our heads
lit up for about a second or two;
therefore, engulfing us also.
If you can tell us anything
about this object we would
appreciate it very much.

Sincerely yours,
[redacted]
Adona, Arkansas.
