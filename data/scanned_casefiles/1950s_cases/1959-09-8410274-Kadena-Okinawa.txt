CAN BE STATED FOR THE ON VISUAL SIGHTING WHICH WAS REPORTED. THE
MANY UNUSUAL RADAR CONTACTS OBSERVED MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN CAUSED
BY THE TEMPERATURE INVERSION AND THE GENERALLY POOR WEATHER
CONDITIONS PREVALENT IN THE LOCAL AREA DURING THE PERIOD OBJECTS WERE
OBSERVED. ITEM LIMA: NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE.

PREPARED BY INTELL STAFF OFFICER AND INTELL SPECL, 51FIW AFTER
INTERVIEW OF ALL AVAILABLE WITNESSES. AFTER OFFICIALINQUIRED
WERE MADE OF AIR UNITS, AWA, ETC. ASG TO OKI AND A QUIRY SENT TO
THE USS SHANGRI LA, ALL MILITARY ACFT WERE FOUND TO BE EITHER EVAC
FOR TYPHOON, OR ON THE GROUND. NO MIL ACFT OF ANY TYPE AIRBORNE.
THE OBSERVERS, THOUGH QUALIFIER, WERE NOT ABLE GOVE AN ANSWER
TO THE SIGHTING. IT IS FELT THAT THOSE OBJECTS WERE A RESULT OF
ELECTRICAL DISTURBANCES AND WEATHER PHENOMENA CAUSED BY TYPHOON
"SARAH". SPEEDS OF OBJECTS WERE REPORTED TO BE VARYING FR 50-100 KTS
PER HOUR. THE RADAR OPERATORS STATED THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED
BRIGHTER ON THE SCOPES THAN A T-33 ACFT WOULD. OBJECTS APPEARED ON
RADAR SCOPES AS EGG-SHAPED OR OBLONG AS IN NORMAL ACFT RETURN.
ITEM LIMA: EXISTENCE OF WRITTEN RETS BY OBSERVERS ARE ON FILE
