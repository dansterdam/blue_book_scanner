SUMMARY (Give condensed summary of report. Give disposition in final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part pg.)

This investigator has been unable to determine what was responsible for the sighting by Mrs. S. Pollard and Mrs. Dodd, who live in the McKeesport area. In view of the "Flying Saucer" reports received by this station, the usual scientific analysis of the phenomena cannot be made due to lack of data, which, with the proper combination of twilight and artificial illumination other unusual conditions, etc. I consider it very probable that this is a hoax.

12. None.

11. Captain Paul H. Wadsworth, Assistant Base Operations Officer: I received the report of this sighting at 1530 EST on 27 June 1957, and proceeded to contact Mrs. [name redacted] for an appointment. I interviewed Mrs. [name redacted] on 26 June 1957 and received the attached statement. I also interviewed Mrs. [name redacted], who had been present at the time. Mrs. [name redacted] believed that there was a natural explanation for the sighting. She did not wish to make a formal statement or to be involved in any way. She did concur with the statement made by Mrs. [name redacted]. Mrs. [name redacted] impressed me as being a reliable observer, although her interpretation of her observation might be open to doubt. She related her sighting to flying saucers she had seen in a defense-related magazine.

I then contacted the Ground Observer Corps but there was no record of a sighting by any of their members. Contact with Air Traffic Control revealed that the Greater Pittsburgh Control Tower had a report of Unidentified Flying Objects in the McKeesport area at about 2200 EST. Mr. [name redacted], who was in the control tower at the time stated that the only unusual blip on his radar scope was a target which he could not identify. He believed that the night haze been cause of some of the confusion.

Upon contacting Silvertrons, I received the report that they had investigated the report of the Greater Pittsburgh area and vectored Vanguard Target and Vanguard 11 to the scene. The pilots of these aircraft reported that they had not seen anything unusual.

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

I was sitting on the porch in back of the house. I glanced up and saw one round white object. It looked very unusual because it was large and round and I could see it clearly. It didn't look like anything I had ever seen before. I looked like what I had seen in the movie "UFO." I said jokingly "Look a flying saucer."

I stood up and saw two more in back of it and I became excited and said to my mother-in-law, "What are they?" I said this several times. My mother-in-law saw them and couldn't recognize them either.

She said she didn't know what they were. I ran out in the yard to get a picture but saw a rather large one of them. It was as red as lipstick. Then I saw a silver or metallic clean. That's what made me get so interested. Then I thought I'd better get a picture of them said I ran into the house for a camera. Then I came out they were still there but I couldn't get the camera focused. I dropped the camera because I wanted to keep watching them. Then we watched them until they were out of sight.

I was sure they weren't airplanes because I see many planes every day. I know what jets look like and I'm sure these weren't jets. I saw them very clearly and very sharply. They looked about the size of an orange or a grapefruit.
