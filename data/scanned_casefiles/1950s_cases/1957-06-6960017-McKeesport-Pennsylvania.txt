AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT

AREA REPORTED ON McKeesport Area, Pa.
SOURCE Mrs. ______
DATE OF INFORMATION 28 June 1957
FROM CL/473

FIGHTER SQ. (AD) (TAC) First Air Force, Pa.

DATE OF REPORT 1 July 1957

PREPARED BY Captain Paul M. Jacobs/Civilian (Print, underline proper acft. & applicable)
AFSN (SSN or service number if military)

ARM 230-02, AFR 200-7

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significant data in one concise paragraph. List enclosures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112a—Part (3))

This investigator has been unable to determine what was responsible for the sightings by Mrs. ______. Experience has shown that the area in which her. _______ lives is responsible for the majority of the "Flying Saucer" reports received by this station. The steel mills in the McKeesport area produce vast quantities of dust, which, with the proper combination of twilight and artificial illumination often produce peculiar sights.) I consider it very probable that this is what Mrs. Pollard and Mrs. Dodd saw.

11. Captain Paul E. Niedermohr, Assistant Base Operations Officer: I received the report of this sighting at 1530 EST on 27 June 1957, and proceeded to contact the various other departments. I interviewed Mrs. ----- on 25 June 1957 and received the attached statement. I also interviewed Mrs. ----- who had been sent to me by Mrs. ------. She believed that there was a natural explanation for the sighting. She did not wish to make a formal statement or to be involved in anyway. She did concur with the statement made by Mrs.------. Mrs. ------ impressed me as being a reliable observer although her interpretations of her observations might be open to doubt. She related her sighting to flying saucers she had seen in a science-fiction movie and said they were exactly alike.

           I then contacted the Ground Observer Corps but there was no record of a sighting by any of their members. Contact with Air Traffic Control revealed that the Greater Pittsburgh Control Tower had a report of Unidentified Flying Objects in the McKeesport area at about 2000 EST. Mr. ------, Airways Operations Supervisor, who was in the control tower at the time stated that the only unusual blip on his radar scope turned out to be an inbound B-47. He believed that this might have been the cause of some of the confusion. Upon contacting Silverstone, I received the report that they had investigated the report of the Greater Pittsburgh control tower and had vectored Vanguard Target and Vanguard II to the scene. The pilots of these aircraft reported that the lights from the steel mills in McKeesport area could have been responsible for the reports. S/Sgt Jerry Holshyne stated that he had worked the radar scope that night and had been unable to find anything unusual that night account for the reports. Contact with the Weather Bureau revealed that no weather balloons had been realised in the area at the times in question. This was reported by Mr. Robert Fulton, Observer at Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Weather Bureau.

3-I-A-L-e-z-S-I-M

I was sitting on the porch in back of the house. I glanced
up and saw one round white object. It looked very unusual because
it was large and round and I could see it clearly. It didn't look
like anything I had ever seen before. It looked like what I had
seen in the movie,"UFO". I said jokingly "Look a flying saucer."
I stood up ̵and saw two more in back of it and I become excited and
said to my mother-in-law, "What are they?" I said this several
times. My mother-in-law saw them and couldn't recognize them either.
She said she didn't know what they were. I ran out in the yard to
see them better and saw a reddish burst of light from one of them.
It was as red as lipstick. Then I saw a silver or metallic gleam.
That's what made me get so interested. Then I thought I'd better
get a picture of them and I ran into the house for a camera. When
I came out they were still there but I couldn't get the camera
focused. I dropped the camera because I wanted to keep watching
them. Then we watched them until they were out of sight.

I was sure they weren't airplanes because I see many planes
every day. I know what jets look like and I'm sure these weren't
jets. I saw them very clearly and very sharply. They looked about
the size of an orange or a grapefruit.
