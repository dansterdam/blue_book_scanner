SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

CTO Field Office No. 3, Chattanooga, Tennessee

DATE: 31 March 1950

SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCER REPORTED OVER CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE

On 28 March 1950, Mrs. [redacted] Park View Drive, Chattanooga, Tenn., and Mrs. [redacted] 616 Woodville Avenue, Chattanooga, Tennessee, reported to the Chattanooga News-Free Press that they had sighted a flying saucer over Chattanooga at about 1600, 28 March 1950. The story appeared in the News-Free Press on the evening of 29 March 1950. (p-6)

On 30 March 1950 both Mrs. [redacted] were interviewed and both stated that they had sighted a round silver object in the sky heading toward Lovell Field (Chattanooga Municipal Airport) and as they watched it suddenly disappeared. Neither lady could state how high the object was or at what rate of speed it was moving. They were only sure that it was round and was of a silver color. (p-2)

On 30 March 1950, Mr. [redacted], Meteorologist, Weather Bureau, Lovell Field, Chattanooga, Tennessee, was interviewed and stated that all probably that the ladies saw was the weather balloon that is released by the weather station at 1000 and 1600 each day to make weather observations. Mr. Kallquist stated that the ladies probably observed the balloon after its had reached a point where the ridge currents were blowing it back towards the field and also at the same moment when it reached the right altitude for it to burst due to the atmospheric pressure being less than that inside the balloon. (p-2)

No further investigation is contemplated by this office regarding this particular incident. Liaison has been set up with the local newspapers whereby any future reports of flying objects unidentified, will be relayed to this office immediately.
