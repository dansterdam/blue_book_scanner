Executive Officer,

Office of Information Services
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last year the Executive Officer very kindly, in reply to a request from me for information about certain "flying saucers" which appeared in 1952, sent me a copy of the "basic solution of the atmospheric pattern and the orbits of these bodies." This can be used in the solution of the atmospheric pattern and orbits of other objects.

This report over the section or section number is legible. I would like to request information on several specific incidents of sightings, the dates of which are as follows:

1958 April 26/27 Pennsylvania, Ohio
1958 July 4/5 North Carolina etc.
1958 September 30 South Carolina etc.
1958 Dec. 31/Jan 1 New York, New Jersey etc.
1959 Feb. 10/11 South Carolina etc.

If you would be good enough to send me information dealing with these incidents, I would be greatly obliged.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature Redacted]
