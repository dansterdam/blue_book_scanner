1. In answer to a request by [redacted], the following information is submitted:

a. 20 April 1959, 2019 EST - The aircraft at 9000 feet altitude, sighted by 2019 USN 50th CG degrees 15'N, east of Mooresville, Georgia, sighted the following object moving in a westerly direction at a perpendicular the altitude. Object had a trail smaller than the diameter of the jet, pink, then came to a hover. Sighted from a point northwest toward the aircraft was like a meteor, medium southeast. Object was between two markers on a course, Georgia, N. Y., 6015 NE - A long. The glow just disappeared. Object in view for four seconds.

b. 5 July 1959, 0105 EST - At 31 degrees 50'N, 71 degrees 29'W, on course 045 degrees, 31,000 feet altitude to the Atlantic, an object was observed on and one-half to two miles ahead of aircraft, object was a large at this altitude, leaving a long, or 11 or more. It about 500 feet, object was dark red, green, with a trail of fire. Altitude was between 30,000 and 32,000 feet. This was object 50'N, 70 degrees 30'W, three other sightings, etc.

c. 14 December 1959, Yorktown, N. Y., 6015 NE - A large meteor was observed, color of dull white, traveling in a continuous direction. The color was white, with a tail about as long as the distance from horizon to horizon. The meteor was in view for approximately one second.

d. 14 December 1959, east of Fishers, N. Y., 6015 NE - A brilliant light, yellow, slightly larger than a meteor, with a small area brighter than longer than object, was observed at a great height. It moved from southeast to northwest. Duration was seconds.

FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES

1959 July 30

Executive Officer,
Public Information Division
Office of Information Service
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last year the Executive Officer very kindly, in reply to a request from so for information about certain fireballs which appeared in 1957, sent me a considerable amount of useful information, which can be used in the solution of the astronomical path and orbits of these bodies.

During the past year or so a large number of fireballs have appeared over the eastern or south eastern states, and in the case of the five to be mentioned, I have been able to assemble a number of observations. But despite this I find it important to urge you to send me copies of any or all reports in your hands, dealing with these bodies.

I may add the Hydrographic Office of the U.S.Navy has for over 30 years effectively cooperated in such work and as a consequence it has been possible to solve for many important fireballs. Such cooperation from your office, as a routine matter, would also be invaluable.

The specific bodies I now request information on are:

1958 April 20/21 Southeastern States       8.2.0 pm Nit. 20
1958 July 4/5    North Carolina etc.        1 h am July 5
1958 Nov. 30     South Carolina etc.        6.10 pm Nov.30
1958 Dec. 13/14  New York, New Jersey etc.  12.32 am Dec.14
1959 Dec. 20/21  South Carolina etc.        4.15 am Dec.21

It would be a great favor to me and useful to science if you would be good enough to send me observations dealing with these fireballs.

Very sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
Narberth, Pa.
