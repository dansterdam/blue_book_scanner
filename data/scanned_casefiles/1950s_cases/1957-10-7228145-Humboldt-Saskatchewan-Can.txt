11. COMMENTS
Although this sighting occurred in late 1957, it was not rptd until late 1961. The information reported is limited in nature, and due to the age of the sighting, it is impractical to attempt to gather further information. It is possible that the object was a meteor, but due to limited information, a valid conclusion cannot be made.
