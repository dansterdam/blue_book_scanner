at him from 11 o'clock, at very high speed, thinking this flame to come
from the exhaust of a jet aircraft, without running lights showing, Lt.
Hahn pulled his C-47 sharply up to 1 o'clock. Looking back to see whether
the flame had passed under he noticed that it had completely disappeared.
Neither co-pilot or engineer had noticed anything.
