26 May 1953

STATEMENT

At 0145 we five airmen, Dean McDonald, Vittorio Settimi, Paul Ryan, Thomas De Stefano, and Thomas Sfinas were just making the turn off the main highway towards Ramore at the White Rose Gas Station when Vic Settimi mentioned he noticed two lights up on the hill. I said there should only be one. So we stopped the car at the corner and watched the light. Suddenly the light which seemed about the size of a softball began to move in towards the site. At the time it was to the left of the site at about 20 to 30 miles. We watched it move in towards the site then we started for the main gate around 0120 and at that time the light seemed to hang directly over the 3-D set. We let Paul Ryan off at the barracks and then started up the hill to see if everything was all right. As we started up the hill the light began to move to the right of the site and as we approached nearer to the object it appeared to have a slight orange glow at the base of it. As we drew nearer it must have moved away nearly 50 or 60 miles to the right and it seemed to be traveling around 1500 miles an hour. After it traveled that far it started climbing straight up and disappeared into the clouds and leaving a small indication where it broke the cloud.

STATEMENT

Between 0415 and 0430 on the morning of the twenty fifth day of May 1953 I was returning to the base with four other men. A/3C McDowell, A/3C Battani, A/3C Simas, and A/3C De Stefano. We noticed there was a light in the sky that we had never seen before. When I first saw it, it was about two hundred yards to the left of the site. I didn't think too much of it. I thought it was just a star. Then we got to the main gate A/3C Simas suggested that we stop near car and watch it to see if it was moving. At that time it appeared to be only a few feet to the left of the light of the Power Plant. While we watched it move to a position on top of the light at the Power Plant. The rest of the men decided to go up on the hill for a better look. I went to bed.

The men were approaching the base in an automobile from the west and about 5 miles from the hill around which the object seemed to hover. The object seemed to hover over the hilltop from the north slowly - then seemed to hover over the hill. Radar set (A/FPS-3) is being installed on hill and an AN/TPS-1D that is being used as lashup equipment was not operational due to FOE.

The men drove their car towards the hill and the object began moving away at increased speed towards the SE. As the men arrived on the hill the object was about fifty (50) miles away and going into a rapid stop, a climb through the overcast. The object made no noise and was not heard by any of the airmen on duty on the hill. It had a definite shape and did not appear reasons.

Only one of the men reported seeing or noticing any trail behind it when it moved. All five reported that when it went through the overcast it left a break in the cloud-walling if, the break had a glare to it. The men stopped their car frequently to observe the object so that its motion was observed from the car in motion as well as at rest.

b. The time of initial sighting was 0115 Eastern Daylight Saving Time and the object was observed for about twenty (20) minutes.

c. The object was observed visually from the surface.

d. At time of sighting the airmen were close to the town of Ramore in Ontario, Canada and the object seemed to be about five miles to the Northeast. The object hovered over a hilltop elevation about 1300 feet and then moved rapidly to the Southeast as the men approached the hilltop.

STATEMENT                                                26 May 1953

On our way back to the base on the morning of May 24, 1953 about 0430 in the morning, Airman Gotfini called to our attention an orange colored object in the form of a softball moving; steadily towards the top of the hill. We kept on watching the strange object move at a steady pace all the way up till we reached the main gate. There he asked the airman on duty if he had noticed the same object, but he hadn't.

After passing through the gate we paused for a few minutes to watch, and see if we could still see the object, which by this time we moved up to the top of the hill to see if we could get a close look at the object, but it was far off by the time we got to the top of the hill. No stopped the car and watched into the dark clouds. We waited awhile to see if it would come out of the clouds again but it didn't so we left and reported it to the Commanding Officer.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0415, 25 May 1953, I Airmen and myself were returning from a trip to Kirkland Lake. When turning onto the road near the White Rose Service Station in Ramore I saw a Orange colored object about 1 mile left of the Radar Tower. I called attention to it and the other 1 airmen agreed that it was not a tower light or a star but some unknown object. We stopped once in town and the object started to rise and move toward the Radar Tower. We drove up to the Base Gate (always keeping our eyes on the object) when we were not obstructed by trees and stopped again. By this time the object appeared to be right on the Radar Tower. We informed the A.P. at the gate about it and then proceeded to the Radar Tower. As we started up toward the hill the object started to go away from the Radar Tower, then we arrived on the hill the object disappeared into the clouds. We checked with the personnel on the hill and they said they had not seen it.
