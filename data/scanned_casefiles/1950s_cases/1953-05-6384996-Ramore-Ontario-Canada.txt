STATEMENT

At 0415 we five airman, Dean McDonald, Vittoria Battini, Paul Ryan, Thomas McLaughlin, and Thomas Griffin were just making the turn off the main highway towards Ramore. At the mile post 69 station when the moonlight illuminated two objects hovering up and down. At first we watched the light. Suddenly the light which seemed about the size of a softball began to move in towards the site. At the same time it was to the left of the site at about 20 to 30 miles. It watched it move in towards the site. According to the time it takes, for the light to move from where we first observed it to the spot it ended up it must have been traveling at terrific speed. We last Paul Ryan off at the barracks and then started up the hill. As we started up the hill the light began to move to the right of the site and as it approached the light became dimmer and disappeared into the clouds and leaving a small indication where it broke through the clouds.

STATEMENT

Between 0415 and 0430 on the morning of the twenty fifth day of May 1953 I was returning to the base with four other men. A/3C Radford, A/2C Smith, and A/2C Benson. We noticed a light that seemed to be on a collision course with us. As we first saw it, it was about 1 thousand yards to the left of the site. I didn't think it was much of it. It thought it was just a star. But as it came closer, it took the shape of a round object, maybe 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It seemed to be oscillating or wobbling as it moved. As it got to the main gate A/1C Sirins saw it just over the trees. He seemed to be apprehensive and asked if anyone else saw it. We all saw it and were amazed. It appeared to be very high and seemed to be only about 100 yards away. As it got closer to the Power Plant, the object seemed to move to a position on top of the light at the Power Plant. The men decided to go up on the hill to get a better look. I went to tell someone. I went to bed.

1. Due to the non-availability at this organization of AF Form 112 "Air Intelligence Information Report", the expanded written report on this initial telephonic message 20 May 1953 is being submitted in letter form.

2. As reported by five (5) airmen observed the unidentified object:

(1) Was round and orange colored, relative size - much smaller than the size of the full moon at full, and appeared to be approaching the base in an automobile from the west, and about 5 miles from the hill around which the object seemed to hover. The object approached the hill from the north slowly, a wing seemed to move slightly, and it was thought to be some kind of a machine. It was being observed through binoculars installed on hill and an AF-type-6 that is being used as a listening post, was not operational due to repairs.

(3) The five airmen drove their car towards the hill and the object appeared to remain stationary, hovering on the hill. The object was about fifty (50) miles and only into a climb observed. It did not appear to make any noise and seemed to hover on the hill. It did not appear to be controlled by any of the airmen on duty on the hill. It had a definite shape to it and did not appear to be fuzzy.

Ltr., 912th Air Force Sqdn., OPS 31.9.1, Subj: FLYOBT, dtd 26 May 53 (Contd.)

Only one of the men reported seeing or noticing any trail behind the object as it moved. All five reported that the object went through the overcast. It left a clear spot in the overcast where it had been. The men stopped their car frequently to observe the object as what they described was observed from the car in motion as they were proceeding along the road.

b. The time of initial sighting was 0915 Eastern Daylight Saving Time and the object was observed for about twenty (20) minutes.

c. The object was observed visually from the surface.

d. At time of sighting the airmen were close to the town of Ramore in Ontario, Canada, and the object seemed to be about five miles to the northeast toward the milling operations about one-third the distance up the hillside.

e. The object was sighted by the following named airmen:
(1) Thomas G. Grimes, A/1C, AF 31 131 692
(2) Vittorio D. Serturini, A/2C, AF 12 273 979
(3) Thomas J. De Stefano, A/1C, AF 13 110 953
(4) Dean F. Mc Donald, A/1C, AF 12 391 263
(5) Paul H. Ryan Jr., A/1C, AF 12 327 217

All five are considered reliable and they were in a stable state. For all of them it was their first experience with such an object.
The weather at the time was clear and there were no surface winds. The condition of winds aloft is unknown.

This organization has no information as to any activity or condition meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

STATEMENT
On our way back to the base on the morning of May 21, 1953 about 0430 in the morning this object was following close to our car along the top of the hill. We kept on watching the strange object move along at a steady pace all the way up to the top of the hill. We asked the airman on duty if he had noticed the same object, but he hadn't. In fact when we brought the object to the attention of the Command we were pointed for a new incident, as far as they were concerned.
We raced up to the top of the hill to see if we could get a closer look at the object, but it was too far off of the top of the hill for us to get a good look at it. As we stopped the car and got our glasses to take a closer look, the object disappeared into the dark clouds. We waited while to see if it would come out of the clouds again, but it didn't so we reported it to the Commanding Officer.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0415, 25 May 1953, 4 airman and myself were returning from a trip to the radar station in Ramore. As we were turning onto the road under the control of the Ramore Service Station, a call was called attention to it and the other 4 airman agreed that it was not a tower light or a star with some unusual coloring. The object appeared to be low on the horizon and the object started to move and move toward the radar tower. We drove up to the base gate (already stopping near the object). As we arrived the object started to go away from the radar tower. We informed the A.D. at the gate about it and then proceeded to the radar tower. As we turned up toward the hill, the object started to go away from the radar tower, when we arrived on the radar tower the object disappeared into the clouds.
