2000-2500 BROKEN. WEATHER PEOPLE HERE ADVISE THEY BELIEVE LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE TOO STABLE DURING THIS PERIOD TO PRODUCE LIGHTNING OR THUNDER. NO AIRCRAFT WERE IN THIS AREA THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THESE SIGHTINGS. NO REPORTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED OF ANY OBJECT LANDING ON THE GROUND IN THIS AREA THAT COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATION PIG IRON. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF REPORTS, IT IS BELIEVED THAT SUCH A PHENOMENA DID OCCUR, HOWEVER, WE HAVE NO INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW EVALUATION OF THESE REPORTS AT THIS LEVEL.
