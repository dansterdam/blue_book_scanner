REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS

1. At approximately 1920 hours on 7 November 1956, the ELTORO MC AS radar van operator reported to the tower that he had picked up several unidentified targets on his radar scope. These targets were flying at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet and at a speed of approximately 600 mph. The radar operator reported that the targets were being picked up on several scopes and that the scope presentations were typical of those received on airborne radar contacts.

2. The tower operators confirmed the radar reports and observed the scope presentations. They reported that the targets were traveling at high speed and exhibited radical changes in direction. The targets were observed for approximately 15 minutes.

3. Aircraft from ELTORO MC AS were scrambled to investigate the targets, but they were unable to make visual contact. The radar contact was lost after approximately 15 minutes.

4. This incident was reported to the 4517th AISS at ELTORO MC AS and a full investigation was initiated.

The image contains eight black-and-white photographic images, each showing a circular shape with a bright center against a dark background. These appear to be radar target images or other visual representations of unidentified aerial phenomena captured as part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official investigation of UFO sightings.

From: 1st Lt Robert M. Olsson, ADC, 4517th Air Base Squadron, El Toro MCAS, California
Subject: Unidentified Object Sighted at El Toro MCAS, California, 7 November 1956
1. At approximately 2145 hours, 7 November 1956, the radar operator at the El Toro MCAS Control Tower observed an unidentified object on the radar scope. The object was traveling in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of 600-700 knots. The object was tracked for approximately 10 minutes before it faded from the radar screen.
2. The radar operator immediately notified the Officer of the Day, 1st Lt Robert M. Olsson, ADC, 4517th Air Base Squadron, who then contacted the 4th Fighter Interceptor Squadron on alert at El Toro MCAS. Two F-86D aircraft were scrambled to intercept the unidentified object, but were unable to establish visual or radar contact.
3. Four radar scope photographs of the unidentified object were taken by the radar operator during the tracking period. These photographs are attached.
4. No explanation for the unidentified object has been determined. This incident is being reported in accordance with Air Force Regulation 200-2.

1. On 7 November 1956, at 1725 hours, the control tower operator at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, California, observed five unidentified aerial objects on the radarscope. 
2. The objects were first detected at a distance of 20 miles from the station and were observed to be traveling at a speed of 300-400 knots at an altitude of 15,000-20,000 feet.
3. The objects were observed on the radarscope for a period of approximately 15 minutes, during which time they exhibited a high degree of maneuverability, making several abrupt changes in speed and direction.
4. No visual sightings of the objects were made by the control tower personnel.
5. The incident was reported to higher headquarters and the Air Force was notified.
