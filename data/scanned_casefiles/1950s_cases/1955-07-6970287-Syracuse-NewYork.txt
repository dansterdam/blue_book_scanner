    Two (2) objects, round, red and green, appeared to change colors and were purportedly larger than navigational lights.

10. COMMENTS
    The flashing red and green lights suggest the possibility of aircraft. The local CGC plotted two a/c in the area of sighting at the time of the sighting. In all probability the observers saw the aircraft plotted by the CGC.
