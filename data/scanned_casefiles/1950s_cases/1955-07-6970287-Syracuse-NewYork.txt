Two (2) objects, round, red and green, appeared     The flashing red and green lights sug-
to change colors and were purportedly larger        gest the possibility of aircraft.The 
than navigational lights.                           local GOC plotted two a/c in the area

                                                    In all probability the observers saw the 
                                                    aircraft plotted by the GOC.
