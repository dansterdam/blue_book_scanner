AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States
LOCATION: New Mexico (ON-7347)
DATE OF INFORMATION: 03 May 1953
SOURCE: Night ACGW Supplemental AFB, Texas A-3
TYPE OF REPORT: Air Radar & CAA

SUMMARY:

1. An unidentified track (UGL) containing five (5) or more aircraft at an estimated altitude of 35,000 Ft. on course and track was picked up at DNJOIS heading North. This target containing three (3) or more aircraft, was in loose contact, AB 1526 contact was made at DLN1930 with track number M2 and at 1935G contact was made at DLN 1005 with track number M3. None of those targets, though quick large in size, appeared to be making any directional progress, but rather seemed to stay in a definite orbit as if in the process of grouping.

2. First track was sighted at 0843 CST, 23 May 1953. At 0907 CST the second track was sighted. Third track was sighted 0926 CST. Number four track was sighted at same time of number three track. Number five track was sighted at 0929 CST.

3. 7th1st ACGW Sq, Lackland AFB, Texas.

4. AI/FTG-3 Radar Unit.

5. Trained Air Force Personnel. Controllers, Captain Ralph S. Hoggatt, GWO Edwin B. Robinson, Sr. Radar Operator, Ray E. Duncan, AEC.

6. Weather at the time: Hot, Cloud Condition 3,000 Ft. Scattered Winds, 20 Knots, 200° at 40,000 Ft. Temperature Inversion (Not Def).

7. None.

8. Photographs were taken with scope cameras. Development of film revealed camera mal-function.

9. None due to possible border violation.

10. San Antonio ARTCC was immediately contacted by commercial telephone for possible identification. ARTCC advised that Del Rio had no aircraft in that area and that Laredo had a flight of aircraft whose mission was to make touch-and-go-landings at Eagle Pass, Texas, however, they should not be in the questioned area.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Country: Mexico

Area Reported: Mexico City, Mexico
Date of Report: 26 Aug 1953
Date of Information: 25 August 1953
Prepared by (title): Major Sigurd L. Jensen, Jr., Asst Air Attaché
Source: General
Evaluation: B-2

SUMMARY:

1. The following is in response to CWL-TIG-5111 dated 4 August 1953.

2. On 25 August, the writer, on a periodic visit to Mexican Air Force headquarters, engaged in conversation with General Mexican Air Force.

3. During the conversation, it was learned the MAF, in cooperation with the Secretariat of Agriculture, sent a number of F-47 type aircraft with MAF pilots to the National Area of Mexico to engage in a cloud seeding to promote rainfall. The aircraft were operating in that region during the time of the reported observation. It is felt, therefore, that object observed could have been these aircraft operating at altitude in cloud seeding operations.

The image appears to be a technical document with a grid chart and some tables. However, most of the text is too illegible to read clearly due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The only partially readable text I can make out includes some numbers and grid markings like:

-30°
-20°
13 Km
12 Km

8 Km

There are some tables on the right side of the document, but the text within them is not legible enough to transcribe accurately.

The document appears to be a data table with multiple columns and rows. The columns seem to include headers like "Procedure", "Temperature", and other partially legible labels. The left side of the document contains a grid with numerical scales from 0 to 500, with increments marked. The bottom of the document shows distance markers from 13 Km to 5 Km. Much of the text within the table cells is difficult to read clearly due to the image quality. Some text at the bottom of the table mentions "Could Missile" but the rest is not legible. The document looks like a technical or scientific data recording sheet, possibly related to meteorological or scientific measurements.

The rest of the document appears to be a grid chart with numerical values along the left and bottom margins, but the specific numbers are difficult to read clearly due to the image quality. The chart seems to be some kind of scientific or meteorological data visualization.

This appears to be a data recording sheet with multiple columns and rows. The columns seem to include headers for:

- Pressure
- Temperature
- Significant Levels
- Humidity
- Other data points

The document has a grid-like structure with numerical scales on the left side ranging from 30 to 300, likely representing altitude or depth measurements.

Most of the text in the cells is difficult to read clearly due to the image quality, appearing blurry and faded. Some numbers and entries are visible but not consistently legible across the entire document.

At the bottom of the document, there are some additional text entries, but they are also not clearly readable.

The document appears to be a scientific or meteorological data recording sheet, possibly from a weather balloon or atmospheric research mission, dated from the 1950s based on the filename context.

The image appears to be an atmospheric chart or graph with a grid layout. At the top right, there is partially visible text that reads "ARAEDTIC CHART" (though the first word might be slightly misread). The chart has vertical and horizontal grid lines with numerical scales on the left side ranging from around 50 to 1050, and horizontal scales at the bottom showing different kilometer measurements. The document looks like a technical meteorological or scientific reference chart from the 1950s, printed in black and white with a somewhat faded or aged appearance.

The image appears to be a complex meteorological or atmospheric data chart with a grid system. On the left side, there is a vertical axis with numerical markings from 400 to 700, and a grid overlay. The top left corner shows "WEATHER BUREAU" partially visible. The document seems to be a detailed data recording sheet with multiple columns and rows of numerical entries. Much of the specific text is difficult to read clearly due to the image quality, but it looks like a scientific or meteorological recording document with precise measurements and notations.


- page 20 -

The image appears to be a grid or chart with numerical values along the vertical and horizontal axes. The vertical axis shows values from 200 to 100, and the horizontal axis shows distances from 24 Km to 16 Km. At the bottom left, there is a location noted as "SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS". The document seems to be a technical or scientific graph, but due to the low contrast and image quality, many of the specific details and notations are difficult to read clearly.
