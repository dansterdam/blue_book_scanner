SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Use additional paragraphs if needed. Begin text of report on line left.)

Mr. [redacted] of Lancaster, N.D.C., Pa., reported seeing an unidentified flying object at approximately 2100EST on 1 February 1953 while near Quarryville, Pa. (3965N/7612 W). An interview with the observer revealed the following account of the sighting:

Mr. [redacted] attention was attracted to an orange-red, pulsating light, approximately twenty-five degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be elliptical in shape but did not seem to have any measurable diameter. Then first seen the light was very bright in the sky to the west. After approximately ten minutes, it began to move toward the horizon, reversed its direction to climb upward and then moved slowly toward the horizon again, diminishing in brightness as it descended. Finally it disappeared. It was visible for approximately twenty minutes.

The observer stated that he heard no sound and that no exhaust or trail was visible. He stated that the light was brighter than any of the stars near it. He explained that he had observed many aircraft at night and this light was not resembling either normal navigation lights or landing lights.

Weather at the time of the observation was clear with 15 miles visibility.

Three other witnesses observed this object, but could not add anything to Mr. [redacted] description. One was told that he had seen three other similar objects within the "last few weeks" in the same part of the sky, but had not reported them.

Mr. [redacted] is a farmer with a high school education. He stated he has often looked for "flying saucers" and although he had seen two others during the summer, he had not previously reported any.

This office can offer no explanation for this sighting. There are no airports or any known areas in this area of operation. A review of the character of the observer would also indicate that aircraft were not responsible for this or the previous similar sightings. The motion and brightness of the object also eliminate the possibility of ordinary astronomical phenomena.
