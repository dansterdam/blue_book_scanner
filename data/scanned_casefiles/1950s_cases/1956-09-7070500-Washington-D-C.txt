one

w/vertical motions

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One round red-tinted obj, about size of pen at arm's length. Obj was sighted at 90 dgr azimuth & about 15 dgr elevation. Object moved with vertical motions. Object was observed visually for twenty minutes & was still in sight at time of initial rpt.

11. COMMENTS
Sighting probably caused by Mars seen through a temperature inversion. Although azimuth & elevation do not correlate exactly w/hypothesis, shape, size, color, general direction of sighting, duration of sighting, and fact that Mars was clearly visible in otherwise starless sky tends to support this conclusion.
