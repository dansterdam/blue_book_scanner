RE: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER GUAM SEPTEMBER 12, 1950:
DAVID HUGH S. BENNETT - USAF INFORMANT

Dear Colonel Farrell:

My letter dated January 21, 1950, advised you I had some information to report. This information is now being forwarded. I advised an agent of this office that in September, 1950 near Agana, Guam, he observed an unidentified object flying over the shore of this island. He stated it appeared to be a disc, and about 600 feet in the air, and no sound was heard. The object was luminous and about a mile from the observer. He stated that a white cloud covered part of the object and he watched it disappear in the cloud. He stated he does not know whether the cloud formed from the flying object or whether the cloud was already there.

Furnished herewith is a sketch drawn up on March 13, 1950, while awaiting an interview with the FBI representative."

Mr. President - 
I feel that if I were questioned by competent scientists I could give more information on the type of unknown objects I have sighted which I know from experience must be outer space craft. My life's experience is not very long and times awaitin'

Sincerely,
Dallas

C. THE OBJECT 600-1000 FEET IN DIAMETER WAS ILLUMINATED WITHIN AND CONTAINED MANY DARK AREAS SHAPED LIKE WINDOWS AND ENTRY-EXITS
D. ATTEMPTS OF AIR FORCE PERSONNEL TO LOCATE THE OBJECT WERE FRUITLESS. TWO YEARS OF INVESTIGATION OF THESE REPORTS HAVE YIELDED NOTHING CONCLUSIVE
E. FLIGHT INDICATED ONLY THAT IT MAINTAINED A CONSTANT COURSE AT VARYING SPEEDS WHICH EXCEED PRESENT JET ENGINED AIRCRAFT
F. BASED ON NUMEROUS EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AND EXACT MEASUREMENTS WHICH COULD BE DETERMINED, WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THESE SIGHTINGS REPRESENT SOMETHING OF AN ORDER COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR TO PRESENT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

This is one of the many reports submitted by Mr. [redacted] to the Air Force. Cannot comment on Mr. [redacted]'s insistence that a particular saucer has been following him for some distance (B) indicating it was seen in 1950; his original report of file, which caught up with him in a balloon where it knocked him out with its bright lights and then disks were seen hovering 360 degrees around his aircraft, but harmless. Believable as a Source is obvious, but hazardous to be considered a technical viewpoint, and reasons why such analysis can be initiated.

Dear Mr. Boyle,

The 2h January 1958 report by Mr. concerning an unidentified flying object seen on Guam in September 1950 has been referred to this office for reply.

There are no reports from Guam of UFO's in September 1950. Also, no object of this reported size would have been seen by many persons or have been observed by radar. There are no other reports concerning this object.

Sincerely,

April 21-59

Dear Sir - 

It might interest you to know that since the Guam sighting I have been shown still more about saucers that I did not know and thought that I was suffering from some physical debility.  As the incident in the park had caused  the same results (momentary blackout) I now know the real source.

On one occasion on Guam my car was completely off the road when I passed out; the occupants of a nearby car saw the ship - a gigantic ball of light - hovering over my car.  Boss E. A. Fitzgerald of Denver, Col. and he can verify the above statement.  

After this incident they reverted back to the weaker shots so I doubt that they were trying to do us any harm.  The only disconcerting thing about the ones who were extremely brilliant is that it would be coincidence.

I believe that these "people" are here on a friendly exploration - observation trip and will not leave without contacting us and establishing some sort of relationship. If they are actually highly and bent on conquest they will not want to contact us until the fire-works begin.  The only thig to astound their motives is to establish contact - and I suggest..

They know me and know that I am conditioned to the fact that they exist therefore I suggest that the Alaskan episode I will try for a complete contact.  I chose this because he appears to be a good chap and the situation and also because he lives close to the scene but I will certainly be in touch with whomever I can relay information - if I get any.

I shudder when I think of what will happen if we do not attempt this contact and the harassment be continued in matter one.  Their leaders know as well as we that "these people" exist.  At present we have the advantage but I "suggest" that these people could assist us in alleviating some of the economic problems will probably take over the other all part of the globe.

In closing I might say that nothing will be accomplished with you hiding under the bed and me approaching with defeatism to you.  The security of the country is in danger and the situation calls for direct and positive action.

Sincerely,

/s/ [Redacted]

COMMENTS:(Use reverse if necessary)

1. The enclosed correspondence is the latest of many contacts which the Air Force has had with Mr. *****. This individual has submitted letters and reports to the Air Force since 1950. This person has been concerned with a space craft which has been following him around.

2. The contents of the source are as follows:

a. The so-called flying saucer has been following him around since 1950.
b. The so-called flying saucers are inhabited.
c. The weapon used by these space travelers is a "stunning ray" of some type which renders one helpless when fired.
d. That for some unknown reason they have selected him (Mr. *****) as a contact or guinea pig, and have stunned him with the ray some 50 times.
e. It appears that this source is either perpetrating a hoax for a joke or a more underhand reason, or is a paranoiac in need of medical care.

5. The ATIC conclusion is that this report and the previous claims of Mr. ***** are hoaxes.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr.

Your letter of 21 April addressed to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has been referred to this office to reply.

I am sure that you are aware that the U.S. Air Force is charged with the responsibility of investigating and analyzing all cases of unidentified flying objects. Further, as you know, the policy of the Air Force is to inform the public of the findings of this program.

To date the Air Force has, in our investigation of many cases, uncovered no physical evidence which would indicate the presence of any extra-terrestrial, physical, and/or intelligent sources nor has there been any evidence that unidentified flying objects constitute a threat or danger to the national security of the United States.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheets on this subject. They plainly state the Air Force position on this matter.
