REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

FILE NO: (PL-5) 10
DATE: 17 February 1950

TITLE: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT
27 January 1950, at 1715 hours EST
Observed near Marylands Road,
Scullville, New Jersey

REPORT BY: S/A ERNEST H. HUBBARD
HOME OFFICE: 17th DO. Kirtland Air Force Base
PERIOD: 16 February 1950
PLACE OF ORIGIN: 17th DO. Kirtland Air Force Base

CHARACTER: SPECIAL INQUIRY
STATUS: CLOSED

REFERENCES: None. This is an initial report.

Investigation predicated upon receipt of letter from Mr. [redacted], dated 27 January 1950, at Scullville, New Jersey. [redacted] advised that on 27 January 1950, he observed a white streak traveling through the sky, and after traveling a distance of approximately one-half hour, and its speed was about one half of a fire works rocket at close range. The phenomena appeared to be ascending at about a sixty (60) degree angle. This phenomena had all appearances and indications of a vapor trail. In that there is but one sighting, and the information available concerning this sighting does not contain the necessary technical data required, it is not considered advisable to expend further time toward the investigation of this phenomena.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation is predicated upon receipt of letter from Mr. [redacted] Maryland Road, Scullville, New Jersey, dated 27 January 1950. Mr. [redacted] advised he saw a white streak travel-ing northward through the clouds, and after traveling some distance it turned black and went into a sort of zig zag motion until it dis-appeared.

AT KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE, NEW MEXICO

2. In a letter, dated 27 January 1950, at Scullville, New Jersey, addressed to the Assistant Air Maneuver Observer, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Mr. [redacted] advised that while returning to his home in Scullville, New Jersey from work in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on 27 January 1950, at approximately 1715 hours EST, he observed a phenomena in the southwest sky which lasted for about half an hour. This phenomena was a white streak traveling northwest through and above the clouds. After traveling some distance it turned black and went into a sort of zig zag motion until it disappeared, either suddenly or ran out as a cloud, but faded gradually. The speed was about half of that of a fire works rocket at close range. The phenomena appeared to be ascending at about a sixty (60) degree angle.

3. This phenomena has all the appearances and indications of a vapor trail made by high flying aircraft. This is but a single sighting, and the lapse of time between sighting and transmittal of information through regular channels, it is not considered advisable to expend any further time on this matter. Further, technical authorities have advised it is positively necessary to have more than one (1) sighting, and that these sightings must of necessity contain a high degree of exactness in technical data required in order to obtain a triangular "fix" upon the object and its path of travel.
