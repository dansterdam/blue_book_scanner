Bright glowing red obj moving at a speed almost as fast as shooting a star. Later a mass of very small lights, white as the stars, but smaller, appeared with the red obj moving clockwise within the mass of small lights.

11. COMMENTS
The cause for this sighting is probably aberration of the light from the star arcturus by the window screen, coupled with normal pulsating.

12. CONCLUSIONS

☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft

DATE: 1/20/1959

I was looking at a clear sky and noticed the brightness of the stars. So I opened the window and noticed the sky looked like a narrow mirror. The stars were more distinct than clear. Common, so as I was sitting head on the window sill I was in a position to see the South Western sky from the house, gave to the horizon. Then a bright glowing red object moved from about my place almost Southwest of me, at a speed that I could see was slow.

Major Lawrence J. Thacker
USAF Executive Officer of Information Services
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Dear Major Thacker:-

After mailing the questionnaire on yesterdays mail I thought of an omission that might be of vast importance in establishing the distance and size of the objects.

The star ( which I first thought to be the Commandent of the group) being largely when first seen was about one half the radius from the West rim and center of the circle of lights, then in close to three three minutes ( wish I could be more precise on time ) it had moved to the center of cluster ; Then after much thought I came up with a formula that I suppose you use daily.

In addition to the angular calculations from a given point on the earth, let us assume that we are on the star trained on a given point on the earth and noting the distance said point moved with the rotation of the earth which we know to be about 16-miles per minute. Then in three minutes of time the distance from the center of cluster to point that star was first seen would be 43 X 16 = 48 miles from center/point star was first seen to center/point 3 1/2 radius, Then the diameter of circular cluster would be 4 X 48 or 192 miles minus projection, about 5 degrees triangulation from viewing point. Oh:hand this to the mathematician its too much for me.

Let us say the projection ratio on three degrees is 20 : 1 then the distance to object would be 20 X 200 = 4000 miles.

Then as to speed: If 3 degrees = 4000 miles and the object traveled say 21 degrees in 2 minutes or less the speed would be the ratio of 2V50r 7 and V X 4000 = 24,000 + 2 = 14,000 miles per Min.

Now let me quote from a ten verse poem I composed in 1916
- There'll be new methods of flying not with our crude machine,
In o'ercoming gravity the science will convene:
It may be a chemists compound that gravity will repel;
What-e'er the unknown power we'll wait for time to tell.

Now let us change the last two lines to read:
It may be an electro ray that will nullify all weight:
Then will all airborn craft be truly out of date.

Then assuming some supper intelligent being way out in space has really accomplished the feat: Weightlessness multiplied by a million Gs. would still be weightless and a man without weight would suffer no ill effects by such a tremendous rate of acceleration.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

This image appears to be a star chart or celestial map with a circular grid pattern. The chart is divided into sections with various astronomical labels such as:

- Telescopium
- Ara
- Norma
- Corona
- December
- January

The chart has concentric circles and radial lines, with numerous small dots representing stars or celestial objects. There are handwritten notes and markings on the chart, though some are difficult to read clearly.

On the left side of the image, there are zodiac signs visible, including:
- Gemini
- Libra
- Taurus

The chart seems to be a detailed astronomical reference showing the positions of stars and constellations in a specific region of the sky.

This image appears to be a detailed road map of the southwestern United States, specifically covering Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Mexico. The map shows numerous highways, city names, and state boundaries. Highway numbers like 82, 280, 380, 84, and others are visible. Major cities and regions such as Chihuahua, El Paso, Casa Grande, and various other locations are labeled. The map is in black and white and appears to be from an older era, likely from the 1950s based on the context provided. The map includes latitude and longitude markings along the bottom and sides of the image.

Commander In Chief  U. S. A. &.
Washington, 25, D. C.

Dear Commander:-

An unidentifiable object appeared in the sky Feb. 16. at about 5:40 A.M. Which was traveling South by a few degrees East and stopped by the star ( γ ) in VERGO; THEN there appeared a mass of small lights around it and it had an ability to move clock-wise among the lights in an erratic course about one-third the radius from the outer rim of the circular mass of lights, then after completing about 7/8 of a circle it moved to the center of the mass and came to rest with its North side almost touching the star, then I failed to see the small lights they seemed to vanish all at the same time, then the main object seemed to change its design; the length seemed to change to its depth and in less than 15 seconds it grew so small that it was invisible, as tho vanishing in the distance.

The object was about two times longer than its width and its depth appeared to be two-thirds of its width; with all corners rounded, shining with a neonish red glow.

That you might be interested or help me contact someone who is. Yours truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]
