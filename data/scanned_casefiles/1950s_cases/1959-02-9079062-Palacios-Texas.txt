The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the letter "A" marking the point where the object was first seen, and the letter "B" showing how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person standing in the foreground, and another smaller landscape scene in the inset.

Text extracted from the image:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

Transcribed text from the document:

Top red, after it began to slow down, it caused me to look at my watch. Then after I looked again, I noticed a mass of very small lights white, but smaller. That must have been lighting the object. Then the mass of lights about one third the size of the original object. This mass of lights after staring about 15 seconds after the object then suddenly went off as a light. It remained dark then after about 30-34 minutes, bright lights then appeared to drift as close to the top where a mass of lights were about 7-8 min. It is hard to estimate if the lights were on the object that it was. Can't say for certain is was not attached to the small lights vanished all at a time. Then the small object appeared to be lined up in 4 or 5 shapes. Then it which pointed downward until only 1 light remained. The car was small tail lights passed it was on the remote. The year was 1952 until it was invisible.

Major: Lawrence J. Thacker 
USAF Executive Officer of Information Services 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Dear Major Thacker:-

After mailing the questionnarie on yesterdays mail I thought of aq situation that in my opinion is of vast importance in establishing the distance and size of the objects.
The size of which I from my observation (not being larger) when first seen was about one half the radius from the west/center of the radars pinpoint when in close co threem minutes. I wish I could give you the exact precise on time it had moved to point on distance of adjustment. These adjustments though I some two or three occurred, I came up with a formation.

In addition to the angular calculations from a given point on the earth, let us assume that we are on the star trained on a given point on the earth and noting the changes said point moved with the rotation of the earth which we know to be about 16-miles per minute.  The three minutes of time distance from point to point would indicate that star was first seen would be 48 to 50 miles from the center of the 1/2 radius train then the diameter of circular cluster would be 30 to 32 miles the projection would be about 1/92 miles or viewing point. 

On hand that is too much for me.  Let us assume the projection was only 20-30 miles then the distance of the formation was to much for me.
It seems to me this projection in miles degrees is to 20# to 30 miles and the object traveled say 21 degrees in 2 minutes or less the speed would be the ratio of 21/2 x 4000 = 42,000 miles per min.

Now let me quote from a ten verse poem I composed in 1946:

"There'll be new methods of flying not with our crude machines, 
O'ercoming gravity, the scientist will conquers;
It may be a chemist compound that gravity will repel,
Where for the unknown power we'll wait for time to tell."

Now let us change the last two lines to read:

"It may be an electric ray that gravity will weigh-nil; 
Then will all air-born craft be truly out of date."

Then assuming some super intelligent being way out in space has really accomplished the feat: A million Gs. would suffice no ill effects and a million Gs. would suffer no ill effects of acceleration.

Sincerely,

(Signature redacted)

Palacios, Texas

March 4th, 1959.

Commander in Chief
U. S. A. F.
Washington, 25, D. C.

Dear Commander:- 

An unidentifiable object appeared in the sky Feb. 10, at about 5:40 A.M. which was traveling South by a few degrees East and stopped by the star ( Y ) in VIRGO, THEN there appeared a mass of small lights around it and it had an ability to move clock-wise among the lights in an erratic course about one-third the radius from the outer rim of the circular mass of lights, then after completing about 7/8 of a circle it moved to the center of the mass and came to rest with its North side almost touching the star, then I failed to see the small lights they seemed to vanish all at the same time, then the main object seemed to change its design; the length seemed to change to its depth and in less than 15 seconds it grew so small that it was invisible, as the vanishing in the distance.

The object was about two times longer than its width and its depth appeared to be two-thirds of its width, with all corners rounded, Shining with a reddish red glow.

That you might be interested or help me contact someone who is.

Yours truely.

Text extracted from the document:

BE BLUE WAS TO VIEWER WHICH A SMALL WHITE LIGHT. IT SUDDENLY SPREAD OUT IN A BRIGHT BLUE BURST OR EXPLOSION AND A SMALL WHITE LIGHT REMAINED. IT COULD NOT BE A STAR OR PLANET SINCE IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SUDDEN AND DURING DAYTIME. 

IT WAS TO HAVE BEEN ABOUT 3 MILES DISTANT AND 100 YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND. IT HAD PERFECT CONTROL AND ABILITY AT ALL TIMES. IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS DISTANCE IS VERY GREAT.

23. HOW DID THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS DISAPPEAR FROM VIEW? IT GRADUALLY FADED SMALLER.

24. IN ORDER THAT WE CAN GIVE AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, WE WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO IMAGINE THAT YOU COULD CONSTRUCT THE OBJECT THAT YOU SAW. OF WHAT MATERIAL WOULD YOU MAKE IT? HOW LARGE WOULD IT BE, AND WHAT SHAPE? EXPLAIN HOW IT COULD PERFORM THE MOTIONS THAT YOU SAW IT MAKE.

IT WOULD BE OF SHEET IRON NEAR PROPER SHAPES AS POSSIBLE IN A DANKNESS ROOM WITH A SPOTLIGHT ATTACHED. IT WOULD BE MUCH LARGER THAN THE OBJECT SEEN, PROBABLY 8 TO 10 FEET ACROSS. IT COULD THEN BE MOVED MECHANICALLY TO SHOW THE DESCRIBED MOTION WITH PERIODIC SHORT FLASHES WITH RED AND BLUE LIGHTS TO MATCH THE OBSERVED EFFECTS. TWO TIMES COULD CREATE THE EFFECT OBSERVED, WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY AND EXPENSE.
