STATEMENT

On Sunday the 22 August 1952, about the hour of 8:00 P.M., my family and I were driving from Cloudcroft to Alamogordo to attend the movie.

Just after passing through the tunnel on highway 82, which is about eight miles east of Alamogordo, my other boy said "look up there at those two bright stars". On looking up to where he was pointing, which was in the northwest sky there were two very bright lights, which appeared to be stars of about the same brightness as the Morning Star. One appeared to be about six inches directly above the other, and was perfectly motionless.

We then passed through a cut in the mountain, which obstructed them from our view. Then we had passed through this cut and looked again so see them, they had disappeared.

In just a second my wife said "look there". One of the lights had descended quite a distance and was still descending. It continued to descend until it was about one eye level with me, at which time it leveled off over the valley traveling in a southerly direction. It continued on in this direction until it disappeared from our view behind a mountain. It seemed to be traveling at a much greater rate of speed than what a jet type aircraft can travel.

We did not see what happen to the other light that was there when first discovered.

[Signed]
Allen D. Myran

AF FORM 112-PART 1
United States

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

LOCATION: Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico    FROM (Group): Intelligence Section
DATE OF INFORMATION: 21 August, 1952    DATE OF EVALUATION: 31 August, 1952

SUBJECT: Observation reported by T. and W.

SUMMARY:
1. Shape of both objects appeared to be similar to a large star. At first sighting there appeared to be two stars very close together. Color appeared to be same as a bright star. There were no trails or exhaust and no sign of propulsion. When first sighted the objects were stationary at a 45 degree angle of elevation. At this point the observer went through a set of calculations of both objects. Then observation was again possible only one object was observed. The object was moving slightly downward and continued to until a point level with the horizon. ATC has been reached at which point it leveled off and flew in a southerly lateral direction. An altitude of about 6000 feet was claimed. The compared speed of object appeared to be faster than a jet could fly.

2. The two objects were observed at approximately 2000 feet for a period of approximately three minutes.

3. Observation was visual and without the benefit of any optical or electronic equipment.

4. Position of observer was at 32 degrees 58"W and 105 degrees 54"W approximately one and one half (1 1/2) miles east of the highway tunnel. Position of objects when first sighted was at 35 degrees 09' approximately two and three quarter (2 3/4) miles southwest of Tularosa, New Mexico at 105 degrees 04' and 106 degrees 05' and continued slightly southeast at approximately 31 degrees 05' and traveling in a southerly direction at approximately the same altitude as the observatory, which was about (6000) feet. Distance of object from observer was unknown.

5. Mr. [REDACTED], chief clerk at aircraft maintenance, has been working at Holloman AFB for one year and seven months.

6. Weather data included for 20:30 and 21 August, 1952 with temperature, wind speed, pressure, and humidity measurements.
