10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Sources were U.S. Army soldiers on patrol. On 1st patrol they observed a very bright, fuzzy light to the west above the horizon, large as grapefruit. It was cold, drizzly, windy & cloudy.

On 2nd patrol they observed a pulsating light that looked "like a star". For 25 mins about 5Â° above horizon toward SSE.

Determined that they had discussed their sighting among themselves before reporting them. (determined by AF Investigators).

11. COMMENTS
This obviously another case where 1st was influenced by famous Levelland case which took place few hrs before & was given national wide publicity by press, radio & TV.

Sources very young (18-20) impressionable & on duty in a lonely, isolated desert post. Interviewer agreed that their statements were magnified out of proportion. Conclusions: 1st patrol sighting - moon set. 2nd patrol sighting - Venus.

E-M and Non-E-M Saucers

The next UFOs reported in this series belong to the old-fashioned, non-E-M variety. From White Sands Proving Grounds near Alamogordo, New Mexico, came a report that military police, while patrolling the up-range in a jeep about 2:30 Sunday morning (a few hours after the Succedo incident), had seen a brilliant reddish-orange light, shaped like an egg, hovering in the sky. From its apparent distance (two to three miles away) and apparent size (as large as a grapefruit held at arm's length), the men deduced that it was a huge object, 75 to 100 yards in diameter [2]. After remaining motionless for about three minutes, it descended toward the ground and disappeared. (According to some versions, it later rose into the sky and then disappeared.) Members of another jeep patrol soon matched this tale with the report that Sunday night about eight o'clock they had seen a bright, glowing object hovering in the sky but, instead of landing, it suddenly climbed until it got so far up it looked like a star. Both, jeeps, it should be noted, continued to function normally.

Officials at White Sands soon dampened the excitement. The description of the light that appeared at 2:30 A.M. included certain doubtful factors. The night had been overcast and so dark that the stars were not visible, although the cloud cover was broken at intervals. Since the sighting had not included any object of known distance or known size for comparison, the estimates of the UFO's distance and size were of no value. The light might have been small and close; it might equally well have been huge and far away. Under the circumstances, the most probable explanation was an illusion that the men had glimpsed the moon (then roughly half full) through broken clouds, and that the apparent movement was an illusion produced by the moving clouds. The Sunday evening UFO was unquestionably the planet Venus. Then nearly at maximum brilliance, it was a conspicuous object in the western sky after sunset and inspired many saucer reports during this week of anxiety.

The White Sands incidents had reached the papers, however, and contributed to the general hysteria. By Monday afternoon, flying eggs were allegedly stopping automobiles as far north as Canada, but the Southwest continued to hold the center of the UFO stage against all competition.

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: SOURCE appeared to be quite ingenuous, naive and impressionable. He was immaculately dressed in his Army uniform and meticulously observed military courtesy. SOURCE appeared to be quite sincere, cooperative, and eager to describe the sighting. By the time this interviewer was able to talk with SOURCE, he had been interviewed several times by press representatives as well as military personnel, had discussed it with the other patrol, and to some extent with hesitation or uncertainty. In the opinion of this interviewer, SOURCE is quite sincere and in his belief that he truly saw "something." However, it is believed that his description has been magnified out of all proportion.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 0230/302 Nov 57, SOURCE, together with PFC James R. Wilbanks, was on a routine motor patrol SE of the "up range" area of the White Sands Proving Grounds, when he noticed a "very bright" object high in the sky. This object slowly descended to an altitude estimated between fifty (50) yards where it remained motionless for about three (3) minutes, then descended to the ground area in light west of the object. The object was in view, emitted no vapor or smoke. The object was in view for about ten (10) minutes, and SOURCE estimated that it was approximately one (1) mile away. It was estimated to be between seventy-five (75) and 100 yards in diameter, and shaped like an egg. SOURCE stated that it was as large as a grapefruit held at arms length. The weather was cold, clear, and windy. SOURCE stated no stars were visible. After the light went out, SOURCE and PFC Wilbanks continued north to the STALLION SITE CAMP and reported the incident to the Sergeant of the Guard, who returned to the area but failed to find anything. SOURCE's signed and sworn statement to his Commanding Officer is quoted in full.

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCES: Both SOURCES, interviewed by press and military personnel prior to this interviewer's talk with them, gave identical accounts of the sighting. The two (2) SOURCES were not considered military courteous or all first-class impressed this interviewer as being not at all observant or competent witnesses. The general tenor of their conversation did not indicate keen insight or details, nor did it indicate above average intelligence. In the opinion of this interviewer, SOURCE's account of the sighting has been magnified out of all proportion to its importance, and the attendant publicity has been more sensational than factual.

III. SOURCES' DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 04:0300Z Nov 57, the two (2) SOURCES were on a routine motor patrol near the Trinity site at the White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico, driving west on a Jeep. The night was fairly bright with some stars visible through scattered clouds. The moon was visible. At the same moment, both SOURCES became aware of a brief light which almost instantly claimed to approximate forty-five (45) degrees from the horizon. The light appeared to pulsate, and was then colored a faded metallic gray. At the time did it appear behind clouds. SOURCES did not observe any smoke or vapor, nor did they hear any unusual sounds. The object claimed in the sky until it worked like a star and then disappeared. SOURCES did not have a distinct silhouette, but appeared blurred and fuzzy. SOURCES indicated the object was approximately twenty-five (25) minutes.

"On or about 2000 hours 3 November 1957 Sr-5 Barlow and myself, SR-3 Forest R. Oakes, ZA 135017N, saw a large bright light hanging in the sky approximately fifty (50) feet over bunker. It took off at forty-five (45) degrees angle and went up into the sky, then it started climbing on an angle. I was approximately three hundred feet away and just about as wide. It was very bright, as the craft we were approximately four or five miles at its height."

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: SOURCE appeared to be "life interview", naive and impressionable. He was immediately branded in his Army vernacular as "contributory" clearly. Military contacts. With a general tendency to be soft-spoken, cooperative, and was eager to describe a situation. By the time this interviewer was able to talk with him, he had already discussed it with the other personnel, and discussed it with the other patrol, an we were able to corroborate in this report. In his opinion, he was quite emphatic that he truly saw "something" however, he is aware that it is out of all proportions.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION: At approximately 0930-0950 hrs 57, SOURCE, together with PFC James P. Williams, was on a routine CP watch patrol in the area of the White Sands Proving Ground, when he noticed a "very bright" object o'er high in the sky. This object, SOURCE stated, was approximately (50) yards where it remained motionless or about three (3) minutes. Then described to him as "metallic", "silvery", "round", and "disc-like".

Continued in water or smoke. The object was in view for approx ten (10) minutes, and SOURCE estimated that it was approximately two (2) or three (3) miles away. SOURCE further stated that between seventy-five (75) and 100 yards in diameter, and shaped like a saucer. SOURCE stated that the object was metallic, dull, and white, and SOURCE stated no stars were visible. After this SOURCE took out, from his billfold, a statement which he and PFC WILLIAMS reported the incident to the Sergeant of the Guard, who referred the SOURCE to the Field Station Officer is quoted in full:

"At about 0930-0950 Sunday morning I, SGT. LUTZ PA PFC WILLIAMS were on procedure, north tower South Post when I observed a very bright object approximately fifty (50) yards from the tower at approximately 3000 ft. altitude. Object appeared to be round and then (all) in an angle to the ground and went out. Object was apparently seventy-five (75) to one hundred (100) yards in diameter. When I first saw the object it was approximately three (3) miles from us. Object was not seen again."

PFC WILLIAMS was not available for interviewing, since he was on a three (3) day pass, however, his sworn statement is to his Commanding Officer is noted in full.

"I, PFC JA'S J. GUTIERREZ, saw a fire like object about 0930 the 3 Nov 57 between the tower area and south tower. This is a round all around object approximately (2) or sixty (60) degrees to the ground. It was about three (3) miles out. The object was dark, had no particular shape, and it was soon gone in about a forty (40) to fifty (50) second interval."

UFO SIGHTING, WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS, NEW MEXICO
3 November 1957

RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: Source appeared to be quite ingenuous, naive and
ingenuous. Source was immaculately dressed in his Army uniform and
meticulously observed military courtesy. Source appeared to be quite
sincere, cooperative, and was eager to describe the sightings. By the
time this interviewer was able to talk with Source, he had been interviewed several times by press representatives as well as military personnel, had discussed it with the other patrol, and so gave all answers
without hesitation or uncertainty. In the opinion of this interviewer,
Source is quite sincere in his belief that "truly saw 'something'."
However, it is believed that this has been magnified out of all proportion.

OBJECTS DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 0230, 3 November
1957, Cpl X together with PFC Y, was on a routine motor patrol of the
"up range" area of the White Sands Proving Grounds, when he noticed a
very bright object high in the sky. This object slowly descended to
an altitude estimated to be approximately fifty (50) yards were it
remained motionless for about three (3) minutes, then descended to the
ground where the light went out. The object was not blurred or fuzzy,
but was a vapor or smoke. The object was in view for about ten (10)
minutes, and Source estimated that it was approximately two (2) or
three (3) miles away. It was estimated to be between seventy-five
(75) and 100 yards in diameter, and shaped like an egg. Source stated
that it was as large as a grapefruit held at arm's length. The weather
was cold, drizzling, and windy, and Source stated no acres were visible.
After the light went out, Source and PFC Y continued north to the
STALLION SITE CAMP and reported the incident to the Sergeant of the
Guard, who returned to the area but failed to find anything. Source's
signed and sworn statement to his Commanding Officer is quoted in full:

"AT about 0230-0300 Sunday morning, I, CPL X and PFC Y were on
patrol in Range Area when we noticed a very bright object high in the
sky. We were proceeding north toward South Cates and object kept coming
down toward the ground. Object stopped approximately fifty (50) yards
from the ground and went out and nothing could be seen. A few minutes
later object became real bright (like the sun) then fell in an angle
to the ground and went out. Object was approximately seventy-five
(75) to 100 yards in diameter and shaped like an egg. Object landed
by the bunker area approximately three (3) miles from us. Object was
not seen again./END OF STATEMENT"

PFC Y was not available for interview, since he was on a three (3) day
pass, however, his alleged and sworn statement is his Commanding Officer
is quoted in full:

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCES: Both sources are military police officers and have been interviewed by means of military procedure. Both (2) sources appear to be reliable and their information is considered factual. The two (2) sources have most are observed military activities and times, but supplemental information is not available. The general tenor of their conversation did not indicate keen insight or unusual, nor did it indicate any apparent lack of knowledge. In the opinion of the interviewing officer, the account of the sighting has been amplified out of all proportion to its importance, and the observed reliability has been somewhat questionable.

III. SIGNIFICANT DETAILS OF SIGHTING: At approximately 0630002 Nov 57, the two (2) sources were on a routine motor patrol near the Trinity site at the White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. While passing through scattered clouds, the moon was visible. At the same instant, both sources observed an object which they could not identify. The object appeared to be approximately twenty-five (25) degrees from the horizon. The light appeared to be white, and then white, yellow, and red. The object was approximately one mile distant. SOURCES did not observe any smoke or vapor, nor did they hear any unusual sounds. The object disappeared in the sky without a trace. When first sighted, the object was a solid silhouette, but appeared "blurred" and fuzzy. SOURCES viewed the object for approximately twenty-five (25) minutes.

"Lt. 400 W. saw a fire like object about 0240 the 3 Nov 57 between the bunker area and Oscura Gates, this is about 211 ft remember seeing, it was about sixty (60) or eighty (80) feet off the ground and it started down then in view about ten (10) miles, then it saw it again and it started down in about a forty (40) degree angle. It was about three (3) miles away and was about 120 feet in diameter. END OF STATEMENT

PRELIMINARY OR SOURCES: Both Sources, interviewed by press and military personnel prior to this interview's talk with the two cave level identical accounts of the sighting. The two (2) Sources were last and observed military counter courtesy at all times, but impressed "his interest was not at all observant or competent witnesses. The general tenor of their conversation did not indicate less than total lack of details above average intelligence. In the opinion of this interviewer, Sources accounts of the sighting has been amplified out of all proportion to its importance, and the attendant publicity has been more sensational than factual.

SYNOPSIS DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 2000, 3 November 1957, the two (2) Sources were on a routine motor patrol near the Trinity site at the White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico, driving west in a jeep. The night was fairly bright with some stars visible through scattered clouds. The moon was visible. At the same moment, both Sources became aware of a bright light in the sky which slowly climbed to approximately forty-five (45) degrees from the horizon. The light appeared to pulsate, and was the color of heated metal; red, then white. As no time did illuminate behind clouds. Sources did not observe any smoke or vapor, nor did they hear any unusual sounds. The object climbed in the sky until it looked like a star and then disappeared. The object did not have a distinct silhouette, but appeared blurred and fuzzy. Sources viewed the object for approximately twenty-five (25) minutes. Signed and sworn statements made to their Commanding Officer are quoted below:

Signed and sworn statements of SP-3 A to his Commanding Officer is quoted in full:

"On the four (4) to twelve (12) Patrol, 3rd Nov 57, SP-3 A and I, SP-3 A, on our check at Trinity Site, at approximately 2000, we locked in the general area of the West Impact area, and saw a bright light leave the ground and proceeding slowly into the air. We watched it for a few minutes and then proceeded to his site, when we started the Range then. The object kept getting brighter, then going dimmer, then out then proceeded to get brighter again. On arriving at slip sites, we set and watched it for a few minutes then it disappeared, we then proceeded to the HQ and notified the SGT of the Guard. On our way to the HQ we saw the object several times and then disappear again." (END OF STATEMENT)

Here is the text from the document:

"On or about 2000 hours 3 November 1957 ST-2 A and myself, ST-3 (2) saw a large bright light hanging approximately 50 feet over lumber. It took off at forty-five (45) degrees angle and went up into the sky, then it started blinking, on and off. Then it disappeared. I would say it was two or three hundred feet long and just about as wide. It was very bright, as the sun. We were approximately four or five miles west of the U.S. AIR FORCE STATION.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with Dr. Lincoln LaRaz, Head of the Department of Meteorologies at the University of New Mexico, revealed that no unusual meteorological or astronomical phenomena occurred during this period.

2. Weather records reveal that the planet Venus was at first magnitude at 2000 hours EST, and at 15 degrees elevation, with an azimuth of 225 degrees.

3. Moonset on 3 November 1957 was at 0229 hours EST at an azimuth of 270 degrees.

CONCLUSIONS:

1. The conclusion is that the first patrol probably, due to refraction, mistook moonset for an UFO and that the second patrol probably witnessed the planet Venus.

2. Both sightings were made by young and impressionable sources, on duty in lonely and isolated areas."
