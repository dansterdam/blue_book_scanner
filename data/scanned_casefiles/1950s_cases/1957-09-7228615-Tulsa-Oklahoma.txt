SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object (UFOB)

TO: Commander

Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma

1. On 8 October 1957 Mr.      , age 30, of Oklahoma, reported to this office
that at 1700 hours on 15 September 1957, he observed an unidentified
object in the sky over Tulsa, Oklahoma. The object was described as
bright silver in color, and appeared to be traveling at an estimated
speed of over 1,000 mph. He made notes of the occurrence but did not report it until 8 October 1957.

2. As a result of the AFS-641 which is a component of the APS-64, which
is a ground-controlled interception system, the object was tracked at an estimated
speed of 24,000 miles per hour from North to South. He followed the return for
a distance at which time it disappeared from the center of the scope. He
reported that the object appeared to be traveling at an estimated speed of 24,000 miles per hour.

3. Because the reported sighting was made on a radar set in an
aircraft on the ground and because the particular radar set normally
will receive reflections only from objects below it, the probability
that the object was actually an extreme high-altitude aircraft is
extremely remote. There is the possibility that it was some other
radar phenomenon; however, he stated that he conducted further
checks on the set and could find nothing wrong with it.

This information is furnished pursuant to OCAMA Supplement No. 
1 to AF Regulation 200-2.
