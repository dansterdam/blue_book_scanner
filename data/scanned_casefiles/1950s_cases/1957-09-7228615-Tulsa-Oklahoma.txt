OCRD

9 October 1957

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object (UFOB)

TO:   Commander
        Oklahoma City Air Materiel Area
        ATTN: OCIS
        Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma

1. On 8 October 1957 Mr. [redacted], age 30, of [redacted] Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma, reported to this office that at 1700 hours CST on 12 September 1957, he observed an unidentified object on a radar scope while performing his duties as an electronics technician at the Douglas Aircraft Company, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Mr. [redacted] made notes of the occurrence but did not report it until 8 October 1957.

2. Mr. [redacted] was conducting a ground check of the APS-64, which is a component of the MA-7 bombing system of a B-47, when he noticed a return at approximately 60 miles range traveling at an estimated 24,000 miles per hour from North to South. He followed the return for 9 seconds at which time it disappeared in the center of the scope. He did not observe it beyond that point.

3. Because the reported sighting was made on a radar set in an aircraft on the ground and because the particular radar set normally will receive reflections only from objects below it, the probability that Mr. [redacted] observed a flying object is extremely remote. It is believed more likely that he observed a malfunction in the set or some other radar phenomena; however, he stated that he conducted further checks on the set and could find nothing wrong with it.

4. This information is furnished pursuant to OCAMA Supplement No. 1 to AF Regulation 200-2.
