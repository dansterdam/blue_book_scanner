and distance from the observer. No sounds were associated with this object and
the duration of sighting was less than a minute. Individual did not see or hear
any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. Location of the observer
at the time of the sighting was southwest of Calera, Alabama, latitude 33 degrees
50 minutes North, longitude 86 degrees 05 minutes West. Reliability B-4.

On 17 August 1953 at 2055 hours local time, two observers were looking
for the Little Dipper when they saw the flying object. It appeared as a bright
reddish glow heading from the North to the South and parallel to way 43, on the
east side. Object was traveling at a high rate of speed and at a fairly high
altitude. Both observers agreed that this object far exceeded the speed of jet
aircraft they had seen in this area. Duration of the sighting lasted for approximately three seconds. Neither of the observers saw or heard any aircraft in the
area at the time of the sighting. There was no sound associated with this object
nor did it appear to be a meteor or a star. Location of the observers at the
time of sighting was Calera, Alabama, latitude 33 degrees 30 minutes North,
longitude 86 degrees 04 minutes West. Reliability C-3.

Reliability of observer is as stated above.

No interception was attempted since the sightings were late in being reported.

The weather is reported as in Enclosure #7.

Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama                                    PAGE    One of Two    PAGES

Details: At approximately 1500 CST, 26 August 1953, the 17034 ATC Intelligence Officer was notified by the MOWA Intelligence Officer of the report of five separate unidentified flying objects observed by Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], Mrs. [redacted] were from 31 July 1953 through 17 August 1953, inclusive.

The Intelligence Officer of the 17034 ATC conducted an investigation and obtained the following statements from the Observers:

On 31 July 1953 at approximately 2000-2330 hours local time, Mr. [redacted] in Creola, Alabama, was on his way home from Creola heading North on Highway 45, when he sighted the flying object. The object appeared into his field of vision through the windshield of his vehicle. The object was first seen crossing the highway and disappeared to the Northeast. The object was traveling at a slow pace or speed and at a fairly high altitude. The object showed a bright reddish glow. No sounds were associated with the glow and did not appear to resemble a meteor or a shooting star. The location of the Observer at the time of sighting was about one mile North of Creola, Alabama, latitude 31 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 02 minutes West. Reliability 3-3.

On 1 August 1953 at 2010 hours local time, Mrs. [redacted] was getting into her vehicle when she sighted the flying object. This object was on the west side of Highway 45 heading from the Northeast to the Southwest at a high rate of speed. She could not estimate the altitude other than stating that it was at a fairly high altitude and that the object was not too far away from where she was standing. She stated that this object appeared to glow a reddish color in the leading part and a dull amber color in the remaining part. Light did not resemble a meteor or a shooting star and no sound was associated with the light. Duration of the sighting could not have lasted more than two or three seconds. Location of the observer at the time of the sighting was in Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 56 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 02 minutes West. Reliability 3-3.

On 2 August 1953 at 0030 hours local time, Mr. [redacted], Methodist Preacher, was on his way home from Creola to Satsuma, Alabama when he sighted the flying object. It glowed an amber color overall with the brightest glow on the leading edge and appeared to be curved like the circumference of a basketball and gave the appearance blurred and tapered toward the rear. The object was heading from the North to the South in straight and level flight parallel to Highway 45, on the East side, at a high altitude. Snbject stated he could not estimate altitude so he guessed that it was 6-5000 feet high. It appeared to be fairly large in size with no sounds associated and traveling at a high rate of speed. Observer estimated no time duration of the sighting. Individual stated he has knowledge of Meteorology and that the object was neither a meteor nor a shooting star. Observer did not see any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. Location of the observer at the time of sighting was at Dunlap Street, approximately on the west side of Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 57 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 02 minutes West.

On 4 August 1953 at 1830-1730 hours local time, Mrs. [redacted] was sighting a dark yard near the flight object. It appeared in a large, wide at the top and tapered to a point at the bottom. It was traveling at an intense rate of speed in a downward path from the Northwest to the Southeast. While in descent, the object gave off a bright red-

Dear Capt. Hardin:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just now gotten down to looking over the large batch of accumulated reports. I must say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these approaches that incident in interest. There are a few interesting sightings, but on none of these is information sufficient to make a follow-up possible.

Of the interesting ones, the very similar sightings of 21 July and 1 August at Key West will warrant follow-up if they were more recent. With present information I have no suggested explanation.

The 26 J--- north AFB Texas also holds possible interest from the standpoint of maneuvers and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by civil and Air Demission, Texas.

It is too bad there is not more information on Creola, Ala. These cases cover four or five days. There is possibly part dirt in these.

Finally, the Slimane sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain an the books as unexplained.

As for the remaining 30 or so, there is so little information concerning those which do not have obvious explanations that there is no percentage whatever in considering them seriously.

Thus, out of the total number there are 1 independent sets which, if staff and time were available, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I vote for sticking with the Black Hawk case as until we have suggested it dry, I feel certain that if this case can be explained, others would follow suit.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, we are proceeding slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence. Since the observations covered areas using radar, it is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this since failure to identify pinpoints a possible real weakness in our defense setup. I hope to have a preliminary report on this case for you soon.

STATEMENT OF
CREOLA, ALABAMA

On or about 21 July 1953 at 20:00-20:30 PM local time, I was on my way home from Creola, heading North on Highway 43. I was approximately one mile north of Creola when an object appeared into my view of vision through the windshield of my vehicle. I could not make out any shape to this object for it was traveling at an intense rate of speed. This object came from the SW, crossed the highway and disappeared to the NE. It was at a high altitude and appeared to be fairly large in size. There was no sound associated with the object. It appeared to be a bright medium fluorescent glow. This glow, in my estimation was not a star or a meteor. I did not hear or see any aircraft in the area at the time of this sighting. There was no moon and only a few clouds and bright stars.

Subject:    "FLYING SAUCER" OBSERVED OVER WOOMERA

    "This officer reports investigation of information of an object alleged to be a
"Flying Saucer" seen in the sky at about 2100 hours on Saturday, 20th September, 1952.

2.    Statements have been taken from the following persons as a cross section of a
reported number of people at Woomera who also observed the object:

[Several lines of text are redacted/blacked out]

3.    The first four named above were at the Woomera West Theatre when Sgt [redacted]
sighted the bright object in the sky. He drew the attention of W/O. [redacted] and it
was seen by all four. The object was visible for several seconds and all four were
able to see the phenomenon before it was obscured by the projector tower after it
had traversed the sky from a line to the right of the screen. This shows the object
was visible some several seconds as it traversed the sky on an even keel parallel
with the earth.

4.    Mrs. [redacted] was standing with her five-year-old son at the corner of the Junior
Ranks Club on Central Avenue when the child drew her attention to a light. She
thought he pointed to a motor-car light on the road near Woomera West in the distance
but the boy corrected her and she saw the bright object as it travelled well above
the horizon until it left her view over the horizon past the Phillips Ponds. Mrs.
[redacted] stated that the time was about 2100 hours.

5.    In each of these cases the persons concerned were quite sober and of responsible
type; therefore, no doubt exists to regard what they say. This is further borne out
by reports from other parts of South Australia, namely of similar observations from
The Advertiser, Adelaide, under dates 23rd, 30th September and 1st October, 1952.

Statement of [redacted], A.F., D.I.D., WOOMERA, made at 1910 hours,
29th September, 1952, and taken by [redacted], Assistant Security Officer, WOOMERA.

I was with [redacted] St. [redacted] at the Woomera Test Open Air
Theatre on Saturday, 28th September.

At between 2045 and 2100 hours T/O [redacted] nudged my arm and said, "Look at the
rocket". I looked and directly right from my seat on the left front of the projector and
saw the object and said, "That is not a rocket". It was a clear-shaped tap-spring off
towards the back. It was lit up like a neon light with a haze around it. The
colouring was whitish and the exhaust or flames at the back were yellowish or cream.
I have no idea of the height, but I can say it was located between 10 to 15 feet,
but comparing it with an aeroplane of the size and height would be about the same as
aircraft I have seen. From my position I would say the angle was 40 to 45 degrees.
From the time I first saw it until it went out of my sight I would say the
time elapsed would be three seconds.

I have observed fast aircraft, meteors and shooting stars. This object was
travelling on an even steady keel faster than any aircraft I've seen but not as far
as the falling stars, besides, this object was travelling horizontally south-west.

Statement of [redacted] attached to D.L.B. WOOMERA, taken at 2010 hours, 20th September, 1952, by J.A. McALARY, Assistant Security Officer, WOOMERA.

I accompanied [redacted] and [redacted] to the Woomera Test Open Air Theatre on Saturday, 27th September, 1952.

At about 2050 hours we were seated on the left side of the theatres, facing the screen, and about third of the distance from the screen. My attention was drawn to a movement in the sky over the right hand corner of the theatre. I observed a cylindrical shaped object with what appeared to be two porterholes with internal lighting. The whole had a lightish grey colour, the size appeared to the eye to be four to five feet. A Lincoln in travelling at night at the same angle looks much larger. It was moving on an even keel, horizontally from northwest to south-west, and at a height of about the height of the theatre fence doubled.

The object had moved some distance before I judged [redacted]. I said "Do you see that?" and pointed. I turned right and remarked to [redacted] "See that".

The object was travelling fast - faster than any jet aircraft I have seen. It is difficult to estimate the speed, especially at night.

I am not prepared to say whether this object was an earthly object, but it was a strange one of some kind.

I have discussed this incident with [redacted] who shares room with me, because we thought we had something which should be reported. I have today made a rough sketch of what I observed.

Statement of [redacted] S.J.V., D.I.D., WOMERA, taken at 1850 hours
20th September, 1962, by J. A. McCAHEY, Assistant Security Officer.

I was one of a party of four D.I.D. personnel who attended the Womera West
Open Air Theatre on Saturday, 27th September. The others were [redacted] and
two others. I have just arrived up here myself. Sgt. [redacted] will give the
other names.

Some time after the show started S[redacted] that's his name, nudged me on
the arm and said, "Look at this". I looked from my position on the left of the
projection towards the right of the screen and in the sky, well above the level of
the fence round the theatre, I saw an illuminated object shaped like a cigar with a
spurting light at the rear, travelling from West to East in a horizontal way. It
was travelling in an even keel and was observed until it was out of sight. As I saw
the thing I then nudged [redacted] and remarked "Look at this", at the same time
pointing in the direction of the object. I would say the object was visible to me
for about five seconds. It was travelling at a much faster speed than a jet aircraft.
I did not hear any noise as the picture show may have drowned any.

Comparing the object with a shooting star I would say that it was definitely
something other than a shooting star or anything from the heavens.
