Two calls were received by the Control Tower at Manston AF Base, England concerning Unidentified Flying Objects on the night of September 20, 1956. First call at 1900 local time was from Mrs. [redacted], Kent. She reported seeing a bright object in the sky 15 miles SW of Ashford. A second call came about 2350 local time from Sgt. [redacted] of Rochester, Kent. He reported seeing an object in the sky at 1840 and again at 1940 local time at Gillingham, Kent. It was headed SE and then SSE. Both calls were put into Flight Service at this Base and they in turn gave it to the RAF Liaison Officer at Oxbridge. He in turn called the Base Operation and said that they might have been cosmic ray balloons.
