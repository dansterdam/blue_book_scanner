At time of sighting, planet Jupiter was high in southwestern sky. Moon was full & rather low in sky at time of sighting. Suggests that sighting was caused by planet Jupiter since it is the direction of the reported sighting and is brightest in that area.

One (1) bright light, approximately the size of a dime held, arm's length, with no sound, and blinding "like a star" was observed to remain motionless in the sky for a considerable time. Sighting was made through a wire screen.

11. COMMENTS
At time of sighting the planet Jupiter was high in the southeastern sky. It was still and rather low in the sky at the time of sighting. This suggests that sighting was caused by the planet Jupiter since it is the brightest celestial body in the direction of the reported sighting at the time of the observation.
