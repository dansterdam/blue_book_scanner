The report states that the object was disc-shaped, approximately 40 feet in diameter, and was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes. The object appeared to be stationary for the first few minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. No sound was reported. This report was investigated by the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, their program to investigate UFO sightings.
