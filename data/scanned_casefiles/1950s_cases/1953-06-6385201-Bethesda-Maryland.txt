Reference your message AVON 58134 concerning unidentified object sighted on 8 June 53 by several Bethesda, Md. observers.

Request (1) check these stations to determine if they made a launching near 1915 hrs., and (2) determine the winds aloft from 5,000 to 40,000 feet at the time and date of sighting.
