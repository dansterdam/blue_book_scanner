The object was described as being approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, lighted from the inside, and traveling at a high rate of speed at an altitude of approximately 3,000 to 4,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of approximately 3 to 5 minutes before it disappeared from view.

2. INTERROGATION: On 7 November 1951, several citizens of Cleburne, Texas, reported sighting an unidentified object in the sky over Cleburne.

UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: Aerial Phenomenon
7 November 1951, at 0539 hours the witness, was a 51-year old fishing guide, observed a clear disk-shaped object at 6700 feet altitude.

The witness called the attention of other personnel to the same object. The object was at first stationary, then moved above 23 miles per hour visibility.

The following radio transmissions were used in new broadcasts:
From Station KGHI, at 0748 hours, 7 November 1951.

KXGO on the 1370 Kc frequency reported a similar object was tracked by radar at 0739 hours, 7 November 1951.

All of continuing reports indicate the object was tracked both visually and by radar. The object was observed to be a perfectly flat disk, reflecting sunlight toward the observer. It was moving in a horizontal direction at a high rate of speed. The object at one point changed its course abruptly from 270 degrees to 90 degrees, maintaining its high rate of speed.

It is believed only about 6 minutes of observation elapsed, after which the object completely disappeared, moving too rapidly to be further observed. It is believed to have moved in a northeasterly direction and vanished from the observer's sight.

MHIO on the GTO FM news, "Standby, 7 November 1951":

The U.S. Air Force at Ft. Smith, Arkansas, confirmed the sighting and stated that the object had been tracked on radar. They stated that the object had changed course abruptly and then disappeared.

SUBJECT: This (2) information comes in a report forwarded to Commanding General, A.T.C. No other action contemplated by this office.

SIGHTING PAN-HELL BEALE AT DURANGO, TEXAS,
NOVEMBER 12, 1952 ABOUT 3:30 PM.

I saw two objects at about 75° elev. and 200° azimuth. They were rapidly in an ESE direction, at a very great height. Both 

were the same size, not appearing metallic, or brilliantly defined, but of a fuzzy, misty, ragged-edged cloud-like appearance, elongated in color, roughly globular, without elevators, fuselage, wings, etc., or any characteristics of any aircraft or guided missiles. They moved over each other vertically every 3 or 4 seconds, holding the same shape and merged entities, always maintaining the same distance apart, held together by a point visible but not distinct. In view in full detail for the same cloud-like structure and color as the two objects. After remaining vertically for about 10 seconds, they moved off horizontally; after 15 or 20 sec., tilted up until vertically and disappeared. Happened 3 or 4 times with the wispy connecting band that was visible at all angles during the multiple motions. The motions were unlike anything seen - multiplicated exactly the same, a bar-bell being turned end-over-end vertically. when tilted clearly until rotating horizontally about 180° elevation and at 95° azimuth when forwarded motion stopped. Moved rather slowly in an irregular zigzag course; had no sound. The objects apparently still on a level course - the objective did not diminish in perspective or visibility as is always normal in viewing receding objects.
