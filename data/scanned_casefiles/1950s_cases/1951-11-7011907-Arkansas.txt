1. SUMMARY: Strange object was sighted by [redacted] San Antonio, Texas Police Department at 0915 hours on 7 November 1951. The object, reported by [redacted] at 1145 hours was on the same day reflected from an airplane. It was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed from east to west.

2. DETAILS: On 7 November 1951 at [redacted] San Antonio Police Department was investigated in connection with an aerial phenomenon sighting, the same person. This alleged object was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed and was described as follows: [most of this paragraph is redacted]

Driving to work on 7 November 1951, he based north on Cato Blvd, located in the north central part of San Antonio. While driving, he saw an unknown object crossing the horizon from west to east. A coating, etc. The object was round and thin with a speed estimated at about 1000 miles per hour. Further, this object showed no signs of wing, a fuselage or there was no tail or drive closure.

Could only state that it appeared to be well over the contour of the earth and was good high as at the hardest visual range and traveling such that only good many miles per hour could be estimated. The object appeared to be in controlled flight as it seemed to stay on a parallel with the earth.

On 7 November 1951 at 0630 hours the weather was clear with fifteen (15) mile visibility; pressure 29.13; temperature 36 degrees; dew point 33; wind calm; altitude 3,957.

The weather reads as follows at 0700 hours on 7 November 1951: weather, clear, ceiling (15) 14k; visibility 15; pressure 29.25; temperature 35; wind calm; altitude 3,957.

The following radio transcriptions used in news broadcast from station WOAI, San Antonio, Texas on 7 November 1951:

The following news item was broadcast at over radio station WOAI on the 1200 PM news, Wednesday, 7 November 1951:

"A lot of conflicting reports are being received about the meteor that flashed across the Texas skies around 7:15 this morning. For instance, one resident says it appeared to be a sky phenomenon. Another said it looked like a huge ball of fire that crashed overhead, and agreed to call in the nearby Iverson River. At Uvalde, the meteor seemed to be moving from north to southeast. At Uvalde, the meteor seemed to be moving from north to southeast. At this western part of the Texas Panhandle, some 20 miles east of Amarillo, others at Childress saw it just north of Gainesville in the Red River Valley area.

"A few things are certain: It was an extremely bright meteor, resembling a miniature sun during its brief test through the atmosphere. It was only about ten seconds. Residents in some areas on the phenomenon -- from Central Texas to Eastern Arkansas, to Central Oklahoma, and westward to Panhandle, New Mexico."

The following news item was broadcast over radio station WOAI on the 6:00 PM news, Wednesday, 7 November 1951:

"That meteor which caused such a sensation yesterday morning, probably fell to earth in a canyon in the neighborhood of Manton, Oklahoma, just west of Oklahoma City. L. Beck, that's the news of my WOAI 11 PM, ran authority on meteors at the Mexico University. He says that a 20 foot meteorite probably descended near Manton, Oklahoma, in the Oklahoma area."

3. ACTION: Two (2) information copies of this report forwarded to Commanding General, ADC to other action indicated by this office.

SIGHTING NEAR DEL RIO, TEXAS,
NOVEMBER 11, 1952 ABOUT 3:40 PM

"I saw two objects at about 75° elev. and 20° azimuth, moving rapidly in an ESE direction, at apparently at a very great height."

were the same size, not appearing metallic, bright, or sharply defined, but of a fuzzy, misty, ragged-edged cloud-like appearance, cloud-gray in color, roughly globular, without elevators, fuselage, wings, etc., of any characteristics of an inflated or deflated balloon or aircraft. They tumbled over each other vertically every 3 or 4 seconds, holding the same shape and ragged outline, always rotating the same distance apart, hold together by a taut, wispy strand, ragged and irregular in width, of the same cloud-like structure and color as the two objects. After rotating vertically for about 40 seconds, they tilted to the right until they rotated horizontally. After 15 or 20 sec., tilted up until vertical rotation was resumed. Happened 3 or 4 times with the wispy connecting band until all visible at all angles during tilting and rotation. The motions duplicated exactly a bar-ball being turned one-over-vertically, then tilted slowly until rotating horizontally, then tilted slowly until horizontal motion continued toward ESE to about 40° elevation and at 95° azimuth when forward motion slowed down somewhat, but with the regularity of the rotations remaining the same, when they turned sharply in a matter of 2 or 3 sec. toward the line to about 75° azimuth, apparently still on a level course. The objects did not diminish in perspective or visibility as is always normal in viewing receding objects.
