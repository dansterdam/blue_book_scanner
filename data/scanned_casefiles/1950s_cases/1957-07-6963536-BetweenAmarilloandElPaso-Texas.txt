Dear Sir:

Your attention is invited to a copy of a teletype press release regarding an unidentified flying object. A copy of the final report of the investigation in question can be made available to the Air Force.

It is further requested, that as a matter of proposed policy, that the results of any investigation initially involving unidentified serial objects be submitted to this Center. A typical example is the recent incident over the Atlantic on the 9th of March of this year, concerning which the Air Force conducted an investigation and analysis.

Copies of CAA investigation reports would be a desired complement to existing Air Force files involving unidentified aerial phenomena, as well as to provide data for assessing inquiries from the press and public pertaining unusual aerial incidents. As a general rule, such inquiries are made to this Center, and reports of CAA findings on file with this organization would be to the mutual benefit of all concerned.

Sincerely,

1 Incl

Dear General Watson:

This will acknowledge receipt of your letter, reference number ATIC-4-24, dated October 7, 1957, in which you requested copies of the Civil aeronautics investigation final reports of unidentified flying incidents involving commercial airliners and the sighting of unidentified flying objects, which had been previously reported in local newspapers.

The first incident mentioned occurred on July 22, 1957, near Amarillo, Texas, and involved Trans World Airlines' Flight No. 21. Subsequent investigation proved that the unidentified aircraft which was displaying the proper navigation lights. The true identity of this aircraft was never determined, however, it is assumed that it was a U. S. Air Force KC-97 aircraft which was known to be operating in the area at the time of the incident.

The second incident mentioned occurred on July 17, 1957, near El Paso, Texas, and involved American Airlines' Flight No. 655. Investigation of this incident definitely established the fact that the unidentified flying object was American Airlines' Flight No. 966, which had previously departed from El Paso, Texas, en route to Dallas, Texas.

Since both incidents, referred above, have been determined to involve other aircraft, it is assumed that the above information will suffice for your records.

In accordance with your request, we are establishing a procedure whereby your organization will be informed of the results of all civil aeronautics administration investigation involving civilian aircraft and the sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena.

Sincerely yours,
