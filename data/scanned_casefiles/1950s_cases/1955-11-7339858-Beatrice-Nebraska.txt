The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a Project Blue Book record card from November 1955, documenting an observation from Beatrice, Nebraska. The text on the card includes details such as the location, date, time, description of the object, and conclusions. I will now act as an OCR system and extract all the text from the document:
