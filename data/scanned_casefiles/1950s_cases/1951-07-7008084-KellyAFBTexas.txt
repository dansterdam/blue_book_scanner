1. SYNOPSIS: Strange light, which might possibly have been reflected by unconventional aircraft, sighted by three persons in the vicinity of San Antonio, Texas, on the evening of 26 July 1951.

2. DETAILS: On 31 July 1951, Sgt EDWARD D. SMART, AF 11 107 162, and Cpl JOSEPH M. MOLINA, AF 16 524, both of Headquarters Squadron, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, were interviewing their sighting of a strange light on the evening of 26 July 1951, which light they sighted might possibly be that reflected. Sgt SMART and Cpl MOLINA, both of wing Control Home Operators at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, related in substance the following information: In the evening of 26 July 1951 Sgt SMART was on a day duty at 2130 hours. There was a day duty at Kelly Air Force Base. Sgt from Sgt SMART, Capt WARD, Control Tower Operator at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, concerning a strange light northeast of Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, was informed by a civilian policeman of San Antonio, Texas, (PD SMITH) advised Sgt SMART that no such light had been sighted, but that a lookout would be maintained for the presence of any such light. Cpl SMITH unsuccessfully attempted to determine if the light as reported by Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, might be the passing light of some aircraft or weather balloon between 2100 and 2120 hours. Sgt SMART and Cpl SMITH observed a yellow light of Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. Both HEWITT and SMART described the light as follows:

3. The yellow light appeared to have no definite shape but was just "a blob of light" which appeared to be slightly larger than a red

Hq 1130 23-37, 16th CSI District (T), Kelly AFB, Texas, 1 August 1951
Subject: Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft

a. Observation Light. STAGG described the color as being somewhere between 
orange and yellow and somewhat similar to a neon sign. The object appeared 
to be by itself, that is one light, and because of the distance, which neither 
alarm could estimate, no secondary features, trail or exhaust, propulsion system 
could be observed.

The light appeared to make a slow gradual descent toward the horizon until 
it disappeared from view.

b. The light was sighted between 2100 and 2130 hours CST and was 
seen for approximately five (5) minutes.

c. The sighting of the light was made visually with the aid of 
binoculars.

d. Both airmen sighted the light from the Control Tower at Kelly 
Air Force Base. It was located in a westerly direction, approximately 
in the vicinity of Hondo, Texas.

On 31 July 1951, Sgt LEON V. HESS, AF 16 221 163, 1922-A ACS Detachment, 
Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, was interviewed concerning the sighting 
of the strange light seen by him in the evening of 28 July 1951. Sgt 
HESS, who is a Control Tower Operator, stated in substance that following 
the arrival of a civilian policeman on 28 July 1951, he was telephonically 
advised by a civilian policeman, that he had just observed an unusually 
bright light in the sky which appeared to be travelling at a great speed 
from west to east. The civilian policeman then made his telephone call, 
and at a distance of 20-30 miles directly west of Brooks Air Force Base and 
almost due west of Randolph Air Force Base. HESS stated that the light 
which appeared to be travelling at a speed between 600-700 miles per hour, 
at an altitude of 5000-7000 feet. HESS reported the Randolph Air Force Base 
Control Tower advised that they could not see the object; however, this 
might be due to the object's movement, that is, the light could only be 
seen when it passed into a cloud. HESS at a later time sighted the light 
travelling from an east to west direction toward Hondo, Texas. HESS 
described the light as follows:

a. The light appeared to be a round object two - three inches 
in diameter, orange-white in color. HESS estimated the speed from 600-
700 miles per hour, at an altitude of 5000 - 7000 feet. The object continued in a straight and level flight.
