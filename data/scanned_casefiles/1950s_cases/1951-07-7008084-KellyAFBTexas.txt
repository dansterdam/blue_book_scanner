1. SYNOPSIS: Strange lights which might possibly have been unconventional aircraft observed in the vicinity of San Angelo, Texas, on 21 July 1951.

2. DETAILS: On 21 July 1951, Cpl REGINALD D. SWENNEY, 6011 207 Tech. Sp. Sq., while on duty at the San Angelo Radio Range, Texas, observed an unusual object in the sky about 20 miles southwest of San Angelo. The object appeared to be elliptical in shape and was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. The object moved at a tremendous rate of speed, estimated at 1,000 to 1,500 mph, and was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object was seen to ascend rapidly, make a sharp 90 degree turn, and then descend at a sharp angle and disappear. Cpl SWENNEY states that the object emitted no exhaust or flame, and that the maneuvers performed were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. Cpl SWENNEY is a reliable and stable individual, has had considerable experience in observing conventional aircraft, and is positive in his identification of the object as being unconventional. No other witnesses were obtained.

3. The yellow light appeared to have no definite shape but was more like a "blob of light" which appeared to be brightly illuminated. DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR

Observation Data. STACT described the color as being somewhere between an orange and bright white, which was brightor than the color of the moon st that tine. The object appeared to be rounded at one end and tapering to a point at the other. It was viewed through binoculars and seemed to be approximately the size of a commercial aircraft at a distance. The light was extremely bright and caused a visual disability for the observers, lasting for several seconds after it disappeared from view.

b. The light was sighted between 2103 and 2138 hours CWT and was seen for approximately five (5) minutes.

c. The sighting of the light was made visually with the aid of binoculars.

d. Both airman sighted the light from the Central Tower at Kelly Air Force Base. The light was located in a northeasterly direction, approximately in the vicinity of the City of San Antonio.

On 31 July 1951, Cpl LEON W. LENZ, AP 16 651 763, and 2Â«Tr JAMES BURKS, AR 62,324,629 reported the following description of the event as related by the airman on 24 July 1951. Cpl LENZ related that on 24 July 1951, while on duty in the Central Tower at Kelly AFB, Texas, he and 2/Lt BURKS observed an extremely bright light in the northeast approximately 20 to 30 miles distant. They stated the light appeared to be round in shape and varied in intensity from a bright white to an orange color. The object seemed to remain stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then began to gradually move to the west, increasing in speed as it disappeared into a cloud formation. They described the light as follows:

The light appeared to be a round object of two - three times the size of a commercial aircraft at a distance of 700 miles per hour, at an altitude of 9,000 to 10,000 feet. This object remained stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then moved off to the west at an extremely high rate of speed, disappearing into a nearby cloud formation.
