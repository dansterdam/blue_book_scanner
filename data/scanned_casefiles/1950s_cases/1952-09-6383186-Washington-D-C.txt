OCR Text Output:

A FIERY BALL THAT STREAKED THROUGH THE NIGHT PROBABLY WAS A METEOR. IT WAS SIGHTED BY SEVERAL PERSONS IN THE WASHINGTON AREA SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT TUESDAY AND OTHERS REPORTED SEEING THE LIGHT STREAK ACROSS THE SKY FROM THE WEST AT A TERRIFIC SPEED. ONE MAN WHO WAS STANDING ON HIS FRONT PORCH SAID IT APPEARED TO BE A HUGE METEOR BURSTING INTO FLAME. THE REPORT OVER LITTLE CURRENT, ONTARIO, WAS MORE DETAILED, DESCRIBING IT AS "A LARGE GLOWING OBJECT LIKE A FIRE BALL WHICH CAME STREAKING DOWN FROM THE SKY AT A TERRIFIC SPEED AND BROKE UP INTO SMALLER PIECES ABOUT 300-400 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND". OTHER REPORTS INDICATED IT BROKE UP AT A LOWER ALTITUDE AND WAS VISIBLE OVER A VERY WIDE AREA FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. THIS INCIDENT WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE BLUE BOOK SECTION.

BALTIMORE RECEIVED THE SAME OBJECT, WHICH LIGHT-FLARED FLYING FASTER THAN TALK AMONG PEOPLE WHO WITNESSED IT. THERE WAS APPARENTLY NO SOUND, NOR ANY AFTERTRACK. THE OBJECT WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF WASHINGTON AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. PERSONS WHO SAW IT DESCRIBED IT AS "YELLOW OR ORANGE AND COMING STRAIGHT DOWN, PICKING UP SPEED AS IT WENT." DESPITE INTENSIVE SEARCHBY THE AIR FORCE AND NAVAL OBSERVATORY, NO CRATER OR WRECKAGE HAS BEEN FOUND.

IT IS BEING BOMBED ON WASHINGTON AREA RADAR SCREENS TO RECORD THE FLIGHT PATH AND VELOCITY OF THE OBJECT.

SAUCERS: 
LONDON - AP - THE BRITISH INTERPLANETARY SOCIETY SAID TODAY THAT IT BELIEVES A FLYING SAUCER WAS RECENTLY SEEN OVER LONDON BY ONE OF ITS DIRECTORS. PATRICK MOORE, DIRECTOR OF THE SOCIETY, SAID HIS REPORT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND BELIEVED TO BE AUTHENTIC. HE SAID HIS WIFE SAW IT FIRST AND CALLED HIM OUT TO SEE IT. HE WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AS IT HOVERED, THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT AT A SPEED HE ESTIMATED WAS ABOUT 1,000 MILES AN HOUR.

THE FLYING SAUCER FAD NEARLY MADE A COMEBACK IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL TONIGHT.
ACCORDING TO RESIDENTS IN THAT AREA, A BRILLIANT FLASHING OBJECT FLASHED ACROSS THE SKY OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. TONIGHT. THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT OBSERVERS, INCLUDING OFFICIALS AT THE NAVAL OBSERVATORY. SAYS THE REPORT: "SAUCERS MAKING A COME-BACK?" REPORTS POURED INTO POLICE STATIONS, NEWSPAPER OFFICES, AND RADIO AND TV STATIONS FROM PERSONS WHO WATCHED THE STRANGE AERIAL DISPLAY.
POLICE AND MILITARY OFFICIALS INVESTIGATED THE PHENOMENON AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD TERMED IT "MERELY A WEATHER BALLOON." AUTHORITIES OFFICIALLY ACCOUNTED FOR THE SIGHTING. REPORTS ARE STILL BEING CHECKED HOWEVER, AND NO DEFINITE ACCOUNT HAS BEEN GIVEN AS YET.

OBJECTS BELIEVED TO BE SATELLITES HAVE SOARED THROUGH THE SKIES IN THREE STATES AND THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
TWO FLASHES OF LIGHT WERE SIGHTED IN THE WEST ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK THIS EVENING. OFFICIALS SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN REFLECTIONS OF SUNLIGHT OFF SATELLITES OR MISSILES. THEIR ALLURING TAILS SAID TO BE "37-38" MILES IN LENGTH. THESE BRILLIANT LIGHTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN MANY SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY.
