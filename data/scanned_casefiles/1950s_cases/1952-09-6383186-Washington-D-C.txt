THE FLYING SAUCER FAD NEARLY MADE A COMEBACK IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL TONIGHT.

CROSS-RESIDENTS IN THE AREA SAW A BRILLIANT FLASHING OBJECT FLASH ACROSS THE SKY TONIGHT. A SPOKESMAN AT THE NAVAL OBSERVATORY SAYS THE REPORTS "SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL METEOR" BUT ANOTHER REPORT SAID THE OBJECT WAS NOT A SAUCER.

MOST WITNESSES SAID THE OBJECT FLOODED WITH CALLS FROM PERSONS WHO WATCHED THE OBJECT. SOME SAID IT APPEARED TO BE A METEOR, WHILE OTHERS GENERALLY AGREED THAT THE BLAZING MATTER MOVED HORIZONTALLY ACROSS THE SKY AND CAME AWFULLY LOW.

(WASHINGTON)--A BRILLIANT FLARE -- APPARENTLY A METEOR -- FLASHED ACROSS THE SKY NEAR THE NATION'S CAPITAL TONIGHT. NEWSPAPER OFFICES MOST FLOODED WITH CALLS BY PERSONS WONDERING ABOUT SIGHTINGS. NAVAL OBSERVATORY SAID THE OBJECT CAME "AWFULLY LOW." THE NAVAL OBSERVATORY TOWER SAID THE OBJECT DEFINITELY WAS NOT A FLYING SAUCER.

Striking things about the object we
Saw were:

1. Its sudden appearance in the sky as
though from no where.

2. The brightness of the color: white, red
and its blue-green tail.

3. Its suddenness of its disappearance --
over the Virginia Hills, but as though
it had burned out in the sky before
it could possibly have landed. Just
opposite, zoned toward opposite
horizon, moving very fast like a comet
like a rocket, into soundless, then
just couldn't be seen.

4. I personally thought it might be
a non-lethal guided missile,
perhaps from or at other ship or
submarine or installation, thing
tried out.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

If it would be helpful I could give almost exactly like place the object was last from view behind the view about on object from the location we observed it.

From our people accounts of other observers there was a very wide variation in the size, color and direction the object was traveling. While the same object was seen the observations of many people are unreliable in many respects.
