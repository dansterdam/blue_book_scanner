1. On 25 March 1951, at approximately 1850 hours, an observer in the Presque Isle Air Force Base Weather Office noticed an unidentified stationary light or object observed for about 2 minutes at an elevation of 290 degrees from the base. This object changed color from white to red about every six seconds.

2. The same phenomenon was reported by CAA Control Tower Operator, and confirmed by Control Tower Operator at Limestone Air Force Base. Mr. Hansen's statement is included herein.

MEMORANDUM

As 7017, the base operations clerk, on July called the tower to report the sighting of an unidentified object. The object was observed for about 3 minutes and was visible to several other personnel on the base. The object appeared to be triangular in shape and flew at a high rate of speed. It seemed to be at a high altitude. The object was silver in color and gave off a brilliant light. It was first observed in the west and traveled to the east, disappearing from sight over the horizon. The tower reported that it was not a weather balloon or aircraft of any known type. No photographs were taken of the object.

Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects

The following Bell Personnel reported the sighting of unidentified flying objects on March 14, 1951:

The above personnel are located at the Bell Hartford-Stratfield plant, G.E., following the completion of a Captive Flight mission.

No photograph was made of the first sighting, which occurred at approximately 1500 hours while following the flight path of the B-50, which at that time was flying at a heading of approximately 15,000 feet NSL east and slightly south of the base. At the first sighting the objects appeared to the people on the ground to be a flock of birds at a considerable distance. However, in a minute or so the bodies became quite clear and were called to the attention of several and the whole phenomenon enveloped the attention of its staff. At the time his sighting was verified by two men. 

The motion of the bodies (estimated at between 14 and 20 in number) appeared to be of a swirling nature, not unlike a flock of towering geese or a handful of leaves in an updraft. The bodies appeared to be white, however, the general impression was gained that the bodies were white.

Several minutes after the first sighting the writer and others were apprised of the phenomenon. At this time the B-50 had turned to the left on a reciprocal heading and was approximately east of the plant at a high altitude. The bodies continued to curl and in this fashion swirled east of the plant area.

they appeared to move slowly to the north regrouping on at least
two occasions into what appeared to be a V-Formation. At this time
the writer observed the General Control of the phenomenon and thereafter
attempted to give them bearings as seen from the Bell Hariband.

Shortly before 0925-Q-2 was modified, the bodies had grouped
into a V-Formation and commenced heading generally northward. The
bearing heading from the Hariland changed from nearly due east to a
position lined up with Sierra Blanca in what appeared to be a few
minutes time. This gave the impression of a slightly very fast
velocity, the highest speed being heading from the Bell Harirand was slightly
west of Sierra Blanca.

Impressions gained by various Bell Personnel were as follows:

a. Not unlike a handful of leaflets thrown from an airplane.
b. Vibratory motion of individual bodies reported occasionally
not unlike flapping of wings.
c. Total time of observation, from time of first sighting, was
approximately 15 minutes.

It is of interest to note that the ground-to-air and air-to-
ground VHF communications were generally very poor throughout the Bell
mission which commenced at 1345 hours. The ground-to-ground VHF
communications were however very good. In addition, for the last ten
minutes of the 1340 flight VHF communication with the tower was extremely
difficult, and collision danger was simulated as it was estimated
that the writer had difficulty in maintaining visual contact with
the writer communications difficulty.

As additional information, winds aloft to 27,000 feet were
generally westerly, estimated at 50 to 40 knots. The writer is
generally certain that the unusual motion as witnessed could not have been
balloons of Project Sky-Hook.

In conclusion, the writer wishes to emphasise that the aerial
phenomenon was different from anything he has ever seen by to and including
flights of birds.
