GUIDE TO INVESTIGATION (Cond'd)

Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Re Radars now operating on ground
    a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size of targets.

    b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180 degrees), etc., and what radius of turn was not observable, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed.

    c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several targets upon approach.

March 24, 1950

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I, [redacted], the following statement of my own free will.

On Tuesday afternoon, March 14, 1950, about 4:00 P.M., I was standing in front of my service station in Piggott, Arkansas. I looked up and saw a four-motored airplane, believed to be a transport. The plane banked and made a complete circle. Then, I saw an object, other than the plane, in the sky. It was above the plane, in altitude, and looked like a one hundred pound sack of potatoes in size. The color of the object was white or aluminum. The object appeared to be eight thousand (8,000) feet in altitude and at a sixty (60) degree angle on the horizon. It was approximately seventy (70) degrees clockwise from the north and drifting from west to east, almost due east. It remained in view approximately ten (10) minutes.
