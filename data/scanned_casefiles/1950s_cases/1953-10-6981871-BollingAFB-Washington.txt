AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: (4-00)                                                         DATE    3-53

1. Report of sighting an unidentified object submitted by T/Sgt Zackary George
Roumanie, AF21767(B), USAF Band, Bolling AFB, Wash. DC.

2. T/Sgt Roumanie reported seeing a spherical white illuminated object,
appearing approximately the size of a pea. The object seemed to glow, and have
an orange red outline. No sound was heard. The object appeared to be oblong in shape.
There was no sound heard.

3. The object was first seen by T/Sgt Roumanie, who was with T/Sgt Roumanie,
T/Sgt Osiecki and T/Sgt Shank at an unknown location in the sky for a few minutes.
The sky was clear of elevation when first seen was 35° to 40°, and approximately the same when
in disappearance. The flight path of the object was steady. It came out of the
south, southwest to come out the light of the moon, and went slightly upward at about a 20° angle for
with the planet Jupiter. The object went slightly upward at about a 20° angle for
about 25 seconds then looped and came back in the direction it had come. After
making the loop it was seen for about 25 seconds then disappeared. The total time
of sighting was about 50 seconds.

4. The manner of observation was ground to air, and visual. An optical aid was
used. It is documented as a "6 power finder".

5. The date was 19 October at 2135 hours. It was night.

6. The location of observers was from the yard of a grade school located at
14th and H Streets, S.E. Washington, D.C.

7. Identifying information of the observers is as follows:
    T/Sgt John Osiecki, 1100 14th Street S.E., occupation is that
of a secretary in a lumber company located in S.E. Washington. Reliability is
unknown.
    T/Sgt John Osiecki, USAF Band member, Bolling Air Force Base. Reliability
is unknown.
    A/C James E. Shank, AF21379922, USAF Band member, Bolling Air Force Base.
Reliability is unknown.
    T/Sgt Zackary George Roumanie, AF21767(B), USAF Band member, Bolling
Air Force Base. Reliability is unknown.

8. Weather conditions at the time of the sighting were described by the
observers as very good, ceiling high, visibility was clear, no cloud covers, and
there were no thunderstorms in the area. There was almost no wind at the time, and
no unusual conditions were observed which might account for the sighting.

9. There was no investigation by the validity, but it was severe.

10. Upon investigation by Albert S. Hutchinson, Jr., 2d Lt, USAF, Director of
Intelligence, Headquarters Command, USAF, the preponderance of evidence suggests
T/Sgt Roumanie is an amateur astronomer, who has been interested in this hobby for a
number of years. Sgt. Roumanie is a mature individual of sound judgement. Accordingly
the writer believes that the observation made by Sgt. Roumanie and others of this object,
and this life, and definitely claims this object was something unlike anything they
had ever seen before. Sgt. Roumanie saw the object briefly through the optical aid,
with most of the sighting being observed with the naked eye, as it was traveling too
quickly to follow through the sky. In spite of this information, the preparing office
believes that due to the size of the object, and the approximate distance away, over
10 miles, there is little else to conclude other than this object was some sort of
meteor or astronomical disturbance, as not enough definite evidence can be obtained
to definitely characterize.
