34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7   3   67 (Day Month Year)

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

"I close viewed (5 vehicles). In all, I chose the word vehicle due to my own thoughts. These objects were certainly in control at all times. By custom or what, I do not know. They were being operated under control, I decided on the altitude by comparisons with stars, operating patterns of airlines & military aircraft. Radar operator at Selfridge at time & called him, said they had extensive night flying missions at the time. I told him quite, if he could show me the aircraft that could make a 90° Right angle turn at flank speed I would sit every rivet in it. He did say they had some un-counter with Bogie Blips. That is all he would say. I consider myself to be a logical person in every respect & I have had 5 complete medical exams in five years for the USAF & can make other a fact..."

for                 Since, it doesn't bother
the one who to tell people what
I observed, I know what I saw
with my own eyes! I shut off my
engine, got right out of the truck
These objects passed right over me,
silently, no rapid no change in
speed till later, I compared their
speed to the movement by Echo-7
estimated it to be half the
speed of our Ballon. This Brilliance was about equal. The only real
change in appearance was when turning
object increased speed to gain two
leading objects heading NW. This was
the one I could detect point source of
orange R-red from top center, myself
at 20 cities distant. These objects
in this night at this time I was employed as a (rest) Driver for Ford
mfts co. High speed driving was a
common thing. I have to good
estimate in other words by speed
of distance. These things were fan-
tastier, if I may & will, I am
going to enclose a separate sheet
