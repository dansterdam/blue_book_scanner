Case 183, Tarrytown, N.Y., Aug. 9, 1956—At 12:15 police headquarters received a phone call from Walter Kocher who saw a mysterious light in the sky. Sgt. Fintan Maegele was dispatched by radio to investigate. Sgt. confirmed the report together with two other officers. Maegele, a World War II pilot who holds a commercial license, described the light as yellowish, and "six to eight times the size of any star in the sky." He could not estimate its altitude, but said it was moving in a generally southeasterly direction. In his flying experience he had seen nothing like it.... About 1:30 a.m., the light disappeared?
