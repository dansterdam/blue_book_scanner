Case 183, Tarrytown, N.Y., Aug. 9, 1956 - At 12:15 police headquarters received a phone call from a citizen reporting a light in the sky. Patrolman Maessle was dispatched by radio to investigate. He confirmed the report together with two other officers. Patrolman Maessle, with a commercial pilot's license, described the light as "yellowish, and gave to eight times the size of any star in the sky."
