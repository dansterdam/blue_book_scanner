SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

ORIGINATING AGENCY: OAIRA, Manila, Philippines    REPORT NO: EI-92-58

1. Quoted herewith is extract of letter from Father [redacted] who resides at Mindanao (9°00'N - 124°58'E), to Father Hennessy, Director of the Manila Observatory, Manila

"At about (6:15 p.m. 17) p.m. I stood on the little platform at the head of the west stairs. I saw the starry heavens and behold, there came out of the western sky, to about in the ecliptic (cosmic), southern part, a very bright, silvery-white, steady light off sharp rays well around 4°. More brilliant than Venus. And this was its apparent course:

[Hand-drawn arrow diagram showing object moving from west to behind Pilipan Mt. Head at about 40° altitude]

This, therefore, was no meteor!

There was a bright light like a bright star rising. It moved very fast out it seemed to stop or hover in the small or curve and then dash. The mountain (area) perhaps 100 feet above our plain, is only 10 diameters directly west, so it cut off sight completely. The direction was N-S. It is true that such phenomena are within 50 miles. I thought very well to notice it. It seems to me a meteor could not follow such a course. The whole phenomenon was over in more or less a minute."

2. The following comments were made by Father [redacted] in forwarding the above to this office:

3a. The angle reported by Father [redacted] fits perfectly to the degree of description, the directions taken by the known Russian satellites.

3b. It is reported that the Russians are using a re-entry technique which comes in horizontal and produces a skip. It seems that properly desired fins on a rocket would produce the pattern observed. There would be a slowing down as the vehicle rose in the atmosphere due to the encounter with atmospheric particles. It would then descend.

3c. That Father [redacted] should be the one to observe or rather to be in a position to observe another 'phenomenon' is quite reasonable if these vehicles are originating from the same place.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

3. Father [redacted] was interviewed by personnel of this office on 15 February 1958 concerning the sighting reported in [redacted]. Although an elderly man he appeared active physically and mentally. His training and experience are such as to make him a qualified observer.

4. The AF sent ground observation teams into the general area described in the letter dated 11-0-58 but located no debris and learned no additional information concerning the October 1957 sighting.
