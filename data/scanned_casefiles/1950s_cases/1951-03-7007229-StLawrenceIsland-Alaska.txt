Foil is rpt of observation unidentified acft in vic Gambel, St Lawrence island;

1. At approx P2002 19 May 51 one officer two EM of US Army Security Agency observed unidentified acft, believed Jet type, two to three miles NW Gambel St Lawrence Island. Acft, traveling at very high rate of speed, alt 3,500-4,000 ft on one opern 00-90 degs FT flight in and out of topa of heavy fog bank continued on one point 2.5 miles NE Gambel when ? observers believed acft banked or turned to north. Observers, stated acft in sight for total time of 1/2 to three minutes, were unable to distinguish color marking or wing tanks. No sound detected. No smoke or contrails seen. Silhouette of acft against fog bank presented clean lines, no perpendicular breaks or breaks in fuselage. Size estimated similar USAF F-80 or F-86. Two EM observers believed acft had swept wing distinguishing as it turned to north. All three observers believed soft more nearly resoled soft yet type -15 on side view. USAF CAA F-82 acft were seen on previous occasions in vic of Gambel by these observers who stated unidentified acft definitely not of these types. High speed of acft was principal factor causing observers to believe it to be Jet type. No known friendly acft airborne vic Gambel at time of sighting. Gambel radar, inoperative at time of sighting due to malfunction. To date no other reports this sighting by CAA and Mil Hqrs or natives on St Lawrence.
