Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting

Date of Report: 7 July 1953
Date of Information: 3 July 1953

Source: Major Air Force Base, Okla City, Okla

1. Enclosed are statements of observers of unidentified objects sighted between 1200 and 1900 (CST), 2 July 1953.

2. One (1) object reported, round in shape, ranging in size of pin head to an automobile. Observed in vicinity of Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, by two (2) observers. No propulsion system was evident. Observers reported slow movement or hovering, back and forth, and (5) observers reported no movement, object appeared to have vanished when it disappeared.

3. Object viewed with naked eye and through 7 X 50 binoculars.

4. All observers on premises of Tinker Air Force Base and all were within a radius of 2 miles. Object first reported directly over the Base, altitude estimated between 50,000 feet and 50,000 feet.

5. Observers believed to be reliable substantiated by considerable experience viewing aircraft.

6. The weather officer advises all winds aloft from Northwest at 2100 (CST) and winds practically the same 1500 (CST). The weather balloon was in this locality at the time of sighting but balloon should have been apparent from the Northeast. The weather balloon was in this vicinity is substantiated by the fact that weather balloon transmitter was recovered approximately two miles east of the base in July 1953.

7. Meteorological activity not investigated.

8. No fragments were obtained. Seven (7) exposures taken with Vision camera.

I saw an object which I would estimate between 35,000 and 50,000 feet high directly over the Central Tower. I observed this object through binoculars and it appeared to be round and silvery. It was between the size of a pin and a pea. There was just one object. There appeared so as some darker shade in the background. There was no trail or exhaust. It was between the watching and it appeared to stay in one place. There was no speed or sound. It disappeared while I was rewinding the camera.

The time was 1045 and I observed it about ten (10) minutes.

I viewed the object through the binoculars and also naked eye from the Control Tower. We went out on the walk around the tower.

I observed this object from Tinker Air Force Base Control Tower. It was directly over my head and appeared to be between 35,000 to 50,000 feet.

I have been working in the control tower for two (2) years.

The sky was clear behind the object. There were scattered clouds to Northwest, North, Northeast, the temperature was 90°, the wind was Southwest about 15 knots.

I received a call from Base Operations and they told me that a guard had spotted the object at 50,000 feet. I thought at the time they called that it would be useless to go look for it at such an altitude. I went out and looked around and spotted it directly over the field and looked at it for a minute or two through the binoculars. Then I returned to the tower and got the camera. I took seven (7) pictures lying on my back placing it on the rail. After taking pictures I went back to the tower and completely notified Operations and they said they were making out a report to send to Washington and they wanted to know if we had taken any pictures. That is all the information we gave them. No contacted the tower officer and I came up to the tower and turned in the report that I filed out to Crypto Center.

There was no air traffic in the area at that time.

The object I saw was round in shape and white in color. It was very small, smaller than a pan. I just saw one object. There was no trail nor exhaust. To altitude appears to be moving. I just glanced at it. I was not looking at it when it disappeared.

I can't remember what time it was when I saw this object. I observed it for just a few seconds.

I saw this object with the naked eye.

I was at Tinker Air Force Base Control Tower when I observed this object. The object was directly above the tower. I would say the object was around 50,000 feet high.

I worked in the tower for about one (1) month.

In the west there were a few scattered clouds. Just a little after the object disappeared, the sun went behind the clouds. In the east it was clear.

I didn't take any photographs nor obtain any fragments.

I didn't see any airtraffic at this time.

UNCLASSIFIED


- page 5 -

The object was round, very shiny like chrome. I would estimate it to be from 30,000 to 35,000 feet high. I am unable to estimate the size. I saw only one (1) object. There was no trail or exhaust. No speed of movement was noted.

In such a distant move. It was stationary in the sky. I didn't see the object when it disappeared. Looking at it through glasses, every move in a while it looked like from above something would dart out from either side. To locate it was hard. Every move in a while either the top or the bottom would move slightly.

I watched this object approximately 2½ minutes.

I watched it through field glasses and with the naked eye. The field was very 20 strong.

I was at Tinker Air Force Base Control tower when I saw this object. The object was located directly overhead. I would estimate the object to be 30,000 to 35,000 feet high.

I have been working in the control tower for one year.

The sky was completely clear except for some clouds way off on the horizon in the west and in east.

I didn't take any photographs and didn't see any fragments.

There was one aircraft about 2,000 feet. This aircraft was nowhere near the object.

Considering the way the object disappeared, I don't think it was a weather balloon.

I saw one (1) object. It appeared to be round and whitish. It about arms length it appeared to be the size of a pen. There was no trail or exhaust. There was no speed or sound. I wasn't looking when it disappeared.

I saw this object about 1845. I don't remember the time exactly. I watched it for about 10 minutes.

I looked at this through binoculars and with the naked eye. I don't know the power of the binoculars. They are lensed.

I was in the Tinker Air Force Base Control Tower. The object seemed to be directly overhead. I couldn't estimate the altitude.

I have been working in the control tower about one and one-half (1½) years.

There were some scattered clouds. It was about one (1) hour before sunset, visibility about 15 miles.

I didn't take any photographs and didn't obtain any fragments.

I don't remember whether any aircraft were flying around or not.

I saw a white spot in the air. It looked like a star going out. It was about this time a car or something. It was white and bright. It was there was no trail nor comment. There was no sound. Then it was gone. It did not move while I was watching. When it went away it just vanished.

I don't know what time it was when I saw this object. I watched it for about five minutes.

I observed this object visually from the ground. I couldn't find it with the binoculars. I used Binocular No. 7-50.

This object was directly overhead at Tinker Air Force Base. I have no idea how high it was.

From 1942 until the present time I have been a member of the Air Force on active duty or employed at Tinker Air Force Base.

The weather was clear; I don't remember any clouds. There was southwest winds.

I have observed weather balloons, but never saw one as bright as this one was.

No fragments or physical evidence of the object were observed.

I could see one (1) object, real bright and sort of star shaped. It did not look too big as looked like a big thing. I would say the object was real bright. There was no trail nor exhaust. It looked like it was stationary. I was at Jack's in Midwest. There was no sound. It must have been a bout 1,005 when I saw it. I watched it for two (2) minutes.

I observed the object with my naked eye from the ground.

It looked like it was west of Tinker Air Force Base and South of 29th Street. It was 15,000 or 50,000 feet high.

I have been on the Guard Force for eleven (11) years. I am usually exposed to the weather and observe aircraft over the field.

The weather was clear, the sun shining. There were a few floating clouds. I believe it was a weather balloon. The sun was shining on it.

I saw one object. It was round and looked like metal. It was aluminum in color. To trail for occurrence then in the field classes on it, it waved back and forth and when it left it just vanished. There was no sound.

It was about 1355 when I saw it. I watched it about ten (10) minutes.

I observed the object visually from the ground and I used binoculars. The binoculars I used were 7x50 with the natural eye it looked like a big top cup. Then I got the Kansas City 12 in diameter.

The object was directly overhead (Tinker Air Force Base).

I have been on the guard force at Tinker Air Force Base for eleven and one half years (11½). I view aircraft at all times while on duty.

The weather was clear; there were no clouds - nothing to block the vision.

There was no fragments or physical evidence of the object.

I think it was a big weather outfit a big balloon. I would judge the object to be about 10,000 feet high.

I saw one (1) object. It was white or silver in color. I would say that it was approximately 24" x 20" in diameter and it was round. There was no trail nor exhaust. It stood still for approximately five (5) minutes and it seemed to disappear behind a cloud. The clouds were real high.

I saw this object around 1915 and I watched it for about five (5) minutes. I am uncertain as to the exact time I went out to look at it.

The object was visual from the ground. I used binoculars but never could find it.

The object was almost directly straight up and a little south from where I was standing. (Tinker Air Force Base).

I have been on the guard force at Tinker Air Force Base for seven and one-half years (7½). I was in the Navy one and one-half (1½) years aboard an aircraft carrier observing aircraft.

There was very little surface winds. There was a small nimbus this object was behind.

It seemed to me that this object was moved 10,500 feet to 15,000 feet high. Seems or being apparent to be a bright, clear or bright object. I think 1 mile or 2 miles away. When I first saw it, it was so easily. I believe it was a weather balloon.

No fragments or physical evidence of the object were observed.

21 July 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt.:

This is quite a batch coming back at you. I think the idea of being in readiness with a press release is a good idea. I should like to have Dr. [redacted] comments on our Pinchbottle cases.

In two cases here we are taking the liberty of sending out Form A5 with an accompanying note stating that the sighting has been referred to us as having possible astronomical significance, and would they oblige us by filling out the report. If you have any objection to this procedure please let us know.

As to seeing you in the near future, I hope so too. Did you know I am sailing for Europe on August 26th. I'll send you a postcard from Paris! The project here will lie fallow, I'm afraid, during September, but we will attack these problems with great strength in October. How to get on to business.

There appears to be only two possible pinchbottles in this last batch: The 21 June Okinawa and the 22 June Goose AFB. On both of these I should like to request a complete report and follow-up.

The Okinawa one may yet prove to be a balloon, though the evidence is against it. Object going against wind and object disappearing into cloud with relative velocity of 15 kts. I think the best thing to do is to wait for further data. I am asking Jen to needle both you and me on these follow-ups because there is no point in having follow-ups unless they are followed up!

The Goose AFB also needs follow-up with special attention to the 9 questions on our Form "Bye".

Now as to the others: we pass by with a smirk the little monkey man.

As to the Tinker Tower cases, how come such an epidemic of balloons? Can't they tell a balloon from a hole in the ground? Most interesting of the Tinker batch was July 3rd. Glad to see that a camera was used. What did the pictures look like?

On the others, the notes you have made on the Form I just about cover the case.

We have some reference TWs but we don't know to what they refer. They would probably be important only if they refer to our pinchbottle cases.

Please give our regards to Ed and indoctrinate Hilly into the system we have developed. Any comments that either you or he have on this method of handling sightings would of course be appreciated.

Cordially,
[signature redacted]

From a distance the object appeared to be like an airplane. I couldn't tell for sure whether it was round or oblong. It was silver. I would say it was about the size of a B-29. It was a solid object; it was not normal. There was no normal. It stayed still for 15 minutes after I started to watch. There was no movement. It was over the field from between 200 and 500 miles per hour. It stood still over Tinker Air Force Base for about 15 minutes and then it moved almost directly over the field. It was just a little south of me, almost 15 minutes. It started northwest and disappeared immediately. It didn't change color. I noted like a bright light. The light was on all the time that I could tell.

I saw the object at 1930 hours and observed it for 30 minutes.

I observed the object from the ground. I was standing still. I did not use field glasses or binoculars. There was only one object.

When I saw the object I was at Gate No. 27, Tinker Air Force Base. The object was slightly east and north. At about 14 degrees to northwest and stopped practically due over the field. I would say about 14,000 feet high.

I have been employed on the Guard Force at Tinker Air Force Base for eleven (11) years.

The weather was very clear and fair. The wind was approximately 15 to 20 mph South Easterly. Around 1900 scattered clouds came up Southwest.

I did not take any photographs and did not obtain any fragments.

There was one aircraft came in pretty high from the west about 1½ minutes after 1900 hours.

The object appeared to have a light on and it remained on at all times I observed it. The color of the light didn't change at any time.

The object looked round just like a sky basically it was bright white - it looked like a moon with no trail or exhaust. At times it looked like it moved. It moved noticeable slowly. There was no sound. When it disappeared it just vanished. I couldn't locate it any more. The object was just out of sight.

I saw this object at 1000 and I watched it for one (1) hour.

The object was visible from the ground. I first saw this just slightly west of the light posts on the ground.

I was at Gate No. 27, Tinker Air Force Base, when I saw this object. It was on 25 July 1953 at 10,000 feet.

I have been on the Guard Force at Tinker Air Force Base for eleven (11) years. During this time I have observed many things.

There were a few clouds in the west. It was clear in the north. No clouds were directly overhead. The wind was out of South - Southeast.

I did not take any pictures and no fragments were obtained.

Along toward 1255 there was a B-29 going east flying high over the field. I would say it was flying at 10,000 feet.

The object I saw started getting dim and faded away until you couldn't see it.

On 2 July 1953, I saw one object. It was round as a balloon or a dish. As high as 15 was, it would be hard to say whether it would be metal because anything could reflect the sunlight. It seemed to stand still, but when I looked through the glasses it seemed to be moving back and forth within a short radius. I couldn't see anything moving, or in its path. Then it seemed it would go straight up; it did not go sideways. If it had been a balloon it would have burst. There was no sound.

I saw this object between 1830 and 1900 I think about 1845. I watched it for approximately 10 or 15 minutes and it went out of sight. I stayed 10 or 15 minutes longer to see whatever or what it would come back. The work out of sight about 1900.

I observed this object through binoculars No. 7x50 from the ground.

The object was about 5° S.W. from directly overhead (Tinker Air Force Base).

I have had quite a bit of experience observing aircraft in the skies. I was in the Air Corp for four (4) years and have worked three (3) years on the Guard Force at Tinker Air Force Base. I see quite a bit of aircraft in the air while on duty.

The weather was cloudy. There was a blue sky background.

The object was 40,000 to 50,000 feet high.
