Madison, Wisconsin                                                9 December 1952

I.   Description of Incident

Four bright lights in diamond formation were sighted at 2715 by a captain and a lieutenant flying in a T-33 aircraft located south of Madison, Wisconsin. The pilots followed until they overtook the objects and continued following them until low on fuel at which point they returned to their bases. At no time was a silhouette visible, even against the lights of Milwaukee. Visibility was almost unlimited with a broken cloud deck at 25,000 feet. The observing aircraft was at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Local radar was contacted to determine if they picked up the unidentified objects with negative results. The objects were traveling at a very high speed, excessive for weather balloons. The only possible explanation would center around aircraft in the area. To fill the speed of the object the aircraft would probably have to be in the jet category. There is no record of local or transient aircraft in the area. Furthermore, local radar was carrying the T-33 on its scope but had no return from the unidentified objects. If the unknown was an aircraft it would have been evident on the scope.

III. Conclusion

Unknown

Summary: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List Inclosures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part II.)

Four unidentified objects were sighted by Capt. W. D. Bridges, AC3087480, and 1/Lt. J. E. Johnson, 204399A, assigned to the 4355d SIS, Truax Field, Madison, Wisc., while flying in T-33.

Four bright lights in diamond formation were sighted at 17:45 on 9 Dec 1952 at an approximate altitude of 5000 ft., heading 130°, estimated speed 400 mph. Position at sighting was about 10 miles south of Madison, Wisc. (WAC 309) (6902OW - 420597N). Pilots followed the objects at speed of 450 mph until about 10 miles south of Racine, Wisc. Indications were that the sighting and following of the objects - time 17:50S. At this time Capt. Bridges called TWA (GOW) to corroborate the sighting and following of the objects. Gooseberry was unable to pick up objects. Continued on heading of 900 and Pilots followed until low on fuel at 17:55S, then broke away and landed at Truax Field at 18:00S.

Point Brewery was about 10 miles west of Racine, Wisc. At no time was a silhouette visible, even against the lights of Milwaukee. Visibility was practically unlimited, with a ceiling of 25000+. Overcast.

Only visible object during the entire period of sighting were the four bright lights in diamond formation.

a. Did the T-33 aircraft piloted by Capt W. D. Bridges and 1st Lt. C. W. Carson pass over, under, or around the four bright lights?

b. What estimated distance was the aircraft from the bright lights when it passed them?

c. What color were the four bright lights?

d. Does the "contacts" which you refer to in paragraph 2 between the 756th ACGW Squadron and T-33 aircraft refer to radar contacts? If the T-33 aircraft was plotted on the radar scopes, was the image clear and distinct or was it fuzzy and blurred?

e. Were the four bright lights always the same distance apart? Was there any apparent maneuvering or did they seem to fly straight and level at all times?

f. Did the 756th ACGW Squadron attempt to pick up the unidentified flying objects even after the T-33 aircraft broke visual contact? If so, for how long and what were the results?

2. Inclosed you will find two U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheets. The Air Technical Intelligence Center requests that you distribute these by Ist Ind to Capt Johnson and Lt Carson when returning the sheets to this office along with your answers to paragraph 1.

1.      With reference of your questions of letter dated
29, Dec. 1952, the following information is submitted.

    a. The T-33 aircraft piloted by Capt. W. D. Bridges
    and 1st Lt. J. E. Johnson first passed the objects on their
    right hand side, then crossing over to their left hand side,
    flying level, along side the objects. Then the T-33 went low
    to go under and pass in front of the objects. An estimated
    speed of 450 mph was required to pass in front of the objects,
    and then the T-33 crossed back behind the objects and followed
    them.

    The estimated distance when the T-33 passed the objects
    was 1000 ft.

    b. The color of the four lights was a very bright
    white.

    c. The 755th AC&W Squadron had both radio and radar
    contact with the T-33. 755th Squadron reported it could
    paint the T-33 clear on radar, but could not paint the objects.

    d. The four bright lights always remained the same
    distance apart in a diamond formation. Objects flew straight
    and level, but did turn from a Southeast heading to a East
    heading.

    e. On talking with the 755th AC&W Squadron this
    morning, they stated that they tried to contact the objects
    for twenty minutes, with negative results after the T-33 broke
    contact.

2. The two U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheets have been completed with Capt. W. D. Bridges. At the present time 1st Lt. J. F. Johnson is TDY at Maxwell, Ala, attending the Squadron Officers Course. I interviewed Lt. Johnson on 10 Dec. 1952, and his statements were identical with those of Capt. Bridges.

3. An article appeared in the Wisconsin State Journal of Madison, Wisconsin on the morning of 10 Dec. 1952, of the sighting of four bright lights moving in the sky by a farmer, a World War II pilot, in the same general area and approximately the same time as the sightings by Capt. Bridges and Lt. Johnson.
