The image contains a photograph of a newspaper article with the title "Research Rocket Fired" and some text describing the launch of a new Nike research rocket by the United States. The text discusses the purpose of the test, which was to determine wind direction and velocity as well as measure diffusion or dispersion of the rocket's vapor trail. The text also mentions the yellow-orange color of the vapor trail and some technical details about the rocket's performance.

RESEARCH ROCKET FIRED
WASHINGTON, AUG. 27 (AP)
The United States launched the first in a series of new Nike research rockets today. It left a white-orange cloud that was visible over much of the eastern seaboard.
The rocket was fired from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Wallops Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore.
ONE--To determine wind direction and velocity over the range covered by the trail.
TWO--To measure diffusion or dispersion of the rocket's vapor trail in the upper atmosphere.
The yellow color of the vapor trail is characteristic of burning sodium. It was set off by a thermite device when the rocket reached an altitude of about 50 miles.
