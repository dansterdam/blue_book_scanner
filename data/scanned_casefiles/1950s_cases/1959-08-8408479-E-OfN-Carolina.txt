Rocket Fired
17 AUG 59 DAILY NEWS

WASHINGTON, Aug. 17-(/P)--
The United States launched the
first in a series of new Nike
research rockets today. It left a
yellow-orange cloud that was
visible over much of the eastern
seaboard.

The rocket was fired from the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration station at Wallops Island on Virginia's
eastern shore and emitted a 10k
mile sodium vapor trail begin-
ning at an altitude of about 50
miles. It was topped by the large
cloud that was yellow-orange in
color.

Purpose of the test was:
ONE--To determine wind di-
rection and velocity over the
wide range covered by the trail
and cloud.

TWO--To measure diffusion or
the rate at which matter spreads
out in the upper atmosphere.
The yellow color of the giant
flare is characteristic of burn-
ing sodium. It was set off by a
thermite device when the rocket
reached an altitude of about 50
miles.

The glowing color was main-
tained, in part, by light from the
rising sun, striking the vapor
cloud.
