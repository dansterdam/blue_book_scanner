South Euclid, Ohio.

Object: 
Large, wide as average house. Made gruff coarse noise. Somewhat spherical in shape. Row of yellow lights around perimeter. Tree-top height.

b. Results of Interviews:
(1) Sighting: Proceeded to the home of arriving there at approximately 1515 hours of 27 June. Foster mother was not at home, and an interview was held with his foster mother. Mrs. _______ which produced some interesting information regarding this case. It was disclosed that he was an only child, sickly and retarded during his infant years, who was shuttled between Mrs. _______ and other foster parents after loss of his parents. He was legally adopted by Mrs. _______ 3 years ago. His foster mother is of the opinion that he did observe something on 29 August 1955.

b. Results of Interview:

(1) have seen the landing of the "saucer"; talked to the person who emerged from it, and gave him a message in English to the effect (as told to this investigator) that, "...tell your leader, if there is another war---we'll take over!" In confiding this event to his priest, who was advised to tell his story directly to the proper authorities. This he has not done, nor even to his pastor. However, the peculiar aspect of this case is, that he did give this information to Mr. [redacted], a member and self-styled official UFO investigator of the UFORG.

Further investigation disclosed that although [redacted] is considered an Intelligent young man and possesses the attributes of a good musician, he is said to be a bit on the "odd" side, living in his own little world, and even to a large imagination. It was further learned that on the same day that [redacted] claimed to have seen his "flying saucer," a Cleveland firm was sending up sky rockets as part of an advertising campaign. Offering rewards to the finders of these rockets. It was determined that [redacted] saw these rockets and attempted to obtain one.

(2) [redacted] Sighting: On the evening of the same day (27 June) proceeded to Willoughby, Ohio, to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. [redacted]. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] willingly gave an account of the sighting that had made in late July or August of 1955. They had no knowledge that the undersigned investigator had in his possession a case dossier from the UFORC. In brief, they both repeated to this investigator almost word for word their previous report to the UFORC. However, in the course of discussion following their story the investigator learned that the UFORC has built up this particular case in the report to ATIC. The pictures submitted and as shown in the case dossier are not pictures of the area of Mr. [redacted] home but of an area some distance away. Also, some of the drawings of the UFO sighted are erroneous according to Mr. [redacted], who, apparently, reviewed them for the first time. These were revised in the [redacted] dossier. It was learned during this interview that Mr. [redacted] of the UFORG is leading people to believe that he and the UFORC organization are official USAF Investigators. They present some type of card for identification, believed to be a USAF Reserve card of some sort.

In view of the fact that Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] repeated almost the exact story submitted in the UFO case dossier; that Mr. [redacted] appears familiar with known types of aircraft; and that he still seemed frightened almost a year after his sighting, the undersigned investigator was left with the impression that [redacted] in sincere and truthful and that he did see something unusual and unknown.

(3) [redacted] Sighting: In the latter part of the day (23 June), an attempt was made to contact Mr. [redacted], who appears to be a sort of "chairman" and self-designated chief UFO Investigator of the organization in question. Tamasmuch as Mr. [redacted] was most personally prepared the UFO cases and illustration in the dossier, it was important that some background information on this individual be obtained. It was determined that [redacted], and had not lived in the address given to ATIC. [redacted] address was obtained from his previous landlord. However, [redacted] an insurance

salesman, was out of town. Discussions with wife, who also
observed the sighting with her husband, produced some interesting
information on this case. Mrs. was of the opinion that,
although not positive, the object she observed was an aircraft.
Further, she gave this investigator the impression that her husband
got interested in UFO's merely as a hobby, but that his interest
"now has grown out of hand."

7. In accordance with a pre-arranged plan for conducting this series of inter-
views, the final interview was had with Mr. and Mr. who conducted the investigations
the director of the UFORG. He, Mr. and Mr. contacted the various people who made sightings on
these dates (22 October 1955). From all the witnesses accounts this investigator
is lead to believe that all those sightings were of some type of aircraft. Strong
support is lent this statement because of numerous and constant aircraft flying in
and around Cleveland, from both private and municipal airfields. With USAF units
located in the Cleveland Municipal Airport there are any numerous types of craft
flying out of the Cleveland area, i.e., advertising blimps, helicopters, transports,
jet types to name only a few.

8. At the conclusion of interviews, this investigator emphasized to all inter-
viewed that although submission of some UFO cases and reports from private citizens
and organizations is appreciated by the Air Force, ATIC and other delegated AF units
are the only "official" UFO agencies. It was strongly recommended that all sightings
should be made to ATIC or the nearest AF base immediately, and that if the sightings
were found to possess merit, action to initiate an official USAF investigation
through the 4602d AISS and other pertinent units, who have trained investigators to
handle these cases, would be taken.

c. CONCLUSIONS:

9. Case: Mr. an impressionable young man with an over-
active imagination did observe some unusual or explainable phenomena, but let his
imagination run riot to build up a story of a flying saucer landing and its occu-
pants talking to him to such an extent that he now believes or alleges to believe
this fantastic story himself. Considered an "eccentric" or "psychological manifes-
tation" UFO report.

10. Case: This was the only case of the four that did not disclose any
discrepancies between the original and present UFO report. No firm or definite con-
clusion can be made due to lack of further information and the difficulty of getting
additional facts from the sources due to the length of time elapsing from the first
report. Considered an "unknown."

11. Case: From his obvious susceptibility to suggestion, and description
of his sighting *500 feet from the ground - a light beam appearing shining towards
the ground," the object is considered an "aircraft" preparatory to landing, and will
be placed in that category.

12. Case: Apparently an aircraft, but insufficient information.

13. General: All the individuals associated with the UFORG appeared to be
people who, although good American citizens, have vivid imaginations and sincerely
believe they are helping the UFO program by conducting their own investigation and
analyses. It is further concluded that in all future reports from this organization

4.

will probably border on the fantasy side rather than on the logical or factual so
necessary in resolving reported sightings.

D. RECOMMENDATIONS:

14. The UFO cases investigated herein be entered individually in the UFO case
files under the following categories:

a. (Eccentric) i.e. Other
b. Unknown

Forward

We of the U.F.O.R.G. are civilians interested in the security of these United States. We operate on a non-profit basis and the time of our investigations is donated. Two of our members are engineering students at Case Institute of Technology, Cleveland, Ohio while the others represent firms in the Insurance and Business fields. The committee is thusly comprised:

We literally stumbled onto a sighting of an unidentified flying object late in 1955 and ever since we have been studying and investigating the matter in the interest of our country's defense.

The sighting-reports included in this paper are to be found in their original form, as affidavits, in our files. The cases are exact quotes from the lips of the witnesses, and all drawings and/or diagrams are by the witnesses himself or by a U.F.O.G. staff member with the witness as the consultant.

Because the Department of the Air Force has set up the special Project Bluebook, we feel it is our duty as Americans to prepare a complete report of our investigations, findings and conclusions and present to Air Technical Intelligence for evaluation.

As a last word we would like to state that our investigations are by no means complete. We are firmly convinced that a more thorough study of the area involved will turn up other past reports and probably numerous new ones. In this special report to the air force we have not only presented the sighting facts, but also scientific facts that may or may not account for the unusual U.F.O. activity in this one area.

Case File Number One

On October 16, 1955 I was driving north on Kemper Road (in Cleveland) with a girl friend. As I approached the intersection of Kemper and Fairhill at about 7:20 p.m. I noticed four yellowish globes over the trees. They were very bright and stood out in the dark night sky. I pointed them out to my girl friend and the two of us watched the objects execute a gradual turn and disappear to the northeast. The turn was executed "as if the small globes were rigidly attached to a fuselage of some sort."

As soon as possible I phoned my report to other investigators at UFORG. The report was filled but not much was done about it until exactly one week later, Oct. 23, 1955 at 7:15 p.m. - a Pinkerton detective and UFORG member, called me to report a remarkable sighting over the National Malleable Steel Building where he was on duty. Here is the text of his sighting:

[Redacted name]. I am 26 years old, married and have one child. I work for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 1370 Ontario Street, Cleveland 13, Ohio.

On the night of October 22nd, 1955, while I was working at the National Malleable Technical Center Building, located on the northwest corner of Woodland and Woodhill Roads in the city of Cleveland, at approximately 7 p.m. while on my Deere clock found did exit from the west door of the Technical Center Building and proceed to walk slowly due west alongside of a railroad spur toward No. 3 Deere clock station located on the side of a small shanty on the north side of the railroad spur.

Approximately while walking halfway to the shanty I glanced up into the sky. I noticed the sky was very clear and that the stars were shining brightly. There were a few searchlights driving the city. Suddenly I happened to notice a bright orange glow, circular. In shape, about the size of a large marble would look like if extended an average arm's length away from your body. It was traveling towards me due east at a very slow speed and coming earthward at a 45 degree angle. It veered off as it approached closer toward me and as it turned almost parallel to where I was standing it turned due north approximately over east 105th street. At the very time it turned due north, a single engine reciprocating aircraft approached flying from west to east past


- page 8 -

me further away from the orange unidentified
flying object and at a higher altitude. The
single engined plane could be heard very loud
and clear. The orange object produced no audible sound. The orange object, as it turned
north, gave off what appeared to me to be that
of beams of orange light coming from it's bottom
side and traversing toward the earth. It then
continued to proceed due north and disappeared
over the roof tops.

I then continued my rounds, entering the building
as I did, and continued my rounds on the inside
of the building. I left the building again on the
Woodland Avenue entrance and did look up northward
to see the same object coming due south toward me
at a very slow rate of speed. It seemed to flutter
as it approached me. It then turned due west and
proceeded to fly in that direction and disappeared
again over the horizon. It was flying at approximately 500 feet above the ground at all times.

I returned to the building and phoned this sighting to the Civil Aeronautics Flight Patrol Center
on Brookpark Road.

After listening to [redacted] report over the telephone,
I called [redacted]. No sooner did I relate part of the story when [redacted] blurted out the details concerning an unusual
object that he and his wife had seen moving over his home. The
following is [redacted] sighting report:

"At 7:00 or 7:15 p.m. on October 22, 1955 my wife
noted a noise outside. What's that, she asked. I
went outside and faced east. Object was flying low
to east just over the trees of neighbor's back yard.
I used 5X40 glasses and saw the following for about
one-half minute:

Object was large, as wide as the average house, low,
moving slowly, and made a guff, coarse noise, and
a faint vibration. It is best described by me as a
flying contraption. The row of yellow lights were not
in a perfectly straight line, but described a curve.
There was something odd in the left-hand surface. At
one instant, I saw a horizontal slit dividing this
object into two sections, upper and lower, and at
another instance I thought there was one row of lights
below and one row above this separation. The object was
at tree-top height and looked as if it were coming
down.

Believing that this sightings of [redacted] and [redacted] might
be related, and in view of the fact that the objects involved
were unusual and not in accordance with the C.A.A.'s altitude laws


- page 9 -

the three of us decided to investigate. Here are our results from the original report:

"Witnesses:
A. Mrs. [redacted] Cleveland.

Location: We were driving west when I first saw it.
Motion: To me, it was very still, and when I saw it fifteen minutes later at East 9th & Woodland, I noted that it had not moved, very far. It must have been very slow.

Color: A row of yellow lights, south to north in direction and object moving west to east.

Shape: To me it was very long; a row of lights.

Sound: No sound at all.

Altitude: It was very low to me.

Lights: It had no green and red wing lights and no tail lights. I lived on an Air Force Base. Would War II to me it was not like an airplane. It had no body, tail, or wing that could be seen.

B. Mr. [redacted] [address]

Location: Same

Motion: Moving west to east.

Color: Just had a glimpse. Row of yellow lights.

Shape: Row of lights.

Sound: None

Altitude: Close to 1,000 feet.

Lights: None

C. [redacted] Cleveland.

Time: 7:00 p.m. Saturday, October 22, 1955.

Motion: Very slow, west to east, over stores across the street.

Color: Just a single row of yellow lights.

Shape: None. Saw no wing or tail or body.


- page 10 -

Sound: No sound.

Altitude: Was it 200 feet high?
No, hell, no. Just as high as any plane.

Lights: Any wing or tail lights? Green or red?
No, just the yellow lights.

We all stood out and watched it and we did not get excited about it. Though it had something to do with the football game. (He picked up a radiator thermo bulb and, facing east, with ends south to north, pushed it west to east, to show how the lights moved.)

Note: Sighting was near this location.

D. Mr. [redacted], Euclid, Ohio, Mayfield Country Club, South

Time: 7:00 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22, 1955.

Motion: 
Color: .....None. He didn't go outside.
Shape:
Lights:

Sound: I heard this unusual sound. It vibrated all over the place.

Altitude: Low, many airplanes fly over here. This was different.

E. Resident: [redacted], across from Mayfield Club

Time: 7:00 p.m. Sat., Oct. 22, 1955.

Motion:
Color: .....None. He did not go outside.
Shape:
Lights:

Sound: We were watching T.V. The sound was loud and slow. It must have been low. It disturbed my T.V. set. Odd that it would do that, disturb my T.V. set; many planes fly over here and that never happens.

F. [redacted], Parma, Ohio

Time: 7:00 to 7:10 p.m. Sat., Oct. 22, 1955

Location: I saw it to the north.

Motion: Slow.

Here is the text from the document:

"Does the blimp have green and red port and starboard lights?"

"Yes, they are inside and can be seen from the backside, can cause odd color. The green and red lights while flashing might give the appearance of two rows of yellow lights. I am almost sure it was a blimp."

C. Mr. [redacted], Goodyear Wingfoot Airship Base, Akron, O.

Thursday, Oct. 27, 1955

"If you saw a row of yellow lights as you looked up from your house, would you take it to be a blimp?"

"No. You might see some light in a blimp cabin light, but it would be pretty dim."

"Did you have a blimp out that night?"

"No."

"Any other blimp base in the general area?"

"No. We used to have one in Detroit last year."

"Would that blimp be required to carry red and greenlight as standard equipment?"

"Yes. It also had a sign on the side. We have those advertising frames, if you used 10 frames you might get, then, a view of 10 lights in a row."

"Would green and red lights be required and visible?"

"Yes. At a distance (long) you might not see them."

D. Mr. [redacted], Night Traffic, Cleveland Air Taxi, Inc.,
Phone: [redacted]

Nov. 1, 1955

"Our helicopters are grounded after 5:30 p.m."

"Do they make a vibratory noise?"

"They make a slapping noise. Noise can't be heard over 750 feet, normally."


- page 13 -

Do they have a row of yellow lights?
No.

Do they have red and green running lights?
Yes, a green, red and yellow flashing light.

By the description of witnesses and our investigation, then, we knew that the object(s) involved were not: commercial or private planes, advertising planes, blimps, helicopters, or astronomical phenomena. As a last measure, we took the case file to the Air Force Filter Center in Canton, Ohio. The text follows:

"Thursday, November 16, 1955. A Sgt. Lee, after hearing my report, called the G.A.A.A. in Cleveland and then went into conference with officials at the base. Each time he did this, he emerged with an explanation to the sighting however further analysis revealed all of these were inadequate. When Sgt. Lee emerged for the last time, he had this to say:

"Well, we think what you saw was an unidentified flying object. Most of the U.F.o.s travel at tremendous rates of speed, make sharp turns, and have a rotational motion that is not in that class. However, from your account, this was a U.f.o. No other explanation fits. If the sighting can be explained it will be in time. If it cannot be explained, we have orders to release nothing on it. It will be sent on to higher authorities at Wright Field."

In Conclusion

We of the Unidentified Flying Object Research Council are not fantasy-minded people nor are we easily fooled. We are, however, alert to the possibilities of truth which may take on the appearance of fantasy. We have investigated these three case files as thoroughly as is possible for civilians. The facts speak for themselves as each case file substantiates and correlates each other case file.

Our primary concern is the security and defense of America; as a country and as a whole made up of individuals each of whom has certain inalienable rights. It is our conclusion that these undeniable flying objects are not only real, but a potential threat to the United States and possibly the world. Our research has proven that UFO's pay no attention to C.A.A. altitude regulations and they even go so far as to hover over people's homes frightening them to death. This, in itself, is dangerous.

The UFORC believes that some type of defense against the UFO should be made, just in case...no matter how feasible it may seem. At least the public should be informed of this potential danger so that the masses will be alert. We do NOT say that invasion or active aggression is near. But we DO say that aircraft alien to this planet are moving close to our property and the mere existence of such aircraft poses a threat to an unprepared people.

The latest air force report on UFO's, released by Secretary of the Air Force Charles on Oct. 26, 1955, stated: "On the basis of this study we believe that no objects such as flying saucers have overflown the United States". Call then what you will, but members of our research group have seen them and we have investigated other observations to a minute degree. We offer the results of our probe as evidence that unidentified flying objects DO EXIST.

All of the persons mentioned in this report are ready and willing to be questioned at any time. As for the UFORC: we are a research-investigation group and not a publishing company. We want no publicity...we only want to help. If we can supplement the air force Project Blue Book in any way now, or in the future, we will be glad to do so.
