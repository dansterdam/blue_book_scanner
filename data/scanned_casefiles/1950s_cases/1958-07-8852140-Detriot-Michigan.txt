6. CSI Comment:
CSI [name redacted], who was interviewed at his place of work, was in the U.S. Army for one year and was released from the Army because, according to him, "I wasn't smart enough." His story and description were vague and confusing. He continually referred to his younger brother [name redacted] to seemingly authenticate his story. Seemingly intelligent and a good student according to his father and older sister, he intensely interested in military life and he stated he intended to make a career of the Armed Forces. When he was questioned as to the possibility that the object might have been a weather balloon, his physics took has a picture of a weather balloon and they have instruments hanging from them. When informed that weather balloons did not necessarily have instruments attached to them, he stated that the object may have been like a balloon but he wasn't sure.

7. Action:
This office contemplates no further action in this matter. Distribution effected as indicated below.
