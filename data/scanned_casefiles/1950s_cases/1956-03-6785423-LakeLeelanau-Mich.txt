I. SOURCE:
Address: Island, Michigan
Age: 22 years
Occupation: Student
Education: 3 years college
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: When interviewed by this investigator, Sheriff Bob White said of SOURCE: "He is the kind of a guy who sees something after someone else told him to look again." In an interview with the SOURCE, it was noted that he had a tendency to exaggerate in his accounts of things he had done and his perception as to depth and size of objects near and far was unreliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "I was in the Dairy Bar at Lake Leelanau pool, when I came in and said to the girl a flying saucer. Two of the other guys (names blacked out) and I went with Jim to his house, and then it disappeared. It didn't look like an airplane, but it changed colors from red to green to white. After we had been watching for about 10 minutes, it just went out. We used a pair of binoculars to look at the object and Jim made a drawing of it. That's the way it looked to me too."

II. RELIABILITY:
SOURCE was a very likable adolescent. He seemed to be quite sincere in his story of his sighting and was as sane and reliable as possible. Sheriff White said that he is level headed and quite reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
"I was at the Dairy Bar in Lake Leelanau about 10:50 (0350) on March 26 when I came running in to report that he had seen a Flying Saucer near his house. Naturally we all went out to take a look. There was a very bright light in the sky, like a very bright star. The only difference was that it changed colors and seemed to be moving erratically through the sky. We watched it for about five minutes after we got there through binoculars (4x) and then it just seemed to fade out. We heard no sound and the object was about the size of a pea at arm's length. Jim said it was crescent shaped with a red-orange glow, but I couldn't see the stem."

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: [Name redacted] came into the Dairy Bar at [location redacted] at about 10:45 P. (C9457) March 26 saying he had seen a flying object. I went with him to his house where we watched a bright star-like object for about five or ten minutes. The object seemed to be crescent-shaped and changed color from red to green to white. He looked at it through binoculars (4x) and Jim drew a sketch of what it looked like. The object was in the west and seemed to jump up and down rapidly before it just seemed to fade away."

II. RELIABILITY: Most of those interviewed, when asked about the reliability of the SOURCE, gave this impression that she was a bit eccentric and easily excited. She was very sure of what she had seen and remarked that it occurred.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "I was sitting in the house sewing last Saturday evening at about 10:30 PM (0103302 April 56) when my three dogs started barking and carrying on out in the yard. I went to the back door to see what was the matter. When I opened the door, all three dogs nearly knocked me down trying to get into the house. Their color was more white and all their hair was standing on end. I stepped out into the yard and saw a huge reddish-orange object, big as a bushel basket at arm's length, hovering over the trees and Lake Leelanau. I rushed back into the house and reported it to the radar base. When I got back to the window it disappeared behind some clouds."

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE is considered by all concerned as an excellent source of information. Takes with personal at the radar site diligence that he is considered as one of "the best". Mr. ████ was very sincere in his opinions and eager to help as much as possible.

III. SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "Before I say anything false, let me make it clear to you that I'm almost certain that the object I've seen in a star. My wife and I have seen this object quite often in the last few days, in fact on every clear night, from 10:30 to 11:30 in the evening while driving from Traverse City (GRR 2225) back to Empire (GRR 5049).

It stands out and is quite bright. In color, at times, however, it seems to go out (the light) and then reappear. In color it appears from a bright blue-white to orange. I haven't heard any noise along with the sightings. The object is about the size of a pea at arm's length and is seen in the west. It doesn't seem to move fast enough so that you can visually observe it, but in the course of an evening or an hour's time you can tell that it has dropped toward the horizon. The only reason I even mentioned that I had seen it was that I'd heard so much about "flying objects" being seen around here. I feel almost certain that the object is a star."

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:   "We were driving from Traverse City to Lake Leelanau, when we noticed this bright, round object in the west. It was red-orange in color and seemed to be moving. "We stopped the car and watched it for about 20 minutes. It seemed to be an angle of about 20° from us and was heading into the west and may from us. There wasn't any sound or other strange features about it. It was about 10:25 (C3252) when we first spotted it and it disappeared at about 10:45 (010345 April 1956) either behind some hills or clouds, or the horizon."

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE seems to be very sincere in his account of the sighting. During the interview, he stated that he had seen this object for a period of about 4 nights, but when reticent to being labeled a "crackpot".

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "On the 26th of March I, observed this strange, bright object at about 300 yards in the west. It was about the size of a fifty cent piece at arm's length and was reddish with yellow or white edges. In changed colors while I was watching. It would appear to have legs or rays projecting from it. I could hear a faint sound like a high-pitched whine or a motor. It receded and faded away from me, disappearing in the west about 11:00 PM (0400Z), about 40 minutes after I had first seen it. It seemed to disappear under the horizon. I was observing the object with a pair of 6x binoculars. The sky was clear, without any noticeable clouds. I'm leery and cautious, as well as frightened of the object. Those are the reasons I noticed it in the first place. I didn't want to be called a crackpot, so I waited a couple of nights to be sure of what I saw."

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE is considered very reliable by all persons interviewed, as well as this investigator. Probably one of the most reliable persons to have sighted the object.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "I had seen this bright object in the sky previously and was watching for it at about 11 PM (0400Z) on the night of 31 March 1956. The object was about the size of a dime, while on a stretch of road east of Lake Leelanau. Then I listened closely, I could hear a sound like that of a jet thrust. It appeared to move and then stop intermittently in a northwesterly direction. I watched it for quite a wide and it appeared to fade occasionally into the horizontal and finally faded out entirely. The night was quite clear and I had no optical aids through which to view the object. I happened to be visiting my folks in Lake Leelanau at the time which accounts for the distinctly in the address and the place of sighting."

II. RELIABILITY: As the investigator as well as the SOURCE in this part,
I find it rather difficult to give an estimate of my own reliability. My eye-
sight and hearing are normal and I will give as clear a picture as possible as
to what I found during conversations, etc.

III. SOURCE DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "Upon my arrival in Traverse City,
Michigan, I immediately drove to the Empire AF Station to interview those at
the station who had seen the object. 1/Lt Dalton Balko voluntarily accompanied
me on a trip to the section of the county where the object had been sighted.
At 04, 23/54 April 1954, 1/Lt Balko and I began the drive to Suttons Bay from
Traverse City. We first interviewed the proprietor of a general store, but
not at this time. Later, we were stopped at a gas station with the same
effect. However, as we were leaving, we entered another store. After a short
talk and interview (as I recall) we received directions to the dairy bar in
Lake Leelanau, where three others who had seen the object were at present.
(Near arriving at the Dairy Bar, Lt Balko and I noticed a brightly shining star
in the west and commented on the possibility of it being the UFO). We entered
and questioned the three boys, details of which are detailed in parts 3, 4, and 5. While we were
still at the Dairy Bar, one of the boys stopped outside for a moment and came
back in announcing that he had seen a bright object. Lt Balko and I rushed outside
to view the object. As soon as it was pointed out to us, we both thought it
was a star and wondered how anyone could mistake it for anything else. There
was some disagreement on the part of the boys as to whether or not it was the
UFO.    While we were watching, the object disappeared behind a cloud and most
of those present thought it had "just faded out". Lt Balko and I then went to
Leland (GKEA 1401) to interview the Nesslaun County Sheriff, Bob White. Another
witness was, according to Sheriff White, a certain man who had seen the object.
However, when interviewed, Sheriff White stated that he only saw the object as
seen was the brightly shining star visible from his office window. This was
also obtained to be the only object as the others in Lake Leelanau had seen.
Don Gordon, the editor of a small-town newspaper in Leland also arrived on the
scene and stated that he had never seen anything more suspicious than the planet
Venus, which was at its brightest at this time of the year.    During the course
of the interview, a check was made with the radar site to see if there had been
any further sightings.    It was discovered that no unusual conditions had been
observed that they considered to be the object low in the west. Lt Balko, Editor
Gordon, and I rushed to the Lake Michigan shore and from there observed a faint
light in the western sky at an elevation of about 15°. The light seemed to change
color from red to gold--red to green and occasionally seemed to "wink". While
this object seemed to be the planet Venus, much lower in the sky at 11:30 PM
(0330), than before, this was not conclusive, the haze or conditions were
completely obscured the object."

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with the 752nd ACW Sqdn weather log and Traverse City Airport revealed no significant meteorological data which could be related to the UFOB sightings.

2. S/Sgt Delfuss contacted personnel of the 752nd ACW Sqdn and it was determined that there were no radar files made during the period covered by these reports.

3. Extensive informal questioning of personnel of the 752nd ACW Sqdn revealed that the majority of all personnel who had seen any unusual object thought that it was merely a bright star and nothing in the UFOB line at all.

4. S/Sgt Delfuss and 1/Lt Balko of the radar site spent from 0l, 2400Z April 1955 until 05 0500Z April 1955 interviewing persons in the area (see Part Ten) in an effort to determine the cause of the sightings.

5. Sheriff Bob White of Leelanau County was interviewed in an effort to determine reliability of the persons questioned. Results are included in the individual reports, where applicable.

6. There were no known aircraft operating in the vicinity at the time of sightings.

7. On 9 April 1956, S/Sgt Delfuss interviewed Professor Everett R. Phelps of the Wayne University (Detroit) Astronomy Department. The following facts and comments were received from Dr. Phelps:

a. In relation to the sighting by Mrs. [REDACTED] (See Part Five), the moon was Full at the time of her sightings. It was determined that the back door of her house faced east and that the moon would be rising at the approximate time of her sightings. Although this does not explain the dog turning white and their standing on end, it is reasonable to assume that Mrs. Dillard was viewing the moonrise.

b. Possible explanations for the color-changing of the object:
   (1) Ordinary binoculars have no chromatic correction.
   (2) There is a slight varying of refraction due to unequal heating of the atmosphere near the horizon.

c. In relation to the sketch by [REDACTED], the planet Venus at this time is in a state or stage whereby, when viewed through binoculars, or a telescope, it would appear as a crescent-shaped object. There is no explanation for the stem or tail, astronomically speaking.

8. 1/Lt Schiele, who had been mentioned as a possible SOURCE by Sgt Deluder was on leave at the time of the investigation and could not be contacted.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. It is the opinion of the preparing investigator that the UFOB described in this report probably was the planet Venus for the following reasons:

a. When interviewed SOURCES and companions pointed to a brightly shining object and said "that looks like it". The object was, in this instance, pointing, in Janat, Venus.

b. Most of the other SOURCES stated that the object was observed in a position corresponding to that of Venus at this time of year.

c. Comments of Sheriff Bob White on the reliability of those concerned was "They are honest people who would report what they saw, but are inclined to exaggerate and overemphasize. In some cases." Speaking of this group and his companions, he stated that "none of them probably saw half of what they said they did."

d. Those individuals who were considered as reliable, as a rule, thought that "it could be a hoax". This investigator concluded that the object in question was an unusually brilliant astronomical body. No sounds were heard at any time and the object never attained a size of anything larger than a spot at arm's length. This investigator would not attempt to draw inconsistencies in size, shape, and color to individual variations in perceptiveness. One person only interviewed while actually observing the object was later asked to describe it as to size. The answer was "Oh, about the size of a baseball (5 or 6 arm's length)." And then after being taken outside to interview the object, again "Oh, it's only the size of a small peat," which it was.

f. [Partially illegible] considered a very reliable SOURCE, stated that he had thought it was a star all along, but when hearing so much about "flying objects" reported his sightings to the Commanding, 752nd ACGF Sqdn.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the investigator that this sighting was astronomical in nature. It is the opinion of this headquarters that the information contained in this report substantiates a conclusion of WAS ASTRONOMICAL.

RADAR STATION INVESTIGATES WAVE OF SAUCER REPORTS IN
LELAND, MICHIGAN: Major Homer D. Champlin, commanding officer of the 250nd
A.C.&W. Squadron at Keflavik, Michigan, said that the base received reports of an unidentified light in the sky between 10:30 and 11:00 on the night
of March 27th. The best report was supplied by [name redacted], who said that the
light, appeared to go red and white, slightly larger than a star, when seen
with the naked eye; but when Wurn watched it through binoculars, he saw that
the object was shaped like "an upright mushroom", with the "stem" red-orange
and the top white. Wurn said it moved slowly for about 15 minutes, and when
it disappeared rapidly in the western sky about 40 degrees above the horizon, Major Champlin ordered two of his officers to interview all persons who reported
seeing this object.

War-16-Detroits City & Leelaneu County, Mich.--Persons in at-
tached location reported between 10:30 and 11 p.m. an unidentified object
seen 10:30 and 11 p.m. Air Force Major Homer D. Champlin said his
250th A.C.&W. Squadron base at Keflavik received several reports of the
light. "No aircraft were reported in the vicinity and
the object did not show up on radar scope." Capt. James Wurn gave the
most detailed account; it first appeared at first just to be a
red and white light, somewhat larger than a star, but on looking
through binoculars he saw it was shaped like a mushroom, with the stem
red-orange and the top white. Wurn said it moved slowly 15 minutes, then
disappeared rapidly into the western sky about 40 degrees above the
horizon." Wurn, who with Capt. James Chernowski and 1st Lt. Gardner. Another observer, Charnicki, followed. Capt. Wurn for several minutes investigated the object by the taking of bar due. She reported the object in the same manner. (Island, Leelaneu Saucer Reporting, 3/30).

I. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted] Michigan (GCIA 1401)
Age: 23 years
Occupation: Metal Worker
Education: High School Graduate
Qualifications: Coastal Artillery for two years.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE seemed to be quite serious in his belief that the object in question was not an aircraft or a star and did not seem to be trying to "put one over on the Air Force". A conversation with Sheriff Bob Trefil of Leelanau County as to SOURCE's reliability confirmed in the understanding that SOURCE is imaginative and tends to exaggerate his experiences and observations.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "At approximately 10:45 PM (03452) on March 26 (1955), I was driving from Lake Leelanau (GJE 1758) to Leland, Michigan (GJE 1401). Upon going out of my car at home, I noticed a bright object at about 40° elevation and 300° azimuth. I watched it for about five minutes and then drove back to Lake Leelanau to get my three buddies. La Verne Peterson, August Shortrowski, and Pat Gardner. We returned to my house at about 11:00 PM (04002) and looked at the object for another five minutes. I was visually and through a field glass looking at the object seemed to be a crescent with a red-orange star. It was about the size of a dime at arm's length. It seemed to hold still, but after looking at it for about two or three minutes, it moved away from us and up and down very quickly. It finally just faded out. I didn't hear any sounds."
