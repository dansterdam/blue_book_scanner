I. SOURCE:
Address: Lake Leelanau, Michigan
Age: 19 years
Occupation: Student  
Education: Presently a college freshman.
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a very likable adolescent. He seemed to be quite reliable and his account to be as accurate as possible. Sheriff White said that he is level headed and quite reliable.

III. CIRCUMSTANCES: According to his story, on March 26 when the sky was clear and the wind was calm, the source was walking along the road near his home about 10:55 (0330Z) on March 26 when he noticed something in the sky. At first he thought it was an airplane, but as he watched it, it became clear that it was not an airplane, but a very bright star. The only difference was that it changed colors and seemed to be hovering over a nearby hill. He continued to watch it for about 15 minutes. During this period it suddenly became smaller and went out of sight. He said he heard no sound and the object was about the size of a half moon at its largest. He could not detect any details or markings on the object and it did not seem to have a tail or wings. The whole sighting lasted only about 15 minutes.

II. RELIABILITY: The source was quite excited over the possibility that the object might be something from outer space. Sheriff White was not familiar with the source.
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On March 23, 1956, at about 10:30 P.M., the source was on his way home from a basketball game. As he was driving along the road near Lake Leelanau, he observed an object in the sky which appeared to be quite large and bright. The object seemed to be hovering and then suddenly started to descend rapidly. The source stated that the object was about the size of a house and that it was brighter than a star. The object was observed for about 20-30 seconds and then seemed to fade away. The source stated that he was quite excited and scared at the time and that he had the urge to jump up and down rapidly before it just seemed to fade away.

II. RELIABILITY: Most of those interviewed, when asked about the reliability of this source, conceded that she was a bit eccentric and had mentioned things in the past which could not be verified and therefore did not consider her testimony as irrefutable.

III. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "I was sitting in the house sewing last Saturday evening at about 10:30 p.m. (03-31-56) when the dogs started barking and carrying on outside. They seemed very excited so I went out to see what was causing it. Looking up, I saw a large, bright light in the sky, perhaps about 500 feet up, hovering about, and moving slowly from west to east. The light seemed to be about the size of the full moon and very bright, almost dazzling. I watched it for about 10 minutes, and it kept changing colors from dull red to bright white, to blue-green. Then it shot straight up and disappeared. I went back into the house and reported it to the radar base. I was quite concerned."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Feb. 2-8, A.6627.A123 30-Mar-2-55 Par 6 Gk 
I. SOURCE:
Address: 752nd ACAT Squadron, Empire AF Station, MICHIGAN 
Age: 36 years
Occupation: Civilian Technical Representative
Education: College Graduate
Reliability: Considered reliable by all concerned as a technical representative.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE is considered to be of a high order - one who has a conscientious and sincere interest in unusual aerial phenomena. He is considered as one of the best, most intelligent and unbiased observers in this particular area.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "On the evening of February 7, 1956, at approximately 7:55 p.m. EST, I observed an unidentified object or phenomenon in the sky over Lake Leelanau near the Village of Leland, Michigan.
"The object was first sighted as a bright light, similar to a star, in the western sky. As I observed it, the object seemed to increase in size and intensity. It was definitely larger and brighter than a commercial aircraft landing light would appear at a distance. The object was stationary and remained so for the duration of the observation, which was approximately 10 minutes.
"At times, however, it seemed to go out (blink off) and then reappear. During these apparent 'blinking' periods, the object seemed to split into two or three separate and distinct lights. The color of the light was white, with a slight bluish tinge. It did not seem to pulsate or change color. The night was clear and the visibility excellent.
"It was an unusual sight and seemed to be hovering or suspending itself in the air. I had a good view of it, as it was directly overhead. I feel that I can describe it accurately, as I have observed many aircraft of all types, both military and commercial, during my five years' experience as a civilian technical representative."

II. RELIABILITY SOURCE: According to his own account, he sighted what he believes to be a flying object on the date and in the location mentioned. He appears to be a reputable young man, reporting it due to his sense of public duty. 
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHT: "On the 26th of March I observed some bright lights in the sky. They traveled very rapidly and changed colors while I watched them. At first the object was a steady bright white light. Then it turned to a reddish-orange color. Finally, it changed to a bluish-green shade before disappearing from view. The object was first sighted about 1:00 PM (CDT), about 45 minutes after I had stopped working in the field. I watched the lights for about 3 to 5 minutes. The brightness and color changes were very noticeable.  I noticed it in the north, about 45 degrees above the horizon. It moved in a straight line from north to south. I watched a couple of nights to be sure of what I saw."

I. SOURCE:
Address: Miss Lois Parks, Traverse City, Michigan
Age: 28 years
Occupation: Engineer with Continental Aircraft
Education: College Graduate
Qualifications: Pilot in WWII, still flies light aircraft.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE is considered absolutely reliable by all persons interviewed, as well as this investigator. Probably one of the most reliable reports received to date regarding the sightings.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "If had seen this bright object in the sky not identified, it would have normally have been disregarded as just a freak cloud formation or something of that nature. When I sighted closely, I could hear a sound like that of a jet. There was no tail, no wings, no trail, and no evidence of any method of propulsion. It was stationary, and disappeared completely after a period of 15-20 seconds."

The object was sighted over Lake Leelanau at the time which accounts for the disappearance in the distance and the relative silence of any noises which might have been evident at a closer range. The shape was circular, about 30-35 feet in diameter, and glowed with a bright yellow-white light. The witness watched it from a distance of about 1 mile, and it appeared to be about 1000 feet in altitude. It was seen by this witness and the police chief of Traverse City, Michigan.

Occupation: Operational Intelligence Specialist
Organization: Flight 2-G, 4602d AISS
Sarigon AFB, Vietnam
Age: 24 years
Education: 3 years of college, Technical Intelligence
School at ATIC.

II. RELIABILITY: As the source is an official in this report, I find it reliable. The source appears to be a fully qualified and competent Operational Intelligence Specialist.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Upon arrival in Traverse City, the source was interviewed about a sighting made by two local residents. According to the information given, on 3/30/56 at approximately 0245 hours, two local citizens observed an object in the sky over Lake Leelanau, Michigan. The object was described as being approximately 70 feet in diameter, elliptical in shape, and luminous in appearance. It was reported to have hovered for several minutes and then to have moved rapidly in a northerly direction before disappearing from view. No sound was heard. Both witnesses were reported to be sober, reliable citizens of good standing in the community. They were interviewed separately and their stories were consistent. Both stated that they had never seen anything like this before and were at a loss to explain what they had observed. The source felt that the witnesses were telling the truth and that they had actually observed something unusual in the sky. However, the source was unable to arrive at any conclusion as to the nature of the object sighted.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
F'13 3-C. 46024 AIRS  30-UFOB-2-56 Part 1, 13 Pages
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:
1. A check with the 752nd AC&W Sq and weather for radar and weather data associated with the sightings.
2. Sgt. K., 752nd ACAW Sq, contacted personnel of the 752nd AC&W Sqd and it was determined that there were no radar films made during the period covered by these reports.
3. Extensive informal questioning of personnel of the 752nd AC&W Sqd revealed that there was a possibility that the sightings were connected with the launching of weather balloons from Traverse City at about the time of the sightings.
4. 1/Lt Sahlin and l/Lt Reske of the radar site stated that they had observed a "bright light" at the time of the sightings.
5. In relation to the sketching by Mrs. M - (see Part five), the moon was determined to be the back door of her house faced east and that the moon would be moving in the direction she had sketched. Although this is an end, it is reasonable to assume that Mrs. Dillard was viewing the moon.
Possible explanations for the color-changing of the object: 
(1) Ordinary illumination have no chromatic correction - 
(2) There is a slight varying of refraction due to unequal heating.
In relation to the sketch by Mr. F - (see Part six), the planet Venus at this time was a brilliant object high in the western sky and it would appear as a crescent-shaped object. There is an unaccountable explanation for the phenomenon he observed.
1/Lt Sahlin, who had been mentioned as possible source by Sgt. Dillard, was on leave at the time of the investigation and could not be contacted.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PIO 3-G, 4600d A133
CO REGARDS ON PREPARING OFFICERS:
a. It is the opinion of the preparing investigator that the UFO described in this report probably was the planet Venus for the following reasons:
1. It is a brightly shining object and what looks like it
2. This object was in the sky for a long period of time.
b. Most of the details relating to this object being observed in a stationary position corresponding to that of Venus at this time of year.
c. Comments of Sheriff Bob White on the plausibility of these observations indicate they could be explained as observations of the planet Venus.
d. Those individuals who were considered as probable, sane, reliable, and intelligent observers of this object.
e. From his own observation of the object, this investigator believes the description and details to be consistent with an observation of the planet Venus as the object sighted.
f. The Air Force had thought it was a very reliable sighter, based on information already in their files. This sighter had reported sightings on previous occasions, but the Commander, 73and ACAW Sqdn. said this was the first time the Air Force was notified of this object.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
I concur with the opinion of the investigator that this sighting was probably the planet Venus as described in detail in this report. This conclusion is based on the information presented and seems ASTRONOMICAL.

RADAR STATION INVESTIGATES WAVE OF SAUCER REPORTS IN
LEELANU, MICHIGAN: Major Homer D. Chappell, commanding officer of the 255th 
Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, was directed by D/4C, 
USAF, on 27 March 1956 to investigate a wave of saucer reports in the Leelanau, 
Michigan, area. The case report was supplied by a civilian, who said that the 
object was sighted by several persons, was observed for about 45 minutes, and 
that it maneuvered with the naked eye, but when Chappell watched it through binoculars,
the object disappeared. Then Chappell said he saw a big, bright, white light hovering motionless,
then it began to move slowly and then rapidly accelerate and disappear. He said the
object did not appear to be an aircraft and that it defied explanation.

"At approximately 10:45 I. (20 March 1956) I was driving along Leland to Traverse City. About 10 miles north of Leland, on a west road, I observed a bright metallic, disc-shaped object hovering at an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 feet altitude. It was approximately 50-75 feet in diameter. I watched it for about 3-5 minutes before it simply faded out. I didn't hear any sounds."
