MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Balloon-shaped Object Reported at Stockton Naval Supply Annex,
Stockton, California, 1 January 1951.

A reliable government agency has furnished information to the effect that on 1 January 1951, a red and green balloon-shaped object reportedly descended upon the Stockton Naval Supply Depot, Stockton, California. This object exploded upon hitting the ground, but a part of it remained to burn fiercely until extinguished by Naval security guards. The residue was recovered and has been transmitted to the FBI laboratory for examination.

No information concerning the origin of this object is available other than the recovery of a bamboo ring from the debris, which would suggest the possibility of tropical or oriental construction. Additional information will be forwarded upon receipt. (B-2)

1. Your attention is invited to the enclosed copy of letter dated 12 February 1951, received from 5D-OSI, this command, pertaining to the subject. This matter has been investigated based upon the information presented. It was found that typical high altitude balloons often incorporate an explosive cap for the purpose of disconnecting the mechanical equipment used with the balloons at a predetermined altitude. Malfunctioning of the electrical circuit may explain the explosion explained in the enclosed letter.

2. The personnel connected with high altitude and weather research at this command have no knowledge of any bamboo rings on the various types of balloons now in use.

3. It is requested that action be taken to obtain additional details on this incident and this command be advised accordingly.

1. Reference is made to FBR dated 8 February 1951 in the above captioned matter.

2. The FBI has advised that a laboratory examination of the evidence submitted reflects that the "balloon-shaped" object was probably a home-made "hot air" balloon. No fingerprints of value for comparison purposes were found on the bamboo ring and nothing of particular significance was noted with respect to the wires and other materials of construction which would suggest a possible source for these materials.

3. The Air Material Command has been informed of this matter.

    reportedly upon hitting the ground and almost com-
