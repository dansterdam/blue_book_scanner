MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Balloon-shaped Object Reported at Stockton Naval Supply Annex, Stockton, California, 1 January 1951.

A reliable government agency has furnished information to the effect that on 1 January 1951, a red and green balloon-shaped object reportedly descended upon the Stockton Naval Supply Depot, Stockton, California. This object exploded upon hitting the ground, but a part of it remained to burn fiercely until extinguished by Naval security guards. The residue was recovered and has been transmitted to the FBI laboratory for examination.

No information concerning the origin of this object is available other than the recovery of a balloon-like ring from the debris, which would suggest the possibility of tropical or oriental construction. Additional information will be forwarded upon receipt. (U-2)

1. Your attention is invited to the enclosed copy of letter dated 12 February 1951, received from SD-CO05, this command, pertaining to the subject. This matter has been investigated based upon the information presented, and it was found that certain high altitude balloons often incorporate an explosive cap for the purpose of descending the mechanism controlling the balloons as determined in the incident explained in the enclosed letter.

2. The personnel connected with high altitude and weather research at this command have no knowledge of any unobserved rings on the various types of balloons now in use.

3. It is requested that action be taken to obtain additional details on this incident and this command be advised accordingly.

1. Reference is made to R2t dated 8 February 1951 in the above captioned matter.
2. The Air Material Command at Wright Field, Ohio, has made an analysis of the data submitted and reflects that the "balloon-shaped" object was probably a home-made "toy air" balloon. No fingerprints of value for comparison purposes were found on the bamboo ring and nothing of particular significance was noted with respect to the wires and other materials of construction which would indicate a probable source for these materials.
3. The Air Material Command has been informed of this matter.

2. The following additional information is furnished as a matter of interest to your headquarters:

"1. On 1 January 1951 a red and green balloon-shaped object reportedly descended upon the Stockton, California, vicinity. Shortly after a dull roar was heard, the object exploded. Upon lifting the cloud an item which appeared to be about 6 feet in length was found. No other evidence of the 'balloon' was forwarded to the Air Force investigation.

"2. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has advised that examination of the evidence submitted revealed the object was not a 'flying saucer' but the remains of a Japanese balloon, which was attached to a small paper container and some wire. The container and wire, which showed no evidence of burning, were preserved for possible further examination.

"3. No additional information to the fact that information contained herein has been derived from sources other than USAF. In accordance with paragraph 3a, AFR 200-2, this information will not be made outside of USAF channels."
