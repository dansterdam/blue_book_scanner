MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Balloon-shaped Object Reported at Stockton Naval Supply Annex, Stockton, California, 1 January 1951.

A reliable government agency has furnished information to the effect that on 1 January 1951, a red and green balloon-shaped object reportedly descended upon the Stockton Naval Supply Depot, Stockton, California. This object exploded upon hitting the ground, but a part of it remained to burn fiercely until extinguished by Naval security guards. The residue was recovered and has been transmitted to the FBI laboratory for examination.

No information concerning the origin of this object is available other than the recovery of a balloon-like ring from the debris, which would suggest the possibility of tropical or oriental construction. Additional information will be forwarded upon receipt. (U-2)
