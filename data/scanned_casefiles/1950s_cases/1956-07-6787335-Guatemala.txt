"SEVERAL POLICEMEN ASSURE THEY SAW A FLYING SAUCERS"

In the sky over finca San Luis Buena Vista, an ambulant police squad affirm having seen four flying saucers whiz by, travelling northward in low formation and at high speed.

News of this event was received by telegraph at National Police Headquarters yesterday where no further information was given save that the report wasn't detailed nor did it say if all the members of the squad "saw" the fantastic machine in action.

The incident took place at exactly 1100 hours when the squad was carrying out its regular activities.

"LUMINOUS OBJECT IN THE FORM OF A CIGARETTE"
SAID TO HAVE BEEN SEEN

Mr. Manuel G. Leal V., teacher of primary school, affirms having witnessed on the night of last Sunday, together with his brother, "a luminous object in the form of a cigarette 'zigzagging' across the sky at rather high speed", and contacted this with several police agents of Escuintla state about having seen flying saucers.

Professor Leal, who lives in Santa Maria de Jesus, department of Sacatepequez, points out that "the object emitted light flames of a pale red color from behind, and rose towards the North until it was out of sight. As I live near the National Airport I discard the possibility that it might have been a plane", says Mr. Leal.
