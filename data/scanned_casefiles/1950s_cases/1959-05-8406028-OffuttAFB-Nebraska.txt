PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

The text in the form fields is mostly illegible, with only a few partially readable words. The form appears to be a standard UFO sighting report document with sections for:

1. Date
2. Location
3. Date-Time Group
4. Type of Observation
5. Photos
6. Source
7. Length of Observation
8. Number of Objects
9. Course
10. Brief Summary of Sighting
11. Comments
12. Conclusions

The bottom of the form shows "ATIC FORM 329 (REV 25 SEP 53)"

The summary section appears to have some text, but it is too blurry to confidently transcribe.
