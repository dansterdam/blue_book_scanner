Here is the text I can read from the document:

Illegible

Nov 4 03 48 55

27424
4-4x2a

"Illegible" is written for the majority of the text as most of the document appears to be very faint or blurry and cannot be clearly read.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: Some parts of the text are partially illegible or cut off at the edges, so I will transcribe what I can clearly read]

TOP LINE (partially cut off):
... JACK ... VILLE, FL ...

FIRST FULL PARAGRAPH (partially legible):
... F. SOME ... LIGHT ... ST. A. ... OBJECT LOOKED LIKE ... LIGHTS ...
... STOPPED OVER ... LIGHT MAY ... FT. 8 ... PER VISUAL A.

MIDDLE SECTION (partially legible):

BOTTOM SECTION (partially legible):

There is a vertical stamp/marking on the right side of the document that appears to read:
NOV 1955
07 21

The document appears to be a typewritten report with some sections blacked out or obscured.
