1. Subject correspondence received from General Schwitzer's office is submitted for necessary action, with the following report which is based a reply:
a. Source cannot give exact date or time, only that incident took place sometime in June or July, 1956.
b. No properly solve any UFO case, immediate reporting of the incident is necessary for on-the-spot investigations. A matter of a few days' delay can render the investigations worthless.
c. Cannot comment on the "will-o'-the-wisp lights" and "Ghost" fire reported seen in an Australian marsh, although the phenomenon is typically characteristic of ball-shaped gaseous glow. An electrical discharge, often referred to as St. Elmo's fire, and associated with swamps and particularly if methane gas (CH4) is in the area.

Dear sir:
I have written that I haven't written you before now. I'll try to be as complete as I can concerning the lapse of time, however, and perhaps the details will explain something of the delay.

I cannot fix the exact date - perhaps it could be made on the basis of a Saturday night - that is Sunday morning of the month of June of early to mid-June of 1955. 

A specialist 2rd class at the time. Army. I had been dating a girl in Staunton, virginia, and would hitchhike or take a bus there every chance I could. I had a car which was fairly often as our free time at the post was pretty much only on week-ends. On this particular night - having arrived with no money whatsoever in my pockets - except now on my bicycle (some color film and camera equipment - my hobby) a little too late to visit the girl - but with hopes of seeing her the next night - I had hitched a ride with a buddy who lived in Ruckersville (which I did many things on a shoe-string while I was in the army - most of that night I just wandered up and down the various roads in and around Ruckersville - ending up on the road leading out to the girl's house.

The object was first is it from it did not house - until (as I was understand) it was identified as an old-folks home occupied until as I understand it was condemned - this seem to be a solitary light - I noticed a single light glowing somewhere too large to be from a smaller bulb - my car wasn't in use - it was on such an angle that I wondered at this, because section of three roads - (one main road curving and a newer side road) and as I turned onto the side road, I noticed that the hill was obscuring two or three other such lights - at that I had to come to a complete stop, wanting if anything really quite unexplainable had happened at the place - then the light rose a little with a slight swaying motion - and was soon completely obscured from view by an extremely heavy overcast completely covering the sky.

I waited as bright as a flare would be and glowing with a steady white flow looking to either side in hopes of seeing anything that might be attached to the lights. I did not determine some sort of detached from the light - and it didn't mean much, however, since the night was clear, but cloudy - and the lights seemed to contrast quite sharply outlined - black was the obscuring cloud cover. If continuing, chances were - and the low exposure of the color film I that it would be too much time attempting to get it up in the darkness - in all, it I remember there were a certain number on the road (two story a near the entrance foothold) I wondered whether they were some on the ground â€“ (but they assuring they were at this distance) were some presumably did to the tree - but they (assuring they were at the distance) were much to some to form far from rating. 

The highest light seemed a little above one of the others - until I contacted the tree, because the lights seemed to glow infront of what I

Transcribing the text from the document:

could see of the tree - it being lit slightly - to see a semi-silhouette of the upper branches. Consequently I placed the lights in the yard of the house in a semi-circular arrangement 200 yards away from the object.

At this point I remember reading an article sometime previously in a magazine in which it was described how experiments conducted on various sightings during similar conditions - (if I am enclosing the article - as I have - it was subsequently relocated it) -. 

This was in 1956 - just prior to my separation. About two in the morning - from the crest of the aforementioned hill on which I stood I was facing downhill and could see the distant glow of Washington DC.

I watched the lights for about five to seven minutes - I timed them - but have since forgotten the exact sequence of events. As light began to leave us and dimmers without dimming began to bob sideways a little more still slowly - almost erratically - and begin to settle down - still more, to the ground - there was no sound that I could detect during this - or any other sensation that the lights were not going to reappear. I saw them go down the hill (I didn't up until this time, I was puzzled by their actions and thought too, that they would be explained if I continued to watch them - when I reached the spot where I had thought they were I could see no sign of them. And I couldn't see any life - and to explain this - to a desk-sergeant. 

I was back into town - thinking of little coffee-shop - and the proprietor seemed strangely convinced that I was all worked up over nothing - and I was getting excited over nothing - so I let it go.

As I recall, there was at that time a great deal of expertly authenticated information confirming that such sightings had taken place and were investigated by highly trained Army posts of strange high-flying green and red lights - that were irrecusable, but I dismissed and it was my mind - I know very well the fact across - finding by the qualified distance - with definite discussions surrounding the observed light proven show was illuminated from behind - with definite discussion surrounding the observed light proven was illuminated from behind - I hope this can clarify the chance that you get - otherwise would - further delay in notifying you - There was at that time so much publicity and general non-believing of the "Flying Saucer" business that I felt that I would be just taking up your time - now I am not so sure.

Sincerely yours -

Here is a copy of the article mentioned in relation to the lighter - another copy of this article but does not contain the habit of reading these magazines - but happened to have sent from FATE magazine (AND) August 1956. (true stories of the strange and the unknown) -

MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS
OF AUSTRALIA
by -------

"Ever since white man has never heard of phenomenon familiar to nearly all australians. a visible phenomenon occasionally seen about night with a bright oscillation light shoots up from the horizon, travels rapidly over the skies for some distance and disappears rather mysteriously. the strange oblong reports that it is watching him.

as the closer one approaches the further it recedes.   a man who has spent nearly 16 yeas in western australia states that mention has been made in station letters of this eerie impression that it is watching him - at a distance. apparently there is no legend associated with the "wim-wim light", as the aborigines call it, the words "wim-wim" signify seeing has no meaning. riding his horse, said the eerie luminosity and chase it. in his excitement he ran his horse into a fence, was thrown violently to the ground and dazed for some time.

an otherwise reliable source, a dentist who lives in goulburn, new south wales, writes that he saw from his car two bright lights in the sky about the size of a soup plate, hovering over a paddock and dancing about. then he got out of his car, walked through a paddock and under the lights, and succeeded in getting near enough to see that the light was suspended about eight or ten feet above the ground. suddenly it soared to one side and was gone."

Transcription of the text:

light rent "just ahead of him all the time and vanished when he approached the old lime road" Another old line says that "it passed directly overhead at a very low altitude, from west to east, over the route, near Boukc, in northwest new south wales. It is observed during the evening and observed again next morning, traveling from west to east". The object which attracted my attention was at the time observing its course as the light invariably seems to descend their home and cattle with similar intervals.

Apparently these mystery lights strike terror into the hearts of animals. My informant states definitely that when the southern phenomenon appears in the distance, the horses and cattle become greatly excited, shaking and trembling and jibbing and moving over the plowing of the land. The lonely region at the head of the murumbidge river, in new south wales is spotted for these remarkable occasions. By eye-witness accounts", This light is singular in form, being like a ball of fire it most powerful glow is observed flickering about three feet off the ground and varying in intensity from a dim glow to a brilliant flash which subsided and lit up again in a most sensational manner. Whereas some claim the least effect, others have tried to approach it but, as though directed by some intelligent guide, it eludes them. The district was amazed to see this glowing, bird-like apparatus hovering over the Horne homestead for nearly 10 minutes, emitting a light so brilliant that it "lit up the property like mid-day".

He reckoned it was a time he second up. According to the account of the "coast fire" occasionally seen in the locality, they are small globes of light, semi-transparent, varying in size from 12 to 18 inches in diameter and one or two feet above the ground. They are quite silent and seemingly intelligent, moving around in a most purposeful manner, never remaining stationary for more than a few minutes, darting this way and that. We have not seen it ourselves but according to the reports of other reliable witnesses, the light actually was a fire emitting a kind of cold glow; side of a gallon drum. It has been mistaken for a burning log and actually resembled flames lapping up against the side of a dallen tree. It is observed at varying distances from the ground but never higher than 4 feet. Then the light ceased and no sign of human life. When the light reappears it invariably takes up the same position as before. It is not of the earth and the ground. While he says that he had himself heard reports of the "ghost fires" in the store explaining that these strange lights vary. Some believe that they are lights" while others claim that they make no noise whatever. Some declare they are sure-flying machines Some witnesses declare the color of descending was of a rapid flashing nature or belt-like pulsation.

Well, that's the article. I don't know if it has any particular relevance to any current questions, but there it is as I've transcribed it. Please let me know if you need anything else.
