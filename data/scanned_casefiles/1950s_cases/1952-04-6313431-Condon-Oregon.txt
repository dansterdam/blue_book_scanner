NARRATIVE:

At 1347 on the 22nd of April 1952, I, as standing in my yard at Condon, Oregon, I saw these unusual objects moving East, North of Condon. They were in formation and the large amber apparently in the lead. They were in ray-form on the underside and oddly metallic on all other surfaces. They were moving at a fast rate of speed and I saw them only for approximately two minutes. The larger was revolving. Yet it was so far away I could tell the direction.
