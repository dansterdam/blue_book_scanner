it had stripped the timing belt and had stopped time.
My Interpretation of what was seen:
1. According to the Air Almanac the moon rose just about the time of sighting.
2. A full moon or almost full moon looks coppery or even fiery when low to the horizon.
3. It was cloudy, almost a complete coverage. That made the nights very dark so the object was distinctly seen.
4. The appearance of the object to move was an optical illusion, due to the clouds moving down on the horizon and the moon shining through a small hole in the clouds.
5. The moon rose on the exact bearing where the object disappeared.
When I first saw the object I thought it was a flying saucer but after collecting my wits I can assure it was the moon I saw.

STATEMENT

At 2345 EDST 30 June 1953 I observed a thin glowing line in the sky to the North. This line appeared from the North to the Southeast and as it moved it began to grow larger in the vertical direction, but still maintaining its horizontal size. It had assumed an egg shape - point on top.

It was a strange color, had no dark spots, and looked like a luminous object trailing some sort of projection. As it moved to the East it appeared to be wobbling and gyrating wildly. The edges were smooth and it had a shimmering effect.

At the time the sky had broken clouds and it was rather windy.
The moon was not visible during this occurrence.

STATEMENT

At about 2345 hours on the 30th of June 1953 while on duty as 
Squadron Charge of Quarters my attention was called by personnel 
on duty at the Radar Site to view an unidentified object. I viewed
an elliptical object of a reddish orange nature hovering over the
horizon approximately north of the domestic site. Within a half hour I 
did not seem possible for the moon to travel that great a distance
in that short a time so what ever I viewed could not have been the
moon.

30 June 1953
UNCLASSIFIED
Ramore, Ontario, Canada
Description
At approximately 2345 EDST on 30 June 1953 an unidentified flying object was observed by several citizens at Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The object was sighted by the pilot and radar operator of the 93 Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The first person to observe this object was an airman who came out of the maintenance room to inspect the power unit which caused a minor breakdown of the search radar set-up. He observed two circular objects somewhat smaller than the moon hovering 40 to 50 feet above the ground. The airman called another airman and the two of them observed the object got hysterical and called the Charge of Quarters. At least seven witnesses observed the object at the Domestic Area now the object and two of them reported that the object was distinct and separate from another object which was oval shaped. It was described as moving from the north to southeast and then fading back to the north. No great speed was attributed to the object by any of the witnesses who said they saw movement. It was reported that the object had no visible means of propulsion and that there was no similarity to any known flying object.
Discussion
The sighting was made a few minutes after the scheduled time for the moon rise. The shape of the moon that night was similar to the description of the object; however, any explanation as that or the moon reflecting off the clouds is impossible. There is a probability that the object*was the moon reflecting off the clouds.
Conclusion
Possibly astronomical.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
REPORT NO. 53-2

The following is a more detailed report on a FLYOUT* transmittal by teletype
on July 24, 1953:

1. At about 2315 EDST on 20 June 1953 an unidentified object was seen in the
sky above Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The object appeared to be silvery-white in
color. It was circular in shape, about four or five feet in diameter. The object
was sighted by several persons in the vicinity. He called two witnesses over to
see the object. The object was hovering for about two minutes near the Ramore
airport, and then suddenly shot at high speed toward the northwest and disappeared
from sight. Two or three minutes later the object reappeared from the northwest,
hovered for a minute or two, and then again shot off at high speed and disappeared.
The whole sighting lasted for about twenty minutes.

2. The object was first sighted from the surface by visual means. No electronic or
radar pick-up was made. At the time the sighting occurred, there had been a minor
thunderstorm activity in the area which may have caused some disturbance to the
normal operation of the airport control system, but not to the extent of hindering
the inspection of the radar unit.

3. The witnesses were located about three and six miles east of the town of
Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The object was reported as coming out of the north, traveling
in a southeasterly direction and then disappearing to the north.

4. Of the witnesses two officers of the RCAF Corps, USAF one is a civilian.
Technical Sergeant C.L. Baker, USAF, stated that in his opinion the object was traveling
at an estimated speed of approximately 1200 to 1500 mph. Others present also estimated
the speed of the object as being exceptionally high. Although the observation by airmen
military training it could not be considered as a weather balloon or other known type
of aircraft. Although each witness had independent confirmation of the sighting, having
had experience during the afternoon of observing weather balloons or other aircraft.
Others of the group did not agree with this assessment and are of the opinion that the
object was some type of unconventional aircraft.

5. At the time of the sighting there was a broken overcast sky condition of
approximately 3000 to 5000 feet.

6. The sighting was made minutes after the scheduled time for the evening
visibility meteorological observation. The pilots of the object, if any, did not give
any indication of attempting to contact the airport control tower nor was there any
observation of the object being in communication either by radio or visual. The object
appeared both to the moon and the observation point throughout the sighting.

7. There is no physical evidence of the sighting.

8. No identification of the object nor identification action was taken. Search radar was not
operational at the time.

10. Interrogation revealed RDF-CAA stated that there was all traffic - and motor
vehicle traffic in the general area at the time. DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS

2 July 1953

AFFIDAVIT

At approximately 2315 EDST 30 June 1953 I was called from the telephone and shown by AIRMAN McDONALD to view an object in the sky. I saw an oval shaped orange colored object to the East - similar to an egg standing on end. It hovered about fifteen feet from the ground. It had a dark spot in the center and a door on the lower part. The object made no sound. It disappeared slowly upwards, and was last seen by me at tree top height. The object appeared to be solid.

The door on lower part - opened and a man with two heads stepped out and walked down to the ground. He seemed to be walking on steps but there was no visible steps. He had two looks - his head turned back and forth - his actions were same as human - but stood erect. He approached the object. Two other type men stayed behind in the object. The man had fair skin, carried no weapons or briefcases, appeared friendly. The man spoke English. I do not recall the conversation but I do recall his saying they came from beyond pluto. When speaking the man spoke from only one mouth. His appearance was normal except for the heads, and their clothing was similar to ours but the man wore shorts.

At the conclusion of his talk he returned to the object and it slowly disappeared to the East.

CERTIFICATE

At approximately 11:15 PM E.D.S.T., on Tuesday, 20 June 1953, I observed what appeared to be a multiple of disc-shaped objects in the sky. The objects appeared to be somewhat larger than the "full moon" and were definitely of an unconventional design. The object was hovering in the sky at a north-easterly direction and then disappeared from sight. The object was distinctly outlined and had definite forms.

There were one or other men present at the time and they will corroborate this observation.

CERTIFICATE

At about 1115 f.w., on Tuesday, 30 June 1953, in response to calls from some of my men, I sighted what I believed was a "flying saucer".

The object was elliptical in shape. There seemed to be a dull red glow surrounding the object which was between the object and myself. The object was in a horizontal plane, parallel to the earth's surface. The size of the object exceeded slightly the size of a coin held at arm's length.

As the object moved, it seemed to oscillate or flutter, but I could account for this illusion.

As the object travelled in a course that was seemingly due east, I continued to observe it for accuracy. It moved towards the south and then seemed to disappear quite suddenly.

STATEMENT

I was in bed reading, the time was 2350 on Tuesday 30 June 1953 when the telephone rang. A night switchboard operator on the other end was on the line.  He said "Mr. Balder, there is one of those flying things up here." Through the window I could see 7 lighted objects which were flying in a line. Just the tops of them were visible. I got the impression it was going VERY fast. I looked in the general direction of the hill, and I looked around but I could see nothing. To my amazement I saw a glowing disc about the size of a dish pan with a band or bright fiery light shining the center. The object seemed to be moving away from me. The sight seemed to be hypnotic and I had to decide to pick up the phone. To my dismay the object was no longer visible. I believed Mr. Balder had also observed the object, and I wait for his call. After some minutes Mr. Balder appeared around his trailer barefoot and in his pajamas. The object had disappeared. I questioned what I had seen. I felt that the trailer to see if Smith was still on the phone. He was there waiting for me to call the orderly room. I told him what had happened and he was off the phone. He said that the radar was off the air. I called Mr. Balder to the phone and went back outside. I stood there looking at the point the object had disappeared. There was a faint glow in the area where the object had disappeared. At 2359 the glow got brighter and I saw the object rising very rapidly to the north disappearing into the clouds. This made me feel that the object was intelligently controlled and that whatever it was, it was very fast. My wife handed me my shoes and said that she thought I had better get dressed and go to the orderly room. As soon as I arrived I called operations and found out that the radar was still off. Since I could not get any official reaction why the radar had gone off, I decided to go to the hill. As I drove I watched the point where I had last seen the object. After a short while the object came back through the clouds. The cloud cover did not affect it in the least. When it reached the top of the hill, I looked at it through binoculars and could see that the object sighted was the moon. When it reached the top of the hill I lost sight of it as it came through a hole in the clouds. The sky had almost a complete overcast but the object seemed to move between the clouds very rapidly. The sight alarmed me and made me think that whatever it was must have been under intelligent control. I found out from Mr. Smith that the generator had gone down and he had gone down to see what he could do. It was at this time he sighted the object. He had gone to the believe room to get Smith to ask for my operations. I had stopped because operations had stopped because of this incident.
