it had stripped the timing belt and had jumped time.

My Interpretation of what was seen:

1. According to the Air Almanac the moon rose just about the time of sighting.

2. A full moon or almost full moon looks coppery or even fivery when low to the horizon.

3. It was cloudy, almost a complete coverage. That made the night very dark, so to intensify the moon.

4. The appearance of the object to move was an optical illusion, due to the clouds moving down on horizon and the moon shining through a small hole in the clouds.

5. The moon rose on the exact bearing where the object disappeared.

When I first saw the object I thought it was a flying saucer but after collecting my wits I am sure it was the moon I saw.

STATEMENT

At 2352 EDST 30 June 1953 I was notified by the Charge of Quarters of an object in the sky. I looked and saw an orange colored object in the sky to the NNE. It was egg shaped and was on its side, fuzzy at edges. It had no spots, no doors, no windows and no visible means of propulsion. It was at an elevation of about 150. It dimmed away to the North. At the time there was no moon visible, but the object did not seem to resemble the moon rising. Its coloring was much more vivid.

STATEMENT

At 2345 EDST 30 June 1953 I observed a thin glowing line in the sky to the Northeast. The line moved from the North to the Southeast and as it moved it began to grow larger in the vertical direction, but still keeping its horizontal size, until it had assumed an egg shape - point on top. It was orange, colored, had no dark spots, no down, no windows, no sound, no tail, no visible means of propulsion and no evidence of people. Its outline was clearly defined and it hovered over the ground in this shape. It hovered to the Southeast and then headed North again and there seemed to slide into the clouds.

At the time the sky had broken clouds and it was rather windy. The moon was not visible during this occurrence.

AFFIDAVIT

On the night of June 30th 1953 I saw a huge disc, with a dull
reddish glow gliding on a horizontal plane to the East, there was
no tail to indicate it as a meteor, and I would estimate the size to
a Crosley Automobile.

S T A T E M E N T

At about 2345 hours on the 30th of June 1953 while on duty as Squadron Charge of Quarters my attention was called by personnel on duty at the Radar Site to view an unidentified object. I viewed an elliptical object of a reddish orange nature hovering over the horizon directly East of the domestic site. Within a half hour I viewed the moon South and a great distance from the horizon and it did not seem possible for the moon to travel that great a distance in that short a time so what ever I viewed could not have been the moon.

30 June 1953                     UNCLASSIFIED                     Ramore, Ontario, Canada

Description

At approximately 2345 EDST on 30 June 1953 an unidentified flying object was observed for a period of twenty minutes in the northern sky moving to the southeast by at least 10 personnel of the 912th ACW Squadron, Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The first person to observe this object was an Airman who came out of the maintenance room to inspect the power unit which caused a minor breakdown of the search radar set.

He called two other airmen to witness the object. One of the two thought the object was the moon. The airman who originally observed the object got hysterical and called the Charge of Quarters at the Domestic Area three miles to the northwest. At least seven witnesses at the Domestic Area saw the object and two of them reported that the moon was visible at the time and that the object was distinct and separate from the moon. The object was described as orange colored and oval shaped. It was described as moving from the north to southeast and then fading back to the north. No great speed was attributed to the object by any of the witnesses who said they saw movement. It was reported that the object had no visible means of propulsion and that there was no similarity to any known flying object.

Discussion

The sighting was made a few minutes after the scheduled time for the moon rise. The shape of the moon that night was similar to the description of the object, however, any explanation as that of the moon is in conflict with the reported observation of the two witnesses seeing both the moon and the object at the same time. There was a heavy broken overcast at the time of the sighting. There is a probability that the object was the moon reflecting off the clouds.

Conclusion

Possibly astronomical.

SUMMARY: (Enter summary of report. Give highlights in first one-sentence paragraph. List locations as lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part III)

The attached report is in reference to an unidentified object seen in the sky at about 2315 PDST 30 June 1953 at Ramore, Ontario. The object was described as oval in shape resembling an egg and by most of the viewers although one described it as a circular disc. The color was generally described as orange with no other identifying characteristics of doors, windows, means of propulsion etc. One witness did mention having persons on board. (See statement by Airman 2nd Lt. Almas Salo - a lone condition at the time and when others arrived at his location he was found to be in a state of shock and hysteria. No medical officer was available to adjudge his condition.

This is the second such sighting at this organization.

Later we had an even more fascinating "encounter". Two early from a radar station ops near the Canadian border. Two radar stations picked up an unidentified object which was summoned to set a great glowing UFO low in the trees a few miles away. The generator that powered the radar set went out of commission and the men were badly shaken up, but no one was hurt. The object was hovering but yet it started.

While he was in the hut, the saucer flew up to the radar shack and hailed, hovering in the air. A little later some men in a fire truck, 4 feet high, came walking down some inclined steps and out of the mountain around to the generator - he had two heads, one an old one and the other a young one. While younger seemed more or less agitated, the elderly head asked "May I please have a drink of water?" the elderly head asked.

The man summoned out that they had no water, which the unidentified investigation indicated he knew. The crew was apparently expecting some kind of invisible steps and re-entered the saucer, which flew back to its original position. Among the trees, a little over the radar station, it hovered for a moment and then disappeared. The witnesses were quite clear. The other witnesses, however, insisted that it was merely the aurora.

A formal report was filed on this and forwarded to ATIC. We were still puzzling over it when the next got a story from a pilot who had landed and interrogated the men. Behind the radar shack he had found traces of empty liquor bottles. "Please ignore original report" was the wire. "Disciplinary action has been taken."

The following is a more detailed report on a FLYOBSPT transmittal by teletype on July 1, 1953.

1. At about 2345 EDST on 30 June 1953 an unidentified object was seen in the sky by at Lamax near Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The first person to see the object was Airman Second Class Dean McDonald. He reported seeing the object appear in the sky and then moving to the Southeast. He called the Civilian Aircraft Control Center and was told that it was one of their aircraft. One of the Airmen then called the Charge of Quarters at the Domestic Area three miles to the Southwest. At least seven witnesses there saw the object and two of them also reported that the moon was visible at the time and that the object was definitely and separate from the moon. The object was described as orange colored and oval shaped. No great speed was attributed to it by any of the witnesses who said they saw movement from the North to Southeast and then fading back to the North. The object had no visible beam of propulsion and all but one person reported no windows, no people, nothing metallic, no sound and no similarity to any known flying object.

2. The object was first seen at about 2345 EDST 30 June 1953 and it was observed for approximately twenty minutes.

3. The object was observed from the surface by visual means. No electronic or radar data was made. At the time the search radar had a minor breakdown caused by a mechanical failure in the power generator. It was this failure that caused the initial observation by Airman McDonald who had come out of his maintenance room to inspect the power unit.

4. The observers were located about three and six miles east of the town of Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The object was reported as coming out of the North traveling to the Southeast - hovering in the East and then disappearing to the North.

5. Of the witnesses two Officers of the Dental Corps, USAF, one is a Hilltop Technician, one is a Sergeant, one is the First Sergeant, one is the Communications Section Supervisor and the other is an Airman named Smith. Although the observation by Airman Smith is quite unusual there is no positive evidence disproving the reliability of the group as a whole. Although several of the members of the group admitted to having had some beer during the afternoon or evening, others of the group did not have anything alcoholic to drink. Airman Smith was one of the group that admitted to having had some beer.

6. At the time of the sighting there was a broken overcast sky condition of the wind aloft was unknown.

7. The sighting was made minutes after the scheduled time for the moon-rise. The shape of the moon that night was similar to the description of the object, however any explanation of the sighting as that of the moon is in conflict with the reported movement from North to Southeast back to North.

8. There is no physical evidence of the sightings.

9. No interception nor identification action was taken. Search Radar was not operational at the time.

10. Information received from RCAF GCI station and sector ADCC showed no air traffic in the (general area at the time.

AFFIDAVIT

At approximately 2345 EDST 30 June 1953 I was called from the teletype room by Airman McDonald to view an object in the sky. I saw an oval shaped orange colored object to the East - similar to an egg standing on end. It hovered about fifteen feet from the ground. It had a dark spot in the center and a door on the lower part. Its edges were not clearly defined by were fuzzy. The edges appeared to be radiating.

The door on lower part - opened and a man with two heads stepped out and walked down to the ground. He seemed to be walking on steps cut through a visible, flat hard top. He was not alike - one looked young and other old - two arms and two legs about 4 foot tall. More of same type men stayed behind in the object. The man had fair skin, carried no weapons or breathing apparatus and did not appear unfriendly. The man spoke English. I do not recall the conversation but I do recall his saying they came from beyond Pluto. When speaking the man spoke from only one mouth. His appearance was normal except for the heads, and their clothing was similar to ours but the man wore shorts.

At the conclusion of his talk he returned to the object and it slowly disappeared to the East.

CERTIFICATE

At approximately 1115 PM E.D.S.T., on Tuesday, 30 June 1953, I observed what appeared an elliptical shaped object in the sky, the color a bright orange red. At first I thought it was the moon but glancing to the south the moon was plainly visible. The elliptical object was hovering in the sky in a north easterly direction and then disappear from sight. The object was distinctly outlined and had definite form.

There were other men present at the time and they will corroborate this observation.

C E R T I F I C A T E

At about 1145 PM, on Tuesday, 30 June 1953, in response to calls from some men, I witnessed what I believed was a "flying saucer".

The object was elliptical in shape. There seemed to be a dull reddish orange glow emanating from it. The movement, when I saw it, was in a horizontal plane, parallel to the earth's surface. The rate of speed ran indeterminates, but seemed slow. The distances, however, between the object and myself could account for this illusion.

The object traveled in a course that was seemingly due east. To check my observation for accuracy, I noticed the moon to the south at the same time the object was in the sky. As for ultimate course, that too was indeterminate, as the object seemed to disappear quite suddenly.

STATEMENT

I was in bed reading, the time was 2350 on Tuesday 30 June 1953 when the phone rang. Airman Smith was on the other end screaming, "Get the Balders, there is one of those flying things up here." I thought he was kidding so I kidded with him. Again Smith yelled, "Get the OD there is one of those flying things up here."

Inquired, half asleep, what direction the object was in. "Right by the hill," Smith said. I hopped out of bed, grabbed my pants and headed outside. I looked in the general direction of the hill, and to and behold there was something. To my amazement I saw a glowing disk about the size of a dish pan with a band of bright fiery light through the center. The object "seemed" to be moving away from me parallel to my line of sight. Since I had neglected to pick up my shoes, I did not think it was wise to run barefoot over to Mr. Balders trailer. I gave out with several loud cries. By the time Mr. Balder appeared around his trailer barefoot and in his pajamas, the object had disappeared. I explained what I had seen. I went back into the trailer to see if Smith was still on the phone. He was there yelling, "Sound an alert, push that button." Between the screams of Smith, Airman McDonald had told me that the radar was off the air. I called Mr. Balder to the phone and went back outside. I stood several minutes looking at the point where the object had disappeared. There was a faint glow at the same bearing where the object had disappeared. As I watched the glow get brighter and brighter, finally after several minutes I realized it was the moon. Mr. Balder came out and told me he was going to the orderly room. My wife handed me my shoes and shirt and I went to the orderly room. As soon as I arrived I called operations and found out that the radar was still off. Since I could not get any logical reason why the radar had gone off I decided to go to the hill. As I drove I watched the point where the object had disappeared. I had not gone but about quarter of a mile until I saw the moon break through the clouds. I then felt sure that the object sighted was the moon. Then I reached the top of the hill I looked at the sky which was lighted by almost a full moon as it came through a hole in the clouds. The sky had almost a complete overcast, quite slightly broken. The clouds were very, from the West to the East. McDonald was pulling on the PU-25A/U trying to get it started. I found out from him that the generator had quit and he could not see what he could do. It was at this time he sighted the object. He had gone to the teletype room to get Smith to ask for his opinion. I discovered later that the generator had stopped because
