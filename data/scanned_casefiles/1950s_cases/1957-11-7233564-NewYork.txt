The image appears to contain a photograph of a newspaper article or advertisement about a "Northern Lights Give Bright Colorful Show". The article discusses an unusual aurora display featuring weird-looking red glows that was observed on November 6th. There are no human faces present in this image.

Northern Lights Give Bright Colorful Show

On Wednesday night, November 6th, an unusual auroral display, featuring weird-looking red glows, further characterized by "changing fashion", having replaced their earlier appearance of "steady, even, colored bands" was observed. Notable in this respect authorities had taken as ground-breaking the "explanations" of Mantle, Whitney, and Arthur Eaton, Associates, for the San Fernando Valley Times, and some of the earlier explanations propounded in connection with similar sightings of the northern lights in the San Fernando Valley times.
