Here is the text from the document:

On Wednesday night, November 6th, an unusual auroral display, further confused the issue; and by Thursday the Air Force had gotten into an extra-terrestrial fashion, having replayed their all-purpose tape recording about no evidence of saucers, etc. This seems to have been taken as gospel by most papers. Although there were some paradoxically editorial skepticism concerning the "explanations". Notable in this respect was George Todd, editorial writer and columnist for the San Fernando Valley Times and Arthur Edson, Associated Press reporter in Washington.

Northern Lights Give
Bright, Colorful Show
Shimmering rays and fiery curtains of red, green and white blazed across the sky Monday night. Several localities Monday night observed the northern lights which normally are seen at high latitudes. The lights were observed in points as scattered as Boston, New York, Des Moines, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, N.M., Texas, Ohio, Van Nuys, Calif., and other points.

One paper citing the Bright View area called the Daily Herald. The auroral display had marked close or pale blue tones. Normally intense display had been somewhat less intense.
