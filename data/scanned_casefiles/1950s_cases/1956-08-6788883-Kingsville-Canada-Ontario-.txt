Most of the text on this page is illegible. The only clearly readable text is a handwritten note at the bottom right that says:

"Things! Forwarded - see S.R. below"

The rest of the document appears to be a faded or poorly scanned document with text that cannot be accurately read.

There are also some mathematical or notation markings and arrows, but the text is partially illegible or too faint to read completely with full confidence.

The document appears to be a hand-drawn diagram with notes related to a location or sighting near Detroit and Kingsville, Canada, with various annotations and a simple geometric sketch.
