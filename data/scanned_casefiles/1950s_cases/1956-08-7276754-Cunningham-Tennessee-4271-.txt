REPORTS OF OBSERVATIONS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
 
TENNESSEE  SIGHTING (1956)

8 AUGUST 1956 
Sighting in Burlison, Tennessee

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 8:20 PM on 7 August 1956, Mr. William Cunningham, Route 2, Burlison, Tennessee, observed a bright, egg-shaped object moving slowly through the sky. The object was apparently about 1500 feet in altitude and was visible for approximately 10 minutes. No sound was heard. The object changed course several times during the observation. Mr. Cunningham described the object as being about 50 feet in diameter and of a bright orangish-white color. No details of the object's structure could be discerned.

SIGNIFICANCE: This report is significant because of the close range of the observation, the slow speed and maneuvering of the object, and the reliable, credible nature of the witness. The description of the object and its reported behavior are consistent with observations of unidentified aerial phenomena reported in other cases.
