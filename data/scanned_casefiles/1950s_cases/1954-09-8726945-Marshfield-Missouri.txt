MARSHFIELD, MISSOURI

At about 11:00 AM on Sept. 22, 1954, myself, and Ash both being employees of Mobster Gas Company of Marshfield, Missouri were returning from Bracken, Missouri where we had completed a delivery. Approximately 3 miles east of Marshfield, Missouri on what is known as the Scout Camp Road, we observed far to the west three clouds, or forms of silver objects. They were far enough away or so small that they appeared as no more than a silver dot to our eyes, their were, as a rough guess about many thousands of these objects. I stopped the truck to watch these objects and after about 2 minutes my partner noticed another object at what we guessed to be 500 feet high and about 200 yards SW.

This object was somewhat like a boomerang in shape with the exception that one side or wing was very short and the other side or wing much longer. If the object was as close as we thought I would guess the entire width to be about 5 or 7 feet. This object was very thin in the wing section and the body as well. This object was silent. It appeared to be covered or made of some sort of plastic or very thin material. It revolved very slowly, the entire object revolved, not just the one wing. As it revolved and the wing came around near the sun it seemed to shine through or nearly through because of the change. It would seem to be much lighter in color when the sun was behind it.

The color was of a dark tan with 2 black stripes near the end of the wing or rotor. After we watched the object for a few minutes it started a climb without changing its flight characteristics or without gaining any RPM of its wing. After rising to what we thought to

be about 1500 feet it then started to come down much slower than it
had climbed as the climb took only about 20 seconds, after coming
down to what we thought about 500 feet it changed its revolving action
in that it started tumbling but not any faster than it had revolved.
After falling a short distance in this position it emitted a white
puff of white smoke or vapor, this was not in a trailing form but just
one bigg puff of smoke or vapor, at this time or any other time
did we ever hear any noise, after emitting this smoke or vapor it
stopped all motion and fell straight into a small patch of timber,
we did not actually see this object hit the ground because of the
rough terrain but we did see it go behind the timber line. We then
left our truck and went into the woods so see if we could find any
other trace of this object. A few some minutes we found two places
in the earth completely pulverized out did not show any sign of an
animal track, this might or might not of had any thing to do with it
but it did seem strange in such soft dirt that if an animal or human
had made it that it did not leave any track.

When we first noticed this object it seemed to hover at about the
600 feet level. The wing or rotor was slightly curved upward at the
tip and near the two dark stripes. When this object stopped its
rotating and started to fall the wing or rotor was pointed up indicating the base of this wing motion would be the body was the heaviest
part. At no time was there such speed involved in any fashion. While
falling it did not flutter or turn at all but fall straight down past
the timber line. Before falling past the timber line we watched this

Object for about 15 minutes. After the two of us were thoroughly we returned to Marshfield, Missouri and I called the Fordland Air Base and talked with GWO A. R. Justman about this object, he sent four men to Marshfield, Missouri where they picked the two of us up and we returned to the area and made a more through search and of a much wider area but without finding any more trace of this object that we had found before. At about 5:30 PM GWO A. R. Justman and myself returned to the area and made a third try at finding the object but still failed to find anything at all other than the two places in the earth that was torn up.

After leaving the truck in the beginning to start the first search Mr. Ash and myself did not see the silver object again that first attracted out attention. The two of us had time to study the object and it is just as I have described it.

DATE: 22 November 1954

At about 11:00 AM on Sept. 22, 1954, myself, and both being employees of Webster Gas Company of Marshfield, Missouri were returning from Bracken, Missouri where we had completed a delivery. Approximately 3 miles east of Marshfield, Missouri on what is known as the Scout Camp Road, we observed far to the west three clouds or formations of silver objects. They were far enough away or small that they appeared as no more than a silver dot to our eyes, there were, as a rough guess many thousands of these objects.

I stopped the truck to watch these objects and after about 2 minutes my partner noticed another object at what was guessed to be 500 feet high and about 200 yards SW. This object was somewhat like a boomerang in shape with the exception that one side or wing was very short and the other side or wing much longer. It was not well. This object was very thin in the wing section and the body as well. This object was very thin in the wing section and the body as well. This object was very silent. It appeared to be covered or made of some sort of plastic or very thin material. It revolved very slowly, the entire object revolving, not just the one wing. As it revolved and the wing came around near the sun it seemed to shine through or nearly through because of the changing in color, it would seem to be much lighter in color when the sun was behind it. The color was a dark tan with 2 black stripes near the end of the wing or rotor. After we watched the object for a few minutes it started to climb without changing its flight characteristics or without gaining any APN of its wings. After rising to what we thought to be about 1500 feet it then started to come down much slower than it had climbed. At about 20 seconds. After coming down to what we thought about 500 feet it changed its revolving action in that it started tumbling but not any faster than it had revolved. After falling a short distance it disappeared. This was not in a trailing form out just one big puff of smoke or vapor.

it this time or any other time did we ever hear any noise, after emitting this smoke or vapor it stopped all motion and fell straight into a small patch of timber, we did not actually see this object hit the ground because of the rough terrain but we did see it go behind the timber line. We then left our truck and went into the woods to see if we could find any other trace of this object. After some minutes we found two places in the earth completely pulverized but did not show any sign of an animal track, this might or might not had anything to do with it but it did seem strange in such soft dirt that if an animal or human had made it that it did not leave any track.

When we first noticed this object it seemed to hover at about the 600 foot level. The wing or rotor was slightly curved upward at the tip and near the two dark stripes. When this object stopped its rotating unit, it did fall in a very slow rotational point indicating the base of this wing which would be the body was the heaviest part. At no time was there much speed involved in any fashion. While falling it did not flutter or turn at all until nearly down past the timber line. Before falling past the timber line we watched this object for about 15 minutes. After the two of us searched the very thoroughly we returned to Marshfield, Missouri and I called the Foreland Air Base and talked with C/O A. R. Justman about this object, he sent four men to Marshfield, Missouri where they picked up and we returned to the area and made a more thorough search and of a much wider area but without finding any more trace of this object than we had found before. At about 6:00 PM, C/O A. R. Justman and myself returned to the area and tried a third try at finding this object but still failed to find anything at all other than the two places in the earth that was torn up.

After leaving the truck in the beginning to start this first search Mr. [REDACTED] and myself did not see the silver object again that first attracted our attention. The two of us had time to study the object and it is just as I have described.

                        UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

Object was sighted by Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] at 221700Z
Sept 54, at GEORGE FIFTH 0920 which was approximately three (3) miles east of
MARSHFIELD, MO. GEORGE FIFTH 0920. SOURCES were certain they had observed object
for 15 minutes. Condition of sky was bright with sun at SOURCES right when object
was observed. Object was tan in color in contrast with blue background of sky.
Object appeared to stand still then go up and come down with a pulsation, emitting
puffs of white smoke. It did not change shape, brightness, nor did it break up or
explode. Object did not move in front of anything at any time. Object appeared
solid and was observed through eyeglasses by Mr. [redacted] and with the naked eye
by Mr. [redacted]. No sound was heard from object. It was tan in color with two (2)
black stripes near end of protrusion (Refer to Sketch, Incl #1, Basic Correspond-
ence). Dimensions of object were approximately one-half of a grapefruit in size.
It was estimated that longest dimension of object was 5 feet (Refer to sketch,
Incl #1). Basic Correspondence size and shape). SOURCES were fairly certain
that object appeared to be the size of a grapefruit when held at arms length.
Object was last seen falling behind a timberlane. SOURCES were unable to associate
this object with any known object and therefore could not name any material it
could have been constructed of. However, Mr. [redacted] stated that he could make
a model of it with modeling clay. Object was first seen while riding in a truck
in the open countryside. Mr. [redacted] was driving the truck at 20 miles per hour
in a westerly direction when Mr. [redacted] noticed the object. The truck was stopped,
SOURCES detected and object was further observed. SOURCES were looking southwest
when object was first seen. When object was first seen it was 225 degrees from
true north and 45 degrees above the horizon. It was 190 degrees from true north
and 10 degrees above the horizon when it disappeared.

Weather conditions on date and time of sighting were hot and dry, clear sky
and a slight breeze. SOURCES stated that was the first time they had ever
seen an object like this. They had no idea what the object could have been or
what could have caused it. SOURCES were unable to estimate the speed of object,
They estimated their distance from object as 900 feet maximum and 450 feet minimum.

Mr. [redacted] is manager of the Webster Gas Co, Marshfield, Mo. He
resides at [redacted]. Phone: [redacted]. Mo., and is 23 years of age. He is
a high school graduate and attended an Armored School while in the Army.
Mr. [redacted] seemed to be very intelligent, sober and sincere. He was very
definite in his statements of what he had seen. He holds a private pilots license
and is quite familiar with aircraft. Mr. [redacted] stated he was also a model airplane
enthusiast. Investigator questioned Mr. [redacted] as to the possibility of object
having been a model airplane and received a negative reply.

Mr. [redacted] is a tank truck driver for the Webster Gas Co. in
Marshfield, Mo., where he resides. He is 21 years of age and a trade school
graduate. Mr. [redacted]

Approximately two (2) hours after the sighting occurred a fire was reported
in the city dump. This dump lay in the direct line of travel of the object when
last seen. Origin of fire was never determined nor any connection established
