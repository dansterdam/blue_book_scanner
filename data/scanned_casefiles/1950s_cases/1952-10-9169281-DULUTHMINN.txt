The image appears to contain a photograph of a cigar-shaped object. The text below the photograph discusses questions and answers about the object, including its shape, size, color, and movement. 

STATEMENT

Date: 24 October 1952

Question: What was the shape of the object?
Answer: It was cigar in shape, one corner had something like a weight that went up and down and it was quite close.

Question: What was the estimated size?
Answer: It was about 5 feet from corner to corner and from bottom to top it was about 2 feet. A distance was judged that it was in the vicinity.

Question: What was the color?
Answer: It was light tan or beige cream, more yellow.

Question: Did it have any markings?
Answer: I did not notice any markings although I first thought it could have been an advertisement of some kind. I did not see any.

Question: Did it make any sound?
Answer: It did not make any sound that I heard. I was inside the kitchen window wondering what to do for supper and I was dumbfounded when I saw it.

Question: What would be the estimated speed?
Answer: It went very slow lifting from the ground. I saw it up over the hill then I couldn't see it any more.

Question: Would you say it had been on the ground?
Answer: At first it was close to the ground and I told my son to see if he could catch it.

Question: But how high was it?
Answer: When it went over the hill it was about 20 or 30 feet in the air and went quite fast. I thought it might not be fast in the trees.

Question: What time was it when this happened?
Answer: It was about 5 or 10 minutes to four o'clock in the evening.

Question: How far was it from the town?

Signature of witness

The witness appears to be a 9-year-old child who witnessed a white, shiny object that went straight up into the air after being hit with a rock. The witness pursued the object for a few blocks before losing sight of it.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document discussing "Cruising Altitudes" and "Visual Flight Plans" related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

CRUISING ALTITUDES
CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES—Aircraft at or more than 3000 feet above the ground shall fly at specific cruising altitudes. The following rules will govern the altitude at which aircraft shall fly when making flights along civil airways: 
Green and Amber Airways:
Aircraft flying at or below 6000 feet. Shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 2000, 4000, or 6000 feet).
Aircraft flying at or above 7000 feet. Shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).

Northbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course from 270° to but not including 090°, shall fly at an even thousand-foot level above sea level.
Southbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course from 090° to but not including 270°, shall fly at an odd thousand-foot level above sea level.

CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES—When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude approved by the Air Route Traffic Control Center.

VISUAL FLIGHT PLANS
The Civil Air Patrol has announced that its members are not permitted to fly on VFR flights (that is, to fly under Visual Flight Rules) under certain conditions, and the CAA urges that VFR flights be covered by flight plan whenever practicable as much filing materially helps the search and rescue services. Information given in a flight plan may be communicated to the CAA services which can, when necessary, transmit it to airborne or ground stations or aircraft. Flight plans are available but this practice should be avoided whenever possible to reduce congestion of radio channels.

If filing a flight plan is not desired, the pilot should, before takeoff, or before leaving an airport, note the amount of C.A.A. radio station and the position from which he will close his flight plan. The arrival report will be filed must be clearly understood by all concerned. VFR flight plans are transmitted via CAA communication station unless otherwise instructed. In the event pilot decides not to file an arrival report the initial report will be considered the arrival report.

Photos of aircraft operating on VFR flight plan who desire to make flight progress reports, should include in the report the CALIPERS FA. TAIL NUMBER OF THE PLANE (Date to be furnished). In accordance with AR 95-52 MAINT FLIG-ET RULES, Flight Plans, except "Alternate Airport" and except that a visual flight rule flight plan should always specify "VFR" as a cruising altitude. The use of this term is of no actual altitude indication that the flight intends to be in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. Aircraft may be operating under Instrument Flight Rules.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

IDENTIFICATION OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IN LOCAL AREA:
Report of Unidentified Flying Object - Duluth, Minnesota, 23 September 1952
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 23 September 1952
LOCATION: Duluth, Minnesota
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 7:14 P.M.
DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 5 minutes

WITNESSES: Lt. Raymond Haugsrud, Duluth Police Dept., and Third Party, Identity Withheld.

SUMMARY: (1) Object was bright white and round or discoidal in shape. It appeared to be 30-40 feet in diameter and was estimated to be about 2000 feet above the ground. (2) Object was very brilliant and easily seen, and could be clearly discerned against the background. It gave off a bright, clear light which seemed to pulsate or fluctuate slightly. (3) Object was first observed moving rapidly from a northerly direction towards the southeast, slowing down and stopping momentarily, then continuing on its southerly course at a speed estimated at 500 miles per hour. While stationary, it hovered almost motionless. (4) Object was observed for a period of about 5 minutes before it disappeared completely from view.

VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS: No discernible structure or markings were observed. There were no wings, fins, or other external features. The object appeared to be a single, solid, discoidal craft.

OTHER INFORMATION: One G-3 landed in Duluth at 1558Z, other air traffic unknown.
