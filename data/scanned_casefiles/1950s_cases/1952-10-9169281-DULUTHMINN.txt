STATEMENT
By Mrs. [redacted] - taken 24 October 1952

Question: What was the shape of the object?
Answer: It was cubile in shape, one corner had something like a weight that went up and down and it was dark in color.

Question: What was the estimated size?
Answer: It was about 5 feet from corner to corner and from bottom to top, about 5 feet. I judged the size from the tones that was in the vicinity. It was quite close to the ground, almost touching the ground when I first saw it.

Question: What was the color?
Answer: It was light tan or beige cream, more yellow.

Question: Did it have any markings?
Answer: I did not notice any markings although I first thought it could have been an advertisement of some kind. I did not see any markings.

Question: Did it make any sound?
Answer: It did not make any sound that I heard. I was inside at the kitchen window wondering what to get for supper and I was dun-founded when I saw it.

Question: What would be the estimated speed?
Answer: It went very slow lifting from the ground. I saw it up over the hill then I couldn't see it any more.

Question: Would you say it had been on the ground?
Answer: At first it was close to the ground and I told my son to see if he could catch it.

Question: About how high was it?
Answer: When it went over the hill it was about 30 or 40 feet in the air and went quite fast. I thought it might get fast in the trees.

Question: What time was it when this happened?
Answer: It was about 5 or 10 minutes to four o'clock in the evening.

Question: How far was it from the tower? [last line partially obscured]

Exhibit H4 is noted in the top right corner of the document.

Page 2.

Answer : Looking out of kitchen window it was about 75 foot away almost. Touching the ground, perhaps 3 or 4 feet. I was thunderstruck. I couldn't imagine that it could be. It disappeared behind the end of the house and when I ran out to see where it was it was 3 or 4 feet in the air. I thought at the time caught in the trees but all of a sudden it went straight up into the air real fast about 5 or 7 feet.

Question: Did you notify anyone?

Answer : My husband notified the police and they wanted to know if I was all there. My husband notified the Duluth Herald and the party wanted to talk to me, I do not remember the name he gave me. I did give him the information that I have given you.

Question: What kind of material did you think it was?

Answer : It looked like plastic. It wasn't canvas or metal but it did look like plastic or rubber, looked hard and shiny.

Question: Can you think of anything else to tell us?

Answer : Can't think of anything else.

NOTE: Airport (Civilian) was called by son and the call was transferred to 1/75th and then to 3rd. son also called the Police and Herald. Clarifying question: "Did you notify anyone?"

Here is the text from the document:

CRUISING ALTITUDES

CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES—Aircraft at or more than 3000 feet above the surface within control areas and/or control zones must be flown at odd or even 1000-foot levels appropriate to the direction of flight. "Odd and even" indicators are shown on Coast and Geodetic Survey Radio Facility Charts.
The following rules will govern the altitude at which aircraft shall fly when making flights along civil airways:

Green and Red Airways
Eastbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course of from 0° (or 360°) to, but not including, 180° along a green or red civil airway shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).
Westbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course of from 180° to, but not including, 360° (or 0°) along a green or red civil airway shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 2000, 4000, or 6000 feet).

Amber and Blue Airways
Northbound flights. Aircraft making good a true course of from 270° to, but not including, 90° along an amber or blue civil airway shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).
Southbound flight. Aircraft making good a true course of from 90° to, but not including, 270° along an amber or blue civil airway shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot level above sea level (such as 2000, 4000, or 6000 feet).

CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES—When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as illustrated below.

[A circular diagram with aircraft silhouettes showing magnetic headings and corresponding altitudes]

VISUAL FLIGHT PLANS

The Civil Air Regulations do not require that a VFR flight plan be filed for a VFR flight. However, the filling of such a flight plan is desirable, and the CAA urges that VFR flights be covered by flight plan whenever practicable as such filing materially assists in search and rescue operations if such action becomes necessary. Flight plans may be submitted to the nearest CAA airway communications station either in person or by telephone. Flight plans may be filed by radio if no other means are available but this practice should be avoided whenever possible to reduce congestion of radio channels.
