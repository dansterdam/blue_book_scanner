Guam (Truk Island)                                                   6 February 1953

I. Description of Incident

At 1110 local time an Air Force Officer in charge of the Weather Bureau Station on Truk sighted an unidentified bull-shaped shiny object traveling an estimated 150 mph at an approximate altitude of 400 to 500 Ft. three to four miles away. The object appeared to be "slightly larger than a C-47 aircraft" with no noticeable wings or tail section and gave a shiny appearance as if of highly polished metal.

II. Discussion of Incident

A check with Guam flight service indicates that a C-47 was in the area at the time of sighting. The day was clear with a bright sun capable of distorting the normal features of a C-47.

III. Conclusion

Probably aircraft.
