2. This 2 yr old has very limited info. Cannot draw a valid conclusion.

Dear Sir:

Approximately on 22nd of May, I was traveling with my wife to the City of Nogales, Arizona. Around 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon when at the same time we saw that something came down from the sky like a meteor and landed about 10 miles from the side of the road. It was a brilliant white ball surrounded by flames. Like I said it was around 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon and was traveling in south to north direction perpendicular to earth. I am sending you this information so if it might be of any interest to your investigation and I'm ready to indicate the place where I saw this phenomenon.

Sincerely yours,
