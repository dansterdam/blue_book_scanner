Unidentified Flying Object

On 3 August 1957, at 11:52 while on a routine Airborne Operation Center mission (1st Lt. Robert J. Sprague, 7th Airlift Sq., TAC), 1st Lt. Sprague sighted an unidentified object on his scope at 177 only. The object appeared to be the same type of object as had been previously sighted. At 1156 the object became a blip/point. Two objects were observed continuously until 1152, as was the azimuth movement. At the time of commencing the turn, the object was 10 miles distant. It suddenly turned across the northward arc at high rate of speed ranging 1a 1500 or greater 50 miles. Object was resighted at 15182 and 22 miles. At 15202 it closed to a distance of 5 miles and was turned by parallel winds. The ADCAP aircraft. Contact was lost at 15242 at a distance of 15 miles. No visual contact was made at any time during the encounter.

This report is considered significant since it is the first time such a detection has been made as actually tracking. All previous detections have 177 points. A suggested explanation is given in inclosure #2.

1415 Have a "UFOB" on the scopes on IFF only, looks to be the same type object
1456 that has been seen many times before.
1500 Now have skippaint on the "UFOB".
1507 Hourly condition report.
1509 Turned the AFX-6447-K7 off and are still painting the "UFOB"
     very bright the weather at this time is layer of stf tops 3,000 ft. all above
     this clear, vis unlimited this is about 15Â° above the hors, at this time
     the "UFOB" is between us and the sun (unable to obtain height).
1515 The "UFOB" is at our 2 o'clock post, 10 miles - we started a right turn to re-
     verse course which put the target on our nose, at this time he turned N.W. at
     a very high rate of speed, contact lost at 58 miles.
1518 Regain contact at 1 o'clock 22 crossing right to left.
1520 Target now 10 o'clock crossing, he closed to 6 miles and then turn right so as to
     be flying a parallel head on 6 miles hors displacement.
1524 Contact lost at 7 o'clock 15 miles - During this time the pilot was unable to
     obtain a visual contact. This was done with spin path not IFF.

UNCLASSIFIED

This type of track has been picked up numerous times on Mode II IFF paint but this is the first report of actual skin paint. Before on the IFF paint it has been an Mode II IFF paint not coming in as a Mode II blip. The IFF paint was similar to a skin paint.

A suggested answer to this is that the object is some way generates a frequency the same as the Mode II frequency which would be picked up by the AYR VII Receiver and painted on the scope. This theory is borne out by the report that on previous pickups when the object remained more or less stationary the intensively or the paint weakened, as the object began to move the intensity increased.

From the information given and previous reports this does not fit any kind of logical explanation, therefore, this office is unable to give a definite answer. It does appear that this is possibly another case of anomalous propagation.
