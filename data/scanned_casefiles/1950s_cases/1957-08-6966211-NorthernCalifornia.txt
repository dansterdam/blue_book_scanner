1. ON 3 AUG 57, MR. THOMAS P. ANDERSON, USAF, OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA. MR.

HE DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN DIAMETER, CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, AND METALLIC IN APPEARANCE. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 500 TO 1000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. NO LIGHTS OR SOUNDS WERE OBSERVED FROM THE OBJECT. MR. ANDERSON FURTHER STATED THAT THE OBJECT MAINTAINED A STATIONARY POSITION FOR MOST OF THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
2. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN THE AREA ALSO REPORTED OBSERVATIONS OF THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. MRS. JANE DOE, A LOCAL RESIDENT, STATED THAT SHE OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES.

HOW FAST WAS IT TRAVELLING - TURNED THE AXY+AZY-7 OFF AS MASTER CONTROLS AND ARE STILL POINTING THE "HUSH" VERTICAL. DURING MANUVER SAW TO CALL FOR RADAR OPERATION 3,500 FT. ALTITUDE. THE "HUSH" IS BETWEEN US AND THE SUN (UNABLE TO OBTAIN HEIGHT). AT 1535 THIS CRAFT TURNED TO THE WEST AND ACCELERATED TO A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, CONTACT LOST AT 56 MILES.
SEVERAL OPERATORS OBSERVED THIS OBJECT.DURING THIS TIME THEY HAD A PARTIAL LOCK ON 4 MILES PER GO DISPLACEMENT. AND COULD TELL THE OPERATOR GAIN ON CONTROLS TO OBTAIN A VISUAL CONTACT. THIS WAS DONE WITH ADDED CAUTION NOT TO ALERT THE PILOT.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a "DISPOSITION FORM" document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.  
TO:  SUBJECT:  Evaluation of UFOB Report  (IR-822-57)
FROM:   AFOTN-HLS-2   DATE:  16 Aug 1957
COMMENT NO.1
From the information given and previous reports, this does not fit any kind of hostile propagation; therefore, this action is unable to give a definite answer. It does appear that this is possibly another case of anomolous propagation.
