6. SOURCE
Control Tower Op.

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
two hours

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
NE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One object shape flat plane, oval, size of nickel, color blue center, green ring or orbit with red flashing light in center. Object appeared to be two saucers placed face to face. Object stationary about 8 minutes then was rapidly dimmed out.

11. COMMENTS
The fact that the object did not apparently move for 2 hours, or observed through binoculars (which magnified image) and ATIC's check that bright star ARCTURUS was in the position rptd, strongly indicates that it was a star. Rpt also states that the sky was broken cloud covered. Therefore the movement of the clouds between the objs and star would give it an appearance of flashing & odd colors

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Possibly Balloon
Was Aircraft
