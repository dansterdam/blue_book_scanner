11. COMMENTS
This is to the duration of the sighting and the color of the object. It is not certain whether the exact altitude or exact distance of this object is known. It is possible it was generated by a balloon as the time of the end of the sighting indicated it is doubtful the object was detected on radar. If 2233 was the time of the end of the sighting, it is possible the balloon had been released at Beloit at 12:00 and traveled for several hours.

No report in file.
