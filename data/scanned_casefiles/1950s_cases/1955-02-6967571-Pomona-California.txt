...IS SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST A PASSING INCIDENT - IT APPEARS TO BE AN INTENTIONAL ON THE PART OF SOME AGENCY TO PREVENT THIS INFORMATION FROM BECOMING PUBLIC. I DO SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND THAT I WILL RECEIVE A REPLY TO THIS REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION. IT IS MY HONEST AND CONSCIENTIOUS BELIEF THAT I HAVE NOT ONLY A RIGHT, BUT AN OBLIGATION TO BRING THIS MATTER TO YOUR ATTENTION.
