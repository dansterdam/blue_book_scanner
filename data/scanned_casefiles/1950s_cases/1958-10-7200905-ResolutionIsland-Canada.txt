STATEMENT

Approximately 0015 hours 2 17 October 1958, a light was noticed about 50 miles S-SW from the back of Pole Vault I. Light seemed to be a yellow orange (bright) and half moon in shape and approximately 5000 feet high. Observed object from Pole Vault I, back door for about 1 minute and then went over to Pole Vault II back door and this object was partially obscured from view by antenna. Object was viewed for about another minute & then object disappeared. Object seemed to be moving in a vertical path (down). The night was clear, no stars in that section of the sky. Moon and stars were in S.S.E vicinity.
