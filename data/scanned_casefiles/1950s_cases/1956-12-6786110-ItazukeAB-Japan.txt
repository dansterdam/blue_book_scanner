DECEMBER 1956 FAR EAST                                                (KEYHOE-1960 P 104) 1 WITNESS   00

ON ******** DECEMBER TWO USAF JET PILOTS WERE PRACTICING GROUND RADAR           01
POSITIONED INTERCEPTS ON EACH OTHER IN THE VICINITY OF ********                 02

DURING ONE RUN, THE INTERCEPTING PILOT PICKED UP A STRANGE RADAR BLIP FROM      03
AN UNKNOWN OBJECT IN THE SKY. FROM THE BLIP-S SIZE -- ONE-EIGHTH OF AN INCH     04
HIGH AND THREE-EIGHTHS OF AN INCH WIDE -- THE UFO WAS ESTIMATED AT LEAST AS      05
LARGE AS A B-29 FOUR-ENGINE BOMBER. RADAR SHOWED IT TO BE TWENTY MILES AWAY.     06
30 DEGREES TO THE PILOT-S LEFT.                                                 07

PILOT CALLED THE GCI (GROUND CONTROL, INTERCEPT) SITE ...... RECEIVED            08

PERMISSION TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE SOURCE OF THE RADAR RETURN.            09
AS HE HEADED TOWARD THE UFO, THE JET-S INSTRUMENTS SHOWED HE WAS CLOSING AT      10
A SPEED OF SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED KNOTS. (APPROXIMATELY 720 TO 840 MPH.) AT        11
EIGHT MILES, A ROUND OBJECT APPEARED EXACTLY WHERE RADAR SHOWED IT. LATER        12
CALCULATIONS INDICATED IT WAS AT LEAST 200 FEET IN DIAMETER, PROBABLY NEARER     13
350.                                                                             14

BY THIS TIME, THE JET-S RADAR HAD LOCKED ONTO THE UFO AND WAS                    15
AUTOMATICALLY GUIDING THE PLANE TOWARD THE OBJECT. SUDDENLY THE RADAR WAS        16
JAMMED BY A STRONG INTERFERENCE... USING ANTI-JAM PROCEDURE, THE PILOT           17
SWITCHED FREQUENCY. FOR TEN SECONDS THIS ELIMINATED THE MYSTERIOUS                18
INTERFERENCE PULSES, THEN THEY BEGAN AGAIN, BUT THE PULSATIONS WERE NOT          19
STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE RADAR LOCK-ON AND JET HELD TO ITS COURSE.             20
THE JET CLOSED TO WITHIN FIVE NAUTICAL MILES OF THE OBJECT AND COULD NOT         21
CLOSE FURTHER. WHEN THE PILOT WAS CLOSEST TO THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT, IT         22
APPEARED TO MAKE A SHALLOW LEFT TURN. IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING CIRCULAR    23
ON THE BOTTOM.                                                                   24

AFTER THIS, THE UFO SPEEDED UP SO SWIFTLY THAT THE JET-S RADAR COULD NOT         25
GET AN ACCURATE READING.                                                         26

THE OBJECT WAS MOVING UP AND AWAY FROM 1,500 TO 1,800 KNOTS. (1,800 TO           27
2,160 MPH.)                                                                      28

IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PILOT REPORTED THE UFO AND LANDED, HIS JET WAS TESTED      29
BY ANOTHER AIR FORCE PILOT. ALL EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING RADAR, OPERATED             30
CORRECTLY. THE AIRCRAFT WAS THEN CHECKED BY GROUND PERSONNEL. AGAIN, ALL         31
ITEMS WERE SATISFACTORY.                                                         32

WASHINGTON, OCT. 5--(UP)--NON-OFFICIAL FLYING SAUCER INVESTIGATORS
REPORT THAT AN AIR FORCE JET CHASED A BIG AND SPEEDY CIRCULAR FLYING
OBJECT IN THE FAR EAST DECEMBER.
THEY SAID THE JET GOT WITHIN FIVE MILES OF THE OBJECT BEFORE IT
FLEW OFF AT A SPEED BETWEEN 1,800 AND 2,150 MILES AN HOUR.
THE REPORT WAS MADE BY THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE OF AERIAL
PHENOMENA, A PRIVATELY-FINANCED RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, IN ITS MONTHLY
MAGAZINE, "UFO INVESTIGATOR."
THE AIR FORCE HAD NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT.
THE NICAP SAID A "FAR EAST AIR FORCE OFFICE" HAD ADVISED THAT AN
UNIDENTIFIED JET PILOT PICKED UP THE AUTO (UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT)
AS A STAR SCREEN BLIP, ON ITS RADAR SCREEN, AND STARTED PURSUIT MORE
THAN 300 MILES AN HOUR.
AT LIGHT MILES RANGE, IT QUOTED THE FAR EAST REPORT, "A LARGE
ROUND OBJECT APPEARED DIRECTLY AHEAD."
"BY THIS TIME, THE JET'S RADAR WAS IN 'LOCK ON' POSITION, 
AUTOMATICALLY GUIDING THE JET TOWARD THE UFO." A MOMENT LATER, THE
RADAR WAS JAMMED BY A STRONG, INTERFERENCE USING ANTI-JAM PROCEDURE.
THE PILOT SWITCHED FREQUENCY FOR 10 SECONDS. THIS ELIMINATED THE
MYSTERIOUS INTERFERENCE PULSES, THEN THEY CAME AGAIN ON THE NEXT PERIOD.
BUT THEY WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE RADAR LOCK ON THE JET.

In accordance with existing policies for the study and analysis of UFO reports, request that the attached official UFO report submitted by the Far East Air Forces be reviewed for a possible explanation from the electronic and related view.

While not intended to influence your particular phase of the evaluation, a preliminary analysis by this office, based on the information given, is outlined below for consideration:

1. Two aircraft. First aircraft reports both radar and visual sighting. Second aircraft (wing man) made no contact, visual or radar.

2. Object described as tan in color and round on top. It should be emphasized that the general construction of all weather balloons (pibal, rawin, rabal, radiosonde) are of rubberized latex and tan in color.

3. The general area of observation (34-00 N, 131-00 E) is between southeast Korea and slightly east of the Japanese Island of Tsushima.

4. The general wind direction was from the west-northwest at the altitude of observation.

5. AF Weather units which launch both scheduled and unscheduled balloons are located at Pusan, Chinhae and Taegu in Korea. These units are located northwest of the UFO sighting. A weather unit was located almost directly under the location of the sighting, Tsushima Island.

6. Experience from numerous balloon cases show that under certain conditions, only the top portion of a balloon may be visible, particularly when observed from above, as in this case.

7. On the basis of the above, and other related information supplied by the 4th Weather Group, it is the opinion of this office, at this phase of the evaluation, that the pilot came across a regularly launched or "runway" balloon. With regard to the latter, the origin could be Communist China.

8. Reference item 2E of attached report stating ship moved rapidly to top of scope upon close approach of the aircraft. Could this have been caused by a balloon draft or apparent to rise suddenly when orbiting? Reference item 3. Although aircraft was under GCI observation at all times, the UFO was not observed by the ground unit.

1. The following comments are made with reference to the radar portion of this UFO sighting:

   a. The size of the "blip" on the scope is much larger than a normal return for a single target.

   b. Assuming a large target (from the large "blip" observed), the wing man and the GCI station should also have had radar contact. This they did not.

   c. The speed the target left the scope eliminates returns from aircraft, including the B-57.

2. It is extremely difficult to discount sightings which involve both visual and radar sightings. In this case the existence of a physical target cannot be positively disproven, although the discrepancies in the radar portion of the sighting indicate that at least the radar sighting is a false target. It is true, the sighting may be a case of associating an actual visual target with a false radar target.

3. Although this office is not in a position to comment on the subject, it would seem that unusual weather or transmission conditions which affect radar transmissions might also affect visual transmissions thereby providing freak visual observations.

JET CHASE OF LARGE CIRCULAR
OBJECT INVESTIGATED
BY FAR EAST AIR FORCE

For eight months the Far East Air Force has been in possession of an Intelligence Report describing the jet chase of a strange round object larger than a B-29 bomber. According to this report, the UFO accelerated to a speed of about 2000 miles per hour when the jet tried to close in.

Intelligence Report Details Released to NICAP

Full details of the chase were revealed to NICAP on August 29 in an unclassified section of the Intelligence Report. This is the first detailed report of a jet-UFO chase released anywhere in the Air Force since 1953. Whether release of this important case indicates a change in Air Force policy or is an isolated incident, is yet to be determined.

The Air Force report sent to NICAP from a Far East Air Force office bears the following heading:

"On — December 1956" the Air Force report begins, "two USAF jet pilots were practicing ground radar positioned intercepts on each other in the vicinity of ___________. During one run, the report says, the intercepting pilot picked up a strange radar blip from an unknown object in the sky. From the size of the blip—one-eighth inch high and three-eighths of an inch wide—the UFO was estimated as large as a B-29 four-engine bomber. Radar showed it to be 20 miles away and 30 degrees to the pilot's left."

Pilot called the GCI site to ask if they had a target which would correspond to the unidentified blip. After receiving an (Please turn to Column 1, Page 2)

Air Force Tells Congressman it
Has Given NICAP "All UFO
Information" Despite Written Refusal

Despite an official refusal on July 18 to release UFO cases to NICAP, the Air Force now publicly insists that it has given NICAP "all information in the hands of the United States Air Force."

This contradictory statement, sent on September 12 to Rep. Frelinghuysen, Jr., (R, N. J.) was signed by Maj. Gen. Joe W. Kelly, USAF, Director of Legislative Liaison.

On September 11 the same Air Force statement was sent to Vice Admiral John M. Hoskins, USN, Ret., now Director of Declassification Policy, Department of Defense. Admiral Hoskins had asked the Air Force for-facts on NICAP and the release of UFO reports.

The identical statement sent to Admiral Hoskins and Rep. Frelinghuysen follows: "The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena is not a governmental

Part I - Weather Balloons

1. In the analysis of Flyobryts prior to 1 Jul 52 approximately 15% were classified as "possibly" or "probably" balloon. The basis for decision was generally little more than a form of guesswork if the Flyobryt did not do anything, and mean less than "allowed for obviously a military, that a balloon could not do in maneuvers, speed, etc., and if the description corresponded even roughly to that of a balloon, it was so classified.

If there was no particular reason to believe a balloon was in the area, the report became a "possible". If the sighting occurred near a balloon launch site or on or about the launch time, it became a "probable". It was obvious that an effort to obtain factual data to support such conclusions was in order.

2. ATIC-5 approached the problem of weather balloons first. Weather balloons are of the following types:

a. Radiosonde - Rubberized tan latex, 6' in diameter at launch, up to 20' at altitude. Carries a transmitter and telemetering device for temperature pressure, dewpoint sequences. Also carries a white running light during night launches, battery operated, which should last for duration of flight. Normal ascent is 70,000' - 100,000', at 1,000 ft/min, at which altitude the balloon bursts and equipment recovery is effected by a red parachute.

b. Rawin - Same balloon as above, but it carries only a radar "triangle", and is a winds aloft observation.

c. Rawinsondes - Same, a combination of rawin and radiosonde.

d. Rabal - Same type of balloon, tracked by theodolite for winds aloft observation.

e. Pibal - A rubberized (tan) latex balloon, 30" in diameter at release and 6' or 51 at altitude. Burst and climb comparable to radiosonde. A winds aloft observation, tracked by theodolite. Carries running light for night launches.

All types of balloons are launched at 0300Z, 0900Z, 1500Z and 2100Z daily. However, some stations launch one, two, three, or four times/daily. Others launch irregularly, some launch only one type, and others several or all. In addition, time of launch may vary approximately thirty minutes from the scheduled time, either way. All agencies which launch balloons are quick to admit that balloons can and do drift in lots. In addition, wind currents at altitude can cause the balloons to assume odd shapes and strange maneuvers. The balloons under certain atmospheric conditions can appear to be almost any color, and may be visible at extreme altitudes, particularly at sunrise and sunset, to an observer on the ground.

JET CHASE from Page 1

answer in the negative, he asked for and received permission to determine the nature of the source of the radar return.

As he headed toward the UFO, the jet's radar showed he was closing in at a speed of six to seven hundred knots. (Approximately 720 to 840 miles per hour.)

At eight miles range a round object appeared in the sky, exactly where the radar showed it. To show up as more than a speck at that distance, the UFO had to be fairly large. The pilot described it as "the size of a lead pencil eraser if placed against the windscreen."

(NICAP comment: From figures supplied by North American Aviation, builders of the F-86-D Sabrejet, and the Civil Aeronautics Administration, the UFO appears to have been about 350 feet in diameter. See detailed explanation later in this account.)

By this time, the Air Force report continues, the jet's radar was in "lock on" position. That is, it had locked onto the UFO and was automatically guiding the jet toward it.

Jet's Radar is Jammed

As the plane came closer, its radar was suddenly jammed by a strong interference. Using anti-jam procedure, the pilot switched frequency. For ten seconds, this eliminated the mysterious interference pulses, then they began again. But the pulsations were not strong enough to break the radar lock-on, and the jet held to its course.

"The jet closed to within five nautical miles of the object and could not close further," the Air Force report states.

"When the pilot was closest to the unidentified object," it appeared to make a shallow left turn. It had the appearance of being circular on the bottom."

The color of the object was described as a golden tan, with no reflection from the sun. After the UFO's tight turn, the pilot's radar indicated that the object was "moving up and away at from 1500 to 1800 knots." (Approximately 1800 to 2160 mph) The Air Force report adds that this was an estimate, since the UFO's rate of departure was faster than the jet's radar could indicate. The blip, it said, "also appeared by moving rapidly off the top of the scope."

The Air Force investigation indicates the seriousness with which the UFO sighting was regarded. Immediately after the pilot landed and made his report, the jet was tested by another AF pilot.

All equipment, including the radar, operated correctly. The aircraft then was thoroughly checked by ground personnel; again, all systems were satisfactory, according to the Intelligence report.

The final section of the report goes a long way toward dispelling the idea that the Air Force actually brushes off UFO sightings. Entitled, "Comments of the Interrogation Officer," this section follows:

"Operation, maintenance and intelligence personnel of the — Squadron, Wing and — Air Division were of great assistance in the UFO investigation. (Ed. Under AFR 200-2 the term UFOB is used instead of UFO.)

"Written statements from the above organizations verifying information in this report are on file in the DI — Office.

"The observing pilot, Lt. —, had many flying hours of the time of the incident. Over half had been logged in this type of jet. He appeared to be conscientious and reported the incident in a straight forward, slightly embarrassed manner, saying that he would doubt the possibility of such an occurrence if it hadn't actually happened to him.

"The fact that no unidentified tracks were observed by ground radar should not be given much weight in evaluating this report. Both the jet aircraft involved required IFF in order that the controlling GCI site could plot them." (Ed: IFF is the name of an identification code transmitter system developed in World War 2 called "Identification, Friend or Foe." The fact that IFF signals were required for GCI to plot the jets indicates that the Air Force planes did not show up normally on ground radar.)

NICAP Explanation: At the moment when the pilot made his relative estimate of the UFO's size, using the pencil eraser comparison, the object was directly ahead at the jet's altitude.

The size of the object would depend on the distance from the pilot's eyes to the windscreen, dead ahead. According to North American Aviation, makers of the F-86-D Sabrejet, this distance for the Sabrejet is 2.27 feet, and the average for most jets is not much over 2.50 feet.

The average pencil eraser is one-fourth of an inch in diameter. According to figures confirmed by the Civil Aeronautics Administration, if the pilot's eyes were 2.50 feet from the windscreen the object was 352 feet in diameter. At three feet the diameter would be 293 feet. Even allowing for an appreciable error in estimating the object's apparent size, it seems plain that the UFO must have been at least 200 feet in diameter, and probably much larger.

The significance of this Air Force report is obvious. It is clear that armed forces pilots are still encountering unexplained UFOs—solid, round shaped objects—seemingly under intelligent control—though to date official intelligence still says there is no evidence of the UFOs' existence.
