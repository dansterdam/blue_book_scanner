It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with text describing an incident involving two USAF jet pilots practicing ground radar interceptions and encountering a strange radar blip that was estimated to be at least 20 miles away. The text provides detailed descriptions of the incident, including how the pilots' instruments showed the object was closing in on them, the various radar readings and calculations made, and the pilots' subsequent actions in attempting to track and identify the object.

DECEMBER 1956 FAR EAST
ON DECEMBER 6, 1956, TWO USAF JET PILOTS WERE PRACTICING GROUND RADAR 
POSITIONED INTERCEPTS ON EACH OTHER IN THE VICINITY OF A GROUND CONTROL 
INTERCEPT SITE. 
DURING ONE RUN, THE INTERCEPTING PILOT PICKED UP A STRANGE RADAR BLIP FROM
AN UNKNOWN OBJECT IN THE SKY. FROM THE BLIPS SIZE, ONE-EIGHTH OF AN INCH ON HIGH AND THREE-EIGHTHS OF AN INCH WIDE - THE UFO WAS ESTIMATED AT LEAST AS
LARGE AS A B-29 FOUR-ENGINE BOMBER. RADAR SHOWED IT TO BE TWENTY MILES AWAY, 
30 DEGREES TO THE PILOT'S LEFT.
PILOT CALLED THE GCI (GROUND CONTROL INTERCEPT) SITE ......... RECEIVED
PERMISSION TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE SOURCE OF THE RADAR RETURN.
AS HE HEADED TOWARD THE UFO, THE JET'S INSTRUMENTS SHOWED HE WAS CLOSING AT
A SPEED OF SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED KNOTS (APPROXIMATELY 720 TO 840 MPH). SUDDENLY
A ROUND OBJECT APPEARED EXACTLY WHERE RADAR SHOWED IT. LATER 
CALCULATIONS INDICATED IT WAS AT LEAST 200 FEET IN DIAMETER, PROBABLY NEARER 350.
BY THIS TIME, THE JET'S RADAR HAD LOCKED ONTO THE UFO AND WAS 
AUTOMATICALLY GUIDING THE PLANE TOWARD THE OBJECT. SUDDENLY THE RADAR WAS
JAMMED BY A STRONG INTERFERENCE. USING ANTI-JAM PROCEDURE, THE PILOT 
SWITCHED FREQUENCY. FOR TEN SECONDS THIS ELIMINATED THE MYSTERIOUS
INTERFERENCE PULSES, THEN THEY BEGAN AGAIN. BUT THE PULSATIONS WERE NOT 
STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE RADAR LOCK-ON. THE JET HELD TO ITS COURSE.
THE JET CLOSED TO WITHIN FIVE NAUTICAL MILES OF THE OBJECT AND COULD NOT 
CLOSE FURTHER. WHEN THE PILOT WAS CLOSEST TO THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT, IT
APPEARED TO MAKE A SHALLOW LEFT TURN. IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING CIRCULAR.
AFTER THIS, THE UFO SPEEDED UP SO SWIFTLY THAT THE JET'S RADAR COULD NOT
GET AN ACCURATE READING.
THE OBJECT WAS MOVING UP AND AWAY FROM 1,500 TO 1,800 KNOTS. (1,800 TO 2,160 MPH).
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PILOT REPORTED THE UFO AND LANDED, HIS JET WAS TESTED
BY ANOTHER AIR FORCE PILOT. ALL EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING RADAR, OPERATED 
CORRECTLY. THE AIRCRAFT WAS THEN CHECKED BY GROUND PERSONNEL. AGAIN, ALL
ITEMS WERE SATISFACTORY.

AUTOMATICALLY GUIDING THE JET TOWARD THE UFO, A MOMENT LATER, THE RADAR WAS JAMMED BY AN INTERFERING ANGLES. AFTER THIS PROCEDURE, THE PILOT SWITCHED FREQUENCY. FOR 15 SECONDS THIS ELIMINATED THE MYSTERIOUSLY PULSES, THEY CAME AGAIN ON THE NEW FREQUENCY BUT THEY WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE RADAR LOCK-ON AND HELD IT FOR OCCASIONAL STRONG PULSES AGAIN OUT OF RANGE. MORE SLOWLY.

Radar and Visual UFO Reported by USAF
AFOIN-4A
20 Dec 56
AFOIN-4X2b

In accordance with existing policies for the study and analysis of UFO reports, subject report is submitted for a possible explanation. This report was obtained from the Far East Air Force and related visual sightings.

This information is intended to influence your particular phase of the evaluation. Preliminary analysis by this office, based on the information given, is outlined below:

Two aircraft - First aircraft reported both radar and visual sighting. Second aircraft (wing man) made no contact, visual or radar.

The general area of observation (34-00 N, 131-00 E) is between south-east Korea and slightly east of the Japanese Islands.

The general wind direction was from the west-northwest at the altitude of observation.

The weather on the night of the incident with launch both scheduled and unscheduled balloons at Pusan, Chinhai and Taegu in Korea. These units are located northwest directly under the location of the UFO sighting, Tsushima Island.

Experience from unscheduled balloon cases show that under certain conditions, only stop particles may be visible, particularly when observed at long range. On the basis of the above, and other related information supplied by this office, it is the opinion of this office, at this phase of the evaluation, that the observed phenomenon was probably a scheduled or unscheduled balloon. WITH REGARD TO

Reference item 2a of attached report stating blip moved rapidly to top of scope upon close approach of the aircraft. Could this have been caused by a malfunction of the radar and/or aircraft antenna affected by the UTO? Though the report was under continuous observation at all times, the UTO/unidentified visual sighting could not be tracked or identified.

SUBJECT: Radar and Visual UFO Reported by ADIN-L-BL
FROM: ADIN-L-BL
DATE: APOIN-L-BL/V. D. BRYANT/jc
TEL31/disc 365-D/fm S

1. The following comments are made with reference to the radar portion of this UFO sighting:
a. The size of the "blip" on the scope is much larger than a normal return for a single target.
b. The indications are that this was a large target (from the large "blip" observed), the GCI station should also have had radar contact. This they did not have.
c. The speed the target left the scope eliminates returns from aircraft, including the B-47.
2. It is extremely difficult to discount sightings which involve both visual and radar tracking. In case the evidence of a physical target cannot be positively disproven, although the discrepancies in the radar portion of the sighting denies this the radar sighting is a full target. If this is true, the sighting may be a case of associating an actual visual target with a false radar target.
3. Although this office is not in a position to comment on the subject, it would seem that unusual weather or transmission conditions which affect radar transmissions might also affect visual transmissions thereby providing freak visual observations.

- Published by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena -
Vol.1, No.2 Washington, D.C. August-September, 1957
JET CHASE OF LARGE CIRCULAR OBJECT INVESTIGATED BY EAST AIR FORCE
For eight months the Far East Air Force has been in possession of an Intelligence Report describing the jet chase of a strange round object larger than a B-29 bomber. According to this report, the UFO accelerated to a speed of about 2000 miles per hour when the jet tried to close in.
Intelligence Report Details Released to NICAP --
Full details of the chase were revealed to NICAP on August 27. In an uncensored version released nowhere in the Air Force since 1953. Whether or not release of this important case indicates a change in Air Force policy or is an isolated incident, is yet to be determined.
The report of the jet chase sent to NICAP from a Far East Air Force office bears the following heading:

Debriefing
"On December 1956" the Air Force report begins, "two USAF jet pilots were pursuing an unidentified object in the sky. The UFO was estimated in size to be about one-eighth inch high and three-eighths inch thick at arm's length.
"Pilot called the GCI site to ask if they had a target which would correspond to the unidentified blip. After receiving an affirmative, the pilots continued to chase the UFO."
(Please turn to Column 1, Page 2)

Air Force Tells Congressman It Has Given NICAP "All UFO Information" Despite Written Refusal
Despite an official refusal on July 16 to release any information on UFOs to NICAP, the Air Force gave NICAP all the same information in September. This contradiction was admittd by the Department of the United States Air Force.
This contradiction in statement was noted, and an on-the-record conversation with the Air Force on question of UFO reports. Maj. Gen. John A. Samford, Lt. USAF Ret., Director NICAP, follows:
The identical statement sent to Admiral Hillenkoetter and the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena: "The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena is not a governmental agency."

The image does not contain any photographs, only text describing various types of weather balloons. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Part I - Weather Balloons

1. In the analysis of flyoops prior to 1 Jul 52 approximately 15% were classified as "possibly" or "probably" balloons. The basis for decision was that visual observations were all characterized as consistent with the reported balloon performance capabilities, that the balloons could not do in maneuvers, speed, etc., and if the descriptions corresponded even roughly to the behavior of a balloon, it was so classified. If there was no particular reason to believe a balloon was in the area, the report was listed as "unidentified". In a few cases it became a "probable". It was obvious that an effort was made to attempt such conclusions, but in many cases there was not enough detailed information to justify such a conclusion.

2. ATIA-5 approached the problem of weather balloons first. Weather balloons are of the following types:

a. "Radiosonde" - Carries a transmitter and telemetering device for upper-air temperature, pressure and humidity observations. These ascend up to 20' or more in altitude. Carries a parachute and telemetering device under certain conditions which would give radar returns, and might be mistaken for an object under certain conditions.

b. Rawin - Same balloon as above, but it carries only a radar "triangle", and is a wind aloft observation.

c. Rawinsonde - Same, a combination of rawin and radiosonde.

d. Rabal - Same type of balloon, tracked by theodolite for winds aloft observations.

e. Super Skyhook - A large rubber balloon, 30' in diameter at release and 4 or 5' at altitude. Burst and glide comparable to radiosonde. A wind aloft observations carried by theodolite.

In addition, these types of balloons are launched at 0500Z, 0900Z, 1500Z and 2100Z daily. Heavenly bodies may also be mistaken for the balloons, and other diverse phenomena.

JET CHASE from Page 1
The final section of the report goes on to state that after identifying the Air Force planes in the area, the pilot "then lost sight of the UFO". It seems the pilot was given and received permission to determine the nature and source of the UFO sighting.

The report then states that the radar showed he was closing in at a speed of the jet, which was approximately 600 knots (around 700 mph).

At eight miles range the radar showed a round object appeared in the sky, directly where the pilot had reported the UFO. To show up as more than a pinpoint, the UFO had to be quite large, described if a pencil eraser if placed against the windscreen.

The report mentions this object was supplied by North American Aviation, builders of the F-86 Sabrejet, and the Civil Air Patrol had a UFO be about 350 feet in diameter. 

The Air Force report continues, stating the pilot's radar was suddenly jammed by a strong interference, using anti-jam procedures for ten seconds, this eliminated the mysterious interference pulses. Then they regained the radar lock-on, and the jet held its course.

When the jet closed to within five nautical miles of the object, the pilot could not close further as the object suddenly accelerated. After the UFO's flight turn, the pilot's radar indicated that the object had increased its speed to 1800 knots. (Approximately 1900 to 2100 mph). The Air Force report adds this was an estimate, since the UFO's rate of departure was faster than the jet's radar could track.

The seriousness with which the UFO sighting was regarded is indicated by the fact that a Special Advisor to NICAP (the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) was appointed to analyze the case.

All equipment, including the radar, operated correctly. The aircraft then was thoroughly checked by ground personnel, and found to be functioning normally, according to the Intelligence report.

NAVY MISSILE EXPERT
UFO INVESTIGATOR
IS NEW NICAP ADVISER
Captain Robert B. McLaughlin, USN,
Commander of the Naval Ordnance Test
Station, China Lake, California, has been 
appointed a Special Advisor to NICAP.
Captain McLaughlin will be responsible for
evaluating and analyzing UFO reports and evidence referred to NICAP.

NICAP Explanation: At the moment
when the pilot made his relative estimate
of the UFO's size, seeing the object appear 
much larger than his own plane, the UFO
was probably at its closest point in relation
to the jet's altitude.

The size of the object would depend on
its actual size, its distance, and the angle
at which it was seen - whether it appeared 
head-on, broadside, or edgewise. According
to North American Aviation, makers of the
F-86 D Sabrejet, this distance for the
Sabrejet is 2.27 inches, making the UFO's
diameter is at 3,520 feet.

The average pencil eraser is one-fourth
of an inch in diameter. According to the
dimensions confirmed by the Civil Aeronautics
Administration, if the pilot's eyes were
2.50 feet from the windscreen, the object
would have appeared the same size as the
average pencil eraser, or 0.25 feet in
diameter. Even allowing for an appreciable
error in the pilot's estimate, it seems plain
that the UFO must have been at least 500
feet in diameter, and probably much larger.

The significance of this Air Force report
is obvious. It is clear that armed forces
pilots are still encountering unexplained
UFOs - solid, round shaped objects seem- 
ingly under intelligent control - though no 
official still go there is no evidence of their
existence.
