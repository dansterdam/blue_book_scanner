SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Initial narratve text may not be completed un salon report s fully stioned on Para lts. List inclosures, including number of copies)

1. Purported object was never seen in the air so would not come under definition of "UFO", although the observer thought the object came from the air.
   
2. Description of reported object cannot be given because it was below the surface of the water at all times. The commotion in the water caused by the object was all that was seen.

3. Previous checks indicate restricted area AF-i-81 was not in use on data sighting and there were no reports of lost armament or aircraft assembly on same data.

4. The observer neither heard nor saw any aircraft activity in the area within a two hour period of the sighting.
