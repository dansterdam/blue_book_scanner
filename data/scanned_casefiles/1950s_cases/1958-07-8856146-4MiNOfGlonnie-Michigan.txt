RPT ALTHOUGH PHENOMENON OBSERVED FOR ALMOST 2 MINUTES, HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE THREE OBSERVERS IN THE AREA WOULD ALL HAVE HAD THEIR BACKS TURNED TO THE OBJECT AS IT DESCENDED FROM THE SKY.

C. IF OBJ DID NOT COME OUT OF THE AIR AND ONLY AN UNDERWATER COMMOTION WAS OBSERVED, SUCH AS MIGHT BE CAUSED BY AN UNDERGROUND FISSURE, PRESSURE OR OTHER CAUSE THEN OBJ MAY NOT BE A UFO AND THEREFORE NOT SUBJ OF A RPT UNDER AFR 200-2. IF SO MUST BE CONSIDERED AN UFO (UNIDENTIFIED UNDERWATER OBJECT). PART TWO: A. IF DETERMINED OBJECT VALID UFO, REQUEST INVESTIGATION OF INCIDENT WITH THE VIEW OF DETERMINING CAUSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH PAR 4B AND PAR 5B, AFR 200-2. B. REQUEST PAR 5, THIS REG, BE REVIEWED WITH VIEW TO ASSISTING IN THIS MATTER. C. REQ YOUR FINDINGS BE PREPARED ON STANDARD INTELLIGENCE RPT AF FM 112. D. SOME BASIC CLUES IN GUIDANCE TO ASSIST IN THIS MATTER: TRIANGULATION INDICATES THAT INCIDENT TOOK PLACE JUST OUTSIDE NORTHEAST CORNER OF AF RESTRICTED AREA R-81 AND WEST OF RESTRICTED AREA R-91 WHICH ARE USED EXCLUSIVELY BY YOUR BASE FOR AERIAL BOMBING AND GUNNERY. ALSO TWO OTHER RESTRICTED AREAS WEST AND NORTHWEST OF UFO LOCATION USED FOR AERIAL TRAINING AND EXERCISES. MANY AERIAL PARTLY INFLATED BALLOON POSSIBLY FOR ANY NUMBER OF ARMAMENT AND ORDNANCE ITEMS TO HAVE DROPPED OR ACCIDENTALLY DETACHED FROM AIRCRAFT AND FALLING INTO WATER. FOR EXAMPLE, SEMI-DUD BOMBS THAT COULD HAVE EXPLODED UNDER WATER OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF PRESSURE DEVICES HEAVY ENOUGH TO SUBMERGE.

Date of Report: 20 Jul 58
Date of Sighting: 30 Jul 58

Name & Organization: MORSE B. MACKINNON, 1st Lt, USAF
Grade or Position: Woman?

SUBJECT: "UFO" Report, TK 445 INT 633 30/2230/Jul, TK (FCIN-AEL-8-1797-ERE)

Unidentified Flying Object

1. Purported object was never seen in the air so would not come under definition of "UFO", although the observer though the object came from the air.

2. Description of reported object cannot be given because it was below the surface of the water at all times. The commotion in the water caused by the object was all that was seen.

3. Previous checks indicate restricted area AF-R-81 was not in use on date of sighting and there were no reports of lost armament or aircraft assembly on same date.

4. The observer neither heard nor saw any aircraft activity in the area within a two hour period of the sighting.
