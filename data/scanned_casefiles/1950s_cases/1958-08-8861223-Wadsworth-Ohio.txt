1. The object enclosed has apparently been made of yellow brass tubing and hand-crimped.

2. Yellow brass (approximately 65% copper - 35% zinc) is used for architectural grill work, lamp fixtures and other forms of ornamental hardware. It is darkened after polishing usually by heating at 1100Â°F, in a furnace, or in the case of hand-made objects, usually by repeated dipping in oil and burning this oil on the surface. The letter method was apparently used since the inside is slightly lighter in shade than the outside which appears to have been darkened by an amateur.

3. The lettering on the aluminum cap which has been brazed to the one end is hand scratched. Under a glass, it was found to be "St. Louis, Mo. 440" or "445".

4. The object could have been used for any number of purposes such as a fishing pole handle, a lamp fixture, etc. The tubing well, however, is much too thin for cartridge shells.

5. It is felt that a laboratory examination of this object is not justified.
