N.Y. Herald Tribune 11/17/53

• The Air Force last night released this first photo of its new "Flying Stiletto", dagger-shaped research plane designed to fly at 2,000 miles an hour.

A. E. Displays 'Flying Stiletto'
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 (JP)— The Air Force cautiously lifted the secrecy curtain today from its "flying stiletto", a dagger-shaped research plane designed to try 2,000 miles an hour at extreme high altitudes.

The jet-propelled craft, the X-3, was built by Douglas Aircraft under Air Force, Navy and National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) sponsorship at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. For a year but little has been said about its radical design.

The X-3 resembles nothing else now flying. It is a long, sharply tapered nose and stubby airwings. 12 to 15 feet 9 inches long over all, but its wing is a mere 22 feet 8 inch-

[Bottom right of page has an advertisement that reads:]

— Lord & Taylor —

The photograph shows an aircraft with a very long, narrow, pointed design, positioned next to what appears to be a vehicle or another object on the ground.
