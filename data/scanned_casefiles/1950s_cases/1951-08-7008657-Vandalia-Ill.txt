Strange Object in Sky
Baffles Local Airmen

It wasn't a flying saucer. Nor was it a conventional type airplane. But whatever it was, it has aroused the curiosity of at least five persons who saw it soaring through the air Monday night.

"It was a big orange light with a blinding intensity when I first looked it over the southwest corner of the airport," Ray Williams told the Leader. "I had just taxied out onto the runway preparing to take a flight around the city when I noticed the light. It was between 8 and 8:30 pm. I called over the radio to the CAA official on duty Albert Druckle, and to Paul Reese and asked them to take a look.

"The lighted object disappeared into the west and we decided maybe there was nothing to it. So I decided to continue with my flight," Williams stated.

"Shortly after I had taken off I noticed the light again, approaching my plane. I came directly at me and then circled my plane twice before heading toward Greenville. I followed it and it made a circle round that town and came back toward Vandalia. I last saw it near the country club. The CAA radioed a transport pilot who was passing over Vandalia at the time at about 10:00 feet and he too saw the object.

"It was all very spooky," the Vandalia airman said. "It wasn't an airplane but whatever it was the light was on the tail of it, and there was a small red light on top. Probably it was some military craft from Scott Field making a test run."

The lighted object which appeared to have 10 to 12 inch legs, was also seen by Dwight Kerns in St. Elmo the same evening.

VANDALIA, ILLINOIS - 27 August 1951

The only information available on this incident is a newspaper article from Vandalia Leader of 30 August 1951.

It wasn't a flying saucer! Nor was it a conventional type airplane! Whatever it is, it has roused the curiosity of at least five persons who saw it soaring through the air Sunday night.

"It was a big orange light with a dim, dim intensity when I first noticed it over the southwest corner of the airport," I, Williams said. "I had just taxied out onto the runway preparing to take a flight around the city when I noticed the light. It was between 8 and 9:30 p.m. I called over the radio to the CAA official on duty, Albert Arnold, and to Paul Goose and asked them to take a look."

"The lighted object disappeared into the west and we decided maybe there was nothing to it. So I decided to continue with my flight plans," Williams stated.

"Shortly after I had taken off I noticed the light again, approaching my plane. It came directly at me and then circled my plane twice before heading toward the runway. I followed it and at no time a circle was formed and came back toward Vandalia. I last saw it over the country club. The CAA air-space control pilot who was parking over Vandalia at the time at about 6,000 feet an hour saw the object."

"It was all very spooky," the Vandalia airman said. "It wasn't an airplane but whatever it was the light was on the tail of it, and there was a small red light on top. Probably it was some military craft from Scott Field, maybe."

The lighted object which appeared to have a 10 to 12 inch lens, was also seen by other persons in St. Elmo the same evening."

Status of Investigation

An attempt will be made to obtain further information on this incident.

The only information available on this incident is a newspaper article from Vandalia Leader of 30 August 1951.

"It was! It's a flying saucer! Nor was it a conventional type airplane! But whatever it was, it has caused 'the curiosity of at least five persons' who saw it during through the air Monday night.

"It was a big orange light with blinking intensity when I first noticed it over the southwest corner of the airport," Ray Williams told the Leader. "I had just taxied out onto the runway preparing to take a flight around the city when I noticed the light. It was between 8 and 8:30 p.m. I called over the radio to the CAA official on duty Albert Brooks, and to Paul Beadle and asked them to take a look."

"The lighted object disappeared into the west and we decided maybe there was nothing to it. So I decided to continue with my flight plans," Williams stated.

"Shortly after I had taken off I noticed the light again, approaching my plane. I can't say just how close since the plane since before heading toward Greenville. I followed it and it made a circle round that town and came back toward Vandalia. I last saw it near the country club. The CAA raised a transport pilot who was passing over Vandalia at the time at about 10,000 feet and he too saw the object!"
