AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det Fly, 600AB ARSS, APO 950                53-98                PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

On the night of 9 June 1953 at approximately 2345, an unidentified object was observed by forward observers at Btry "B", 29th FA BN.

Witnesses interviewed stated that the object was first sighted over UTM grid coordinates CT623658. The object was flying at an estimated altitude of 15,000 feet on an easterly heading. This object was observed from a distance of approximately 7,000 yards for an estimated four (4) minutes. The observations were visual and with the aid of a B.C. Scope (Artillery range finder). Neither at the time of the observation was CAVU.

The object was described as being spherical in shape. Its color was fluorescent gray or silver. No method of propulsion or exhaust was observed. No horizontal or vertical features could be seen. The witnesses were unable to give any dimensions. The object appeared to be splashing in an erratic flight. It circled to the east for approximately four (4) minutes. Several times the object appeared to almost stop; distinctly decelerating, and then increasing speed. The object was last seen traveling at a high rate of speed and disappeared to the northeast.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

Insufficient information could be obtained by investigators to establish the identity of the above object. Any conclusions at this level would be purely conjectural.

D/I FEAF COMMENT:

There have been many unidentified sightings reported from the CT and DZ grid areas several which have been definitely been identified as balloons. Although range was evidently measured in this case, no estimate of size or speed was given. From the limited description given, it is believed the object may have been a lighted balloon launched by enemy front-line troops. To further investigation being made.
