Performing OCR on the text in the document:

ON the night of 9 June 1952 at approximately 2:24 a.m. an unidentified object was observed in the sky near Pyongyang, North Korea.

Grid witnesses interviewed stated that the object was first sighted at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet and appeared to be spherical in shape. The color was described as luminous or phosphorescent. The size was estimated to be approximately 7,000 yards in diameter. The observations were made for a period of approximately 45 minutes.

The object was described as being spherical in shape. Its color was described as luminous or phosphorescent. The size was estimated to be approximately 7,000 yards in diameter. The observations were made for a period of approximately 45 minutes.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

Information was obtained by investigators to establish the identity of the above object. Any conclusions at this level would be purely speculative.

D/I PJAF COMMENTS:

There have been many unidentified sightings reported from the G2 and DI grid areas, several of which have definitely been identified as balloons. Although a program was recently instituted by the Far East Command to investigate these sightings, no further investigation being made.
