STATEMENT OF
MRS. FRANK CODY

24 September 1952

About 10:00 P.M. on September 23, 1952, while I was in the bedroom, I noticed five (5) blush grey lights moving slowly across the sky. To impress it was a helicopter because of the way it was flying, I soon realized it wasn't and went outside to see what it was. I watched the lights slowly pass overhead and disappear behind the trees. As the lights passed overhead I heard a soft though sound. The sound was not the sound of a jet airplane. I watched the lights for approximately three (3) minutes. The objects appeared out of the south and disappeared in the northwest. They moved in a straight line, but I could not say what the exact height was. I had the impression that there was a grey background to the lights. The lights were arranged in a semicircle pattern and appeared as in the following diagram.

[A hand-drawn diagram of five oval/elliptical shapes arranged in a curved/semicircle pattern]

A few minutes later a small airplane flew over. The lights in relation to the small airplane were lower. Slow slower, and did not hear any resonance as in the lights of the small airplane. The size of the group of lights was slightly bigger than the small airplane.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama

REPORT NO.
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

Details: At approximately 1000 hrs, the Base Operations Officer at Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama, received a telephone call from a Mrs. [redacted], Chickasaw, Alabama. Mrs. [redacted] reported seeing a group of five (5) lights, bluish-grey in color at about 2200 hours, 23 September 1952. Base Operations notified the Air Transport Group, MAB.

Provost Marshal who in turn notified the Intelligence and Briefing Officer, 1703rd Air Transport Group, MAB.

In company with the Intelligence Officer, 1703rd Transport Group, the Asst. Intelligence Officer, HQMA, conducted an investigation.

A statement was obtained from Mrs. [redacted] (Enclosure #1). All airports in the vicinity were checked for the possibility that the lights were airplanes. The only aircraft in the vicinity were a C-46 which departed from Brookley Air Force Base at 2212, and a C-74 which departed from Brookley Air Force Base at 2234. The small light airplane which Mrs. [redacted] has not been identified. The reliability of the observer was highly questionable. The lights were airborne, and, therefore, could not have been the objects which the observer saw. The observer had a difficult time describing the lights, although no details could be seen. The sound was similar to a small airplane gliding, but definitely not the sound of jet aircraft. The weather and wind aloft (Enclosure #2) were approximately opposite to the direction of flight of the objects, eliminating the possibility the objects were weather balloons.

The lighted objects were sighted at latitude 30° 46' N, longitude 88° 08' W. The true course was approximately 45°, altitude approximately 2,000 feet. The speed could not be judged, but appeared to be slower than a small airplane (75 mph). Several other persons in the area were questioned, but no other sightings were reported.

The reliability of the observer is evaluated as excellent. Mrs. [redacted] has enough experience to distinguish between light aircraft, jets, and heavy transports.

Since the report was not received until twelve (12) hours after observation, interpretation was not attempted.

1. The following report is submitted in compliance with the provisions of paragraph 7, Air Force Letter 20-5, dated 29 April 1952.

2. At approximately 1900 hours the Base Operations Officer at Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama, received a telephone call from a Mrs. [redacted], Chicago, Illinois, who reported that five (5) lights, Chicago, Illinois, were about 2200 hours 23 November 1952 Base Operations notified the Air Provost Marshal who in turn notified the Intelligence and Briefing Officer, 1703rd Air Transport Group.

3. In company with the Assistant Intelligence Officer, MCAAF, Lieutenant Elliott, and the Intelligence Officer, 1703rd Air Transport Group, conducted an investigation.

4. A statement was obtained from [redacted] (enclosure #1). All airports in the vicinity were checked for the possibility that the lights were airplanes. The only airplanes in the vicinity were a C-54 which departed from Brookley Air Force Base at 2120 hours, a C-46 which departed from Brookley Air Force Base at 2203 hours. The small light airplanes, which were airborne. The reliability of the observer made it highly improbable that the lights were aircraft. The C-54 would have been at 3,000 to 4,000 feet, and thereafter, could not have been the source which the observer saw. The observer had a definite impression that there was a grayish background to the lights, although no details could be seen. The sound was similar to a small airplane gliding, but definitely not the sound of a jet aircraft.

The weather and winds aloft (enclosure #2) which were approximately opposite to the direction of flight of the objects, indicates the possibility that the objects were weather balloons.

LIGHT SIGNAL PROCEDURES FOR AIRPORT TRAFFIC CONTROL

The following procedures are used by airport traffic control between towers in the aeronautical communications system with radio. These procedures are used to assist aircraft in maintaining safe and efficient operations.

Although the traffic signal light offers the advantage that work may be done with radio-equipped aircraft, all pilots should be cognizant of the disadvantages which are:

1. The pilot may not be looking at the control tower at the time a signal is demonstrated at a pilot's anticipated location.

2. The directions transmitted by a light signal are very limited since only a few characters may be transmitted. No supplementary or explanatory information except by the use of the "General Warning Signal" which advises the pilot to be on the alert.

Signals from a portable traffic control light shall mean the following:

[Table showing color and type of signal meanings on ground and in flight]

TRAFFIC PATTERN INDICATED BY SEGMENTED CIRCLE

[Diagram showing a segmented circle with traffic pattern and landing strip indicators]

Safe flying requires that a pilot know the traffic pattern for the airport. Illustrated above, furnished by the FAA, is a diagram showing the standard traffic pattern. Pilots flying in the pattern should fly with the circle marker. They tell the pilot to move in the pattern in the direction indicated by the arrows.

AFB, Alabama

Submitted in accordance with AF Reg. No. 200-5, dated 20 April 1952, Subj: Unidentified
Flying Objects Reporting.

At approximately 2200 CDT, 23 September 1952, an unidentified flying object was
observed visually for three minutes by a civilian from surface position at
Chickasaw, Alabama, 30° 16' N - 88° 05' W at an estimated altitude of approximately 4,000', traveling from southeasterly direction on a true course of approximately
45°; speed estimated at about 75 MPH.

Object appeared as five (5) steady bluish-gray lights arranged in an unidentified
pattern covering an area slightly larger than a small airplane. As object passed
overhead, it emitted a soft "swoosh" sound - unlike sound of jet aircraft. Observer
had impression of being very high powered unusual flying lights.

Airborne aircraft in vicinity: C-46 departed Brockley AFB 2122 hours.
C-74 departed Brockley AFB 2209 hours.
Unidentified small a/c passed over observer
a few minutes after unidentified objects
disappeared.

Weather: 2100 - clear, 7 mile visibility, 70° temperature, dew point 59°, wind
SW at 14 MPH. FEW 7 scattered clouds at 10,000'. Visibility 7 miles, temperature
at point - 59° plus - RHH at 11 MPH. Winds aloft: (1) 2000 ft - 60° & 25 knots;
(2) 4000 ft - 50° & 25 knots; (3) 6000 ft - 90° & 25 knots; (4) 8000 ft - 90° &

"On the 23 of September, while camping on the north shore of Gander Lake, Newfoundland, Major [redacted] observed a very bright white light moving over the hills on the south shore of Gander Lake. The object moved from west to east, in the general direction of Gander Airport, a distance of 25 miles. It was moving rather slowly, at a speed estimated at not over 100 mph. A reflection of the light was visible on the calm surface of the lake. The object was not higher than an altitude of 1000 feet above the hills. The night air was calm, and no noise could be heard for great distances. At the time the object was sighted no sound was heard. Aircraft arriving and departing Gander Airport were plainly audible. The light disappeared after descending to approximately 500 feet above the hills in the general direction of Gander Airport. The total observed time was between 3 and 10 minutes. The weather was CAVU. There were seven other people in the camp who observed this object."
