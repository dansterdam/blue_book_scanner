STATEMENT OF 
MRS. FRANK GOODY

24 September 1952

About 10:00 P.M. on September 23, 1952, while I was in the bedroom, I noticed a bright light moving swiftly across the sky. For first impression it looked like a helicopter because of the very broad lights I saw. As it approached I suddenly realized it was not a helicopter, but some sort of craft which I will call flying objects. I called my husband and he also saw the same objects. There were six or eight objects in a group formation that passed over us in an easterly direction. They were flying very high and silently. I could see no outline or shape of the objects, only the bright lights. The sound we did not hear. The objects passed over and disappeared in the distance, sort of melting away. The impression they gave to me was that they were not attached to each other, but were separate independent units. I watched them until they were out of sight. The lights became dimmer and dimmer until they disappeared completely.

I am submitting a small sketch of what I observed. The lights at the bottom represent a small airplane-like object which I saw. This object was flying lower than the group of lights, and did not belong to the group of lights. The size of the lights of the small airplane were slightly larger than lights of the other group of lights, and the flight path of the small object was slightly different from the group of lights. I cannot account for the small airplane-like object I saw, nor can I account for the group of lights. I only know what I saw and I would be glad to discuss this with you further if desired.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO.
FROM (ACTIVITY)
Intelligence Officer
Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama
DETAILS

Detailed at approximately 1000 hrs. the Base Operations Officer at Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama, received a telephone call from a Mrs. Childress, Alabama. Mrs. Childress reported a group of five (5) light, bluish-gray colored lights which appeared at about 2200 hours, 19 September 1952. The Base Operations Officer notified the Air Intelligence Officer, who conducted the investigation.

In company with the Intelligence Officer, 1703rd Transport Group, the Ass't. Intelligence Officer, USAAF, conducted an investigation.

An examination of the data furnished by Mrs. Childress (P.2). All reports in the vicinity were checked for the possibility that any lights were airplanes. The only aircraft in the area at 2122 hrs. was a T-33 which departed from Brookley Air Force Base at 2224, and a B-47 which departed from the same base at 2234. The sighting described by Mrs. Childress definitely could not have been explained by these aircraft.

It is probable that the lights were aircraft. The B-47 would have been at 30,000 to 35,000 feet and the observer had a definite impression that there was a twilight background to the sighting. Furthermore, the sound of jet aircraft was not heard. The weather did not indicate the possibility of a thermal inversion, which could have been responsible for the sighting. The B-47 would have been at 30,000 to 35,000 feet and the observer had a definite impression that there was a twilight background to the sighting. Furthermore, the sound of jet aircraft was not heard.

The lighted objects were sighted at latitude 30* 48' N, longitude 88* 08' W. They were observed to be at an altitude of approximately 5,000 (75 mph). Their speed could not be accurately determined, but they appeared to be moving at a speed in excess of 500 mph. Other persons in the area were questioned, but no other sightings were reported.

The reliability of the observer is evaluated as excellent. Mrs. Childress is a housewife, apparently in good mental and physical condition, and is considered to be a reliable observer.

Since the report was not received until twelve (12) hours after observation, interpretation and analysis has been complicated.

Att: Intelligence Officer
Kelly Air Force Base, Texas

1. The following report is submitted in compliance with the provisions of paragraph 7, Air Force Letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952.

2. On 22 February 1952, ai 3:45 PM, PU Damon, an employee of Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation, reported to the Kirtland Air Force Base Intelligence Officer that he had observed five (5) light, disc-shaped objects flying in the vicinity of Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The objects were observed for approximately three (3) minutes, moving from east to west at a high rate of speed, and estimated to be about 22,000 feet in altitude. A qualified aerial observer who is a defense-contractor employee was also notified the intelligence and briefing officer, 1/0 Capt.

3. In company with the Assistant Intelligence Officer, 1/LT , the intelligence officer, 1/0 Capt previously mentioned, conducted an investigation.

4. As a result of the investigation, the following facts were obtained: (1) All informants are reliable and have had past experience in observing and reporting aerial phenomena.
 (2) The objects were observed during daylight hours from the ground as well as from a C-47 aircraft at an altitude of 15,500 feet.
 (3) Tha oBgects were elliptical or disc-shaped, grayish in color, and estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter. They moved at a high rate of speed, from east to west, and appeared and disappeared at intervals. (4) No sounds were heard and no trails were observed.
(5) The relative speed of the objects was estimated to be approximately 1,200 miles per hour. This is considerably in excess of the maximum speed capabilities of any known aircraft.
(6) All informants are agreed as to the general description of the objects and the details of the observation.
(7) Weather conditions were clear and the sky was free of clouds.

5. It is the considered opinion of the intelligence officer that the objects observed do not conform to any known type of aerial vehicle, and their characteristics indicate the possibility of extra-terrestrial origin. Further investigation is being conducted, and any additional significant information will be reported.

This page of the Project Blue Book document contains a diagram and text describing "Light Signal Procedures for Airport Traffic Control". The diagram illustrates a "Traffic Pattern Indicated by Segmented Circle" and provides instructions for various light signal colors and their meanings for pilots, both on the ground and in flight. There is no photograph present in this particular page.

LIGHT SIGNAL PROCEDURES FOR AIRPORT TRAFFIC CONTROL
The text provides detailed information about the different light signal colors and their meanings, including:
- Steady Green: Cleared for takeoff
- Flashing Green: Cleared to land
- Steady Red: Stop
- Flashing Red: Taxi clear of landing area
- Flashing White: Return to starting point on airport
- Alternating Red & Green: General warning signal

The diagram shows a segmented circle that indicates the traffic pattern, as well as the location of the wind indicator and landing strip indicator.

The document is written in typewritten text and has the heading "FOR THE COMMANDING OFFICER" at the top. It lists 3 names, likely the report recipients, under the heading "TO:". There is a section of redacted text that appears to describe an incident or observation. The last line lists "C. E. RAINES, Captain, U.S.A.F." as the author of the document.

The writer states that he is willing to do whatever is required in the way of additional investigation or information to give the case proper consideration. However, he may not do so since he does not have his address listed on this report.

I would like to comment, however, that I am very well acquainted with this case as I have known the writer for approximately ten years.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unidentified Flying Objects Report (FLYOBPT)
Location: Newfoundland
DATE OF INCIDENT: 1 October 1952 
TIME: 23 September 1952, 2358 hours 
Reported by: MAJOR E.C. CAWTRELL, USAF, Group Intelligence Officer, Pepperrell AFB
SUMMARY: At approximately 2358 hours on 23 September 1952, while camping on the north shore of Gander Lake, Newfoundland, Major E.C. Cawtrell, USAF, observed a very bright white light, moving over the lake in a north-south direction at high speed. The light was estimated to be moving at a speed of not over 100 mph. As the light approached, it appeared to slow down and then seem to stop in mid-air at an altitude of 2000 feet above the low range of hills. The light then began to descend, disappeared briefly and then reappeared at a higher altitude of approximately 3000 feet. It then began to ascend gradually and was sighted as descending at approximately 500 feet per minute. The light disappeared after descending to approximately 1500 feet. The total observed time was between 5 and 10 minutes. The weather at the time was CAVU. There were several other people in the camp who observed this object.
