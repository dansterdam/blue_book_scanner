The objects changed course and speed frequently and disappeared as if they had turned off their lights. The objects were visible for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

3. Observation took place at 33.54N 101.52W in the city of Lubbock. Objects appeared to be approximately 5 miles due east point of observation at an estimated altitude of 2000 to 3000 feet.
