Transcription:

1. To commence with the 15 August 1952, the military authorities released a statement to the effect that the reported sightings of unidentified flying objects over the Killeen base, Texas, were found to be of natural origin. The report went on to state that further investigation of these sightings was no longer necessary and that the matter was now closed.

2. The sighting reports expended on a page and one-half of closely typed material. Of these, 12 were reports from various military personnel, including control tower operators, who had seen the objects and who had been interviewed and questioned by the investigating officers. The consensus was that the objects were not identifiable as conventional aircraft, balloons, or other known objects. There were numerous other sightings reported by civilians, but these were not included in the project files.

3. Local area (including Koco, Texas) investigations were conducted by the on-site personnel, and their conclusions were as follows: 

a. A organizational training is not the likely cause.
b. A report of miner is without merit.
c. A unidentified vehicle is in the sky.
d. A known weather condition is invalid.
