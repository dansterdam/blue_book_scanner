[Partially legible text in the body of the document, which appears to read:]

...spotted high over the Oakland-Fremont area of California last December. It was seen by two watchers at the Calavari Airport control tower. The object was at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet when first spotted. It then moved at a fantastic speed, and appeared into a white, vaporous cloud. The UFO was seen both the altitude of two commercial planes in the area.

RAPID CITY, S.D., DEC. 16--(UPI)--THE WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED FROM THE STRATOBEL NEAR RAPID CITY TODAY ON A COSMIC RAY EXPLORATION TEST FLIGHT.

THE UNHARMED, 10,000,000 (1) CUBIC FOOT BALLOON WAS SENT ALOFT WITH A 150-POUND TEST LOAD AND PREPARATION FOR A SERIES OF COSMIC RAY RESEARCH BALLOONS WHICH WILL BE SENT UP NEXT MONTH FROM NAVAL VESSELS IN THE CARIBBEAN.

STRONG STRATOSPHERIC WINDS WERE EXPECTED TO CARRY THE BALLOON TO LOUISIANA WHERE AUTOMATIC CONTROLS WILL LAND IT TOMORROW.

THE BALLOON IS 441 FEET LONG AND 300 FEET IN DIAMETER. AT CEILING ALTITUDE OF 120,000 FEET IT WILL DISPLACE 10,000,000 CUBIC FEET OF AIR.

THE WORLD'S PREVIOUSLY LARGEST BALLOON WAS 5,380,000 CUBIC FEET.

THE BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED BY WINZEN RESEARCH OF MINNEAPOLIS FOR THE OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH.

over Willoughby, Ohio on Thursday, 10
December by Mrs. Arnold T. Dundy and
two other housewives, Mrs. Dundy said
there was a loud sound like a clap of
thunder, but nothing like the usual sonic
booms heard in the area. The moon was
full and the time was 9 p.m. Three jets
in the air appeared at about the same
time last the object did, but they were
above it and northbound. The object,
headed east, shot straight up and left
appeared, leaving a trail of orange-like
flame.

    TEXAN THINKS HE SAW WORLD'S LARGEST, LOST BALLOON
    LEAD RAPID CITY (AA3)
    JUNCTION, TEX., DEC. 16.--(UPI)--GEORGE DONNELL, A SAN ANTONIO
CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT, WAS DRIVING NEAR JUNCTION LAST NIGHT
WHEN HE SAW SOMETHING IN THE SKY THAT MADE HIM SIT STRAIGHT UP IN HIS
CAR SEAT.
    IT WAS A HUGE, OBLONG SHAPE AND DONNELL DESCRIBED IT LIKE THIS:
    "WHATEVER I SAW WAS 12 TO 15 TIMES LARGER THAN THE BIGGEST STAR IN
SIGHT.
    "I LOST SIGHT OF IT IN THE OVERCAST BEFORE I COULD TELL WHAT IT
REALLY WAS.  BUT IT WAS FLOATING SLOWLY AT ABOUT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE."
    DONNELL HAD HEARD ON HIS RADIO THAT THE WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON
AND A BRILLIANT ORANGE AND WHITE PARACHUTE, YR FEET IN DIAMETER, GOT
LOST MONDAY AT RAPID CITY, S.D.
    SO DONNELL CALLED THE WEATHER BUREAU AS SOON AS HE GOT HOME.
JUNCTION, WHERE HE SAW THE SHAPE IN THE SKY, IS IN SOUTHWEST TEXAS,
260 MILES FROM THE NEW MEXICO BORDER.
    SAN ANTONIO METEOROLOGISTS CHECKED WIND DIRECTIONS AND SAID HE
COULD HAVE SEEN A BALLOON OR PARACHUTE.  THEY ALSO SAID THE WIND
COULD HAVE CARRIED IT INTO NEW MEXICO.

WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON GETS LOST ON MAIDEN FLIGHT
RAPID CITY, S.D., DEC. 16--(UPI)--"IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A GORGEOUS
SIGHT," THE NAVY SPOKESMAN MUSED.
AND IT PROBABLY WAS, IF ANYBODY SAW IT---A BRILLIANT ORANGE AND
WHITE PARACHUTE, 64 FEET IN DIAMETER, PLACIDLY FLOATING EARTHWARD
FROM WHERE THE WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON WAS PLACIDLY LOST.
AT LEAST EVERYBODY THINKS THE PARACHUTE FLOATED EARTHWARD WITH
A PAYLOAD OF COSMIC RAY MEASURING EQUIPMENT YESTERDAY. SOMEWHERE IN
TEXAS, OR LOUISIANA, OR ALABAMA, OR EVEN MISSISSIPPI.
HERE'S HOW THE WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON AND THE WORLD'S MOST
GORGEOUS PARACHUTE GOT LOST:
MONDAY--LAUNCHED ONE BALLOON, TALLER THAN 34-STORY RKO BUILDING IN
NEW YORK, FROM RAPID CITY. MISSION: TO GO UP TO 120,000 FEET AND
COME BACK DOWN TUESDAY WITHOUT GETTING LOST.
LOST: ONE BALLOON, 411 FEET LONG AND 300 FEET IN DIAMETER, CARRYING
1,860-POUND LOAD OF BALLAST AND SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT. LOCATION: OVER
NEBRASKA. LOSING: ONE NAVY TRACKING PLANE FORCED DOWN IN BAD WEATHER.
TUESDAY--BALLOON, MADE OF PLASTIC 1,000 OR AN INCH THICK,
BELIEVED DRIFTING OVER JULESBURG, COLO. NAVY PLANE GETS INTO AIR
AGAIN AT NORTH PLATTE, NEB., SEARCHES FOR ANYTHING RESEMBLING NEW
YORK'S RKO BUILDING, NO LUCK.
RESULT: PLANE UNABLE TRIGGER A MECHANISM TO RELEASE BALLOON PAYLOAD,
RADAR TECHNICIANS UNABLE KEEP TRACK OF BALLOON WITHOUT PLANE CONTACT.
THEORIZED, BALLOON LOST. SIGNS: RECRIMINATIONS.
AT 1 P.M. (CST) TUESDAY: GORGEOUS PARACHUTE FLOATS EARTHWARD
SOMEWHERE IN GULF STATES, WHILE WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON SILENTLY FOLDS
UP ITS PLASTIC BAG AND SNEAKS EARTHWARD, OR SO OFFICIALS BELIEVE.
A SPOKESMAN FOR WINZEN RESEARCH CO., MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., DESIGNERS
OF THE BALLOON, SAID THE BALLOON CONTAINED AUTOMATIC DEVICES WHICH
WOULD HAVE CUT THE PAYLOAD LOOSE AT A PEAK. YESTERDAY.
THE BALLOON WOULD HAVE LANDED ABOUT 30 MILES FROM THE PAYLOAD,
"IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY IN A REMOTE SPOT," SAID THE NAVY SPOKESMAN.
"IT'S NOT CRITICAL HE CAN'T FIND BACK," HE ADDED, "BUT WE
WOULD LIKE IT TO FILL THE BLANK SPOTS IN OUR DATA."
"WE'VE HAD INSTANCES WHERE THE INSTRUMENTS ARE RETURNED INTACT
MONTHS AFTER THEY LAND," HE SAID. "THE PLASTIC IS USUALLY USED BY SOME
FARMER TO COVER HIS HAYSTACK. IT HAS NO FURTHER USE TO US."
NAVY OFFICIALS SAID THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO TEST THE
FEASIBILITY OF USING A BALLOON OF SUCH SIZE TO LIFT HEAVY INSTRUMENT
LOADS IN EXPERIMENTS IN THE CARIBBEAN NEXT SUMMER.
THE NAVY DIDN'T COMMENT ON THE FEASIBILITY OF USING BALLOONS THAT
GET LOST.
AS FOR THE FLIGHT OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON, IT WAS
"SUCCESSFUL," THE NAVY SAID.

UPI WATCH NO NIGHT LEAD BALLOON

FULTON, MISS., DEC. 17--(UPI)--THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BALLOON, LOST IN THE STRATOSPHERE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES FOR NEARLY TWO DAYS, WAS FOUND PUNCTURED AND DEFLATED IN A NORTH MISSISSIPPI PINE WOODS TODAY.

ITS 200-POUND INSTRUMENTED PAYLOAD TO MEASURE COSMIC RADIATION WAS UNDAMAGED AND INTACT.

BUT THE ORANGE AND WHITE PLASTIC SHROUD WAS DRAPED OVER NEARLY AN ACRE OF PINE. IT WAS HEAVILY POACHED BY LITTLE TITAN, A SCHOOLTEACHER'S NEPHEW, WHO DISCOVERED IT DANGLING HIGH NEAR EUPAL THORNBERRY, A NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLTEACHER, WENT OUT TO FEED HER CHICKENS.

SHE NOTICED SOMETHING STRANGE IN THE WOODS, A PHENOMENA WHICH APPEARED LIKE A SNOWFALL.

"IT LOOKED LIKE THE TOPS OF THE TREES WERE COVERED WITH SNOW," MRS. THORNBERRY SAID. "THEN THEY TOLD ME THE TRACK WAS LOST.

THE BALLOON WAS SENT ALOFT MONDAY NEAR RAPID CITY, S.D. IT WAS TRACKED FOR PART OF ITS FLIGHT, BUT A SNOW STORM, FOG AND CLOUDS CLOSED AROUND IT OVER AN AREA OF MANY MILES TUESDAY AND ITS TRACK WAS LOST.

THE HUGE BALLOON, TALLER THAN A 31-STORY BUILDING WHEN INFLATED, WAS EXPECTED TO DESCEND SOMEWHERE IN LOUISIANA BY WEDNESDAY. AIR CURRENTS, HOWEVER, PUSHED IT ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER FROM ARKANSAS AND IT FELL SILENTLY LAST NIGHT INTO THE WOODS NEAR THE ALABAMA-MISSISSIPPI STATE LINE.

THE BALLOON WAS SENT UP AS PART OF A SERIES OF COSMIC RAY RESEARCH TESTS CONDUCTED BY THE U.S. GEODETIC SURVEY AND WINZEN RESEARCH CORP.

MRS. THORNBERRY'S NEPHEW, PHILLIPS SHEFFIELD 18, INVESTIGATED THE PLACE SHROUD AND FOUND A TAG WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON NOTIFYING AUTHORITIES. SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES CARTED THE PAYLOAD TO THE NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY IN FULTON AND SOUVENIR HUNTERS RIPPED THE PLASTIC SHROUD TO PIECES.

THE BALLOON WAS SUPPOSED TO REACH AN ALTITUDE OF 125,000 FEET. INFLATED IT WAS 411 FEET LONG AND 300 FEET IN DIAMETER.

BOWL-SHAPED OBJECT
IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA

At 11:50 p.m. 22 Dec. Kenneth Lindsley
Jr., 30 of Oakdale, Calif., was walking in
the vicinity of Clarks Road and McHenry Avenue when he spotted a "bowl-
shaped" object coming down out of the
clouds toward him. He estimated its
altitude in about 1,000 feet when he
first saw it. Its color was bright orange.

At first he thought it might have been
a reflection of the moon but remembered
later that the moon didn't rise until
about 1:30 a.m. The object dropped to
about 20 feet above the road and was
throwing a reflection on the road so
bright that Lindsley could see both sides
of the road and the trees very clearly.
He said it stayed down near the road
for about two minutes, then went back
up into the air. Lindsley, unerred, head-
ed back to Modesto to say with a

friend, instead of continuing to hitchhike
home to Oakdale as formerly planned.
He had walked about 1½ miles and was
at the location of the new McHenry
Road when I spotted the object again.
This time it did not come down nearly
as close and did not stay so long. The
second appearance was at 12:45 a.m.

He told of his experience to reporters,
hoping that corroborating witnesses could
be located. His story appeared in the
24 December Stockton, California Record, and Mrs. Estelle Hendershot of
Waterford came forward to report that
she had seen the object while driving to
her home at about 12:15 a.m., after
getting off work at the John Inglis Frozen
Food plant in Modesto. Other women on
the night shift saw the object, also, and
Mrs. Charles Zickfoose, of Modesto reported seeing the object from her home.

The Modesto Bee carried the story,
which yielded this further information:
Lindsley told a Bee reporter that "I
extended over the entire road and on it
I could see shadows which appeared to
be moving but I could not distinguish
what they were. It took about a minute
and a half to get down, stopping just
above the telephone poles. It stayed there
two minutes, then went back up into the

On the eve of the beginning of 1960, over Boston on December 29 a UFO with blue and yellow lights was sighted by residents of several suburbs. The Boston Weather Bureau reported that it received many calls, but was unable to provide an explanation for the phenomena.

Memo, AFCIN-4846, 29 Dec 59, Subj: UFO Sighting
1st Ind (AFCIN-4814/Capt. Keriakov/jc/74201)                20 Jan 60

TO:    AFCIN-4846

1.    An evaluation of this report indicates that the UFO is probably a balloon as stated in the basic report.

2.    An analysis of the winds aloft, track direction and distance covered by track, indicates a target ground speed of approximately 40 knots/hr. This order of ground speed is compatible with a balloon track. The area of sighting is in New Mexico, where there is considerable activity using balloons, in conjunction with various test programs.

3.    To further substantiate this report, are results of a recent test conducted by Rome Air Development Center, which definitely proved that ground radar will detect balloons in flight, and the radar scope point is comparable to an aircraft return.

ASTRONOMY

Orion Visible
Finest Display of bright first magnitude stars is seen
in the sky. Also observable is the interesting double "eclipsing
variable" star, Algol, in the constellation of Perseus.

By JAMES STOKLEY

NO NAKED EYE planets appear in the
coming skies during December this year,
but their loss is not very noticeable. The
display of stars at this season is the finest
that we can ever see.

The stars are shown on the accompany-
ing maps, which are drawn to depict the
skies as they look now (on standard time)
at the first of middle December, an hour earlier at the end
of the month. The great constellation of
Orion, which stands in the southeast, is
the most conspicuous group and you can
easily recognize it by the three stars in a
row that form the belt of this warrior, as
the old star maps represented him. Modern
astronomers pay no attention to these an-
cient fancies.

Above and to the left of the belt you see
the first magnitude star Betelgeuse (in one
of Orion's shoulders). Another, called Rigel
is below, and to the right. This is one
of his legs. Rigel, incidentally, is an ex-
tremely bright star, as measured by its
actual luminosity, for it is about 6,000
times brighter than our sun. If the sun
were at Rigel's distance (200 light years)
we would need a telescope to see it.

Below Orion is Canis Major, the great
dog, with the star called Sirius. This ap-

pears to be the brightest star in the night
time sky, although its low altitude at pre-
sent dims it a little. Sirius, however, is only
about 20 times as bright as the sun; it ap-
pears so bright because it is relatively close,
at a distance of 8.7 light years. A light
year is the distance light travels in a year
at a speed of 186,000 miles per second, or
about six trillion miles.

Above Orion stands Taurus, the bull. Its
brightest star—distinctly red in color—is
called Aldebaran. To the left of Taurus,
in the northern half of the sky, you will see
Auriga, the charioteer, with another first
magnitude star, Capella. Below this group
are Gemini, the twins, with Castor and
Pollux. The latter is the brightest of these
two stars. Still lower is the lesser dog,
Canis Minor, with Procyon.

Thus, around Betelgeuse as a center,
there are six bright stars: Sirius, Procyon,
Pollux, Capella, Aldebaran and Rigel. These
are all of the first magnitude, or brighter.
No other part of the sky contains so many
in the same area.

Two others are visible toward the north-
west. Close to the horizon—and therefore
considerably dimmed—is Vega, of Lyra, the
lyre. And a little higher is Cygnus, the
swan, with Deneb, also fainter now than
when it is overhead.

Orion Visible
(Continued from p. 360)

Although there is no naked-eye planet in the December evening skies, Uranus rises a little later than the time for which these maps are drawn. It is in Leo, the lion, but is too faint to be seen without a telescope.

About three hours ahead of sunrise Venus appears in the east, in the constellation of Libra, the scales. Its magnitude is minus 3.8, which is about seven times as bright as Sirius, so it is easily located. Mercury is just west of the sun on Dec. 12. For a few days around this date it will be visible in the southeast just before sunrise.

On Tuesday, Dec. 22, at 9:35 a.m., E.S.T., winter begins in the Northern Hemisphere. Then the sun is farthest south and directly over a point on the Tropic of Capricorn. The sun will be at its highest for people in southerly countries, so for them it is the beginning of summer.

For those of us who live in the north temperate zone, Dec. 22 is the shortest day of the year—meaning by "day", of course, the time from sunrise to sunset. But the word also refers to the period of time from one noon to the next, and it is noon when the sun is on the meridian, or directly south.

But if, with an accurate stop-watch, you were to time the sun from noon to noon, you would not find it to be exactly 24 hours. You would perform this experiment about the middle of February or May, the end of August, or the beginning of November. At the end of March the day is about 17 seconds short of 24 hours. In early September it is about 13 seconds longer. By then it starts lengthening to its maximum of the year, at about Christmas Day. The day is now nearly half a minute longer than the nominal time of 24 hours. Thus, when Northern Hemisphere daylight is at its shortest, the day itself is longest.

The reason for this effect is that the sun's apparent motion around the sky from west to east during the year is not uniform. If you could see the stars behind the sun as it moves in the direction of Sagittarius, the arc would be visible as a path with a somewhat uneven surface. But the next day you would find that its own diameter as measured from its very backbone. The distance it moves is greater now than at any other time of year.

This means that the sun is delayed in getting back to the meridian, because its easterly motion across the sky partly offsets the daily westward movement from sunrise to sunset. The delay is greater, now that the eastward movement is at a maximum. In March, when it is at a minimum, the delay is least, and the length of day is about 15 seconds. Shorter than in last Christmas time.

Because it would be inconvenient to have clocks that had to run last at some times

of year and slow others, we reckon time from a fictitious body, called the "mean sun", which moves uniformly around the sky. This is the reason that sundial time does not agree with dial time. The mean dial may get more than 15 minutes ahead or behind, or nearly that much behind.

During December the constellation of Perseus is seen to good advantage, for it is directly overhead at a convenient hour. (Its position is shown on the maps.) In Perseus stands the star called Algol, which is a famous variable, i.e., one that regularly changes in brightness.

Normally it is of the second magnitude, or about as bright as the pole star, but every two days and 21 hours it is about a third of that brightness. It takes five hours to dim, and five more to return to normal. In the Celestial Time Table at the end of this article times when Algol is at minimum brightness during evening hours are listed, so if you look at it on these occasions, you will find it light reduced.

Two-Starred Algol

Actually, Algol consists of two stars. One is about 27 times as big as the sun and the other is still larger, although it is about a fifteenth as bright. These two stars revolve around a point between them—the center of gravity—once in two days 20 hours and 49 minutes.

On each revolution, as seen from our direction, the faint star passes in front of the bright one and causes a partial eclipse. Algol is the best-known example of a class of stars called "eclipsing variables." In addition there are many other stars that are truly variable. These are single orbs, in which some internal disturbance makes a variation in the output of light.

During the first week of December
(no exact date) 7 employees at the Kytec
Corp. Power Plant at Cheshire, Ohio,
reported seeing an unidentified object in
the area. We are attempting to obtain
more information, for this power plant
furnishes power for the Atomic Energy
Plant at Portsmouth, and this is at least
the second time a maneuvering or hovering UFO has been spotted in the vicinity
- the first time, November 1957.

POLICE SPOT SAUCER
IN CALIFORNIA
Fontana, Calif., 1 December 1959.--
Police Sgt. Robert L. Cochran and Reserve Officer W. B. Branson were patrolling east Fontana at 9:31 p.m. when they spotted a large, round object which glowed red and white. Spotted from the intersection of Barnes and Palmetto Avenue, the object was at 7 o'clock on the horizon, gave off so much light that it lit up the area. The two men drew a sketch which showed a lens-shaped, shared object projected high toward the sky.

A few minutes after it was sighted by the officers, the object took off at high speed, leaving almost none of its trail. A police apparatus, and shortly disappeared. Local newsmen (San Bernardino) reporters received another similar report. Newsmen before Cochran and Branson reported their experience, from a resident at Del Rosa.
