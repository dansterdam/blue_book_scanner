1 December 1959
Oakland-Fremont area, Calif.

At about 3:15 a.m. on December 1, 1959, a bright light was seen to pass over the Oakland-Fremont area of California. The light was first seen by two watchers at the Oakland Airport control tower. They reported that the object appeared to be traveling at a very high speed and that it suddenly exploded into a white light, which then extinguished. The witnesses could not determine what the object was or where it came from. They described it as a fantastic speed and exploded into a white light which then went out. The true nature of the incident has not been clearly established.

CANADA, CONNECTICUT

LAST NIGHT A ROUND OBJECT WAS OBSERVED - A BRIGHT LIGHT, ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE DIAMETER OF THE FULL MOON, WHICH TRAVELLED AT VARIOUS SPEEDS AND ALTITUDES. IT APPEARED TO HAVE A TRAILING YELLOW LIGHT BEHIND IT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES AND THEN APPEARED TO DESCEND BEHIND SOME TREES. IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF A BALLOON, BUT INCREASED SPEED AND ALTERED COURSE AT TIMES IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH A BALLOON. WHEN IT LANDED, IT DISAPPEARED. THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE HAS HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH AIRCRAFT AND BALLOONS AND IS CONVINCED THIS WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR BALLOON.

THE OBJECT APPEARED ROUND AND WAS HIGHLY REFLECTIVE, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE EDGES. IT APPEARED TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT TIMES AND THEN WOULD ABRUPTLY CHANGE DIRECTION. ITS SPEED VARIED FROM VERY SLOW TO EXTREMELY FAST. THE WITNESS HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FLIGHT OR WHAT IT WAS, BUT DISCLAIMED ANY INNER KNOWLEDGE OR SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SIGHTING.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a typed report describing an observed unidentified flying object (UFO) incident that occurred near Willoughby, Ohio on December 19, 1963. The report states that two women, who were housewives, observed a fast-moving object in the sky that resembled a "ship-like object" with an orange-like trail. The object was observed for several minutes before it disappeared, leaving behind an orange-like flame trail.

The object was said to be going at a very high rate of speed and looked like a "cigar or missile-shaped object" with an orange-colored trail or exhaust. The women said they noticed the object at about 6:15 pm and it was in sight for several minutes. It then disappeared, leaving a trail of orange-like flame.

OAKDALE, CALIFORNIA

The text in the document is as follows:

ANONYMOUS OBJECT OBSERVED IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
On 22 Dec 59, at Oakdale, Calif., Mrs Kenneth Lindsley, age 33, of Oakdale, Calif., was walking in the vicinity of Claral Road and saw an object coming down out of the sky. She estimated the object to be 200 feet above the ground. As she first saw it, it looked was bright orange. At this the object it might have been several inches in diameter. It moved in a straight line and appeared to gently float down until it was only 20 feet above the ground, when it stopped and hovered. It remained there for about 2 minutes, then went back up into the air. Mrs Lindsley said the object rose rapidly and "like a shot" went back up out of sight.

Mrs Lindsley stated it made no noise and did not use any propulsion method that she could see. She said the object was just silent and floated effortlessly up and down. The object was in view for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Mrs Lindsley stated the object was about 20 feet in diameter and was circular in shape. She said it had a central area that looked metallic, and the outer edges seemed to be of a light transparent material.

The report stated that when the object first came down, it was bright orange in color, but as it hovered, the color changed to a very dull gray. The report also mentioned that when the object went back up, it did so rapidly and quietly up into the air, where it simply disappeared. 

Mrs Lindsley told a news reporter that "it appeared to be something from another world" and that she could not distinguish any windows or view inside the object. After the object went up and disappeared, she waited around the area for a while but saw nothing further.

MEMO, AFOIN-4-859, 29 DEC 59, SUBJ: UFO SIGHTING

1. An evaluation of this report indicates that the UFO is probably a balloon sighted in the basic report.

2. An analysis of the winds aloft, track direction and distance covered indicates that it is sighting is in her Roswell, NM, area and that the order of ground speed is compatible with a balloon track. This area or sighting is in the Roswell, NM, area and is considerable activity using balloons, in conjunction with various test programs.

3. No further substantiates this report, except that it is consistent with the Air Development Command analysis that the radar return is comparable to an aircraft return.

The image contains a photograph of a star chart showing the constellation Orion. The text in the image discusses the visibility of the Orion constellation and its observable features, such as the interesting "eclipsing variable" star Algol.

ORION VISIBLE
Finest of our bright first magnitude stars is seen in the sky nightly. Also observable is the interesting double "eclipsing variable" star, Algol, in the constellation of Perseus.
BY JAMES STOKLEY
NO NAKED-EYE planets appear in the evening sky during January, although the Zodiac signs indicate that Jupiter is well placed in the west, but its low position is not very noticeable. The display of the stars, however, is fine.
The stars are shown on the accompanying chart, which is drawn to represent the sky as it appears at about 9 p.m. During the month they will appear in somewhat different positions at various hours, but the relative positions of the constellations shown will be maintained. Orion, which stands in the southeast, dominates the scene, and you can hardly mistake it.
Above and to the left of the belt you see the corresponding nebulosity, called the Orion Nebula. It appears as a hazy patch to the naked eye, but a telescope will reveal it as a magnificent star-forming region.
To the right of the belt you see the variable star Algol, which is called the "Demon" star. It shows changes in brightness from the normal second magnitude to about the fourth magnitude in the course of about 2 1/2 days.

FONTANA, CALIFORNIA

POLICE SPOT SAUCER
Los Angeles, Calif. 1 December 1959 - While on regular patrol, Officer W. H. Chesnover of the Fontana Police Department observed a large, round object which was hovering and emitting a periodic flashing light from the area of Almond Grove, Fontana, California, at 9:32 p.m.

Officer Chesnover watched the object for approximately 20 minutes, during which time it performed several maneuvers, including a rapid ascent, a descent, and hovering at various altitudes. The object appeared to be illuminated and was observed to be approximately 30 feet in diameter. It finally disappeared in the distance.

A few minutes after Officer Chesnover lost sight of the object, two other officers of the Fontana Police Department, Officers A. E. Duran and J. E. Daniels, also observed the object for a short period of time before it disappeared. Officer Chesnover reported the incident to his superiors and was instructed to submit a written report on the matter. The report was forwarded to the United States Air Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for further investigation.
