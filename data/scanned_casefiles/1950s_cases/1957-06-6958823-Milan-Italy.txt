Milan, June 14, 1957

Messrs.
U.F.O.,
Unidentified Flying Objects,
Washington 25, D.C.,
U.S.A.

Via Air Mail

Gentlemen:

I think it is my duty to inform you that on June 12,1957 here in Milan, Italy, at 19:30 (Central European Time) I was scanning the sky through my Field Glasses to follow the course of the last low fast sailing clouds over the city after a heavy storm with strong wind (7/8 Beaufort's scale) and hail rain.

The section of sky I was looking included the West, North and East parts. The East part in particular was exceptionally clear. Suddenly a bright point coming from East and go-ing westward appeared through the field glasses.

This point followed a zigzag path at high speed for a few seconds, lowered over the city, became as big as a hen's egg and then stopped. The estimate altitude was 5,000 feet. I noted the time on my wrist watch: it was 19:41.

The unidentified object was very bright (green-yellow in color) and apparently revolving upon its axis. 17 minutes later it swayed toward the upper atmosphere leaving two white-orange trails of vapor and disappeared.

I am sure that this information will be of some help for your office. Should you need further explanations on this matter I shall be glad to be at your disposal in replying to your questionnaires, questions, etc.

For your guidance I inform you that I did not tell anybody about this discovery and I address this letter to your office in Washington because I know it is the only one interested in the U.F.O. problem.
