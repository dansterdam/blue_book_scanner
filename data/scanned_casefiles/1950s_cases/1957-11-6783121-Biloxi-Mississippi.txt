1. Enclosed are the photographs and sketches referenced in our message 082234, 6 November 1957. An explanation of each follows:
a. Enclosure #1: Photographs and negatives. These were taken of the object by the witness 30 seconds apart without moving the camera. Object is indicated by arrow.
b. Enclosure #2: Photograph and negative. This is a six-minute time exposure of the object taken by witness. Object is indicated by arrow. Also shown (key shows flight direction) are contrails of high speed object track and turn.
c. Enclosure #3: Sketches shown the object as being round and tapared in the direction shown. The object and contrails were produced by observer (witness) as he watched the object disappear into distance.
d. Enclosure #4: Sketches show the object starting to change shape (as evidenced by "slight spiral" drawn around it).
e. Enclosure #5: Sketches show the object still round and the "slight spiral" dimishing to straight line.
f. Enclosure #6: Sketches show the round object with a flat top (as witness thought he saw the object do a half flip). Sketches are the witness's conception of what the object looked like when it had changed from round to what is described for the first two sightings.
PLEASE ADDRESS ANY REPLY AND ENVELOPE AS REQUESTED ABOVE - NOT TO AN INDIVIDUAL BY NAME.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a Project Blue Book disposition form, titled "DISPOSITION FORM". The document discusses a UFOB (Unidentified Flying Object) report and mentions that the lack of data in the report prevents any photo analysis. The form is signed by Robert J. Ruicholstor, Major, USAF, AFOTN-4a2f.

Text extracted from the image:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILL NO.:               SUBJECT: UFOB Report
TO: AFOTN-4a2f          FROM: AFOTN-4a2f        DATE: 6 DEC 57   COMMENT NO.: 1
Lack of data in this report prevents any photo analysis except that prints
were made from negatives that are present and that the streak and date on negative
are lost from the exposure. Unless (indistinct) could have been made on prints
they are of no value because of the very slight exposures.
