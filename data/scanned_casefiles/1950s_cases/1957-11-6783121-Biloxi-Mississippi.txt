The only text I can see in this image is "4 11 told" in the top right corner of the document. The rest of the image appears to be a black and white abstract or blurred photographic image with curved lines and varying shades of gray and white.


- page 2 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white sketch or drawing with curved, sweeping lines and varying shades of gray, creating an abstract or atmospheric effect. The image looks like it might be a drawing of a curved surface or landscape with textured, flowing lines.


- page 3 -

Text found in the image:

"Body circle"
"Object"

At the bottom left: "Incl 3"

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of two concentric oval shapes, with the text "Body circle" and "Object" written within the ovals.

Text found in the image:

"object"
"light circle"
"direct"
"Dist #5"

The image appears to be a hand-drawn oval or elliptical shape with multiple concentric lines, with handwritten annotations around and within the drawing.

Text found in the image:

Top left: "to Halion"
Top right: "#1"

Inside the drawn oval:
"Cipiest"

Bottom left of oval: "Incil #6"

Bottom right of oval: "the light Circle"

The image appears to be a hand-drawn oval or circular sketch with various handwritten annotations.

The text I can discern on this document is:

No doc
blew lens
etc.

The rest of the text is illegible due to the poor quality and low contrast of the black and white image. The image appears to show a document or photograph with some markings or lines, but the details are not clear.

Here is the text I can discern from the image:

There is an arrow pointing upward on the left side of the document. The text appears to be handwritten and somewhat difficult to read with complete certainty.

MEMO ROUTING SLIP

To: Major Buckmaster
Organization and Location: ACIN-4A 2F

Remarks:
1. This sent in directly by HQ's 4 DC, appears to be Venus, exaggerated call out of proportion by the (word unclear) artists great imagination.

2. Prints at first glance seem time-lapse of the moon on snow similar to headlines that (unclear word) can create. It appears that the white inside is not a multiple print - that was no photograph.

3. Your examination and comments would be appreciated by the Air Science Div.

HEADQUARTERS

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: Commander

Colorado Springs, Colorado

1. Enclosed are the photographs and sketches referenced in our message, O5252, 15 November 1957. An explanation of each follows:

a. Inclosure #1; photograph and negative: Two exposures were taken of the object by the witness 30 seconds apart without moving the camera. Object is indicated by arrow.

b. Inclosure #2; photograph and negative: This is a six-minute time exposure of this object taken by witness. Object is indicated by arrow #1. Reflection of object on water is also shown (by arrow #2). Light scratches around object track and star track were caused by pan marks on negative.

c. Inclosure #3; sketch: Shows the object as being round. The area shown as "light circle" was not as bright as the object, and traced in the direction shown. (All sketches were produced by another witness who was the mother of the witness who photographed the object.)

d. Inclosure #4; sketch: Shows the object starting to change shape (as evidenced by the "light circle" drawn around it).

e. Inclosure #5; sketch: Shows the object still round and the "light circle" similar to sketch #1.

f. Inclosure #6; sketch: Shows the round object with a flat top with the "light circle" having changed its position to the bottom half.

g. Inclosure #7; drawing: This is the artist's conception of what the object looked like when it had changed from round to the flat top position. Colors used to indicate the object were silver for the intense light, silver-grey for the light circle and black for the sky.

PLEASE ADDRESS ANY REPLY AND ENVELOPE AS REQUESTED ABOVE - NOT TO AN INDIVIDUAL BY NAME.

2. No other reports on this object were received at this headquarters. A New Orleans, Louisiana, newspaper covered a small column about a bright object sighted in this general area and identified it as the Planet Venus. This investigation also feels that this is a plausible explanation of the sighting reported upon.

DISPOSITION FORM

FILE NO.                  SUBJECT
TO    AFCIN-4AE           FROM    AFCIN-4A2F           DATE    6 Dec 57    COMMENT NO. 1

Lack of data in this report prevents any photo analysis except that prints were made from negatives that are present and that the streak and data on negative are actual exposures. These exposures could have been made in many ways; therefore, there is no way to positively prove anything except that there are exposures.
