UNITED PRESS STAFF CORRESPONDENT
WASHINGTON, OCT. -- (UP) --A VETERAN AIRLINE PILOT WHO ONCE
DENOUNCED FLYING SAUCERS, AS "BUNK" HAS REPORTED ENCOUNTERING A
MYSTERIOUS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT NEAR MOBILE, ALA.
    CAPT. W. H. HULL, OF CAPITAL AIRLINES DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT IN A
REPORT PUBLISHED BY "THE UFO INVESTIGATOR," MAGAZINE OF THE UNOFFICIAL
NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA.
    HULL WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR A PILOTS MAGAZINE IN 1955 TITLED "THE
OBITUARY OF THE FLYING SAUCER." HIS EXPERIENCE DESCRIBED IN THE
"INVESTIGATOR"

"INVESTIGATOR" TOOK PLACE NOV. 14, 1956. HE DID NOT
SUGGEST THAT HE SAW WHAT HE WAS FLYING A SAUCER.
HULL SAID HE WAS FLYING A VISCOUNT AT ABOUT 10,000 FEET NEAR
MOBILE, AT 10:10 P.M., WHEN HE AND HIS CO-PILOT SPOTTED "WHAT WE
THOUGHT WAS A BRILLIANT METEOR."
HE SAID THE "METEOR" WAS DESCENDING RAPIDLY, BUT INSTEAD OF BURNING
OUT WITH THE USUAL FLASH, "IT ABRUPTLY HALTED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US."
    "IT WAS AN INTENSE BLUE-WHITE LIGHT, APPROXIMATELY SEVEN OR EIGHT
TIMES AS BRIGHT AS VENUS WHEN THIS PLANET IS AT ITS BRIGHTEST
MAGNITUDE," HULL WROTE.
    HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE OBJECT MIGHT BE A JET FIGHTER, TURNING
AWAY FROM THE AIRLINER AND GIVING THE PILOTS A VIEW OF ITS GLOWING
TAILPIPE.  BUT HE SAID INSTEAD OF GROWING SMALLER, THE LIGHT REMAINED
IN FRONT OF THE VISCOUNT."
    HULL WROTE THAT THE "UFO" (UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT) THEN
BEGAN A SERIES OF VIOLENT MANEUVERS, SHARPER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT,
SOMETIMES CHANGING DIRECTION SO QUICKLY IN AN INSTANT." IT FINALLY
ZOOMED UP AT AN EXTREMELY SHARP ANGLE AND SHOT OUT OF SIGHT, HULL
ADDED.
    "HE SAID HIS OWN PLANE WAS ABOVE THE CLOUDS, "PRECLUDING ANY
REFLECTIONS OF SEARCHLIGHTS FROM BELOW."
    "I HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF ADVERTISING SEARCHLIGHTS PLAYING ON CLOUDS,
AND THIS WAS NOTHING REMOTELY RELATED," HULL WROTE.
    "LIKEWISE I AM RULING OUT AIRCRAFT (AT LEAST THE ONES WE KNOW),
BALLOONS, MISSILES OR ANY OTHER EARTH-LAUNCHED DEVICE WITHIN MY
KNOWLEDGE. THIS IS THE ONLY FACT I CAN GIVE THAT WHEN I CAME, WHEN I
IT CAME STEEPLY DOWNWARD AND WHEN IT DEPARTED AFTER ITS AMAZING SHOW,
IT WENT STEEPLY UPWARD."

UFO Encounter Convinces Airline Captain, Former Skeptic

A two-minute encounter with a UFO, which quickly changed a skeptic to a believer, was vividly recalled by Captain W. J. Hull, veteran pilot for Capital Airlines. A or no his experience, which occurs on his airliner neared Mobile, Alabama, Captain Hull was widely known among pilots for his negative views on flying saucers.

In a special article for THE AIRLINE PILOT entitled "The Ordinary of the Flying Saucer" Hull accepted Dr. Donald Menzel's natural phenomena explanation for the UFO's. Later he agreed to no examination of the evidence, but his dramatic report was the first hint that he had accepted the UFO's as machines of an unknown type.

For over six months Captain Hull withheld the facts from publication, then he released the story to Civilian Saucer Intelligence, New York, of which he is a member. It is printed here by special permission of CSI.

On the night of November 14, 1956, Captain Hull was flying a Viscount four-engine turboprop airliner from New York to Mobile, over a layer of occasionally broken cloud which enabled him to get a look at the ground only occasionally.

"At 10:10 p.m. EST," notes Capt. Hull, "we were only about 60 miles from Mobile when my co-pilot, Bates Tower, and I saw what we thought was a brilliant meteor. We were flying southwest and it fell across our path from left to right, first becoming visible at the top of the windshield. The Viscount has wonderful visibility upward.

"It decelerated rapidly, just as any meteor does when entering the denser layers of the earth's lower atmosphere. We expected to see it burn out with the customary flash which pilots often see, but it obviously held directly in front of us!"

EXTRACT
VOL. 4, NO. 20                CAPITAL AIRLINES' PILOTS SEE ACROBATIC NIGHT LIGHT                JULY 1957

(The sighting which follows is of particular interest because it was made by
an expert observer - a veteran airline pilot - who was formerly extremely skeptical
on the subject of flying saucers. In fact, in 1953 Captain [ILLEGIBLE] wrote an article
for Airline Pilot magazine titled "The Obituary of the Flying Saucers." We reprint,
with his permission, a slightly condensed excerpt from the letter to CSI President
in which he described his experience.)

On the night of November 14, 1956 I was flying a Viscount at high altitude
from New York to Mobile, Alabama. We were above a layer of clouds which were occasionally broken, giving us a glimpse of the ground now and then. At 10:10 p.m.
E.S.T., when only about 60 miles from Mobile, my co-pilot and I saw
what we thought was a brilliant meteor. We were flying south-southwest and it fell
across our path from left to right, first becoming visible at the top of the windshield. (The Viscount has wonderful visibility upward.) It decelerated rapidly,
just as any meteor does when entering the denser layers of the earth's lower atmosphere, and we expected to see it burn out with the customary flash, which pilots
often see, but which people on the ground are often denied.

Imagine our consternation when this brilliant light did not burn out, but
abruptly halted directly in front of us! It was an intense blue-white light, approximately 7 or 8 times as bright as Venus when this planet is at its brightest
magnitude. I thought "What the hell is it, a jet?" His first thought, of course,
was that the object was a diving jet fighter which had turned sharply away from us
and in departing, was giving us a view right up its glowing tailpipe. Instantly I
knew this could not possibly be an airplane. I have seen the glow of too many jet
pipes at night not to recognize one when I see it. It was not the right color; and it
did not diminish in size, as a departing jet fighter's exhaust should have; and it
remained motionless directly ahead of us, how far I cannot say, but it must have
been quite a few miles.

I quickly grabbed my microphone and called the Mobile Control Tower. "Bates
Tower, this is Capital 77! Look out toward the north and east and see if you can
see a strange white light hovering in the sky."

"Capital 77, this is Mobile Bates Tower. We are unable to see much of the
sky because of a thick cloud cover. Do you think the object is in our vicinity?"

"Affirmative. It looks like a brilliant white light bulb, about one tenth
the size of the moon. It is directly ahead of us and at about our altitude, or
slightly higher. We are right over Jackson, Alabama and have descended to 10,000
feet. Please initiate a call to Brookley Field Tower (Air Force Field 20 miles
southeast of Bates Field) and ask the controller if he can see it on their big radar scope." (We did not have the military frequency crystals in our transmitter
to work Brookley Tower.)

Just after this exchange, the object began to maneuver. It darted hither and
yon, rising and falling in undulating flight, making sharper turns than any known
aircraft, sometimes changing direction 90 degrees in an instant. All the while the
color remained constant, a brilliant blue-white, and the object did not grow or lessen in size. I sat there completely flabbergasted at this unnerving
exhibition. I thought of calling the passengers over the public address system, but
the object was dead ahead of us and putting on its performance in an area whose arc
was not large enough to enable anybody in the cabin to get a view of it out the side
windows. After a half minute or so of this darting, unorthodox flight the object
suddenly became motionless again and hovered dead still. We were simply confounded

by this.

Bates Tower called back, "Capital 77, we are trying to raise the Brooklyn Tower."

Right at this moment the strange light began another series of crazy gyrations, lazy 8's, square chandelles, all the while weaving through the air with a sort of rhythm, undulating cadence, the likes of which neither nor I had ever seen. Then, apparently content at the consternation which it had wrought, the object shot out over the Gulf of Mexico, rising at the most breathtaking angle and at such a fantastic speed that it diminished rapidly to a pinpoint and was swallowed up in the night.

This unearthly exhibition probably went on for at least two minutes, according to our best judgment. I glanced at the clock and noted it read 1051:12.

The most puzzling thing about the whole occurrence, aside from the dancing flight, was that the object, whatever it was, had remained at the same distance from us throughout the performance. How do we know this? It never increased in size, and yet we were bearing down on it at more than 5 miles a minute in the Viscount. If it was in view two miles and performing in one area we should have been at least ten miles closer to it. Now, any object that flies certainly looks different when viewed at such a great variance in distance. So this UFO must have managed to remain at the same distance from us throughout the entire display.

If you know southern Alabama you know that it is pretty desolate country, with few inhabitants and only a few small hamlets between Mobile and Montgomery up in the middle of the state. We were above the clouds, precluding any reflections or searchlights from below. I have seen hundreds of advertising searchlights on clouds, and this was remotely related. Likewise I am summarily ruling out aircraft (at least the ones we know), balloons, missiles, or any other earth-launched device within my ken. The one thing which I can't get over is the fact that when it came, it came steeply downward. Now I ask you, [ILLEGIBLE] is this machine based on the earth?

I followed up on this spectacular sighting after landing at Mobile. The control tower operators had reached Brooklyn after a slight delay, but the controller had seen nothing, and since no night flights were in progress, the surveillance radar had not been energized at the time.

In case any of your members would like to know my background, you may give it to them. You will remember me as objectively skeptical and cynically critical of most of the purported saucer sightings. But I think you have to believe a veteran airline pilot with 17 years of service, 15,000 hours and 3 million miles in his logbook. I am seeking no publicity. I didn't report this sighting to the press and not a word has ever been printed about it until this moment.

SIGHTING REPORTS

November 16, 1956, CSI has received a confirmation of the observation by Miss [ILLEGIBLE] of New Rochelle, that was reported in News Letter # 6 (p. 22). The confirmation comes from Mrs. [ILLEGIBLE] who also confirms walking near an inlet of Echo Bay, shortly after 10 p.m. that night, a luminous ball with a little flame-like tail emerged from behind trees in the object, and moved slowly on a southwesterly course toward New York City. The object, apparently moving over Long Island Sound, was in view for about 30 secs. Object appeared, traveling over exactly the same route a second half the apparent size of the full moon, and was quite low. Each object was about leading edge was nearly defined, the near edge fuzzy, with a tail. The objects noted had the impression that the two objects were fairly low on the horizon. Mrs. Rey- [ILLEGIBLE] watched until about 10:30 p.m., and moving over the Sound in the same direction. Undoubtedly these are the same ob- jects in the directions reported by Mrs. [ILLEGIBLE], even though there is a slight discrepancy in the two directions reported (this [ILLEGIBLE] thought that they traveled from east to west). (Compare Beirut Parade, [ILLEGIBLE], pp. 12-27.)

Case 271, Dyersburg and adjacent communities, Tenn., Nov. 18, 1957-CAP reported that an unidentified object high over Northwest Tennessee caused considerable excitement. Ernest Stanley, CAA official, said the object was probably a giant balloon. Hundreds of area residents watched the object for more than an hour. It was reported seen from Gleason, Union City and Reelfoot Lake. Stanley estimated the height at 75,000 feet!

Case 576 Dallas Texas, Nov. 24, 1956-Unold told the following News from Terrell, 60 miles east of Dallas: Two were again over a brilliant fiery meteor they thought was headed for them. Two were then with our group and declared J. L. John St. looked like he was going to hit right in the middle of the field. The phenomenon was first sighted about 6:18 a.m. by Ray Parr who described it as a "big ball of fire" which he was sighted at a position about 45° up in the sky, fell at an angle of about 20° and disappeared due south of Love Field about 10° above the horizon. There was a sort of halo around the leading edge of the main ball. Described as shooting off the tail. The color of the tail was completely dark. And an either side of it flames of blue, yellow and green. The streamer back of the meteor streamed towards the earth.

Quest Monnig, meteor expert, tried to trace the meteorite. He said, "The one seen from Love Field must have been a big fellow with light for at least 15 seconds." Monnig led one report from a motorist on the road between Texas and Greenview. I called control tower at Bryan, Austin and San Antonio and none had observed the meteor. Monnig said that meteors have a way of dropping into brightly settled land or water and leave no trace."

Case 272, Dallas, Texas, Nov. 24, 1956 -Said the Dallas Morning News]: "Personnel at the Love Field control tower were quick over a brilliant fiery meteor they thought was headed for them. 'We sat there with our mouths open' declared J. J. Jobe. 'It looked like it was going to hit right in the middle of the field.' The phenomenon was first sighted about 6:18 a.m. by Ray Pharr who described it as 'big as the moon.' Jobe said it was sighted a position about 450 up in the sky, fell at an angle of about 200 and disappeared due south of Love Field about 100 above the horizon. 'There was a sort of halo around the leading edge of the main ball.' described Jobe, 'with long sparks showing off the tail.' The center of the tail was completely dark and on either side of it flames of blue, white and green fire streamed back as the meteor streaked towards the earth.'"

Oscar Monnig, meteor expert, tried to track down the meteorite. He said, "The one seen from Love Field must have been a big fellow with light for at least 5 seconds. It was just an optical illusion that the thing seemed to fall on Dallas. I'd say that its end point was at least 150 miles south. Monnig had one report from a motorist on the road between Itasca and Grandview. I called control towers at Bryan, Austin and San Antonio and none had observed the meteor." Monnig said that meteors have a way of dropping into lightly settled land or wilderness as if some intelligence were guiding them to secret landings.

Case 276, Cincinnati, Ohio, Nov. 30, 1956—Letting out
a sick dog at 5:55 am, Mrs. L saw a strange, large and
brilliant light to her east. Dumbfounded, she watched it
move slowly to a point about midway from her home
and a lodge about 400 feet distance, then it stopped. In
the early morning gloom, Mrs. L said the object, round
and glowing a soft dull olive green, stood out against the
lodge's 50 feet high chimney. Mrs. L. estimates that the
size of the lodge was 30 x 40 feet and noted that the
object completely covered its view from her vantage
point. Making no sound, Mrs. L. said the object soon
started to move up and while doing so, turned red.

It disappeared behind some trees on a ridge nearby.
Mrs. L. called her husband, but he arrived on the scene
too late for a good look, but did see a light receding into
the sky. The Weather Bureau was phoned, but they had
no explanation for the phenomenon.

Case 275, Petersburg, Indiana, Nov. 30, 1956—From a mass of UFO reports sent to CRIFO by Frank Edwards, WTTV, Indianapolis, we quote from one as follows:

"Charles Malott, aged 17 in an employee at Pete's Drive In, Petersburg, Thursday at noon, young Malott drove his truck three miles south, on State Highway 61 to give the truck a test after he had worked on it. He turned at the top of Half Mile Hill and was driving to Petersburg and had gone only a half mile when he heard a noise at the rear of his truck, likened to 'three old time' thrashing machines' all operating at the same time. He drove off to the side of the highway and discovered that the noise was emitting from something that was slowly taking to the air from behind a woods about 1,000 yards southeast of the state highway. The object soon became visible and was spherical in shape, void of wings, had a diameter of about 16 feet and a height of 6 to 7 feet. After attaining a height of about 150 feet, the strange object ceased to make any sound and took off in a northeasterly direction traveling at great speed, and attaining altitude until he lost sight of it. Malott is a mechanic, and has been around airplanes and helicopters. He declares that what he saw was different from anything he ever saw, or heard about. The object did not appear to have any windows, nor was it equipped with a tail. It arose vertically as though being pushed upward off the ground by some hidden giant propellor. He saw no landing gears attached to the object. He was surprised when it arose 150 feet that all noise ceased."
