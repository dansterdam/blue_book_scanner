1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Here are the comments on the recent batch of material. A few cases are certainly of considerable interest. Over all, in this batch, Venus counts for only one: 28 January, Stuttgart. Fireballs most probably account for 4 cases; balloons for four and aircraft for three.

Coming to the interesting cases: the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This comes very close to being a security-intelligence matter. I'd certainly like to get more information on this. How about sending a Form A to Korea. Actually, this should have been investigated on the spot by Intelligence officers.

Pepperdill AFB 2 May: This has some similarities to the old Gorman case. Much fuller report needed and Form A filed out on this.

San Antonio 7 May: This has many similarities to the Lubbock Lights and Form A should certainly be sent. If this has not already been done.

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting would help.

The Miami 20 May Green light sighting might have been jets but with the green light sightings, jets should have been traveling north instead of south in order for observer to see green navigation lights. 2 second time interval also seems too fast. I hope that you can eventually send me more information on these: 20 April Korea; 2 May Pepperdill; 7 May San Antonio.

I am enclosing my version of a report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur.

And keep 'em coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently than a larger batch at longer intervals.

Jennie send her regards.
