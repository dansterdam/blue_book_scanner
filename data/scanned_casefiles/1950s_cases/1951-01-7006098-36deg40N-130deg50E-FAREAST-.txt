SUBJECT: Radar Detection of Airborne Targets Making Passes on Guadalupe (AD-32)
REF: Naval Dispatch NC-2611102 and Nr. 2501352 from COMFAIRWING 5 to COMPAIR JAP

1. The following information is requested concerning radar detection of airborne targets making passes on Guadalupe (AD-32): 
(a) What type radar detected the targets?
(b) Frequency of radar.
(c) Pulse width.
(d) Type modulator (hard tube, spark gap).
(e) Altitude of aircraft when targets were detected.
(f) Were target blips steady while observed or were they spotty and of unequal amplitude?
(g) What is meant by radar blips elongating to 3/8 inch and 1/8 inch? Is this elongation in range or azimuth?
(h) How did the target size compare in range and azimuth with that of conventional aircraft?
(i) Were any radar sets operational on the Guadalupe and what were their target status during the time the airborne radar detected targets?
(j) Is there any other information that can be added to this report?

ORAP Item 2, TT-023-AIR, 15 MARCH 51 

   It is suggested that substantially the following action be taken to the subject:

"Information contained in ORAP Item 2, TT-023-AIR, 15 MARCH 51 indicates that the unknown object referred therein reported having been observed under conditions towards 0-3000 at a very high rate, than actually the maximum speed observed was actually condition conditions may appear. It is suggested that this material be referred to for any comparative conditions in the possible event actual observations come to light and that this would not necessarily be typical of unusual cases handled under conditions as outlined above.

"Any more details regarding the subject matter, observations, etc. this office would appreciate receiving a copy thereof for inclusion in pertinent project files."

REFERENCE RADNOTS 1951-1-7006098: EVALUATION
OF UNKNOWN AIRCRAFT OR TARGETS REPORTED WITHOUT
COMPLETE DATA AVAILABLE.

REFERENCE: RADNOTS 1951-1-7006098. THIS IS AN EVALUATION
OF UNKNOWN AIRCRAFT OR TARGETS REPORTED WITHOUT
COMPLETE DATA AVAILABLE.

IN THE COMPLETE REPORT WHICH YOUR RADNOTS INDICATES
CONTAINS THE OBSERVATIONS OF RADAR TARGETS, POSSIBLY COULD
INDICATE THAT THE RADAR TARGETS POSSIBLY COULD
HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA.

(1) INTERFERENCE FROM THE DETECTING RADAR
SET. (2) ECHANI SM AND LEAKAGE, AND LEAST LIKELY
(3) AIRBORNE TARGET OR TARGETS OF UNKNOWN
ORIGIN.

EVERY CONSIDERATION REQUIRED FOR CAREFUL
EVALUATION INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:

1. WHAT TYPES RADAR DETECTED THE TARGETS.
2. FREQUENCY OF RADAR. PULSE RATE.
3. MODULATION (GAIN) USED. (TIME CONSTANT)
4. ALTITUDE OF AIRCRAFT WHEN TARGETS STEADY
WERE OBSERVED OR WHEN THEY WERE UNSTEADY
OF UNEQUAL AMPLITUDE. TO WHAT IS MEANT BY
THIS IS THE ELONGATION IN RANGE OR AZIMUTH.
5. SIZE AND ELEVATION CORRESPONDING TARGETS.
6. NUMBER AND LOCATION OF THE TARGETS DETECTED
AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS.

RADAR THE TARGETS SEEN BY MORE THAN
ONE AIRBORNE RADAR. TO WERE ANY RADAR SETS
OPERATING ON THE GROUNDALLUDES AND WHAT WERE
THEIR TARGETS.

REGULAR RADAR DETECTS ON TRANSIENT TARGETS DETECTED
DURING THE TIME OF DETECTION OF UNKNOWN 
TARGETS. IF THERE ANY OTHER AIRBORNE
AIRCRAFT DURING THE RUNS OF DETECTION
OF UNKNOWN TARGETS AND THEY HAVE RADAR
ONBOARD, IT SHOULD BE DETERMINED IF THEY 
HAD SIMILAR TRACKS OR TARGETS. OTHER
INFORMATION THAT CAN BE ADDED TO THIS REPORT.

IT SHOULD BE REALIZED THAT EVALUATION
OF VERY SCANT AND OFTEN HASTILY PREPARED
GROUND OBSERVATIONS OF RADAR PHENOMENA
CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED BY PERSONAL INTERROGATION
OF THE PERSONNEL OPERATING THE RADAR SET INVOLVED.
