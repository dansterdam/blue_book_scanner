"I think he realized that evaluation of very sketchy and often misinterpreted radar target data is very difficult and can best be analyzed by personnel interrogation by an analyst of the personnel operating the radar set involved."

SUBJECT: Radar Detection of Airborne Targets Making Passes on Guadalupe (AO-52)

Ref: (a) Naval Messages No. 281102 and No. 280135Z from COMPATRIWING 6 to COMPAIR JAP

1. The following information is requested concerning radar detection of airborne targets making passes on Guadalupe (AO-52), in order that this headquarters can make an analysis of the type target sighted:

(a) What type radar detected the targets?

(b) Frequency of radar.

(c) Pulse width.

(d) Type modulator (hard tube, spark gap).

(e) Altitude of aircraft when targets were detected.

(f) Were target blips steady while observed or were they spotty and of unequal amplitude?

(g) What is meant by radar blips elongating to 3/8 inch and 1/8 inch? Is this elongation in range or azimuth?

(h) How did the target size compare in range and azimuth with that of conventional aircraft?

(i) Were any radar sets operational on the Guadalupes and what were their target status during the time the airborne radar detected targets?

(j) Is there any other information that can be added to this report?

CSAF Item 2, TW-01-AL, 15 March 51
From: NOIA
To: NCMAA-1
Attn: Dr. Rodgers

It is suggested that substantially the following reply be made to the subject message:

"Information contained in CSAF Item 2, TW-01-AL, 15 March 51 indicates that the unknown radar targets reported therein possibly were due to abnormal weather conditions.

"Previous reports have indicated that abnormal weather conditions may cause targets to appear to move at a very high rate, when actually the movement is due to several weather targets which are caused by changing weather conditions in the same general area. These weather targets are normally not as sharp, fast, or distinct, etc. targets. An indication of this is contained in the subject message as follows: "Signal elongated to about 3/5 inch."

"IF more details regarding the subject radar observations become available, this office would appreciate receiving a copy thereof for inclusion in pertinent project file."

FROM J J RODGERS MCIAXO-A
TO TCJ

INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CSAF ITEM 2,
TT-091-A, 15 MAR 51, INDICATES THAT THE
UNKNOWN RADAR TARGETS REPORTED THEREIN
POSSIBLY WERE DUE TO ABNORMAL WEATHER
CONDITIONS

PREVIOUS REPORTS HAVE INDICATED THAT
ABNORMAL WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE
TARGETS TO APPEAR TO MOVE AT A VERY HIGH
RATE WHEN ACTUALLY THE MOVEMENT IS DUE
TO SEVERAL WEATHER TARGETS WHICH ARE CAUSED
BY CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE SAME
GENERAL AREA. THESE WEATHER TARGETS ARE USUALLY NOT
AS SHARPLY DEFINED AS AIRCRAFT, SHIP, ETC.

TO MORE DETAILS REGARDING THE SUBJECT
RADAR OBSERVATIONS BECOME AVAILABLE,
THIS OFFICE WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING A COPY

ITEM 5 AMC

FROM J ROGERS MCILKA-1A
TO AFOIN-W/IG ATTN COL HARRIS

UNCLASSIFIED

REFERENCE RADNOTE R515202. EVALUATION OF REFERENCE RADNOTE CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THIS MAY BE PROVIDED IN THE 'COMPLETE REPORT' WHICH YOUR RADNOTE CONTAINED WAS FORWARDING. PRESENT INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE RADAR TARGETS POSSIBLY COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
(1) INTERFERENCE FROM ANOTHER RADAR SET
(2) INTERFERENCE FROM THE DETECTING RADAR
(3) ITSELF (3) WEATHER AND LEAST LIKELY
(4) AIRBORNE TARGET OF UNKNOWN TYPE

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR EVALUATION INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:
1. WHAT TYPE RADAR DETECTED THE TARGETS.
2. FREQUENCY OF RADAR, 3. PULSE WIDTH.
4. TYPE MODULATION (HARD TUBE, SPARK GAP)
5. ALTITUDE OF AIRCRAFT WHEN TARGETS WERE DETECTED, 6. WERE TARGET BLIPS STEADY
WHILE OBSERVED OR WERE THEY SPORTY AND OF UNEQUAL AMPLITUDE, 7. WHAT IS MEANT BY RADAR BLIPS ELONGATING TO 3/8 INCH AND 1/2 INCH. 15 PHI ELONGATION IN RANGE OR AZIMUTH.
8. HOW DID THE TARGET SIZE COMPARE IN RANGE AND AZIMUTH WITH THAT OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT

9. WERE THE TARGETS SEEN BY MORE THAN ONE AIRBORNE RADAR, 10. WERE ANY RADAR SETS OPERATIONAL ON THE GUADALUPE AND WHAT WERE THEIR TARGET STATUS DURING THE TIME THE AIRBORNE RADAR DETECTED TARGETS. 11. WERE ANY OTHER AIRBORNE TARGETS DETECTED DURING THE TIME OF DETECTION OF UNKNOWN TARGETS. 12. WERE THERE ANY OTHER AIRBORNE AIRCRAFT DURING THE TIME OF DETECTION OF UNKNOWN TARGETS AND DID THEY HAVE RADAR EQUIPMENT IN OPERATION. 13. 15 THERE ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT CAN BE ADDED TO THIS REPORT.

IT SHOULD BE REALIZED THAT EVALUATION OF VERY SKETCHY AND OFTEN MISINTERPRETED RADAR TARGET DATA IS VERY DIFFICULT, AND CAN BEST BE ANALYZED BY PERSONAL INTERROGATION OF AN ANALYST OF THE PERSONNEL OPERATING THE RADAR SET INVOLVED.

SUBJECT: Analysis of Report Regarding Unknown Radar Targets

TO: NOIAXA-14                                 FROM: NOIAXA           DATE: 12 FEB 1951   COMMENT NO. 1
ATTN: Mr. Walters

1. It is suggested that the attached minute be answered substantially as follows:

"Reference RADCOT 9 051/202. Evaluation of referenced RADCOT cannot be accomplished without additional information. This was provided by your RADINT which indicates that the radar targets possibly could have been caused by one of the following: (1) interference from another radar; (2) interference from the detecting radar set itself; (3) weather; and least likely (4) airborne target or targets of unknown type."

Additional information required for evaluation includes the following:

1. What type radar detected the targets
2. Frequency of radar
3. Pulse width
4. Type modulator (hard tube, spark gap)
5. Altitude of aircraft when targets were detected
6. Were target blips steady-like observed or were they spotty and of unequal amplitude?
7. What is meant by radar blips elongating to 3/8 inch and 1/3 inch?
   Is this elongation in range or azimuth?
8. How did the target size compare in range and azimuth with that of conventional aircraft?
9. Were the targets seen by more than one airborne radar?
10. Were any radar sets operational on the GUADALUPE and what were their target status during the time the airborne radar detected targets?
11. Were any other airborne targets detected during the time of detection of unknown targets?
12. Were there any other airborne aircraft during the time of detection of unknown targets and all they were near equipment in operation?
