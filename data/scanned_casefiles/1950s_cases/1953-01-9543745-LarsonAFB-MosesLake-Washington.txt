Larson Air Force Base, Washington
5 January 1953

I. Description of Incident:
As 1515 Z over sixty varied military and civilian sources observed one green, disc-shaped object. The object appeared to be stationary for fifteen minutes during which time the object moved in a southeasterly direction while bobbing vertically and gaining in altitude. There was no sound. An 1545Z aircraft was scrambled but a thirty minute search of the area revealed nothing conclusive.

II. Discussion of Incident:
A check of adjacent radar sites revealed no unusual returns or activity in the area. The winds were generally from S30r W at 12,000 ft. Thus the object would appear to move against the wind since it must have been below 12,000 ft. There was no sir traffic reported in the area.

III. Conclusion:
Unknown.

The text describes the sighting of a green disk-shaped object, the size of a large weather balloon, that decreased in size until disappearing. The object was observed by at least 63 reliable witnesses, including personnel from a fighter interceptor squadron. No sound was heard, and the speed of the object was not observed. The object was seen at an altitude of about 12,000 feet, below a high cloud layer.

Air Intelligence Information Report
3-1 UNCLASSIFIED PAGE 3 OF 2 PAGES

On 3 January 1953 the sighting of an unidentified flying object was reported. The object was observed by several military personnel stationed at the Moses Lake Air Force Base in Washington. The object was observed for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes and was traveling at high speeds, making sudden stops, and changing direction at very short intervals. 

Descriptions of the object were varied, ranging from circular, rectangular, to cylindrical in shape. The object was estimated to be approximately 30 to 50 feet in length and 10 to 15 feet in width. The color was reported to be silver or metallic in appearance.

The majority of the observers were in the immediate vicinity on the base, but a small town 12 miles southwest of the base also had observers. All observations were essentially the same - the object was observed at various altitudes, ranging from 2,000 to 40,000 feet, and was sometimes obscured by clouds.

The following weather conditions were observed in the vicinity:
CHICAGO, ILL: Winds - 2,000' 27 knots, 5,000' 33 knots, 10,000' 360Â°, 23 knots
YAKIMA, WASH: 6,000' 21 knots
TACOMA, WASH: 6,000' 33 knots

There was no reported air traffic in the vicinity, and there were no known aircraft or balloons in the area at the time of the sighting.
