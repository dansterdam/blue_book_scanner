I.    Description of Incident

At 1515 Z over sixty yards of military and civilian sources observed one green, disc-shaped object. The observations continued for fifteen minutes during which time the object moved in a southwesterly direction while bobbling vertically and going sideways. There was no sound. An F-94 aircraft was scrambled but a thirty minute search of the area produced negative intercept results.

II.   Discussion of Incident

A check of adjacent radar sites revealed no unusual returns or activity in the area. The winds were generally from 210° below an overcast at 12,000*. Thus the object would appear to move against the wind 11 yards since it must have been below the clouds. There was no air traffic reported in the area.

III.  Conclusion

APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

INT-1-OFF 62D TC WING (M)     33-1     UNCLASSIFIED     PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

On 3 January 1953 the sighting of an unidentified flying object was reported by members of the 82d Maintenance Squadron, stationed at Larson AFB. The following information was gained by Lt Lb and stationed at Larson AFB.

Descriptions of the object were varied, i.e., cigar shaped, round like a cloud, edgewise of a 15-20 ft size. The consensus of opinion was that it was circular somewhat resembling a large weather balloon and all agreed that it was green in color. There was no report of sound connected with the sighting and the maneuvers were described as looking, going sideways like a play in the same general southeasterly direction from the base.

The first sighting was at 0715 and it could not be observed after 0720.

The majority of the observers were in the squadron area on the base but several reported seeing the object while driving toward the base. CAPT MACK, a small town 14 miles NW of Larson AFB. All observations were from the ground and were visual. A check with Wing Intel revealed no unusual objects or activity was noted at this time. There were no weather balloon launches from this base during the reporting period.

The following weather conditions existed over the base and in the vicinity:
LINCOLN AFB 0707) 9,000' broken, 12,000' overcast, surface winds SW 25 knots with gusts up to 35 knots visibility 15 miles.

GEIGER AFB winds aloft:
2,000'  42 knots   210°
4,000'  37 knots   220°
6,000'  51 knots   231°
8,000'  49 knots   240°
10,000'  43 knots   250°
12,000'  35 knots   260°

YAKIMA, WASH                    6,000'  21 knots   240°
TACOMA, WASH                    6,000'  38 knots   260°

All personnel reported the object just below cloud layer and heading in a South 15st direction from Larson AFB. In similar this report from stations surrounding this base. No one reported the object disappearing into the clouds, but observers reported on it to their respective jobs on this unit.

The So Commander having observed the object requested permission to send up a flight of F-94 and this was granted. They became airborne at 0713 and scanned vicinity thirty minutes after takeoff but nothing was sighted.

There was no reported air traffic in the vicinity and there were no known photographs taken.
