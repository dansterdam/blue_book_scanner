The image appears to be a scanned document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation. There is no photograph present, only text describing a UFO sighting incident that occurred in Pueblo, Colorado on May 10, 1956.

Text transcription:

ON MAY10,1956, the man hit the dog.

A CITIZEN OF PUEBLO, COLORADO, witnessed some strange activities in the sky the night of May 10, 1956.

WHILE GOING TO WORK AT THE PUEBLO PAPER MILL, driving on the main highway, just outside of PUEBLO, COLORADO, he saw a strange object descending through the sky. AT FIRST IT SEEMED BRIGHT AND RAPIDLY DESCENDING, BUT AS IT CAME CLOSER AND HE COULD SEE IT CLEALER, THE GROUND OBSERVER CORPS SAID IT APPEARED TO BE MORE OF A ROUND OBJECT RATHER THAN A BRIGHT LIGHT. 

AS USUAL THERE WERE VARIOUS DESCRPTIONS BUT EVERYONE AGREES THEY'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.

On the street REPORTING back to the ground observer Corps, he described an object that was at various times a bright fluorescent light, sometimes pulsing or blinking, and at other times it appeared as a sharply outlined dark silhouette against the sky.

He saw them between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and midnight - it would come to a hover and then dart away at a great rate of speed.

The next day this investigator was called back to Colorado Springs, his base, and a fresh team was sent to Pueblo.

The man really chomped down on the dog July and the UFO really made no findings.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document discussing strange lights observed near Pueblo, Colorado on May 15, 1956. The text describes the Air Force's investigation of the sightings, including the details reported by witnesses and the Air Force's efforts to further investigate the incidents.

AIR FORCE INVESTIGATES STRANGE LIGHTS
On May 15th, Pueblo, Colorado - strange lights in the sky near Pueblo were reported by various individuals for six successive nights. The first report was received Thursday by the Air Force. The report stated that on four successive nights, objects for an unspecified length of time near Pueblo were reported Thursday to the Air Force. The first report was made to Peterson Field here by the Pueblo GOC. Capt. Vincent Flaster, a member of the Air Force's Air Defense Filter Center, said he knows of no attempt to investigate the sightings on the intervening nights. Other reports also came to the Air Force Base at Pueblo to investigate. He reported he observed six apparitions of the objects between 9 p.m. and midnight, but one was more distinctive than the others. He said it 'faint but bright enough to see' and 'singular in shape,' but one was found and brighter than the others. Most of them were 'diamond-shaped' and from five or six seconds at a time, so great was their speed. The Air Force said it sent another team to Pueblo on Tuesday, but gave no report of its findings.
