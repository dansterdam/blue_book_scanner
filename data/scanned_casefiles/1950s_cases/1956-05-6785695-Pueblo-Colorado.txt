May 27-Pueblo, Colo.--Sighting of 'unidentified flying objects' for 8 successive nights were revealed by the 4600A Air Intelligence Service Squadron on May 10. The first sighting was made to Peterson Field, Colorado Springs, by the Public Ground Observer Corps. Intelligence Sgt. Gilbert Mayes was sent to the scene. Sightings continued nightly from May 10 to May 17, just before midnight. "They were dull, more or less fluorescent glows," he reported. "At first they were round, then one was round and brighter than the rest." A.P. reported. "When said the objects were visible for only five or six seconds at a time, as great was their speed." (Associated Press, 5/10 Los Angeles Examiner, 5/11)

Here is the text from the document:

Rupert's Book

On May10,1956, the man bit the dog.

A string of UFO sightings in Pueblo, Colorado, hit the front pages of newspapers across the United States. Starting on the night of May 5th, for six nights, the citizens of Pueblo, including the Ground Observer Corps, saw UFO's slip over their community.

As usual there were various descriptions, but everyone agreed "they'd never seen anything like it before".

On the sixth night, the Air Force sent in an investigator and he saw them. Between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and midnight he saw six groups of triangular shaped objects that glowed "with a dull fluorescence, faint but bright enough to see". They passed from horizon to horizon in six seconds.

The next day this investigator was called back to Colorado Springs, his base, and a fresh team was sent to Pueblo.

The man really chomped down on the dog in July and the UFO really made headlines.

AIR FORCE INVESTIGATES STRANGE LIGHTS

Case 160, Pueblo, Colorado, Six successive nights, early May, 1956 - Denver's Rocky Mountain News reported.

May 11 the following: "Sighting of unidentified flying objects for six successive nights near Pueblo were reported Thursday by the Air Force. The first report was made to the 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron at Peterson Field here by the Pueblo OOC, Capt. Vincent Finney, a member of the Air Force's Air Defense Filter Center, said he knows of no attempt to investigate the sightings with interceptor aircraft. Sgt. Gilbert Nelson, a member of the intelligence squadron, has been sent to Pueblo to investigate. He reported he observed six appearances of the objects between 9 p.m. and midnight Monday. They were dull, more or less fluorescent glows," he said, "faint but bright enough to see. Most of them were triangular in shape, but one was round and brighter than the rest." Nelson said the objects were visible for only five or six seconds at a time, so great was their speed.

The Air Force said it sent another team to Pueblo on Tuesday, but gave no report of its findings.
