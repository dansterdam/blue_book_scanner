Erding, Germany
29 October 1952

STATEMENT

At approximately 0750 hours on the morning of October 29, at which time I was leaving building A121 walking due west toward the Erding Bowling Alley accompanied by A/2C flying object in sighted was approximately 20 an unidentified flying object in the sky. Immediately I asked airman Handy "what is that in the sky", while pointing at the object at the same time. At the first glance it definitely was not a conventional plane, but then admitted it definitely was not a conventional aircraft, after taking a more serious look.

This object was in sight approximately 20 seconds until it disappeared from our immediate view, behind the bowling alley. It seemed to be traveling at a speed estimated at approximately 400 MPH, heading West North West on a level course, and estimated at approximately 25 degrees from the horizon. No sound was heard at any time. It was a partially cloudy morning with good visibility beneath the cloud formation there could be seen a sighted.

The object seemed to slide or glide smoothly through the air at constant speed. I could not distinguish any wings or tail on the object and it seemed to be round in shape. I could not distinguish any definite color as the object was silhouetted against the cloud background.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0750 hours on the 29th of October, while walking West toward the Erding Bowling Alley accompanied by S/Sgt I sighted what appeared to be an unidentified flying object in the sky. My attention was called to this object by S/Sgt asking "what is that in the sky?" I replied "it looks like a plane". Then I changed my mind and a further glance and said "it isn't any conventional type aircraft".

This object was in sight for approximately 20 to 30 seconds and then disappeared from our view behind the bowling alley. Its speed exceeded that of a conventional type aircraft. It was flying on a high North West course and maintained a level altitude. It appeared to be at approximately 25 degrees from the horizon. It seemed to glide through the air at a constant speed. I could not distinguish any wings or propellers. It appeared round in shape. It seemed to have a silvery color.

At no time during the sighting was any sound heard.
