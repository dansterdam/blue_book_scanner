Gentlemen:

About ten days ago I was sitting on the roof about 8 P.M. I happened to look up and I saw in the south to the west, there was a light. This light was very bright like a blur or a blur, and the objects seemed to be going up and down rapidly. It went up perhaps 3 or 4 miles and not going very fast. The sides were all illuminated and it would emit a secondary color, generally like a blue-green color. This continued for perhaps 10 or 15 minutes and then it would go down and have a red glow. I have followed it 10 minutes or more. Now it did not appear to be anything like a jet or anything like that. I do not know what it was but it was no jet as flying too slow for any jet. It was no glow for any jet, too slow. I was astonishing things no wings. It was no jet as flying.

Very truly,
Brooklyn, N. Y.
