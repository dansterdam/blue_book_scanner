Gentlemen:

About ten days ago I was sitting on the roof about 8PM; I happened to look up and toward the South by West, there was a plane or something moving saw the like before. It was a triangle precisely like an Isosceles triangle; the base some less than sides; it was up perhaps 3 or 4 miles and not going very fast. The sides were all illuminated quite bright; not white light but like ordinary color electric light. Nobody seems have seen it and no mention made. Here where I live all the plane from South and west go over this place hundreds every day.

The sky was not very clear. The sky was not very clear and high west wind. But I watched it 5 or 6 minutes and had sky been clear might have followed it 10 miles or more. Never saw anything like this before and it is a wonder. Has anyone in Wash knowledge of such a thing. It has no wings at all. My eyesight very good and no mistake about what I saw. Astonishing things no wings. It was no jet as flying too slow for any jet.

Very truly,

Brooklyn, 15, N. Y.
