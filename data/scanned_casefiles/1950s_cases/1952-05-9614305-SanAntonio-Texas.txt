1. This object appeared to be a small, flat, intensely bright, thin ob-
ject in a horizontal position. It maintained its' shape and appearance at the
same time a thin stratus layer of clouds in the same general area did change
in shape and position. The object traveled from left to right giving either
the illusion of being very high or traveling very slow. A short time later,
the object turned to a vertical position, remaining upright for eight minutes,
then slowly tilting to the near horizontal position. Again the object ascended
the vertical position, rising to a point beyond visible sight. Upon excellent-
ation upward, this object lengthened and at the same time turned to a mild red
or orange. The observer believed the object to be a flare trail rather than
a material object due to its change in length and color. The speed could not
be established, but it was estimated to have taken 4 seconds to disappear after
moving into the final vertical position.

2. The object was observed on 29 May from 1900 hrs to 1914 hrs Central
Standard Time.

3. The object was observed visually from the surface.

4. Observation was made from 29°29'N - 98°27'E (Reference Incl 2). The
object was observed at approximately 300° to 325°. The angle of vision was
approximately 250-300' from the earth's surface.

5. The information contained in this report covers the observation made
by a USAF, assigned to HQ GTAF, Randolph Field, Texas.
This officer is a pilot on flying status with 3100 hrs flying time. The source
of this information is evaluated as A1, the information, 3.

6. Weather conditions at the time of the sighting were:
    a. High thin scattered cirrus
    b. Visibility - 15 miles
    c. Temperature - 82°F
    d. Surface winds 155° 9 knots
    e. Winds at 10,000 ft. were 18 knots from 340°
    f. Winds at 20,000 ft. were 24 knots from 290°

7. Any meteorological influence on the sighting is unknown.

8. No physical evidence of the object was obtained.

9. No interception or radar identification action taken.

10. Location of any air traffic in the general area at the time of the
sighting was unavailable.

At 1930 hrs, Thurs., 29 May 52, I was standing on my front porch on
San Antonio, Texas with my wife and civilian salesman, Mr. [redacted]. When my attention was caught by what appeared to be a small, flat intensely bright cloud in a horizontal position. It was thin and maintained its shape and appearance while I watched. From its general direction did change in shapes and position. The object traveled from left to right for several minutes giving the illusion of either being very high or traveling very slowly. Upon reaching a position of being sighted over a neighboring television antenna the object slowly turned until it was in an exact vertical position without any change of shape or color. It remained in this position for eight minutes by the clock and then slowly tilted from the vertical to the near horizontal position. It then started further movement to the right. It was noted at this time that it was slowly descending which was for a few seconds only. It then proceeded to complete a gradual upward curve to an angle around 600 from horizontal. The visible object appeared to be a flame trail and not the device producing it, as evidenced by the extended and accelerated to a point beyond visible height during the period of acceleration the visible object changed from an intense yellow to a mild red or orange. The attention of my wife, Mr. [redacted] and our next door neighbor who was working on her lawn was directed to this object. With the exception of the first few minutes they also witnessed what I have described here. The total observation was observed from a bearing of approximately 300° to 325°. The angle from horizontal in the vertical plane was approximately 25-30° except for the last few seconds a the object disappeared. At this point the angle appeared to exceed 450. Except for a few thin high stratus clouds the sky was clear and visibility good.
