ACTION

[Most of the text in the body of the document is illegible]

Handwritten notes:
3/4 E4
4-4X 20


- page 5 -

The text on this page is mostly illegible. I can make out a few fragments:

At the bottom right of the page, there appears to be some text that reads "SQ" followed by some numbers, but it is too blurry to read with complete certainty.

There is a line near the bottom center that seems to read "1/2/56 JT. ROUTE" but again, this is not completely clear due to the poor image quality.

The rest of the page appears to contain rows of numbers or text, but they are too faint or blurry to accurately transcribe.

overhead to W

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj resembling balloon or parachute
& silv. in color, observed airily
overhead through binoculars. Altitude
estimated at 15,000 feet. After 20 min
moved about 10 deg. W & exploded.

11. COMMENTS
The fact that the object resembled
a balloon or parachute, but
remained aloft for at least 80
mins indicates that it was probably a balloon. Parachute would
have probably descended during
that period. Two balloon sites
are located in the Seattle area.
