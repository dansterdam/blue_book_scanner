Reference Pan American Flight 003 sighting on 8 May 1952 off East coast of U.S. Lt Rothstein talked to crew of aircraft. Pilot and co-pilot were only crew members to see objects. Co-pilot got the best view of the objects. They were on reciprocal heading to aircraft level and very close. There were three objects flying in line. They appeared to be about 10 times the size of an aircraft landing light only much whiter and much brighter. The first object was circular, and the last two objects were circular with orange-blue tails. Sighting happened at 0227 EST at 31° 20'N 70° 00'W. No known missiles of aircraft were in the area. Request that you contact the Navy to determine whether or not they had any activity in the area and whether or not the Navy had any unidentified submarine reports within reasonable area of sighting. Col Sterling in A/I Study Group knows who in Navy can give you info on submarine sightings. We are checking further on the report.

APPENDIX III
Atlantic Ocean - 8 May 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On 8 May, approximately 60 miles off the east coast of the United States, between Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia, the pilot and co-pilot of Pan American Airlines Flight 203, enroute to San Juan from New York, sighted three unidentified aerial objects. The objects were on a reciprocal heading of approximately 355° to 360° at the same altitude as the airliner.

The first object resembled a landing light but was much whiter and about ten times as large. It was followed by two slightly smaller orange objects with tapering tails which were fringed with blue. These three round objects were equally spaced and between 1/8 and 1/4 mile off the left wing.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION

The sources were interrogated and stated that the objects were completely foreign to them. There was no known missile, naval or air activity in the area at that time.

III. CONCLUSIONS

No conclusions.
