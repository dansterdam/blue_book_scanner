APPENDIX III

Atlantic Ocean - 8 May 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 8 May, approximately 600 miles off the east coast of the United States, between Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia, the pilot and co-pilot of an American Airlines flight observed unidentified flying objects (UFO's). The objects were first noticed on the pilot's radar at a distance of approximately 35° to 36° at the same altitude as the airliner.
The first object resembled a landing light but was much brighter and about ten times its larger. It was followed by two smaller orange objects with tapering tails which were tracking with extreme rapidity. Three round objects were equally spaced and traveling in a straight line off the left wing.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION
The sources were interrogated and stated that the objects were completely foreign to them. There was no known solution or air activity in the area at that time.

III. CONCLUSIONS
No conclusions.
