REPLY TO
ATTN OF: ATIC-4L82

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting                                                26 APR 1950

TO: SAFOI-3d (Maj Tacker)

1. The attached letter from Master is a brief description of a sighting which he experienced in June 1956.

2. This is a very old case, and will probably not be of much benefit to the Air Force. In addition, the facts of the case are probably very fuzzy in the witnesses memory.

3. It is suggested that a questionnaire, ATIC Form A164, be sent to Master sending this form may prevent much future correspondence with the witness concerning the sighting.

4. Master address is as follows:
Master
Lumberport, W. Va.
