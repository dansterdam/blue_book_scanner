HEADQUARTERS

APO 942 
SU BJECT: Report of Sighting of UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) 
TO: Director of Intelligence 
Headquarters, United States Air Force 
Washington 25, D. C.
  
SUBJECT: Report of Sighting of UFO 

1. On 14 September 1950, at 1330 hours, local time, the undersigned observed a single, bright, rounded, metallic object in the sky over Nunivak Island, Alaska. It was observed for approximately 1 minute and 15 seconds before disappearing from view. 

2. The object appeared to be traveling in a straight line at a high rate of speed and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 to 12,000 feet. It was observed to be bright and metallic in appearance, but did not seem to reflect sunlight. The object gave the impression of self-luminosity. No trail or exhaust was observed, nor was there any sound associated with the object. 

3. Weather conditions at the time of the observation were clear, with scattered clouds at about 5,000 feet. Visibility was excellent. The undersigned is a competent observer of aircraft, and is familiar with the various types of aircraft and their characteristics. 

4. This report is submitted in accordance with existing directives. It is requested that any further information pertaining to this incident be forwarded to this headquarters.

At about 10:20 P.M. on the night of 9 September 1950, a report was received from the Alaska Air Command indicating that an unidentified flying object had been sighted near Nunivak Island, Alaska.

It was reported that the object was first observed at about 9:15 P.M. on that date by a CAA airway communications station operator at Nunivak Island. The object was described as a bluish-white, spherical-shaped object, approximately 30 feet in diameter, that appeared to be glowing.

It was stated that the object hovered a few feet above the ground for approximately 15 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

A military aircraft was immediately dispatched to the area to investigate, but no trace of the object could be found. All attempts to locate the object or obtain further information proved fruitless.

The report was forwarded to this Headquarters for information and evaluation. No further details are available at this time.
