Here is the OCR text from the document:

One morning when we arrived at work we found at my desk a telegram from a Military Air Transport Service base in Florida. It told about a mysterious "who had been attacked by a strange and burned. The incident had been so quickly checked on the spot as could find no holes in it. He reported that the same thing had happened a week before.

I turned to the report in my superior at Air2 Col. Frank Kurtz, and he signed an endorsement which read: "I believe this is a grade with two pilots. I have something in a bag got it. I'll take it when I leave here."

Just before we left the base, the base intelligence officer came with the local intelligence officer. He was pretty well sold on the man's story. He dropped off some photographs, and when I'd heard the whole thing, I mailed a box.

He said that he had found a scout meeting in the base out of a church, and at the end of the meeting started to drive out of the base, home. The dropped off one, and then headed for the nearby town where the only three lived. He took a taxi.

That night I was nearly settled into my hotel room, but I checked the map and found that it was the local town where the three lived. From the taxi man I learned something was going.

By this time, his story went, it was around 9 p.m. As they drove through a sandy stretch with scrub pine, he saw some lights come down low into the trees and disappear. The scout master first thought, was that a plane had made a crash landing, but when he got closer he saw something that looked like a metallic object. He said he got out of his car and walked closer to the trees and saw something glowing. This time the boys thought they saw it too. The scoutmaster declared that it was his duty to see if a plane was in trouble.

He had the radio on in his car, and a quarter program was just starting. He told the boys to wait until the program was over, and if he hadn't returned, they were to go to a farmhouse a short way down the road and summon help. Taking a flashlight and a matches, he headed into the woods.

He stumbled through the night, keeping his light on the ground, until he came to a clearing, a short distance from the road.

"I suddenly noticed something odd that frightened me," he said. "I felt a damp, muggy heat on my face. It did not feel natural. At the same time I smelled a filthy pungent odor.

"I stepped into the clearing and the heat and odor grew worse. At the first glance from a furnace I glanced up to check the position of the North Star. It was a clear night and I had spotted the star when I left the auto, to orient myself. The whole sky was black."

"I was paralyzed with fear and turned my flashlight up. The beam showed in the bottom of a metallic bowl-like object. When I tried to see what it was, it seemed to move. I had kept up until I could see the stars again. Then I flashed the light up again and could see the object falling. It was about 30 feet in diameter, with things on the side like ventilators. The device was dome-shaped, with a slightly convex base. As I stepped back, the heat diminished and I could feel the cool, fresh air."
