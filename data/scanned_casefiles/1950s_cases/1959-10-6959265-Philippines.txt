k. Position Title and Comments of preparing Officer:
Chief of Operational Intelligence, Hq 13 AF, APO 74, San Francisco, California.

The following possibilities were offered by the personnel making the sighting but none of them really believed these possibilities constituted an adequate explanation:

(1) A hot air balloon with a fire in a suspended pan underneath.

(2) Re-entry and burning-up of a Soviet moon shot which occurred on the same date as the sighting.

Neither of the above explanations seems satisfactory. However, this office can offer no further possibilities.

1. Existence of Physical Evidence:
Negative.
