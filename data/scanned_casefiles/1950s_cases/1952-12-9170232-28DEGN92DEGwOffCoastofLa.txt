This image appears to be a detailed map of Louisiana and surrounding areas, with numerous cities, towns, and transportation routes marked. The map is primarily black and white and shows a complex network of lines representing roads, railways, and possibly other transportation routes. Major cities like New Orleans are prominently labeled. The map includes latitude and longitude markings along the edges. There's a small compass rose or scale indicator in the bottom left corner of the map. The map covers a large geographic area, including parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and potentially other neighboring states.

This image appears to be a detailed road map or navigation chart. It shows a complex network of roads, highways, and geographical features across what seems to be a region of the United States. The map is in black and white, with numerous place names, road lines, and geographical markers. At the bottom of the map, there is a compass rose or directional indicator. The map appears to be from an older era, likely from the 1950s based on the filename and visual style. Due to the density of information, many of the smaller text labels are difficult to read clearly.

This image appears to be a map of a region, likely in Texas, showing various cities, roads, and geographical features. The map includes latitude lines at 30° and 31°. Major cities visible include Houston, Galveston, and other smaller towns. The map is black and white and shows a dense network of roads and geographical boundaries. Some text is visible for various locations and areas, but due to the image resolution, not all text is clearly legible. The map seems to cover a significant portion of southeastern Texas, including coastal areas and inland regions.

AT 5:24 A.M. A B-29 BOMBER PILOTED BY CAPTAIN JOHN HARTER, WAS 190 MILES 01
FROM GALVESTON AND ABOUT 100 MILES SOUTH OF THE LOUISANA COAST. THE B-29, 02
CRUISING IN BRIGHT MOONLIGHT AT 18,000 FEET, WAS RETURNING TO ITS BASE IN 03
TEXAS. A MINUTE BEFORE, HARTER HAD CALLED THE RADAR OFFICER, LIEUTENANT SID 04
COLEMAN, AND ASKED HIM TO TURN ON THE SET, SO HE COULD CHECK THE COASTLINE ON 05
THE AUXILIARY SCOPE IN THE COCKPIT. 06

AT 5:25, BACK IN THE SHIP, COLEMAN WAS WATCHING THE MAIN RADARSCOPE TO SEE 07
IF THE COAST SHOWED UP, SUDDENLY, THE BLIP OF ONE UNKNOWN OBJECT APPEARED AT 08
ONE EDGE OF THE SCREEN. WHEN THE SWEEP MADE ITS NEXT REVOLUTION, COLEMAN 09
JUMPED. 10

IN THAT BRIEF MOMENT THE UNKNOWN OBJECT HAD GONE 13 MILES. 11

A THIRD BLIP LEAPED ONTO THE SCOPE AS THE ONCOMING OBJECT STREAKED TOWARD 12
THE B-29. FOR AN INSTANT IT SEEMED THEY WOULD MEET HEAD-ON. THEN COLEMAN SAW 13
THEIR PATHS WERE DIVERGING. HE SNATCHED UP HIS STOP-WATCH. YELLED FOR THE 14
FLIGHT ENGINEER. 15

*BAILEY HELP ME TRACK THIS THING.* 16

BEFORE THE BLIPS FADED, COLEMAN AND THE STAFF SERGEANT SWIFTLY COMPUTED THEIR 17
UNKNOWN'S SPEED. 18

IT WAS 5,240 MILES AN HOUR. 19

THE TWO MEN GAPED AT EACH OTHER. THEN COLEMAN GRABBED HIS INTERCOM MIKE AND 20
CALLED THE PILOT. 21

*CAPTAIN -- CHECK YOUR SCOPE. WE JUST CLOCKED AN UNKNOWN AT OVER 5,000.* 22

*THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.* SNAPPED HARTER. *RECALIBRATE THE SET.* 23

AS COLEMAN HURRIEDLY WENT TO WORK, MASTER SERGEANT BAILEY BENT OVER THE 24
SCOPE. 25

*THERE'S ANOTHER ONE -- TWO OF THEM.* HE EXCLAIMED. 26

A SECOND LATER LIEUTENANT CASSIDY, THE NAVIGATOR, CUT IN ON THE INTERCOM. 27

*I-VE GOT -- EM ON MY SCOPE, TOO* HE SAID TAUTLY. 28

BY THE TIME COLEMAN FINISHED RECALIBRATING, THE BLIPS OF FOUR UFOS WERE 29
RACING ACROSS HIS SCREEN. ABRUPTLY, HARTER'S CRISP VOICE CAME THROUGH THE 30
INTERCOM. 31

*I-VER GOT FOUR UNKNOWNS AT 12 O-CLOCK (DEAD AHEAD). WHAT DO YOU SHOW.* 32

*THEN -- ON ALL THREE SCOPES* SAID COLEMAN. *I-VE RECALIBRATED -- IT'S NO 33
MALFUNCTION.* 34

UP IN THE COCKPIT, HARTER INCREDULOUSLY WATCHED THE SWIFT-MOVING BLIPS 35
CROSS HIS GLASS. AS ONE APPROACHED ON THE RIGHT, HE CALLED OUT A HASTY ALERT. 36

*UNKNOWN ALL ALONG.* 37

BACK IN THE B-29, BAILEY SPRUNG TO THE RIGHT WAIST BLISTER AND PEERED OUT 38
INTO THE INKY BLACKNESS. HE SAW A BLUE-WHITE OBJECT STREAK FROM FRONT TO 39
REAR. MOVING SO FAST IT WAS ONLY A BLUE-WHITE BLUR, THE OBJECT VANISHED UNDER 40
THE BOMBAY. 41

THE STRANGE OBJECT HAD HARDLY DISAPPEARED WHEN ANOTHER GROUP OF BLIPS CAME 42
ONTO ALL THREE SCOPES. LIKE THE OTHER OBJECTS, THE NEW GROUP WAS MAKING OVER 43
5,000 MILES AN HOUR. TO MAKE IT WORSE, THEY WERE ALL COMING FROM ALMOST DEAD 44
AHEAD. THOUGH THIS COURSE STILL DIVERGED ENOUGH TO MISS THE BOMBER BYLMILES, 45
THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE MIGHT PUT THE CREW IN INSTANT PERIL. AT THOSE TERRIFIC 46
SPEEDS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A PRAYER. 47

SIX MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST SIGHTING, THERE WAS A SUDDEN LULL. AS THE 48
SCOPES CLEARED, COLEMAN DREW A LONG BREATH. APPARENTLY THE NIGHTMARE WAS 49
OVER. 50

A MINUTE PASSED. THE TENSE AIRMEN WERE SLOWLY BEGINNING TO RELAX WHEN A 51
THIRD GROUP OF BLIPS FLASHED ONTO THE SCOPES. COLEMAN SEIZED HIS STOP-WATCH, 52
SWIFTLY CALLED OFF THE TIMES AND DISTANCES. BAILEY FIGURED THE SPEEDS, GRIMLY 53
NODDED. 54

*SAME AS BEFORE,* HE MUTTERED. 55

THE RADAR OFFICER BENT OVER THE SCREEN. TWO OF THE UFOS WERE ROCKETING BYSE 56
ON THE RIGHT. 57

*UNKNOWN'S AT FOUR O-CLOCK.* HE BAWLED INTO THE MIKE. 58

STAFF SERGEANT FERRIS BEAT A BAILEY TO THE WAIST BLISTER. OPEN-MOUTHED, HE 59
WATCHED TWO OBJECTS STREAK BY -- MERE BLURS OF WHITE LIGHT THAT SHOT FORTY 60
MILES AN HOUR. THE OBJECTS WERE RACING STRAIGHT FOR THE B-29, CUTTING ACROSS 61
ITS COURSE. 62

SUDDENLY THE OBJECTS SWERVED, HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THE B-29. HARTER FROZE 63
AT THEIR TERRIFIC SPEED THEY WOULD CLOSE THE GAP IN THREE SECONDS. 64

BUT BEFORE HE COULD MOVE THE CONTROLS, AN INCREDIBLE THING HAPPENED. 65

ABRUPTLY THE ONRUSHING UFOS SLOWED TO THE BOMBER'S SPEED. FOR TEN SECONDS 66
THEY KEPT PACE BEHIND IT, WHILE THE PILOT HELD HIS BREATH. 67

THEN, SWIFTLY PICKING UP SPEED, THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS PULLED OFF TO ONE SIDE, 68
AT THE SAME MOMENT HARTER CAUGHT SIGHT OF A HUGE BLIP -- A HALF-INCH SPOT ON 69
THE SCOPE, AMAZED, HE SAW THE MOST FANTASTIC THING OF ALL. 70

STILL MOVING AT OVER 5,000 MILES AN HOUR, THE SMALLER OBJECTS MERGED WITH 71
THE LARGER OBJECT. INSTANTLY, THE HUGE BLIP BEGAN TO ACCELERATE, MOVING SO 72
FAST THAT HARTER SAT STUNNED. IT FLASHED ACROSS HIS SCOPE AND WAS GONE. 73

A FEW MOMENTS LATER, COLEMAN AWED, VOICE CAME THROUGH THE INTERCOM. 74

*CAPTAIN, DID YOU SEE THAT.* 75

*YES,* SAW IT,* SAID HARTER. 76

*WE CLOCKED IT,* SAID COLEMAN. *YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS -- IT WAS MAKING 77
78

SHOWED THEIR FIRM CONVICTION. 87

CALIBRATED, TO ARC ABOUT 30 MILES AND SWING IN BEHIND US AT ABOUT 30 MILES AND 89
MAINTAIN SPEED AND DISTANCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN SECONDS. CONTACT WAS 90

THE ENTIRE CREW TO LOOK FOR THE OBJECTS VISUALLY, AND FLASHES OF LIGHT WERE 97
NOTED. THE CLOSEST THE OBJECTS CAME WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES. I SAW ABOUT 98
20 OBJECTS IN ALL. I RECALIBRATED THE SET AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE. 99
*THE OBJECTS WERE SMALL AND POSSIBLY ROUND, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE VERY 00

DISAPPEAR. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT WAS REAL 03
AND MOVED AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED AND WAS NOT A SET MALFUNCTION OR OPTICAL 04

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Approaching the end of a night practice flight to Florida, the B-29 was cruising in bright, moonlit sky at 18,000 feet. At 9:25 a.m., the big bomber, piloted by Capt. John Harter, was 150 miles from Jacksonville and about 100 miles off the Louisiana coast.

Before Harter could move the controls, an incredible thing happened. The onrushing UFOs slowed to the bomber's speed. For 10 seconds, they kept pace. Then, swiftly picking up speed, the unknown machines pulled off to one side. At the same moment, Harter caught sight of a huge blip - half-inch spot on a scope.

Staff Sergeant Perris began to apply to the blister. He watched two machines streak by mere blurs of blue-white light. Up in the cockpit, Lt. Harter's eyes were glued to the auxiliary scope. Forty miles away, five of the scopes were tracking behind the bomber. Suddenly, the tracers averted. Headed straight for the B-29. Before Harter could move the controls, an incredible thing happened.

Another blip leaped onto the scope as the unknown object streaked toward the B-29. For an instant, it seemed that they would meet head-on. Then Coleman yelled for the flight engineer. "Help me track this thing."

Before the blips faded, Coleman and another engineer swiftly computed the unknown's speed. "That's impossible," snapped Harter. "Recalculate the math."

By the time Coleman finished recalculating, the blips were racing across his scope. "Try it," said Coleman. "Five separate tracks, no malfunction."

Master Sergeant Bailey leaped to the right - was blister radar to the blue-lit object streak from front to rear. Warning no false alarm, the strange machine had hardly disappeared when another group of blips came into all three scopes.

Like the other machines, the new group was making over 5,000 miles an hour. To make it worse, they were all coming from almost dead ahead. Though their course still diverged enough to miss the bomber by miles, the slightest change might have put the crew in instant peril. At those terrific speeds, they wouldn't have a prayer, and every man aboard knew it.

Six minutes after the first sighting, there was a sudden halt. The radar officers were beginning to relax when a third group of blips flashed onto the scope. The radar officer kept over. The screen - Two UFOs were making by on the 100-mile range.

"Radar stated at that time he had 50-mile range on, indicating a movement of 12-14 miles. With each successive revolution, the blips continued SE to a point 15-20 miles from the ship at a bearing of 70 to deg. and then out of the scope. At 150 deg. radar gave the instructor flight engineer the time and distance, which was computed as 5,000 mph. These groupings of blips occurred for about 5 minutes and speeds were recomputed.

During this period, student navigator and instructor radio viewed the aux. scope and confirmed my observations. At this time, I called for radar to calibrate his set to eliminate any possibility of malfunction. He did this speedily, and when he scanned the scope once more, the blips reappeared moving SE across the scope. I called off two separate blips track and position in relation to the aircraft by the clock system over interphone of the ship, and as they passed at 7 o'clock, the instructor engineer visibly saw a blue-bright white flame go from front to rear under our wing. Contact was broken off at 0535 after a group of the blips merged into a 1/2-inch curved arc about 30 miles from our aircraft at 320 deg. and proceeded across the scope and off it at a computed speed of over 9,000 mph. At all times during the contact, the aircraft was level and stable, the weather was clear, not a cloud in the sky, and visibility was excellent. There was a full moon, giving excellent water reflection. The aircraft was flying long-range cruise at the time. Radar checked the blips at all scan tilt angles full up and down and didn't lose the blips until the scanning antenna was pointed down. One group of blips after the scope was calibrated were noted, after moving from 330 deg. to 150 deg. across the scope, to arc about 30 miles behind us at approximately 30 miles and maintain speed and distance for approximately 10 seconds and then disappear.

A Cluster of Lights

The ATIC comment was: "All possibilities were checked for known aerial phenomena. The conclusion was: 'Unknown'."

14 March 1961

I ask that question of Dec. 4, 1952; what conclusion in the Gulf of Mexico case, where three groups of UFO's were seen and radar-tracked by the crew of AF B-29 bombers, and a very large object was tracked at over 9,000 mph after one group of UFO's had merged with it?

a. The object which was tracked by radar 6 December 1952 is carried as an unidentified in the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center files.
