k. Position title and comments of the preparing officers: Captain Martin S. Doria, Asst Provost Marshal, Sheppard AFB, Texas, on 8 November 1958; Major Lynn H. Robson, AC 64984B, Provost Marshal, Sheppard AFB, Texas; Martin S. Doria, 453774, Air Police Officer, 3750th Air Police Squadron, proceeded to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] at Temple, Oklahoma.

Mr. [redacted] stated that on 10 October 1958, an object appearing to be a plastic balloon was caught in a small tree located at the rear of his property. He further stated that the object had a note attached to the bottom and was written in the Russian language. He didn't actually see the object in flight however the wind had been blowing from the Northeast to the assumed that was the direction it came from.

When asked if the object was still in their possession they produced a folded, clear type, soft plastic, rectangular sheet measuring approximately 71 x 7". They described it as having the corners tied together by an ordinary string in a parachute type of affair. The note was attached to the strings. Several holes in the plastic were observed by the investigators and it was assumed that the damage was a result of damage by the tree branches. He (Mr. [redacted]) further stated that they had thrown the during away and turned the note over to U.S. Army officials at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The investigators had no further information regarding the incident so the investigators requested that the plastic sheet be placed in their custody. Their request was agreed and signified that they had no desire to have the object returned to them.

Chief of Staff, G-2, Fort Sill, Oklahoma was contacted telephonically in order to determine the location of the note allegedly attached to the balloon, stated he would make inquiry and on 13 November 1958 a letter was received from the investigators from that office at Fort Sill station that Major Robert W. Region VII, 142th CIG Group, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, had forwarded the note to the FBI office in that city on or about 16 October 1958. Major Brotherton did not know what disposition the FBI made of the note.

1. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: Negative (balloon) enclosed. Note written in Russian may be in possession of FBI, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

A search of the immediate area of discovery revealed no unusual or identifying data. It appears that this incident would be two possibilities: (1) A grounded weather balloon, (2) A hoax.

The complete absence of weather equipment plus the description of the object when found as given by the Copeland leads the writer to believe that the incident is a hoax.

       1. The plastic bag herewith accompanying the basic IR is of ordinary
       polyethylene of the size, thickness and shape in daily use by weather stations.

       2. The small size of the bag completely precludes any possibility that it
       may have crossed the Pacific Ocean on the prevailing westerly winds.

       3. The note, not included but herein described, which was written in
       Russian and attached to the balloon by a string, was evidently copied from a
       Russian phrase book, such as those furnished to Foreign-based U.S. troops, or
       which can be purchased at any good book store. Even the juxtaposition of the
       two rather unrelated phrases is typical of the foreign language phrase book
       format.

       4. The comments of the officer who prepared IR-1-58 are fully concurred
       in, to wit:

           a. This is a grounded weather balloon.

           b. The attachment of the note, written in Russian is a prank.

1. On this date, the following Summary of Information was furnished this District Office by the Commander, Region VII, 112th CIC Group, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma:

"VI. (U) Miscellaneous Counterintelligence Information:

1. On 13 October 1958, the following information was received from Joseph H. Cason, Major, Arty, Liaison Officer, Office of the AC of S, G-2, Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Cason advised that it had been reported to the Office of the AC of S, G-2, by a resident of Lawton, Oklahoma, that on 10 October 1958, an unidentified balloon had landed on the property of a Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] at Temple, Oklahoma. The balloon was described as being approximately seven (7) feet square (deflated), and constructed of a thin plastic material. The balloon carried no instruments of any kind. However, either a note was attached to the balloon or inscribed on the balloon was the following phrase, written in the Russian language: "If do not understand Russian, How are you?". According to Bolan, the balloon is still in possession of the [redacted]. (B-6)

The phrase which had been written in the Russian language was translated by a Marshall R. Hurley, Captain, 0204178U, Btry "A", 2d How Bn, 37th Arty, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Hurley opined that the phrase appeared to be one that would have normally appeared in a small pamphlet-type foreign language dictionary issued to the American soldier during the DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS FOR CONVERSATIONAL PURPOSES. (B-2)

DECLASSIFIED: On request the foregoing be furnished the Commander, Sheppard AFB, Texas, as the Air Force installation nearest Temple, Oklahoma. (Paragraph 903, CSIR Nr 54)
