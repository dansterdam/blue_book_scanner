Mr. stated that on 10 October 1958, an object appearing to be a celestial balloon was sighted in a small location at Temple, Oklahoma. He further stated that the object had a white, luminous glow and was approximately the size of a basketball. He said that the object was observed for several minutes and that it was the direction it came from that was the direction it went. 

When asked if the object was still in their possession they produced a folded, clear type, soft plastic, rectangular sheet measuring approximately 6 1/2 x 9 inches. The original object was now lost and the investigators requested that the plastic sheet be placed in their custody. The investigators had no desire to have the object and returned it to them.

ORIGINATING AGENCY
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, sighting Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas
Chief of Staff, G-2, 11 Oct 58, incident on 22 September 1958.
According to the information attached, a pilot of the 54th Fighter Bomber Squadron of the 81st Air Division at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas, sight ed an unidentified flying object on 22 September 1958. The incident was reported to the investigators from that office and, according to this report, the investigators from the 1st. I&E Group were notified and interviewed the pilot. The pilot stated that he did not know what disposition the FBI made of the case. Brotherton did not know what disposition the FBI made of the case.
1. A photograph of the incident was received. The photograph (balloon) enclosed. It is written on the reverse in Russian and may be in answer to a request to the Soviets. COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
A search of the immediate area of discovery revealed no unusual or characteristic marks or indications in the flying object. It appears that this incident would be the result of an ordinary (?) weather balloon.
The complete absence of weather equipment plus the description of the objects when found as given by the operands leads the writer to believe that the incident is as stated.

FROM: AFOIN-4E2
DATE: 24 NOV 58
COMMENT NO.: 2
AFOIN-4E20/P.G. #4806circ, Jr. /ow;

1. The plastic bag herewith accompanying the basic IR is of ordinary polyethylene of the size, thickness and shape an inflated by weather stations.

2. The small size of the bag completely precludes any possibility that it may have crossed the Pacific ocean on the prevailing westerly winds.

3. The notes, not included herein, described, which was written in Russian and attached to the balloon by a string, was evidently copied from a Russian picture book such as those disseminated by US troops, or which can be purchased at any good book store. Even the juxtaposition of the two rather unsolicited phrases in the foreign language phase book is typical of the contents.

4. The comments of the officer who prepared IR-1-56 are fully concurred in, to wit:
a. This is a grounded weather balloon. 
b. The attachment of the note, written in Russian is a prank.

Evaluation of Source Reliability (Unknown)

Analysis and Conclusions:
The object was determined to be a small size of the coluored celestial phenomena of the type utilized by weather observers. The small size of the object and its rarity of occurrence, along with the difficulty of determination, indicate that it cannot be classified as anything very unusual. Many similar celestial phenomena have been discovered. The object observed cannot be satisfactorily explained from the evidence available - some of the details of the sighting remain uncertain."

1. On this date, the following summary of information was furnished this District Office by the Commander, Region VII, 112th CIC GROUP, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma:

"VI. (U) Miscellaneous Counterintelligence Information:
On 23 October 1958, the following information was received from Joseph H. Cason, Jr., an Airman First Class, USAF, of the 5082d Target Control Squadron, Sheppard AFB, Texas:

Cason advised that it had been reported to the Office of the AG of S-2 Commanderr at Lawton, Oklahoma, that on 19 October 1958, an unidentified balloon had landed on the property of S.F. Temple, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The balloon was described as being approximately seven (7) feet square (deflated) and consisting of a thin plastic material. No instruments of any kinds. However, either a note was attached to the balloon or information was given on the balloon itself, the following phrase in the Russian language: 'I do not understand Russian. How are you?' According to Cason, balloon is still in possession of the S.F. Temple, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

The phrase which had been written in the Russian language was translated by a linguist consulting 23rd Art'y, Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to merely contain the phrase 'How are you?' The linguist further advised that this would normally appeared in small pamphlets or leaflet drops directed to the American soldier during the DOWNGRADE RESTRICTIONS:
DECLASSIFIED (SEE) BOTTOM OF SUB-PARAGRAPH)

DDI: Request the foregoing be furnished the Commander, Sheppard AFB, Texas, as the Air Force installation nearest Temple, Oklahoma. (Reference: 903, CSDN Nr 51)."
