7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
four hours

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One round white object larger than any star or planet. Object seemed to change shape and occasionally emit points of reddish glowing light in all directions. Points of light were similar to a jet exhaust. Object was initially sighted at 50 dgr azimuth & moved from SE to E. Object disappeared from view and reappeared in the same location. Object was observed visually & through binoculars for over two hours.

11. COMMENTS
Form sent to sources and following information received: Object observed for a total of four hours. Object moved in 110 dgr az, 10°ie at 2015CST to 22, 700°ie at 0015CST. At 0015CST obj disappeared "as if a light switch had been turned off." Duration, general course & position, & description of obj conform to criteria for a Mars hypothesis. However due to conflicting statement of one source that obj disappeared.

Case evaluated as ASTRO (probable).
