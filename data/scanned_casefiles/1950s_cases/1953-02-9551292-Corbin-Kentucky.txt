Here is the text from the document:

a later period six additional objects were noted. No report traffic, however,
or could was noted. This case is carried in the PBB files as being too to
balloons, but abstract proves a much more likely solution in view of the re-
ported ground and maneuvers.

7. At Patrick AFB, Florida, on 12 July 1952, six separate observations of
five different series of objects, located on 18 miles, were reported. The
initial object which set off the series of observations was a wandering
colored object which was white, red, and green. Following this initial
this report were other sightings according various 16-20 miles which were observed for
short periods of time, generally at 10 second. Sightings at 18 miles were
ground visual and radar tracking. The objects were described as round, oval,
varying manner. These sights are theoretical, but it is probable that
they were mirages.

8. There is no case in the PBB files from May 30 to 31 in Michigan
during the month of July 1952.

9. At Glenn Bay, Michigan, on 25 September 1952, pilots of a B-29 and a
F-94 at approximately, witnessed one or close to a brief object which
was identified as an astronomical body.

10. There is no case in the PBB files from northern Michigan on 24
November 1951.

11. There were three cases from Japan on 29 December 1952:
    a. At Chitose at 1930-2000 hours a pilot attempted to close on a target.

    b. At Misawa a pilot reported a UFO which was determined to have been
    due to the misidentification of an astronomical body.

    c. At 1948-2005 there was an aerial observation of an unidentified
    flying object which was determined to be Venus.

12. There is no case in the PBB files from Japan on 19 April 1952.

13. On 26 September 1952 in the Azores nucleus of an aircraft observed two
lights for over an hour. These light fluctuated in color and brightness.
They were about 30Â° apart in azimuth and maintained their relationship to
each other throughout the period. The case is considered as significant,
but in all probability the sighting was due to the misidentification of
different lights on surface vessels.

14. UFO reported from York Mall and identified as a B-47.

15. There is no case in the PBB files from Korea on 7 January 1953.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast. I can partially make out some text in the bottom right section which appears to read:

"District Agent
District, Michigan"

And a partial line above that which seems to start with "I would..." but the rest is not clear enough to confidently transcribe.

The rest of the document is too faded and blurry to reliably read.
