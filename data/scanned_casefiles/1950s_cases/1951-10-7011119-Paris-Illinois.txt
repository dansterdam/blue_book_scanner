AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Partially obscured header information]

1. A unidentified metallic object was observed by [partially obscured] Chief of Harrah Consolidated, Colo. Stolen Municipal Airport, Terre Haute, Indiana was on a flight on 27 October 1951 at 1542 CST for approximately 15 seconds.

2. The following description was obtained in an interview with Mr. Snyder and SAT agent, 12th District Office CAA, Chanute AFB, Illinois: Virgil Snyder, who was ground and big radio of a half dollar plane held at a distance of about 3 miles. Altitude was given as about 1000 feet. Terrain was open country, projectile system unknown, and estimated up to 5650 mph.

3. Object was sighted visually from the ground and observed in travel a short path in a northwesterly direction. Electronic surveillance device (CG-13 located at Boonville, Ind) was used to sighting was reported.

4. Weather CAVU with-height was made at Chanute AFB on 27 October 1951 at 1730 at 3 knots average. 1000 feet 3.3.0, wind 260 degrees average direction 150 degrees at 5 knots average. No physical evidence available in investigative body.

5. [Partially obscured text] a pilot, sighted a similar object on the same day at 1530 hours, near Watseka, Illinois, at 5000 feet. Object was seen traveling in a northeasterly direction south of atomic energy plant at Newport, Indiana.

6. Although accurate measurement of the distance between sighting number one by Mr. [obscured] and sighting number two by [obscured] is not possible. From the information available, it appears as though the object would not have been traveling more than 20 miles (30 miles from Indian airport) in the time the sightings were of the same object.

Appendix IX

PARIS, ILLINOIS - 9 October 1951

On 9 October 1951, at approximately 1345 CST, a private pilot en route from Champaign, Illinois, to Paris, Illinois, sighted a silver object just east of Paris, 11 miles, at 5,000 ft. altitude. The object appeared to be stationary, in one such position at 11 o'clock, and then began to approach the aircraft. The object then started to travel in a north-easterly direction south of the Newport, Indiana, Atomic Energy plant.

(See Appendix VIII for related incident.)

Weather

Clear, bright sun, no clouds or haze.

Status of Investigation

More details of the incident will be obtained. Weather balloons are known from Chanute AFB which is approximately 14 miles NW of the location of the incident. It is very doubtful if this object was a balloon as the balloon would have risen to a much higher altitude if it had drifted SE from Chanute AFB.

TWO SIGHTINGS BY A PROMINENT SCIENTIST IN
CHARGE OF HIGH-ALTITUDE COSMIC RAY RESEARCH

October 10, 195 -- Two observers
"We had just spotted our trajectory flight
and were approaching (in a small plane) from
the north at an altitude of 4,000 feet. We
started to climb towards the balloon on a
course of 230 deg. At 6,000 feet I noticed
a strange object crossing the skies from the
east to west, a great deal higher and behind
our balloon. I estimate that our balloon was
at approximately 20,000 feet at the time.
Using our balloon for comparison, this
object appeared to be about 1/4 the size of
the balloon. We were climbing and about six
miles northeast of the balloon. The object
had a peculiar glow to it, crossing behind
and above our balloon from east to west very
rapidly, first coming in at a slight dive,
leveling off for about a minute and along
down, then into a sharp left turn and climb
at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees into the
southeast with a terrific acceleration and
disappeared.
J.D. and I observed this object for approximately two minutes and it crossed
through an arc of approximately 40 to 45
degrees. We saw no vapor trail and from
past experience I know that this object was
not a balloon, jet, conventional aircraft or
celestial star. J.J.K.

October 11, 1951 -- Four witnesses
"D. R. and I were flying at 10,000 feet
observing the grab bag balloon when I saw
a brightly glowing object to the southeast
of the University of M. Airport. I pointed
it out to D and we both made the following
observations:
The object was moving from east to west
at a high rate and very high. We tried keep-

State Report #1

APPENDIX A
PARIS, ILLINOIS - 6 October 1951

On 6 October 1951, at approximately 1715 hrs, a review on survey of aircraft was made near Paris, Illinois, while a military aircraft was observed. The object then sighted was a silver colored object, which was observed by ground personnel. In the course of conversation, to the effect that the object was not a known aircraft, the observer was asked to describe the aircraft. Direction south of the Tremont, Illinois, Atomic Energy Plant.

(See Annex VIII for related incident)

Weather:
Clear, bright sun, no clouds or haze.

Special Investigation:
More details of the incident will be obtained. Observer believes this is an opportunity. 15 miles or 20 miles off the location of the balloon. Would have been to a much higher altitude than a balloon. From Chanute AFB.

1. SYNOPSIS: Chief Aircraft Communicator, CAA, Terre Haute, Indiana, Municipal Airport, Terre Haute, Indiana, reported to the Office of Special Investigations on 9 October 1951 at 1342 hours he observed an unknown unidentified aerial object directly overhead at Hulman Municipal Airport. The object was approximately the size of a half-dollar coin and was flying in a southeasterly direction. The day was clear and informant's vision was unobstructed. Exact size and altitude of the object unknown. Informant saw a pilot, once sighted a similar object on the same date at approximately 1345 hours just east of Paris, Illinois at approximately 5,000 feet. Object was seen traveling in a northeasterly direction, south of the Atomic Energy Plant at Newport, Indiana.

2. DETAILS: Mr. [redacted], Terre Haute, Indiana, Chief Aircraft Communicator, Civil Aeronautics Authority, Hulman Municipal Airport, Terre Haute, Indiana, was interviewed on 12 October 1951 by Special Agent [redacted] in Paris, and stated that he had observed an unknown unidentified aerial object at 1342 hours, Tuesday, 9 October 1951. The object was sighted directly overhead at Hulman Municipal Airport which is located approximately five (5) miles east of Terre Haute, Indiana, on Indiana State Road No. 42. According to Mr. [redacted], the object was approximately the size of a one-half dollar and its color was silver in color and flow in a southeasterly direction.

120-11-100, Subj: UNKNOWN SUBJECT, Unidentified Aerial Object Sighted Over Hulman Municipal Airport, Terre Haute, Indiana, 9 October 1951

Observed no vapor trails; heard no noise and observed no protruding fins or other protrusions on this aerial object. Stated he observed the object pass from directly over his horizon in approximately fifteen seconds which he considered to be a conservative estimate of time. The sky was clear, a bright sun, no clouds or haze, vision was not obstructed by trees or other foliage or buildings and the object traveled over flat terrain. Shape and general form of object could still be observed at the time it disappeared over the horizon. The speed was such that no could make the object's size or altitude. According to [illegible], if this object was 200 feet high, it would have been traveling approximately 2,250 miles per hour and that the speed in miles per hour would increase in proportion to the object's height. [illegible] further stated that either this object or another was sighted by Charles Warren, South Seventh Street, Terre Haute, Indiana, an approximately 1345 hours, Tuesday, 9 October 1951, just east of Paris, Illinois at 5,000 feet. Warren was flying a private plane at an altitude of 5,000 feet from Greencastle, Indiana, to Paris, Illinois, and slightly west of Paris, Illinois at 5,000 feet. The object appeared to be stationary at 5,000 feet, remained as it did not increase or diminish in size with the approach of the plane. The object then reversed its direction and was last seen traveling in a northeasterly direction south of the Atomic Energy Plant at Newport, Indiana.
