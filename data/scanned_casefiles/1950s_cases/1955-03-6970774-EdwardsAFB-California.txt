TOTAL ANALYSIS OF CASE INDICATES THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED MOVED AT HIGH SPEED AND DRIFTED TO THE GROUND CAUSING A DISTURBED AREA OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE SCATTERED ROCKS & DIRT SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE METEORITE LANDING. FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF SITE BY BASE PERSONNEL INDICATED NO EVIDENCE OF ABNORMAL ACTIVITY OR RADIATION DETECTED. CASE CLOSED AND FILED.
