SAUCER SIGHTED FROM AIRLINER OVER GULF OF MEXICO: On January 22nd, at about 8-50 p.m., a large cigar-shaped object was seen by the flight engineer of a Pan American flight from Houston to Miami. The object was not in view long enough to be seen by the captain, who was at the time of the copilot, who at that moment had his head bent low, adjusting instruments.

According to the flight engineer, named _______, the object took only about six seconds from the southern horizon to a weather front near the northern horizon. The saucer had a pale blue luminescence to it, and a yellow flickering flame or light in the rear. The strangest thing about this sighting was that there was no trajectory to the path of the object. It traveled on a straight-line level course, about 30 degrees above the Pan American plane. (Our thanks to _______ of Miami for sending in this information)
