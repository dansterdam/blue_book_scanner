MISCELLANY
GULF OF SLAM
Second Officer P. Hansen of the Danish M.S. Arnold Maersk, 
Capt. S. Bjergegaard, Master, reports observing a peculiar phenomena of lights on December 13, 1953, in latitude 32° 24' N., longitude 73° 16' W. These lights extended to the horizon in all directions and were similar to very luminous phosphorescence. They appeared to be about 2 feet above the sea and the interval between pulsations was about one-tenth second and the display lasted for 15 minutes. The weather conditions were heavy clouds, wind NNW, force 3, sea moderate.
