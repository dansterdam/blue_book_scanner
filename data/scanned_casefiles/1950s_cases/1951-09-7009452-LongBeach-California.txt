MARCH AIR F.G. BASE - 22 SEPTEMBER 1952

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT
The first report of this incident, which appeared in the Project Blue Book file, indicates that the discrepancies and the following account of the incident is considered to be:
At approximately 0700 PST, two F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George Air Force Base, Victorville, California, to investigate an unidentified object that had been reported overheading in the vicinity of March Air Force Base, Riverside, California. The flight reported to GCI that they observed an unidentified object which was at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet and appeared to be in a left orbit at about 4,000 ft. The object continued to maneuver, made a left orbit and passed over the two aircraft. At one point the object appeared to be in a left orbit at about 4,000 ft. The object continued to maneuver, made a left orbit and passed over the two aircraft. At one point the object appeared to be in a left orbit at about 4,000 ft. and at another point it was observed to be at approximately 55,000 ft. The pilots stated that the object appeared to be a fuel shortage. At approximately 0820 PST, four additional F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George Air Force Base to relieve the two above-mentioned F-86's. The four aircraft were vectored to the vicinity of the object, however, the object was not observed again. It had apparently departed the area, going in a direction, according to the pilots, which appeared to be a swept-wing aircraft.
The second element of the group, which had maintained visual contact with the object throughout, reported that on the overlay, observed in flight, the object apparently increased speed, leveled off at approximately 55,000 ft. and then proceeded to dive. The F-86's, however, were unable to close the gap. It was reported that the object appeared to be round and silver.
No more intercepts were attempted. At no time was the object observed on the radar scopes nor was it reported to be definitely tracked by radar.
The F-86's, however, were definitely tracked by radar.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
At 0700 PST a radiosonde balloon was released from the Long Beach Municipal Airport. The balloon which was lost at 0721 PST, sighted from the airport, bearing of 95° true, due to a malfunction and tracking equipment. The point on ground was approximately 40,000 ft. The winds above 10,000 ft. are unknown but it is logical to assume that a constant direction of 270° and an average velocity of 20 knots above 15,000 ft. and 30 knots above 20,000 ft. The balloon was tracked up to 50,000 ft. at which point it disappeared. According to a telemetering constant direction of 270° and an average velocity of 20 knots above 15,000 ft. and 30 knots above 20,000 ft. The balloon was tracked up to 50,000 ft. at which point it disappeared.

Referring to the ground track of Flight 2-A, if a 30 knot wind at 270° is assumed, at 0910, the approximate time the F-86's sighted the object, the balloon would be at an altitude of 46,700 ft. and nearly directly over the aircraft. The altitude of the aircraft at this point was approximately 42,500 ft. It would seem that the balloon could have been mistaken for a strange object. Once again the orbiting of the object cannot be explained.

The attempted intercept by Flight 2-B cannot be explained. If the ground track of the balloon is plotted as indicated, it is correct to assume that the flight was observing a balloon. The time at which they sighted the object is not known. It is highly possible that a wind shift or nearly 360° could occur between the time of the original sighting and the attempt to intercept it, due to the high altitude of the object.

The possibility of this object being an experimental aircraft from overseas appears extremely remote. The case was checked with negative results. No other balloons were observed in the vicinity.

III. CONCLUSION
With the information available, it cannot be concluded that the object was definitely the radiosonde balloon launched at 0700. However, since the balloon was near the flight path of the two aircraft, it can be concluded that the unidentified object observed was possibly the balloon.

23 September 1951 - 0230 PST, an unidentified object was sighted over Long Beach, California. Four US aircraft were scrambled and the object was described as being similar to a balloon with four lights. The object was at an altitude of 23,000 feet and moved in a straight line for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing. Weather conditions at the time were such that the object's movement could be easily observed.

Balloons were released from San Diego, Long Beach and Santa Maria, California at approximately 2220 PST. All of these stations reported that their balloons were released and weather station personnel stated that it would be very doubtful if their balloons could have been mistaken for the object observed.

All of the major aircraft factories and installations containing experiments on flights of experimental aircraft stated that no experimental aircraft were in the air at the time of the incident.

Additional information has been requested as to additional details of the incident, such as times and locations during the attempted interception by the F-86A and other possible balloon launchings.

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Object Over Long Beach, California.

REFERENCE: Memo to Has Lost - dated 26 October 1951

The Commanding General, 27th Air Division, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, California, requested an investigation concerning the sighting of an unidentified object observed from Norton AFB on the evening of 25 October 1951 between 1930 and 2030 hours at 50,000 feet. Four P-51s were dispatched to investigate and establish contact with the object. During the climb to the altitude of 43,000 feet, the object disappeared. Visual contact was maintained only for a very short period of time and the object was described to be a swept wing fighter type aircraft. A check with aircraft maintenance indicated that no experimental aircraft had scheduled test flights on that date.

Observations made upon the object were as follows: It was estimated to be a brilliant light source, possibly illuminating an object at an altitude of 50,000 feet. It was found that all three of the P-51 aircraft were lost during the unsuccessful attempt to make contact with the unidentified object. It was determined from later investigation that the object sighted was one of the balloons which had been released just prior to the time this object was reportedly seen.

DETAILS: This communication is a letter from the Commanding General of the 27th Air Division, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, to the Director of the Office of Intelligence, USAF, requesting this District Office to make an investigation concerning the sighting of an unidentified object over Long Beach, California, on 23 September 1951.
At the time this matter was referred to this office, the 27th Air Division had published an Intelligence Report which sets forth the following information:
On 23 September 1951, at 16:02, an object was sighted and reported over Long Beach, California, at an altitude of 50,000 feet. Four (4) F-86 were dispatched to investigate the object but were unable to reach it because of its high speed and altitude. The object was described as round, silver in color, with a constant steady rate in the vicinity. No trails or exhaust were observed, indicating that it was not a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft.
Weather balloons in the vicinity were at 30,000 feet altitude, and the object's altitude was estimated to be 20,000 feet above them, or approximately 50,000 feet.
The incident that was sighted was observed by Captain J. R. STEELE, Chief Controller, ADCC, from Mojave, and verified by Major MEILZE, Operations Officer, 732nd AC&W Squadron.
Major MEILZER checked towards ATC for any known flights in the area at that time, and no conventional aircraft had been confirmed that could be this object. Captains IOYEM, UYEOKA, and George AFB Operations had been alerted and reported that no flights were in the area.
Major MANUSSEIER, OIC of the 729th AC&W Squadron, located at Edwards AFB, whose squadrons cover the area, stated that no activity till 2000 hours had been experienced with T-33 and X-F6 N.A.D.C. The Boeing with the D-558, and Northrop with the X-3, had been grounded for the day.

FEFRARDS AFB WEATHER STATION reported that Santa Maria, San Diego and Long Beach loos which can easily rise to 50,000 feet, and can expand "like a balloon" if they stay 25,000-30,000 feet for a period. The flight that was witnessed by Mr. Harvey and others was described to the balloon as a "major." MIZER also spoke to CAPTAIN HARVEY, one of the pilots who sighted the object (see enclosed statement), who stated the object appeared to be circular when he sighted it and not going "too fast." 

STATEMENT
23 September 1951

On 25 September 1951 at approximately 0910 ST a bogie was sighted by Capt James H. Harvey, USAF. When we sighted this bogie, it appeared to be over 20,000 feet in the vicinity of March Air Force Base.

When 13,000 feet and above, the bogie appeared to be between 15,000 and 22,000 feet and also appeared to be a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft. He was also noted to be in a constant orbit.

1. The object, first sighted, was observed to travel due North for some 100 miles and then South for another 100 miles, according to numerous witnesses. It was described as a round, bright, shiny object, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and traveling at an estimated speed of 1500 to 2000 miles per hour. 

2. Special Agent ARTHUR J. MAKOILE made inquiry at the following locations in an effort to determine if they were conducting any experimental aircraft on 23 September 1951:

Northrop Aircraft Company, Hawthorne, California
North American Aviation, Inc., Inglewood, California
Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc., El Segundo, California
Lockheed Aircraft Company, Burbank, California
Hughes Aircraft Company, Culver City, California

It was found that none of these companies was test flying any experimental aircraft on the date this object was seen. The above companies are under contract to the U.S. Air Forces and U.S. Navy.

6. Special Agent THOMAS J. McKARLY made inquiry at the consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation, San Diego, California, and they advised that, although they were presently working on experimental aircraft, they did not conduct any flights on 23 September 1951.

7. Colonel C. E. JACKSON, Air Force Engineering Field Office, 5500 Hollywood, Los Angeles, advised that he knew of no experimental aircraft being flown by any manufacturers in this area on the date in question. He stated that practically all USAF experimental aircraft would be under his cognizance and he knew of none being flown on this date.

8. Special Agent BEDFORD M. LEAKE interviewed Major KENNETH T. BROOKS, Detachment Commander, U.S. Weather Bureau, Long Beach, California. He claimed that a weather balloon is released by his station at 5:00 am daily and that this balloon was released on the morning of 23 September 1951 and that, due to mechanical difficulties, contact with the balloon was lost at 12,900 feet per minute and was traveling toward the general North, Easterly, and was lost from sight.

Lighter than air direction:
Sighting 9:20 p.m. 6 September 1951 - OLIVER A. WAGGONER, Forecaster at the Long Beach Weather Station, reported that a balloon could not have been more than eight miles from point of observation, since the balloon was observed at the time his office closed.

10:20 - Major BROOKS said that this balloon at 33,000 feet would be about 20-24 miles from the Long Beach Station, and would be over the ocean, some 20 miles off the Long Beach shore.

11:20 - As approximate 7 x 5 x 9 inches white, glossy cardboard box was received in a small, white, glossy cardboard box approximately 13 x 8 x 4 inches under cover of Registered Mail addressed to MR. T. R. NELLON, General Services Meteorologist, Hancock Field, Santa Maria, California, and his advise was that it contained photographs further balloons on 23 September 1951, and on-and-off again on 22 September 1951. (CCY pas time, 22 September 1951) and was released at 1522 hours (0705 Zulu Time, 22 September 1951) which was relieved to be related to this matter.

The standard procedure to be followed on any incident of this nature requires:
1. That the course of the balloons would depend upon the wind velocity and the altitude of the balloons, that the observation as to the objects traveling in a southwest direction, which was the case of Santa Maria, which is 175 miles North and West of Long Beach, and is south to Long Beach. That the balloon of 50,000 feet was the same as the one observed.
2. Special Agent THOMAS MC ARDLE was advised by Lt. Commander Dr. C. WEST, Weather Station Officer, to the effect that his station on 23 September 1951 released a balloon which attained an altitude of some 60,000 feet before it burst. San Diego is approximately 150 miles south of Long Beach.
3. All of the above weather officers stated that there was no possible
ability that the 24-58 object sighted were any of these balloons which had been released, however each stated that it was determined that this was identified as a project balloon.
4. This matter was coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Los Angeles, The Office of Naval Intelligence in Los Angeles, and the Counter Intelligence Corps, Fort MacArthur, California. None of these agencies had received any information indicating any identification or relation to this matter.
