CONFIDENTIAL EXTRACT STATE REPORT 2

Appendix IV

MARCH AFB PROC. BASE - 23 September 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT

The first report of this incident, which appeared in Status Report No. 1, proved to be incomplete and misleading. Further investigation has corrected the discrepancies and the following account of the incident is considered to be accurate.

At approximately 0700 PCST, two F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George Air Force Base, California, on a routine mission. The flight was vectored to 110° 40' - 53° 20'N by GCI. (See enclosed overlay.) The first aircraft at approximately 17,000 ft. was in a holding pattern at 17,000 ft. The flight reported to GCI that they observed an unidentified object at this time. The flight was 30 seconds out of long-range radio at this time. The object appeared to be in a left orbit at about 55,000 ft. The object could not be picked up by the ground radar, however, visual contact was maintained. The object continued a left orbit and passed over the two aircraft. Attempts were made by the F-86's to identify the object but they were unsuccessful due to the altitude of the object and a fuel shortage. At approximately 0210 or 0210 MST, the aircraft was released by the ground controller and they returned to George Air Force Base. The object appeared to be an aircraft with 160 swept wing and bright silver in color. When last seen the object was in a left orbit, or circling to the left. The pilots opined that it was a swept wing type aircraft.

At approximately 0800 PCST four additional F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George AFB to relieve the two above mentioned F-86's. The four aircraft split into two, two-ship elements, denoted as Flight A-1 and A-2 on the enclosed overlay. Flight A-1 was vectored to a position at 117° 30', and 30° 30'N. They arrived at this position at approximately 0210 and sighted the object at approximately 0210 over 110 AR. A steady climb was made to 25,000 ft. and the object was found to be near March AFB. The object appeared to be in a controlled orbit to the right and left at 35,000 to 55,000 ft. The two aircraft stayed in the area for 10-15 min. The object was seen breaking off the intercept due to a fuel shortage and lander at 0645 MST. The object appeared to be a swept wing aircraft.

The second element of the group, noted as Flight A-2 on the overlay, observed the object soon after take-off. The object appeared to rotate south. The flight made a series of climbing turns under the object as they climbed to 25,000 ft. At approximately 10-5 PACST, the aircraft broke off the attempted intercept and returned to their base. This flight reported that the object appeared to be round and silver.

No more intercepts were attempted. At no time was the object observed on the radar screen nor was it reported to be observed visually from the ground. The F-86's, however, were continually traced by radar.

UNCLASSIFIED

I. The F-86's were unable to climb to the estimated altitude of the object due to the fact that they were carrying external fuel tanks and elect not to jettison them.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

At 0700 PST a radiosonde balloon was released from the Long Beach Municipal Airport. This balloon was lost at 0747 PST, eight miles from the airport on a bearing of 95° true, due to a malfunction of MK tracking equipment. (see point A on overlay.) A this time the balloon would have been at approximately 40,000 ft. The wind above 40,000 ft. are unknown but it is logical to assume that at this altitude they will be relatively constant in direction. Assuming a relative constant direction of 270° and an average velocity of 70 knots above 40,000 ft. (the wind at 40,000 ft. was 280° at 4 knots) the possible flight path of the balloon can be plotted on the overlay.

The original sighting by Flight 1 could very possibly have been the balloon as their heading was toward Long Beach airport. The altitude of the F-86's at the time of the sighting is unknown but probably below 40,000 ft. at 375°, the time of the original sighting, the balloon would have been at 50,000 ft. and approximately ten miles directly ahead of the two aircraft. The apparent orbit of the balloon cannot be explained. The balloon would make a gradual turn due to wind shifts but these are not significant if it is doubtful if the movement would be apparent from an aircraft as fast as an F-86.

Referring to the ground track of Flight 2-A, if a 30 knot wind at 270° is assumed, at 0610, the northing component of Flight 2-A is shifted the object. The balloon would be at B or the overlay. The balloon would probably be at an altitude of 65,700 ft. and nearly straight ahead of the aircraft, due to the size of the yellow, the witness could have highlighted and the balloon could have appeared to be near three. Once again the orbiting of the object cannot be explained.

The attempted intercept by Flight 2-B cannot be explained. If the ground track given by the leader of Flight 2-B is correct it is very doubtful that the flight was observing a balloon. The time that they sighted the object is not known but if it is assumed that they flew beneath the object for 7 minutes, it is highly doubtful that a wind shift of nearly 360° could occur above 60,000 ft.

The possibility of this object being an experimental aircraft from some southern California aircraft plant, naval airfield, or from Edwards Air Force Base was checked with negative results. No other balloons were released in the vicinity.

III. CONCLUSIONS

With the information available, it cannot be concluded that the object was definitely the radiosonde balloon released from Long Beach Municipal Airport. However, since the balloon was near the flight path of two of the F-86 elements, and assuming that the orbit was an illusion of relative motion between the balloon and the aircraft, it can be concluded that the unidentified object was very possibly a radiosonde balloon.

The third attempted intercept, the one in which the object was followed in wide turn, cannot be explained.

It is not believed that further interrogation would produce any additional significant details due to the fact that some of the personnel involved have been transferred overseas and the time since the incident.

MARCH AFB - 23 September 1951

On 23 September 1951 at 0310 PST, an unidentified object was sighted over Long Beach, California. Four F-86 aircraft were searchable and the object was sighted by them over Morro, California. On at rising an altitude of 13,000 ft., the F-86's reported the object to be traveling at an estimated altitude of between 30,000 ft. and 55,000 ft. The object appeared to be a swept wing, fighter type aircraft.

Weather
Unavailable at this time.

Evaluation
Radiosonic balloons were released from San Diego, Long Beach and Santa Maria, California at approximately 0700 PST. All of these weather stations were checked by OSI personnel and altitude; the balloons were released all weather station personnel stated that it would be very difficult at their balloons would have traveled the course that the object traveled.

All of the major aircraft factories and installations conducting experimental flight tests were contacted. No experimental aircraft airborne at the time of sighting.

Additional information has been requested as to additional details of the incident such as times and locations during the attempted interception by the F-86's and other possible balloon launchings.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

CG 27th Air Division (Def), Norton AFS, California

The enclosed report was received by Captain J.R. STEELE, Chief Controller, from Major LEO MELZER, Operations Officer, 750th ACM Squadron. The report was read back and verified by Major MELZER.

Major MELZER checked Edwards AFS Flight Dispatcher and Control Tower Operator regarding aircraft from Edwards AFS. In flight, No. 1 or conventional aircraft had been off from Edwards AFS. The Operations Officer confirmed that no experimental aircraft to his knowledge were scheduled for flight. Edwards AFS Flight Dispatcher checked Nellis AFB, Hawthorne, and George AFB reported no flight had been airborne at the time that would approximate descriptions given.

Major MANUSSIER, CO of the 750th ACM Squadron, asked General BOYD, CG of Edwards AFS, whether he knew of any flight to which General BOYD replied in the negative. General BOYD suggested that N.A.C.A. Los Angeles International Airport be checked. Major MELZER checked Bell Aircraft, N.A.C.A., Douglas, North American and Northrup, but only an IF at Northrup answered any of these calls and reported that there had been no activity all morning. Bell was then comparing with X-1 and X-5, N.A.C.A. with the XP-92, Douglas with the D 558, and Northrup with the X-5.

Edwards AFS Weather Station reported that Santa Maria, San Diego and Long Beach are regularly scheduled to release weather balloons which can easily rise to 50,000 feet and can expand "like a house" if they are 350 gram balloons. Balloons released by Santa Maria usually drift over Long Beach and Riverside, the flight that was reported as sighted. A kite may be staked to the balloon, an F-86 and may give off reflection.

Major MELZER also spoke to Captain HARVEY, one of the pilots who sighted the object (see enclosed statement), who stated the object appeared to be orbiting when he-sighted it and not going "too fast." This was in the March AEA area.

STATEMENT

23 September 1951

On 23 September 1951 at approximately 0810 ST a beige was sighted about 50,000 feet over Long Beach. I, Captain James H Harvey and my flight of four were dispatched by Kill Deer to investigate this beige.

When we sighted this beige he appeared to be over Muroc. When we reached an altitude of 43,000 feet this object was in the vicinity of March Air Force Base.

From 43,000 feet this beige appeared to be between 50,000 and 55,000 feet and also appeared to be a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft.

He was also noted to be in a constant orbit.

INCIDENT - 23 September 1951

On 23 September 1951 at 0810 PST, an unidentified object was sighted over Long Beach, California. Four F-86 aircraft were scrambled and the object was sighted by them over Luoro, California. On attaining an altitude of 43,000 ft. the F-86's reported the object to be swiftly moving from NW to SE, an estimated altitude of between 70,000 ft. and 75,000 ft. The object appeared to be a swept wing, fighter type aircraft.

Weather
Prevailing at the time.

Status of Investigation

Rawinsondes balloons were released from San Jose, Long Beach and Santa Maria, California at approximately 0700 PST. All of these weather balloons were released at altitudes that would raise the object in question. Weather conditions were normal. The balloons would have traveled in a course that the object traveled.

All of the major aircraft factories and installations contacted during experimental flight tests were contacted at the time of the sighting. No experimental aircraft airborne at the time of the sighting.

Additional information has been requested as to additional details of the incident such as times and locations during the attempted interception by the F-86's and other possible balloon launchings.

TITLE: Sighting of Unidentified Object Over Long Beach, California
ON: 23 September 1951

CHARACTER OF: SPECIAL INQUIRY

REFERENCE: Msg to Hqs OSI, dated 26 October 1951

The Commanding General, 27th Air Division, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, California, requested an investigation concerning the sighting of an unidentified object over Long Beach, California, on 23 September 1951. The object was sighted at 0810 hours at 50,000 feet. Four F-86's were dispatched to investigate and sighted object over Morse, California. Attaining an altitude of 43,000 feet, the F-86's reported object to be in constant orbit in the vicinity of March AFB, California, at an altitude between 50,000 and 55,000 feet. Object appeared to be a swept wing fighter type aircraft. A check with aircraft manufacturers in the Southern California area revealed that none had scheduled test flights of experimental aircraft on the date the object was seen. Weather balloons are released by three weather stations in Southern California, which rise to a height in excess of 50,000 feet. It was found that all three of these stations released a balloon on the morning of 23 September 1951. The operators of these stations added that there was a possibility that the object sighted was one of the balloons which had been released just prior to the time this object was reportedly seen.

DETAILS:

1. The investigation of this matter was predicated upon a letter from the Commanding General, Headquarters, 27th Air Division, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, California, dated 22 October 1951, requesting this District Office to make an investigation concerning the sighting of an unidentified object over Long Beach, California, on 23 September 1951.

2. At the time this matter was referred to this office, the 27th Air Division furnished an Intelligence Report which sets forth the following information:

"At 1610Z, 23 September 1951, an object was sighted and reported over Long Beach, California, at 50,000 feet. Four (4) F-86 were dispatched to investigate and sighted object to be in a constant orbit in the vicinity of March Air Base, California, at an altitude between 50,000 feet and 55,000 feet. Object appeared to be a saucer-shaped object."

"Santa Maria, San Diego and Long Beach are regularly scheduled to release weather balloons which occasionally rise to 70,000 feet. They have a kite attached that can give off reflection, and can expand greatly if they are 350 gram balloons."

3. The inclosed report was received by Captain J. R. STEELE, Chief Controller, ATOC, from Major John MELZER, Operations Officer, 706th ACWS Squadron. The report was read back and verified by Major MELZER.

"Major MELZER checked Edwards AFB Flight Dispatcher and Control Tower Operator concerning aircraft from Edwards AFB in flight. No net or conventional aircraft had been over from Edwards AFB. The Operations Officer confirmed that no experimental aircraft to his knowledge were scheduled for flight. Edwards AFB Flight Dispatcher checked Nellis AFB, Inyo, and George AFB Operators and reported that no flight had been airborne at the time that would approximate descriptions given."

"Major MANUSCER, CO of the 706th ACWS Squadron, stated that BOYD, CO of Edwards AFB, which is known of any flight to which General BOYD replied in the negative. General BOYD suggested that North American Company at Los Angeles International Airport be checked. Major MELZER checked Bell Aircraft, N.A.C.A., Douglas, North American and Northrup, but only an MP at Northrup answered any of these calls and reported that there had been no activity all morning. Bell has been experimenting with X-1 and X-5; N.A.C.A. with the D-558; and Northrup with the X-3."

Edwards AFB Weather Station reported that Santa Maria, San Diego and Long Beach are regularly scheduled to release weather balloons which can easily rise to 50,000 feet and can expand "like a house" if they are 350 gram balloons. Balloons released by Santa Maria usually drift over Long Beach and Riverside, the flight that was reported as sighted. A kite may be attached to the balloon as a "sounding set" and may give off reflection.

"Major MELZER also spoke to Captain HARVEY, one of the pilots who sighted the object (see enclosed statement), who stated the object appeared to be orbiting when he sighted it, and, not going, Mach .9".

This was in the March AFB area.

STATEMENT                                                   23 September 1951

"On 23 September 1951 at approximately 0810 ST a bogie was sighted about 50,000 feet over Long Beach. I, Captain James H. Harvey and my flight of four were dispatched by Kill Deer to investigate this bogie. When we sighted this bogie he appeared to be over Mhco. When we reached an altitude of 43,000 feet this object was in the vicinity of March Air Force Base.

"From 43,000 feet this bogie appeared to be between 50,000 and 55,000 feet and also appeared to be a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft. He was also noted to be in a constant orbit.

3. The Air Defense Command suggested the possibility that this object was an experimental aircraft which was being test flown for one of the aircraft manufacturing concerns located in this area.

4. From the information set forth above, it will be noted that this object was first sighted over Long Beach. The F-86's, after being dispatched to investigate, sighted the object over Mhco, California, which is some 100 miles due North of Long Beach. Captain HARVEY, the flight leader, said that when the F-86's attained an altitude of 43,000 feet, the object was sighted in the vicinity of March AFB, The March AFB is some

125 miles South and East of Muroc. Therefore, after being first sighted, the object appeared to travel the North for some 100 miles and then South-east for approximately 125 miles.

5. Special Agent ARTHUR J. WAIKOSKI made inquiry at the following aircraft companies in an effort to determine if they were test flying any experimental aircraft on 23 September 1951:

Northrop Aircraft Company
Hawthorne, California

North American Aviation, Inc.
Inglewood, California

Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc.
El Segundo, California

Lockheed Aircraft Company
Burbank, California

Hughes Aircraft Company
Culver City, California

It was found that none of these companies was test flying "experimental" aircraft on the date this object was seen. The above companies are under contract to build aircraft for both the U. S. Air Forces and U. S. Navy.

6. Special Agent THOMAS J. McARILE made inquiry at the Consolidated Vultes Aircraft Corporation, San Diego, California, and they advised that, although they were presently working on experimental aircraft, they did not have a flight scheduled for 23 September 1951.

7. Colonel G. E. JACKSON, Air Force Engineering Field Office, 550 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, advised that he knew of no experimental aircraft which was being test flown on the date this object was seen. He stated that practically all USAF experimental aircraft are test flown at Edwards AFB, Muroc, California. In this respect, it will be noted that the 27th Air Division made inquiry at Edwards AFB and they reported that no experimental aircraft was scheduled for flight on 23 September 1951.

8. Special Agent MEDFORD M. LEAKE interviewed Major KENNETH T. BROOKS, Detachment Commander, Weather Division, Long Beach AFB, Long Beach, California. He claimed that a weather balloon is released by his station approximately every six hours. He said that his records show that one was released between the hours of 0645 and 0745 on the morning of 23 September 1951 and that due to mechanical difficulties, contact with the balloon was lost at 12,900 feet. The rate of ascent of this balloon was 1000 feet per minute and was traveling in a general North Easterly and

later Westerly direction.

9. Lt. OLIVER A. WAGGONER, Forecaster at the Long Beach Weather Sta-
tion, advised that, in his opinion, the balloon could not have been more
than eight miles from point of release. At Long Beach at the time his office
lost contact with it.

10. Major BROOKS said that this balloon at 43,000 feet would be about
20 feet in diameter and the size, and shape would be determined by the wind
current and the wind speed. Twenty feet, below the balloon on a cord is
attached a red paper parachute which is connected to a radio transmitter
encased in a small white glossy cardboard box approximately 11 x 8".

11. Special Agent HENRY O. CHAPPEL interviewed Mr. P. R. NELSON,
General Services Meteorologist, Hancock Field, Santa Maria, California,
and he advised that his station released two weather balloons on 23 Septem-
ber 1951, One was released at 0900 hours (1930 hours Pacific Standard
Time, 22 September 1951), and one was released at 1505Z hours (0705 Paci-
fic Standard Time, 23 September 1951). The one which was released on 22
September 1951 attained an altitude of 78,000 feet and was contacted for
68 minutes by radio. The one which was released on 23 September 1951 re-
mained in the air 74 minutes and attained an altitude of 100,000 feet. He
said that the course of the balloons would depend upon the wind velocity
and that the average winds from Santa Maria are traveling in a Southeast-
erly direction. He stated that in his opinion the balloon which was a de-
scription of the balloon at an altitude of some 50,000 feet was the same
as that furnished by Major BROOKS.

12. Special Agent THOMAS McNERNY was advised by Lt. Commander D. C.
WEST, Weather Station Officer, Naval Air Station, San Diego, California,
that his station released a balloon at approximately 0700 hours PST on
23 September 1951. He claimed that the balloon attained an altitude of
some 60,000 feet before it burst. San Diego is approximately 150 miles
South of Long Beach.

13. All of the above weather officers stated that there was a possi-
bility that the object sighted was one of the balloons which had been
released, however each stated that it was doubtful because of the course
which the sighted object reportedly traveled.

14. This matter was coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, Los Angeles, The Office of Naval Intelligence in Los Angeles, and
San Diego, and the Counter Intelligence Corps, Fort MacArthur, California.
None of these agencies had received any information relative to this matter.

1. Reference is made to AF Form 112, #1, dated 5 Oct 1951, subject "High Flying Unidentified Object", in which the incident of an unidentified object over March Air Force Base on 22 Sept 1951 is reported.

2. The possibility of this object being a weather balloon released from San Diego, Long Beach, or Santa Maria or that it was an experimental aircraft was considered. It is highly doubtful if the object was a balloon, and it was not an experimental aircraft. Consequently, further investigation of the incident is warranted.

3. It is requested that the following information be obtained as soon as possible and forwarded to Chief, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Attn: ATZLA-2c, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.

    a. From what location was the original sighting of the object made? The report states that it was sighted over Long Beach. How was it located, visually or by radar?

    b. From what base did the F-86's take off? What was the time of take-off?

    c. The report states that the object was first sighted by the F-86's over March, which was the time and location of the F-86's at the time of this sighting? How did they determine the object was over March?

    d. The report states that when the F-86's reached an altitude of 43,000 ft, the object was over March Air Force Base. Did the F-86's have objects during its own sighting from March to March Air Force Base?

MARCH AIR FORCE BASE - 23 September 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT

The first report of this incident, which appeared in Status Report No. 1, proved to be incomplete and misleading. Further investigation has corrected the discrepancies and the following account of the incident is considered to be accurate.

At approximately 0700 PDST, two F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George Air Force Base, California, on a routine mission. The flight was vectored to 116° AC1 - 53° 50'N by GCI. (See enclosed overlay.) The flight orbited the position and was at a heading toward Long Beach. At approximately 0715 PDST the flight reported to GCI that they observed an unidentified object high at 12 o'clock. The flight was 30 seconds out of Long Beach radar at this time. The object appeared to be a left orbit and was picked up by the ground radar, however, visual contact was maintained. The object continued a left orbit and passed over the two aircraft. Attempts were made by the F-86's to identify the object to the ground controller at this altitude of the object, and a fuel shortage. At approximately 0210 or GCI the flight was released by the ground controller and they returned to George Air Force Base.

The object appeared to be an aircraft with .45° swept wing and bright silver in color. Then last seen the object was in a left orbit, or climb, to the left. The pilot's opinion was that it was a swept wing type aircraft.

At approximately 0800 PDST four additional F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George AFB to relieve the two above mentioned F-86's. The four aircraft split into two, two-ship elements, denoted as Flight ~A and ~B in the enclosed overlay. Flight ~A was vectored to a position at 117° 30' and 30" 01". They arrive at this position at approximately 0810 and sighted the object high at 1 o'clock at that appeared to be over three NE. A steady climb was made to 25,000 ft. and the object was found to be near 17,000 ft.

The object appeared to be in a controlled orbit to the right and left at 50,000 to 55,000 ft. The two aircraft stayed in the area for 10-15 minutes before breaking off the intercept due to a fuel shortage and landed at 0645 PDST. The object appeared to be a swept wing aircraft.

The second element of the group, noted as Flight ~B on the overlay, observed the object soon after take-off. The object appeared to be a plain white. The flight made a series of climbing turns near the object as they climbed to 25,000 ft. The object was in a wide right turn, at approximately 90° just the aircraft broke off the attempted intercept and turned to their base. This flight reported that the object appeared to be round and silver.

No more intercepts were attempted. At no time was the object observed on the radar screen nor was it reported to be observed visually from the ground, the F-86's, however, were continually tracked by radar.

1. Reference is made to your letter AFCIN-ATIA-2c dated 28 November 1951. In compliance with your request, the following information is submitted in answer to the questions contained in paragraph (3) of your letter.

a. Original sighting of object was made visually at 0715 PST from position over Santa Monica Bay as indicated on attached map overlay.

b. Element making original sighting took off from George Air Force Base at 0700 PST.

c. Reports that object was directly over Marse and March Air Force Base were apparently in error, resulting from the difficulty of making a land fix at high altitude. (Based on later interrogation of pilots by DI of First Fighter-Interceptor Wing, when reports indicated both sightings at the same time.)

d. Paragraph 1 c above applies.

e. Norton Air Force Base and March Air Force Base were oriented as to the launching of any type balloon, or any other object during the night. They have had the appearance of the object in question, from those bases. Norton Air Force Base replied in the negative; March Air Force Base has not replied to date, and their reply will be forwarded to your headquarters immediately upon receipt. However, the orbit of the object, as compared with the prevailing winds indicated, seems to preclude the possibility of the object being a free balloon.

1. Captain Harold E. Guthrie States: "On the 23rd of September 1951 while on F-86F (A/C in a flight at George Air Force Base at 0800; 23 September, 1951 for a scramble interception of an unidentified bogie over the Los Angeles area. At approximately 0810 I sighted an unidentified object over San Antonio PSR California, (117 degrees 40' W-34 degrees 20'N) in a level flight at 10,000 feet altitude, moving South. This object appeared to be travelling at a slow speed. It was oval shaped with a silverish color, like aluminum. At his level flight path orbiting with, the flight attempted to intercept; however, at 43,900 feet altitude we broke off because of low fuel. Object sighted was still above us.

2. What action did you take with NORAD when you observed this?
A. Kill Deer was contacted and informed of our low fuel level.
Q. Did Kill Deer acknowledge your message?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you hear any further alerts being directed by Kill Deer?
A. No.
Q. What time was this?
A. Approximately 0925.
Q. Did you see any other military A/C in the vicinity?
A. None.
Q. Were you in radio communication with any other military A/C in the vicinity?
A. No.
Q. Who else, in your particular flight, observed this object?
A. Captain Harvey, Major Buchanan(transferred to Korea), and Captain Caldwell(also now in Korea).
Q. What was the nature of your discussion/action, when the object was sighted?

11 December 1951

1. On 23 September 1951 at approximately 0810 ST a bogie was sighted.
About 50,000 feet over Long Beach. I, Captain James E. Harvey and my
flight of four were dispatched by Hill Deer to investigate this bogie.

When we sighted this bogie he appeared to be over Aurora. When we
reached an altitude of 43,000 feet this object was in the vicinity of
March Air Force Base.

From 43,000 feet this bogie appeared to be between 50,000 and
55,000 feet and also appeared to be a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft.
He was also noted to be in a constant orbit.

2. Q. When you were Vectored by the Long Beach area, were you able to
fix your position?
A. Yes, at approximately 117° 30 & - 33° 20 N.

Q. Did you see this object?
A. Yes.

Q. What position was it, in relation to you?
A. 1:15 and very high.

Q. What was your heading at that time?
A. 340° Compass heading. (Difficult to read clearly)

Q. Did you alert the rest of your flight?
A. Yes, I did.

Q. By what method?
A. Radio.

Q. Were you on the same comm. channel as Hill Deer?

Q. Did your flight Roger your information?
A. Yes they did.

Q. Were you sure Kill Deer read you also?
A. Yes, because Kill Deer knew of object.

Q. Did you question Kill Deer if they could read object on the scope?
A. I did not, but Captain Reichman did.

Q. Were you over Nurse at any time?
A. Negative.

Q. Did you attempt to intercept object?
A. Yes I did with my three companions.

Q. What happened, were you able to intercept?
A. No—because we had external tanks, and 12,000 feet was the highest we could get. Plus fuel shortage. If we had dropped our tanks, I believe we could have attained higher altitude.

Q. Did you ask permission to drop tanks?
A. No.

Q. Did Control instruct you to do so?
A. No.

Q. Did you lose sight of object at any time?
A. No.

Q. How long did you remain in area with object?
A. I don't know exactly, but at least 10 to 15 minutes. Not being able to climb higher, we broke off the intercept, because of the fuel shortage, and returned to base.

Q. Did Kill Deer release you, or what comm did you have with Control?
A. Yes, when informed of our position.

Q. Did Kill Deer inform you a new interception was in progress?
A. No.

UNCLASSIFIED

The F-86's were unable to climb to the estimated altitude of the object due to the fact that they were carrying external fuel tanks and elected not to jettison them.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

At 0700 POST a radiosonde balloon was released from the Long Beach Municipal Airport. This balloon was lost at 0742 POST, eight miles from the airport on a bearing of 95° true, due to a malfunction of the tracking equipment. (see point A on overlay.) At this time the balloon would have been at approximately 40,000 ft. The winds above 40,000 ft. are unknown but it is logical to assume that at this altitude they will be relatively constant in direction. Assuming a relative constant direction of 270° and an average velocity of 50 knots above 40,000 ft. (the wind) at 40,000 ft. was 280° at 1 knots) the possible flight path of the balloon can be plotted on the overlay.

The original sighting by Flight 1 could very possibly have been the balloon as their heading was toward Long Beach airport. The altitude of the F-86's at the time of the sighting is unknown but was probably about 40,000 ft. at 0757, the time of the original sighting. The balloon would be at 54,000 ft. and approximately ten miles directly ahead of the two aircraft. The apparent orbiting of the balloon cannot be explained. The balloon would make a gradual burn due to wind shifts but these are so gradual that it is doubtful if the movement would be apparent from an observer's standpoint.

Reaffirming to the ground trace of Flight 2-A, if a 90 knot wind at 270° is assumed, at 0810, the approximate time the F-86's sighted the object from a 355° to 0210, the balloon would be at B on the overlay. The balloon would probably be at an altitude of 65,000 ft. and nearly straight ahead of the aircraft, and to the size of the 1/100, the distance could have been reckoned and the balloon could have appeared to be near 1 acre. Once again the orbiting of the object cannot be explained.

The attempted intercept by Flight 2-B cannot be explained. If the ground track given by the leader of Flight 2-B is correct it is very doubtful that the flight was observing a balloon. At the time that they sighted the object is not known, but if it is assumed that they flew tentatively at 56,000 ft. for 20 minutes, it is highly doubtful that a wind shift of nearly 360° could occur above 60,000 ft. to give the illusion of a turn.

The possibility of this object being an experimental aircraft from some southern California aircraft plant, naval aircraft, or from Edwards Air Force Base was discussed with negative results. No other balloons were released in the vicinity.

III. CONCLUSIONS

With the information available, it cannot be concluded that the object was definitely the radiosonde balloon released from Long Beach Municipal Airport. However, since the balloon was near the flight area at the same time, and assuming that the orbiting of the object was an illusion due to the relative motion between the balloon and the aircraft, it can be concluded that the unidentified object was very possibly a radiosonde balloon.

A. Yes, it appeared, from angle we were at, to be directly over March A.F.Base.

Q. Any noticeable maneuvers?
A. No, just in orbit - varied between left and right.

Q. Would you say it was a controlled orbit?
A. Yes, it appeared to me the turn was held in. Very controlled.

Q. Did you hear March tower talk at any time?
A. No, I was on a different frequency.

Q. Can you describe the object?
A. It appeared to be a swept back wing, bright silver color. In size prospecting, it would fit within the radii of a gun sight.

Q. What altitude do you estimate object was at?
A. 50-55,000 feet.

Q. Your altitude at this time was 43,000 feet.
A. Yes, it was.

Q. That would indicate approximately 12,000 feet difference between you and the object?
A. Yes.

Q. What was the weather and visibility?
A. Clear and unlimited.

Q. In your own opinion Captain, what do you deduce it (the object) could have been?
A. It could have been a free balloon.

Q. Did you discuss this object with your co-pilots.
A. Yes. We were not quite definite, but it was an unidentified object.

1. Captain Omar J. Reichman states: On the morning of 28 29 September, 1951, I was one of an element of two that scrambled at approximately 0700 hours. The nature of this scramble was to intercept an unidentified object. We were vectored over Long Beach Bay, arriving there at 10,715 at approximately 30,000 feet. I was port orbit over position (118° 40'W-33° 50'N). I took up a Vector to Long Beach range at approximately 80° heading. At a period 30 seconds from Long Beach Range, I saw this object at 12 9/10 high above me. It appeared to be in a left orbit of an undeterrent speed, at above 50,000 feet altitude. It continued on a left orbit and passed directly over me, port to starboard. It appeared to have swept back wing of 45° and a very bright silver coloring--like sun reflecting on water. The proportion of the object seemed very far away.

2. Did the pilot of your element also see this object?
A. Yes. (Named Jack G. Ricolt, Captain). Now Fly MAXWELL FIA.

3. Did you attract his attention to the object?
A. Yes, I did.

4. Did you satisfy yourself he saw and recognized object pointing out?
A. Yes, I did.

5. How did you accomplish this?
A. Over the radio, V.H.F.

6. Is that on the same channel as Kill Deer?
A. Yes. I called this information into them. They boggered but they did not have object on the radar scopes.

Q. Could they, or was Kill Deer tracking you?
A. Yes.

Q. You are quite certain Kill Deer sighted you, but it could not have been your object?
A. Right. At the time I called in my position.

Q. What was your position at the time?
A. 30 seconds from Long Beach, heading 80 degrees. Probably 1 mi.

Q. Did you notice any maneuvers from this object?
A. No. It continued in a left orbit.

Q. Were you in vicinity of Muroc at any time?
A. I passed within 20 miles going out and returning. I did not see object there.

Q. Did you try to intercept it?
A. No. The shortage of fuel and altitude of the fuel prevented me from doing so.

Q. Are you positive Kill Deer was aware of object, and also of your fuel shortage?
A. Yes, they were, because they had vectored the next flight into the vicinity and released me.

Q. In your own opinion, what do you think the object could have been?
A. I am of the opinion it was an A/C of some sort, being in a state of burn.

Q. Have you discussed this object with anyone?
A. Yes, because of curiosity and attempting to resolve it. I also reported it on landing. Capt. Harvey made a written report.

Q. Did you lose sight of the object.
A. No. I left because of fuel shortage, and object was still in a port orbit; altitude approx. 50,000 ft.

The third attempted intercept, the one in which the object was followed in a wide turn, cannot be explained.

It is not believed that further interrogation would produce any additional significant details due to the fact that some of the personnel involved have been transferred overseas and due to the time since the incident.

1. The attached letter from Lt. Buzz Coleman requests information regard-
ing 14 sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

2. The following information regarding the sightings referred to in
Colonel's letter is provided to assist you in determining whether to take
the matter of the information under further consideration at this time.

3. The Laredo AFB, Texas, sighting which occurred on 4 December 1952 was
evaluated as an aircraft refueling.

4. At 1445 on 22 July 1952 the weather observer of the local airport at
Brenham, Texas, sighted an object which he described as being 20 to 25 feet
long, but displaying no conventional characteristics. The object appeared
to silver in color and appeared at 20 feet to an altitude of 20,000 feet. The observer estimated the object's speed as in excess
of 1000 mph. The object was a completely white object flying from northwest
to the southwest. The object was clocked as traveling at 1000 mph and was
in flight for 45 seconds. The object appeared to be climbing and disappeared
behind a large cumulus cloud.

This was in essence an unidentified flying object sighting. However, to
so small that an object so 20 feet long would be almost invisible at such
a distance. The available information is not sufficient to make a positive
identification of a conventional object or the cause of the sighting.

5. On 3 August 1952 at 1647 two objects were observed with binoculars
near Winslow, Arizona, California. The objects were described as metallic
and round, dark gray in color. They were estimated to be 20-100 feet in
diameter and traveling at an estimated speed of 400-450 mph. The objects
were at an altitude of 4000-450 mph. The color of the objects estimated to be 20,000 and 30,000
feet. The objects were in sight for 4-5 minutes.

Some text is legible, but much of the document is faint or blurry. Here is the text I can confidently read:

Large portions of the text are illegible or too faint to accurately transcribe. The document appears to be a report or communication related to an incident involving Air Force personnel and locations.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Note: Some parts of the text are partially illegible due to the image quality]

... Long Beach, California on July 20, 1951 ... 

(Patrick Air Force Base) ... on 25 July 1951 ... in the area of Northern Michigan on 30 July 1951 ...

The bottom of the page appears to have some text, but it is too faint and blurry to accurately transcribe. The majority of the text in the middle of the page is not clearly readable.
