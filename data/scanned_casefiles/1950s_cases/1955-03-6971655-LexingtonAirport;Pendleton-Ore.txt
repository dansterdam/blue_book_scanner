10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two (2) round, bright crimson objects seen three (3) minutes apart seemed to be as large a pinpoint held at arm length. Both objects seemed to disappear over the horizon heading due north. Both objects seen for a period of two minutes. Time of day night/dusk. Overcast. Nothing unusual noted on radar.

11. COMMENTS
Due to the fact that this sighting took place at an airport seems in itself to be of value. The fact that the sky is completely overcast seems to rule out astronomical, except for meteorites and a sighting of two minutes rules out that the objects must have been very large to appear as large as a pinpoint. A possible length of seeing local airport beacon seems to fill most of the requirements.
