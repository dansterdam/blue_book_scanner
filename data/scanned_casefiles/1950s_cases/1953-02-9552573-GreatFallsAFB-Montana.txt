The track was plotted to 30 mi of the station where it faded. In about five min. we picked it up again and carried the track out to 190 mi. After the track had faded for the last time we started picking up interference in the form of Running Rabbits for the rest of the night.

April 9, 1953

1st Lieutenant Bolt. Olsson
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear First Lieutenant:

Thank you for your letter and comments. I too think that we are getting someplace. This system of really reporting and investigating [partially illegible] will help us make a collection of the truly unknown cases with their follow ups so that a true scientific evaluation can someday be made. Heretofore there has been so much frustration. Although a follow up on critical points has been almost a little scientific value, I want to get to the bottom of the natural phenomena behind all this, if this is possible.

We should in time be able to set up some experiments to demonstrate these phenomena, and this will be the real proof of the pudding. This can come only be selecting proper cases and letting the majority of them go by the boards.

I hope that you will continue with this work and that we can have occasional meetings.

Well, here goes on this batch of 16 March. Of the 12 cases in this batch, 4 were without question Venus, and a 5th might have been. Two have in-sufficient data and 1 are now referring to the same incident seen to be worth a definite follow up.

Just for the record, the Venus cases were March 6 (Lewis Center), 5,10 and 11. Those of 6 Erie reports, and 7 March cases most probably to have been unknown light aircraft.

Now to those that are of some interest, the most important is 5 March, at Shaw AFB. Has the detailed report come yet? I should like very much to see this. I particularly wonder how the object could have speed 200 mph and still have been observed 1 hour. Very important here to establish identicalness of visual and radar sightings. Is this sighting of the same thing near Shaw AFB, but seen at Congress AFB a few hours later refer to the Great Falls, Mont. 27 for sighting? I am still checking previous report.

And finally, on 3 March, Luke AFB, was the 30 feet of gun camera film ever developed?

Question: Is it permissible to keep the typed copies of the TTY reports?

        Great Falls, Montana

1. Reference the sighting of an unidentified flying object by
radar at your station on or about 27 February 1953 witnessed by radar
personnel while monitoring local air traffic. In an attempt to uncover
a logical explanation for such observations, the Air Technical Intelligence Center has developed a questionnaire for sightings made by ground
radar which, when eventually completed by the radar technicians involved,
affords ATIC radar specialists with an adequate picture of the circumstances surrounding the contact.

2. ATIC would appreciate, therefore, the completion and forwarding
of the enclosed Electronics Data Sheet at your earliest possible convenience to ATIC with analysis of the subject sighting can begin.
