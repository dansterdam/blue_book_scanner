Conclusions:
The data, character, and contents from we obtained those time back a period. Possibly has been exceptionally permitted this test year (1957) - still no long reject.

1. Attached reports are forwarded for your review as possible indications of foreign missile activities, and therefore of interest to your division.

2. The characteristics, descriptions, and patterns in the report are those of a true bolide or "fireballs", an unusually large number with have been reported during the last year. However, this does not rule out the possibility of missiles.

3. The reason for submitting these is that within two months substantially the same objects, in the same area and within 30 miles of each other were reported by both the Air Force and the Navy. A rough plot of the direction of travel of one object (assuming the UFO to be a missile) indicates that the point of origin could be the northernmost point of the Sakhalin. A plot of the other also indicates that the point of origin could be in the same general area, although the direction of travel is in another direction, proceeding on the same assumption.

4. Your comment by reply hereon would be appreciated.
