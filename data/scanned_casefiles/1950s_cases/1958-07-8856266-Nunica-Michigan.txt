MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, LEGISLATIVE LIAISON, SAFIL
ATTENTION: Major Allen F. Will

SUBJECT: Letter from C/M Pucinski

Follows a draft of a suggested reply to Congressman Pucinski
referencing his letter from Mr. [redacted]

I refer to your recent letter concerning unidentified flying
objects from your constituent, Mr. [redacted]

A search of the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center's
UFO files reveals no case reported for Illinois on 4 November 1957,
nor is there a case for the area on the 3rd or 5th of November 1957.

The case referenced as taking place on 19 July 1958 actually
occurred on 20 July 1958. The object was sighted in the Crystal Lake
area of Illinois and was identified by the Aerospace Technical
Intelligence Center analyst as a balloon. The description of the
object, position of the sun, and wind vector substantiate the conclusion.

The sighting was made from an aircraft which was moving in the exact
opposite direction from the wind, and the high closure rate accounts
for the relatively short duration of the sighting. Other factors which
probably contributed to the lack of identification of this object were
the scattered clouds between the aircraft and object plus the fact that
the object was between the aircraft and the ground and therefore probably
blended into this complex background.

This sighting took place during the month of November 1957 which
recorded more UFO sightings than most years. (See attached press release.)

Memo for SAFOI, Subj: Letter from C/M Pucinski

Mr. [redacted] is a confirmed believer that space travel in reverse exists and we are being watched by intelligent beings from other planets. He believes that UFO's or popularly termed "flying saucers" are space ships.

We have had considerable correspondence with Mr. [redacted] on this subject and he has been informed on two or three occasions that the Joint Army-Navy-Air Force publication #146 is out of print and is too voluminous to copy. In this regard he is invited to visit this Office where he can read and copy this publication in whole or in part.

His request for Army publications should, of course, be directed to the Department of the Army and Mr. [redacted] should be informed that classified documents are not available.

SUBJECT: UFO Letter - Congressman R. G. Pucinski

TO: SAFOI-34 (Major Tucker)

1. A search of the ATIC UFO files reveals no case reported for Illinois on 4 November 1957, nor is there a case for the area on the 3rd or 5th of November 1957. It should be noted in Mr. _______ letter that-he-points out, the fact, that there was NO UFO reported to ATIC.

2. The case referenced as taking place on 19 July 1958 actually occurred on 20 July 58. The object was sighted in the Crystal Lake area of Illinois and was identified by the ATIC and local civilian sources. The description of the object, position of the sun, and wind vector substantiate the conclusion. The sighting was made from an aircraft which was moving in the exact opposite direction of the wind, and the high closure rate accounts for the relatively short duration of the sighting.

Other factors which probably contributed to the lack of identification of this object were:
- Scattered clouds between the aircraft and object.
- The object was between the aircraft and the ground and therefore probably blended into the complex background.

This sighting took place during the month of November 1957 which recorded more UFO sightings than most years. (See attached pages)
