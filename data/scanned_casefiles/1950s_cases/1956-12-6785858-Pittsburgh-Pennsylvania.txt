AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UFOB

DATE OF SIGHTING: 3 December 1956     PLACE OF SIGHTING: Shadyside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
                    Date of Report: 2 December 1956     Hq 54th Ptr Gru (AD), Gtr Pgh Apt, Pa.

SUMMARY: (Short summary in block letters)

7. Weather Conditions at Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania:
    a. Intermittent cloudiness, warm and damp
    b. Winds (Surface) - 250° - 15K, 5N, 270°, 40K; 60K; 20M, 300°, 85K; 10M, 280°, 100K; 15M, 280°, 70K
    c. 5,000 Feet
    d. 10 miles
    e. Overcast
    f. None

11. Assistant Operations Staff Officer. Immediately following the initial sighting, the local GCI station and airport control tower were contacted. Neither had radar contacts with any unknown object nor could verify the sighting by any in-flight aircraft. The observer at first believed phenomenon was caused by a search light, but since the beams were not visible on the lower layer, he is doubtful this possibility. The area is nearly populated for miles in every direction and it is very possible that the sighting could have been caused by a searchlight many miles from the area of sighting. There is little doubt that what was reported was seen but cannot be considered a qualified technical observer.

Observers:
a. Civilian - Mr. [redacted], Age - 27, Address [redacted], Occupation - Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. Wife also observed phenomena.

Distribution includes:
Commander, ADC, Ent AFB, Colorado Springs, Colorado
G. Commander, MATS, Stewart AFB, Newburgh, New York
