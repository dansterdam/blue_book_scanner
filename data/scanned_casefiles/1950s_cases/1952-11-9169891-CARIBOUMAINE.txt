STATEMENT OF T-6 PILOT

At 1728 E.S.T. on 4 November 1952 I was flying in the rear cockpit of a T-6, altitude was 2,500 feet, atmospheric conditions were clear. The weather station was reporting 1500 feet scattered and 4000 feet broken to overcast.

I observed a bright light as we were flying on a heading of approximately 360 degrees. Our position was this time was approximately 20 miles North of Presque Isle AFB. The light appeared as a 9 o'clock position, elevated approximately 25 degrees. Upon initial observation the light was white in color and appeared to be an aircraft position light. It soon became apparent that the light was not an aircraft position light but was moving or be stationary or moving very slowly. Its bearing was approximately 250 degrees.

From information AFB and approximately 2½ degrees from Presque Isle AFB, these headings were determined by turning the aircraft to point toward the light and reading the compass course.

The light descended toward the horizon and disappeared after having been under constant observation for a period of approximately 35 minutes. The color of the light changed from red to orange to blue-green to white. The sequence of color change was not recorded.

Later, I observed a star enter the haze layer and although its light was not as bright as the original light, it is reasonable to very much believe that the light I observed originally was a star or planet with the light refracted through the earth's atmosphere.

STATEMENT OF T-6 PILOT

On 4 November 1952 at 2230Z while flying a T-6 aircraft at 2,580 feet in the vicinity of Caribou, Maine I observed a bright light to the West just above a bank of low clouds. The light appeared to change colors from red to blue to white. I turned Captain Zegan who was flying with me, and asked him if he saw it too; he did. I then contacted the GOI controller at Caribou, Maine, and reported the situation to him. He claimed that he had no targets in that area (approximately 250° magnetic) from the city of Caribou. I flew about 40 (HO) miles in the direction of the light, and then returned.

I have no idea of the size, shape or altitude of the object except that it appeared approximately 100 above the horizon. I do not know how far away it was, or if it was moving.

STATEMENT OF SENIOR CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR, PRESQUE ISLE AFB, MAINE

I first came into contact with the strange light at 1736 L when a T-6 flying in an area local to Presque Isle arrived at the tower there to be west of the station there appeared to be a bright light at various colors. To me it appeared too large to be a star, and the color of red. I know an object could be a flare, but it appeared too large for that.

Northeast Airlines flight 12 coming into Presque Isle also observed the light, but later said it was probably only a star. Watching the time that I observed the light it disappeared and reappeared, several times; this time made no difference in was a star. For a while its movement, and then it appeared to move and change altitude very rapidly. I could in no way determine its altitude or distance from the station, but saw it first in the West, and then in the Northwest.
