Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

AT 1752 H., ON 9 NOVEMBER 1952, I WAS FLYING IN THE REAR COCKPIT OF A T-6 AIRCRAFT.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1753 H., THE PILOT, WHO WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT COMING FROM THE NORTHEAST, APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. THIS LIGHT WAS APPROXIMATELY 40-50 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A STEADY AND LEVEL FLIGHT AT AN ALTITUDE ESTIMATED TO BE 1,500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE WHITE IN COLOR AND APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATING OR REFLECTING A BRIGHT LIGHT.

THE PILOT IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE AIRCRAFT TOWARD THE LIGHT AND SPED UP THE AIRCRAFT'S ENGINES IN ORDER TO CLOSE IN ON THE OBJECT. AS THE AIRCRAFT APPROACHED TO WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 2,000 FEET OF THE OBJECT, IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION, LEAVING NO VAPOR TRAIL.

DURING THE INITIAL OBSERVATION OF THE LIGHT, IT WAS WHITE IN COLOR AND APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATING OR REFLECTING A BRIGHT LIGHT. THIS OBSERVATION LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS. THE PILOT STATED THAT WHEN HE TURNED THE AIRCRAFT TOWARD THE LIGHT AND SPED UP THE ENGINES, THE LIGHT APPEARED TO DIM SOMEWHAT, INDICATING THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN REACTING TO THE APPROACH OF THE AIRCRAFT. WHEN THE OBJECT ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED, IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH RATE OF SPEED THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

LATER, I OBSERVED A STAR NEAR THE HAZE LAYER, AND ALTHOUGH IT IS LIGHT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, IT IS MY OPINION THAT WHAT I OBSERVED WAS NOT A STAR NOR ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

DESCRIPTION OF T-6 PILOT
ON 8 DECEMBER 1952 AT 2302Z WHILE FLYING A T-6 AIRCRAFT AT 2,800 FEET IN THE VICINITY OF CAR-BOUN, MAINE, I OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT TO THE WEST THAT SHORTLY AFTER REMAINED STATIONARY AND THEN APPARENTLY ACCELERATED TO AN EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED IN THE DIRECTION OF CARIBOU, MAINE. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 1 TO 2 MILES HIGH AND I DID CONTACT IT. THEN CONTACTED THE CONTROL TOWER AND THEY STATED THAT THEY ALSO OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT MOVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED FROM THE CITY OF CARIBOU. I FLEW ABOUT FORTY (40) MILES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT AND THEN LOST CONTACT WITH IT.
I HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SIZE, SHAPE, OR ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT EXCEPT THAT IT APPEARED ON THE HORIZON AND MOVED RAPIDLY. I CANNOT ATTRIBUTE ANY POWERED CONTROLLED MOVEMENT TO IT AS IT WAS MOVING TOO FAST FOR A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

The text in the document is as follows:

STATEMENT OF SENIOR CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR, PRESQUE ISLE AFB, MAINE
1. While on the late contest with the 18th Tow Target Sq in 1956, I was observing the activity from the tower. At approximately 1800 hours I observed an unidentified light in the sky, south of the station, which appeared as an ascending light of the color of flaming magnesium. It rapidly gained altitude. The color was variable, being purple, blue, green and the colors of the cold flame type of magnesium. The light seemed to be oscillating and pulsating an average of 1 1/2 seconds. For approximately 10 seconds I observed the light, I would estimate its altitude at from 20,000 to 25,000 feet.

Northwest Airlines flight 12 coming into Presque Isle was observed during the time that I observed the light, and the light was in no way connected with the aircraft, as I also observed the aircraft separate and unconnected with the light.
I would in no way determine its attitude or distance from the station, but would say it was in the west, and some distance away. I attach no significance to the object, other than the fact that I observed it, and it was not of a nature that I could determine.
