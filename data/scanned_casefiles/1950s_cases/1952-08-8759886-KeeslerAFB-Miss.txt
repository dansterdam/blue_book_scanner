FORM 112—PART I
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: Report of Sighting of Unidentified Object
Location: Southeast Mississippi
Date of Incident: 11 August 1952
Date of Information: 19 August 1952

From: Wing Intelligence Office
Keesler AFB, Mississippi
Station: P-3

Major CARL H. FOWLER, JR., Intelligence Officer, USAF, with 1st Ind, Subj: "(Unclassified) Reporting of Information on Unidentified Flying Object"

1. At approximately 0210 hours, CST, 10 August 1952, [redacted] (observer) and [redacted] (witness) sighted two (2) unidentified flying objects in the sky west of their geographical position of 30°09'N/88°57'W. The objects were reported as being oval-shaped and approximately 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a full moon, and orange in color by the witness. The size of the objects was reported as being comparable to a penny held at arm's length. No identification as to height or distance was forwarded by the observer but the witness estimated the objects were at an altitude of approximately two thousand (2000) feet. Speed was estimated by both observer and witness in being approximately two hundred (200) miles per hour. No aerodynamic features were observed.

2. The period of observation was estimated at being five (5) to ten (10) seconds. The objects were first observed on an azimuth of 315° and turning in a north-northeast direction. The objects were reported as being very maneuverable and executed roaring turns to the left and right. No vertical movement was observed. After the five (5) to ten (10) second interval of observation had elapsed, the objects turned to a normal heading and disappeared from view behind buildings at approximately 150 azimuth. The observer and witness could distinguish sound or visible means of propulsion.
