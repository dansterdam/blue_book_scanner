AF FORM 112—PART 1

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

At 1945 on the 7 of October 1952 an unidentified object which appeared to be a light was sighted in the vicinity of Anderson AFB. A T-6 which was flying locally was directed to investigate the strange or this light. Prior to reaching the unidentified object, it disappeared.

A cursory check of navigational charts of the first magnitude at the time of sighting reveals nothing to have been out at an azimuth of 232 degrees and an altitude of 28 degrees 33 minutes.

No significance can be judged.

SUBJECT: Sighting of Strange Object (a/c) Flight

TO:     Provalen Intelligence Officer

1. The following report is submitted as a resume of the sighting of a strange object in the vicinity of Hickam AFB on 7 October 1952.

2. On the evening of seventh October I was on duty in the tower marking "A" position, the actual controlling of aircraft with the files.

3. The weather was I November, was 7/7 with an overcast at a very high altitude based on the local 1800. The only unusual flying at the time was a C-46 on a local flight alone.

4. About 2145 hours I was alerted to see a light, which I at once assumed to be an aircraft on about an eight to ten mile final bringing to vicinity the pilot of the 506 of an aircraft in transit. It was then when I noticed that the light as was not moving, this stationary. A 1 to 1.5 mile "B" was to go out on the platform around the field and look to identify it.

5. I contacted the Guam AFC Center below, the to or requesting to confirm almost certain was not for two beacons. Next I contacted the tower, they advised that they had nothing up at that time. Data was Anderson and Agana Center beacons with lights up at that time. I then contacted the pilot of the 506 who was in position of radio to land and asked him to check, which he did.

6. He advised that to him the light appeared to be thirty off miles and estimated the light to be 250 degrees. It was flying at 4,500 feet, been observing the object (or light) estimated 1-2 position, which was also been flying from their position in the same direction and heading, as to were observing; it. By this time and been contacted by several cells from different individuals who were also observing it.

7. I contacted tower personnel, and asked the dispatcher to have the

1958th AACS Squadron, 350.09, Subject: Sighting of Strange Object or Light

Pilot of the T-6 call me when he closed his flight plan. Lt. Cummings, the pilot, gave me his information, which I have entered in paragraph 6 above.

8. About 225 hours I again observed the light at a much greater distance with less intensity of light. It was soon gone from sight.

9. In the first appearance of the light, we observed it for about a half hour. The lost light intensity and slowly dropped in a vertical direction out of sight in a time period of about five minutes.

10. While observing the light I noticed that it slightly changed in color varying from a bright white to a yellowish orange then back to the white.

11. Individuals who saw the light were in Guam Control, Andersen Weather, Agana Tower, 3rd Aviation, Anderson Cross Crew, Anderson Base Operations, Andersen Tower and others from which 1 received phone calls.

12. I have been in Andersen Tower for six months but have never witnessed any similar occurrence.

13. I am convinced that the light was not any type of known aircraft, weather balloon, flare, meteor or star.

14. If this light was housed in any type structure I am unable to describe it.

15. Lt. Cummings, pilot of the T-6, called the tower on a second instance reporting that he had again seen an identical light to the south as he left Base Operations.

16. I received reports of other "strange lights" after the light in question was observed, but I believe them to have been only stars since I was unable to see it.

17. I am not an advocate of interplanetary "saucers" and in writing this report am only describing a strange occurrence which I witnessed and am unable to account for.

SUBJECT: Sighting of Strange Object or Light

TO:    Squadron Intelligence Officer

1. The following report is submitted as regards the sighting of a strange light or object in the vicinity of Anderson Air Force Base on the night of 7 October 1952.

2. At 1945 hours on the night of the seventh of October a lighted object was sighted over the approach end of the active runway, which was seven - flight*. The object being sighted from Anderson control tower about five to be only about five hundred feet high and not too far from our runway.

3. After careful study through the binoculars, A/3c Yawger and myself agreed that the object was stationary and had a slight color change from an orange to white. We also determined that the object could not be an aircraft or a balloon or even a weather tube at its stationary position.

4. We had a T-6 flying in the local area, his number being 147 and the pilot's name being Lt. Cummings.

5. We asked 147 if he had the object in sight. He verified our transmission and then we asked 147 if he would fly to the object and turn his landing lights on it, which he did and his statement was that the object was around 4,000 feet high and between 30 to 40 miles out to sea.

6. The pilot of 147 also did not know what it was and at 1940 hours the object started to descend and at 1945 hours the object had disappeared from our sight.

7. During that thirty minutes we had notified Agana tower, Control, Base Operations and COA. They all had the object in sight except COA. They said the object was too far for their scopes.

8. The above is what I remember of the incident.

10 October 1952

SUBJECT: Sighting of Strange Object or Light

TO: Squadron Intelligence Officer

1. The following report is submitted as regards the sighting of a strange object or light by the writer in the vicinity of Anderson Air Force Base on the night of 7 October 1952.

2. At approximately 1920 hours, I was asked by the tower operator in Anderson Control Tower if there was any traffic intended to Anderson Air Force Base at that time. As there was not, I was advised that there was a strange light that appeared to be approximately 10 to 15 miles southwest of the station and at a height of about 500 ft. I immediately went outside the Anderson Control (AACS) building, located directly under Anderson Control Tower, and confirmed that there was such a light appearing in the sky at the place indicated. The Control Tower operator confirmed this.

3. The light was approximately 250 Degrees from the Anderson Control Tower and from my position in front of the main Control building. The light was similar in appearance to a bright star but not very bright. The light remained in a very close to the station. The light appeared to change color around its perimeter. The center remained white but the perimeter appeared to change from white to red to orange and back to white. Two changes were noted successively. However, the red took on a bright red color. Not the red associated with the sun but much like a red light of an airport or automobile tail light. The light remained stationary for a period of time.

4. As long as the light remained in one spot it displayed the same inclination. As it moved in a downward direction, the increasingly horizontal movement was noted. I did not watch the downward movement to its conclusion at that time.

5. Before the light disappeared, several persons saw and confirmed my sighting. At this time the light appeared similar to a star but had a very peculiar movement. Various other agencies on the island of Guam were checked to try to determine if the light was locally produced. All agencies contacted could not explain the light. Very nearby Air Force installations were contacted to the direction from Andersen Air Force Base (240 Degrees) and appeared to be at the same general altitude (7 to 8 miles). The first sighting of the light was for a period of approximately 25 minutes.

6. Again at approximately 2230 hours, I was again advised by the Control tower operator that the light was again visible in the same general direction. I went outside and again confirmed that the light was as had been sighted.


- page 15 -

SUBJECT: Sighting of Strange Object or Light

This time the light was of a much less intensity and appeared to be a most distance away. The second appearance of the light was in a westerly direction ( 45 minutes ) and the movement was more pronounced in the city when regarded in reference to a stationary object. The light was very rapidly and suddenly dimmed and disappeared very shortly before reaching the horizon.

4. In the direction of the strange light, there were no stars visible and there was reported a high overcast which was visible in the light of the moon with a distinct 3°c centered over Guam, and extending to the horizon in a eastwardly direction. The overcast was reported at about 27,000 ft.

5. The light had no "shape" except that it was round. The size could be referred to in that it appeared to have a size similar to an automobile headlight as seen about 1 or 2 mile.
