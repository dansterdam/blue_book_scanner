(CLASSIFICATION)

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

5255th Combat Crew Training Wing
(PTG), Williams AFB, Arizona

Visibility - 40 miles
Wind at Cloud Cover - (1500 scattered)
Incident in Area - Possible landing of B-47 and B-36 during night flying exercise. Main observer of incident was a local civilian.

Interception Action - None

Location of Air Traffic in Area - Unknown

Position Title and Comments of Preparing Officer - Investigating Officer:
From 1930 to 2100, no flying activity was conducted by military or civilian aircraft in this area as far as could be determined. To weather balloons were released at this station.

It is possible a military aircraft on a classified mission could have been in the vicinity at this time. However, the CAA in Phoenix had no knowledge of such aircraft.

An interesting point was that the object was "in flight", however, much emphasis was placed on the ground observer's statement that the object was "hovering". The object was in general and not aircraft in particular was identified. Except for a few details, the observer seemed credible. However, trying to determine the exact course of the object, and asking various questions, both men became somewhat withdrawn and did not appear to be too interested in answering questions.

Existence of Physical Evidence - None
