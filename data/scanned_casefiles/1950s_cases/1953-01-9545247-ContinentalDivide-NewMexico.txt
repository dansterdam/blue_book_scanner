AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(1) Date and Time of Observation: 23 Jan. 1953
(2) Sighting Report: Oval, like a large burning flare, white to pale-red. 
(3) Manner of Disappearance: Went straight up, then moved rapidly westward, then seemed to turn and move north for several minutes before disappearing from view.

(5) Time of Observation: 25 January 1953, for 3 minutes (intermittently).
(6) Visual Observation: Bright, like a bright star, low on southwestern horizon.
(7) Airplane(s) or Astronomical Object(s) Unrelated: 7959A about 15' Continental Divide, New Mexico.
(8) Reliability considered excellent. (4/5 points, 4/5 color).
(9) Weather: High thin overcast, lower scattered clouds. Wind from 270° at 39 knots. Temperature 15-20°C. Visibility 15,000 feet.
(10) Radar Observation: Concurrently with visual observation.
(11) (9) and (10) all negative.
COMMENTS of Reporting Officer: Negative.
COMMENTS of Approving Officer: Negative.

Weather balloons are released daily at 0700Z (2000 MST) at points located near the Continental Divide in New Mexico. On 23 and 25 January 1953, 315 Springdale, east and 101 Wilcox, west, both had balloon releases on these dates. This might account for the sighting, since the balloon lightly illuminated would have the appearance described. This type of balloon would be visible only a short time as it ascended rapidly, then would disappear from view as it got beyond visual range.

The information given by the observer was such that the object sighted was less than a weather balloon under normal circumstances, yet the balloon could not be under normal circumstances be seen to ascend rapidly and move quickly over the horizon as described. The balloon could not under normal circumstances be seen as a large flare-like object for 3 minutes, and the radar observation was negative.

INCIDENT NO 6—On the night of January 25, 1953, a group of Civil Aeronautics Administration employees and security guards at the Continental Divide radar station, New Mexico, observed a very bright, reddish-white object moving erratically over the area. The object was first picked up on radar and then visually sighted. As the object moved behind a hill and then reappeared, radar showed it was traveling at a speed of 1,200 miles per hour to a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet. The object then stopped, hovered for a while, and then moved steadily almost directly into the wind.

UNCLASSIFIED
26 January 1953
Continental Divide, New Mexico

I. Description
On the 26 January at 2115 hrs Air Force personnel stationed at an ADC station in this area observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon high over the Continental Divide. The white object estimated to be from 60 to 100 feet long was traveling west of the radar site. The object appeared to be hovering and at slow speed. The airman making this visual observation reports that they had an excellent view and could see the object clearly.

The object was first picked up at a range of 12 to 15 miles west of the radar site. The object was under visual observation for most of the time that the radar recorded it. It was eventually lost on radar at the 10 mile range. The elevation of the object was 7,500 ft. above sea level.

Weither at the time was characterized by a high thin overcast and scattered clouds. Winds aloft were from 270 degrees at 30 knots at 10,000 ft.

II. Discussion
This is the most complete report ever received by ATIC on the sighting of an unidentified object. The sighting confirms the observations of the 24th Air Division, ADC, is to be supplemented on his initiative and compared to account for all of the nighttime sightings contained in visual-reconnaissance information. The sighting is the best type of sighting to work with because it offered the most information.

The intelligence officer preparing the report checked on weather balloon releases in the area. It was found that a nine pound balloon released from Roswell, Arizona, was under the only visible cloud motion in the area at the time of the sighting. Also the sighting time of 0412Z is one hour and 15 minutes after the visible Roswell balloon release and probably did not have any connection with the incident.

ATIC electronics specialists advanced the theory that the slow speeds observed and long gliding lines indicate the possibility of an astronomical solution such as a star or planet. Since the object was tracked at 12 to 15 mph aircraft are eliminated as a possibility.

The text in the document is as follows:

Continental Divide, New Mexico
26 January 1953

I. Description of Incident
On 26 January 1952 at 2115 MST Air Force personnel stationed at an AC&W station in this area observed an object in the sky. This object was seen visually and by electronic means. At the naked eye the object appeared as a very bright reddish-white object outlined to the naked eye. The object passed behind a hill and was not observed further. The object was observed by the station personnel to make a very erratic maneuver at high speed, appearing to zig-zag across the radar scope, appearing west of the station approximately 9 miles away. The object showed the object to be moving at a rate of 2,700 mph, a velocity of 10-15,000 feet per minute. It was eventually lost on radar at the 16 mile range. The object under visual and radar observation illuminated the sky to the horizon. The elevation of the station is 7,500+ above sea level. 
Weather at the time was characterized by high thin overcast and low scattered clouds. Winds aloft were from 270° at 30 knots at 10-20,000'. An atmospheric inversion layer existed at 12,000' with the top at 21,000'.

II. Discussion of Incident
This is the most complete report ever received by ATIC on the sighting of an unidentified object. The intelligence officers of the 29th Air Division are to be complimented on their initiative and complete covering of all the details regarding this observation. However, the conclusion drawn in this continental visual-electronic sighting is the best type of sighting to work with because it affords the most information.
The intelligence officer's estimate is that the report describes a weather balloon was reasonably explained as a possible answer to the sighting. It was found that a 9' 'radiosonde' balloon from Tularosa, Arizona, would offer the only possibility. The unknown object was observed to move from east to west, which aligns with the balloon trajectory. Also the sighting time of 0315 x 1 hour and 15 minutes after the window release and by that time it is probable that the radiosonde had burst. 
The fact that the object was detected on radar and seen visually for so long a period of time eliminates some astronomical solutions, such as a star or fireball, and especially if both radar and eye were seeing the same object. Since the object was tracked at 12 to 15 mph, aircraft are also eliminated as a possibility.
Some electronic specialists advanced the theory that the slow speed and large visual radar size of the target make it appear that weather effects may be the cause of the electronic pickup. However, the inversion layer at 12,000' appears to be too high to affect the radar which was tracking the object at 10-15,000'.
There is a possibility which ATIC is now checking.

According to the text in the image:

that the radar personnel may have been looking at the planet Venus, very low and bright on the western horizon at this time, and that the radar possibly encountered the aforementioned weather interference at the same time. This might result in a high degree of coincidence, however, and the radar and visual sightings seem to give much weight to the theory that the objects were maneuvering different objects.
Two other items added to the completeness of the report: ATIC supplied the reporting intelligence officer with a USAF Technical Information Sheet, or a visual questionnaire, and an Electronics Data Sheet covering the radar pick-up. Further analysis of this material might with authentic weather charts for the date of sighting establish this report as an unknown, carried in Project Blue Book's files as an unknown.
III. Conclusion
Unknown

The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

U.S too high to effect the radar which was tracking the object at 10-12,000 ft. The tracking effect was such a reduction of size as to render the visual sighting casually impossible. There is a possibility which aids to now checking that the sighting described may have been undoubtedly due to the natural phenomena called visual wind. This would account for the interferenc with the radar and visual sightings seen to coincide too exactly to give much weight to the theory that they were accompanied by physical disturbances.

Two other items added to the completeness of this report. ATIG supplied the sighting intelligence reports with a USAF Technical Information Sheet or a visual questionaire and an Electronics Data Sheet. Further analysis of this sighting awaits any limiting of sighting Blue Book files as an interim.

III. Conclusion:
DISAPPROVED FOR OPERATION

1. It is not possible to give a firm opinion as to the nature of the unidentified target. However, the slow speed and large visual radar size of the target suggested it was not a normal aircraft. Additional weather information - temperature gradient - would be of value in determining the possibility of low-level temperature clouds.
2. It is unfortunate that an interception was not attempted on this target as it was detected for forty-five minutes and moved slowly.
