SUBJECT: PINOBJPT

In accordance with AJL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: PINOBJPT), the following report of Unidentified Flying Objects is submitted:

On 26 January 1953, at 2115 MST, A/1c J.O. Dennis, stationed at 769th ACWN, Continental Divide, New Mexico, while on duty in the operations building, observed an aerial phenomenon as he stood outside the rear entrance door to the building. The object appeared as a very bright radiant white object approximately ten miles east of the radar site. The object passed behind a hill and reappeared apparently heading in a northerly direction at a very slow speed (at 10-15 mph). Airman Dennis reported this sighting to his crew chief, A/1c R.L. Welch, upon entering the operations building. Airman Welch and A/1c J.O. Dennis later contacted Airman Dennis and visually identified blip on the radar scope, sighting west of the station about 9 miles away.

The blip was appearing intermittently, moving slowly west of the site, early heading outbound from the radar site. Airman Welch went outside of the building to observe the phenomenon. The bright object appeared oval in shape, 10-12 miles away moving slowly northward. The bright object changed color from a very bright white to a dull, almost block-like lead. The object seemed to diminish in brightness and size before it faded from view. Airman Welch returned to the scope to observe the phenomenon. Welch made several trips outside to view the object visually during the period of radar observation. The object was under visual and radar observation intermittently for forty-five minutes. No other radar data available. The object was visually estimated to be 2,000 feet above the terrain. The radar estimate was 10-15,000 feet above MSL. The elevation of the 769th ACWN is approximately 7,500 feet above MSL.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:        Negative

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

    Weather balloons are released daily at 03004 (2000 MST) at points located near
    Phoenix, Saffs, Winslow, Ajo; January, Golo; Albuquerque, N. Mex; White Sands, T. Mex;
    Las Vegas, Nev; Big Springs, Tex; and El Paso, Tex. Winds aloft (10-30,000 ft.MSL)
    at the time of this observation were from 270° at 30 knots. Due to the direction of
    the winds aloft (about the same through Arizona and New Mexico) the only weather
    balloon likely to have been in the 769th AEWS area would be the balloon released
    at Winslow Airport on the hour and afternoon previous to the observation of the
    bright object. The balloon released at Winslow was approximately three feet in
    diameter at launching and expands to seven feet in diameter. Normally at 30,000
    feet MSL. Leaking balloons are not uncommon and could conceivably be carried some
    distance at low altitudes. Balloons released during the hours of darkness carry a
    flash light attachment. The flash light is standard size and is suspended from the
    balloon by a short lanyard cord.

    From the information given by the observers the object moved west then north
    for some time then southeast. If the winds given are correct this would mean the
    object moved against the wind, which is opposite the direction a free balloon would
    normally move. The balloon could not under normal circumstances be seen as a large

INCIDENT NO. 6-On the night of January 26, 1953, a group
of Air Force people stationed at a radar site in New
Mexico observed a very bright, reddish-white object west of
their station and then picked it up on their radar. The object
was in view for 15 minutes both visually and by radar and once
moved behind a hill and then reappeared. Radar showed it
9 miles from the station, traveling north at a lay 12 to 15
knots, at 10,000 to 12,000 feet. Although a balloon was in the
vicinity, the UFO traveled steadily almost directly into the wind.

UNCLASSIFIED

I.    Description

On 26 January at 2:15 MST Air Force personnel stationed at an AGM station in this area observed an aerial phenomenon simultaneously by electronic and visual means. To the naked eye the object appeared as a very bright reddish-white object estimated to be ten miles west of the radar site. The object passed behind a hill and then reappeared approximately heading in a northerly direction and at slow speed. The airman making this visual observation reported it to personnel manning the radar equipment. They stated that they had a visual contact bill on the radar scope, approximately nine miles away. The scope showed the object to be on a 270° azimuth at an altitude of 10-15,000 ft. moving away from the site at 12-15 mph. It was eventually lost on radar at the 18 mile range. The object was under visual and radar observation intermittently for 45 minutes. The elevation of the station is 7,500 ft. above sea level.

Weather at the time was characterized by a high thin overcast and low scattered clouds. Winds aloft were from 270° at 30 knots at 10-30,000 ft. An atmospheric inversion layer existed at 18,000 ft. with the top at 21,000 ft.

II.   Discussion

This is the most complete report ever received by ATIC on the sighting of an unidentified object. The Intelligence officer of the 39th Air Division, ADC, is to be complimented on his initiative and comprehensive angles bearing on the observation. Moreover, the combination visual-electronic sighting is the best type of sighting to work with because it affords the most information.

The intelligence officer preparing the report checked on weather balloon releases in the area of observation as a possible answer to the sighting. It was found that a nine ft. radiosonde balloon released from Winslow, Arizona, would offer the only possibility. The unknown object was observed to move from east to west, against the prevailing winds along the balloon theory. Also the sighting time of 04:52 is one hour and 15 minutes after the Winslow release and by that time it is probable that the radiosonde had burst at altitude long before.

The fact that the object was detected on radar and seen visually for so long eliminates the possibility of an astronomical solution such as a star or fireball especially if both radar and eye were seeing the same object. Since the object was tracked at 12 to 15 mph aircraft are eliminated as a possibility.

ATIC electronics specialists advanced the theory that the slow speed and large visual width of the target make it appear that weather effects may be the cause of the electronic pick-up. The inversion layer at 15,000 ft. appears to

Continental Divide, New Mexico                                                26 January 1953

I.    Description of Incident

On 26 January 1953 at 2115 MST Air Force personnel stationed at an AGW station in this area observed an aerial phenomenon simultaneously by electronic and visual means. To the naked eye the object appeared as a very bright reddish-white object estimated to be 10 miles west of the radar site. The object passed behind a hill and then reappeared apparently heading in a northerly direction at a slow speed. The airman making this visual observation reported to personnel manning the radar equipment. They stated that they had an unidentified blip on the radar scope, appearing west of the station approximately 9 miles away.

The scope showed the object to be on a 270° azimuth at an altitude of 10-15,000' moving away from the site at 12-15 mph. It was eventually lost on radar at the 18 mile range. The object was under visual and radar observation intermittently for 45 minutes. The elevation of the station is 7,500' above sea level.

Weather at the time was characterized by a high thin overcast and low scattered clouds. Winds aloft were from 270° at 30 knots at 10-30,000'. An atmospheric inversion layer existed at 16,000' with the top at 21,000'.

II.   Discussion of Incident

This is the most complete report ever received by ATIC on the sighting of an unidentified object. The intelligence officer of the 9th Air Division, ADC, is to be complimented on this initiative and complete coverage of all the angles bearing on the observation. Moreover, the combination visual-electronic sighting is the best type of sighting to work with because it affords the most information.

The intelligence officer preparing the report checked on weather balloon releases in the area of observation as a possible answer to the sighting. It was found that a 91 radiosonde balloon released from Winslow, Arizona, would offer the only possibility. The unknown object was observed to move from east to west, against the prevailing winds aloft which rules out the balloon theory. Also the sighting time of 0415 to 1 hour and 15 minutes after the Winslow radiosonde and by that time it is probable that the radiosonde had burst at altitude long before.

The fact that the object was detected on radar and seen visually for so long a period of time eliminates the possibility of an astronomical solution, such as a star or fireball, and especially if both radar and eye were seeing the same object. It is unlikely that these objects would cause radar returns. Since the object was tracked at 12 to 15 mph, aircraft are also eliminated as a possibility.

ATIC electronics specialists advanced the theory that slow speed and large visual radar size of the target make it appear that weather effects may be the cause of the electronic pick-up. However, the inversion layer at 16,000' appears to be too high to effect the radar which was tracking the object at 10 to 15,000'. The weather-effect explanation cannot, for the simultaneous visual sighting. There is a possibility which ATIC is now checking.



that the radar personnel may have been looking at the planet Venus, very low and bright on the western horizon at this time of year, and that the radar possibly encountered the aforementioned weather interference at the same time. This would require a high degree of coincidence, however, and the radar and visual sighting seem to coincide exactly to give much weight to the theory that both were observing different objects.

Two other items added to the completeness of the report. ATIC supplied the reporting intelligence officer with a USAF Technical Information Sheet, or a visual questionnaire, and an Electronics Data Sheet covering the radar pick-up.

Further analysis of this sighting awaits additional weather charts for the data and area of sighting and until this information is received, this report is carried in Project Blue Book's files as an unknown.

be too high to effect the radar which was tracking the object at 10-15,000 ft.
The weather effect explanation cannot, of course, account for the simultaneous
visual sighting. There is a possibility which ATIC is now checking that the
radar personnel may have been looking at the planet Venus, very low and bright
on the western horizon at this time of year, and the radar possibly encountering the aforementioned weather interference at the same time. This would
require a high possibility of coincidence, however, and the radar and visual
sightings seem to coincide too exactly to give much weight to the theory that
both were observing different objects.

SUBJECT: (Uncl) Radar Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object 17 March 1953

TO: ATIAC-5                FROM: ATIAC-2                DATE: 20 Mar 53                CONNECTION NO. 2

1. It is not possible to give a firm opinion as to the nature of the unidentified target. However, due to the slow speed and large visual radar size of the target (visually - a grapefruit hold at arm's length) weather conditions are suspected as the cause of the target. Additional weather information - temperature vs height - would be of value in determining the possibility of ice-laden clouds.

2. It is unfortunate that an interception was not attempted on this target as it was detected for forty-five minutes and moved slowly.
