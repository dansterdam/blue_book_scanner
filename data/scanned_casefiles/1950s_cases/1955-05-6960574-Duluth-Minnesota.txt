DISPOSITION FORM

FILE NO. | SUBJECT: Air Intelligence Information Report
TO: AFOIN-AEL, ATTN: Capt Hardin
FROM: WCLGF-2 | DATE: 12 Aug 1955 | COMMENT NO. 1: 1st Ind/art, 271(6/B22/23A

1. Reference is made to AF Form 112, Subject, "UFOB," dated 17 May 1955 and originated by the Intelligence Officer, 11th Fighter Interceptor Squadron.

2. Weapons Guidance Laboratory comments on referenced report are as follows:

a. Based on the vectoring and range data contained in the report, a plot (Figure 1) of the intercept shows that the target could have been an aircraft of similar performance to modern jet aircraft. During the intercept the target was executing a tight turn to starboard.

b. For a portion of the targets turn to starboard, the interceptor and target were flying approximately parallel (Figure 1,D) at about the same velocity. With the target at 35 degrees starboard and flying parallel to the interceptor, the target would appear as a stationary return on the RO's scope.

c. It is doubtful that the pilots indicator or the RO's scope could be used to accurately measure the 1000 knots reported speed of the target as it was going out in range. The maximum opening range rate that can be observed from the range rate gap on the pilots indicator is 200 knots. The fire control system specification requires that the system should be able to measure range rate from 1200 knots closing to 200 knots opening range rate.

d. Another possible explanation of the reported speed of the target as it went out in range is that the interceptors radar jumped lock. For a short period of time and with a slight misalignment of the system, the radar could appear to be locked onto the target while actually the radar had jumped lock. Under these conditions, the return on the scope could move in such a manner that the RO would believe that the return was a target.

e. The reported elevation angles of the target as it was going out in range at 1000 knots are considered to be approximate, as only the approximate elevation angles of the antenna are indicated by the position of the elevation marker at the right edge of the RO's scope. Also, because the indicated elevation angle is measured with respect to the interceptor heading and not with respect to ground coordinates, a diving or climbing attitude of the interceptor would result in a corresponding increase or decrease of the elevation angle.

1. The enclosed preliminary UFOB report is transmitted for
your information. The nature of this sighting is such that your
organization is probably better equipped to handle it.

2. This organization checked with the 3rd Weather Group, ADC,
resulting in no indication of weather phenomena at the time and
location of sighting which might help to explain this report.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance to final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Depth lost of report on AF Form 112-Part II)

In accordance with AFR 200-2, this report describes in detail the sighting of an unidentified flying object by an aircrew of this unit. The aircrew (pilot and radar observer) made the observation by radar while on a routine night training mission. The inexplicable speed and maneuvers part of the object were studied, significant enough to be made this report.

APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PAGE    2    OF    3    PAGES

(1.) Description:
    (a)    Not discernable (radar sighting)
    (b)    "        "
    (c)    One
    (d)    "
    (e)    None discernable
    (f)    "        "

(2) Description of course:
    (a)    Unusual characteristics of return on scope.
    (b)    Level and 45 degrees starboard.
    (c)    30 degrees above and 60 degrees starboard.
    (d)    (Statement of observer) Object came at 15 miles, 45 degrees starboard level, with 200 knots (indicated airspeed). Believing it was target aircraft, we turned 45 degrees starboard and looked object on 10's scope. Target moved over to 20 degrees starboard at end of turn. At 8 miles we turned port again about 30 degrees and were now over 25 degrees starboard. Still reading level, object then came down the scope at about 36 degrees (no more than 38 degrees) and no less than 33 degrees). Target was down from 8 miles to 6 miles at 25 degrees starboard when pilot was flying the dot. Target reading again at 25 degrees starboard and time-to-go circle decreased from 20 seconds to go to 8 or 10 seconds. On our scope target was bright and sharp. Starboard to 6,000 yards and stopped dead. It immediately began going out in range faster than it was in (straying). Pilot's elevation dot then moved from level to 20 degrees above. Pilot's time-to-go circle went from about 8 or ten seconds to about 20 seconds. From this point view the target started going out in range, as (his interceptor) were in straight and level flight with about 375 knots at 26,000 feet. We took a hard port turn when this indication was about 10 miles (35 degrees above). Estimated speed at the target indication was about 375 knots at 26,000 feet. According to scope interpretation and pilot's and GCI's performance in running interception, would be over 1,200 knots.

(3) Manner of observation:
    (a)    Air-electronic: MG-40; MG-84
    (b)    None
    (c)    F-89D, 32:25, 26,000 feet, 045 degrees original heading, 090 degrees last heading, 375 knots, minute.

(4) (a)    14/0233
    (b)    Night

(5)    Latitude: 47 degrees 71 North
        Longitude: 93 degrees 071 West
