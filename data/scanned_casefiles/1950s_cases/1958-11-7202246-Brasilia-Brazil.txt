FLYING SAUCER REPORT--A strange, unidentified object thought to be a flying saucer attracted the attention of some 500 persons in Brasilia, the future capital of Brazil, at about 4 p.m. on Nov. 9. A Brazilian Air Force plane went up about 3,000 meters to investigate, but came back to its base without results. The FAB plane commander said that the object was flying at an altitude of about 12,000 meters.
