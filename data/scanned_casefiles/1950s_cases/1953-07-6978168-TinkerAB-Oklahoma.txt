Reference your PICUREP 0450-2R-7-10-3 reporting one round, white, shiny object sighted 082227Z, ATRC requests wire answer to the following questions: 1) What were the estimated azimuth and elevation readings of the unidentified object sighted by Lt. Jarrett) and the azimuth and elevation readings of the balloon sighted by civilian and military observers through binoculars at 235021 ATRC attempting to establish that both sightings were of the same object - the balloon. 2) Did the 136 AB report any radar contact in the area at the time of sighting?

ATRC has received three sightings of unidentified objects from you recently. Suggest you contact Lt. Knorr, Intelligence Officer, 136 AB. He would be able to brief civilian personnel, weather personnel, and civilian guards on unidentified flying objects. ATRC believes 8 July sighting was of a balloon, possibility of the two preceding sightings also being weather balloons.

Balloon By 6th Wing - 2100 ft
Sighting At - 2587 ft
Balloon Raised By Towline - 2150 ft

If the fighting win of 67th random which balloon has hill, would have been cut 87.00 ft. it seems improbable that same a excellent up gift. Realtor would could be seen out this height.

The balloon manned by Towline - if placed at 2100 ft would be at 87 ft. 187.00 ft. the height to be in the 2100 ft ascending.

Note:
USAF Winds Bureau plotted a profile of 2100 ft according to 2.18 minutes.
