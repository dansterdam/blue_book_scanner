According to that excellent commentator, you have been withholding some "answer" facts from the public. I place with you to withhold nothing. You must admit that the Air Force's contradictions in the past, its acknowledgments and its denials, have done it no credit, and have made the thinking public completely suspicious of it.

Pennsylvania
May 2nd, 1954

Gentlemen :-

I have just finished reading Ruppelt's excellent summation in TRUE magazine. I completely agree with all his statements except that the Air Force has no knowledge of the "landing" of a U.F.O..

I think it most odd that the Air Force spent thousands on track-ing down patently fictitious accounts of "little men", and sublimely ignored the factual accounts of landings of U.F.O.s, such as the six foot, mmy-flowing sphere which gently alighted onto a Philadelphia field, September 30, 1950 (which, when touched by one of the policeman who saw it fall, dematerialized into a sticky film). It appears to me that such accounts smack too much of the supernatural (preternatural) and are hence conveniently excluded from A.T.I.C. files.

I note, with some interest, that you maintain a file initialed "C. P." into which you dump any and all letters written you by those interested in the "flying" saucers? I have received some very "odd" letters in reply to my "saucer" pieces in the Saturday Evening Post and Life magazines, and I can well sympathize with you on this point, but I certainly trust you have the good sense to discriminate, "and not throw out the wheat with the chaff, simply because it is in letter form.

Relative to the West Palm Beach fiasco and the Adamski bid for publicity, should you read a 1953 copy of (excuse the stupid title) FATE magazine, you will see where I strongly questioned the authenticity of both the scoutmaster's and "Professor" Adamski's "encounters". I can smell a fraud ten miles off. To think that the Air Force spent a fair sum to investigate the West Palm Beach tale. Seems incredible. The West Virginia "monster" appeared to be well worth looking into, but appears to have been shrugged off by Intelligence with a cute remark.

Incidentally, Adamski is booked in London halls for his lecture tour this summer. I understand that a fellow SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN - is touring the United States describing his trip in a "saucer". His name: Orfeo Angelucci - a little fellow I'll swear is trying to compensate for a feeling of gloomy inadequacy and boredom in the plastics division of Lockheed Aircraft.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
