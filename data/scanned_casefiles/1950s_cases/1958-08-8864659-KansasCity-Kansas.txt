We just saw notice of the terrible winds carrying over. My husband studied looking back than anticipated became drive partly at time. When he spotted this he mistook it for the rocket carrier & called me outside.

When I got out doors this light was slid to my right up in the sky at some brighter than usually is coming with the sky. It was moving in I slight arc across the sky. It would be visible for job perhaps 10 seconds & then disappeared & then flicke on again further along the arc. I & saw it flicker about 4 times & then it was no longer visible. Later the neighbors called his out & showed us trouble.

8:HC                                                      21 AUGUST

17 September 1958

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your letter of 23 August 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object was referred to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for analysis and/or evaluation.

As you know, a thorough check of the circumstances surrounding this sighting was made by qualified investigators.

The evaluation revealed that several Air Force planes were in the area that night and one aircraft was in the exact position and heading reported by you. These planes had completed training mission and were preparing to descend and land. Also it is common practice prior to landing to check wing lights and flash lights to warn other aircraft are in the area.

Incidentally the is the solution to your sighting on that particular night.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

"rather carrier which acted specially
then was any top paper steading it
the neighbors had been watching it
very night this week."

The text appears to be handwritten and somewhat difficult to read with complete certainty. The page is labeled "Page 10" in the top right corner.

The image appears to be a technical diagram or chart showing a hemispherical projection with various angular measurements. The diagram includes:

- Degree markings from 0° to 90°
- Curved grid lines
- A shaded/textured area on the left side of the projection
- Various numerical and alphabetical notations along the edges

The specific text and numbers are partially illegible due to the image quality, but some visible markings include:
- 0°
- 20°
- 30°
- 50°
- 90°

The diagram seems to be some kind of scientific or navigational projection, possibly related to astronomical, geographical, or meteorological measurements.

Kansas City 6, Kansas
August 23, 1958

Department of the Air Force
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sirs:

I've heard that the Air Force collects and studies reports of unidentified flying objects. Here is a brief description of something I observed recently.

I hope you will forward it to the proper office, and that I may be of some use.

At 8:40 p.m., August 21, I was standing in my yard in Kansas City watching for the rocket carrier of the Sputnik III which had been observed over Kansas City on several previous nights that week. I had not seen the Sputnik before so didn't know exactly what to expect.

I noticed a flash of light near the horizon almost directly north, possibly slightly east of north, which I first thought to be a meteor. However, I had the impression (I saw the flash from the corner of my eye) that the light had moved up from the horizon rather than down toward it. A few seconds later another flash occurred, moving upward at about 45 degrees from the horizon. After another interval a flash occurred at 90 degrees from the north horizon, but not directly overhead. It was perhaps 75 degrees above the west horizon. Three more flashes occurred at constant intervals of a few seconds, each one further north and slightly west. After the first three flashes, the distance between flashes appeared less although the time of the intervals seemed the same.

To last flashes were close to the moon which was very bright, and I continued to observe the flashes even though they were as bright as a bright star and were moving.

The total impression was that something had flown overhead within less than a minute, giving off light at about a regular intervals. It seemed the entire sky with six flashes observed. Since the flashes of light were not as far apart as I at first sought, I am following the curvature of the earth as closely as it had when appearing from the North. It was a quiet night and I heard no sound.

I was certain that I had seen the Sputnik rocket carrier until 20 minutes later, at 9:00 p.m., the neighbors called for me to come out and see the Sputnik. The neighbors had observed the Sputnik on previous nights and assured me that what I had seen earlier was not the Sputnik. The Sputnik on this night was similar to a faint star in intensity, and it appeared in the vicinity of the Big Dipper constellation with was about 25 degrees west of where the other light had appeared. The Sputnik rocket carrier flashed many times and was visible for about 10 minutes.

I have enclosed a diagram of how the first object appeared to me. I hope this information may be of some use to you.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

observations, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observa-
tion in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached
if they are needed.

DATE 30 Aug 53

All that was seen was a series of flashes of light similar to that produced by a meteor or falling star. However the flashes occurred at regular intervals of a few seconds, and a straight line could be drawn through the paths of each six flashes. It was therefore convincing that one object had passed quickly from North to Southwest horizon, giving off flashes of light at regular intervals. Nothing was seen between the flashes. It appeared near the North horizon and traveled to the Southwest horizon within less than a minute.

The flashes occurred at regular intervals of time, but after it crossed overhead the space distance between flashes was progressively less. Six flashes were observed altogether.

II. RELIABILITY: Source was sincere and eager to help. He gave positive information as to sequence of events, however, was not too sure of his convictions.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source stated that he had read that a rocket carrier of Sputnik III was to pass over the Kansas City area on the 21st of August 1958 at approximately 2100 hours CST. That evening he started watching the sky early so he wouldn't miss it. At 2040 hours CST he noticed an object appear on the north horizon at a fifteen (15) degree elevation. It looked like a bright star flashing on and off as it moved across the sky. There was a three (3) to five (5) second interval between flashes. Length of flashes could not be estimated. It followed a path due north to slightly west of him (seventy five (75) degree elevation) when overhead and disappeared in the southwest thirty (30) degrees above the horizon.

The approximate degrees elapsed from horizon for each of the six (6) flashes were: twenty (20) degrees, sixty (60) degrees, seventy five (75) degrees, sixty five (65) degrees, fifty (50) degrees, thirty (30) degrees.

The object crossed the sky in less than one (1) minute. Source could not estimate speed or altitude.

After further questioning Source stated that the flashes of light were possibly elongated. At arms length the flash of light was visible traveling through the sky approximately seven (7) inches before it faded out.

The sky was clear with a bright moon shining. The night was warm with many stars. A slight breeze was blowing.

   EDUCATION: Attended University of Iowa
   QUALIFICATIONS: None

II. RELIABILITY: Source was helpful and cooperative, however in her own words her sense of discretion and timing are very poor.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 21 August 1958 at 2040 hours CST, source was called from her home by husband who had seen an unknown object in the sky while watching for the rocket carrier of Sputnik III. Source observed the object for 15 seconds.

Source could not estimate the speed, size, altitude or material of the object. She did further that it was as bright as an auto headlight a mile or more away and flickered off and on, and was slightly brighter than a star. The light was on for ten (10) seconds at a time and was observed four times. The object appeared from the northeast and disappeared into the southwest, where it was lost in moon light. It moved in a slight arc.

It was a clear night with a bright moon and many stars were visible. The night was cool and dry.

A short time later the source was called outside by a neighbor who showed her the rocket carrier passing overhead.

2. Mr. [redacted], president of the Moonwatchers team of the Astronomy Club, Kansas City, Missouri, stated that on 21 August 1958 the rocket carrier of Sputnik III officially passed over Kansas City, Missouri between the hours of 2047 and 2057 CST following a course generally from the Northwest to the Southeast. The satellite, Sputnik III, was heard over Kansas City, Mo at 2007'30" hours that evening but it has never been seen over Kansas City.

3. The Chief Controller, [redacted], Air Route Traffic Control, Kansas City, Missouri stated that there were ten (10) aircraft in the Kansas-Missouri area over 30,000 feet on 21 August 1958 between 2030 and 2045 hours. Aircraft, B-47s, were flying local and exact locations could not be determined.

4. Base Operations, Schilling AFB, Salina, Kansas (GEORGE FJHJ 2450) stated that on the day and time in question, they had one B-47 over Kansas City B-47s at an altitude of 30,000 feet.

"Comments of the Preparing Officer:

1. This sighting was probably caused by one of the aircraft flying in the area during the time of the sighting, for the following reasons:

a. A B-47 aircraft, Nursemaid 34, was flying the approximate course of the sighting. Since other aircraft in the area were flying local, they could have flown the course of the sighting.

b. It is a common practice for SAC aircraft to check wing lights for icing or flash their lights whenever other aircraft are in the area. This would account for the elongated flash of light observed by the Source.

c. Judgement of time by Mr [redacted] that the object was observed thirty (30) to Forty-five (45) seconds. During this time he observed the first flash from the corner of his eye, faced in the direction of the flash and looked for the second flash, and up on rotating it, called to his wife, who in turn came out of the house, was shown the path of the flashes, and she saw approximately four (4) of these flashes.

d. The unidentified object was not the Sputnik carrier, because Mr [redacted] and Mrs [redacted] were shown their neighbors approximately fifteen (15) minutes later. The neighbors stated to the interviewer that they had seen the Sputnik carrier before and were able to recognize it immediately. The time of their sighting of the Sputnik carrier also corresponds with the official time.
