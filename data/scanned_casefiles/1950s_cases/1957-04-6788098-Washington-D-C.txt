REPORT NO. 1-57
PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

c. Ceiling - Measured 6500 broken.
d. Visibility - 15 miles.
e. Amount of cloud cover - 4/10 to 9/10.
f. Thunderstorms in area - none.

8. None.
9. Negative.
10. Negative.
11. Position title and comments of the preparing officer:
    a. Director, Plans and Programming.

    b. The description of this incident indicates that an intercept by jet aircraft occurred. If the objects' speed were that estimated by the observer, it would have been approximately 9000 mph and in world to difficult to follow such movements even for the time period estimated. The thunderlike boom heard indicates that some barrier was penetrated and was more likely caused by jet interceptors. Mr. [redacted] apparently is not seeking any personal notoriety. The reliability of this report is unknown.

12. Negative.
