11. COMMENTS
Two of the witnesses stated the obj was similar to a weather balloon. The direction of obj from observers was N and NW. The US Weather Bureau at Sulfer Grove, N of Dayton, released a balloon at 1830 hrs. Balloon stayed above the station after release. This balloon is probably cause for this sighting.
