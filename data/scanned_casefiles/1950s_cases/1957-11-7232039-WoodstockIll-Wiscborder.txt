GALESBURG, ILL., NOV. 5--(UP)--A "FIERY ORANGE" OBJECT HOVERED OVER THE GALESBURG AREA IN THE PRE-DAWN HOURS TODAY AND THEN DISAPPEARED IN A NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION, A FARMER'S WIFE REPORTED TODAY.

MRS. WILLIAM STEAGALL SAID SHE SPOTTED THE CIGAR OR EGG-SHAPED OBJECT IN THE SKY ABOUT 4:30 A.M. WHEN SHE WAS AWAKEN BY THE BARKING OF A NEIGHBOR'S DOG.

ADD OBJECT: GALESBURG HX NEIGHBOR'S DOG.

WIS., EAST NIGHT WEEKLY NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED BILL STEWART SAW HE AND SCOTT, OTHER PERSONS, INCLUDING AN EPISCOPAL MINISTER, SAW "WHAT LOOKED LIKE A BRIGHT MOON OR EXTRA BRIGHT STAR," OVAL SHAPED, STREAKING ACROSS THE SKY.

MRS. STEAGALL, REPORTING ON THE GALESBURG "WHATNIK," SAID IT FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOON, BUT THEN I REALIZED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE AN ORANGE-COLORED MOON.

"THEN I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS SPUTNIK."

MRS. STEAGALL SAID SHE WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND THEN TRIED TO ROUSE HER HUSBAND FROM SLEEP. WHEN THEY HAD STOPPED BAYING, SHE SAID.

"IT SEEMED TO STAND STILL, AND THEN MOVED SLOWLY TOWARD THE NORTH," SHE SAID. "IT WAS ABOUT TWICE AS LARGE AS THE MOON."

THE STEAGALL FARM IS LOCATED ABOUT SIX MILES OUTSIDE OF GALESBURG.

A WOMAN IN GALESBURG ALSO SAID SHE SPOTTED AN OBJECT IN THE SKY AROUND 4 A.M. CST.

AT CHICAGO, MRS. ELROY SANDQUIST JR. SAID SHE SPOTTED A ROUND, BRIGHT, PINKISH-ORANGE COLORED OBJECT IN THE SKY EARLY SUNDAY.
