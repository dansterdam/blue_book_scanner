No. Case (Information Only)                                                   15 October 1957
                                                                    Bernardsville, New Jersey

October 15, 1957: At about 6:15 P.M. EST, half an hour after sunset, Mrs. Mildred E. Simms was driving home from Morristown, N.J. She was two miles from Bernardsville and had just turned from Route 202 into North Maple Avenue, which runs south to Basking Ridge. At that moment her attention was suddenly attracted by an extremely brilliant light apparently 100 ft. above the two fused headlights. Her first impression was that a airplane with landing lights on was coming right at her. She stopped and rolled down the window, no sound could be heard. Some Black Angus cattle were grazing in the field; the light was beyond them, but she could not estimate its distance. It was well above the ground, though she was only certain of this the next morning, when she inspected the site by daylight, and noted that there was no hill or town in that direction. Its direction was east-northeast, exactly opposite to Venus (with which, besides, Mrs. Simms is perfectly familiar; this light, she says, was incomparably larger and more conspicuous, though still smaller than the full moon.) It seemed to wobble, but this may have been illusion. After watching for five minutes, she started up and drove on somewhat. The light remained visible, apparently in the same place (now being left behind her.) Near Lyons, three miles to the south, she stopped and watched it again. From here it appeared in the north-northeast, smaller, but still large enough to see that it had apparently tilted; it presented a luminous crescent-like appearance, with a dark rounded portion (perhaps the lower surface) below the crescent. She drove over the hill and lost sight of it.

Mrs. Simms' intelligence, and the facts that she is familiar with astronomical data and took no previous interest in UFOs, influence us to take this report more seriously than if it had emanated from a witness not known to us. Information was obtained by Les Haber from Mrs. Simms' daughter (a co-worker of his) and subsequently from the observer.

Balloonists
Gather High
Flight Data

MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 16 (JP)—Two stratospheric explorers said today information they collected at a height of nearly 16 miles could clear the way for "extremely high altitude flights."

Navy balloonists Malcom D. Ross and Morton L. Lewis, Washington, D. C., detailed for newsmen a nine-hour flight that carried them from an open pit iron mine in Crosby, Mich., yesterday to Kermanning, Mich. Notable aspects of the flight, they said, was the ability of the sealed aluminum gondola in which they rode to withstand a high altitude such as this.

"We had a double-bubble and composite aboard in a 6-foot pressurized gondola at this high altitude, and that even at this altitude the gondola did not tend to disturb the platform."

They were able to make "valuable" and could fly higher altitude flights from Rapid City, S. D., while aboard their balloon, making fast time and with good weather. The balloonists devoted nearly full time to making observations and measurements of a project gathered in the past few weeks.

                                "THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT"

The reader will have noticed that the November 1957 sighting waves in the U.S., 
like the Fall 1951 wave in France, has been marked by numerous reports of landings, 
with and without occupants. The skeptic who disbelieves all these stories must 
conclude that the US population possesses an unsuspected streak of imagination; 
since, along with similarities, the stories show differences of unexpected details 
that call for considerable powers of invention. Tales, for example, the story told 
by Mr. and Mrs. Beverly Potter, of South Lee, Mass., who were interviewed at their 
home by the Reverend Albert Baller of Greenfield after WBRK (Pittsfield) broadcast, 
on Nov. 6, Mrs. Potter's account of the experience, which had taken place about two 
weeks before. The following comes chiefly from Mr. Baller's letter about his talk 
with the Potters.

Between 2 and 3 a.m. the Potters were awakened by a noise like a jet about to 
land - "but not really like a jet, either." Looking out of their bedroom window, 
they saw the back yard illuminated by light that came around the corner of the house. 
From a source that was then inviolable. The lighted area "went bright and dim," 
and dim, and they could see three dark figures moving around, that "kept bumping 
into things and making a lot of racket." The "jet" noise had been replaced by a 
high-pitched whining sound; "It made my head ache all the time," Mrs. Potter said. 
"After a while" Mr. Potter shouted at the "things" to go away, and they ran behind 
a shed. About then, the source of the light moved around the corner of the house. 
It was "a kind of floating things, about two feet from the ground and about six feet 
from the ground at the top." It was "sort of without any sharp or clear shape," but 
gave out light in front of it and under it; in was dark behind it." The figures 
"moved away," and in the object moved off "up the hill," when into the sky. In the 
morning the Potters found the high grass in the next field matted down, objects near 
the shed licked over, and a shovel broken. Mr. Baller was impressed by the way the 
observers told their story, and by its agreement in all essentials with the tape of 
the radio interview. A copy of this tape is being made for CSI.

Reports of physical distress seemingly caused by the proximity of a UFO, like 
Mrs. Potter's headache that went away when the "object" left, are not absolutely 
unique, but the blundering about, an if in the dark, may be. The first report of its 
kind. (Note: Our remarks in the first paragraph are not to be taken as indicating 
that CSI accepts this report, or any other in this issue, at present. However, we 
give great weight to the opinion of our respected colleagues, the Reverend Baller.)

URGENT

TOLO OBJECT -1957

HONOLULU, NOV. (UP) - THE FIJI GOVERNMENT, IN A REPORT RECEIVED HERE TODAY, SAID A WHITE CLERGYMAN AND FOUR NATIVES REPORTED SIGHTING A DAZZLING OBJECT IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC SKIES WHICH GENERALLY MATCHED THE DESCRIPTION OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT REPORTED IN TEXAS.

THE REPORT ISSUED FROM SUVA, CAPITAL OF THE FIJI ISLAND GROUP, SAID THREE SEPARATE SIGHTINGS OF THE STRANGE FLYING OBJECT WERE REPORTED LAST WEEK.

THE REPORT SAID, FOUR FIJIAN FISHERMEN FROM THE NABOUQALI VILLAGE IN BUA PROVINCE ON THE ISLAND OF VANUA LEVU SAID THEY SAW A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY COLORED AND CIRCULAR IN SHAPE DESCENDING FROM THE SKY. THEY WERE VERY NEAR IT AND SAW IT HOVERING AT A STEADY HEIGHT OF 20 FEET ABOVE THE SEA.

"IT APPEARED TO BE REVOLVING AND ON IT APPEARED TO BE THE FIGURE OF A MAN," THE SUVA REPORT CONTINUED. "AS THE FIJIANS APPROACHED THEIR BOAT, A BLINDING LIGHT SHONE ON THEM. THEY SAID IT DAZZLED AND MADE THEIR FEEL WEAK."

"THEN THE OBJECT WENT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY," THE REPORT SAID.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR SEPTEMBER 28, 1957

See Fall Constellations
Some characteristic fall constellations are visible in
the southern sky during October, which also brings an un-
usual solar eclipse visible only from Antarctica.

By JAMES STOKLEY

► ALTHOUGH the autumn skies do not
have the brilliance of those of summer, there
are some interesting and characteristic con-
stellations which now shine in the south.

These appear on the accompanying maps,
which depict the skies as they appear about
ten o'clock, your own kind of standard
time—and one hour for the night saving
time shift. The first of October, the map
at the middle of the month and eight
o'clock at the end.

High in the southern sky are the four
stars marking the great square of Pegasus,
the winged horse. These are the stars of
these are in Pegasus: Alpheratz, the one
in the upper left-hand corner, is in the
neighboring group of Andromeda, the
chained lady. Diagonally opposite is
Markab, which is in the horse's neck, as the
figure was drawn on the old star maps.

The row of stars extending downward
and to the right from Markab form the
head. The stars extending westward from
the upper right-hand corner are his fore-
feet. For the animal is shown upside-down
as it appears in the sky. On the lower left
side of the square, you will come to a
bright star, low in the south, which is called
Fomalhaut, and is part of Piscis Australis.

The southern sky. This is always a high
if ever was, in our northern latitudes.

That is why it is represented by the
chart as seen from the southern hemisphere,
though it is of the first magnitude, according to the warm weather hereby the sum-
mer reckons star brightness. Because it
is so low, its light has to pass through a
great deal more atmosphere than a star
than if it were higher up in the sky.

The symbols on the star maps show
as they appear and they are only shown
with their full brightness when they are
fairly high.

Constellations of the Zodiac

Now moving over to the east we find,
near the horizon at the map-times, brilliant
Capella, in Auriga, the charioteer. To the
right is part of Taurus, the bull, with a
reddish star called Aldebaran. Both of
these belong to the winter star groups
which will be so prominent in the south
during winter evenings.

On the celestial program for October
there is an eclipse of the sun, best known by
only people to see it will be the observers
of the genuine partial solar eclipse in the
current international Geophysical Year.

An eclipse of the sun occurs when the
moon passes between sun and earth, so
that the lunar shadow falls on part of the
earth. This shadow is very narrow, almost
or more shadow, where the moon com-
pletely hides the sun, and the outer penum-
bra, from which the lunar disc would only
partially cover the sun's face. Where the
umbra reaches, an eclipse is total; from the
penumbra only a partial eclipse may be
seen.

During the night of Oct. 22 by U. S.
time, most of Antarctica, the southern tip
of Africa, and the southwestern parts of
Madagascar and New Zealand, as well as
the Indian Ocean, will be more or less
covered by the penumbra, so that a partial
eclipse of the sun will be observed from
these regions.

[The rest of the text includes two star charts with constellation diagrams and a note at the bottom: "SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS"]


- page 9 -

Here is the text from the document:

The umbra, however, will just graze the earth's atmosphere, barely touching it along the Antarctic coast, near Halley Bay, where a British expedition is located. Scientists there will be able to take advantage of this opportunity for some unique observations, if the weather is clear; if it is not, the eclipse should will be useful.

This is an important phase of the IGY program is concerned with the ionosphere, the layer of the atmosphere that reflects radio waves back to the ground, and is affected by the sun's radiation. When the eclipse occurs, this important observations are expected.

Without traveling to Antarctica, anyone will be able to see evening skies in October but several times. This occurrence once called Algol, in the constellation of Perseus, the champion, which is seen in the north, near above Auriga.

Algol known as a beta Persei, is the second brightest star in the constellation Persei, the brightest is Mirfak, a little to the left. Ordinarily, Algol is of magnitude 2.8, while Mirfak is 1.80, or about 25% brighter.

Below Algol (under the letter P in Persei) is the star called epsilon Persei, of magnitude 2.88, and Algol is about twice as bright.

However, if you look at these stars at about 9:07 p.m. on the evening of Oct. 13, you will find that their order of brightness has changed, and epsilon will be about 20% brighter than Algol, which is now only a third as bright as it is normally. On the evening of Oct. 19, Algol will shine with its normal brightness, but on the 21st, Algol may rise or fall in brightness, it will again have faded.

Actually, Algol is not a single star, but two stars revolving around the center of gravity of the pair. These are known as an eclipsing binary star, and the evolution of Oct. 13 and one star is much brighter than the other.

In about 10 hours 9 minutes, the dark component of Algol passes partially in front of the bright component, dims it as an eclipse, which dims its light. This takes about 10 hours for the eclipse of the dark star.

The rest of the document contains a "Celestial Time Table for October" with various astronomical event times and details.

At the bottom, there is a note: "Subtract one hour for CST, two hours for MST, and three for PST" and "Science News Letter, September 28, 1957"

24 October 1957 Portales, New Mexico

from the sky. Silky threads, some of them 50 feet long, draped across telephone and power lines. They created a nuisance in some arms and often fields, where harvest is underway.

A possible explanation for the mysterious substances came from an engineer at Sandia Weapons Base in Albuquerque. He said it was caused by millions of minute particles of dust high in the atmosphere. He said the dust particles, rubbing together, cause a static charge. This, in turn, caused the dust to fall to earth in the cobweb form. The engineer said he had heard of similar occurrences in Bakersfield and Fresno, California.

Other falls, of course, have been reported in various areas in the world, and have come to be known as Angel's Hair, often connected with flights of unknown aerial objects over the same areas, either before, during, or after the fall. Some of the cobweb-like material, some of which then behaves in most unusual manner.

Perhaps another theory or enigma is forming. Some time ago it was cracked windshields and disappearing garden hose, borrowing into the ground. Now, for the 1957 fall season it was caused of ice of large and somewhat improbable proportions coming from the sky (1), and some (2) covering entire sunset.

GOSSAMER FALL HERALDS SAUCER WAVE

In view of the good evidence in the preceding item that "gossamer" may properly be identified with angel hair - or, at least, may not properly be identified with spider web - it may be significant that a typical gossamer fall occurred at Portales, New Mexico, on October 23-24, 1957. Levelland, Texas, the scene of UFO landings ten days later, is only 66 miles southwest of Portales. If it is a coincidence (Aimé Michel writes that the great European landing wave of late 1954 was likewise ushered in by angel-hair falls.) -Our source for the details is the Portales News-Tribune, October 24, 25, 27:

The cobwebby strands, "apparently falling from a great height" and up to 50 feet long, began to fall near Portales in the late afternoon of the 23rd, and by the next morning were drifting down on Portales itself. Characteristically, they fell in enormous quantities, "a lot heavier south of here than in Portales ... all the way to Hobbs" (110 miles south of Portales). Most likely it was falling also at Levelland, which is closer to Portales than Hobbs is. It was found not to be radioactive. Apparently, not a soul ever heard of gossamer. Falling, and an extraordinary ridiculous theory was propounded by an anonymous "engineer at the Sandia Base at Albuquerque," who declared that the threads were composed of "atmospheric dust" matted together in strands by a static electricity charge. This "explanation" was syndicated by AP all over the country. Eventually, however, someone was found who knew that gossamer is supposed to be spider web. Dr. William Kister, University of New Mexico biologist, offered the spider-web explanation tentatively, without examining the material. The News-Tribune editors went to the library, found that the books said the same thing, and happily published a story (Oct. 27), with the flat headline, "Gossamer Showers Due to Spiders." The only corroboration: "Airmen at Cannon Air Force Base reported they found tiny spiders attached to the silken threads." (No one in Portales had noticed anything of the sort, and we doubt very much that this "report" is accurate.) The AP syndicated this explanation across the country, and ten days later, in precisely the same area, the November saucer-landing wave erupted.

Several Report Seeing Red Satellite, Rocket

By KARL ABRAHAM

The Soviet satellite last the third-stage rocket which broke away from the main body of the Sputnik II satellite was sighted last night, generally some cloud cover at 5:00 feet, 7:15, 7:20 and 7:25 p.m.

Reports of the sightings from 6:48 to 6:50 p.m. came both from radio and young men who claimed to have seen the flying objects with their naked eyes. The length of sightings ranged from three to 10 seconds. The object moved northwest from Dayton.

The satellite came closest to Dayton at exactly 6:46.40 p.m., according to Lloyd Reed, director of research for the Battelle Glass Co.

Listening to sensitive radio equipment at his home at 418 miles east, he fixed the distance from Dayton at 418 miles.

Reed determined the distance of the satellite by measuring the change in the frequency of its radio transmission as they approach and depart.

On the basis of these calculations he predicted the following time periods for the satellite (local time): 6:46, 6:48 and 6:50 p.m. Root said the best time to sight the satellite, weather permitting, would be at 6:50 p.m. The rocket, however, will be less visible. Wed. 23, 77
