f. Last observed: 215 degrees, elevation 20 degrees.

g. Object in sight for only 2 to 3 seconds. Was in a straight descending flight path.

h. Time and date: 15562, 22 June 1958, i.e. 1556½ hrs EST, Daylight.

i. Weather data: Determined ceiling and visibility at Knoxville Municipal Airport 2000 scattered, 2500, overcast, 9 miles visibility. Winds, general West-North West from 6000 to 50,000 ft. According to report, Gen. Brandt states he was looking at thunderstorms when UFO observed. Apparently thunderstorm in area of UFO observation.

4. Cursory plot (Aero Chart, WAC, No. 358) and analysis indicates sun approximately at 45 degrees elevation and to the East; object descending to SW, and over large body of water, all conducive to the refraction of light, and specular reflection of sunlight off some aircraft's fuselage in the distance. (Aero. Rpt. Ref. Area-Well-Known type of reflection bathes an aircraft in a brilliant halo of light generally washing out its wing and tail surfaces - giving it a thin, slender, cylindrical appearance. Gen. Brandt's description of a pencil-like appearance and brilliant, white color tentatively supports this.

5. Checks here with appropriate agency do not indicate any balloons; no reports of any UFOs or anything unusual from radar, AACS, GUC or other units and persons in that area and time. Your checks will probably require military and civil aircraft flight checks for the area. (Par 58, AFR 200-2) Remote possibility of daytime "bolide" being checked out here, but improbable.

6. Significant to point out that instead of an electrical report being made of incident for expeditious action, incident was reported by routine 112, without copies to interested agencies, and sole report to ATIC. UFO not reported until 12 July 58, all in general non-conformity with AFR 200-2 for immediate reporting and transmission of UFO sightings. Therefore, report just received this Center.

1) Size of obj. approx. length = 2ft. approx. width = 1½ inches (.125 in.) approx. (GV)

2) Distance Plotted = 50 statute miles (6,160,000 inches)

3) S/.125 x 1/D = 396,000 / 3,168,000 = 16,500 inches (Est. size GV)
