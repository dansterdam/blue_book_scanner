PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT #14 

Covering the Period 1 January 1953 through 31 August 1953

This report is the fourteenth in the series of periodic reports on the United States Air Force Project Blue Book investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The purpose of this report is to present all of the factual data, analyses, and conclusions of the investigations of unidentified flying objects conducted by Project Blue Book during the period from 1 January 1953 through 31 August 1953.

The report includes a detailed analysis of sightings, a discussion of the statistical aspects of the data, and an evaluation of the significance of the data. Also included in this report are recommendations based on the results of the investigations.

REPORT SUBJECT: Greenville, North Carolina
DATE: 6 February 1954
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: Greenville, North Carolina
TIME OF INCIDENT: 1600 hours

DETAILS OF INCIDENT:
On 6 February 1954 at approximately 1600 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed over Greenville, North Carolina. The object was described as circular in shape, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, and was observed for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing from view.
Several witnesses reported the object was metallic in appearance and was traveling at a high rate of speed. No sound was reported by the witnesses. No evidence or physical traces were found at the scene.
The incident was reported to the US Air Force, which launched an investigation under Project Blue Book. A radar tracking record was obtained, which showed an unidentified target in the area at the time of the sighting. The radar track is provided as supporting evidence.

Preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting:
The primary cause of the sighting was through the normal duties as a radar operator in the ACORN sr. All operators were alerted to look out for any unusual phenomena when unusual phenomena was noted.
Comments: Sightings were reported on 15 February 1954, but investigation of such sightings at 1550 on 23 February 1954. Procedures of investigation was limited due to the length of time between sightings and notification to this department of same.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
SIGHTINGS REPORT
Greenville, North Carolina
February 6, 1954
This report concerns the sighting of an unidentified flying object near Greenville, North Carolina on February 6, 1954. The report states that a local resident observed a bright, glowing object in the sky that maneuvered rapidly before disappearing. The witness reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force. An investigation was subsequently conducted as part of Project Blue Book, the official U.S. government program for investigating UFO sightings.
