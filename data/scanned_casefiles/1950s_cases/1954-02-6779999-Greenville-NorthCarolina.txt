[Rest of this section is partially illegible]

On the right side of the document are two circular diagrams labeled "NORTH POLAR AREA" which appear to be polar projection maps or charts.

At the bottom of the document, there are some partially visible lines that seem to be administrative information, but most text is too blurry to read with certainty.

The rest of the text is largely illegible due to the poor quality and distorted nature of the black and white scanned document. The image appears to be a map or chart with a grid-like structure, but the details are difficult to make out clearly.

The right side of the document has a list of additional categories, but most text is too illegible to read clearly. The document appears to be some kind of aeronautical or military chart with detailed information in a tabular format.

The bottom half of the page is blank white space.

The text I can clearly read is:

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

On the right side of the document, there appears to be a partially legible list of labels, but most are too blurry to confidently transcribe. The document contains several technical diagrams including circular and cross-shaped graphics, but the text within those diagrams is not clearly legible.

The document appears to be a technical schematic or control diagram, likely related to air traffic control systems, but the details are difficult to make out due to the image quality.

The text I can read is partially illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. In the top left corner, there appears to be a form or table with some columns, but most of the text is too blurry to make out clearly. The words "CULTURAL AND" are partially visible, but the rest of the text is not readable. The document seems to be a black and white scanned page with a form on the left side and a mostly blank or dark area on the right side.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document.

In approximately KR 384 (GEORGE) at 160020Z Feb 54, Mrs. _______ saw a solid ball with two parallel white, brilliant green in color, darting across the sky. Length of observation was approximately ten seconds.

Due to coincidence of sighting report by an AGAW unit in this area, at approximately the same time, this report could possibly be true.

b. Target was flying in a prohibited area, and Pope AFB called the 728th AOCW Sq. in relation to the same track.

11. There were negative aircraft in the area except the following:
At 2215B, the observer picked up a "blip" flying airway from Columbia Airport
St. G, to Augusta, Georgia. "Blip" traveled approximately 250-230 knots, at an
elevation of 7,000 feet. The track of this "blip" and the track of the unidentified object merged at 2225-2226B.

12. Preparing Officer: Captain Joseph C. Sneeler
Position title: 63d T. C. Gp. Intelligence Officer.

Preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting:
The primary cause of the sighting was through the normal duties as a radar operator in the AOCW Sq. All sightings were kept on log and this report was logged as routine but was called in unperformance of came.

Comments: Sightings was reported on 15 February 1954 but notification of such was forwarded to our department at 1630 on 23 February 1954. Thoroughness of investigation was limited due to the length of time between sightings and notification to our department of same.

The image appears to be a complex map or chart with numerous intersecting lines, circles, and annotations. At the top left corner, I can partially make out "GREAT SMOKY MTS" (Great Smoky Mountains). The image is a black and white document with a dense network of lines, roads, or flight paths crisscrossing the page. Due to the low contrast and image quality, many of the specific text annotations are difficult to read clearly. The word "NORTH" is visible at the top right of the document.

12. Preparing officers: Captain Joseph C. Shultz
Position title: 634 T.C. Op. Intelligence Officer

Preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting:
Above named person was visiting friends and at the time of the sighting was just leaving for home. Due to the darkness of the night and the full moon, the observer was looking at the sky when sighting was made. The length of time of observation precluded her getting her friends to see the object in time.

Comments: Sightings were reported on 15 February 1954 at notification of our headquarters to our department at 1500 on 23 February 1954. Thoroughness of investigation was limited due to the length of time between sighting and notification to our department.
