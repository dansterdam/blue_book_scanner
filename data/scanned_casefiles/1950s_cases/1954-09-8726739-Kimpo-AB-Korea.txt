a. Time of Observation and maneuvers of objects prior to sighting the observer, the 
basis for calling other persons to view the object, and for observers finally reporting to 
headquarters. 

0013 - Sgt. JACKSON sighted the object to be about the size of a palm hand held at arms length.

d. Negative

e. Negative

f. Negative

g. Negative

h. Negative

2. Description of course of object

a. The initial sighting was made at the base telephone central switch located at the 
top floor of the KENPOO tower. Observers, including SFC (...) and PFC (...), called the 
object to the attention of upper base telephone station, who in turn located it from 
some buildings. Two other personnel observed the object and then phoned in the 
Control Tower.

b. The object was at approximately a 50 degree angle of elevation and 
at 175 degrees azimuth to the observers, when first observed.

c. The object was at approximately a 50 degree angle of elevation and at 
180 degrees azimuth to the observers upon disappearance.

d. The object moved in a westerly direction with a minimum of approximately 
175 degrees to 180 degrees, with no apparent change in elevation.

e. The object was obscured by clouds which were at 12,000 feet, seven-
tenths broken.

f. The object was observed for approximately eleven (11) to thirteen (13) 
minutes.

3. Manner of observation:

a. Object was observed by ground visual means 

b. Both control tower operators observed the object at 0557Z through 
0610Z for a 50 point binocular view. Numerous others observed the object, 
including T/Sgt. THEOFANOS who latterly describes its appearance as having a shape 
less bright than a piece resembling the glare of a strong sunlight 
on polished aluminum. THEOFANOS observed the object disappearing behind 
the gradual bank of blue sky.

12. The preliminary analysis of this office reveals that there is apparently no explanation to this sighting. The fact that a weather balloon was released

during the time of sighting has no apparent bearing on the sighting, since the balloon was never plotted in a southerly direction. The object observed,

The object was travelling on a southerly heading against the last wind at that

these reasons seem to eliminate the assumption that the object was the weather balloon released by the F-1L weather station. The radar station

had no plots in the F-1L area during the time the object was sighted.

On the 19 September 1954 at about 0557I I was standing outside of the weather station, located on the south side of the base, hanging weather balloons, when I happened to glance north. There, moving from east to west at an azimuth of about 175 degrees I spotted what appeared to be a bright star. The object was moving and I could not make it out as clearly as I had much rather it was standing still. I called the control tower operations at 0600I and informed A/3c Fowler to get a station through his cold glasses and see what he could make of it. The operator reported back at 0603I and informed me he also had located it. At 0608I clouds moved under the object, observing it he told me the object was still visible as it moved north easterly direction, passing from about 180 degrees to 175 degrees in azimuth. The object looked to be about the size of a pinhead with a bright light on it.

On the morning of 19 September at 0557I, while calling weather observation, I sighted what appeared to be a bright star. Before I hesitated to call it a star within a few seconds, the clouds under it raised, because of its magnitude and output, calling A/3c Sheldon who happened to be handling the door, I called the control tower to wrap up the object which I saw moving from east to west when we first sighted and moved the set until approximately due south of base within about two cylinder signs on the weather office. A/3c DOOGLE using cold glasses reports it continued the object until it disappeared behind a cloud. At 0608 clouds had covered the past position of the object. The object was slightly larger than a star and much lighter. It appeared to me like a reflection in the sun off of a very light-shiny object.

Observer

On the morning of 19 September at approximately 0557I I was called to the door on the south side of the weather station, by A/3c Park, and there pointed out to me what appeared to be a very bright star moving east to west, but I was quite positive it couldn’t be a star as it was moving from east to west. So I called the control tower operator and asked him to see what he could make of it through his cold glasses. He then continued to watch the object until it disappeared behind a cloud. It disappeared at about 0608I. The object appeared to be very bright and about the size of a star. At times it appeared to be flickering as sunlight does on a mirror as the mirror is tilted at various angles.

**UNCLASSIFIED**

**AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT**

**4th Fighter Interceptor Group Intelligence APO 75 
11- 54**

At approximately 0557i1, 19 September 1954 (2077i1 13 September 1954), Base Weather telephoned the tower and asked me to look towards the south to an object in the sky (a bright white light that resembled a star). I confirmed the object, so they asked me to look at it through the binoculars. I looked at the object through the binoculars and told them that it didn’t look like a star to me because it was much brighter and it appeared to be moving in a westerly direction. Weather asked that I also get the object to be watched. I asked them if it could be a weather balloon they said that it couldn’t be a balloon because it was moving in the wrong direction. I then called Combat Operations and gave them the above information. I continued to look through the binoculars until the object disappeared above clouds at about 060ost. I would estimate that the object was at about 175 azimuth degrees from the tower. It appeared to be at a very high altitude and at about 50 degrees elevation. Through the binoculars no streamers, tail, or specific structure could be seen, only a bright white light, similar to bright sunlight reflected by an aluminum surface. With the binoculars, the object appeared to be about the size of a pin-head.

**WESSLY SCHENAVER ACUSAF Tower Controller.**

At 0557i4 19 September 1954, the control tower received a telephone call from the Base Weather Section stating that weather personnel had under observation a bright object in the sky. The man on the telephone then went to the window with binoculars (7:50 power) to observe the object. He then pointed out the object to me and handed me the binoculars. I observed the object through the binoculars. The object was very bright, too bright to make out any specific shape or dimensions or to estimate its altitude. I then went out on the roof of the tower with the edge of the roof and the bright object. I kept this position for a minute and a half, during which the object appeared to be standing still. During that period clouds were moving rapidly from the west, giving the object an apparent motion in relation to the clouds. I then went back into the tower for a couple of minutes, and then went out and again visually lined up the roof edge with the object. The object appeared to have moved, but only slightly. The sky was clouding up very rapidly and at 060ost the object was obscured by clouds at about 180 degrees azimuth.
