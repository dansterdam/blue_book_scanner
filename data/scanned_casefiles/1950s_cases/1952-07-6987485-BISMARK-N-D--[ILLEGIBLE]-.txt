INTELLIGENCE REPORT
WBASHINGTON, D.C.
30 JULY 1952

PART B - OW STANINE'S CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING AIRCRAFT

On Monday, July 28, 1952, at 11:40 p.m., two or more objects were observed over Bismarck, North Dakota. These objects were in two separate groups, varying in an erratic direction. These objects were of a fantastic nature, extremely brilliant, and maneuvering in the sky in a most incredible manner. The objects were sighted by many witnesses, including reliable civilians, and they were observed for approximately 20 minutes. The objects were round in shape, estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and were completely silent. No vapor trails nor exhaust were visible. The objects were described as being a bright white light, similar to a magnesium flare, and were seen to make extremely rapid stops and starts, 90 degree turns and complete reversals of direction. The objects were also seen to hover motionless at times, and then to accelerate to an extremely high rate of speed and disappear.

Following this incident, an Air Force jet interceptor was scrambled and was airborne within 10 minutes in an attempt to intercept the objects. However, the objects disappeared before the interceptor could make contact. Our intelligence impressions were that the performance of the objects was such that they were technically far in advance of any known aircraft at the present time.

TEXT OUTPUT:

30 JULY 1952
TRUE S.CB. STATEMENTS CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING AIRCRAFT
On 27 June, July 22, 1952, at 9:10 a.m. we observed two silver or 
aluminum colored objects for several minutes in an easterly direction. 
The objects were in formation, appearing to be controlled aircraft.
They were silvery bright, some elongated and others rounded in shape.
They moved in a jerky, erratic fashion, accelerating rapidly, their speed
being far greater than any jet aircraft. They were clearly defined and, in our opinion, no controlled aircraft as we know them could perform such maneuvers. They appeared to be about 1000 feet high and
traveled for some 30 to 60 seconds, then disappeared from sight in a 
rapid upward motion.
I was an airplane spotter on the east coast during the last war and did have a total of 1,150 hours doing this work. I am familiar with all presently qualified to fly aircraft and what they can do. These objects were, in my opinion, something strange and, while I cannot
offer any solution, I can state that they were not of a conventional
nature in any way, shape or form. They presented a strange and baffling
phenomenon to us both.
