BRIEF SWORN STATEMENT CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING AIRCRAFT

On Monday, July 28, 1952, at ten A.M., we observed two silvery or metallic objects directly north in a sky which was traveling in an easterly direction. These objects were in formation, moving to be equidistant from one another, and remaining at the same altitude, approximately a 45 degree angle from the horizontal long as they were in sight. They were slightly pointed and were, in our opinion, not smaller than a B-29 (if a circle were drawn from wing tip to wing tip and from nose to tail) nor larger than a B-36. The impressions were that objects were traveling at a high rate of speed as they were visible to us for only fifteen to twenty seconds. There was a sound of a motor, or motor, almost simultaneously - but this sound was in the north or northwest. While the objects were in the north, we were unable to detect any windows; but if these objects were divided into quarters, it would be noted with the exceptions of the lower left quarter, Wales was slightly flattened and black or darkened at the edge. We were impressed by how quickly these disappeared from sight. It is our estimate that they were not over eight miles distant. These objects were like nothing else we had ever seen and we feel there is every reason to believe that it is entirely possible that they are of flying or meteoric origin.

Following this incident, at ten minutes after ten, we observed three F-51 Mustang fighter planes flying from Southwest or South to East.

I, being having an airplane spotter on the east coast during the last war and did have a total of 150 hours doing this work. I feel somewhat qualified to say that this object was completely different from any aircraft which I saw at that time or have seen since. Having lived in Zeeland, an area familiar with 1-36's and can see no connection between them and the objects I saw.

TRUE STORY STATEMENT CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING AIRCRAFT

On 'onday, July 21, 1952, at ten a.m., we observed two silver or luminous objects literally north in a 15 degree angle traveling in an easterly direction. These objects were in formation, appearing to be equidistant from one another, and remaining at the same altitude, approximately a 45 degree angle. From the horizon, as long as they were in sight, they were clearly defined and were, in our opinion, no small or this a B-17 (if a circle were drawn from wing tip to wing tip end from nose to tail) nor is there than a B-24. Our impression was that objects were traveling at a high rate of speed as they were visible to us for only fifteen to twenty seconds. There was a sound of a motor, or motors, simultaneously, but this soon went to the south-west while the objects were in the north. We were unable to detect any windows; but it either of these objects were divided into quarters, it would be roughly what one could call a quarter-watch, appeared to be slightly flattened and black or darkened at the edge.

We were impressed by how quickly these disappeared from sight. It is also our opinion, that were not over eight miles distant. These objects were like nothing else either of us has ever seen, and we feel there is every reason to believe that it is entirely possible that they are of alien origin.

Following this incident, at ten minutes after ten, we observed three F-51 Mustang fighter planes flying from southeast or South to East.

1. [REDACTED], was an airplane spotter on the east coast during the last war and did have a total of 150 hours doing this work. I feel somewhat qualified to say that this object was, completely different from any aircraft which I am at this or have seen since. Having lived in Dallas, I am also familiar with B-36's and can see no connection between them and the objects I saw.

Fifteen objects moving at high speed were sighted flying five miles from Sanford atomic plant.
