25 January 1951

SUBJECT: Report on Indicated Airborne Target over Oak Ridge Area.

TO: Procilla CSI Detachment
P.O. Box 401
Knoxville, Tenn

On 21 January 1951 at 1500 o'clock while on a practice flight of the F-84 aircraft the radar operator of aircraft 44-472, intercepted an indication of an airborne target at a range of 10-12 miles. The pilot in the F-84, 1st Lt. [redacted] who notified GCI, GCI gave the co-head to intercept same.

The radar net was blocked out to the target and the run began. The interception on the "G" scan (northwest) indicated the target was varying altitude between ten and twenty-five degrees above the intercepting aircraft's altitude which was 7M feet. A range of approximately 10 yards was indication on cloverleaf by a descent until the 11:45 of penetration or the target was reached. At this point the pilot dropped into a nose down altitude and the target was again picked up and indicated the "AO" scan plane of GK filter. The interception was broken two miles west of the Atomic City Area where it was to be "swept" for the other aircraft. On the next run in the area the "target" was again indicated on a second run made on GN. At the completion of the flight, period the radar observer requested one more run over the area to again check for the same type indication. The pilot started the run from approximately 40 miles and again at 20 degrees indicated and locked a/c. This time the run was completed to the limit of the antenna depression and then broke off because the line of fill it again was across the Oak Ridge tract. This phenomenon was duly reported to local GSL.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

(Refer S/F Subject as above dated 20 January 1951 pertaining to the sighting at 2145 hours on 16 January 1951)

At approximately 1545 hours on 15 January 1951, an unusually brilliant object was sighted by two persons at the Central Energy Project, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Attached hereto is the statement concerning this phenomenon. The weather at the time of this sighting is substantially the same as reported in the previous report for 16 January 1951, as referred to above.

Records of the 663rd A.C. & W Squadron, (radar), McGhee Tyson Airport, Knoxville, Tennessee reveal that no aircraft were in the vicinity at the time of the observation, and the radar site was receiving no interference.

At 1620 hours on 21 January 1951, a radar sighting of an unidentified object over Oak Ridge, Tennessee was made by the airborne radar equipment in a P-82 fighter aircraft of the 5th Air Force Squadron, 2nd Fighter Group, McGhee Tyson, airport, Knoxville, Tennessee. This radar interference was received by the airborne radar as the aircraft approached the Y-10 plant area in the "controlled zone" of the Atomic Energy Project, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The fighter aircraft attempted to pick this target from various angles and found that the source of the interference could not be located from the area or the field that, to visual reference to anything in the sky was reported by either the pilot or the radar operator of the P-82 aircraft.

The weather at the time of this incident is reportedly: "Partly cloudy, with east winds at seven (7) miles per hour. Temperature 58 degrees, and dewpoint 19 degrees. No billows or other weather apparatus was in the sky at this time. Between the hours 1545 and 1615, the wind was variable from south to northeast at from calm to eleven (11) miles per hour.

Attached hereto is a copy of the letter submitted by 1st Lieutenant, U.S.A.F., concerning this phenomenon. (NOTE: The letter "n" used in this letter denotes "thousand").

1. It is considered highly probable that the radar target detected three times by the airborne radar set in the F-82 aircraft on 21 January was a ground target in the vicinity of the X-10 plant.

2. The peculiar phenomena of having the target first appear at an altitude above the interceptor and then below the aircraft is considered to be due to abnormal refraction of the radar electromagnetic emanations. The airborne radar transmitted energy was refracted to the ground by a "temperature and/or moisture duct" that was located at about the same altitude as the interceptor; more details are given in paragraph 3 below. When the interceptor closed on the target, the target first appeared to be above the interceptor until the apex of the band rays was reached, and after that the target appeared below the interceptor.

3. A check with the local AMC base weather office indicates that the Nashville weather station reported the following temperature data for 2100 EST, 21 January 1951:

Altitude       Temperature Conditions
0 to 2000 ft   No Change
2000 to 5000 ft Six degree increase
5000 to 8000 ft Normal decrease in temp/increased altitude
8000 to 11000 ft Three degree decrease
Above 11000 ft Normal decrease in temp/increased altitude

ROUTING AND [partially cut off] UNCLASSIFIED

PROJECT 1C073

TO MCIAXL-1a FROM MCIAXE DATE 16 FEB 1951 COMMENT NO. 1

1. It is suggested that substantially the following to be used in replying to the attached letter, insofar as the report on the radar detected target is concerned:

*1. It is considered highly probable that the radar target detected three times by the airborne radar set in the T-92 aircraft on 21 January was a ground target in the vicinity of the X-10 plant.

*2. The peculiar phenomena of having the target first appear at an altitude above the interceptor and then below the aircraft is considered to be due to abnormal refraction of the radar electromagnetic emanations. The T-92 airborne radar transmitted energy was refracted to the ground by a temperature and/or moisture duct that was located at about the same altitude as the interceptor; more details are given in paragraph 3 below. When the interceptor closed on the target, the target first appeared to be above the interceptor until the apex of the bent radar 'rays' was reached, and after that the target appeared below the interceptor.

*3. A check with the local AIC base weather office indicates that the Nashville weather station reported the following temperature data for 2100 EST, 21 January 1951:

Altitude        Temperature Conditions
0 to 2000 ft    No change
2000 to 5000 ft Six degree increase
5000 to 8000 ft Normal decrease in temp/increased altitude
8000 to 11000 ft Three degree increase
Above 11000 ft Normal decrease in temp/increased altitude

The normal atmospheric temperature condition is that temperature decreases nearly linearly with increase in altitude. The above data indicates that two inversion layers existed, one above the interceptor and one below, not about. The data further showed that the Oak Ridge area was reported. While complete and accurate effects of temperature inversion are not thoroughly understood, it is considered that this effect caused the detection of a ground target. To appear to be airborne, first above and then below the interceptor as the interceptor closed on the target.

The normal atmospheric temperature condition is that temperature decreases nearly linearly with increase in altitude. The above data indicates that two inversion layers existed, one above the interceptor and one below, at about the "ine the airborne radar target over the Oak Ridge area was reported. While complete and accurate effects of temperature inversion are not thoroughly understood, it is considered that this effect caused the detection of a ground target to appear to be airborne, first above and then below the interceptor as the interceptor closed on the target.

4. In view of the lack of factual evidence relative to the visual sightings covered in the report, no positive explanation can be offered, however, there are several possible explanations for this sighting.
