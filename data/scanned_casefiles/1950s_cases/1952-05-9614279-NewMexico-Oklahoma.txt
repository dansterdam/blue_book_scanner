Sightings of Unidentified Aerial Objects
Southwestern United States
4 June 1952

1. During a night training mission on 23 May 1952, five F-86 aircraft of this command reported sightings of unidentified objects. Apparently illuminated by a very bright light, they appeared to be disc-shaped and were estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 25,000 feet. The objects were observed at a distance of approximately 2-3 miles and were visible for 10 to 15 seconds.

2. Other sightings were made in the vicinity of this airfield, most of Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 4 June 1952. Numerous reports were received from airline pilots, flight crews, and others, describing objects of varying sizes and shapes, with a variety of color characteristics. The objects were observed at distances ranging from a few miles to 25 or 30 miles, and altitudes from a few hundred feet to over 40,000 feet. Duration of the sightings ranged from a few seconds to over 10 minutes.

3. Weather experiences at the time and places of sightings were as follows:
0343 LST 4 Jun 52: Wind 110 deg 5 kt, Temp 70 deg F, Sky Cov 0, Alt 29.98 in 
0349 LST 4 Jun 52: Wind 260 deg 7 kt, Temp 68 deg F, Sky Cov 0, Alt 29.99 in
0355 LST 4 Jun 52: Wind 290 deg 10 kt, Temp 67 deg F, Sky Cov 0, Alt 29.99 in
0409 LST 4 Jun 52: Wind 270 deg 10 kt, Temp 68 deg F, Sky Cov 0, Alt 30.00 in

4. There was no photographic evidence to account for what was observed. No attempt to intercept or fire upon the objects was made.

5. As yet, nothing is known that can be considered as a satisfactory explanation to account for the characteristics of the unidentified objects sighted.
