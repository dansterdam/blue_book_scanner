1. During a night training mission on 28 May 1952, five B-29 aircraft of this
command reported sightings of unidentified objects, closely resembling "very large"
and colored somewhat to be white, spread in a circular, military and navy
vicinity for less than a minute. All sightings were visual. Objects appeared to
travel from or in an arc toward the ground. Lateral path was one compass, which was
to trail off toward the ground. The size of the objects could not be determined
with any accuracy, however, about one hundred yards is estimated.

2. Three sightings were made in the vicinity of Otto radios, east of Albuquerque,
New Mexico, by B-29's flying at approximately 16,000 feet. Sightings were:
First - at 0302 28 May 1952 at 35°00'N, 106°19'W; at 0302 cover miles east of
Otto radios, at 0305 approximately 16 miles southwest of Albuquerque, at 0302 by a B-29 flying at 25,000 feet, described as ten miles southwest of Tulsa,
Oklahoma. The last sighting was also at 25,000 feet at 0333N described as fifteen
miles northwest of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

3. Weather responses at the times and places of sightings were as follows:
   Otto radios, 0330z, 29 May 1952
   0 15 136/6/93                 14/M/97 2098

   Tulsa, Oklahoma, 0330z, 29 May 1952
   0 15 191/4/93                 6/8/mg

4. There were no known activities in the areas of sighting and to account for what was
seen. No physical evidence or photographic was obtained and no intercept or
identification action was taken.

5. Crews making these reports appeared to be familiar with the characteristics of
aircraft and expressed the opinion that the objects were not meteors.
