Subject: Unidentified aerial object (meteor ?)

Sirs:

Not knowing what Government agency is interested in reports and description of unusual aerial objects, I decided to write to you, thinking you would have some interest in such reports, or could advise me where to send them.

Last September (1959) I sighted by chance an object moving through the sky in the manner of a meteor. It was larger than most meteors, however, and was bright green.

The local newspapers had reported a day or two before that several green objects had been sighted in the early evening and were thought to be meteors. The object that I sighted was seen in the middle of the night, and I read no reports of it. I wrote down as detailed data as I could, all angles, etc. being estimated since I had no instruments.

If you should be interested in the data that I put down, I will be glad to send it to you. It will cover about one page, typewritten.

It was only recently that I decided it might be of some interest or value. If this subject is not of direct interest to your organization, I will appreciate it if you will send this letter to the proper agency.

Yours truly,

[Signature redacted]

Dear Mr.

This is in further response to your letter of August 8, 1960, in which you report the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

We wish to thank you for your interest in submitting the information contained in your letter. As you may know, a number of similar observations have been reported for which there is no particularly satisfactory explanation. This agency has neither the assignment nor the facilities to investigate such occurrences. We have, therefore, forwarded your letter to the Department of the Air Force which has the primary responsibility for investigating this type of phenomenon.

Very truly yours,

James A. Holcomb

REPLY TO

SUBJECT: UFO Sightings

TO: SAFOI-3d (L/Col)

1. Attached are copies of letters which were forwarded to ATIC by the CAA and the NASA reporting the sighting of unidentified flying objects. The information contained in these letters is not sufficient for a conclusion to be reached by ATIC; therefore, request ATIC Forms #164 be sent to the witnesses for their compilation and forwarding directly to this Center, Attn: AFCIN-462x.

2. Addresses of the witnesses are as follows:
[Redacted] Lanett, Alabama
[Redacted] Williamsburg, Virginia

3. If the above witnesses know of any other witnesses to the sightings, request this information be included in their reports.

4 April 1961

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your letter of August 8, 1960, addressed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was referred to this office April 3, 1961.

The Air Force is assigned the responsibility for investigating all reports of unusual aerial objects over the U.S., including those that became labeled unidentified flying objects.

To insure adequate evaluation of these sightings it is necessary that cases be reported as soon as possible after sighting and that complete information be included. Since the sighting made by you occurred in 1959 it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to render an evaluation that would lead to a conclusion. However, I am enclosing ATIC Form #164 for you to complete if you so desire. The completed form should be mailed to: Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, ATTN: ATIC-4B2x.

For your information, I am also enclosing a copy of the latest Department of Defense fact sheet, Air Force UFO Report.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Very truly yours,

   took off 2333Z. No sighting reported.

K. The preparing officers is Captain Greenberg, Max W.
Intelligence HQ. 4th Tac Ftr Wg. This object was also seen from
the ground by the following Seymour Johnson personnel: Major Lundy,
Glenn E, Pilot, OPS Off 4TACTFWG, Lt. Gaffney, John t, Pilot
INT TACFTRWG, S/Sgt Smith, Larry, Control Tower Tech, 7 years
experience 1043-1 AACS, Seymour Johnson AFB, N.C. They all agreed
that the object was round with a long tail blue green in color
and no sound. They also agreed that the object was traveling
parallel to the ground at approximately 30 degrees elevation,
and then suddenly disappeared. The description of the size of
the object varied from the size of a orange to the size of a
baseball. Although each one reported the altitude as constant
their estimated range from where officer, here, Lt. Bates called
it a meteor, however, he was puzzled by the level flight and
low altitude. The direction of travel is contrary to known man made
satellites.

N.C. 1. None-no radar pickup by AG & W Site at Kure Beach.
