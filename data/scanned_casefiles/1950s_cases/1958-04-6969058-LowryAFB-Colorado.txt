Here is the text from the document:

does not apply to the real moon, but represents an average. In 1818 and 1819, for example, the full moon came on Easter day and caused considerable questioning from those who thought the full applied to the body they saw in the sky.

First Eclipse of 1958

April also brings the first eclipse of 1958, but it will not be visible in any part of North America, except Alaska. This happens on April 18, when the moon will come directly between earth and sun. However, the moon will be far enough away that it will appear slightly smaller than the sun and thus will not completely cover it.

Even where the solar eclipse is at its height, along a path that starts in the Indian Ocean, southeast of India, crosses Burma, Thailand, Viet Nam and Formosa and ends in the Pacific Ocean southeast of Japan, one would see a ring of the bright solar surface around the dark disc of the moon. Thus it is called an annular eclipse, since "annulus" is Latin for ring. Along the first part of this path it will be April 19 at the eclipse occurs. But the path crosses the International Date Line where it is still the 18th, so the event may be said to occur the day before it begins!

Over a larger area, covering all of Asia except the northwestern port, the Indian Ocean, Indonesia and the western Pacific, as well as Alaska, there will be a partial eclipse, with the moon hiding a part of the sun. By our time reckoning, the eclipse occurs during the night of the 18th.

                                                                St. Paul, Minnesota

April 29, 1958, St. Paul, Minnesota:
A UFO similar to the one reported in the east on April 21 was sighted by control tower operators at Wold-Chamberlain Airport and by other observers. The CAA men said the UFO did not resemble a meteor or any other known object but that it moved west to east at high speed on an even path without climbing or descending.

It was described as emitting sparks from its glowing nose before its abrupt disappearance. The UFO also was seen by NICAP member H. T. Sherman, insurance underwriter and astronomer, who reported it to an Air Force Captain Nueman at Wold - Chamberlain. The captain first suggested Venus, which Sherman quickly ruled out. The captain then suggested a meteor, "too slow," stated Mr. Sherman. "A partial path and the UFO's appearance rules that out."

Finally Captain Nueman suggested a new anti-collision light on a plane, but Sherman pointed out these items.

• When the light went out no plane was visible in the sky which at 9 p.m. was still fairly light.

• He would have heard any aircraft.

• No pilot in his right mind would approach a field with such heavy traffic at such high speed and suddenly at low altitude turn out all lights.

The Air Force captain found no other suggestions and the sighting was officially recorded.

Dear Captain:

I now have had a chance to look through all the reports you sent, and the one concerning the "satellite-gypo sighting" from Denver interests me very much and I am giving it the full treatment. It is clear that this could not have been any of the American satellites, not only because of the excessive brightness, but because no American satellite is presently known as being approaching from the northwest at the latitude of Denver. On April 30th there were no known Russian Sputnik's up, but even had there been it is almost inconceivable that two such bright orbital objects would escape detection by our moonwatch teams. This is a corker so much so, that I wish I had the time to talk to some two officers. It could be that in casual conversation some clue might be obtained which is not apparent in their report.

I had an experience the other night which may bear on this. I had been instructing my young daughter in figural sidereal time, and we had come out to check calculations when there can along a sputnik-like object--correct brightness, correct speed, correct color, and I almost stood aghast. There was no sound. A few minutes later another such object came through in another direction, and then a few minutes still another. On the third one I was able to detect over ambient noises the sound of jet motors. Lights were not blinking. If the other object had not been there I honestly might be puzzled to this day as to whether I had seen an unknown satellite. I didn't know that jets ever carried such lights.

It is almost inconceivable two such experienced officers could have made the mistake I had first made, but strange things do happen. In the meantime, I am having this observation checked against all other "unknown sputniks" that our teams from time to time report.

As to the other cases, which I am returning (I will return the Denver case very soon), we certainly seem to have a fine bunch of astronomical observations--two of them. The others remain one, the object that was seen the same time on two nights just before sunrise.

Here is the text from the document:

(period of morning twilight had already begun). Were was, as you say, near the point of sighting but it seems to me that it was somewhat higher than 60°. There was a very fine particular object in the sky at that time but, unfortunately, in the southeastern sky. The planet Venus was its brightest pre-sunrise sky, and I know from past experience how easily it can be mistaken for an unknown object. My only reaction is to question the stated position and to comment the possibility as it was Venus.

The case of the "daylight meteor" is greatly ambiguous. While a daylight (fireball) cannot be ruled out, I would myself favor the accidental release of some object from an aircraft. However, much hinges on the statement "flames". If it really was flaming, then it looks as though we must accredit this to a daylight meteor. If the light was simply a bright reflection of sunlight, then we have the other possibility. In either case, there is nothing to do in an investigation to be able to distinguish between daylight meteor or object falling from aircraft. I don't think it is worthwhile to pursue this one, although I think I could talk to the chap a better analysis might be due. It just occurs to me that perhaps the object might have been a burst weather or cosmic ray balloon, with the reflection from the trail, contributing to the diameter of object.

In fact, I think this is a distinct possibility since it occurred in the neighborhood of the municipal airport from which, I suppose, balloons are launched. The time of the time of such launchings, so, three possibilities: daylight meteor, burst balloon. All harmless but, I now tend to prefer the latter.

I am looking forward to visiting you in your new quarters---

Cheers,

ASTRONOMY
Jupiter Now Most Prominent
April is the month that will see the planet Jupiter
nearest to the earth, in addition to bringing the first solar
eclipse of the year.

By JAMES STOKLEY

IN A DIRECTION from the earth directly opposite to the earth's direction, the giant planet Jupiter will make its
closest approach of the year, at a distance of 413,000,000 miles. It will then be most prominent, visible all night with a bright
mass of minus two on the astronomical magnitude scale.

Jupiter is shown on the accompanying maps, which depict the sky at 8 p.m. about 10:30 p.m., your own kind of standard time. At the first of April, an hour earlier at the middle and two hours earlier at the end. It is toward the southeast, in Virgo, the virgin, just past the meridian. In the brightest star in that constellation, though Spica is among the 20 brightest stars in the sky (those of the first magnitude or brighter), Jupiter now surpasses it in brilliance.

High in the west, the lion, with another bright star, Leo, the lion's heart, which is in a group of six stars often called the "sickle," is prominent in the firmament.

To the right of Leo is the rather faint constellation of Cancer, but next to that is the figure of Gemini, with Sirius. Here we find Pollux, also of magnitude one. Below Gemini is Cancer with Castor and Procyon, and below that stands the great star Canopus Mijar, with Sirius, the dog star.

This is now so low that it is faint and relatively inconspicuous, quite different from the way it looked on midwinter evenings when it was in the southern sky.

Orion is Faint

The same is true of Orion, to the west telescopically, the brightest star in this figure of the winter sky. As the sky is now the three stars that mark his belt - Rigel, Betelgeuse, and Mintaka - are now below the belt, has passed below the horizon. It may be seen only in the evening twilight.

To the right of Orion is Taurus, the bull, in which we see Aldebaran. On account of its low altitude, and the consequent increased atmospheric absorption by the earth's atmosphere, it is represented by the symbol for a second-magnitude star, although it is really of the first. Aside from Aldebaran, the brightest star in Taurus is Capella.

High in the eastern sky, above and to the left of Jupiter, is the figure of Bootes, the herdsman. Here we find Arcturus, Bootes' brightest star, which is the brightest star in the northwestern horizon. Vega, which is in Lyra, the lyre, is shown. Actually, of all the stars that can be seen from these latitudes, only Sirius surpasses Vega in brightness.

over the equator. The next full moon is on April 3, so the following Sunday, April 6, is Easter. And from the date of Easter are determined the dates of certain other religious "movable feasts."

The Easter Moon

The Easter rule was set in 325 A.D. by the Council of Nicaea. Before that there were two principal factions in the early church with their own ideas as to when the festival should be celebrated.

The Crucifixion and Resurrection led them to place at the time of the Hebrew Passover, which begins on the 14th day of the month of Nisan in the Jewish calendar. Since each month in this calendar begins with the new moon, it is always full at the 14th. Hence when Christ arose from the dead it was a time of full moon and, also, it happened on a Sunday.

One group wanted to celebrate Easter always at the time of the full moon, but the others thought that the day of the week was important. They wanted it on Sunday, and the Nicene Council decided in their favor.

They fixed the rule that Easter should come on the Sunday following the 14th day of the moon when the full moon may occur on the 20th; sometimes it may come on the 22nd, while the full moon may not necessarily come on the 14th day of the lunar month. Thus, the rule
