10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Objects sighted first as lights about the size of automobile headlights, but non-directional in nature, color white tinged with yellow. The number was six changing to five after a few minutes. Thera was some sound, but remained observers more of reciprocating aircraft than jet. After a few minutes objects changed from a string formation to a "V", one light faded out, and the other five climbed out of sight.

A telephone check with Grandview AFB Operations Office revealed no jet aircraft formations at the time of this sighting which were operating out of the base at that location, but aircraft could have been from another base in another area.
