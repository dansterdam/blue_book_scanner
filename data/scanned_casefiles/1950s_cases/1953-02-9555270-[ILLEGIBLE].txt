At 2110 hours, 26 February 1953, D/7 called operations and told us about a red light at about 270 degrees at approximately fifteen (15) miles from this station. I went out and took a look at the light which appeared to be about 270 degrees and about fifteen (15) miles, between 500 to 600 feet in altitude. I called the Japanese guard and asked him if he had a pair of field glasses and he said that he left them at the main gate. There were two (2) guards here at the time, so I asked one of them to go down to the gate and get the field glasses. I went back into the Operations building and A/3C Rhea came back and said that he observed the light going out and reported the same to me. This occurred at 2117 hours. I called the Parker and reported the incident to him. We set one scope on short range and expanded the observation area to about 25 miles on the face of the scope. We didn't have anything that looked unnatural on the scope at the time. There were quite a lot of fishing boats in the area at the time. The light was red and looked to be about ten (10) feet in diameter when I observed it. Hirata called and told us that, if known, some light of the same sort of light about forty (40) miles per hour and on a heading of 360 degrees. A/3C Rhea called Nigata Controller and told him about it and we gave them the first plot at 2238 hours. The Flash was killed at 2319 hours and was identified as surface vessels. Doing that same time, D/7 called and told us that another had seen three (3) of the same sort of lights that were orange.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2110 hours, 26 February 1953, I saw an orange ball in the sky about forty miles away and approximately 1,500 to 2,500 feet in altitude. I immediately reported it to the crew chief at operations, W W McCollum. After that, I proceeded to watch the ball again. As I watched it, it changed colors, first from orange to red and then to orange-red. At no time did it seem to move from it's position. At 2120 hours, it disappeared.

At 2300 hours, 26 February 1953, a light appeared in the water, which seemed to be the light of a flaming boat leaving at great speed. It's range and bearing was the same as the ball mentioned above. At (20) minutes, it too vanished. At 2325 hours, a red streak appeared from the water rose to approximately height of two-hundred (200) feet, and fell into the water. It's range was forty (40) to fifty (50) miles, at a bearing of about 310 degrees.

D/T JADE Comment:
    (Reference also TR 3-53, 311th ACGW Group; TR 2-53, 27th ACGW Group; and
    TR 2-53, TR 1-53 from 528th ACGW Group.)

    Although this report involves an object sighting on 26 Feb 53 (See TR's referenced hereto), it has been considered as a "Reporting Unusual Incidents" report
    rather than as a FURORE. For this reason, the reporting personnel determined the
    object sighted to be other than an "unidentified Flying Object", as stimulated in
    AFR 200-2.

    This Headquarters has received a later message from the reporting agency which
    stated that further investigation determined the object sighted to have been the
    plane VENUS.

    Site 10 was reported also in this late message to have seen VENUS on 26 Feb 53.

    This Headquarters has no further information that would warrant altering this
    explanation of sighting.

ATIC Document 123865, Northwest Hokkaido, Japan

At approximately 2100J, 25 Feb 53, an unidentified airborne object was reported seen by several members of an ACW Squadron. The object changed colors from red to pink-orange and then to white. Sighted by several members of the detachment. The object appeared to move slowly toward the horizon then abruptly disappeared. Azimuth and elevation readings at 2155 hours on the 25th was 285 degrees from true north and 18 degrees 12 minutes above horizontal.

One member of the observing party, an Air Force major, stated that he believed the object was an obvious star or planet.

ATIC Comment: Azimuth and elevation readings indicate that the sighted object was the planet Venus, Dr. [REDACTED], ATIC astronomer, concurs with this evaluation.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING AGENCIES: Although the reliability of the observers is good, does not discount the possibility that the object was a planet or star. The plan was to gain the same personal direction at time of sighting, and is a ORIENT OF NEXT. Reporting officer's evaluation of this report is GOOD. This report was not accomplished on the proper detailed date due to the lack of transportation for sighting reports from Detachment 17 to this headquarters for period of 26 Feb to 5 Mar 53.

NARRATIVE

At 2100/I, 20 Feb 53, I observed an unidentified object, with a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars at 1000 feet altitude, approximately 5 miles distance and 100 yards to the left of the lighthouse due west of Detachment #3, (Shimo Shima). Will 1640. The object's size appeared to be about 30 miles in diameter, with a blinking effect of object that may have been caused by atmospheric conditions between our D/F tower and object. The object appeared to move very light green with a brief white center.

(Rest of first paragraph is partially illegible)

On the night of 20 Feb 53, I was working as operations floor supervisor at Detachment #3, when at 2115/I, Fukuoka D/F reported a strange light west of this station. I ran out of operations and observed a bright star-like running object, about 30 miles due west of my position, at a distance of about 30 miles and altitude of two to three thousand feet. In size, it was about twice as big as a bright evening star. This was through 7267.

During the time I observed this light, it did not move. The sky was clear at the time. I returned to operations and then went back outside at 2145/I. By this time, the light or object had disappeared.

STATEMENT

The object was first sighted on 26 Feb 53 at 2115/I, 270 degrees from Detachment 17 (WJMZ 0746) at an altitude of 3,000 feet at an estimated distance of 20 miles. Location of the object was approximately 1,900+13, -,4045'N. It was the shape of a star in the sky of any star in the sky at the time of sighting. It was too far away to observe any aerodynamic features, although there was a very distinct pulsating from orange to white. The object was a near orange. There was no noticeable sound or lateral movement to the object. It seemed to get lower and dimmer indicating that possibly it was traveling away from the vicinity. Observed first disappeared at 2125/I, with the color ranging from white to deep orange. The object faded completely at 2134/I and that was the final observation. No air traffic was made or identified during the sighting. My location was west side of the DF tower. The weather during the sighting was very clear and calm.

D/T TAG Comment:

(Reference also IR 3-55, 516th ACGW Group; and IR 1-53, IR 2-53, IR 3-53 from 328th ACGW Group)

There were sightings while with a series of sightings recorded on 26 Feb 53 which ranged the Western coast of Japan from Kyushu to Hokkaido. Of the seven (7) sightings recorded on this date, all but two (2), Sites 3 and 17 (this report), have been reasonably well explained by further investigation on the part of personnel at the reporting sites.

IR 1-53 (report on Site 20) indicates object sighted to be a star.

IR 1-53 (report on Site 6) suggests the possibility that aircraft may have been the object sighted. A further report from the reporting agency last 3-29 aircraft over Yokota were definitely determined to be involved in this sighting.

IR 1-53 (report on Site 3), which suggests the possibility that a lighthouse may have been the object sighted, has been amplified by a further report from the reporting agency which stated that additional investigation determined that object sighted was a lighthouse.

IR 1-53 (report on Site 10) was supplemented by an additional late report from the reporting agency which stated that the object sighted was determined to be the planet VENUS.

The weather section at this Headquarters confirms the legitimacy of initial explanation that VENUS, or a bright star, could have caused the phenomenon related to these sightings.

This Headquarters believes that, in all probability, Sites 3 and 17 also may have seen VENUS, or a bright star.

1. Description: Object was round 3 or 4 times larger than a star, reddish-
orange, moving very slow almost unoticeable.
Time of initial sighting: Visual sighting was made at 2230 Item, 26 Feb.
1953.

2. Manner of sighting: Sighting was visual by site personnel.
3. Location of observer: Observers were at Site # 4 (Shirai), Honshu, Japan, 
35 degrees 45 minutes N - 136 degrees 25 minutes E.

4. Identifying Information: See paragraph 1.
5. Weather and winds: Weather was CALM temperature 36 degrees.
6. Possible explanation of sighting: See narrative.
7. Physical evidence: None, no radar contacts.
8. Action taken: Notified all sites to stay on alert for unusual sightings,
no further action.
9. Air Traffic: No aircraft of any type in vicinity.

NARRATIVE:

    At 2230.5 February 1953 at Site # 4 a reddish-orange object was
sighted at azimuth of 265 degrees, elevation of about 20 degrees across the
horizon. The object was about 3 or 4 times larger than nearest bright star;
appeared to move toward horizon to about 5 degrees and fade, reappear at 30
degrees and move down to horizon and again fade. This was repeated three(3)
times. Last seen at 2245. for a total of 15 minutes.

COMMENT OF PREPARING OFFICER:
    Personnel who were interviewed by intelligence officer, 528th
ACSW Gp., both were of the opinion that they would not have reported the incident
if the object had not been well defined. It was slow moving so slow
it was hardly noticeable. The object moved in same path for the 3 times it was
observed. No radar contacts were made and no anti-aircraft weapons were fired.
No photographs were taken.

    Possible explanation for sightings. At 2110L, 26 Feb. 1953, all radar sites
in central area of Honshu, Japan, were alerted to watch for unusual sightings.
Object sighted at heading of 265 degrees from site which would indicate air-
craft flying at Yakota or Tachikawa that are not plotted by OCI if the aircraft
were flying in their local area. No aircraft were flying at Johnson, and the
weather search lights at Yakota and Tachikawa were on.

NARRATIVE: At approximately 2315 hours, 26 Feb 53, Detachment 4, 5th
Weather Recon Sqdn (Heavy), 36 degrees 37 minutes N, 116 degrees 16 minutes W
was located by Land-Line from McChord AFB, Wash. 6 miles, 37 degrees N, altitude
1,159 degrees 06 minutes W. At they had been observing flashing lights along the
ground in an area approximately 6 miles long. A request was made to another unit
requiring a weather be assigned to watch the object.

Two were reported early, a flashing yellow light, apparently not ground
outside. The time of sighting was at 2230. A/C type aircraft was light
flashing a beacon, then a red, and then magenta. Two observers. At the location of 36-37 N, 116-16 W.

Radar also observed yellow light. At 36 degrees N, 116 degrees W, the
in turn. Approximate position, unknown. At 2230, (check), via radio, Capt
(color), Detachment 6 Commander, to advise a report. See enclosure 1.
(JIG) was informed. Advise desire if possible clarifying
in area. Japanese Coast Patrol will notify if any further action.
Freighter was in the area also. See enclosure 1.

A/C McFarland also observed yellow flashing light in same area from the
Operations tower. See enclosure 3.

In consensus, all four airmen and the Detachment Commander observed the
same light, same flashing characteristics, same color and approximately the
same location and distance from the ground. Observation, temperature was
limited; moonlight night, this weather, temperature approximately 36 degrees.
The light was observed to be on a metallic bearing of 210 degrees between 15
to 20 miles in distance and was a level or very close ground. No meaning
stationary throughout the night. Pictures (4 exposures) were taken with
negative results.

The Navy was contacted with negative aircraft or surface vessels in the
area. Negative radar pickup on subject light.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: This officer believes the light observed was
from one or two light houses west of the site on approximate heading of 240
degrees. Both using a flashing red signal. Further evidence would be that
the light remained stationary repeated same warning signal last night at
0600 and 27 Feb 53 for an estimated time of approximately six (6) hours.

CONTENT:

At approximately 2131, 26 Feb 53, while on duty as a Radar Operator, this detachment, I received a call on land line from Lt. Boos at Mitigta and he requested to know if we had been any strange flashing lights along the coast. I informed him that we had not.

At approximately 2203, Lt. Boos called again and requested that we put out a contact to see if we could spot any light along the coast. Capt. Weirol of same and had A/2C Tyson go outside on two of operations with a pair of field glasses.

Almost immediately after A/2C Tyson went outside, he reported that he had spotted a flashing, yellow light. I went outside to look at the yellow lights. I then informed Lt. Boos that A/2C Tyson had spotted some lights that we take pictures of object, obtain direction from station, estimate miles from station and have our Commanding Officer make out a report of same.

After Capt. Weirol arrived at operations he immediately went on the tower and looked at the object through field glasses. He then took four (4) pictures of the flashing light and was obtained a telescopic camera DF and took a bearing on the light. We found it to be 246 degrees from our radar tower. We also called the Japanese Coast Guard to have them check the area of the flashing light.

After observing the light for a short time, I estimated that the light was approximately fifteen (15) miles from our station. The light was flashing at approximately 1 second intervals for three flashes and then it stopped for approximately 3 seconds and then started same procedure again. I also observed that the light was stationary.

At approximately 2357, we received a report from the Japanese Coast Guard saying that there was a Japanese coal freighter in the area that we had them check. The name of this vessel was Towa Maru. I informed the Controller at Mitigta of same.

I was Sgt. of the Guard on 23 Feb. 1953, at approximately 2110 hrs. I was called to get a relief man for operations. After taking the relief man up to operations, I was on the catwalk of the radar station at the west end and, coming from the ocean, it was blinking at regular intervals of approximately one (1) second east for about (3) miles then disappeared. The distance was very hard to judge but I could get to the north tower (20, 210 feet). I came down off the tower on the line of sight distance.

NARRATIVE:

On approximately 1730, 25 Feb 53, 1/Lt T. Davis, ops chief on duty at Goose AFB, called me concerning a visual sighting of an unusual light of more and more brightness. The incident was detailed at 1630 visual observation of our off more area. That same evening, I went to operations at 2200 and observed the light which flickered large when at one seems intermittent and then remained out for some time. While discussing the incident with 1/Lt Davis, he stated that when - left the roof of the previous building, he observed through binoculars that an object sitting time when viewed with the naked eye possibly was a balloon. I estimated the distance from this station between 15 and 20 miles.

However, may be extended by binoculars the 5a mile area that was mass could be obtained. Sighting was made on the light, the bearing of light was approximately 340 degrees magnetic. Illuminated area was very close to a local. The weather was ideal for long distance sighting with no sky coverage, wind calm and the moon illuminating the surrounding area so that a human being could be distinguished at 100 to 200 yards. I attempted to take four photographs of the light but due to its brief duration believe they will be unsatisfactory. The underscored file is enclosed as inclosure 2. Five 1/Lt Davis in the foreground were used as reference lights and I am sure their intensity was such as to obliterate the pinpoint of light that was the object. From the direction and estimated range of the flashing light it would possibly be a ship navigation light indicated on Aircraft Navigation Charts of this area.

(Reference also TR 1-53, 511th ACW Group; TR 1-53, 327th ACW Group; and TR 2-53, TR 3-53 from 326th ACW Group).

Although this report involves an object sighting on 26 Feb 53 (See "Rig reference"), it has been submitted as a "personnel medical" report rather than as a FLYGRPT. This was accomplished in this manner because the reporting personnel determined the object sighted to be other than an "identified flying object", as stipulated in AFR 200-2.

This headquarters has received a later message from the reporting agency which stated that further investigation determined the object sighted to have been a lighthouse.

1. Description of Object: Object was a bright green light that resembled a star except for its size, brilliance, and apparent movement. The object was described as being several times brighter, larger, and much nearer to the earth than a normal star. The observers reported that an occasional time of red could be detected in the object. Throughout the period of observation, the object appeared to vary in intensity in a rhythmic pulsing manner, but did not appear to twinkle as a star does. Although no exhaust trails, seams or propulsion, or aerodynamic features were observed, the object seemed to move perceptibly to the right and toward from the position of original sighting. The object was observed to move approximately 010° in each successive viewing the object moved in a slow stair-like pattern. It was observed to move definitely to the right and very slightly upward, pause momentarily, and then move definitely toward and slightly to the right and pause before repeating this process. The object also appeared to recede at times as though it were either growing very dim or moving farther away at times. Observers were unable to estimate the size or shape of the object.

2. Time of Sighting: At 1900I for approximately 90 minutes.

3. Method of Observation: Visual without optical aids from the ground at LIOL.

4. Location of Observation: Throughout the period of sighting, the observers reported the object was initially seen at LGL 2240. At time of initial observation, the object appeared to be approximately 015° above the horizon at an estimated range of 7 to 10 miles at a bearing of approximately 045°. As the object moved, the observers judged its position at approximately 50 to 100 yards at an estimated range of 300 yards. The antenna poles are oriented in a general north-west to southeast direction approximately 100 yards apart and are set on a slight ridge. It is 10 feet more than the observers. Object was first sighted slightly to the right and slightly above the left hand pole. It subsequently moved to a position slightly to the right of the right hand pole approximately 025° from the first observation at an estimated 10,000 feet; at time of last observation approximately 20,000 feet.

5. Identifying Information on Observers: Observers were a 20 year old Airman and a 40 year old female USAF Information and Education Instructor. The Airman has had some aerial experience as a radio operator and exhibited good presence of mind in maintaining to altitude of object. Both appear sincere and are firmly convinced that their sighting was not a star.

6. Boundary: 7/10 Alto cumulus clouds at 12,000 feet. The moon was extremely bright and visibility was good.

7. Other Activity: When sighting occurred, the visibility was clear. Many persons in this area have reported observing somewhat similar phenomena and have expressed a belief that the objects seen were extraterrestrial. While some have appeared to vary in intensity and change colors, it is possible that the individuals concerned were deceived by the object's brilliance in estimating range and size. It is interesting to note that the majority of these sightings have occurred on nights when the moon was particularly bright.

STATEMENT

At approximately 1950I on the night of February 27, 1953 I observed an object, which at first might I took to be a star of exceptional brilliance. I noted the fact to myself, and then turned my attention to tuning the radio. Inside the automobile. About five minutes later, I glanced back at what I thought was the star, and it seemed to have moved both slightly to the right, and up. I thought then that I might have been mistaken in my first observation, so I looked away again. Then a short time later, I looked back and I was certain that it had moved. I then thought of the possibility of its being some sort of aircraft, but I knew that an aircraft would go out of sight in less than the time I had spent looking at this object. Then I took note of the changing brightness of the light, and its exceptional brilliance of it. I then started to think of how to estimate the altitude and distance both in miles from the same point, and in degrees from the same point. I used the clouds which I knew to be at about 20,000 feet, to estimate the altitude, and the base antenna which I knew to be directly off the end of the runway to estimate the distance in degrees. From my calculations, I would say that it was approximately 7 to 10 miles from the base, out over the sea.

I watched the object from 1950I until 2125I, and during this time it seemed to move both vertically and horizontally. I would say that it moved about 10° in both directions.

After watching for quite a while the object seemed to recede, then it came back at about the same position as it was when it started to recede. The following morning I started making questions about what the weather had been, and I called AICO to ask. I then had been only sighting of strange lights, other objects, there had been some. I then asked the man who had been on duty in the control tower if they had any knowledge of my sighting in the area, they said that all they knew of was some F-94's that had been out. I got these aircraft, and recognized them. These proceedings I reported to M/Sgt./News of my Squadron.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2000I on 27 February 1953 I was in a car outside Misawa city when I sighted what appeared to be a star out after observing it for some time it appeared 100 large and too close to the earth to be a star. Two Japanese SAA poles were raised, so the forward object was checked. The object was a little below the red light and to the right of the left hand pole. The object was described between the pole and then gradually moved up to the top of the right hand pole. I was over an area of a small track of clouds, then gradually it moved up and away until it was out of sight after having been observed over an hour. It appeared to be a dull green with an occasional ring of red, round in my shape could be described.

I in crew chief at GCI operations APO 73. My crew was on duty from 1300
to 2400, 26 February 1953, when Captain G.W. Miller, the senior controller
told me there was a strange object reported in the sky. At about 2230, I told
S/Sgt. Percy Watson and M/Sgt Sullivan to go outside and try to observe this.
I went out with them. We saw a reddish-orange object, azimuth about 275 degrees,
elevation about 20 degrees. The size of this object was that of a very large
star. It appeared to me to be an actual object closer than a star. I watched
it at least 2 minutes. It did not move. Then I returned to the operations
building. At about 2242 3/Sgt. Watson called me and I went outside again.
I saw the light fade and reappear, and finally fade completely such as an air-
craft light fades away in an aircraft travel out of sight. I would say the
object was almost on the horizon when it disappeared for good. Its azimuth
was unchanged from the time I first saw it.

STATEMENT

At about 2230 hours 26 February 1953, S/Sgt. William Standridge told us that other ACGW Sites had reported seeing strange lights in the sky and asked us to go outside the operations building and observe what we could.

We went out the west door of the operations building and climbed on top of a 10 foot embankment. In west (azimuth 205 degrees) elevation approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, we saw a round reddish-orange object. It was not too much larger than a star but large enough to show a definite round shape. Its diameter was probably 3 or 4 times that of a bright star. Our attention was attracted to this object by its color and motion. It moved from 20 degrees elevation to 5 degrees elevation in a minute or two. It moved back up to approximately 30 degrees elevation and stayed for a minute or two. Then it dropped to about 10 degrees elevation and stayed there.

For at least five (5) minutes, then one object appeared to move toward it. We viewed it as it moved toward the horizon. When the object disappeared the last time it was 2245 hours.

NARRATIVE:

On 26 February 1953 at approximately 2110Item hours an unusual object was sighted west of 3M Ground Radar Site #20 (Haina), Honshu, Japan, which is located at approximately 37 degrees 24 minutes N, - 138 degrees 36 minutes E.

The object is reported to have been stationary, in the form of an orange colored ball of unknown size, also red or light of unknown size and shape. The object was estimated to have been from 15 to 40 miles in diameter at a position bearing of 270 degrees magnetic, and at an altitude estimated to have been from 500 to 250 feet and 1500 to 3000 feet by several observers. The object was seen from approximately 2110K until approximately 2225K, for three (3) minutes.

At 2300K, another light was seen at a bearing which approximated that of the orange colored ball. However, the altitude was reported to have been close to the surface of the earth and moved slowly in a northerly direction. This light disappeared after about ten (10) minutes.

At approximately 2714K, three (3) unidentified blips were reported on the radar scope which were later identified as surface vessels.

At approximately 2324K, a red streak of light of unknown size and shape was seen to rise from the water to a height of approximately 200 feet, range estimated at 40 to 50 miles at 310 degrees, it then disappeared.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
Navy and Coast Guard contacted if they had any ships in the area with negative results. No aircraft were in the area. Weather was CALM, temperature 32 degrees. "Observations were visual without optical aids. Negative radar contacts on initial sighting. No photographs were taken.

This report submitted in accordance with Ltr. File 350.09 Subj: Reporting of Unusual Incidents, Hq. JADF, APO 710, dtd. 23 Oct. 52 as the preparing officer believes it was not a flying object.

STATEMENT

On 26 February 1953 at approximately 2110 hours, Majima Dog Fox called operations and reported a strange object at approximately fifteen (15) miles west of this station.

The crew chief, A/1C McClellan, went outside and took a look at it, came back inside, and reported it to our CI Station (Niigata). When he asked me to take a look at it and try to determine just what it might be, I went outside at approximately 2115 hours. At the west side of operations at approximately fifteen (15) miles, at about three (3) thousand feet up in the air was a strange object which looked like a fire ball. It appeared to be about ten (10) feet in diameter. While I was watching it, it changed color from green to red and then to red-orange. It maintained its original position for about three (3) minutes after changing colors, then it disappeared.

At approximately 2700 hours, I noticed a same light at approximately twenty miles North-West of this station. After watching this for a while, I went back to looking for the fire ball to appear again. Approximately ten (10) miles later, I went back to watching the same light. I had moved approximately 20 degrees from its original position. I reported the incident to Lt. Parker and went back into the operations building at approximately 2310 hours. I checked and called three (3) so called fire balls West of their station. I checked our weapon and noticed three ships at 274 degrees at fifteen (15) miles from this station, then I called them in to Niigata.
