(12) POSITION TITLE OF REPORTING OFFICER PD OIC OF FLIGHT SECT WOLTERS
AFB (AM EXT OF THE BASE OPS OFFICER HENSLEY AFB TEX) NO POSSIBLE CAUSE
OF THE SIGHTING IS A APPARENT PD IT HAS BEEN EXTABLISHED THAT NO
WEATHER BALLONS FROM THE WEATHER STA AT MINERAL WELLS MUNIC ARPT WERE
IN THE AIR AT THE TIME PD WINDS PD NORTH WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED THE
POSSIBILITY OF THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING IF THEY HAD
BEEN IN THE AREA CMA THE POSSIBILITY OF THE JET AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA
