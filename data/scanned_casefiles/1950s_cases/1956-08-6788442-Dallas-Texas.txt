AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Follow up on UFO report submitted on 11 Aug 56 Msg 7456th ACWRON 09-033
AREA REPORTING: Dallas, Texas
DATE OF REPORT: 14 August 1956 DATE OF INFORMATION: 11 August 1956
FROM (UNIT): 7456th ACWRON, Duncanville, Texas
SOURCE: Civilian Personnel, Love Tower and 7456th ACWRON

REFERENCES: (CITE PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE)

SUMMARY: [First paragraph appears to be partially obscured]

First report of UFOB was received by 1st Lt. William Boehnchouse, Director on duty at the time, from a 22 year old SMU College Student, who reported an unknown object over the White Rock Lake area. The object was first sighted at about 0420, 0430 last night, 11 Aug 56. Reported size of the planet Mars. This report was not investigated due to the unavailability of the reporting source. No further details known.

Msg was sent to your Headquarters on this incident.

At approximately the same time, an unknown object called the GOC filter center in Dallas and reported sighting a unknown object over the North Dallas area. At this time, two and a half miles west of town, some have been officially reported others were not. The lack of coordination information. The object sighted was by an Air Force communications specialist.

At approximate the same time (0420, 7456th ACWRON) sighted a unknown aircraft over their area. The information pertaining to this sighting is forwarded in Msg 7456th ACWRON. At the time of sighting the object was almost vertically overhead. Pilots and ground personnel observed the object. Approximately 35mm film was taken of this incident.

Love Field tower contacted them and reported that they had no aircraft under control or in their pattern at that time. They had an unknown object, no names were received by this section to further investigate the report. Love Tower reported that they had seen the object, but they had seen it.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in brief one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Begin on AF Form 118-Part II)

Duty at the time, from 8 M. to 22 M. was received by 1st Lt William Spellman, Director on duty at the time, from a Mr. [redacted], who is a 22 year old, SMU College Student, who reported an unknown object over the White Rock lake area. The object was sighted at about C4002, object disappeared without sound. Reported to be about twice the size of the planet Mars. This report was not investigated due to the inability of the report. However, the incident was passed to the Control Tech at Diploma. No Msg was sent to 7th Endorse.

At approximately C6052, a civilian, name unknown, called the GOC filter center in Dallas and reported sighting a UFO unknown object. Over the North Dallas area, at this time I would like to bear out that during the past two and a half months there have been numerous reports from that section of town, some have been officially reported others have not, due to the lack of certain information. The object sighted by Miss [redacted] at exactly 06202.

As approximately the same time of the day, "Utah", 745th ACWRON sighted an unknown aircraft or object on their radar scope. The information pertaining to this sighting is forwarded in ADD Form 123. At the same time the sighting the radar scope camera was turned on an about 100 frames of 35mm film were taken of this unusual track. Film is enclosed. Track that was sighted by this station is in the same vicinity that the civilian personnel reported seeing their unknown object.

Love tower reports that they had no aircraft under control or in their traffic pattern at that time. However, this several people called that and reported that they had seen an unknown object, no names were received for further investigation of the report. Love tower reported that there was a possibility that it was a meteor that they had seen, but that it was doubtful.

Reur IR-112, UFO report, dtd 14 Aug 56, submitting 35 MM Radar Camera film.

Your film submitted without any reference or notation in the report, package or film container that it was undeveloped film. Consequently, in route through many mail and screening units for check and logging, container opened. If possible, request copy or prints be submitted in accordance with par 8, AFR 200-2, AFR 95-6, and AFR 95-7. IR considered good report, but examination of film by ATIC specialists will permit better evaluation towards some firm conclusion.

There are also small white specks or dots scattered across the dark background, which might represent stars or noise in the image.

RADAR OBSERVATION WORKSHEET

I. QUESTIONS REGARDING DETECTING RADAR EQUIPMENT

1. What type radar equipment is involved?
CPS-63

2. Has there been any recent maintenance difficulties? If so, describe.
None

3. What type modulator (i.e., spark gap, hard tubes, etc.) is used in the radar equipment?
Thyratron

Yes

5. Has interference from another radar set been observed recently, and are personnel familiar with the effects caused by an interfering signal?
No     Yes

6. What type indicators, "A scope", "B scope", etc., were used to follow the target?
PPI

7. What was the radar scan rate?
4 RPM

8. What was the approximate frequency of the transmitter?
3,000 MC

II. GENERAL QUESTIONS

1. What were the general weather conditions at the time unidentified target was observed?
Vis 15, Clear

2. What weather data from nearby U.S. weather stations is available on temperature vs altitude, humidity vs altitude, and wind velocity vs altitude?
Unknown     Temp 80°     Humidity 30%     5 Knots SW

3. Was the target observed by any other nearby radar equipments? If so, give details.
No

4. Are the operator and the supervisor familiar with the effects of anomalous (duct-effect) propagation as they pertain to this type radar?
Yes

- page 24 -

(USE REVERSE SIDE OF SHEET IF MORE SPACE IS REQUIRED)

5. Has anomalous propagation been observed to extend the range of ground clutter by this radar at this site, and did this condition exist during or near the time that unknown target was observed?
No

6. What effects of rain storms and lightning have been observed on this radar?
None

7. Were any checks made to determine if unknown target could have been one of our own aircraft?
Yes

8. Was any interception attempted? If so, give details.
No, but Horse 38, Baker-36 was asked to investigate, target disappeared before aircraft could get to spot where target appeared.

9. Was a visual and/or Auditory observation made simultaneously with scope observation? If so, give detailed description. Yes, reference our Msg 03-093, 11/13/52 to your Hq and also 08-094.

III. SPECIFIC TARGET QUESTIONS

1. Did any technical personnel observe the unknown target on the Radar Scope? Have they been questioned thoroughly? What was their opinion?
No

2. Was a permanent record "track" made of the target positions as they appeared on the indicators? If so, attach to this report. (Plot on back of page 1.)
No

3. At what range, azimuth, altitude, and time was the target observed?
0450 at 45 or 50 mi., no altitude recorded

4. How did the target appear in size and shape as compared with conventional aircraft target?
The blip on the radar scope was at least three times larger than normal radar echo, from average aircraft.

5. Was the target of consistent size, or did it change rapidly?
Yes

6. Was the speed of the target constant or variable? Explain.
Speed of aircraft was constant at about 400 knots and seemed to orbit over the love field area.

7. Did the target appear "fuzzy" or clear and sharp as compared with a known aircraft target?
Target was definitely clear

8. What other (aircraft) targets were observed in the same general area, altitude, and time as that of the unknown target?
City aircraft in area that blip was normal 38, B-36 about 25 miles from area of unknown object.
