AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM 4708th Flying Ground Command
Eglin Air Force Base, Florida

REPORT NO.

PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

(1) Description of the Object:
(a) An elliptical egg shape
(b) Object at first appeared size of a drag parachute from a B-47 when viewed at a distance of one half a mile. When the B-47 and object separated, its size was variable to be estimated as 15 feet when reckoned that the object was at a great distance from the B-47.
(c) Dull grab aluminum color with little reflectivity.
(d) One.
(e) N/A
(f) Negative.
(g) None.
(h) None.
(i) There were not any markings or straight plane surfaces. The observers would have thought the object to be a weather balloon if it had not subsequently moved.

(2) (a) The observers were returning to Eglin Air Force Base during the lunch hour and noticed a B-47 coming in for a landing on the downwind leg. They then noticed an object at the same altitude as elevation of the B-47 and their first reaction was that it was a drag parachute. Then the aircraft continued its approach and the observers realized that the object was at a much greater distance than the B-47 (which was about one half a mile from the observers). They stopped their car out of curiosity and then believed the object to be a weather balloon. At first rather slowly, and then it began to accelerate, with a greatly increased rate. When the object moved on to less than 2 or 3, 45 degrees elevation, about 120 degrees azimuth, 50 degrees elevation, about 50 degrees azimuth.

(c) When the object accelerated, it resembled a pull up of a supersonic aircraft from level flight. The maneuver was similar to arc of a circle and the object appeared to speed a portion of an arc, 2 or 3. An analogous description of the flight maneuver would be the path of an arc of a sweeping search.

(d) The object moved out of sight of the observers.
(e) 15 seconds of which the object's maneuver lasted about three seconds.

(3) (a) Ground-visual
(b) N/A
(c) N/A

(4) (a) 1800Z 15 April 1957.
(b) Day.

(7) (a) Clear sky and unlimited visibility.
    (b) The following weather report was obtained from Detachment #10, 4th Weather
        Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The readings were taken at 1500Z
        April 1957:
        Surface - Wind from 030 degrees at 5 knots
        6,000 feet - 320 degrees at 13 knots
        10,000 feet - 310 degrees at 28 knots
        16,000 feet - 310 degrees at 36 knots
        20,000 feet - 290 degrees at 34 knots
        30,000 feet - 290 degrees at 47 knots
        50,000 feet - 290 degrees at 56 knots
        80,000 feet - 290 degrees at 13 knots

(c) Ceiling - unlimited
(d) Visibility - 10 miles plus
(e) Zone - None
(f) None.
(g) None.

(10) There were numerous aircraft in the air at the time of the sighting. However,
     in the line of sight from the observers to the object, the B-47 was the only
     aircraft present and it subsequently landed.

(11) The two observers appeared to be mature, sincere and reliable individuals.
     They have spent many years in the vicinity of Air Force bases and are accustomed
     to the various activities of the Air Proving Ground Command. The preceding
     officer, however, can not offer any explanation for the sighting and, since the
     time involved (15 seconds) was quite brief, it is believed that the
     unidentified flying object is not of any particular significance.
