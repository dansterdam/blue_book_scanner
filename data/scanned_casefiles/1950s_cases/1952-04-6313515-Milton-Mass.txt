AIR INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SUBJECT: (Unclassified) Reporting of Information
on Unidentified Aerial Objects (Near Theta
Hill, Milton, Massachusetts, 24 April 1952)

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D. C.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED
DOD DIR 5200.10

DETAILS:

On 28 April 1952, [partially redacted] civilian employees assigned to the Wave Systems Laboratory, Electronics Research Division, F Cambridge Research Center, 250 Albany Street, Cambridge, Mass., reported to Captain James R. Lake, Air Provost Marshal, that while observing the sky between 1120 and 1145 hours, they had observed two unidentified objects moving at high speed.

On 28 April 1952, [partially redacted] civilian employees assigned to the Wave Systems Laboratory, Electronics Research Division, F Cambridge Research Center, 250 Albany Street, Cambridge, Mass., reported to Captain James R. Lake, Air Provost Marshal, that they had observed unidentified flying objects between 1120 and 1145 hours, 28 April 1952.

On 29 April 1952, [partially redacted] was interviewed by special Agent [name redacted], and furnished the following information:

(1) Description of objects: Two (2) flat, circular, wing-like objects with greatest dimension approximately 100 feet, and of undetermined thickness, dark change or red in color, having no visible features, proceeding in trail.

[BODY]
wobbly, unambiling motion for about four (4) to six (6) miles in about 
one and onehalf (1½) minutes. The course was at first a rapid ascent 
from approximately a 1500 to a 2000 foot elevation, then on unsteadily 
horizontal plane for about four (4) to six (6) miles, and then another 
rapid at an undetermined angle. The object was light gray in color 
and did not make its three were two (2) objects until the first has 
nearly completed its initial ascent. No propulsion system noted.

(2) Objects were sighted at about 1430 hours in the after-
noon of 24 April 1952, and were observed for approximately one and one-
half to two minutes.

(3) Manner of observations: Visual observation followed by 
tracking through a "telescope, No. 4 (4") at shared with a battery 
Commander's telescope, which was mounted on a unit equipped with hand-
wheels and other controls.

(4) The path was sighted on the top of the that observation 
platform at the summit of the Great Blue Hill, Milton, Mass. It properly 
deviation showed approximately 765 feet. Object first appeared in a north-
west direction from the observer at a distance of about two (2) miles and 
was rising rapidly in a wobbly manner from altitude of approximately 1500 
to 2000 feet. After rising for about 100 feet, another object, identical in 
appearance with the first, was noticed. Both rose at few feet further in an 
unsteady direction for even four (4) to six (6) miles. Its speed estimated 
at 150 miles per hour. The objects then started to rise again at an angle 
and were not observed at time of disappearance.

(5) Identifying information on observers: [REDACTED] is an 
electronics scientist, assigned to the radar systems laboratory. [REDACTED] 
research division, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Has over a period of about 
one and one-half years has been regularly engaged in tracking separate by 
using a battery Commander's telescope and/or radar devices.

[REMAINDER OF PARAGRAPH IS PARTIALLY REDACTED]

When the objects were sighted, and that all three attempted, with negative 
results, to identify it as a bird, the observer states, he was defi- 
nitely that the objects were not kites, birds, large pieces of paper, or re- 
sembled in any detail aircraft known to him. He stated that the radar system 
at the tower was inoperative at the time of the sighting. He also stated 
that his description of the object was not influenced by any material which 
he has read on the subject of unknown objects, and that he reported the mat- 
ter to the Air Provost Marshal for immediate action within the said mile.

b. On 20 April 1952, [redacted] was interviewed by Special Agent J. S. G. Wilson, and furnished the following information:

(1) Description of Objects: The objects were white, from ten (10) to fifteen (15) feet across at their widest point. The two objects were circular and were a light whitish orange color. No exhaust were visible, and they looked 11"o "ovoid pulled in at the middle. Objects consistently maintained a visible, smooth motion. First in a "V" formation course, then alone, horizontal at times, and then, a second, but smaller, rise of about fifteen (15) degrees at an angle of 45 degrees. No twists or turns, no sound heard. Objects at about 2000 feet elevation when first observed, and at maximum height when last seen. Objects were smaller and softer traveling, may have been balloons and became invisible.

(2) Objects were sighted at about 1500 hours on the afternoon of 24 April 1952, and were covered over one-half visually (1/2) to a two (2) minute duration.

(3) Source of observation: by use of Kelley Aerographer's p. G. 1627.

(h) Observer was standing on top of tower at the tract site, Hill, Milton, Mass. Reference is made to paragraph (1) of this report.

(5) Identifying information on observer [mostly redacted]... 1951 has been regular, tracking aircraft at the Navy Research Laboratory and place July and/or Friday updates. [redacted] was in the company of [redacted] and tracked. [redacted] is well acquainted with civilian and military aircraft at the United States and cannot identify the objects seen with any accuracy. He was not in a position to make a definitive statement of the objects could cause their conclusion. [redacted] was not positive that the objects were not birds, there pieces of paper, kites, nor did they resemble any object known to him.

UNCLASSIFIED

Agent J. G. G. Hillery, and furnished the following information:

(1) Description of objects: Two (2) objects having definite "diamond to oval shape and flat surface. Objects appeared more distant shaped when rising, and more oval shaped after changing their direction to travel on an azimuth. Color was pale or gray. Calls. Size, estimated at about 24 dimension twenty (20) feet and not more than three (3) feet thick. Objects continuously maintained like conventional portrayal of flying car-pet, unusual with this particular variation to such object in or near ground. Estimated speed 400 miles per hour. No trail or exhaust, no sound heard. When first seen elevation of about 1000 feet, and when disappearing in the distance, about 8,000 feet. Traversed an angle of about 45 to 25 degrees along horizontal path. No propulsion system was evident.

(2) Objects were sighted at about 14:15 hours in the afternoon and were observed for not more than two minutes.

(3) Manner of observation: Through binocular slow type telescope mounted on movable base.

(4) Observer was standing on top of tower on the First Blue Hill, Milton, Mass. Objects were first seen hovering side by side for about twenty (20) seconds, and then began rapid perpendicular rise side by side to 8,000 feet, objects moved on a course of 65 degrees, or 8 miles, and then went into another side to back 2000 feet. Just before observer lost objects, they stopped and motionless. Without propulsion. General movement: from north to south.

(5) Identifying information on observer: [PARTIALLY REDACTED] is a cooperative employee at GE Cambridge Research Center and a member at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., senior in Electrical Engineering. He has been employed at the GE Laboratory as an aircraft observer since 4 February 1952, and has used the battery Commander's and slow type telescope and radar equipment in directing aircraft. In his own words, a steady, calm, objective observer of aircraft silhouettes. [REDACTED] was in the company of [REDACTED], fellow employee, when the objects were sighted and tracked.

(6) Weather clear, visibility estimated at 70 miles in covenant where objects were sighted. Sun hidden behind high overcast in opposite quadrant of sky from that in which objects were sighted. Wind: Hill weather station reported wind from northeast at about (4) miles per hour at time of sighting.
