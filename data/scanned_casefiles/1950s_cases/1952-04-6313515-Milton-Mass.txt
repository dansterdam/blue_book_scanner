UNCLASSIFIED

On 24 April 1952, at about 12:50 hours, an object was sighted at about 1,200 feet in the air. The object was described as wobbling, translating motion for about four and one-half minutes. The course was at first a rapid ascent from above the horizon, then an unsteady, erratic movement, until it disappeared below the horizon. The object was estimated to be about four to six miles in size. There were two other similar objects seen by the observers at the same time, and they observed the objects through binoculars.

The observers tracked the object through a theodolite telescope, which was mounted in a fixed position to enable continuous observation. Visual observations followed by tracking through a precision telescope indicated the object was about 1,200 feet in the air and moving in an irregular, wobbling motion. The angular elevation varied from about 15 degrees to 20 degrees. The motion was at first rapid, then became erratic and unsteady, until the object disappeared below the horizon. The object was estimated to be 4 to 6 miles in size.
