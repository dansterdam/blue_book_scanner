1. The photograph mentioned in paragraph 1 of DD Form 95 has been examined
and the following conclusions reached:

    a. The double exposure effect has been caused by camera movement during
    exposure, which could mean that a time exposure was made.

    b. The light object could be a balloon or a full moon as was suggested;
    the fuzziness does not signify that object was moving, but was caused by camera
    movement.
