[Redacted Address]
Richmond 5, California

Dear Dr. [Redacted]:

The Air Force appreciates your prompt answer supplying the additional information requested on your sighting of 14 December 1958.

Your suggestion that what you saw was the Thor IRBM was given prompt consideration, but ruled out because the firing took place on 15 December 1958.

Contact was made with the various weather stations to determine the weather at the time of your sighting and balloon launching schedules. A radiosonde release from San Francisco International Airport at 1500 hours from Oakland International Airport. The prevailing winds on 14 December 1958, at the time of your sighting would have drifted a balloon released at this airport to a position corresponding to that of your UFO.

These balloons attain diameters of greater than 30 feet at altitude and have a relatively high albedo. This fact has been substantiated by your observation that the object was brighter than Venus, which has an apparent magnitude of +4, as a brightness. These balloons are also equipped with radar reflectors which could possibly account for the smaller objects.

Approximating the distance, from the balloon track and time of flight, as seven miles, the balloon would subtend an angle on the order of seven miles through your binoculars.

The balloon's velocity relative to your position was mostly radial, consequently the apparent motionlessness of this object.

Your original data sheets are enclosed per your request.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

Attached herewith is report on an unidentified object seen by me Sunday afternoon, December 14, 1958.

I hereby ask you for transmission to the proper agency, concerned with these matters.

In reporting I would appreciate an answer to satisfy my curiosity.
Naturally, I do not wish for any official information.

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

LOCATION: Near Cayuga, California, approximately 15 miles west of Livermore, California. Objects had appeared in sky with approximately 135° from observers location area.

DESCRIPTION:
[A hand-drawn circle with some annotations, including "7x35 Binoculars" and notes about the objects]

Three small satellite-like
From object resolved
a disc
This small more
yellowish with objects

(a). Date: Sunday, December 14, 1958, approximate Pacific Standard Time 16:30.

(b). While making single object with 7x35 index approximately Pacific Standard Time. Object, magnitude -3. Sun had not set. Definite also nearby. Possibly two such with three smaller objects above and a single object to south. One diameter as seen in the binocular field of view. I would judge the smaller objects were of order 5° magnitude.

(c). Objects apparently stationary in sky. Ascension and Declination. There was or was not been verified velocity but I was not taking notes of this kind.

CONFIRMED THIRD PARTY STATEMENT:

Oakland radio reported scattered this event at 26,000 ft on the 1645 PST frequency from aeronautical radio). Barometer 29.92; I would like to check through radio log for confirmation. Approximately 5 minutes to the first sighting. By the time I could see was a small point radio at 2 ft. Determined...

Heavier and obscured even this point source. By the time the over-next
had drifted across the area, which was approximately 10 minutes, I could
see no trace of anything in the location described. Visibility unquestionably
was good. Visiting meteorologist, hereinafter so well as in his flight
and in the tracking charts, was able to confirm this. The sun was still illuminated. Time of sunset, approximately 1653 per which could be made at
sunset. 1703 PST. There was no cloud cover. The moon was approximately
set. When we came First Quarter December 17, 1958.

Acquired. I am tracking the object on my aircraft instruments. I was
restricted for but did not use Mars which at best was in my direction. I
tested altitude and speed. When the same R. and D. cameras noted very
close to a single frame which I was able to use when plotting the picture.
Of the sun and the moon and sun close to the sun. Further was in front
near site to result Jupiter's disc which made binoculars almost useless.
The three small objects were much brighter than perhaps seen by my diagonal.
Bearing at the same time was approximately 125 magnetic. The lunar
altitude and approximately 320 and was south of the equator. Bearings
were measured with Brunell sextant at a later date. Bearings were measured
by a magnetic compass at a later date, hence can approximate, the
bearing. The object would place it over Oakland airport and the bearing
continued would slowly approximate that of San Jose from my location.

POSSIBLE IDENTITIES AND COMMENTS:

(a). Lunar probe losing a stage. This was my first impression but
no shots by my knowledge have been reported from Vandenberg.

(b). Satellites. No weight with small satellites balloons
raising some device. This is possible, but is disappeared while
is small. Large aircraft could be so illuminated by daylight,
and height. This is possible, however, an experienced
observer and not subject to hallucination would not likely
pilot and a Lockheed Surgeon. W. note confirmed the
sighting but was no no chance to the naked eye. Also there are no parallax to vision.

(c). Meteorite. This is not possible as the time interval to discuss
a supernova. This is not possible as the time interval to discuss.

(d). Meteor of the fire ball type. This is not likely. We
know the sun was low in the sky at this time. There was no
the object was observed.

(f). Flying Saucer. I was skeptic for discontinuous length due
on image and I am still skeptic for their existence.

(a). "Ghost" due to lens reflection in the binoculars. I am aware
of these being a possibility and have checked out.

(b). Other explanations. You told me from here. I may what I have
noticed. I do it as well at 1700 feet like it before. I checked the
signals and finding NNW at 10 me loud and clear and steady.

I certify that to the best of my ability I have represented the facts.
I must while expressing this as a staff man as the weather bureau may
be concerned with these such as this.

Yours truly,

UROLOGY
[REDACTED] - RICHMOND 5, CALIFORNIA - [REDACTED]

January 26, 1959

Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Attention: AFCIN-142A

Dear Sir:

Referring to attached letter, also please refer to Aviation Week issue December 22, 1958, page 24, which reached me after my letter dated December 23, 1959.

If the Thor firing from Vandenburg was on Sunday, December 14, 1958, and if it were delayed more than "scheduled at about noon but did not come off until about three and a half hours later", we can button this up.

If it were not the Thor firing, it was something else and I answer your queries:

1. Magnitude comparison made so follows: I have always had to search to find Venus in daylight at greatest brilliancy as this was for defining the magnitude.

2. I thought at first it was reflected light but after reading the Aviation Week report I note a reference to a "white hot exhaust".

3. Color was that of Venus, streak more yellowish. At present time (6 weeks after) I would guess streak color about that of Arcturus. No pulsations, no shock diamonds, no flickering. There was a steady fade, however, but also a steady increase in high thin overcast as I stated.

4. Unable estimate angle subtended--too small and too unsteady through binoculars. If necessary I can amend this statement by setting up a transit and getting an idea using the radome on Tamalpais, and interpolating into the binocular field. Let me know if you wish me to do this.

FURTHER COMMENTS:

If I accept the Aviation Week statement then how do I reconcile the Thor firing stated azimuth of 251 degrees? Take my estimate of 135 magnetic, add variation and give me 20 degrees of error and I yet an answer of less than 100% true from Berkeley half a mile west from Claremont Hotel.

This sighting I made was definitely east of my meridian. I must assume that you have distorted the Thor firing azimuth prior to publication.

Aviation Week mentions two territories. I must have seen three small objects or I wouldn't have described three. I attach my original data sheets which here, of course, paraphrased for style and grammar to make my report.

If you can, without violating security, let me know if both I and my wife doped off together. We are both pilots and had neither been drinking or in any way not in full command of our senses and naturally we're curious.

Please return my original data pages after you are finished with them. Thanks.

Yours truly,
