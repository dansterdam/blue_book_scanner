4 October 1955
Afghanistan

On October 4, Kabul, Afghanistan reported that the Soviets were testing a revolutionary bottle-shaped aircraft at a secret base in the remote and mountainous regions just north of Afghanistan. More than 1000 residents of the Afghan corridor reported seeing the strange craft which they first said looks something like a flying saucer. Witnesses reported it was shaped something like a neckless bottle, about 20 feet high, with "pins" extending down from the bottom edge, apparently similar to the new U.S. flying Platform. Flames appeared to shoot out of the top and bottom of the craft.

There was a big wind which officials took to be the downward thrust of air at high speed. "The craft had a blue band around the middle," the witnesses said.

THE MYSTERY AT MEDICINE BOW PEAK

Although occasional mishaps are frequent and some times mysterious, we cannot blame them all on the UFO. While more are due to operational causes, others forever look suspicious in spite of their rational explanation.

During the past few months we have seen a little curious about the increasing number of military plane colliding, a matter which is the perennial blanket of secrecy. Is really hiding the true circumstances? Clearly the answer is even greater doubt as to the cause such as the incidents occurring at Denver, Colo., and elsewhere, affecting the three of 66 people. For analysis of the case, here is Herbert E. Clark, Jr. who is well-informed in the field of aviation.

Offers Theory In
Oct. 6 Air Crash

DENVER, Nov. 15 (JP) — A company official, today said that the crew of the United Air Lines DC-4 that crashed Oct. 6 killing 66 persons might have been "incapacitated". Just before the accident, Warren D. Williams, U. A. flight operations manager, told the Civil Aeronautics Board hearing he could not offer any other explanation.

In his second day of testimony, L. R. Somermeyer of flying, said Capt. A. L. Gieseke, chief of the U. A. L. flying operations, talked to Capt. Cooke over the Medicine Bow Range in Wyoming via "telephone" communication.

THE MYSTERY AT MEDICINE BOW PEAK

Although 'aviational mishaps are frequent and sometimes notorious, we cannot blame them all on the UFO. While most are due to operational causes, others forever look suspicious in spite of their written-off explanations which evades certain evidence.' For example, moments we have grown a little curious about the increasing number of military planes colliding in midair and the number of the powerful blanket of security is really hiding the truth.

However, leaving no doubt as to the cause such as the incident even greater Medicine Bow Peak, Wyoming, a disaster affecting the lives of 66 people. For analysis of the evidence, known to date, we return to Herbert E. Clark, Jr. who is well-informed in the field.

To Case 108, Medicine Bow Peak, Wyo. Oct. 6, 1955 - To begin, Clark does not necessarily blame the disaster on a UFO, but merely point out some of the unexplained mysteries and flaws in the announced circumstances surrounding the affair. We quote from Clark as appearing in DC-4, flying 200 mph - I tracked 30 minutes after take-off from Denver. Reports indicate the location has been given as 35 miles off course but no information has been given relative to which course the craft was flying. The weather report over the area showed the plane was flying at 11,800 ft. and thus all however, the plane was flying at 12,005 ft. high. The pilots certainly had knowledge of this terrain. The plane was operating normally, but there equipment which presumably was in operation, but there was no record of any radio signals.

The plane was also equipped with OMNI, a radio direction finding aid. In such a case, the pilot would reply by radio. When such stations reply, which is known exactly the position of his plane.

There are three airports that the DC-4 could have landed: Laramie and Medicine Bow. None of these towns reported the plane.

Logically, Clark continues: "Where, why and how could the plane get off course? How could all of the instruments fail? There are only three conclusions for the group of data available: (1) Instrumentation and radio was therefore out of order. (2) If artificial magnetic influences, (3) the plane could have compiled with or came in contact with the magnetic field of an UFO." (Ed: See Case 24)

Space Experts Predict Men Will Land on Moon by 2000

COPENHAGEN, Aug. 3 (JP)—American scientists predicted today unmanned space ships will land on the moon by the end of this century.

At the same time prediction that unmanned space ships will be on the moon "within twenty years" was made by American space experts at the International Astronautical Congress here today.

Mr. Peterson, president of the North American Rockwell Corp., told the morning session of the space congress that the world not expect a landing on the moon before the year 2,000. But he said there is no reason why it could not be done.

Mr. Peterson, speaking to newsmen, was emphatic that unmanned space ships will reach the moon within twenty years.

Dr. Fred A. Hitchcock, of the Ohio State University Laboratories, said that while there are medical obstacles to sustained space flight, the Sixth International Congress on Space Medicine heard today that it is absolutely necessary to shield its personnel from excessive amounts of ultra-violet radiation and cosmic rays outside the earth's atmosphere. "In the view of the fact," Dr. Hitchcock said, "that most space class and plastics now used in space suits and space cabin equipment can easily be accomplished."

Cosmic Rays

"The matter of shielding from cosmic rays is much more difficult," he said. "Experiments are currently under way to determine the effects of cosmic radiation. These experiments will consist of exposing small animals to regions in the upper atmosphere where cosmic radiation at a maximum can be studied."

Space Ship Design

Dr. Hitchcock said scientists still have to solve the problem of designing a space ship that will withstand the lack of oxygen masks, that will withstand the tremendous heat and cold of outer atmosphere and will provide an artificial atmosphere in the vacuum of gravity-free space.

NEW YORK HERALD-TRIBUNE, THURSD.

To Test Sodium in Ionosphere

'Full Moon' Rocket Explosion in Octol
By James E. Warner
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 — The
United States Air Force hopes
to explode a sodium-vapor rocket
sixty miles above the earth's
surface this autumn, rivaling
the brightness of the full moon-
light, the Air Force announced
today.

The projectile will be launched
from Holloman Air Force Base,
New Mexico, sometime between
Oct. 14. It will be an aerobee
rocket, 50 feet long, capable
of reaching an altitude of about
250 miles.

Purpose of this experiment is,
first, to find if there is a layer
of sodium in the ionosphere, the
upper atmosphere, and second,
to find how thick it is.

The sodium vapor will be ejected from the rocket after it reaches its peak altitude, be-released suddenly, and scientists
will observe the cloud.

In the absence of a natural sodium layer in the sky.

The experiment also may provide data, according to Dr. James A. Van Allen, Research Laboratory, for the satellite's which the United
States hopes to launch in 1957. The satellite, rocket-propelled, will rise above the earth's surface at an altitude of between 200
and 300 miles.

A somewhat similar project was tried last winter, with no success, by the Naval Research and Development Center at Point
Mugu, Calif. The project was "scooped" by a British scientific
community at Belfast, Northern Ireland. On Thursday,
it was announced abroad before it was
released here. On Thursday,
the project was discussed at a
meeting in Brussels, Belgium.

Professor Bates, who will lead one of
the university groups researching the
program, said today there are distinct cultures in releasing sodium vapor.
Boiling of the metal to release
the vapor has been suggested, he
declared.

The Americans may release sodium by exploding a rocket, which would vaporize the metal.

He considers that the experiment would provide information on the
extreme height, the temperature of
the atmosphere and the chemical
reactions going on.

The Royal Society, leading
British scientific body, has dis-
closed that Britain is entering
the field of exploring the earth's
upper atmosphere with sodium-
laden rockets. The British announcement added that a similar
program has been started in
Brussels.

U. N. Control of Moon Plans
Urged to Allay War Fears
A call for United Nations control of the launching of earth satellites, to allay fears that experiments might have some military applications, was made today by a leading scientist.

Mr. Eichelsberger pointed out that a precedent was set in the International Geophysical Year for the peaceful use of atomic energy and advanced a similar agency to supervise international scientific work.

In a communication to newsmen, Mr. Eichelsberger noted that President Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson had stressed the importance of the plan to send up a satellite within the next few years. He also mentioned other international cooperation.

With other nations.

Mr. Eichelsberger reminded that our greatest rivals, the Russians, announced their intention to set up a space satellite at the beginning of experiments leading to interplanetary flights.

He suggested that work could be done under United Nations supervision to prevent misunderstandings between the scientists and the dreamers of all countries. It would help allay the fears of both peoples and governments that what does not mask military projects capable of frightful destructive power is being developed.

Monument Study Bill
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 — Signed today by President Eisenhower, a bill authorizing an investigation to determine the advisability of erecting a national monument in Brooklyn in honor of 258 Maryland soldiers killed during the Revolutionary War.
