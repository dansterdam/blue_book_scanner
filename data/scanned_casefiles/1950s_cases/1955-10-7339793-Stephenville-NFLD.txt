The text in the document reads:

On October 4, Kabul, Afghanistan reported that the Soviets were considering a revolutionary battle-shaped aircraft at a secret base in the remote and mountainous regions north of Afghanistan. 

More than 1000 residents of the Afghan corridor reported seeing the strange center which they said looks something like a flying saucer. Witnesses reported it was sharp something like a neckless bottle, about 20 feet high, with "spines" extending from the bottom. The craft was hovering and Flattering.

There was a bi-wind which officials took to be the downward thrust of air at high speeds. "The craft had a blue band around the middle and"

THE FLYING SAUCERS AS MENACING ROW YEAR

Although aviational mishaps were frequent and even deaths occurred in the year 1955 in the United States and other countries, we do not consider these as ordinary aircraft accidents as the explanation given by the authorities is not convincing enough. In spite of their suspicions and explanations, the public is not satisfied with the answers provided by the officials. The happening of a number of such incidents has already led many people to entertain the view that there is something unusual about them and they may be connected with the appearance of mysterious flying objects - commonly called "flying saucers" or "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).

Text extracted from the image:

Offers Theory In Case Of Air Crash
DENVER, Nov. 22â€” A Denver attorney said today that if a flying saucer ever crashes near here, the government should immediately take possession of it in the name of the people.
James A. Williamson V., A.F. (Ret.) said in an interview that the finder of the crashed saucer would be entitled to a reward, but the government should take over the craft.
He said the government should set up a commission to study the saucer's construction and how it operates.
Williamson said if the saucer is found to be of extraterrestrial origin, it should be turned over to a United Nations scientific commission for further study.
He said that in the second day of sightings of a bright object over Stephenville, Nfld., the object was not the planet Venus, as reported, but an actual flying saucer.

Text from the document:

THE MYSTERY AT MEDICINE BOW PEAK

While the latest confirmed UFO sightings are frequent and come under investigation, the three mysterious sightings reported here defy complete explanation. While most of the UFO reports can be accounted for by conventional causes, others still remain a mystery. In this case, we cannot blame them all on the U.S.O.'s while these cases are due to operational causes, these curious findings did occur nonetheless.

The plane is described as a round, glowing object, silver gray in color, traveling at an extremely high rate of speed which evades certain sections of the sky in a zigzag manner. A little curious about the increase in reports today, causing a little concern among the populance and government officials. And while we cannot deny the facts as presented here, there is little reason to believe this particular instance is conclusiive. Other explanations such as the incident could have been merely a hoax or misidentification also seem plausible. For analysis, the available evidence, although limited, does not conclusively prove or disprove the existence, known to date, we return to Herbert E. Clark. Jr. who will be informed in the field 6 aviation.

Clark merely points out some of the unexplained features in the incident and the case remains unresolved at this time. There is a very interesting background surrounding the disaster as detailed reports indicate the plane was a routine military flight on a clear, moonlight night. The S.A.C. flying 200 miles away reports indicate the plane was on normal flying operation. However, the sightings of the UFO's occurred at about the same time and place. The crew members at the time were contradictory. The reports indicate a tremendous speed but the plane was making a normal landing upon arrival. 

The complete and impartial knowledge of this terrain, the plane had full radio communication, and nothing unusual was noted by the pilot or crew. The plane was also sighted by ground observers which sends signals to range stations. When such stations are notified, they can obtain fixes on the plane's position.

There are three reports that the DC-3 plane was seen by residents of the area - Larson, Laramie and Collins. Clark concludes "Where so much cannot be explained and the circumstances point to the possibility of an INCIDENT rather than a crash, it would be unwise to accept many of the hasty explanations that have been advanced. The plane may well have been influenced by some phenomena unknown to the present and only the further collection and study of evidence can shed light on the mystery."

"What was it?", the people ask, "Where did it come from?" The angels are still trying to decide if it was a "calling card", left from one of their visits. Chemistry Dept. at the Burlington, North Carolina Municipal Airport reported that tests showed a strange substance, resembling spider web, contained no harmful chemicals. "It appears to be made of silicon", said Dr. Carl R. Hart. "Apparently it fell from the sky. We have found no evidence of any conventional origin." The finding was reported to the U.S. Air Force on October 29, 1955.

And describing the incident: On the evening of 9/8/54, at approximately 7:50 P.M., I was doing some yardwork at my home in Stephenville, Newfoundland. As I was working, I noticed a bright light in the sky, moving in a southerly direction. It was a very clear night, and the light seemed to be quite a distance away. At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but it was moving much faster than any airplane I had ever seen. The light seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed, and it had no blinking lights or other identifying features of an aircraft. I continued to watch it for several minutes as it moved across the sky. It seemed to be gliding rather than powered flight, and it made no sound that I could hear. I've never seen anything like it before. After observing it for a few minutes, it simply disappeared from view. I have no idea what it was, but it certainly did not appear to be any type of conventional aircraft.

Space Experts Predict Men Will Land on Moon by 2000
COPENHAGEN, Aug. 3 (/P) - Space experts said today that medical obstacles to sustained absolutely necessary for men to travel to the moon and return safely have been overcome.
Dr. Hoyle, professor of astronomy at Cambridge University, told newsmen that rocket-propelled vehicles could land men on the moon by the year 2000 A.D.
"We have the technical know-how to do it," he said, "and the only real obstacle is the heavy cost."
Mr. Durant of Lexington, Mass., a space scientist, said that the next step appears to be a manned artificial satellite, which could serve as stepping stones to the moon.
"One way to travel yet, and one of the most obvious, is to put up a space platform, a space station, as a stepstone from which we can launch to the moon and return, with the greatest chance of success," he said.
Moon Plans For Air Force
The space experts expressed belief that the United States Air Force is working on plans for a possible moon landing. The Air Force declined to comment on the statement.
The Chilean peso has been allowed to fall. The slide in the value of the Chilean peso was by government design to make Chilean exports more competitive. The peso has been allowed to reach 5,000 per dollar, down from 3,100 on July 29.

To Test Sodium in Ionosphere 
'Full Moon' Rocket Explosion in Octol
By James E. Warner 
Washington, Oct. 6 (AP) - To explode a sodium vapor rocket 300 miles high in the atmosphere and study the reactions may lead to development of an artificial "moonlight," the Air Force announced today.
The test will be made in the absence of a natural moonlight and will be designed to study the effect of sodium vapor release in the upper atmosphere and to determine how much artificial "moonlight" could be produced.
The test rocket, which is part of a series of high-altitude experiments, is expected to reach an altitude of about 300 miles and release a cloud of sodium vapor, which will glow brightly and remain visible for some time, according to Air Force officials.
The test is scheduled for sometime in October, although no definite date has been set.
Similar tests in the past have shown that sodium vapor released at high altitudes will form a glowing cloud visible for hundreds of miles and that the sodium atoms can persist in the upper atmosphere for a considerable period.
The Americans may release enough sodium to produce a "full moon," the article states, but the exact amount needed to create artificial moonlight is not known. The test is part of a series of high-altitude experiments aimed at studying the ionosphere.
