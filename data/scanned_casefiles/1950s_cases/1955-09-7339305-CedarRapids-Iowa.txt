COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by an aircraft of the following reasons:
a. The time of the sighting coincides with the landing time of a Beechcraft A/C at the nearby airport. The A/C landed at 2023 hours and the A/C landed at the airport 6 miles south of the city accounting for the distance. The airport is located six miles south of the city accounting for the time difference when the object failed out of sight.
b. The bright color can be explained by the reflection of the city lights on the plane or the red light of the plane itself.
c. The lack of motion might have been caused by wind currents or a slight plane traveling at a low rate of speed as observed.
d. Such an A/C would not give off a sound considering the distance from which the object was observed.
e. The investigation revealed no balloon or astronomical activity that would account for the sighting.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by the Beechcraft Bonanza type aircraft mentioned in the report.
