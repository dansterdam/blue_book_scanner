AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Det. 2, 4602d AISS                   FLIGHT NO. D2-UFO2-1-55       Part Three       PAGE 4 OF 4 PAGES

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by an aircraft for the following reasons:

    a. The time of the sighting coincides with the landing time of a Beechcraft Bonanza type A/C in that the object was sighted at 0584552 and the A/C landed at 0854553. The airport in location at six miles south of the city accounting for the time difference of approximately five minutes from the time the object faded out of sight and the A/C landed.

    b. The bright orange color can be explained by the reflection of the city lights on the plane or the red light of the plane itself.

    c. The lack of motion might have been caused by wind currents or a light plane travelling at a low rate of speed head on towards the observer.

    d. Such an A/C would not give off a sound considering the distance from which the object was observed.

    e. The investigation revealed no balloon or astronomical activity that would account for the sighting.

                                                        HANS BISCHOFS

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by the Beechcraft Bonanza type aircraft mentioned in the report.
