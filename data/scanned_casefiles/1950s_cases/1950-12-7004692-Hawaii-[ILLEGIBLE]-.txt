At about 2232 hours at Hickam AF Base, 24 December 1950, he observed in the sky off shore from Hickam AF Base, a bright object, traveling at a high rate of speed from the direction of Barbers Point, Oahu, past Hickam AF Base, in the direction of Lanikai, Oahu, disappearing in low clouds covering the Koolau mountains. The forward section of this object appeared to be of the white bright-nose similar to that of increased 1 lights off, was circular in shape and traveling at a height of approximately 6000 feet; and from the point of view of observer was approximately 18 inches in diameter. Observer described that the object had an orange flame-type tail, about a long as the florescent section, this tail tapering to a point. An overall description given was "like that of a squid going through water." Observer stated that no

    deviation in course was noted that object maintained
    consistent altitude and speed, and traveled a course
    parallel to the ground. Observer states he kept object
    in sight for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. No noise
    was heard. Indicated he has 19 years service, and
    had not been drinking at time of sighting, as he was
    enroute to Christmas midnight church services.

c. The Honolulu Star Bulletin, a daily English language
    newspaper of general circulation throughout the Territory
    of Hawaii, in its Home Edition of 25 December 1950,
    carried the following news story on page 1:

    MYSTERY LIGHT FLASHES ACROSS SKY; CALLS FLOOD SWITCHBOARDS

    Many Honolulans Christmas Eve called the police,
    newspapers and radio stations to ask about a mysterious
    light seen briefly in the sky about 10:30 P. M.

    This morning, with no official confirmation of the
    phenomena, The Star-Bulletin was still receiving calls
    from persons who said they saw what has been described
    variously as a rocket, a meteor or possibly a low flying
    airplane.

    Mrs. [REDACTED], called the police
    department at 10:45 p.m. to report seeing a "streak of
    light flashing through the clouds from Diamond Head to
    Wilhelmina Rise."

    REPORTS THE SAME

    Others who telephoned the police were identified as
    Theodore Rhea of Aiea Heights and [REDACTED], of
    [REDACTED].

    Other callers to the police did not leave their names.

    Not all reported seeing the same light in the sky, at
    about the same time.

SUBJECT:    Unconventional Aircraft

Ref described the light as being brilliant orange in color and lasting for only four or five seconds.

The police called the coast guard after several reports on the light or falling star had been received. The coast guard didn't know what might have caused it.

[Name redacted], Jr., Honolulu's astronomical expert and a scientist for the Bishop museum, said this morning he had not seen the phenomenon and was unable to account for it from the descriptions given.

DEFINITE COURSE

A patron of the Drive In theater said the object was traveling at a great speed and was going from the Koko Head direction toward town.

"It seemed to be on a definite course," he said, "and was traveling parallel with the ground. It was a brilliant orange flame and the biggest part of it appeared about the size of a four engine plane."

[Name redacted], of Aiea, said: "I walked out to my garage about 10:30 when I saw a brilliant flame traveling from Koko Head direction and headed almost due north.

"It was traveling parallel with the ground and seemed to be on a course. I saw it only about 3 or 4 seconds before it disappeared into a cloud bank.

"My first thought was that it was a meteor, but it seemed to be traveling on a definite course. Then I thought it might have been a jet aircraft."

SPEED TRACKING

[Name redacted] Kailua, said the object was traveling from Diamond Head toward Koko Head at a terrific rate of speed.

"It was traveling parallel with the ground and was visible for about five seconds," Mr. [Name redacted] said. "There was no noise and I would judge it to be not over 5,000 feet in altitude.

"It was a brilliant orange color." Like the rest Mr. Richmond said he lost track of it when it disappeared into a cloud bank.

1. The following priority message, which concerns the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of a USAF plane, was forwarded by the Intelligence Officer, 1500th Air Transport Wing, MATS, Hickam AFB, Hawaii:

ATV Intelligence 8857, DTG 260012 Dec 50. Under the provisions of MATS Regulation 200-3, the following information pertaining to an unidentified flying object is hereby reported. This Rapid Report is in exact quotation from the report of the pilot, Captain [REDACTED], who was evacuating patients between Johnson AFB and Hickam AFB. "At the South Port Allen Intercession at 250832B was a large bright light approached our aircraft SB-17, 3768, from about three o'clock. We were cruising at 7,000 feet on a heading of 59° magnetic. The subject aircraft of some sort approached from the right and cut in front of us and climbed straight ahead of us out of sight. I couldn't distinguish any particular characteristics because the light was so bright. There was full moon and no clouds at the time. Then the thing had passed ahead we went through its 'prop wash'. It trailed an orange flame and sparse, noticeable only when it pulled away up from us. I would guess its speed to be over 300 LFH and it maneuvered like a fighter type aircraft. My first impression was that it was shining a bright floodlight at our aircraft, therefore we couldn't see too well its exact size and shape, which we could have otherwise seen in the bright moonlight. I did not change heading or altitude because it was about 1,000 feet above my flight path, or seemed to be. In my navigator's control and engineer's unbiased strange flying machine. I had plenty of time to call the navigator on interphone and asked him what he thought it was and he had time to look out and call me back. I flashed my landing lights but no response from the other ship. On checking navigational lights. This object had no resemblance to a falling star or meteor. I would judge its came within 200 yards of us before turning, another aircraft was on 2870 kc. Honolulu Overseas Radio called in and asked if there were other aircraft in the Honolulu South Port Allen area. I called at 250352 and gave my position as at South Port Allen at 7,000 feet. After landing I discovered other people had seen the same thing as I and had the identical description."

2. Confirmation of the sighting is indicated in the following message received from the Commander, Pacific Division, MATS, Hickam AFB, Hawaii:

FL 1216, DTG 260145Z Dec 50. Unidentified luminous white circular object visually obviously rotating, passing over John Rogers Airport, and disappearing into local clouds over the mountains east of Honolulu. The object followed a straight level course at a constant speed greater than that of a jet aircraft. The total time on the observed course was estimated at 45 to 46 seconds. The altitude was estimated at 8,000 feet. Diameter was proportionate to a one-foot object ten feet from the observer. An orange flame extended twice the diameter of object. The majority of the flight was observed with no visibility limitations, when the object entered local clouds over the mountains east of Honolulu, the clouds were illuminated. The above preliminary report was obtained from the observers who indicate that there are at least ten other witnesses. The Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, has received similar reports from other observers, one of whom believes the object was a meteorite. He bases his belief on previous observations of meteorites. An investigation is being conducted. A full report will be rendered as soon as possible.

SAUCERS or ILLUSIONS
By William A. Daye

Now the question of flying saucers has been a topic of much discussion and aspiring the minds of people who seek to find the truth of the matter. Since the first flying saucer was reported, many people have been puzzled and mystified by the strange objects seen in the sky.

Some say they are guided missiles, others claim they are from another planet, while some think they are just optical illusions. The Air Force has investigated many reports and has tried to explain them away as natural phenomena.

Shortly after the first reports came out, people began to speculate and theorize about the origin of these mysterious objects. Many theories have been advanced, but none have been conclusively proved.
