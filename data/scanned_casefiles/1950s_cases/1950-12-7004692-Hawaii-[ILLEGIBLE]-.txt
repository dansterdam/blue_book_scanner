through 7x50 binoculars. 
And here is another one: 
On Jan. 4, 1953, at about 8:00 P.M., a maintenance crew supervisor at an airport 
in Texas observed a bright light in the sky. He first thought it was an aircraft 
but it was moving at a very rapid rate of speed and appeared to change direction 
abruptly. It appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and about the size of a 
basketball held at arm's length. It did not appear to emit any sound. It was 
visible for about 1 minute. The observer is considered reliable.

The object was first observed about 5:30 PM HST, 25 September, 1950. The observation continued for about 8 to 10 minutes. The object appeared as a bright light in the sky, approximately 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon. The object moved in a northeasterly direction, then stopped and hovered in the sky for a period of time. It then accelerated and disappeared from view. No noise or trail was observed. The object was observed by two independent observers, both of whom were pilots of the U.S. Air Force.

carried the following news story on page 1:

MYSTERY LIGHT FLASHES ACROSS SKY; CALLS FLOOD SWITCHBOARDS

Many Honolulans Christmas Eve called the police, the
newspapers and radio stations to ask about a mysterious
light seen briefly in the sky about 10:30 P.M.

This morning, with no official confirmation of the
observers-collectors, use still receiving calls
from persons who said they saw what has been described
variously as a searchlight or possibly a low flying
airplane.

Dep't. officers called the police
department at 10:43 P.M. to report seeing the "streak of
light flashing through the clouds from Diamond Head to
Waialualua lines."

REPORTS THE SAME

Others who telephoned the police were identified as
residents of Aiea Heights and Kaimuki.

Other callers to the police did not leave their names.

But all reported seeing the same light in the sky, at
about the same time.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aircraft
26 December 1950

Most described the light as being a brilliant orange in color and rising at a great speed. The police called the coast guard after several reports on the lights or falling stars had been received. The coast guard didn't know what might have caused it.

A scientist from Honolulu's astronomical expert and a scientist for the Bishop museum, said this morning he had not seen the phenomenon and was unable to account for it from the descriptions given.

DEFINITE COURSE
A patron of the Drive In theater said the object was traveling at a great speed and was coming from the Koko Head direction toward town.

It was colored an orange color and was traveling parallel with the ground. It was a brilliant orange glow and the biggest part of its appeared to be the size of a four engine plane.

At 10:30 Miss said: "I walked out to my garage about 10:30 when I saw a brilliant flash traveling from Koko Head direction and headed almost due north."

It was traveling parallel with the ground and seemed to be on a course. It disappeared into a cloud bank in a about 3 or 4 seconds before it disappeared into a cloud bank.

"My first thought was that it was a meteor, but it seemed to be traveling on a definite course. Then I thought it might have been a test aircraft."

SPEED TERRIFIC
And Kahale, said the object was traveling from Diamond Head toward Koko Head and "at a terrific rate of speed."

Its illumination visible for five or six seconds. Mr. Richmond said, "There was no engine sound audible. It could not have been over 5,000 feet in altitude."

UNCLASSIFIED 
"It was a brilliant orange color." Like the rest Mr. Richmond said he lost sight of it when it disappeared into a cloud bank.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Intelligence Division, Hq MATS 
Andrews AFB, Washington 25, D.C.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

1. The following priority message, which concerns the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of a "USAF" plane, was forwarded by the Intelligence Officer, MATS, Hawaii.

2. "ATI Intelligence 8857. DTG 260012Z Dec 50. Under the provisions of MATS Regulation 200-2, the following information is an unidentified flying object is hereby reported: This rapid report is in exact quotation for two unidentified flying objects, as follows: 'USAF plane, while on mission, intercepted by two large bright lights, approached our aircraft SB-17, 0746, from about 3 o'clock. We could not obtain a bearing on the objects. The objects dashed at terrific speed and drew apart, then flashed my landing lights out of sight. I couldn't distinguish any particular characteristics because the lights were so bright. There was a full moon and no clouds at the time. When the lights had passed ahead we went through the 'Jeep' wash. It trailed an orange flame and were red orange color. It would disappear and reappear at a distance of about 1,000 feet. The conclusion was that it was a shining a bright floodlight at our aircraft, therefore we couldn't take evasive action. The bright lights did appear static and shine for about 5 seconds.' A report is being forwarded via teletype that this incident is being reported."

3. From the confirmation of the sighting as indicated in the following message received from the Commander, Intelligence Division, MATS, Hickam AFB, Hawaii:

"CIRCULAR CJPMO DT HL 12116. DTG 260112Z Dec 50. Unidentified luminous white circular/spherical object observed about 22-2400 coast from the Honolulu overflew into local clouds over the mountains east of Honolulu. The object followed a straight course at a constant speed estimated to be 1,200 mph. The total line of flight on the observed course was estimated at 45 to 60 seconds. The attitude was estimated at 6,000 feet. Pilots of the intercepting aircraft estimate the size to be from about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object was observed with no visibility limitations when the object entered local clouds over the mountains at Honolulu. The object could warn all illumination and was observed by ten other witnesses. The Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, has received similar reports from other observers, one of whom believes the object was a meteorite. A full report will be rendered as soon as possible."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document titled "Saucers of ILLUSIONS?". The text on the page discusses various aspects of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and related phenomena.

SAUCERS OF ILLUSIONS?
Nobody has yet explained satisfactorily just what the so-called "flying saucers" really are. The thousands of reported sightings and the many strange aerial phenomena observed remain, for the most part, unexplained. Even though there have been many explanations advanced, ranging from the absurd to the scientific, the puzzle remains unsolved. 
Some of the explanations that have been offered are:
1. Optical illusions caused by reflections, mirages, and other natural phenomena.
2. Secret experimental aircraft, balloons, etc.
3. Hallucinations and misinterpretations of natural objects.
4. Extraterrestrial spaceships from other planets.
5. Manifestations of some unknown natural force or energy.

The document appears to have been created on December 27, 1950 in Bradford, Illinois.
