Rocket portion of Sputnik III (1958 Δτ) passed about 8°E (550 mi.) of San Antonio, Texas at approx. 0233 Z on 13 July 58 at an altitude of 130 miles.

Satellite portion (1958 Δτ) passed about 6°E (200 miles) of San Antonio, Texas at approx. 0241½ on 13 July 1958 at an altitude of 135 miles.

These two objects were predicted to pass over the area at approximately four minutes on either side of the actual UFO sighting. Because of inaccuracies in prediction it is quite for the object sighted to have been either the rocket or the satellite. Obviously, it definitely was one of them, preferably Δτ because of its being higher off the horizon.

Comments re sighting No. 21

Date: 12 July 1958
Hours: 2120 - 2140 local
Place: Area near Greenway, Wisc.

a. 0240 on 12 July 1958
over Lake Huron at 135 miles altitude.

Using general observation point of 45 degrees N - 90 degrees West
the satellite (1958 ) of Sputnik III followed the rocket portion
by about 8 minutes at this particular time. It's orbit was about 115 miles
to the West of the rocket's orbit but still pretty much in the visibility
range, i.e. (visible at 45 degrees N and 75 degrees - 80 degrees) upper
half of lower Michigan. Although the direction of rotation is consistent
with that of Sputnik III, neither component seems to have been sufficiently
laid off the eastern horizon to be seen in the area described.

Comments re sighting No. 21

Date: 11 July 1958
Time: 2127 Z
Place: NE France (50 N & E)

1958 (rocket) should have been in the vicinity of the sighting
area (50 degrees N, 4 degrees E) at 2127 Z on 11 July at an altitude of
165 miles traveling in a direction of 25 degrees.

Incl #2

1958 Om (Satellite)
@ 0215'2 Delta 2 was over
Turkey.

1958 AT (Rocket)

Rocket passed over area of Oklahoma City (19°4'3"N
at 0235'2 14 July. This is about 200 miles
east of area of sighting. Rocket was at an
altitude of 135 miles so that it probably
could have been seen as reported.
