The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a report or incident related to Project Blue Book.

Radar sighting of 7 (1958-07-02) objects west of Randolph AFB, Texas at 13 July 58 at an altitude of 130 miles.

Satellite portion (1958-07-02) passed about 6-6 (2000 miles) for duration, disappear at about 09:30 at an altitude of 165 miles.

These two objects were sighted by personnel of the area at Randolph Radar Observation, on either side of the airfield tracking a suspect UFO fighting. Because these incidents were in conjunction with multiple, confirmed, and coordinated by the sightings of aviation, it is concluded that the object in the airfield was unknown, definitely, definitely observed. Its definite nature was one mystery, possibly a test of some secret phenomena, Because this being high up in the atmosphere.

Document Text:
Comment re sighting No. 1:
Date: 12 July 1958 
Hours: 2120 to 2155 local
Place: Area near Greenbay, Wisc.
Object: "Sputnik III rocket" was over Lake Huron at 135 miles altitude.
Using general observation point of 45 degrees N - 90 degrees West the rocket portion of Sputnik III followed the rocket's portion to the West or the rocket's orbit but still pretty much in the visibility range until last 15 minutes or so (visible at 75 degrees - 80 degrees 4) upper half of lower Michigan. Although the direction of motion is consistent with that of Sputnik III, neither complete stage seems to have been sufficiently lighted off the eastern horizon to be seen in the area described.

Comment re sighting No. 2:
Date: 11 July 1958
Time: 2157.7
Place: NS France (50 N 4 E)
1958 (rocket) should have been in the vicinity of the fighting (50 degrees N, 4 degrees E) at 2157.7 on 11 July at an altitude of 165 miles traveling in a direction of 25 degrees.
