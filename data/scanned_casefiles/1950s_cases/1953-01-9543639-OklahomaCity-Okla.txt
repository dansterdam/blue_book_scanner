1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 6:42 p.m. 6-22-52
2. LOCATION: Oklahoma City, Okla.
3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN 
10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Witness reported seeing an object which appeared to be 6 to 8 feet in diameter and moving at an estimated speed of 300 mph. It was observed for approximately 5 seconds before disappearing. No other pertinent details were obtained. The object size, shape, speed and manner of disappearance are consistent with reports of similar unidentified aerial objects. However, the observation is too brief and lacking in detail to permit a conclusive evaluation of the nature of the object.
