He is considered a reliable observer. He states that the subject, a light or lighted object, was visible in this area for approximately one-half hour. The entire path paralleled for approximately one-half except the beginning and the ending which were not observed. He further states that the object appeared to be moving at a tremendous rate of speed and seemed to be under intelligent control. At one point he observed the object come to a virtual standstill and then accelerate to a terrific speed. The entire report is classified for security reasons beyond the scope of this report.

R. Comments of the Reporting Officer (Cont'd)
The technical facilities contacted at Eglin AFB had no corroborative information. The film condition could not be determined accurately due to the deterioration from handling. The film condition and possible distortion or changes in the image could not be determined. No definitive conclusion could be arrived at from the available information due to the lack of correlation with other known data.
