CONTROL OPERATIONS OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL CIVIL

DEFENSE ADMINISTRATION, "SHIFT QUOTE - ABOUT
4 O'CLOCK THIS MORNING I WOKE UP AND LOOKED
OUT THE WINDOW. I SAW A GREAT BIG WHITE BALL
IN THE SKY. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE
BUT AS I WATCHED IT WHILE IT APPEARED TO BE
TOO STATIONARY FOR A PLANE AND MUCH BIGGER
THAN THE STARS. I FIRST SAW IT OVER THE TOP
OF A TREE OUTSIDE MY WINDOW. AS I WATCHED
IT SEEMED TO SWING EACH AND FORTH LIKE A PENDULUM
AND GAVE THE ILLUSION OF LEAVING A TRAIL OF
VAPOR OR SMOKE. IT MOVED UPWARD AND I WATCHED
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT."
