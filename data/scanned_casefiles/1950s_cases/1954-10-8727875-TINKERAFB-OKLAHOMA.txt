2. LOCATION
TINKER AFB, OKLAHOMA

3. SOURCE
MILITARY

10. CONCLUSION
OTHER:
RADAR BEACON

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
UNK

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Obs on FPS-10, (JPI scope) Upon initial pick-up, speed was
in excess of 3200 nautical mph, but changed to 250 nautical
mph, before turning from its 340 deg heading to a 160 deg
heading away from the radar site. The target appeared in size,
shape and brilliance equal to normal IFF*.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
UNK

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
GROUND RADAR

7. COURSE
UNK

COMMENTS:
Radar frequency interference very probably caused by signal
from beacon (i.e. AN/FPN-11). See case file for complete
analysis.

8. PHOTOS

■ No

COMMENTS (In narrative style, expand on your evaluation as checked above. Your comments, guidance and helpful criticisms are
appreciated by collectors. Carefully prepared and detailed Evaluation Records will improve the quality of reporting and
provide you with intelligence information of higher quality.)

1. Several references in the report refer to similarity to "PPS nature". This similarity refers to several spaced signals (coding) rather than a single return signal due to a beacon signal (such as AN/APN-11) triggered by another radar (not the one operated by 7656th ACGW) at almost the same PRF as the PPS of the WS-10 of the 7656th.

2. If the return is a single pip (not coded) then it could be either the beacon referred to above, or an interfering signal from another radar set in the same frequency band, and with a PRF almost the same as the WS-10.

3. The approach, turn around, and departure of the signal is caused by the PPS of the WS-10 and the interfering signal drifting toward each other in frequency, crossing over (at the turn around point) and then separating again.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most of the text in the body of the document is illegible due to poor image quality]

Signatures at the bottom of the page are also illegible.

At the top right of the document, "UNCLASSIFIED" is clearly visible.

The document appears to be an "INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" with the classification "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom of the page. However, most of the text on the page is illegible due to poor image quality, faintness, or scanning issues. I can make out the document type and classification, but cannot confidently read the specific details or content of the report.


- page 4 -

The text in the image is largely illegible due to poor image quality and scanning. The only clearly visible text is:

UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

The rest of the document appears to be a form or report with text that is too blurry to accurately transcribe.


- page 5 -

The text I can clearly read is:

UNCLASSIFIED

(at the top and bottom of the document)

Most of the text on this page appears to be illegible due to poor image quality, faintness, or scanning issues. The document seems to be a form or report with multiple lines of text, but I cannot make out the specific words or content.


- page 6 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

UNCLASSIFIED

(At the top and bottom of the document)

The rest of the text appears to be illegible due to the poor scan quality. The document contains a circular grid or diagram in the center of the page, which looks like a radial coordinate system or compass rose with concentric circles and radial lines.
