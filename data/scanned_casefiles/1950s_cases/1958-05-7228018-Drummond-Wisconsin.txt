1. Photographic film and prints pertaining to Hanson UFO sightings have been examined and because of the extremely poor photographic results, no analysis of subject can be made except the tree tops in two of the photographs. The complete roll of film shows developing streaks, fuzziness, pin holes, light-and fog throughout, with absolutely no identifiable subject other than tree tops.

1. UFO report and enlargements of prints have been thoroughly examined.
Briefly, our analyses indicate the following:

a. Even under magnification, prints show absolutely no identifiable
object other than tree tops, developing flaws and streaks, pin-
holes, light, and fog. No indication made, by circle or arrow,
which of these were considered as UFO's by Sources. The photo-
graphy is exceedingly poor.

b. There is no compelling reason to conclude that the object
observed was other than a very bright star, object observed
for over one hour, standing still, bright and blinking.

c. There were three stars of first magnitude brilliancy in the
sky at the times and places given: VEGA (to the NE), ARCTURUS
(overhead and slightly N), and REGULUS (W-NW).

2. Report form submitted does not provide all the EEI's required,
and is not in conformity with paragraphs 15 and 19, AFR 200-2, "Intelligence
Channels 6 February 1958, whose directives are mandatory for Intelligence
units.

3. In compliance with paragraph 19c of aforementioned Air Force
regulation, attached are the prints and negatives submitted for return to
source.
