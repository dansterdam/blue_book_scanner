By: Capt. W. King, Operations Officer

SUMMARY:
At 0920 hours, 23 July 1952, the Wing PIO office, 4709th Defense Wing, received the following message from AAA: "Five people sitting in tent, 22 July saw a huge light which seemed to be traveling from northeast to southwest, proceeded by a huge light which seemed to be towering in the sky." This information was forwarded to the 5858th Air Base Group for investigation. And was investigated by Sergeant Thomas G. Washburn, Jr., Intelligence Technician. His complete report is forwarded.

The and the other members of the observing party report that they saw a bright translucent light in a tent on a clear night, apparently a huge light which remained at a constant distance from the object at all times. The object was observed from two to three different and changing slightly by direction but at all times from northeast to southwest. After its disappearance it was not seen again.

Report of Investigation of Unidentified Object Sighted in the Air on
28 July 1952 at Pennington, N.J. by 1st Lt. James H. Channon, AF

At 1100 hours, 28 July 1952, I was instructed by Major Joseph R. Tury,
Intelligence Officer, 246th A.D. Base Group, to investigate an unidentified flying
object sighted near Pennington, N.J. by local civilians. The investigation was
conducted as a personal interview at 1700 hours, 24 July 1952. Statements and
connections were reviewed.

At 1700 hours 24 July 1952 an interview of three of the observers at
Pennington was conducted. [Redacted text]

All observers agree that the object was following a straight course across the
sky, and that the aircraft following the object remained the same distance
from it at all times. They state that the object was traveling in a northerly
direction at a very high rate of speed. The witnesses stated that the object
was larger than any aircraft. The witnesses agreed that the object was a very bright
object, a greenish-white color. Only one did not see details, and all observers confirmed
to within 1/4 to 1/8 of a mile of each other. Visibility was good. The observers
were able to distinguish in hindrance of this nature, size of the observers were able
to estimate, in very reasonable accuracy, to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in
object's propulsion area. No trail or exhaust was seen, and statements of
all the observers coincided. In the last 24 hours, several local citizens were
the same speed as the following aircraft. In bar of the observers were able
to estimate, it was very definitely known and acknowledged to be a fast
maneuver. The altitude stated that possibly the object was flying at about
1500 feet. With the aircraft, no definite conclusion was arrived at.

No other pertinent or unusual features of the object were noted, and observers
say that the incident occurred in a clear or three minutes. The
observers were very close, it was extremely hot, and observers say that there
just have been quite a lot of humidity in the air. There was no breeze and
no clouds were to be seen in the sky. The observers were somewhat
overall time upon the number of fireballs flitting throughout the
vicinity. All observers agree that no particular part of the craft could be
very distinctly identified. In this instance the report says that by longitude the reference to the length
of the object is made.

All observers agree that in all parts of their description of the object
they were in very close variation in any of the narrative detail they came to
give. I have enclosed two other reports of an incident of this nature occurring
on the night of 22 July 1952, and am merely a true narrative, this being
corroborative evidence of the reported sighting. Also enclosed are the names
of the crew members of the following aircraft, and request from the
some of the crew members of the following aircraft, and request from the
Director of Intelligence.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

FROM (Group) 4608th Air Base Group, Mitchel Air Force Base, Hempstead

REPORT NO. 13-14-522    PAGE 3 of 6 PAGES

The Force makes a routine check of all air crews that traveled from northeast to southwest on the night of 22 July 1952.

The next item in this investigation report will be copies of the statements of each of these crews.

STATEMENT BY 1ST LT. [redacted]

On the evening of July 22nd as I sat in the back yard with [redacted] and saw visitors, my light-plane, this [redacted] unknown and unidentified object was moving across the sky, which seemed to follow a set course, repeatedly following the same path. The object was first sighted at 2150 hours, approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in a straight course and was followed by the aircraft as long as was in sight. I was unable to determine any reasonable explanation for the object. It was only visible a few seconds. Those near me could see it and it appeared to be flying from west to northwest.

I have no additional information to contribute. The object with its distinct movements and unusual features of the object. This stating that no other westward or unusual features of the object. This sighting took approximately two-three minutes. The weather was very clear and there were no clouds. I was able to see-in the sky. There was no breeze and aircraft were to some all intents and purposes stationary. No indication of any particular direction or identifying features. To the best of my knowledge no identification or determination could be made. The following object seemed to be the only aircraft in the general area. The aircraft type was not identified. The object was located in the area two to three lengths ahead of the aircraft's and seemed to follow exactly the same course as the aircraft. I can give no other information concerning this incident.

STATEMENT BY 2ND LT. [redacted]

I have read the statement of [redacted] and concur with him. Concerning the unidentified object sighted at 2150 o'clock on the night of 22 July 1952, I recall the object appeared to me as though it were a copper penny only half of which was discernible. I would like to reiterate that the object was followed by the aircraft across the sky and increased its speed (about 15 degrees). I could check to some of all air traffic in the general area in the event that it was sighted by my crew members of the incident.

When I first saw the object it appeared motionless so that it appeared fixed from the same distance from the airplane that was visible and at the same height 15 degrees.

[Dialogue appears to be a back-and-forth interview/investigation about an unidentified aerial object, with questions and responses, but most specific details are redacted]

Some key phrases that are visible include:
- "The sky was extremely clear"
- "Have you ever observed any object such as this before?"
- "It was just about the same size as a quarter moon"
- "Was it also the same size as a quarter moon?"
- "It was a little bit larger than a star"

SUBJECT: IN GRAY PENDANT HANGING CONCERNING RELIABILITY OF OBSERVER:

I would judge all the observers of this incident that I was able to contact to be fairly reliable. Both were ladies of approximately forty-five years and appear to be cool, well-poised, and nothing disturbed that they were not discernibly shocked. Incidentally as is occurred. Neither appears to possess a nervous temperament.

I interviewed Mrs. [redacted] who was in attendance at Navy's College in New Jersey, Indiana, I would judge that the observer's commentary is 0.5 credible.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion I make a brief summary of the incident on the night of 22 July 1952, at 2120 hours, an unidentified object was sighted in the sky over Pennington, New Jersey ( Latitude 40.3 Longitude 74.8 Degrees West). Two persons, Mrs. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted] who were contacted immediately, and Mrs. [redacted] who was recently in the area, both saw the object appeared to be a light which drifted along in front of an aircraft.

The incident is to some degree unique in that the witnesses could not make up their minds other than to say it was slightly larger than a star, and its speed appeared to be slow. The movement was from Southeast to Northwest, in a westwardly direction and disappeared by traveling until the eye could no longer see it. The witnesses were quite definite that no meteorological conditions could have caused the incident. After its disappearance it was not seen again.

STATEMENT BY REPORT WRITER:

I have coordinated with Capt. Landburg during all phases of this investigation and concur with his evaluation of the sources and of the report.
