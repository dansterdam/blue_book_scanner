AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO. TN-1-235
DATE: 25 SEP 1952
PAGE: 2 OF 5

The Commanding Officer of the 61st Fighter Interceptor Squadron, located at New Castle County Airport, Wilmington, Delaware, reported the following:

At approximately 1255 hours on 23 Sep 1952, a bright object was observed at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet, traveling at an estimated speed of 600 to 700 mph. The object was first observed in a north-westerly direction and after observing it for approximately 30 seconds, it disappeared from view in a southerly direction. 

At the time of observation, the weather was clear, with unlimited visibility. The object was first observed by a Technical Sergeant who was on alert duty. The object was described as being round or oval in shape, and appeared to be white or light grey in color. No trail or exhaust was observed. The object was observed to be traveling in a straight and level course. After the object disappeared from view, the Sergeant immediately reported his observation to the Flight Operations Officer. The Flight Operations Officer stated that he also observed the object visually for a short period of time.

All personnel on duty in the tower at the time of the observation were interviewed, and all accounts were essentially the same. The Commanding Officer stated that he had made an entry concerning this incident in the 61st Fighter Interceptor Squadron Operations Log. 

No other reports of this incident have been received from other sources.

Subject: Flying Object Report - Pennington, N.J.

1. THIS OFFICE HAS RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CONCERNING A SIGHTING OF A FLYING OBJECT WHICH WAS OBSERVED IN THE VICINITY OF PENNINGTON, N.J., ON 12 AUGUST 1952.

2. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 PM. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 2 MINUTES. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET IN DIAMETER AND CIRCULAR IN SHAPE.

Transcribing the text from the document:

I would judge the objects to be luminous meteors. I would judge that 2. About 2-3 minutes duration of observation 3. The objects appeared to be traveling from the northwest toward the southeast at an estimated altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet. 4. The objects appeared to be spherical in shape and bluish-white in color. 5. The objects appeared to be traveling at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. 6. The objects disappeared from view when their altitude increased to a point where they were no longer visible to the observer.
EVALUATION: It is considered highly possible that the objects observed were luminous meteors. The description of their shape, color, speed and duration of observation is consistent with the characteristics of meteors.
