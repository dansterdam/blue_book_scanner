SUMMARY:

The afternoon of Wednesday, 4 May, 1955 let Lt Joseph T. Tept AC26632L
wait in car on the ramp at Keflavik Airport, Iceland viewing and
while others of a crew. On returning, we walked toward the runway
while still some hundred or feet from the tower I was toe to observe at
about 100 feet away, a white, translucent, somewhat round object
to locality then as they passed across the 1 1/2 mile cite, and from view most
20 degrees from the horizon being close over that exact spot for a few of
same.

I didn't give the presence of mind to count them but estimate approx.
1 to 1 1/2 miles an hour. The car was parked facing west. The object was
in the other cars in one general area. A few were nearby, would
probably walk or stand around. I recall, the object was not too far
and it did slow up as if to slow down. It was very small and slow. All was through
it in and out slow. I was almost but very much surprised. Well, toward
the end like smoke. This brief time, was almost in a state, were object came
not clear but on last brief time, was more of a square, and all were more
and more of a same size and round. We, the more harmonic, other turning
great but were not. Insure I would say, they looked like a lot of mix of map-
nets all had been several, quite white.

I would estimate there at considerable altitude and travelling at
great speed. I did check the time on my watch which was accurate and read 1256.2.

At approximately 1336, I was walking across the ramp above the British
Air Lines object flying at approximately 25 to 23,000 feet. I also saw the
objects flying were in groups of two. In my estimation, the objects, however,
were traveling at a moderate trail for about 2 record mile on height and
two groups were in view to me about 1 or 5 seconds. The objects were in trail
formation and were oval in shape, not spread. They were oval in shape, having
a size of 10 to 70 feet. The objects were traveling at a tremendous rate of
speed, well over 1,000 knots. These objects were not jet aircraft, having
no jet exhaust. From my observation, these objects were the color of oxidized
silver and did not reflect light. These objects were the color of oxidized silver and did not reflect light.
