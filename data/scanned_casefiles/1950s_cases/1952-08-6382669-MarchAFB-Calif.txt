SUMMARY: (State main facts of report, single-spaced paragraph. Indicate source and reliability of information)

1. This is a report of flying "Saucers" in the vicinity of March
Air Force Base which were observed by two Air Force airmen assigned to March Air
Force Base on 23 August 1952.

2. A summary of the description follows:

a. The object was oval shaped; it left no vapor trail; no speed was
noted and it was estimated to be at an altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet.
The flight was a straight course approximately from Northwest to Southeast and
was visible only while in the sun's rays. It was estimated to be traveling
at a rate 2 to 3 times faster than the conventional jet fighters.

b. The occurrence was at 1915 hours PST. The length of time observed
was approximately 30 seconds.

c. The sighting was made by 2 Air Force airmen while sun bathing in
the late afternoon in the town of Beaumont which is approximately 2 miles
North of March Air Force Base.

d. No observing instruments were available. The 2 observers were in
the immediate vicinity of one another.

e. No estimate of reliability can be attempted by the reporter.

f. Sky conditions were clear and unlimited. No report on wind
conditions is available.

g. A rough sketch is enclosed.

Object sighted as: about 1915 hours 27 Aug 52 from Biermont. Directly overhead.

(1) Object shaped like a football - my first impression was that of resembling a cheap clear light bulb. The sun reflected from it a color that in no way resembled that which is reflected from a military plane.

a. There was no sound - vapor trail, etc.
b. Object traveled in a straight line.
c. Object traveled at a great speed - much faster than any aircraft.
d. Object was visible for a period of about thirty seconds.
e. Object was visible only during the time it took for it to cross the area covered by the sun's rays, and disappeared upon leaving that area.

f. A Jet fighter proceeded in the direction from which the object came - about ten minutes later.

When the object was disappearing was about the only time you could determine that it was oval shaped. There was only one object, and it did not leave a vapor trail.

What I noticed mostly was the unusual light and the speed. It looked like a fighter plane in size at about 20 to 25 thousand feet. It was moving in a straight flight southeast. As soon as it got out of the rays of the sun I disappeared about 30 seconds after I had first seen it. I was in Bigerement at the time at a friend's house.

The weather was very clear at the time. About 5 minutes later there was a jet aircraft flying west and one to the east, at the speed of the two jet aircraft just afterwards I would say the object was traveling 2 to 3 times as fast.
