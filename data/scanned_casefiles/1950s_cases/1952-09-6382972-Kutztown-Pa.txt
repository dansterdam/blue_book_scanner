---THE SKIES OF NEW MEXICO, HE COULD MAKE IT RAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS LATER IN NEW ENGLAND. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, HE CAN REST UP FOR A WHILE...MY WINDSHIELD WIPER ISN'T WORKING.

ALL SORTS OF STRANGE THINGS GOING ON IN THE SKIES THESE DAYS. THE AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS AT WRIGHT FIELD HAVE RECEIVED A SET OF PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN RECENTLY BY JOHN SMITH, A FARMER NEAR KUTZTOWN, PA, JOHN SAYS HE SAW A STRANGE DISC-SHAPED THING HOVERING OVER HIS FARM FIELDS; SO HE GRABBED HIS CANDID CAMERA AND PHOTOGRAPHED THE THING, WHATEVER IT WAS, IN THE PICTURES IT SHOWS UP VERY MUCH LIKE THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT PHOTOGRAPHED NEAR MCMINNVILLE, OREGON IN MAY OF 1950.

HOW'S BUSINESS? CONSUMER CREDIT, WHICH MEANS INSTALLMENT PURCHASING HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME HIGH OF MORE THAN 21 BILLION DOLLARS. CONSUMER CREDIT IS CONSUMER DEBT...A DEBT WHICH MUST BE PAID OUT OF FUTURE WAGES. IT REDUCES NEXT YEAR'S RETAIL PURCHASING POWER BY MORTGAGING NEXT YEAR'S WAGES NOW, WHEN THE COUNTY PLUNGED INTO THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN 1929, WE HAD 0 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF INSTALLMENT PURCHASES ON THE BOOKS...NOW WE HAVE 21 BILLIONS. IT'S A WARNING SIGNAL WORTH WATCHING CLOSELY.

HOW'S BUSINESS? WHILE THE NATION'S NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES HAVE BEEN CRYING ABOUT CREEPING SOCIALISM AND RUINOUS TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS, THE REAL TRUTH OF THE SITUATION HAS BEEN OBSCURED IN THIS FLOOD OF CROCODILE TEARS. AT THE END OF THIS YEAR, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, AMERICAN CORPORATIONS WILL HAVE FORLY FIVE TWICE AS MUCH EQUIPMENT THAN THEY HAD AT THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO. THIS IS NOT THE DOLLAR VALUE OF THESE ITEMS, BUT THE PHYSICAL ASSETS ACTUALLY OWNED. FROM 1939 TO THE PRESENT TIME, NET WORKING CAPITAL OF AMERICAN CORPORATIONS HAS INCREASED 300%...AFTER PAYING ALL TAXES, AS THE NEWSPAPER LABOR POINTS OUT, THIS MEANS THAT THE CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA HAVE ACCUMULATED MORE WEALTH IN THE PAST 13 YEARS THAN THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCUMULATE IN THE PRECEDING 160 YEARS OF THIS NATION'S HISTORY. WHILE SOCIALISM WAS CREEPING, THEIR PROFITS WERE LEAPING.

NEW YORK CITY — SENATOR WILLIAM LANGER, NORTH DAKOTA REPUBLICAN, TOLD THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMAN WAS "A GREAT STATESMAN WHO COULDN'T BE BOUGHT AND WHO COULD NOT BE BULLDOZED. HE HAS LED THE FIGHT FOR THE COMMON PEOPLE AS ONLY A GREAT STATESMAN COULD HAVE LED IT."

TONIGHT SEN. IRVING IVES, NEW YORK REPUBLICAN , ADDRESSED THE LETTER CARRIERS. HE LASHED OUT AT POSTMASTER GENERAL DONALDSON AS A POWER HUNGRY OFFICIAL...DEAF TO ALL PUBLIC COMPLAINTS OF THE BREAK DOWN IN THE NATION'S POSTAL SERVICE.

--- O O ---

PHILADELPHIA — GENERAL EISENHOWER GOT A ROUSING RECEPTION IN THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE TODAY...AND HE RESPONDED BY MAKING WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS REGARD AS HIS BEST SPEECH TO DATE.
