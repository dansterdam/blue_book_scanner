AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (Short Title: FLYOBJECT)
LOCATION: Central California
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 25 July 1952
DATE OF INFORMATION: 28 July 1952
HEADQUARTERS AIR DEFENSE COMMAND: Ent AFB, Colorado
SUMMARY: (Last paragraph reads: Summarc. Case under investigation)
One unidentified object was observed visually for approximately one and one-half hours by Ground Observer Corps personnel located near San Raphael, California, on 25 July 1952. The object was disc-shaped, bright white in color and appeared to travel at an estimated speed of 150 M.P.H. at an altitude between 10,000 and 20,000 degrees. One of the observers said the unidentified object may have been an astronomical light possibly coming from the middle of the object.
The observers were located at the G.O.C. Post in Novato, Calif.; at the time of the sighting. The observers were S/Sgt. George G. Owens (USAF retired) and Sgt. Nicholas Martucci.
The Weather Officer, 4th Air Division (Def) reported the weather in his area as scattered clouds at 10,000 ft. with winds at 20,000 ft. were 130° at 7 knots.
Information from the Control Center, 4th Air Division, indicated that 2 jet aircraft were vectored to investigate the sighting but no contact was made.
No physical evidence of the sighting was reported. No identification action was taken.
Opinion of Reporting Officer: Based on a review of the observer's report, it is the opinion that the sighting was an astronomical light or instrument such as a reflecting satellite or other object. The extreme altitude and reported speed of the object is not believed to be characteristic of known aircraft.

SAN RAEFAEL, CALIF.
6 JULY 1952
1. This report is not considered a standard UFO report, but rather a report of an investigation of an alleged UFO report.
2. On 6 July 1952, the letter addressed to the Commanding General, ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, and dated 5 July 1952, was received by this office. The letter was written by Mr. - -..., who resides at -... St., San Rafael, Calif.
3. In his letter, Mr. - - - states that on the evening of 3 July 1952, at approximately 2200 hours, while watching television in his home, he and his wife observed an unidentified aerial object in the northeast sky. He states that the object appeared to be in the shape of a flattened pear and that it appeared to be giving off a dim reddish-orange light. He further states that the object appeared to be moving very slowly and that it remained visible for approximately ten minutes before disappearing.
4. After receiving Mr. - - -'s letter, this office contacted him by telephone and requested that he make a more detailed statement of his observation. Mr. - - - willingly cooperated and gave the following additional details:
a. The object was first observed at approximately 2200 hours on 3 July 1952, in the northeast sky at an angle of approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.
b. The object appeared to be stationary for the first few minutes of the observation, then began a slow upward and northward movement.
c. The object did not appear to be rotating, but rather seemed to be drifting.
d. The object was observed through a window in Mr. - - -'s home, the window being approximately 10 feet wide by 6 feet high.
e. The object appeared to be approximately 1/4 to 1/2 the size of a full moon as seen from the observer's position.
f. The object gave off a dim reddish-orange light which did not appear to be pulsating or flickering.
g. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view.
