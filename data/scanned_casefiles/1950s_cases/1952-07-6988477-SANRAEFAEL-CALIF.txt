AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (Short Title: FLYOBPTS)
AREA REPORTED ON Central California             FROM (Agency) Dir. of Intl. 2d Lt. Hamilton AFB, Calif.

DATE OF REPORT 4 August 1952         DATE OF INFORMATION 28 July 1952         EVALUATION C-3

SUMMARY (Owe case only, 2d Air Div. FLYOBPTS, 28 July 1952)

One unidentified object was observed visually for a period of approximately one minute at 0501 Pacific Daylight Time, 28 July 1952. The object was described by observers as being star shaped but like a ball. Object was reddish-yellow in color and traveling at an estimated speed of 150 M.P.H. at an altitude between 10,000 - 15,000 feet. Object was on a heading of about 280 degrees. One of the observers said the unidentified object may have been an aircraft with landing lights on. No sound was heard coming from the unidentified object.

The observers were located at the G.O.C. Post in Novato, Calif. at the time of the sighting. The observers were: Lt. Grover C. Owens (USAF retired), telephone no. Novato 578 and Mr. Phillip Nesbitt, telephone no. Novato 991.

The Weather Officer, 26th Air Division (Det) reported the weather in the Novato area as clear with 10 miles visibility. Winds at 10,000 ft. were 080 at 17 knots. At 20,000 ft. winds were 130° at 7 knots.

Information from the Control Center, 26th Air Division, indicated that a Navy fighter was in the immediate area of the reported sighting at 20,000 ft. at the time of the sighting.

No physical evidence of the sighting was reported. No identification was taken.

Comments of Preparing Officer:

Since one of the observers was of the opinion that the sighting was an aircraft in the area and since a Navy fighter was known to be in the area of the sighting at that time, it is believed that this sighting was an aircraft in the area.

(The rest of the legend text is partially illegible)

The document appears to be a technical chart with a complex grid showing temperature and altitude relationships, with a detailed legend explaining the diagram's components. The chart is titled "Pseudo-Adiabatic Diagram" and labeled as "Chart ML-124A".

At the top of the page, partially legible text:

The rest of the page appears to be a graph or chart with gridlines, with several plotted points connected by lines. The graph has numerical scales on both the vertical and horizontal axes, but the specific labels are not clearly legible. The graph appears to be a technical or scientific plotting of some kind of data points.
