and received a reply from one Col. Carl M. Neilson, of the 4750th Air Materiel Wing (Maintenance), who stated that the object reported was a weather radar test equipment. The statement that the object reported was "...in direct form of interrogation is contrary to air force policy."

Now Capt Macaubin had just enough of this so he succeeded in obtaining a copy of this letter from the HQ USAF to clarify the matter. He does not agree to the statements made in the letter "that the object reported was a weather radar test equipment." His statement indicates that the object observed was not the same as the Langley or White Sands or any other radar test equipment. 

The affidavit apparently put the Legislative Liaison Officer Mr. Hardy on VAC S26 who then directed that this matter and the affidavit be sent to Mr. Hardy as follows:

In view of your further interest in this matter and the affidavit of Mr. Lerry C. Bryant, the Legislative Liaison officer has directed that this affidavit be forwarded to you. 
...This sighting was not reported to...Langley, or other commands of the Air Force, as far as this information indicates. However, it was reported to Langley....
...and since no one else in the area reported this, the urgency of the situation was considered directly connected and since no one else in the area reported this, the urgency of the situation was considered directly connected.

Mr. Bryant's statement indicated he was notified by the 4750th Air Materiel Wing (Maint) that a radar call of 23 objects had been received on several occasions and that a T-33 jet had been scrambled to intercept and investigate the information which he volunteered would be released in Report 21-27, but contained insufficient evidence to allow any valid conclusions.

for the low altitude, since an enemy would attempt to avoid
detection by our radar. The sighting was followed by a radioactive deposit in the area. However, it has been reported
as an increase in the radioactivity of the area it might now be
due to natural causes.

From the material collected by Bryant and investigators,
the Air Force has no definite conclusions. The object was
reminiscent of the famous Fitzgerald case, in which the
civilian investigators claimed that the object was some kind
of naval or military device, but which was never identified.
It is well known in the area and do not have a questionable
reputation regarding their observations, so we are requested
to accept their report as an accurate description of what they
observed. If you, the readers of this report, are dissatisfied
with my analysis of this case, I will appreciate over-all consideration or any other observed objects or incidents which
you have witnessed and consider important. We recommend
they contact this office for further assistance.

We believe this country's citizenry is entitled to know
all the facts of the UFO problem. Since incidents or sightings are infrequent in this area, and where we lack positive
evidence, we want everyone who can contribute to this knowledge
to do so. All letters received will be read and evaluated. We
request that all such data be forwarded to this office.

It appears to be a typed document that contains text describing an interview with an unidentified person regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting on October 13, 1959 on U.S. Government property located at 39 07 13N 76 00 15W. The text provides details about the sighting, the witness's observations, and the witness's impressions during the interview.

Attachment Number 1

In 13 October 1959 a flying object, shooting across the sky, was observed on U.S. Government property located at 39 07 13N 76 00 15W and reported as follows:

No. 34, a 15, and - - - -, age 34, were in a swampland northwest of the Plum Island dome (range), when they observed, at approximately 9:00 PM, a bright, white, circular object, shaped like a plate or dish, moving quickly and silently through the sky at an altitude of 75 to 90 feet above the ground. There was a dull red or reddish-orange glow around the object, which appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. No wings, doors or other openings could be seen. The object moved in a steady, horizontal path and remained in view for about 45 to 60 seconds before disappearing. The witnesses stated the object was very bright and fired at them briefly before disappearing. They indicated they were very frightened and fired at the object. After the third shot he closed his eyes and rubbed them with his hand, at which time the object disappeared. They were so impressed by the brightness of the object that their eyes were affected for some time afterward.

The subject's mother appeared during the interview and stated that her son returned from hunting in a highly nervous state and showed her the rifle. In her opinion, he is a truthful boy and all night with him trying to keep him calmed down. 

I was impressed by the youth's calm answers to the usual questions required by Air Force investigators. He described the object with precision and consistency and showed no indication of fabrication. His use of terms such as "self-luminous", "reddish-orange glow", "horizontal path", and size measurements indicate a higher-than-average awareness and powers of observation. His impression that the object was "like aluminum" was also left with the distinct impression that the youth was telling the truth and that his story evoked a serious interest.

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, TEAM "C", SAFLL
ATTENTION: Major Allen F. Vill

SUBJECT: Reply to Congressman Hardy's UFO Inquiries

The following will serve as a basis for reply to Congressman Hardy's UFO inquiries:

Dear Mr. Hardy:

I refer to your recent inquiries concerning unidentified flying objects in behalf of Mr. 

The 7 February 1960 UFO sighting in the mid-west was not reported to the United States Air Force and, therefore, the Air Force did not analyze or evaluate this sighting.

The 1948 top secret report officially concluding UFOs were real is non-existent. By "real" we assume Mr. _ means they were objects observed by competent observers. Captain Ruppelt's evidence in his book of 25 February 1960 refers to letters or memoranda of individuals whose personal opinions may have reflected these views. There has never been an official Air Force report with this conclusion.

The Poguekon, Virginia sighting on 19 October 1959 was not reported to Langley Air Force Base or the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center. The statement that the Air Force questioned a civilian UFO researcher is erroneous. This indirect form of interrogation is contrary to Air Force policy.

Interview with Harold Moore, Jr.

On 19 October 1959, [redacted] was observed an unidentified flying object while driving in U.S.S. on 25 May 1950, and offered to furnish photographs of unidentified flying object at that time.

The object was in the company of [redacted] at the time of sighting, located 350 yards in their attention to it. The object appeared silvery in color with a black dome in the center. It was in silence and made no sound of firing by jet or rocket. The object surrounded by a luminous glow which made it appear larger than it actually was. It hovered over the grass around the object, and although it was about dusk, the surroundings of the object were clearly visible. The object was observed for about a minute and then gradually climbed vertically upwards at a terrific speed. There was no contraction or diminution in size during its ascent, and it disappeared from sight.

[Redacted] seemed that [redacted] was attempting to coordinate the details given by [redacted] and which identified to these eyewitnesses by an officer superior. He stated that the passage of the object was witnessed by several people, but it is doubtful that any other photographs were obtained. It was described as to those objects, in 1 instance as a "solid disc-shaped object" and in another instance as "a single light as large as a star". Its size was estimated at 150 yards. This explanation seems quite reasonable. Most of the objects described in this manner have turned out to be conventional phenomena. It is necessary to evaluate the incident as being completely fabricated or the witnesses merely imagined or exaggerated what they saw. This material appears to be necessary for them to prepare a pat story and then appear more impressive.

MAR 31 1959

Dear Mr. __________,

This is in response to your request of 18 March 1959 in behalf of _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _. 

On 7 February 1959 sightings of the alleged "flying saucers" reported in the area were examined by a team from the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC). The analysis of the sightings by the scientific personnel concerned concluded that the sightings were conventional aircraft. An additional investigation of the 7 February 1959 sightings was initiated by direction of the office of the _______, who assumed it required a more comprehensive study. This study, which is still in progress, has not yet resulted in any findings of an unusual nature.

The incidents of 7 February 1959 were not reported to higher headquarters as unidentified flying objects since the analysis of the sightings by the scientific personnel concerned concluded that they were of a conventional nature. You may be assured that any sightings of unidentified flying objects which cannot be explained in a conventional manner by the technical personnel are reported expeditiously through command channels to higher headquarters along with the best evidence available.

The sightings you have reported would appear to be in the same general category as those of 7 February 1959 which were found to have a conventional explanation. It is hoped that the additional investigation now in progress on the 7 February 1959 sightings may provide further information clarifying this matter. You will be advised of the findings when this investigation has been completed.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

Upon sighting and evaluation, this incident appears to be of scientific and technical interest. There is no evidence to indicate that the observed object was an aircraft or that it was a natural phenomenon, such as a meteor or a weather balloon.

The 11 July 1959 sighting resulted from a meteorological observation with radar, and the direction was plan. 

There is no Air Force order or directive in existence which orders directly or indirectly the pursuit of UFOs. All Defense Command will, of course, continue to carry out its primary mission of defending the United States under existing Security procedures. 

The Department of the Air Force has furnished this information since the Air Force has completed this investigation as far as Air Force interest is concerned. No further Air Force action is indicated at this time. They do not intend to take any more action. The Air Force people that I have talked to say this. However, the Air Force cannot over-emphasize the importance of obtaining reliable reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, since scientific investigation of such incidents could provide significant technological and scientific advances to this country.

I must inform you that considerations require that your communication on this matter be treated as confidential.

MEMORANDUM FOR MAJOR WRIGHT, SAFLL

SUBJECT: Reply to Congressman Hardy's UFO Inquiry

The following is recommended as basis for reply to Congressman Hardy:

"We have noted the contents of Mr. 's letter of 19 April, and are left with the impression that he believes the Air Force is censoring UFO information and denying to the American public data which should be available to them.

On the contrary, the Air Force policy is to provide the public with maximum information on this subject. When on occasion it is necessary to withhold data, this is done only to protect the people involved from the idle curiosity of the sensation seekers, to keep from compromising our investigative processes or to prevent exposure of gaps or deficiencies in our defense system.

The Air Force does not deny that unknown objects have been seen by responsible people. It is in the interpretation of these sightings that we are questioned. From our investigations covering the past twelve-year period, the Air Force contends that when the evidence of these sightings has been sifted through the scientific criteria it has led to the conclusion that the objects were not space craft and they did not constitute a threat to the security of this country."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report.

In view of Mr. affidavit attached to Mr. letter we wished to obtain more information on the circumstances surrounding the Poquoson, Virginia sighting, thus the delay in answering you. We have since learned that the sighting was not reported to Langley Air Force Base by the participants involved in the sighting but individuals at the Base had knowledge of the sighting through telephone calls from Mr. These calls were in the nature of inquiries as to what action the Air Force was taking rather than for the purpose of reporting the sighting. Mr. initial calls were made four days after the alleged UFO was sighted.

As a matter of information, the Air Force did not call Mr. According to the information we have, the anticipated telephone calls to the individuals mentioned in his affidavit.

I sincerely hope this information will clarify to your satisfaction the circumstances surrounding this case.

Dear
Reference is made to your further expression of interest as to the Secretary of the Air Force letter of 21 April 1950 in behalf of Mr. --------- Paragraph 1 concerning the investigation of unidentified flying objects. In view of your further interest in this matter and the affidavit under date of 19 October 1959, Langley, Virginia, lighting of 28 October 1959, information received on this matter from ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio who purportedly sighted the unidentified objects, it was however, determined by the Air Force that the object sighted on 28 October 1959 did not constitute a threat to the security of this country.

This information is offered to clarify paragraph 3 of Colonel Carl M. Hathaway's letter of 18 March 1960.

It was advised that the information contained in the affidavit concerning the sighting-on 28 October 1959 at Langley, Virginia was not considered of sufficient significance to warrant further investigation, and since the reports are not considered of sufficient significance, the matter was dropped. No one else in the area reported this sighting, the matter was dropped.

NOTE: The Air Force does not deny that unidentified objects have been sighted. During the past twelve-year period, the Air Force contends that when the verifications of these sightings have been established, they have been fully explained, identified, and did not constitute a threat to the security of this country.

Dear Sir:

On October 19, 1959, we received your letter in subject "Air Intelligence Information Concerning an Aerial Sighting" and were requested to continue an official Air Force investigation of the sighting.

As of October 30, we had neither received any further information from you nor had we any other reports of this sighting to work on. It is therefore assumed that this matter has been concluded and no further investigation is required.

If, however, you desire that we continue our investigation of this sighting, please advise us and we will be glad to do so.

As an OCR system, I can extract the following text from the document:

Dear Sir:

At your oral request, this office has further investigated the Photographs of an unidentified object which were submitted with the letter of Captain Daniel Harley dated 20 May 1959. A copy of a letter which has been sent to Captain Harley is attached hereto for your information.

As you are no doubt aware, the investigation and analysis of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) is a responsibility of the Air Force. This responsibility is directly related to the mission of the Air Force to maintain the security of the United States against known enemies and possible aggression from unknown sources. All of the reports on UFO sightings which have been submitted to the United States are carefully considered.

At the same time there are over one hundred other reasons for sightings of Unidentified flying objects. The technical and scientific evaluation of sightings is one means of assisting in determining the defense capability of the United States. However, the defense capability is only one aspect of the problem and is not sufficient in itself to justify the establishment of a scientific advisory group to carry out a continuous investigation. The conclusion of the technical and scientific evaluation is that UFO sightings do not present a direct physical threat to the national security of the United States, and do not warrant the expenditure of the large sum of money that would be required to maintain a continuous scientific advisory group solely for the analysis of reports of UFO sightings. You will note, as indicated in the newspaper article attached hereto, that an unidentified flying object was sighted and the report was evaluated by the authorities at Langley.

many others, considers himself entitled to be an unofficial advisor to the USAF PROJECTS, since he is not charged under any law with any illegal activities, and consequently it is his constitutional right to give his or his organization notoriety and publicity. Hence the inclusion in the newspaper picture of what purports to be a decoration device featured in the newspaper article to which he refers, is the scientific proof that UFOs are flying objects that come under the military classification. The Air Force has classified certain reports of such objects, and the Air Force Intelligence officers have investigated with care and ability the rest of the scientific community dedicated to satellite tracking. Should you or the Committee have any further interest in this matter I would be pleased to arrange a briefing for you by an office of the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a sighting incident involving three aircraft near Bradford, Pennsylvania on February 24, 1959. The text details the American Air Lines pilot's report of the incident, which was analyzed by the Air Force and found to be a possible sighting of three B-47 type aircraft.

The text in the document is as follows:

"THE 1952 Washington, D. C. sighting (radar and visual sightings).
WERE due to an examination investigatior completed in the fall of 1952.
In regard to the 24 February 1959 American Air Lines pilot's
sighting involving three aircraft near Bradford, Pennsylvania, the
investigation into this incident was forwarded to the United States
Air Force on 30 March 1959. The report was reviewed and the finding
was that the incident was identical to the 1952 visual sighting over
Pennsylvania border (near Bradford and Olean, New York) on the route of
American Air Lines Flight No. 739 departing Newark, New Jersey, at 7:10 p.m.
and arriving Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at 10:52 p.m. on 24 February 1959.
This geographical area is bordered by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-Akron-
Youngstown, Ohio area overflown by the United Airlines flights reporting
this sighting.
The American Air Lines pilot, Captain ________, said in his
statement submitted to the Air Force by the American Air Lines, Inc.,
"Conditions at the interval of the three flights were identical to the 1952
'Constellation' Orion." This was initially identified as a possible
solution by the Air Force with the qualifying statement that the report
submitted had not yet been analyzed and that the findings of this
investigation would be based upon completed analysis and evaluation of the written
report as submitted. The pilot's report (copy attached) also suggested
the possibility that he might have witnessed a night aerial refueling
operation. Captain __________ has not contacted the Air Force since this
statement, to change or edit it in any way.
Upon analysis and evaluation, this sighting turned out to be B-47
type aircraft accomplishing night refueling from KC-97 tankers. The
American Air Lines pilot's report of the sighting tentatively indicated
this and Air Force records showed that three B-47 type aircraft were in
the area."

Dear Sirs:

On October 23, 1959, I talked by telephone to a member of Langley's Group Operations, regarding an alleged sighting of a UFO which had been reported by observers at the Base on October 22, 1959. This individual contacted me and asked for the information which I had obtained about this sighting. 

In a telephone conversation on October 30, a Maj. S. G. Gull, of your office, could not inform me as to what subsequent action had been taken regarding this sighting. He indicated that he did not receive a copy of the Daily report of October 21, and assumed that no further action would be taken.

If no further investigative action on this case is contemplated by the Air Force authorities concerned, will you please tell me the reason for this decision?

Yours sincerely,

NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA

INCIDENT REPORT

DATE 6 October 1959 

LOCATION Langley AFB, Va.

WITNESSES: MSGT J. Frank Jablonski
A/lC Claude R. Smith

DESCRIPTION:

At approximately 11:20 PM, October 6, 1959, MSGT J. Frank Jablonski and A/lC Claude R. Smith were returning to Langley APB, Va. from Yorktown, Va. when they observed three bright lights in the sky. The lights were moving at high speed in a north-easterly direction at about 45 degrees above the horizon.

The lights appeared to be a bright white in color and triangular in shape. The lights seemed to be about the size of a 50 cent piece held at arm's length. They appeared to be spaced about 50 to 100 yards apart. 

The witnesses watched the lights for about 2 to 3 minutes until they disappeared from sight. They appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed and made no sound that was audible to the witnesses. 

The witnesses were unable to determine the altitude or exact size of the objects. Weather conditions at the time were clear.

RECOMMENDATION: None

the geographical area mentioned above on a flight traveling operation. The Tactical Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Charleston Air Force Base confirmed this fact. The position of the other two aircraft (United Airlines) and the time and distance involved supported this conclusion. On 11 October 1959 positive green sightings from a motor. All aircraft saw the motor at the same time and the direction was also constant. There is no Air Force order or directive in existence which orders Air Force pilots to pursue UFOs. Air Defense Command will, of course, scramble aircraft to identify an unknown object on their radar tracking equipment. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Government Operations Committee has indicated from time to time its interest in the subject of UFOs, and we have furnished them all the information they have requested. After preliminary investigation, the Subcommittee Staff has indicated that they do not intend to have hearings and the Air Force people that public hearings would likely give undue dignity to the subject out of all proportion to which it is entitled. The sensation seekers and the publishers of scientific fiction would profit most from such hearings, and in the long run we would not accomplish our objective of taking the aura of mystery out of UFOs. However, the Air Force stands ready to give its wholehearted cooperation to any Congressional Committee dealing with public policies on this matter should overriding considerations require them.

TEXT OUTPUT:
This report concerns the sighting of an unidentified flying object by two Air Force officers on 6 October 1959 at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The details of the sighting are as follows:
At approximately 1510 hours on 6 October 1959, two Air Force officers, Capt. Edgar J. McGuire and Lt. Robert C. Smith, were walking across the base when they observed an unusually bright, circular object in the sky at approximately 20 degrees above the horizon to the southwest. The object was silvery in color and appeared to be slowly rotating. It remained stationary for approximately 15-20 minutes before suddenly accelerating and departing rapidly to the northeast, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.
Both officers closely observed the object through binoculars and reported it as definite, solid, and metallic in appearance. They estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. No other air traffic was observed in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. The weather was clear with unlimited visibility.
This sighting was reported to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation and analysis.

THE OBJECT WAS SEEN NEAR HAMPTON ROADS, VA. AND AT THE TIME WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING ROUND IN SHAPE WITH A METALLIC APPEARANCE AND CHANGING IN COLOR FROM SILVER TO BRILLIANT BLUE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE TRAVELLING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND AFTER SIGHTING IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. WITNESSES STATED THAT IT WAS FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF BETWEEN 1500 AND 2000 FEET AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MAKING ANY NOISE. A CHECK OF THE AREA REVEALED NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN THE VICINITY AT THE TIME. THE NEAREST AIRPORT WAS APPROXIMATELY 25 MILES AWAY AND NO INFORMATION COULD BE OBTAINED ON ANY FLIGHTS FROM THERE. THERE WERE NO MILITARY ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE OBJECT OBSERVED. A LETTER ADDRESSED TO COL. DEWITT C. SEARLE, JR. HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO THIS HEADQUARTERS BUT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE (AFODC-I) HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

AS THE VARIOUS REPORTS OF STRANGE OBJECTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED FOR SOME TIME FROM VARIOUS MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE SIGHTINGS COULD NOT BE ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATED AND EXPLAINED LOCALLY. THEREFORE, ON 16 MARCH 1948, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE DIRECTED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROJECT GRUDGE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE AIR MATERIAL COMMAND, WRIGHT FIELD, OHIO, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANALYZING THESE REPORTS AND DETERMINING, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE NATURE OF THE OBJECTS REPORTED. PROJECT GRUDGE WAS OFFICIALLY DEACTIVATED ON 27 DECEMBER 1949, AT WHICH TIME IT WAS REPLACED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK, UNDER THE SAME JURISDICTION. PROJECT BLUE BOOK WAS OFFICIALLY TERMINATED ON 17 DECEMBER 1969. DURING THE OPERATION OF THESE PROJECTS, REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WERE RECEIVED FROM MANY SOURCES, INCLUDING MILITARY PERSONNEL, COMMERCIAL AIRLINES PILOTS, AND CIVILIANS. WHILE MANY OF THE REPORTED OBJECTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, BALLOONS, AND ASTRONOMICAL BODIES, A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER REMAINED UNIDENTIFIED. THE INVESTIGATION OF EACH SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS HANDLED INDIVIDUALLY AND THOROUGHLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE OBJECT REPORTED.

When considering a request to identify or name any humans in an image, I do not actually have the capability to do so, even if the image did contain a human face. As instructed, I will refrain from identifying or naming any individuals in the image and instead focus on describing and discussing the image contents objectively without reference to that ability.

Transcribing the text from the document:

"When visited, the location of the disc (circle) was not the same as that previously reported. The original location was not visible from this position. The object appeared to be a disc, silvery in color, estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in altitude. It was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes by two witnesses before it rapidly faded from sight, not accelerating, but rather appearing to slowly disappear. There was no sound associated with the observation.

This report is deemed reliable. The two observers were competent and responsible residents of the area. Their description of the object is consistent and reasonably accurate, based on the available data.

Extracted text:

The plane sighting was reported at Langley AFB, Va. on April 17, 1959. I began my investigation on April 17, 1959. I have obtained the following information from the files of the Air Force:
The object sighted was a bright light or light source that was observed at approximately 1500 hours on April 17, 1959 by several persons at Langley AFB, Va. The object was first observed low on the horizon to the north-northeast of the base. It then ascended rapidly to an estimated altitude of about 5,000 feet and moved in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed. The object was under observation for approximately 30 seconds. Several persons on the base, including experienced observers, were able to observe the object. Attempts to make visual contact by aircraft were unsuccessful. No airborne radar was able to detect the object.
The information as given by the officer in charge of the control tower at Langley AFB is as follows:
A technical sergeant and an airman first class were on duty in the control tower when the object was first observed. They immediately called the officer in charge who came to the tower and also observed the object. Several other personnel on the base also saw the object. The object was described as a bright light, brighter than any star, which appeared to be of circular or oval shape. It was under observation for approximately 30 seconds. During this time it rose rapidly from near the horizon to about 5,000 feet and moved off to the south at a very high rate of speed, faster than any aircraft the observers had seen. Several attempts were made to get aircraft airborne to intercept the object but without success. No radar contact could be made with the object.
Based on the information available, it appears that the object sighted was some type of unusual aerial phenomenon. The object did not behave in a manner characteristic of any known type of aircraft. The rapid ascent, high speed, and inability to track the object on radar would indicate that it was not a conventional aircraft. While the object could not be positively identified, the information available does not indicate that it was of extraterrestrial origin. The sighting is being filed as an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

IN THE MATTER OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
By John C. Clark, Civilian Investigator

On 6 October 1959, at approximately 7:00 p.m., EDT, I received a telephone call from a person who identified himself as Mr. Thomas Johnson, of 1622 Walnut Street, Langley, Virginia, telephone number OT 2-3426. Mr. Johnson stated that he had observed a strange object in the sky about 6:45 p.m. that evening, and that the object was still in sight as he was calling.

Mr. Johnson stated that the object appeared to be about twice the size of a normal aircraft, and that it was hovering at an estimated altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet. He added that the object appeared to be elliptical in shape, and that it was giving off a brilliant white light, which seemed to pulsate at irregular intervals. 

Mr. Johnson further stated that the object made no sound, and that it did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion. He said that he had watched the object for about 20 minutes, and that during that time it had not moved from its original position. 

I immediately contacted the Operations Office at Langley Air Force Base, and informed the duty officer of Mr. Johnson's report. The duty officer stated that he would dispatch an aircraft to investigate the area, and that he would also notify the radar station to be on the alert for any unusual activity.

About 45 minutes later, the duty officer called me back and stated that the aircraft had made a thorough search of the area, but had been unable to locate the object described by Mr. Johnson. The radar station had also reported negative results.

I then called Mr. Johnson back and informed him of the results of the investigation. Mr. Johnson stated that he was disappointed, but that he was certain of what he had seen, and that he would continue to watch the sky for any further activity.

I have no further information on this incident.

The event occurred at LAD ARMY-LANGLEY AFB, VA
On 6 OCTOBER 1959. The witness, a military person, was on duty at LAD ARMY-LANGLEY AFB, VA when he observed two bright lights in the sky. The lights were traveling in a straight line at a very high rate of speed. As the lights approached, they stopped and hovered directly overhead. The witness estimated the lights to be approximately 300 feet in diameter and 50 feet thick. The lights remained stationary for approximately 2 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. No sound was heard. The entire incident lasted approximately 3 minutes. The report was forwarded to Project Blue Book at ATIC.

FULL TEXT OUTPUT:

     This report is based on the observation of two employees of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley Field, Virginia, on 6 October 1959. The observers were Kendall R. Moore, Engineering and Technical Assistant, and John Watkins, Engineering and Technical Assistant. Both observers are considered to be reliable and credible.

     On the date and time mentioned above, Moore and Watkins were working in their office at the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, when they observed an unusual object in the sky through a window. The object was first seen at approximately 4:15 p.m. and was visible for about 4 minutes. The object was described as a flat, round, silvery, metallic object, hovering and maneuvering at a high altitude. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and seemed to be in a horizontal position. It was observed to make several very rapid angular movements, and at one point it appeared to tilt slightly, revealing what appeared to be a dark, round area or opening in the center of the underside.

     Both observers indicated that the object moved in a very unusual and unnatural manner, making sudden starts, stops, and angular turns that seemed to defy the normal laws of motion and aerodynamics. They stated that it was unlike any aircraft or other known object they had ever observed in the sky. After a period of approximately 4 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view, moving in a northeasterly direction.

     Both Moore and Watkins are experienced observers of aircraft and are thoroughly familiar with the appearance and performance characteristics of conventional aircraft. They are convinced that the object they observed was not an aircraft, balloon, or any other known flying object. They state that they have no explanation for what they saw, and that the object's performance was such that it could not have been any type of conventional aircraft.

     It is requested that this report be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and analysis.

"REPORT SOME TWO WEEKS IN FALLOUT RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT LANGLEY AFB, VA.
Subsequent to the sighting of two or more spherical objects believed to be satellite or balloon trackers, operating at an altitude of about 100 feet over the base, the officer in charge of the flight was subsequently questioned. The object was found to be four and a quarter feet in diameter and was round in shape with a dull surface. Visual observation indicated that the object remained stationary for a period of time, and was then seen to move rapidly in a horizontal direction and disappear from view. The incident took place just at sunset, which probably accounts for the difficulty in obtaining clear photographs of the object as it was difficult to obtain adequate light. The incident was reported to higher headquarters in the usual manner."

On October 21, 1959, the Newport News Daily Press carried a story stating that a Navy pilot had sighted an unidentified flying object over Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The incident was reported by the pilot, whose name was not disclosed, as a "highly unusual phenomenon." According to the report, the object was observed by the pilot for several minutes and was estimated to be about 50 feet in diameter. The pilot stated that the object performed unusual maneuvers and accelerations that were beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft. The report concludes that the object should be included in the "unknown" category.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a report or document, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page describes the sighting of an unidentified object, providing details about its size, shape, color, sound, and movement pattern.

DESCRIPTION OF THIS: According to the document, the object was circular, about four feet in diameter, with a dark center encapsulated by a six-inch-wide silvery-gray rim. It appeared to be self-illuminated and made no sound. The object's motion is described as a "falling-leaf" or pendulum type of movement, hovering directly above the observer's head and then descending in a zig-zag pattern. The document also references other sources and literature related to similar observations.

TEXT OUTPUT:

DESCRIPTION OF THIS:
Bombing range - This object emitted a blue-white light, intermittently increasing and decreasing in intensity. It hovered on a steady course and in about 30 minutes became involved in a sudden and violent maneuver, seemingly at tremendous speed, and would be invisible. 
Bryant's amazing data: This falling-leaf type of sighting varied greatly with the observational data in his possession. Some 40 or more instances of these "UFO" observations have become involved, and it is felt that a pattern of definite significance is emerging.
TIME AND DURATION OF SIGHTING: 6:12 p.m., for 12 minutes.
SIZE AND SHAPE: Circular; about four feet in diameter.
COLOR AND COMPOSITION: A dark center encapsulated by a 6-inch-wide silvery-gray rim. Metallic but had no insignia.
SOUND AND SPEED: Gave Musa the impression of a "tornado's" wind being broadcast via gravitational departing speed, too fast to estimate.
DIRECTION AND MANEUVER PATTERN: Hovered directly above Musa's head; no arrival or departure was stationary and in its descent, it dipped from side to side. 
* This "falling-leaf" or pendulum type of motion is a classic characteristic, the more publicized "unknown". References: Project Sign recommended the consideration of such observations for Project Grudge, presumed as possible evidence. The director, Col. Howard McCoy, on which this sighting has significance in relation, addressed on page 47 of Keyhoe's classic book "Flying Saucers are Real".

ALTITUDE OF UFO AND CONDITION OF WEATHER:
This UFO sighted on 23 January 1959 reportedly appeared at an estimated 20,000 feet; visibility unlimited, with no wind or clouds.
The object was observed for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes by three witnesses. It appeared to them as a brightly lighted object emitting a glowing red-orange exhaust. Its motion was described as erratic, zigzagging back and forth, and at times it appeared to move away from each other. It must be stating their experience was vividly impressed upon their minds.
The witness who was sitting on his knees, was calmly watching the object when he heard a crackling sound like static electricity. He glanced up to see the object gently coming down and then suddenly stopped. It then glided slowly back up, emitting a pale bluish-white light intermittently. The object appeared to be quite large, but then glanced as to see the entire craft gently coming down and then it quickly disappeared.
At this point, the witness became excited, and did inquire to the other observers if they had also seen the object. They replied in the affirmative. The object fired a ball of fire, only to hear the hissing of metal striking metal. At the same time, there was a discharge of light which appeared to continue in time, so extensive. Two of the witnesses had an object hovering over their position near the ground. This hovering took approximately 4 to 5 minutes, and when the object departed, it left a slight reddish glow.

Transcription of the text in the document:

On October 30, as a follow up, Bryant telephoned the Intelligence Office and asked to know the disposition of the case. He was told that the report was too cooperative. He expressed the opinion that the Intelligence Office was not doing all it could to find an explanation, and that the on-the-record account published by the Intelligence Office did not truly reflect what had happened as told to him through established information channels.

Bryant again called the home of the Intelligence Technical Sergeant and asked to be shown the complete file. He was told that the file was a confidential official document and that he could not be shown it. He pressed the Sergeant to provide him with copies of letters and replies, but was refused. The Sergeant explained that all inquirers had been advised that the file could not be made public.

Mr. Larry McCrubbin, Bryant's biology colleague in Nansemond County, Virginia, who had accompanied him to the scene on October 29, was the next person to be contacted. McCrubbin subsequently toured the Air Force base at Langley AFB on October 29, during which high-school students were visiting the site, and discussed the UFO sightings.

His series of letters and replies began on March 14, 1960. He was informed on March 28 that the data would be classified and referred to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for their study, and they were unable to furnish any information at that time. 

Congressman Hardy sent the complaint through channels and claimed that except for the call that set the original inquiry in motion, the Colonel was quite cooperative in the case.
