NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION
UNCLASSIFIED

DETAILS:

1. This investigation is opened at the direction of the District Commander presidented upon information furnished by DONALD E. DICKINSON, Director Security Division, Los Alamos Field Office, concerning the observation of a flight of unidentified aerial objects by DON E. WIEWS.

AT LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO

2. On 22 July 1952, at 1030 to 1115 hours, Mr. , a supervisor, and CARGO PILOT, observed a flight of approximately eight (8) round or elliptical objects from the Los Alamos Air Force Base. WIEWS observed the objects to be approximately 25 to 30 miles southwest of Los Alamos and traveling at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. WIEWS presumed the direction of flight to be Southwest, although it was his estimation the objects could have only been at a low altitude. He described the color as aluminum or bright metallic with varying luminosity, and estimated the size to be impossible to determine because they were so far away. WIEWS stated it would be impossible to determine aircraft type at such a distance, but he had estimated the objects to be rather large in relation to aircraft. WIEWS stated some had been observed to change direction instantly; others did not seem to remain long in one direction, zig-zagging and appearing to reverse themselves, making it impossible to keep in view with binoculars. WIEWS was engaged in other activities during this observation period, so could not maintain continuous sighting. When first seen, the objects appeared to be hovering directly overhead. The altitude was impossible to ascertain. They must have been very high because no distinguishing marks could be determined by the unaided eye. The objects appeared to the sighting to be visible only with the aid of binoculars. It was estimated the objects were in sight approximately 25 minutes, although not continuously.

3. Mr. , a CARGO PILOT, and , a FIRE DEPARTMENT, also observed this group of objects.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects, New Mexico
DATE OF INFORMATION: 29 July 1952
FROM: (Organization) 18th Air Division (Def)
TO: Director of Intelligence, USAF, Washington, D.C.
SUMMARY: (Under certain summary of report. Give significance to indent one-sentence paragraph. If features or fewer left.) In accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 20 April, subject: Unidentified Flying Objects (Short Title: FLYOBJ-T), the following report of unidentified flying object sightings is submitted:
On 29 July 1952, a civilian pilot, Lewis, then a Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, observed several objects in the sky which appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed in the vicinity of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As there was only one pair or triangular, all other the observers took turns in watching the objects through binoculars. The objects appeared to be circular in shape. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and appeared to be maneuvering in a manner which the observer considered unusual. There was no sound, trail, or tail observed. It was observed for several minutes until it disappeared from view over the horizon. The reliability of the observer is considered excellent.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"I, T. L. G., do hereby pilot employed by Cargo Air Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico, make the following statement:

On July 22nd between 1105 MST and 1135 MST, I happened to be in Los Alamos on business near the skyline of Albuquerque. Suddenly, I heard some jet fighters fly over, so along with several other persons (whose names I now do not recall, but all looking up) happened to catch sight of several objects approximately 3 to 10 in number. These objects seemed to move at an extremely high rate of speed, many times faster than any jet aircraft I have ever seen. They appeared to be about the size of a large commercial aircraft at that distance. I immediately reported this incident to Security Headquarters.

At this time, one or more (regular Navy or Army) issue field glasses, all of us took turns trying to locate the objects. When my turn came to use the glasses, I focussed them on the objects then I saw. The objects then seemed to make a 90 turn to the right at a very high rate of speed, (either down or in a southwesterly direction). It suddenly either leveled out and took (direction) or was going southwest at the same altitude. It made a 90 turn to the right. The objects then either went into or behind a straight hazy-type cloud which we believe lay over the Jemez Mountains.

Aloud, I then stated that the objects had then come toward the Airport. Going back to the skyline, the objects were no longer to be seen, the cloud cover by now having obscured them completely. The turn to the right was much sharper than is possible in our jet type aircraft. That turn was definitely much closer to a 90 change of direction than any fighter aircraft that I have observed under visual conditions.

I would estimate this object for about 2 or 3 seconds. It appeared to be oscillating in such a way as to catch the reflection of the sun several times. It had no visible means of propulsion, and leaving no condensation trail of any kind.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 29th day of July 1952.

(Signed) Glenn E. Garriott
1st Lt., USAF
Director of Intelligence"
