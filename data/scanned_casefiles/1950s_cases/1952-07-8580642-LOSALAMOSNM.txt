Eight round aluminum-colored objects flew straight and level course, then began to make erratic changes of course, darting about and reversing direction. Source viewed objects through binoculars from Los Alamos Airport tower.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation is opened at the direction of the District Commander, predicated upon information furnished by DONALD P. DICKASON, Director Security Division, Los Alamos Field Office, concerning the observation of a flight of unidentified aerial objects by DON R. WIENS.

AT LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO

2. On 22 July 1952, at 1050 to 1115 hours, tower operator, 200, "C" 23rd Street, Los Alamos, reported sighting a flight of approximately eight (8) round or elliptical objects from the Los Alamos Air Fort tower. WIENS stated the objects were in a south to Southwest direction at an estimated five (5) to fifty (50) miles distance from him. WIENS presumed the direction of flight to be Southwest, although it was in a direction going away from him and could have only been looking at a cloud. He described the color as aluminum or bright metallic with a very bright luminosity. As to size, WIENS stated it would be impossible to determine without knowing their altitude or distance, but that they must have been rather large in relation to aircraft. WIENS stated some of the objects flew in straight and level for some distance and would change direction instantly; others did not seem to remain long in one direction, but darted one way and another, even to reversing themselves, making it impossible to keep in view with binoculars. WIENS stated some period out of range, others simply were visible once instant and then with a darting movement disappeared completely. WIENS stated further that when first seen the objects seemed to be hovering directly overhead. The altitude was impossible to judge because no distinguishing marks could be seen with the aid of glasses. Due to their extreme speed it was very doubtful that they could have been balloons. For the most part they were visible only with the aid of binoculars. It was estimated that the objects were in sight approximately 25 minutes, although not continuously.

3. Mr. Caro pilot, Mr. Caro pilot, and fire department, also observed this group of objects.

SUMMARY: (Under concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part 1)

SUBJECT: FLYOBSPT

In accordance with AFL 200-5, dated 29 April, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects (Short Title: FLYOBSPT), the following report is submitted:

On 22 July 1952 at approximately 1105 MST, a pilot for Three Air Service, Albuquerque, was flying near Los Alamos at the airport writing for a flight to Albuquerque. Suddenly, some 1st fighters flew over, so along with several other people, he ran out to watch and saw 2 F-86's. On one of the two with him observed several objects in the sky which appeared to be saucer shaped. These were sighted and then looked at several times. The observation was reported to Security Headquarters immediately.

As there was only one pair of binoculars, all of the observers took turns trying to locate the objects. When Mr. [redacted] used the binoculars, he noticed a plain in the sky. He saw one of the objects through the binoculars, and it seemed to be saucer or circular shaped. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed down or in a southwesterly direction. Suddenly, it veered out (if it was descending), or if moving southward, it made a turn of 90째 to the right. The object then went into or behind a cloud. This cloud was about 15 miles southwest of the location.

The object appeared to be oscillating in such a way as to catch the reflection on one cloud over several times. A second, third, and fourth look definitely appeared to be controlled.

The reliability of the observer is considered excellent.

UNCLASSIFIED

I, [redacted], pilot employed by Cargo Air Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On July 22nd between 1105 MST and 1130 MST, I happened to be in Los Alamos at the Airport waiting for a flight to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Suddenly, I heard some jet fighters fly over, no along with several other people. I ran out to watch and saw 2 F-86's. One of the men with me (while looking up) happened to catch sight of several objects approximately 8 to 10 in number. These objects seemed to be either a ball or source in shape. These were sighted and were lost night of several times. This sighting was reported to Security Headquarters immediately.

As there was only one pair of regular Navy (or Army) issue field glasses, all of us took turns trying to locate the objects. When my turn came to use the glasses, I caught a flash in the clear sky. The object that I saw appeared to be either a cone or circular in shape and was traveling at a high rate of speed, either down or in a southwesterly direction. It suddenly either leveled out (if it was going down) or if going southwest at the same altitude. It made a 90째 turn to the right, the object then either went into or behind a cumulus type cloud which was building up over the Jemez Mountains.

The cloud was between 10 and 15 miles southwest of the Los Alamos Airport. Judging by the way the object went behind the cloud, the object must have been traveling at a very high rate of speed. Also, the turn it made to the right was much tighter than is possible in our jet type aircraft. That turn was not a direct 90째 change of direction, but it was definitely much closer to a 90째 change of direction than any fighter aircraft that I have flown or observed.

I watched this object for about 3 or 4 seconds. It appeared to be oscillating in such a way as to catch the reflection of the sun several times a second. It had no wings or tail surface and appeared to be definitely controlled.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 30th day of July 1952.
