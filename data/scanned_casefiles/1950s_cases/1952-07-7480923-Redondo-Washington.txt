SECTION D
22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "B" to show where it was when you last saw it.

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" as the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details or the object that you saw, and places on sketch beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this? (Circle One): Yes No. Then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

26.l Have seen them before, but only one at a time, usually a clear night sky, from a car while driving. Can't recall exact dates, but they have been seen over several years during 1940's and early 1950's.

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?

The object appeared to be round or oval in shape, bright in color and moving rapidly across the sky. It did not appear to have wings or a tail, and produced no sound that could be heard from the ground. My best estimate is that it was probably a type of jet aircraft, possibly some new experimental craft that was classified at the time.

28. Give the following information about yourself:

NAME:  
ADDRESS:  
TELEPHONE NUMBER:   
What is your present job? Military as Law
AGE: 25  
SEX: Male  
Last School Attended: No High school graduation  
Year of last attendance at this school: 1945

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets if necessary. We are interested in ANY detail, no matter how trivial it may seem. Your comments may add materially to the value of this report.

So I thought this one was a real one thought he was going to attack. I guess I saw it coming pretty good from out of the corner of my eye, and when they turned it on me I could see it very clearly. It didn't look like an ordinary plane, and I could tell it wasn't too high up. But I'm telling you this thing moved more like a balloon, that is to say it didn't have the speed we would expect from a jet plane or anything like that. Just going along like a balloon-crazy, but that's no ballon. Just a theory of my own. Whatever it was, it sure had me worried.
