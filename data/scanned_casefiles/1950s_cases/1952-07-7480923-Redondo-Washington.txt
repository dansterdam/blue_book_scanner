23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

I think the central is what lead to my discovery at this sight, and it was a similar night. I came on night in Clinton and I often look back now to see if I can remember then now. I thought of this it was a jet, but then I saw this thing higher up off the back of the ground then I saw running material. I was stunned that way for about two minute and then started off in - south easterly direction, hanging in about 5 minute.
