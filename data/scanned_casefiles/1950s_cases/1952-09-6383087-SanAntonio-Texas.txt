AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO. [Mostly illegible]                PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES

In compliance with AF letter 23-5, dated 27 July, 1950, the following information is submitted:

(1) This single, saucer-colored object, then sighted from a distance, appeared to be about the size of a basketball. It was the appearance with distinctly white brilliance, and seemed to be beam shaped. The sighting was observed from 2000 to 2030 hours at Marshall, Texas, on 15 Sept 52. The object was stationary, this was in the vicinity of the western sky from an altitude of approximately 30° above the horizon. Weather conditions were clear, winds were light, no clouds, and disappeared in much the same area as a light point out.

(2) This object or trail was observed at 1930 hours CST, and was first sighted for two times to be only passing, the disappearance being over the surrounding area of Marshall.

(3) A visual surface observation without optical or electronic equipment.

(4) The object was observed from two to 15 west and 10 northwest, and 15 miles south of Marshall, Texas. By measuring the angle of the object to the ground generally, and estimating the distance to be three miles, this observer placed the altitude of the object to be 3000'. The ground observer saw the object in the east sky, and stated it to be an altitude of 20,000 and 15 miles distant.

(5) [Mostly blacked out]

(6) [Mostly blacked out]

(7) In addition or confirmation, meteorological or other data to have assisted would be wanted for this sighting.

(8) No physical evidence of the sighting exists.

(9) No interception or identification action taken.

(10) Location of the activity in the general area at the time of the sighting is unknown.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2230 houre, CST, 7 September 1952, my wife and I were visiting friends at [redacted]. We were just leav-ing the residence when we noticed an unusual phenomenon in the East sky. A dark orange explosive-like flash appeared and remained visible for approximately three seconds then went out. This explosion appeared to be approximately fifteen miles distance at approximately twenty thousand feet altitude and appeared to be the size of a pea held at arms length.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

SECRET

At 10:30 on the night of September seventh, 1952, my wife and I were sitting outside our house [redacted] when suddenly we saw a cherry-orange colored object appear in the Northwest sky. This object, or light, flashed on in much the same way as a firefly, and seemed to be about the size of a small dirigible. The object was at an angle of 30 degrees from the ground, and by estimating the distance at 3 miles, I placed the object to be at an altitude of 3000 feet. The object remained motionless, and in fifteen or twenty seconds it gradually disappeared.

Its particular color would be equivalent to a Munsell color number of approximately 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. The object was then changed, about twice as long as it was wide, and did not change in size, color, or brightness. Nevertheless, it did not throb, pulsate, nor do any smoke, and there was no sound. To the best of my knowledge this object could not possibly be explained by the mechanics of any conventional aircraft, but it seems to me that it could possibly be due to the ionization of air.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
