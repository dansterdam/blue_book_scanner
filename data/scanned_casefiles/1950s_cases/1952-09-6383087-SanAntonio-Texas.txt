STATEMENT
At approximately 2230 hours, CST, 7 September 1952, my wife and I were visiting friends at [redacted]. We were just leaving the residence when we noticed an unusual phenomenon in the eastern sky. A dark orange explosion-like flash appeared and remained visible for approximately three seconds, then went out. This explosion appeared to be approximately fifteen miles distance at approximately twenty thousand feet altitude and appeared to be the size of a pea held at arm's length.
I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

At 10:39 PM on the night of September Seventh, 1952, we were sitting outside our house observing the night sky. At this time, we observed a strange elongated object hovering in the northern sky. This object, or 13.5 feet, lighted on two ends, glided across the sky at a tremendous speed, and appeared to be about 20 degrees from the horizon.
We observed the object for several minutes, and it appeared to be about 2 miles away, reflecting the strange lights for several minutes. The object then abruptly disappeared, leaving no sound. To the best of our knowledge, this object could not possibly be any known aircraft, but it seems to us that it could possibly be the reflection of a heavenly body or a luminous meteorite. We are reporting this observation to the best of our knowledge.
