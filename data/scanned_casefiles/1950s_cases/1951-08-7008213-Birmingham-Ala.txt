[Name is illegible] and I reside at [address is illegible], Birmingham, Alabama. On the night of 18 August 1951 at a proximately 0430 CST, I observed a beam of light in the western sector of the sky, traveling in an area near N. [rest of location is illegible]. The light would seem to fade and then recur at intervals of approximately 10 to 15 seconds. The light seemed to be a pale yellow color when observed against the glare of the steel mills in the area.

I first observed the light at approximately 0430 CST and estimate that it was visible for approximately even minutes. I reported my observation to Base Operations, 2587th ARTC at the Birmingham Municipal Airport at approximately 0630 CST.
