20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

From the elevation of object it was hard to determine flight pattern. At seemed to make no discernable pattern. Yet remained nearly in the same position. My friend was there and he saw the same thing. It gave two observation what to do. Dashed him sidewards impute.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.
300 feet. in diameter.

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Slowly turned, almost vertical, it paused, there. Its third time it had disappeared and had lost it. Now, looked quite city disappeared or missed.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

I don't guess it's 44. Others metallic. It could be seen easily because of its contour its substance somewhat. You could see it. Seems no pattern. Even could it was a plane. I said no. Seemed to move. Though it appeared. This distance, the second time he looked at it. Then some machine the transmission it on. It paused. By the same second visible. Knew nothing sound of.

[Handwritten notes at top of page with various markings and annotations]

the three planes were commercial type and plane began to circle. Noted that most of the time along at 1500 feet from ground and at 4 V. Third time along with private plane was colored a remarkable cloud last at the private plane was in fog most. But slowly ago and at three planes according to they saw the object as described. That's best to.

P.S. I only speak for myself and what I saw and could understand.

Columbus, Ohio

Dear Sir;

On Saturday, Jan 24, 1959, I was walking in Prospect Park, near the Music Grove, with a old friend. The time was 1215 and the sky was perfectly clear. Two or three planes were flying around. Two commercial and one private, which I noticed later. As was my custom I looked up expectingly nothing.

At a great height I noticed a silver object, metallic, and moving very slowly. leaving no jet traces or streamers. But it was hard to tell which way it was moving. Two of the planes passed underneath it at the time. I looked at my watch it was 1220. Then I called [redacted] to look at it. He took a quick glance, less than a second, and said I was a plane.

I looked again and asked where are it's wings. He looked and walked away. I followed suit but I looked again and said I didn't hear anything. Then I saw the private plane climbing. I looked at it and it seemed to be the same silvery object. It was no plane. It had no wings. It was very high. I would judge 10 miles but this is a guess. I cupped my hands over my eyes to see better. Again I asked [redacted] it was a plane. But he didn't care to stretch his neck as I did. But he saw it. Even for a brief second. I had it in view for over forty seconds, each time I looked at it. As he walked away I followed. But for the third time I looked up and saw not a sign of it. Nor did I hear anything. I have tremendous heights as they went by and I heard their engines or power from where I was, as they went by. But this UFO or possible, didn't show any evidence of being a plane. What was it? It couldn't have been a balloon. Its size was too great. And its habits didn't resemble a free flight object. If any confirmation on this sighting allow me the privilege of knowing what I saw. Don't tell me it was an illusion or trick of nature. My friend saw it though he paid no attention to it. This is his nature not mine. I am more thorough in my application to things around me, above me, below me.

Kindly let me know. Are UFO's still about?

Sincerely
[Signature redacted]

PS I observed a night sighting in 1954 at 9 PM but with no witnesses. (July)
