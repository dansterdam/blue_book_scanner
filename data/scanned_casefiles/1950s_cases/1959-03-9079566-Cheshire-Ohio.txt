The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. It does not contain any photograph, only text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Tape recording submitted by Mr. XXXXXXXX of UFO sighting by XXXXXX on 17 March 1959.

Witness was walking across Tiger Hill when there was a burst of rain. It rained hard, but by the time he got to the top of the hill the rain stopped. Witness saw a strange light about 50' over a house which frightened him. Witness walked on down the road and saw an object about 50' over the road. The object took off like a shot out of a gun and then stopped. Witness was then ordered by a voice to keep back and about buts then the object was gone. The friend dismissed the object as a reflection. Mr. XXXXXX began walking on home; as he walked around a curve, he saw lights of a house, but to his right, about five to ten feet off the ground, he saw a luminous, oblong, object with a cookie-lit-like arrangement on the top which seemed to be rotating. The color of the object was white like the moon. The object then seemed to move toward the ground. This light struck witness' shoulder. There was no sound. The object took off, then slowed down, then went out of sight over a house.

This story was relayed to Mr. XXXXXX by a Mr. XXXXXX who also sighted an object on 16 March 1959, 2030-2100. While driving home from a service call, Mr. XXXXXX noticed his car radio had static. He instinctively looked up for power lines and noticed an object about 300' up and about 75-100' in front of his car. He saw only the bottom of the object. He also noticed that his lights dimmed. He had the object in sight until he reached his home, where he called his family out to see it. By that time it was leaving at such a fast rate of speed no one could tell much about it.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

AFCIN-4446
UFO SIGHTING - 2 DEC 1959
Chesterfield, Ohio

1. Returned herewith is tape recording of your request that the Air Force investigate the sighting of a UFO over your area. We have found that the information contained on the tape was insufficient for us to come to any specific conclusion as to the cause of the sighting. Air Force regulations require that we compromise you and the others who have been inconvenienced by this investigation. In doing so, we ask your understanding that you and the others who have been fully cooperative in this matter be assured that we have done everything possible to arrive at a valid conclusion, and that you have that would assist the Air Force in its investigation of the UFO phenomena.

2. Due to the retirement of Colonel Gilbert, the tape was late in reaching us. The tape was retained here for study and analysis and is being returned along with a copy of this closing summary.

Sincerely,

/s/ D.L. Brennan
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Science and Components
