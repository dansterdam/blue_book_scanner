Dear Sirs:

While looking through some old pictures, I was surprised to enclose a snapshot of an airplane, changing black dots, on it which I have noted. Now trying to know its def. to start more when the picture was taken I took in accidentally. I now think I do know the year around (1947 or 1952). Thank you.

Yours sincerely,

P.S. My address:

SAFIS-3/Maj Tacker/jml/74966

27 February 1958

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your letter of 29 January 1958 concerning unidentified flying objects which you photo-graphed during the period of 1954-1956. The long time interval since the sighting, the lack of supporting information, and the poor quality of the photographs made it most difficult to properly evaluate this sighting.

However, enlargements show the objects appear to be birds on the rise, probably pheasants. Also, the foggy conditions of the sky indicate smoke, possibly from a forest fire or brush fire.

We are returning the original photographs with one enlargement, together with the latest Department of Defense Book about unidentified flying objects, dated 5 November 1957.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer

COMMENTS (Use reverse, if necessary)

1. Enlargements show that objects appear to be birds on the rise, probably pheasants.

2. Bad photography: out of focus, and taken during what appears to be a forest fire or fog.

3. Source should be queried why report of UFO 3 years after it happened.

4. In keeping with USAF policies, returning original and one enlargement to owner.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph with significant graininess and low contrast. There are some circular or oval shapes marked with circles/ovals, and some faint lines or markings across the image. The text is handwritten and somewhat difficult to read clearly.
