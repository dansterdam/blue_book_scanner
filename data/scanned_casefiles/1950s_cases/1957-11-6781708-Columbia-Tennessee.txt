Sir:

On the afternoon of Friday, Nov. 8, some 100 persons reported seeing an unidentified flying object over Columbia and Maury County, Others, who have had experience in sighting aircraft and some who looked at it through binoculars, stated definitely that the object was a high flying jet plane.

But, before we were sure what it was, we checked with the U. S. Air Force filter center nearest here and were told that no jet planes or other objects had been reported to be in operation in this area at that time.

This leaves only one possibility -- that the jet was operating without its flight having been reported to or checked by the U. S. Air Force.

And this might indicate that, perhaps, some other nation was flying jets over the United States without the knowledge of the U. S. Air Force.

Though this is an incomplete and inconclusive observation, it is the only one we can logically draw: that the U. S. Air Force report that the object was not observed by them.

What would your comment be on this hypothesis, that is, that some other nation is flying jet planes or missiles over the United States without your knowledge?

Many persons here are anxiously waiting for your explanation.

Very sincerely yours,

[signature redacted]

SAFTS-3/Maj Tacker/jma/7h966

8 January 1958

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

Your letter of 11 November 1957 concerning an unidentified flying object, addressed to the Commander of the 25th Air Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been referred to this office for reply.

A thorough check reveals this sighting of an unidentified flying object has never been reported to Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson.

Would you please identify the Air Force filter center which received this report and the name of the individual officer or person who received the report?

When we have this information we will check further on this matter.

The suggestion that the sighting may have been a plane or missile from another country is entirely unfounded. There is no evidence to support such a conclusion.

For your information I am enclosing the latest Air Force fact sheet on unidentified flying objects, dated 5 November 1957.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
