AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Selfridge AFB, Michigan

On 27 April 1952, at approximately 2000 hours the undersigned was walking in an
easterly direction toward the officers barracks area at Selfridge Air Force Base,
Michigan, when I noticed in the sky at a 45 degree angle a large flash green light
which trailed to a point to the north. The light was only present in color, persisted
for from three to four seconds, and then disappeared. I heard no noise, saw no
objectâ€”though the light appeared to move in a horizontal plane. It was dark and the
light lit up the sky, being bright enough to throw a reflection in a pool of water
along the road. I cannot determine shape, size, altitude or speed.

Two other officers walking toward me stated, upon my inquiry, that they knew of
a light being then, but thought the light was from a beacon overhead and they ac-
knowledged that this was not the light that must have appeared.

I have been at Selfridge Air Force Base for 16 months, have never seen any simi-
lar lights or balls of green light. The night was clear, stars were clearly visible,
no clouds in the sky. I have seen falling stars, but this light moved horizontally
and not vertically as a falling star.

I would not have reported this ball of light in view of its fragmentary nature,
were it not for the fact that four other sightings, during the daytime, were reported
in areas around Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan.
