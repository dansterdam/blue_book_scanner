7. COURSE: [No text in this field]

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: ASTRONOMICAL: VENUS - VISUAL
    RADAR: FALSE TARGET
    Comments: Was probably Venus which at this time of year at time of sighting is 10 deg above the horizon on an az of approx 270 deg/hrs within close proximity with Venus also.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Bright orange-colored obj which was observed from F-94 a/c at a lower alt diminished in size and color and changed to triangular red and green color. Obj pulled away from a/c at high speed & disappeared. Obj was observation CGI radar scope as being below F-94 a/c.

Okinawa                                                                7 February 1953

I.    Description of Incident

At 2122 local time radar tracked an unidentified object for 15 minutes and alerted a local interceptor squadron. An F-94 scrambled at 2123 hours, climbed to 15,000 ft., picked up nothing on airborne radar but at 2115 did make visual contact with a bright orange colored object which seemed to change to red and green at a special interval. Object was seen by the pilot and the R.C. for approximately 15 minutes after which it disappeared behind a cloud at an azimuth of 290°, low on the horizon.

II.   Discussion of Incident

The weather consisted of scattered stratus clouds. No information is available on atmospheric phenomena such as temperature inversions or moisture-laden clouds with cloud havoc when a spurious radar return. It was determined at the base making the report that the F-94 had sighted the planet Venus which is extremely bright at this time of year and which is located at 273° azimuth from Okinawa and visible that horizon. It is probable that merely by chance ground radar received a spurious plot on its scope and accordingly vectored the F-94 to a position where Venus was very apparent. No strict correlation between the electronics sighting and visual contact can be made.

III.  Conclusion

Probably Venus.
