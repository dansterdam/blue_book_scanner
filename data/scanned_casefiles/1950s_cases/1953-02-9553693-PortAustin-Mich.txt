On 17 February 1953, at 2204 EST, while standing guard, I noticed an unusual light almost due west of our station. The object was in a part of the sky where no stars were visible. The object seemed to glow a bright red, then changed to pale white, and then red again, repeating this change over and over. The movement of this object seemed to be from north to south. After a while the object started getting smaller until I could no longer see it.

At 2204 EST on 17 February 1953, an unidentified light was sighted visually by a 1C John Mandines while on guard duty. I was notified of the sighting and made an observation of it. The object was seen or appeared to hover at approximately 100 feet above the horizon. At the time of the sighting, visibility and ceiling were unlimited. I observed the object which appeared to change from red to pink to white and then red again, for approximately one minute, after which time I returned to operations and attempted to "pick-up" the object on the AN/FPS-3.

At 2208 EST, I "picked-up" the target at GQ 4904 and tracked it for 17 minutes, heading 140 degrees at 55 to 60 knots, at which time, 2225 EST at UP 5249, the target faded into the station ground clutter. Upper beam lobe was the only position I was able to receive a radar return on this object.

Port Austin, Michigan                UNCLASSIFIED                        17 February 1953

I.    Description of Incident

At 2204 EST an unidentified aerial object was sighted visually by members of an NOAA Squadron at Port Austin. The object was eight to ten miles northwest of their station at an estimated 100' above the horizon. It appeared to be larger and brighter than a star and other changing color, there were no unusual features visibly. The object was moving south at a rate of speed and eventually faded out completely after becoming much less bright in intensity. This object was viewed visually from 2204 EST for five minutes until 2209 EST.

At 2208 EST, the observers tracked the object on a search radar set. Position of the object on the radar at this 300° moving in a 160° course at 55 knots. The object was observed at 2203 EST for 17 minutes until 2220 EST. No height finding equipment was available at point of observation, but the observers estimated the altitude at 1000' from the radar returns. Weather conditions at time of sighting were: visibility and ceiling - unlimited, with moderate winds from the west.

II.   Discussion of Incident

The possibility of the reported object being a balloon was checked by the reporting officer. The nearest balloon launch station is at Waukegan, Michigan, which is 140 miles from Port Austin. A piball type balloon was released from Waukegan at 0300Z. It is not likely that this balloon caused the sighting because the object in question was sighted at 0304Z.

Both the visual and electronic sightings were made by the same personnel, consisting of two officers and three airmen. All of these men have three or more years experience in radar. A radar scope camera was installed, but was not in operation at the time of sighting.

No known meteorological disturbances or activity existed at the time of sighting, or at any time that day.

After checking with surrounding bases and flight plan sources, it was found that there were no known aircraft in the general area.

The planet Venus is very low on the northwest horizon at this time of year and is easily seen. This fact might explain the visual sightings, but Venus will not show on a radar scope.

Further analysis of this sighting awaits adiabatic weather charts for the time and area of sighting. Until this information is received, this report is carried as unknown.

INSTRUMENT FLIGHT

For flight subject to Instrument Flight Rules, the pilot and aircraft must be properly rated and equipped, and one of those requirements is that the aircraft must be equipped with properly functioning complete requirements, see Part 36 of the Civil Air Regulations.

V.H.F. IFR FLIGHTS:- Until further notice, Air Traffic Control will be exercised on the assumption that aircraft are conducting IFR flights when flying V.H.F. radio ranges. If a pilot has no contact with the highest altitude center of the route, his flight plan should so indicate. Further, flights should not be conducted on civil airways.

FLIGHT PLAN - Prior to departure from within, or prior to entering a control area or control zone, a complete flight plan and receive an air traffic clearance. Instrument flight plans may be submitted via control communications station known as a Flight Service Station, if no other means are available.

The filling of an instrument flight plan indicates that the pilot is qualified and the aircraft equipped (Parts 20 and 41 of the Civil Air Regulations and, further, that the pilot will conform to all provisions and rules.

Instrument flight plans shall contain the following items:
1. Aircraft identification, and, if necessary, radio call sign;
2. Type of aircraft; or, in the case of a formation flight, the types and number of aircraft involved;
3. Full name, address, and number of pilot certificate of pilot in command of the aircraft, or of the formation flight leader involved.

ALTITUDE REQUIREMENTS:
Aircraft operating in accordance with IFR must be flown at not less than the minimum altitude established for Civil Aeronautics for that portion of the route over which the operation is conducted. In mountainous areas, no flight may be conducted at an altitude less than the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of 5 miles from the center of the course intended to be flown, except for those areas designated as mountainous areas. In such areas, minimum altitude may be determined by reference to U.S. Geological Survey Radio Facility Charts. "At least 500 feet on top" (5/OTP) may be filled by pilots in their flight plans under certain conditions.

Pilots proposing flight along controlled civil airways should indicate in the flight plan the seven or eight digit number above sea level depending upon a direction of flight as indicated on Coast and Geodetic Survey Facility Charts.

STANDARD AIRCRAFT HOLDING PATTERNS
The standard holding flight path of an aircraft is to follow the specified course inbound to the holding fix at a rate three degrees per second; to turn to the right, fly a parallel straight course outbound from the holding fix for one minute; make another 180 degree turn to the right and again follow the specified course inbound. Due to congested areas, terrain and other factors, non-standard holding flight paths are utilized at some locations.

Non-standard holding flight paths are depicted on supplemental sheets accompanying Coast and Facility Charts.

AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONES

In the United States several areas have been designated as Air Defense Identification Zones by the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics in the interest of national security. All aircraft entering the Air Defense Identification Zones are required to file flight plans, except aircraft entering from within the Continental United States within the Northwest, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, and Knoxville Zones, at altitudes above the immediate terrain. Effective January 15, 1951, are new Civil Air Regulations which provide penalties of one year in prison or $1,000 fine.

The Air Defense Identification Zones are identified as ADIZ, San Francisco ADIZ, Los Angeles ADIZ, D12, Atlantic ADIZ, Pacific ADIZ, Albuquerque ADIZ, Canadian Boundary ADIZ. These areas are indicated on the face of Aeronautical Charts and are so labeled.

Canadian Air Defense Identification Zones (CADIZ) have been designated by the Director of Air Transport. All aircraft entering these zones at altitudes of 4000 feet or more above the immediate file flight plans. The Canadian Air Defense Identification Zones in the Eastern CADIZ are identified. They are also indicated on the face of aeronautical charts and are so labeled.

754th AC&W Squadron, Port Austin

1. At 220L EST, 17 February 1953, an unidentified object was sighted visually by A 1C John Mandines and 2nd Lt Harold S Eagle. The object changed color from red to pink to pale white to white and back to red again. The object appeared to be larger and brighter than a star, and other than changing color there were no unusual features visible. The object appeared to be moving south at a very slow rate of speed. Eventually it faded out completely after becoming smaller and much less bright in intensity. At 2208 EST, 17 February 1953, 2nd Lt Eagle detected an unidentified target on the search radar equipment. The target was moving on a course of 180 degrees at 55 knots. It did not have any unusual characteristics and was lost for an aircraft.

2. Object was first sighted at 2204 EST, visually for 5 minutes until 2209 EST, 17 February 1953. Detection time on radar was 2208 EST for 17 minutes until 2224 EST, 17 February 1953.

3. Object observed visually from ground and electronically by Search Radar. Type of radar was upper beam (1297 megacycles) of AN/FPS-3.

4. Observers who sighted object were at 754th AC&W Squadron, Port Austin, Michigan; longitude 83 degrees west, latitude 44 degrees 02 minutes 22 seconds north; elevation 646.75 feet MSL. Radar equipment located at same position. Object was sighted visually approximately 8 to 10 miles west northwest of station, estimated 100 feet above horizon. Location of radar track was 9 miles at 300 degrees. Grid coordinates of station are HQ 0213 and target was at CQ 1904. No height finder available to estimate altitude of target using calibration data showed target to be at approximately 1,000 feet.

5.

The object changed in color from red to pink to pale white to white and back to red again. The object appeared to be larger and brighter than a star, and other than changing color there were no unusual features visible. The object appeared to be moving south at a very slow rate of speed. Eventually it faded out completely after becoming smaller and much dimmer. At 2208 EST, 17 February 1953, 2nd Lt Eagle detected an unidentified target on the search radar equipment. The target was moving on a course of 180 degrees at 55 knots. It did not have any unusual characteristics except the speed, which was slow.

2. Object was first sighted at 2204 EST, visually for 5 minutes until 2209 EST, 17 February 1953. Detection time on radar was 2208 EST for 17 minutes until 2225 EST, 17 February 1953.
