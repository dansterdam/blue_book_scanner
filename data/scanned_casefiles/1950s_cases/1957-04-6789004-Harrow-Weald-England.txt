THE COMET THAT WAS TO PASS BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN. 
NOT KNOWING WHERE THE COMET COULD BE LOCATED WE WERE 
SEARCHING THE ENTIRE SKY, OBJECT FIRST OBSERVED 
APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES ELEVATION FROM HORIZON IN THE SSZ. 
OBJECT MOVED APPROXIMATELY 35 DEGREES ELEVATION FROM 
NNE IN THE NE. D. DESCRIPTION OF FLIGHT PATH OF OBJECT 
WAS SIGHTED IN A STRAIGHT LINE, JUST OVER THE TOP OF JUPITER, 
RELATIVE TO EARTH AND LINE OF SIGHT. AFTER PASSING JUPITER
THE OBJECT BEGAN MANEUVERING AT SHARP 25 DEGREE ANGLES, FIRST 
MAKING A 45 DEGREES ANGLE CONTINUING A LEVEL FLIGHT IN A 
DIRECTION. CHANGES IN DIRECTION WERE SHARP AND DEFINITE,
OCCURRING ONLY CHANGE IN COLOUR FROM THE NORMAL RED TO A 
FLIGHT ORANGE. ONLY AT THE APEX OF EACH ANGLE. CHANGE OF COLOUR 
WAS ONLY A MOMENTARY CHANGE EXACTLY AT THE POINT OF THE ANGLE
OF THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION AND IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO RED.
THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW BY DIMINISHING IN SIZE DUE TO
TRAVELLING AWAY FROM WEST. LENGTH OF TIME IN SIGHT WAS 
APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 6 SECONDS. MANNER OF OBSERVATION:
A. GROUND-VISUAL. B. OPTICAL AIDS-NEGATIVE. A. TIME

NO WINGS AND TAIL AND NO SOUND WAS EMITTED FROM OBJECT. THEREFORE IT WOULD NOT BE A KNOWN AIRCRAFT. C. OBJECT TRAVELED TO FAST TO BE A BALLON. D.

Reference TIMSG, UFO Report INB-2-7D-1170, dated 26 Apr 57
regarding sighting over Harrow-Weald, England. Data submitted
insufficient upon which to base firm conclusions or make sound
scientific analysis. However, description of maneuvers of object
characteristic of aircraft at high altitudes (allowing for known
inability or difficulty of laymen to properly describe moving
objects against night sky), typical of hundreds received during the
ten-year existence of UFO Project, and later found to be aircraft.

Comments of preparing officer, ruling out aircraft because no
sound heard or additional lights observed, not considered valid,
Repeatedly proven that aircraft, singly or in large formations at
high altitudes can manifest themselves day or night without being
heard. During day, aircraft at high altitudes can be observed
