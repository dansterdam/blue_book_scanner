HORIZON IN THE NW. D. DESCRIPTION OF FLIGHT PATRY OBJECT
IN SIGHTED IN A STRAIGHT LINE, JUST OVER THE TOP OF JUPITER,
RELATIVE TO EARTH AND LINE OF SIGHT. AFTER PASSING JUPITER
THE OBJECT WENT NW. ASCENDING AT SHARP 45 DEGREE ANGLE, FIRST
CHANGING A 45 DEGREE ANGLE CONTINUING A LEVEL FLIGHT IN A
DIRECTION. CHANGES IN DIRECTION NNW. SHARP AND DEFINITE
ACCOMPANIED BY A CHANGE IN COLOR FROM THE NORMAL RED TO A
BRIGHT ORANGE. ONLY AT THE APEX OF EACH ANGLE. CHANGE OF COLOR
WAS ONLY A MOMENTARY CHANGE EXACTLY AT THE POINT OF THE ANGLE
OF THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION AND IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO RED.

4. SOME PASSING EARTH WAS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF COURSE, THEEFORE OBJECT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE COMET.

5. THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL LIGHTS/VS CARRIED BY AIRCRAFT.

6. WINGS AND TAIL AND NO SOUND WAS EMITTED FROM OBJECT, THEREFORE IT COULD NOT BE A KNOWN AIRCRAFT. 7. OBJECT COULD NOT BE A GROUND LIGHT BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE IT TRAVELED AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE SKY TO REFLECT GROUND LIGHTS. 8. OBJECT WAS NOT A METEOR DUE TO ERRATIC COURSE TRAVELED.

Reference TMSG, UFO Report INB-2-TD-1170, dated 26 Apr 57

Regarding sighting over Harrow-Weald, England. Data submitted insufficient upon which to base firm conclusions or make sound scientific analysis. However, description of maneuvers of object characteristic of aircraft at high altitudes (allowing for known inability or difficulty of laymen to properly describe moving objects against night sky), typical of hundreds received during the ten-year existence of UFO Project, and later found to be aircraft.

Comments of preparing officer, ruling out aircraft because no sound-heard or additional lights observed, not considered valid.

Repeatedly proven that aircraft, singly or in large formations at high altitudes can manifest themselves day or night without being heard. During day, formations at high altitudes can be observed

How or reflected lights directly through contrails without sound. At night jet aircraft can be seen for great distances through jet exhaust flame, which may be observed having varying color hues, due to atmospheric and other conditions. Navigational and other lights generally will not be observed if jet at high altitudes.
