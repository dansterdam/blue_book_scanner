7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
3-4 mins

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

9. COURSE
PNE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Elliptical obj, size of large grapefruit, length approx 2 times as long, white to yellow light. Moved on water. Steady slow course fm over water toward land. Disappeared proof, however over land, two rpts, same time succeeding days. Different observers.

11. COMMENTS
Astro plot & computer indicate the star Vega was practically in position given by observers. At point of initial observation, Venus was exceptionally bright, however location near 60 deg & lower. Investigators considered possible arc sighting. Insufficient data, terminal point of observation not included. Duration too short for Astro sighting at this elev.

Dear Captain:

I now have had a chance to look through all the reports you sent, and the one concerning the "satellite-type sighting" for Denver interests me very much and I am giving it my immediate comment. It is clear that this could not have been any of the American satellites, not only because of the excessive brightness, but because no American satellite at present could be seen approaching from the northwest at the latitude of Denver, on April 30th there were no known Russian Sputniks up, but even had there been it is almost inconceivable that objects that bright would escape observation by our Moonwatch teams.

This is a corker, so much so, that with I had the time and the opportunity to talk with these two officers, it could be that in casual conversation some clue might be obtained which is not apparent in their records.

I had an experience the other night which may bear on this. I had been instructing my young daughter in "learning sidereal time, and we had gone out on the lawn to check our calculations when there came along a sputnik-like object - correct brightness, correct speed, correct color, and I almost would swear it was a satellite. Then another such object came through in another direction, and then a few minutes still another. On the third one I was able to detect over another jet motors. If the other object had not gone through I might honestly be puzzled to this day as to whether I had seen an unknown satellite. I didn't know then whether jets ever carried such lights.

It is almost inconceivable two such experienced officers could have made the mistake I had first made, but strange things do happen. In the meantime, I am having this observation checked against all other "unknown sputniks" that our teams from time to time have reported.

As to the other cases, which I am returning (I will return the Denver case very soon), I certainly am not having a fire upon the case observatory case - five of them. Two others remain: one the object that was seen the same time on two nights just before sunrise.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(period of morning twilight had already begun). Vega was, as you say, near the point of seeing big it seems to me that it was somewhat higher than 60Â°. There was a very particular object in the sky at that time out, unfortunately, in the southeastern sky. The planet Venus was at its brightest in the pre-sunrise sky, and I know from past experience how easily it can be mistaken for an unknown object. My only reason to question the stated position and to consider the possibility that I was wrong.

The case of the "daylight meteor" is greatly ambiguous. While a daylight fireball cannot be ruled out, I would myself favor the accidental release of some object from an aircraft. However, much hinges on the statement "orange flame". If it really was flaming then it looks as though me must credit this to a daylight meteor. If the light was a simply bright revelation of sunlight, then we have the other possibility. In either case, there is nothing hostile, and I say to this "insufficient information to be able to distinguish whether this object or meteor or aircraft". I don't think it is worthwhile to pursue this one, might be made. It just occurs to me that perhaps the object might have been a burst weather or cosmic ray balloon, with the result that from the trailing material according for the "tall four times the diameter of object". In fact, I think this is a distinct possibility since it occurred in the neighborhood of the principal observation from which, I suppose, balloons are launched. The time of the report was about 10:30 a.m., which is about the time of such launchings. So, three possibilities, I believe, are now tend to prefer the latter. All harmless but, I

I am looking forward to visiting you in your new quarters---
I hope in early June.
