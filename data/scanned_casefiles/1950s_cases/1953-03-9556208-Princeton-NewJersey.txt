Trenton, New Jersey

1. The Air Technical Intelligence Center recently received your report of an unidentified aerial object seen by 1st Personnel at 1/50, 1 March 1953. It wishes to commend the prompt action taken by 1/Lt Richard F. Watson and A/2C Raymond J. Swallow, Jr., in doing the scene of the sighting and identifying the unknown object as the planet Venus, thereby saving the ATIC considerable cost and effort is determining the object's identity.

2. It is hoped that more personnel responsible for reporting unidentified sightings Air Force-wide will show equal initiative and enthusiasm in determining the nature of many so-called "flying saucers" reports.

3. The Air Technical Intelligence Center has received about twenty reports from the East Coast in the past month which have been analyzed as being the planet Venus. Therefore, your report and conclusion falls in the same trend.
