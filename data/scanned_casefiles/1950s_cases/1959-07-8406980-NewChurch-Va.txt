varied

erratic

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Circular lights w/edges fuzzy or blurred. No impression of solidity. Followed a crescent pattern w/tips pointing up. Speed varied but never abrupt. Lights appeared to dance each other, somewhat in a game of tag. Occasionally one light would catch another & mesh with it. Movement was North to South.

11. COMMENTS
HK given as hot & somewhat hazy with few stars. This could account for the appearance & disappearance of the objects. Well, no definite conclusion. Inversion was present which would aid to the distortion of the lights. Duration not given. Possibly could be that the lights were several were from a refueling operation. Better sent to the principle witnesses than an answer, as considered a poor refueling rather than insufficient data.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft Refuel Opn
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical

Gentlemen:

I am not sure to whom I should address this letter, or, in fact, whether I should even send it. I am embarrassed by the probability that the phenomenon I report is already known to you, and that it can more than likely be readily explained.

At any rate, I write to report the observation at length of strange lights in the sky over the New Church, Virginia area of the Delmarva Peninsula on the night of Wednesday, July 1.

I did not personally see these lights and have no first hand knowledge of them whatever. The information enclosed herein comes solely from a level-headed housekeeper, our bookkeeper here at WDVM, Mrs. [redacted] of New Church, Va. I took notes on her description of the lights, wrote them up as they are here, and gave them to her for approval as to accuracy.

I repeat that I am embarrassed to send you this story because I am sure you have a simple explanation for the appearance of these lights. However, I understand that you are processing data of the sort and felt compelled to let you have it for what it's worth.

Assuming that there is some simple explanation for the phenomenon, would you please advise us?

Very truly yours,
Program Director

Location:

Lights seen from New Church, Virginia, facing West.

Observer extremely reluctant to estimate height due to having no experience in such or related matters. Says could be any height from a few hundred feet on up. But does say that some of neighbors who saw lights chased them in automobiles which indicates some of the observers thought them to be quite low.

Crescent-shaped pattern of light movement ran North-South at right-angles to observer, tips of crescent pointing up.

8:50 PM, EST to approx. 9:30 PM ... Wednesday, July 1, 1959

Weather Conditions: hot, humid, somewhat hazy, few if any stars, brisk breeze, not too dark.

General appearance of lights or objects: definitely circular in appearance, although during their fastest movement, they appeared to have a tail. Observer readily admits,however, that this could easily be due to a blurring effect caused by rapid acceleration and greater speed.

Color: off-white as, perhaps, the moon in half-stage as seen behind thin, hazy clouds. No specific color tone, but definitely not snow-white. Edges not clearly defined, but definitely circular.

No impression of object being spherical, but cannot be positive that it wasn't three-dimensional. No impression of solidity, but cannot be positive that it was not solid.

First impression and description: Thought it (they) was some sort of light being projected into the sky as if by spot light, beacon, or movie projector...although discounted this because:

1. lights were too high.
2. moved too fast.
3. disappeared suddenly to reappear in different location, and,
4. very definitely did not show beam as from projector at any time.

MOVEMENT:
Followed crescent pattern...tips of crescent pointing up. Lights appeared whole at right tip, moved at varying speeds to disappear at left tip. Pattern invariable...speed varied from very fast to slow, but movement never completely stopped. When multiple lights were seen, one would sometimes appear to chase another, resembling a game of tag. Occasionally one light would catch another and disappear behind it or mesh with it.
