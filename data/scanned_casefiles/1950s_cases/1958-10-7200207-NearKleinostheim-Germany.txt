My Opinion
do Regards to the description given by my
cousin. It could be an object which my
cousin saw 45 minutes after sunset, more
toward the earth and was illuminated by the
suns rays. As the object fell into the
earth shadow it was no longer visible to
my cousin. Therefore it probably never
was seen in countries west of Germany,
especially in north + south America because
there it would still have been daylight.
the object came in the direction of my cousin
because it grew large and must have
approached the ground (or water) along an
approximate line that runs from Aschaffenburg
over the eastern Mediterranean sea towards
Australia. Because the object was seen
a short time after the moon-
rocket "Pioneer" was launched it could
possibly be the "Pioneer" returning to earth.
My cousin positively says that the object was
not a shooting star. As a chief signal-man
for the railroad for many years he was very
often on night duty in the signal tower which
must have many large windows through
which one can see the night time heaven
very well. He tells me that in his life-time
he has seen close to 100 shooting stars,


- page 10 -

Here is the text from the document:

Which have all flown faster, were yellow (darker) in color and brighter/blatter than the object obtained on 13 oct. 1958. Also the shooting stars did not grow in size during their flight. My Cousin and I would be very happy should this message with the endeavour of the 1958 Geophysical year, which all countries and peoples of the earth are supporting. The wish, accomplished result of its purpose is to give to the world a picture of the backside of the moon. Should these notice in conjunction with others from countries eastward of Germany disclose information of the "Pioneer" return to earth, then the purpose of this message will be fulfilled. My cousin and I are interested. Messages were received by you from other distant countries that mentioned other phenomena (1840 hrs central european time) which gave usable coordinates. Perhaps you will give us an answer about this.

Yours respectfully,
[signature area blacked out]

On Monday, October 13, 1958, approximately at 6:40 PM Central European Time, my cousin watched a phenomenon in the sky southeast of Kleinostheim near Aschaffenburg. Although I was with him, I did not see the appearance. Perhaps it was a shooting star. Since the "Pioneer" moon rocket dropped back to earth about that time, perhaps this phenomenon in the sky was the "Pioneer." If you are interested in my cousin's observations, please list the questions you are interested in especially, for example, time and place of the observation, direction in the sky, direction of the movement in the sky, form and color of the phenomenon, etc.

Yours truly,

Dear Dr.

The unidentified flying object viewed by your cousin on 13 October 1958 was not "Pioneer" as it returned six hours after this sighting.

The object viewed was probably a meteor or bolide of short duration.

Oktober 1958, circa 18.40 Uhr (abends) MEZ von Kleinostheim (bei Aschaffenburg) aus gegen Südosten ein Phänomen am Himmel (shooting-star?). Da um jene Zeit die Mondsrakete "Pioneer" zur Ende niedrig ing. Könnte es sich bei diesem Himmelphänomen um den "Pioneer" gehandelt haben. Sollte das Raketenlaboratorium Interesse haben an der Beobachtung meines Vetters, so bitte ich darum, mir das mitzuteilen und die Fragen im einzelnen anzugeben, für deren Beantwortung sich das Laboratorium interessiert (wie z.
