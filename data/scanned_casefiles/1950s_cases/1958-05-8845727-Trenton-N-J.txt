A1. Technical Intelligence Center, Wri,Patt-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

AFCIN-4X25 The Inspector General, USAF, 5th District Office of Special Invest-
            igations, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

AFCIN-4X2 1. A review of subject photographs and attendant report has been
            made by this Center.

AFCIN-4X3 2. This Center does not concur with source's statement that the
            white spot photographed over the face of the moon is not the result
            of faulty equipment or poor developing materials. Examinations, in-
            volving both microscopic studies and photographic enlargements, indi-
            cate that the spot is a defect. Technically, it is the conclusion of
            this Center that the spot was caused by grain crystallization of the
            photographic emulsion on the film. These grains clump together and fuse
            during the development process. This is a common occurrence that in
            general appears in about one out of fifty photographs developed.

AFCIN-4 3. A review by a scientist and a professional astronomer who spent
            many years with the Harvard Observatory confirms this. This scientist
            has examined over 25,000 photographic plates and has noted many such
            defects.

AFCIN-4B 4. Our investigators disclose that from official observatories
            and related agencies which were observing the moon at that specific
            time (2330 - 2400) as alleged, no reports were received of
            any object transversing the face of the moon.

AFCIN-4C 5. The fact that source, by his own admission, states that this
            was his first attempt at astro-photography, that he is unemployed, and
AFCIN-4D    that he saw fit to submit this photograph to Life's magazine (apparently
            for sale), is considered significant and undoubtedly provides a clue
            to the real motive behind the matter.

AFCIN-4E 6. Par. 196, AFR 200-2, dtd. 8 February 1958, specifically
            directs that all original and related material be re-
            turned to the owner. ..tracned here is the original 35mm negative and
            one enlargement, is directed for return to the owner.

AFCIN-4F 7. Inclosure, other than the original 35MM negative, have been
            withdrawn for entry into official UFO case files.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was initiated pursuant to request of District Commander, OSI District Office #3, File 24-203, dated 6 June 1958, subsequent to information supplied by Mr. JAMES A. REEDER, Chief, 2d U.S. Army Industrial Security Office, 510 Princeton Avenue, Philadelphia 35, Pennsylvania. REEDER related that he had received a telephone call from MARTIN J. BAILEY, Superintendent, Plant Protection Department, U.S. Steel, Fairless Works, Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania.

According to REEDER, BAILEY stated that a former employee, photographer taken of the moon on 29 May 1958 in Trenton, New Jersey, had produced a photograph which was a small white unidentifiable speck. According to BAILEY, [redacted] is an expert photographer, presently doing research for Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey. He maintained that this white speck, approximately the size of a pin-head, is not the result of faulty equipment or poor developing materials.

AT PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY

2. On 16 June 1958, the writer interviewed Mr. JAMES HENRY, Assistant Personnel Director, Stanhope Hall, Princeton, New Jersey, who advised that [redacted] had made application for work at Princeton University but was not as yet hired. HENRY further stated that he was himself an amateur astronomer and had therefore asked for a copy of his photograph, which he (HENRY) then forwarded for purposes of inspection to Dr. [redacted], Director, Project Markhorn, Forrestal Research Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey.

3. On 16 June 1958, [redacted] was interviewed by the writer. He stated he had seen a copy of the photograph in question which he considered to be "interesting". He added, however, that in the field of astronomy no opinions of a photograph could be made on a single exposure. SPITZER stated that in his opinion no significance could be paid a situation such as this without corroboration from several further photographs taken at different times.

AT TRENTON, NEW JERSEY

4. On 16 June 1958, [redacted] was interviewed at his home, 944 S. Olden Avenue. He stated that the photograph was taken as one of a series of exposures on the night of 29 May 1958 between the hours of 2330 and 2400. He indicated he had been a "free-lance" photographer since 1937. He indicated the following information regarding himself:

There is very little text on this page. In the top right corner, there appears to be some handwritten text that looks like "1# ok g" but it is somewhat illegible due to the image quality.

The page contains a black and white image of a circle/partial circle within a square frame, with some horizontal lines at the bottom of the frame. The image appears to be a document or diagram from a UFO report, but the specific details of the image are not clear from this scan.
