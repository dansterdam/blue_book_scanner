The New Jersey UFO Sighting
Trenton, N.J. 
8 May 1958
At 2200 hours, the witness, a civilian employee of the United States Air Force, observed an unidentified flying object approximately 20-30 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The object was circular in shape and emitted a yellowish-white glow. It remained stationary for several minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. The witness reported this sighting to the nearest Air Force base.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR system and output the text found in the document:

On March 12, 1958, at about 8:00 PM, I was out in my backyard in Trenton, N.J. looking up at the sky. I observed an object that appeared to be approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter and about 15 to 20 feet thick. The object was whitish in color and had a reddish light on the bottom. It was moving at a slow speed and seemed to be under intelligent control. The object hovered for a few minutes and then shot off at a very high speed to the northeast.

1. Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio - The Inspector General, USAF, The Director of Special Investigations, Headquarter, USAF, and Commanding General, Air Force Base, Ohio
2. This review of subject photographs and attendant report has been made by this Center.
3. A review by a scientist and a professional astronomer who spent many years with the Harvard Observatory astronomers states: "This negative has examined over 25,000 photographic plates and has noted many such spots."
4. Our investigators disclose that from official observatories side glass saucers which were observed did not exceed on that specific size (22.00 - 24.00) as alleged by source. No reports were received of the moon.
5. The fact that sources, by his own admission, states that this was the first time he attempted astrophotography that he is unemployed, and that he saw fit to submit this photograph to LD magazine (apparently only after his confidence had been sufficiently aroused) provides a clue to the real motive behind the matter.
6. INSTRUCTIONS: Insofar as the original 3-1/4 by 4-1/4 photographs and related material be returned to the owner, it is therefore recommended that they be enlarged as in the original 8 by 10 suggestive of the enlargements to be therefore for return to the owner.

The text indicates that the photograph was taken on 25 May 1959 on which there was a "small white unidentifiable speck". The text also mentions that this was an "expert photographer" doing research for Princeton University, and that the size of the object in the photograph, which is approximately the size of a pinhead, is not the result of faulty equipment or poor photographic techniques.

DETAILS:
1. This investigation was initiated pursuant to request of
District Commander, OSI District Office #31, File 2D-203, dated 6 June
1959, subsequent to information supplied by MT. JAMES A. RENDER,
Chief, 2d U.S. Army Industrial Security Office, 5100 Princeton Avenue,
Philadelphia 31, Pennsylvania. RENDER stated that he had received a
photograph from JAMES A. FAIRLESS, formerly an employee, Bethlehem Steel
Department, U.S. Steel, Fair-less Works, Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania.
According to RENDER, FAIRLESS, a former employee, Trenton, New Jersey, had produced a
photograph taken of the moon on 25 MAY 1959 on which there was a small
white unidentifiable speck. According to HALEY, an expert
photographer, previously doing research for Princeton University, stated that this white spot,
approximately the size of a pin-head, is not the result of faulty
equipment or poor developing techniques.

2. On 16 June 1959, the writer interviewed Mr. JAMES HENRY, Assistant
tant Director, Princeton University Observatory, New Jersey, who
advised that the had made application for work at Princeton University but was
turned down, but further stated that he was himself an amateur astronomer and had therefore asked
copy of his photograph, which he then forwarded for purposes of carrying out identificational details, Forrestal Research Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey.

3. On 16 June 1959, the writer was interviewed by the writer. He
stated he had seen a copy of the photograph in question which he con-
sidered to be of no astronomical significance and which he said astronomy no opinions of a photograph could be made as a single evidence. SINGER stated that in his opinion no significance could
be paid a situation such as this without corroboration from several
further photographs taken at different times.

AT TRENTON, NEW JERSEY
4. On 16 June 1959, a Mr. was interviewed by the writer at his
home, 524 S. Olden Avenue. He stated that his photograph was taken as
