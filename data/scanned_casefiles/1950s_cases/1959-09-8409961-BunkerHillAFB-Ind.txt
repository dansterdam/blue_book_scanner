It appears 1955- 18 Sep 5-9 flight oak harbor at Bunker Hill AFB called requesting information as to what only was normally responsible for investigating UFOs and preparing the reports. He was informed that normally the base intelligence section performed this function, but all bases did not have an intel section. He was also informed that the base commander was responsible for the investigation and subsequent disposition. However, the Comm. delegated this function to whatever organization he so desired.

1st writer also discussed the sporting format of AFR 200-2. He felt that the format was not sufficient to guidance and offered to submit some suggestions of his own. He was told that we would be glad to receive suggestions for review.

1st writer was questioned on a few points of the UFO report submitted by his org. He stated that the object was reported to have been seen at 1000, and that it was stationary until 1200.
