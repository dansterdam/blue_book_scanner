DATE 15 October 1953

I first noticed the object at 2235 hours on 13 Oct 53.
It appeared to be approximately six miles north of the
Control Tower. The light appeared to be suspended and
circular in shape, then the light appeared to cast off a
light and general colors and return to the stationary
suspense light. Then at times the light appeared to drop
directly to the ground, this happened several times during
the night.

This object never appeared to have wings or give
off exhaust or vapor trails.
