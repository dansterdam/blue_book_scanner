NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Redacted]
DATE: 15 October 1953

I first noticed the object at 0235 hours the 19 Oct 53. It appeared to be approximately six miles north of the Central town. The light appeared to be suspended low circular in shape, when the light appeared to set off on flight and passed west and return to the stationary position light. Then at times the light appeared to drop directly to the ground, this happened several times during the night.

The object never appeared to have wings or give off colored or engine trails.
