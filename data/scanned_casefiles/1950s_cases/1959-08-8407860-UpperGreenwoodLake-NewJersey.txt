Air Force
To whom it may concern -
Around midnight, Aug 11-1959 I was laying in bed and looking
thru the window. I saw what I thought was a large star.
Imagine my surprise when all of a sudden my star took off
towards the horizon to the east.
It was south east when I first saw it. I hopped out of bed
and watched it disappear. I remember thinking at the time,
I never saw a plane move so fast. I told a few skeptic people
who laughed at it. This was the week end, I forgot it -- but yesterday
a teen age boy came to ask about it.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document describing a sighting of a group of "teen-agers" who witnessed an object that "wasn't a plane." The document mentions that the object had white lights and a red light. It also states that the witness did not see any effects on life here, but they have a "uranium mine a few miles away."

The text in the document is as follows:

"The stars I saw. We were with a group of teen-agers at a beach party and they saw an object that wasn't a plane. He said what they saw had red on the tips. The one I saw had only white lights. It was as high, maybe the red was blocked out.

He flunked me and no one even saw any effects life here, till they put in the Mike-bases - and we also have a uranium mine a few miles away.

We're up in the mountains here and I always feel safe when I hear a jet over 24,000. It had none of these things they looked at with the binoculars when they first came."

like to know about them. 
Sometimes at night, my TV
acts up with strange interferences.
I used to think it might be a
short wave set in the vicinity.
I don't know if this information
is any use or not. Probably
would have dismissed it, if
the boy hadnt come in to
tell me what he had seen.
I had told his grandmother
the week before. Both occur-
ences were on Tues nights.
Mine Aug 11 -- Hers Aug 15.
Both times the object came
from the same direction.
Sincerely,
Mrs. ****** (cover)

The image appears to be a handwritten document, but there is no photograph present. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

As we were sitting this morning, this youngster came over and said - 
I told her about my star. She views across the lake facing 
the mountain. She said she saw what she thought was 
a star two - it moved to the East in intervals. When she
told her husband, he laughed so she didn't tell anyone else. 
I mentioned it. She saw it a month or so ago. Whatever
it is, it always came out of the south east and moves
to the east.

OFFICER: 116, NEW YORK ADS., MCGUIRE AFB, NJ. A CHECK OF AIC FORCE BASES IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING INDICATED THAT NO WEATHER BALLOONS HAD BEEN RELEASED IN THE AREA AND TIME UNDER QUESTION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE WINDS WERE FROM 220 TO 319 DEGREES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A BALLOON FROM SOME OTHER BASE TO THE WEST OF THE SITE LOCATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE.
