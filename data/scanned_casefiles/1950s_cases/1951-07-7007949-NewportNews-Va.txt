2. Cpl. [redacted] RA and Pfc. [redacted] ER, 110th T Harborcraft Company, this station, reported that they sighted an unidentified spherical lighted object at 2305 hours, 4 July 1951, from a park located near the Greyhound Bus Station, Newport News, Virginia.

3. According to informants, the object appeared in the northwestern portion of the sky at approximately a 45 to 50 degree angle and remained lit with a gaseous glow until approximately 2330 hours, when the lighted phenomenon disappeared toward the northwestern horizon. Both informants stated the object appeared to suddenly black out and plunge earthward.

4. A local check of both informants reveal that they are considered truthful, reliable and intelligent soldiers. No motive could be discovered for the reporting of the above incident other than in compliance with current directives regarding unidentified aerial objects.

5. If an interview is desired for further information, the enlisted men may be interviewed at Headquarters, 110th T Harborcraft Company, this station.
