HSCG, Hq 4602d AIS, 20 Nov 56, Subj: UFOB Report
1st Ind

Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio     5 DEC 1955

TO: Commander, Headquarters, 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron
(AIC), Edt Air Force Base, Colorado

1. This Center is in receipt of an FBI report dated 12 June
1956, submitted through the Office of Special Investigations, re-
garding a UFO sighting observed by a Sgt Richardson over Kennewick,
Washington in 1955, copy attached.

2. Based on the limited data submitted an evaluation of the
report, plus a general check of activities of the area in question,
resulted in the following:

A. The UFO sighting was reported one year after the inci-
dent took place, making it impossible for an immediate and on-the-
spot investigation.

B. It appears odd that an object as large as described,
and appearing at low altitude over a fairly large town during a
summer night, was not observed or reported by others.

C. Yakima, Washington, which is approximately 75 miles
northwest of Kennewick, has an established U.S. weather bureau
balloon-launching station. Balloons are launched every six hours.

D. There are approximately nine to ten military airdromes
and airfields in the vicinity of and between Yakima and Kennewick
all, normally, launching scheduled or unscheduled balloons.

E. Radiosonde balloons launched at night from military
airfields are from seven to twenty feet in diameter. They carry a
white running light underneath which, generally, give a metallic
sheen when reflecting on the surface of the balloon.

F. The general wind direction on the night of the sighting
was east-southeast. Our experience has shown that such pickup
and radiosonde balloons rise between 600 to 1200 feet per second
many, due to either breakage of wind conditions, will remain at a
low altitude, zigzag or stop, before rising again or dropping.

G. It is apparent that Sgt Richardson is a "flying saucer
enthusiast." His statement that he has been "interested in flying
saucers for years and has 'read everything'" on the subject confirm
this.

3. In light of the above, our conclusions strongly suggest that the object observed was a balloon.

4. Reference paragraph 3 of your basic correspondence. From a review of all material on file regarding subject observer, it appears that he not only has a highly-active imagination and an apparently strong belief in so-called "flying saucers," but that he will continue making a nuisance of himself to the FBI and other USAF units. It is therefore advised that Sgt Richardson be informed, in substance, of the following:

a. That he should report all UFO sightings to the nearest USAF unit, preferably a 4602d AISS unit, and not the FBI.

b. That the Air Force is in receipt of his report of the Kennewick sighting; the information is being used as part of the continuing program for the study and analysis of unidentified aerial objects, and that his interest in the matter is appreciated.

c. Further, he should be informed in a rather firm manner that as an officer of the law he is certainly aware that unless any incident is reported immediately it is of limited value for investigation.

d. If desired, items under paragraph 3a through 3c above be made part of the correspondence.

e. A standard USAF UFO questionnaire together with Form 64 A, "UFO Observers Instruction Sheet," be sent to Sgt Richardson with a request that although late for proper processing, the data be desirable for completeness of file. A personal interview by some member of your field unit would be desirable in that it will accord an opportunity to study or make some observation of the type of personality involved.

Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Dear Sir:

The following information was furnished to Special Agent Clement W. Parkhurst, resident agent, Richland, Washington on June 1, 1956:

Sergeant Gordon Richardson, Kennewick, Washington Police Department, advised that for several years he has been very interested in flying saucers and has read everything available concerning this topic. Gordon advised that he has some information which he considers to be of utmost importance to the defense of the United States concerning a flying space ship which he observed over Kennewick, Washington about a year ago. Richardson stated that he had never told anyone about this matter and had not discussed it with other officials of the police department because they "never pay any attention to what he says". Gordon prefaced his remarks by stating that he realizes his information sounds like a "nut complaint" but assures the writer that his is not so.

Richardson stated that the thing he saw has been weighing very heavily on his mind and he believes this information should be passed on to the Air Force or other interested Defense Agency.

Richardson stated that about a year ago he was on night shift and was in the vicinity of 1st and Washington, Kennewick, at about 10 PM when he observed a large, shining, metal ball about 30' in diameter swoosh in from the West at rather low altitude—only 200 or 300 feet in the air or less. The ball was traveling at a high rate of speed and when it got about three blocks east of Washington Street it came to a complete stop. Richardson stated that the ball had a trail of fire until it stopped and then emitted no fire or smoke. Richardson described the ball as perfectly spherical and made of shiny metal. He stated that apparently the ball had a least two different kinds of motors, top, spoke type, because when it was standing still he could hear the "chug chug" of the engine sounding like a tractor engine and apparently an internal combustion engine.

Re: Unidentified Flying Objects                                Date: June 12, 1956

ball stood still several minutes and then took off with a speed so great
that it disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. Richardson stated
that obviously some different type of engine was utilized in flight such
as a jet engine because of the speed with which the ball left. Richardson

Richardson stated that the most disturbing thing to him is that
apparently the builders of the ball have mastered the pull of gravity.
He stated that this fact puts this country in a poor position defensively
as the ball obviously either came from Russia or some outerspace planet
in which case the Russians might get hold of it first. Richardson noted that
the ball was flying too low for radar detection and too fast for interception
by any known United States device. Richardson commented that the United
States does not have this ball or they would not be producing winged air-
craft, jet planes, nukes, etc. Richardson stated that he theorizes that
whoever built the ball is using the principle of likes attract and positives
repel to defy gravity and that the ship is flying on electron beams or some
other natural phenomena such as light waves. He stated he never saw the
ball again and has not advised other persons other than the FBI. He also
stated that he did not hear of anyone else seeing the ball but commented
that he is a skilled observer.

The above is for your information and no investigation is being
made by this office. There is no objection by this office to your investi-
gation of this matter and your interview of Sergeant Gordon Richardson.

Very truly yours,

Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Dear Sir:

On June 12, 1956, a letter was directed to your office reporting information furnished by Sgt. Gordon Richardson, Kennewick, Washington Police Department, relative to his sighting of an unidentified flying object. Sgt. Richardson has contacted our Senior Resident Agent at Richland, Washington a number of times since his original reporting of this incident and has stated that he is most anxious to talk to a representative of the Air Force concerning his observation of this unidentified flying object. Sgt. Richardson stated that he had some new information which apparently is not a new observation, but some theories on his previous sighting, which he desires to pass on to the appropriate representative of the Air Force. Sgt. Richardson has been advised that his original information was turned over to your office and that his subsequent contacts will also be furnished to you for your information. This matter was discussed with Major Russell Womack of your office on October 9, 1956 and he suggested that this letter be forwarded.

Sincerely yours,

R. D. AUERBACH
Special Agent in Charge
