II. SUMMARY: TWX message TC4107, classified Confidential, sent by Comdr ATIC, W-PAFB to Comdr, 4602d AISS and to Flt 1-B, 4602d AISS as information address, on 17 Dec 56, requested that elements of the 4602d AISS conduct a preliminary investigation of UFOB interest at Martinsdale, Montana (EKGB 4228). The message, received at 172015Z Dec 56, requested the three be undertaken a preliminary investigation of a UFOB fragment, or missile, supposedly possessed by Mr. [redacted] Martinsdale, Montana.

In a personal letter to ATIC, W-PAFB, Ohio, Mr. [redacted] had claimed discovery of an object which contained a self-supporting power unit activated by an unknown mineral. (-he had also requested that proper authorities contact him immediately on the matter. Upon investigation, Mr. [redacted] and the object allegedly in his possession was unavailable for contact. The object was presumably residence at Missoula, Montana (EKGB 0052) at an unobtainable address. The information in this report was obtained from three persons who had observed the object, and investigation was conducted to determine the physical characteristics and properties of the object.

I. SOURCE: Miss [redacted]
   Address: [redacted] Martinsdale, Montana
   Age: Approximately 40
   Occupation: [redacted]
   Education: 14 years
   Qualifications: [redacted], Martinsdale, Montana, 14 years.

II. RELIABILITY: Source, small woman of medium proportions, was vigorous and alert in her physical and mental actions. Her statements and vocabulary usage were indicative of a broadness of knowledge and were uttered with a preciseness and logical order of expression. Source initiated the discussion concerning Mr. [redacted] and the object discovered by him immediately after she had arrived at the residence of Mr. [redacted]. Upon confirming it, [redacted] department departure from Martinsdale, Montana and after very limited queries by the investigating officer regarding Mr. [redacted] education, occupation and mechanical aptitude, Source supplied all information on Mr. [redacted] which she had available. Much information was subjective and Source almost invariably labeled the relevant statements as such prior to uttering them. Source did not appear to be of the common "gossipy" type but rather appeared as an individual of normal discretion. Source's description of the object discovered by Mr. [redacted] was corroborated by testimony of other observers. Source's knowledge of local affairs in Martinsdale, Montana was also generally corroborated by other observers, with no apparent utterances or gestures of disrespect being utilized towards her. Her reliability is considered to be "C".

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT AND MR. [redacted]: Source was working at the Martinsdale, Montana Post Office, when on the evening of approximately 15 Nov 56, Mr. [redacted] entered the Post Office and, with excitement, informed Source that he had found an object which he deemed to be of great importance, and the proper identification of which he did not know. Mr. [redacted] did not explain why he considered his discovery to be of great importance, but Source did not remember the location. She thought it to be either near [redacted] or Shawmut, Montana [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] stated he had been herding cattle at the time of his discovery. Mr. [redacted] stated he had seen the object and it had been carefully wrapped in a common "gunny sack". Source asked to see the object and Mr. [redacted] unwrapped the object, offering it to Source for a cursory examination.

2. Object was a dull black-gray colored volcanic type rock. Object was approximately 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and approximately 7 1/2 inches (19.05 cm) wide. It had a uniform thickness of approximately 2 inches (5.08 cm). Surfaces of object did not have smoothness of glass or polished rock, but did not possess highly corticated and irregular surface such as is commonly found on some stone or rock fragments. When viewed from top, object was not completely circular, but elliptical in shape with two definite ends. Object was concave on one side and convex on the opposite side. The extent of concavity and convexity was approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) distant. From a horizontal line drawn from one end of the object to the other end appearing on the same side of the object...

                                                         ONE

The degree of sloping of the concavity and convexity was fairly uniform. Approximate weight of object could not be estimated or estimated by Source, but it, "weighed somewhat heavier than its size indicated". One fragment had been broken from object prior to Source's examination. Intrusion of object appeared volcanic in origin. Source associated the rock-like composition of the object with those types of rocks in which fossiled shell and leaf impressions are commonly found. Source claimed to have only a layman's knowledge of rock and geological formations and professed to have no background sufficient enough to correctly analyze and classify the substance of the object.

Source stated that local ranchers and herders frequently find metal components of airborne meteorological equipment and that usually these items are dispatched to the Martindale, Montana, Post-Office. Source stated that she had dispatched many such items via the mails to Malmstrom AFB, Great Falls, Montana (EKO4323) and that she was quite familiar with the above items, which have been brought to the Martindale, Montana Post Office in all types of conditions, varying from slightly damaged to extremely weathered and rusted.

3. Source states that many other people in Martindale, Montana had also observed the object discovered by Mr. _______, and that all observers, to her knowledge, had regarded the object as being an unusually-shaped rock, and thereby considering it of little importance.

4. During examination of object by Source, Mr. _______ appeared excited over his discovery and made numerous inquiries as to where or at agency or institution he might discover the identity and origin of the object. At no time did Mr. _______ appear to give the impression that he considered the object to be a UFOB or missile. Upon finishing her curmudgeon examination of the object, Source very jokingly stated to Mr. _______, "Hey Pete you've found a flying saucer!"

5. Source stated that from approximately 1938 until approximately 1950, when he had suddenly disappeared from Martindale, Montana to parts unknown, Mr. _______ at Martindale, Montana during early Nov 56 and had departed on approximately 10 Dec 56, Source could not estimate Mr. _______ age's! He had described him as an elderly. Source stated that he had had "odd jobs" about Martindale, Montana and with no comparable occupation of killing, odd or "peculiar" in habit. Source gave no reason for this belief. Source also stated that he considered Mr. _______ to be "harmless" in spite of his "odd" nature.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appeared intelligent and alert but was always in the presence of Mrs. SOURCE expressed interest in the collection and polishing of rocks possessing unusual characteristics or true however. SOURCE was quick to supply estimate on dimensions of object, but again, her statistical exacty reflected those given by Mrs. SOURCE. Her reliability is considered to be C.

III. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:

1. SOURCE during approximately latter Nov 56 or early Dec 56 saw the object discovered by Mr. SOURCE saw object at the Martinsdale, Montana Post Office on one occasion only during the above period of time. She had no other opportunity to observe the object.

2. SOURCE described object as being approximately 10 inches (25.4 cm) long, approximately 7½ inches (19.05 cm) wide, with a uniform thickness throughout of approximately 2 inches (5.08 cm). Object was elliptical in shape. Surface of object was described as smooth, but not as smooth as the surface of a polished rock or glass. The object was concave on one side and convex on the opposite side, with an approximately equal depth of concavity and bulge of convexity. Depth of concavity was estimated to be approximately 1½ inches (3.81 cm).

SOURCE described object as being dull black-gray in color, and considered it to be a volcanic type rock. SOURCE claimed that rock fragments identical in color and texture to object are prevalent in the Martinsdale, Montana area. She did not lift the object and could therefore give no estimate as to its weight. SOURCE claimed to have been rather disinterested in the object upon initially observing it, as the idea immediately struck her that a rock of such texture and color would be unfit for polishing and therefore of little consequence or regard to her.

3. SOURCE stated that she considered Mr. to be "odd" or "peculiar" but no additional explanation was given other than that she considered Mr. "harmless". SOURCE stated that local ranch-hands and herders have in the past often found objects lying on the ground which attract their interest, and which are then picked off the ground and brought to Martinsdale, Montana to be displayed as temporary curiosities to any acquaintance or friend who is approached. SOURCE claimed this to be a generally common characteristic of the ranch-hands and herders in the Martinsdale area.

4. SOURCE stated that metal components of airborne weather equipment are often discovered on the range areas about Martinadale, Montana, and that the discovering person, wherever he may be, generally brings these metal pieces to the Martindale Post Office, so that the pieces may be dispatched to Malmstrom AFB, Great Falls, Montana. SOURCE claims to be quite familiar with the above type metal items and expressed her opinion that the inhabitants of the locality generally are familiar with the metal items and their origin also.

5. SOURCE stated that she believed many other inhabitants of Martinadale, Montana had seen the object discovered by Mr. [redacted] and that the object was commonly believed to be a rock of unusual shape. SOURCE did not know of any such observers who dissented from the above commonly held opinion.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was gaunt and of medium stature. He was vigorous in action and speech. He appeared to display only the most casual interest in the object itself, but was quick to offer an estimate of its dimensions. SOURCE spoke intelligently but appeared possessed somewhat of an irritable and impatient temperament. He possessed numerous occasions to see and talk with Mr. [redacted]. SOURCE acted surprised when the investigating officer expressed interest in the object. SOURCE's reliability is considered to be C.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:

1. SOURCE stated that Mr. [redacted] frequented the cafe at the Martinsdale Hotel, and that within several days after Mr. [redacted] had discovered the object, Mr. [redacted] had brought the object to the cafe on his person. SOURCE would not estimate the approximate date.

2. SOURCE described object as being a lava-like rock, black-grey in color and shaped somewhat like a saucer due to its concavity on one side and convexity on the opposite side. SOURCE stated that the object was definitely elliptical in shape with two well-defined ends. He described it as approximately 8 inches (20.32 cm) long, approximately 5 inches (12.70 cm) wide and approximately 2 inches (5.08 cm) in thickness. The thickness appeared to be uniform throughout. The depth of concavity was estimated as approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm). SOURCE would not estimate the weight of the object but considered it somewhat heavier than its size would indicate. SOURCE stated that a fragment had been broken off of the object and that the interior of the object possessed numerous small "holes".

3. SOURCE stated that other persons in Martinsdale, Montana had observed the object and that all such observers had unanimously believed the object to be a form of rock.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. A check with a temporary bartender at the "Upper" Saloon, Martinsdale, Montana, where Mr. [redacted] rented an attached cabin, yielded information that the rent of the above cabin had been paid for through May 1957 by [redacted]. The bartender related that he had heard from the proprietors of the "Upper" Saloon, who were not available for contact, that [redacted] had taken up residence at an unknown address near Missoula, Montana (EKEB 0052) where he, Mr. [redacted] was to be employed as a herder. The bartender stated that Mr. [redacted] had taken all personal effects with him.

2. A check with one Mr. [redacted] Martinsdale, Montana, for additional corroboration of data relating to the object discovered by Mr. [redacted] yielded negative results, as Mr. [redacted] was not available for contact.

3. Contact was made with Detachment 6, 9th Weather Sq, Malmstrom AFB, Montana, concerning loss and recovery data pertaining to airborne meteorological equipment. Personnel of that unit stated that parts of one lost radio-sonde had been dispatched to their organization since August 1956. The Post Office or locality dispatching these radio-sonde parts could not be remembered. Personnel of the above unit also stated that prior to August 1956, many such parts had been dispatched to their section from rural areas of Montana, but that subsequent to August 1956, the U. S. Weather Bureau, Great Falls, Initial Airport, Great Falls, Montana became the only U. S. agency sending airborne meteorological equipment aloft. As the U.S. Weather Bureau meteorological equipment was equipped with U. S. Weather Bureau tags, most lost airborne weather equipment when been recovered, has been dispatched to the U. S. Weather Bureau, Great Falls, Montana.

4. Contact was made with Detachment 15, 19th Weather Sq, 29th AD (Def), Malmstrom AFB, Montana concerning loss and recovery data of airborne weather equipment. Results were negative, as such equipment has not previously been used and is not presently used by the above organization.

5. A check was made with the U. S. Weather Bureau, Great Falls Municipal Airport, Great Falls, Montana concerning loss and recovery data of airborne weather equipment. Personnel of the above agency stated that airborne weather equipment had in the past tended to land in a pattern following a geographically northward trend through Great Falls, Montana, and that such equipment and its components had at times been found in the rural areas about Harlowton, Montana (EKEB 1026) and had then been subsequently dispatched via U. S., to the U. S. Weather Bureau, Great Falls, Montana. The above agency dispatches two radio-sonde daily and enjoys an approximate plus 25% rate of recovery in regards to lost airborne equipment.

6. A check was made with Mr. [redacted] Geologist, U. S. Geological Survey, Great Falls, Montana concerning the geological characteristics of the Harlowton, Montana and Martinsdale, Montana areas. Mr. [redacted] explained through the use of geological stratigraphy maps that lava rocks and fragments are very apt to be found on the earth's surface in the Harlowton-Martinsdale Montana district. Approximately 8 miles due south of Martinsdale, Montana are located the Crazy Mountains (EKEB 4222). Approximately 27 miles due south (180 degrees) of Martinsdale, Montana are located the Crazy Mountains (EKEB 4202). Both of the above mountain ranges...

are composed of lava formations. Mr _______ stated that lava fragments and rock lying in the earth's surface would be especially common in the area about Martinsdale, Montana and that the discovery of such fragments in the Harlowton, Montana area would be very possible, due to past geological activity. Additional action being forwarded such fragments in a northeasterly direction from their source in the Castle Mountains area. Mr _______ displayed specimens of lava rock which ranged in color from through black-gray to light black. Holes varying from approximately 1/8 inch (.32 cm) diameter to pinpoint diameter were observed to be characteristic of the lava specimens. Mr _______ further explained that the above holes had been produced by gases when the lava had still been in a molten state and that the dimensions of the holes were regulated by the pressures involved. Upon examination within the lava with still in molten state, Mr. _______ stated the specific gravity of 2.65-2.70 is characteristic of lava. Furthermore, specific gravity of lava may rise to 2.8 in cases where extreme pressures has been exerted upon and within molten lava. Mr. _______ described the areas immediately to the east (90 degrees) and to the southeast (135 degrees) of Harlowton, Montana as containing basically sedimentary type rocks. The composition, coarseness or fineness of grain, as well as color and density of sedimentary type rocks were described as variant to an extreme.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER

1. In view of the fact that neither Mr. [redacted] nor the object allegedly
discovered and possessed by him were available for interview and observation,
conclusions herewith set forth cannot logically be represented as extending
beyond the realm of "probable" or "possible". Without direct observation,
the conclusions reached must remain tentative and the report itself must
remain, in a sense, one of supplementary investigation.

2. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object discovered by
Mr. [redacted] was a probable fragment or piece derived from an earthly
geological formation. Reasons for this opinion are as follows:

a. All Sources maintained that the object resembled a rock or categorically
stated that it was rock.

b. All Sources mentioned a lava or volcanic origin of the object.

c. The object discovered by Mr. [redacted] appears to closely coincide
in texture, weight, and substance to the lava type rocks displayed and
described at the U. S. Geological Survey Office, Great Falls, Montana.

d. The Martinsdale-Harlowton, Montana area was designated by U. S. Geological
Survey, Great Falls, Montana as a district in which lava fragments
maybe found laying on the earth's surface.

e. Due to the absence of data concerning the site and circumstances of the
object's discovery, little support for advancing a theory of meteorite
origin is available.

f. All Sources maintained that the object had been seen by other inhabitants
of Martinsdale, Montana and no Source knew of an observer who had dissented from the opinion that the object was a rock or rock fragment.

g. It appears inconceivable that a self-supported power unit, if indeed
seen by many observers, would be regarded as a rock in a small rural
community, a type of community which in my sociologically noted
for me, who of necessity, possess mechanical interests and aptitudes,
but is also famed for its word-of-mouth power; in regards to unusual
phenomena or occurrence.

3. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, it is possible that a misconception
born of unfortunate circumstances, rather than a deliberate hoax, has
influenced Mr. [redacted] in requesting a USAF investigation of his
object. If it is indeed a type of rock. Reasons for this opinion are as
follows:

a. SOURCE [redacted] identification of the
object with a type of missile to one of her very own remarks.

b. The information concerning Mr. [redacted], given by SOURCES [redacted],
though certainly not verified and possibly tentatively, suggests a
possibility that Mr. [redacted] may have earnestly believed his
object to have been related in some way to a missile.
