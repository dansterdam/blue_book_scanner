I. SOURCE: Miss [redacted] 
Address: [redacted], Martinsdale, Montana
Age: Approximately 40
Occupation: [redacted] 
Education: 14 years
Qualifications: Martinsdale, Montana, 14 years.

II. RELIABILITY: The source, a small woman of medium proportions, was vigorous and alert. She gave evidence of mental agitation and vocal excitation, but her gestures and physical appearance were rather restrained. The behavior of the source indicated the discussion concerned an event which had immediately preceded the incident about which the source volunteered information. Upon confirming Mr. [redacted] departure from Martinsdale, Montana and after very limited probing by the investigating officer, the source supplied all information on the sighting which she had available. The source did not appear to be of the common gossip type, but rather appeared as an individual of normal intelligence. Source's description of the object observed by Mr. [redacted] was corroborated by testimony of local affairs officials. There was some conflict with other objects previously reported as locals claimed the object described was similar in appearance. Her reliability is considered to be "C".

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT AND OBSERVATION: The source was working at the Martinsdale, Montana Post Office when on the evening of approximately 15 Nov 56, Mr. [redacted] entered the office and reported the observation of an unidentified flying object. The source stated there were several persons in the office at the time, the identity of which he did not know. Mr. [redacted] did not explain why he considered his object important, but source did not remember the location. She thought it to be either near the Martinsdale (6 miles northeast) or Mr. [redacted] ranch. The object was described as one the size of a large flashlight, approximately 6-10 inches (15.24-25.4 cm) wide, spherical and the color of a dull black-gray. Object was approximately 10 to 15 inches (25.4-38.1 cm) long and had a trail of light or flame approximately 2 to 3 inches (5.08-7.62 cm) in length. The object was observed to be moving at a very high rate of speed and was in sight for approximately 2 to 3 seconds. The object did not make any sound. The source stated that Mr. [redacted] appeared to have been carefully watching the object and source assumed it to be of some importance to him. She was unable to make any further comment on the object.

The text in the document discusses the details of a UFO sighting in Missoula, Montana. It mentions the degree of sloping or tilting of the UFO, estimated based on observer accounts. The report also discusses the composition of the object, comparing it to various types of aircraft. It mentions the object's unusual maneuverability and the observer's inability to correctly analyze and classify the substance of the object. The report also mentions that the observer had dispatched an inquiry to Air Force officials in California, but the results of that inquiry are unknown.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PART FOUR

1. A check with a temporary bartender at the "Upper" Saloon, Martinsdale, Montana, where Mr. ___ resided, provided the information that the rent of the above-named saloon had been paid for through July 1956 and that he had heard from the proprietors of the "Upper" Saloon, who were not available for contact, that Mr. ___ had taken up residence at an unknown address near Missoula, Montana (EKGS 0052) where he, Mr. ___, was to be employed as a bartender. The Bartender stated that he had taken all personal effects of Mr. ___ from the "Upper" Saloon.

2. A check with one Mr. ___, Martinsdale, Montana, for additional corroboration of data relating to the object discovered by Mr. ___ yielded no results, as Mr. ___ was not available for contact.

3. Contact was made with Detachment 6, 9th Weather Sq., Malmstrom AFB, Montana, concerning locations and recovery data pertaining to airborne meteorological equipment. Personnel of the above unit stated that parts of one lost radio-sonde had been retrieved to their organization since August 1956. The Post Office or locality dispatching these radio-sonde parts could not be determined. Pertinent of the above data indicated that parts of radio-sonde equipment has been found in various areas of Montana, but that subsequent to August 1956, the U.S. Weather Bureau, Great Falls, Montana, became the only U.S. agency sending airborne meteorological equipment aloft. As the U.S. Weather Bureau meteorological equipment was shipped with U.S. Weather Bureau markings, some of this latter equipment has been dispatched to the U.S. Weather Bureau, Great Falls, Montana.

4. Contact was made with Detachment 15, 19th Weather Sq. 29th AD (Def), Malmstrom AFB, Montana concerning locations and recovery data of airborne weather equipment. Results were negative, as such equipment has not previously been used in present areas by above organization.

5. A check was made with the U.S. Weather Bureau, Great Falls Municipal Airport, Great Falls, Montana, concerning flight and recovery data of airborne weather equipment. Personnel of the above agency stated that airborne weather equipment that had been landed in a field in a certain location in Montana was recovered in good condition and that such equipment and its components had at times been found in the rural areas about Martinsdale (EKGS 2056) and had then been sub-sequently dispatched via U.S. mail to the U.S. Weather Bureau, Great Falls, Montana. The above agency dispatches two radiosonde dailies and enjoys an approximate plus 25% rate of recovery in regards to lost airborne equipment.

6. A check was made with Mr. ___, Geological Survey, Great Falls, Montana concerning the geological characteristics of the locations, Martinsdale and Harlowton, Montana areas. Mr. ___ explained through the use of geological structure maps that lava rocks and friable gray rock that was found on the surface in the Harlowton-Martinsdale, Montana areas are located on the Castle Mountains (EKG 4202). Approximately 27 miles due south (180 degrees) of Martinsdale, Montana are located the Crazy Mountains (EKG 4202). Both of the above mountain ranges are indicated as having geological characteristics similar to those described as being associated with the object discovered by Mr. ___.

are composed of lava formations. Mr. stated that lava fragments and rocks lying on the earth's surface would be especially common in the area about Harlow, Montana and that the discovery of such fragments on the site in question could not necessarily have any relation to unusual alluvial actions having transported such fragments in a northeasterly direction from the apparent impact site. Mr. played specimens of lava rock which range in color from brown through black-gray, on lighters from approximately 1/8 to 3/8 inches thick. He further explained that the above holes or cavities have been produced by when the lava had been in a molten state and that the dimensions of the holes were regulated by the pressure in the molten state. Mr. stated that the specific gravity or density of such lava is obviously less than 3.5 and that an average specific gravity of
0.70 would be characteristic of this type of rock. Mr. explained that extreme pressure has been exerted upon and within molten lava. Mr. advised that the area immediately to the west (90 degrees) and to the southeast (135 degrees) of Harlow, Montana as containing basically sedimentary type rock.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER
1. In view of the fact that neither Mr. nor Mrs. were available for interview and observation, the conclusion reached was that the object was beyond the realm of "probable" or "possible". Without direct observation, the conclusions reached must remain, in a sense, one of supplementary investigation.
2. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object discovered by Investigating Officers remains a problem for identification as definite conclusions as to its nature are not justified.
a. All sources maintained that the object resembled a rock or catefgorically stated that it was rock.
b. All sources mentioned the object as lay or volcanic origin of the object.
c. The object discovered by Mr. apparently closely coincide in texture, weight, and substance to the lava type rocks displayed and described at the U. S. Geological Survey Offices, Great Falls, Montana.
d. The Martinsdale-Harlowton, Montana area was designated by U. S. Geological Survey, Great Falls, Montana, as a district in which lava fragments maybe found laying on the earth's surface.
e. Due to the absence of data concerning the site and circumstances of the object's discovery, little support for a definite theory of meteoritic or other nature can be advanced.
f. All sources maintained that the object had been seen by other inhabitants of Martinsdale, Montana and the source knew of an observer who had distinctly observed the object as a rock or rock fragment.
g. It appears inconceivable that a self-supported power unit, if indeed seen by many observers, would be regarded as a rock in a small rural community, a type of community which is not only sociologically noted for what others consider as "cranks in the woodpile" psychological interests and attitudes, but is also famed for its word-of-mouth powers in regards to unusual phenomena and occurrences.

this is in regard to my flying object sighting some time ago. i am located at an ammunition -depot, approximately 7 miles west of missoula, montana. on jan 9, 1957 an object was observed and i would like to call some details to your attention.

the object was circular in shape and bright silver in color. it was observed between 4:35 pm and 4:40 pm. the object appeared to be traveling in a northerly direction at a very high rate of speed. the speed was estimated at about 900 to 1000 miles per hour. i am a reserve officer in the air force and have had considerable experience in observing aircraft.

this object did not resemble any conventional aircraft that i am familiar with. there were no visible wings, tail surfaces, or any sign of propulsion. the object appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. it was not affected by the wind and did not emit any smoke or vapor trails. i would appreciate receiving any information that your office may have regarding this sighting.
