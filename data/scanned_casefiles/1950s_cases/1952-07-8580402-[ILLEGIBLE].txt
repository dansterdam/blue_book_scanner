DATE OF INFORMATION: 21 July 1952
SOURCE: Lt Josephine J. Stong, WAF, AL-1856019
(Capt Edward E. Dougher, AO-521169)

SUMMARY: (Under separate cover. Give information in most concise form. List details of report. Begin brief of report.)

1. Forwarded herewith are the accounts of the observations by two (2) USAF office-rs, Capt Edward E. Dougher and Lt Josephine J. Stong, of unidentified flying objects over Wiesbaden, Germany, at approximately 1930 hours Zebra on 21 July 1952. The pre-paring officer is making this report in accordance with AFR 200-5, Part II of this report.

2. Captain Dougher, a pilot not presently on flying status, and Lt Stong, a WAF, are considered by the prepayant officer to be absolutely reliable. Inquasch, as their observations were very similar and were made from two completely different locations in Wiesbaden at the same time and in the same area, it can be safely assumed that they both observed the same demonstration.

3. The information in Part II is presented in accordance with the requirements in AFR 200-5.

4. This information will be of interest to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, ATTENTION: ATIAC-20.

    1st INDGRS Letter 200-5, Dated 27 APRIL 1952

SUMMARY:

At 1043 Daylight Time, 25 July 1952, the following information was received by this station (P-49) from the COG Filter Center at Syracuse, New York:

COG POST GN 138 at New Berlin, New York, reported an unidentified flying object was spotted at a point 20 miles NW of GN 1137 at 2210 hrs, 25 July 1952. The object was continuously observed for a period of 30 minutes. It was cylindrical in shape, yellowish white, very high and moving in an oval pattern. Object was changing direction every five (5) seconds.

The weather was clear, good visibility, with high scattered clouds.

After 2237DT sightings were intermittent; object seemed to be losing altitude and appear to be ball shaped rather than cylindrical. It then faded in the distance to the North.

The authenticity of this report is unknown as information was very brief and given by only one source.

This object was not picked up on the radar at this site at any time.

A series of 6 inflated balloons mounted vertically and approximately 4 orbital planes on the same string. Approximately 10 inches below bottom balloon was located a small metal container. & of feet below the container was a half domed shaped screen. Drifting 25 miles in 1 hour. The metal box was approximately 12 x 16 x 5 feet. The object was sighted at 1810s and it was kept in sight for 60 minutes. The A/C were vectored into the area and then observed 1st balloon. The balloons drifted at a 90 degree angle to the reported wind. A/C were located at midegree 35 minute latitude and 75degree 15 minutes longitude, passes were made at all angles. Lbs. Torres and Babb were experience and their reliability is unquestionable. At the time of sighting, the wind was 3/10 degrees at 60 knots. There was not other activity in the area at the time that might otherwise account for the sighting. A sketch of the object is enclosed. Passes were made at the object, the closest being 30 feet. There were no other A/C in that vicinity at the time of the report.

because she had no idea of the distance to the light. She did say that from her observation point the light traveled some 15° in the sky. Nothing unusual was noted concerning the flight characteristics, and no noise was heard. Lt Strong did say that shortly after observing this light she became aware of a C-47 in the same general direction. Comparing relative sizes she said the light appeared to be about four (4) times the length of the fuselage of the C-47.

2. Time of sighting was from 1925 hours Zebra to 1935 hours.

3. The observation was visual from the ground.

4. Lt Strong was located in downtown Wiesbaden, and the lights were first seen in a NNW direction from her position. Altitude and distance are unknown, although Lt Strong did estimate the objects to be about 500° to the horizontal.

5. Lt Strong is a WAF officer with no flying experience to speak of. She is considered to be very reliable.

6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. (See Observation of Captain Dougher (Par A. of this report.)

PREPARING OFFICER'S COMMENT:
Lt Strong was about one (1) mile closer to the initial "burst" of lights than was Captain Dougher. Lt Strong's position was a almost exactly between Captain Dougher's original position and the direction in which the burst was observed.

1. One or more unidentified flying objects were observed from Alhambra, California 21 July 1952. First sighted 1900MST and observed for four minutes by a private pilot and two relatives.

2. Reported as a round, silver colored object, with a flat surface, at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet.

3. Object was North of Alhambra, heading North then East-northeast, in an erratic flight-jogging from side to side.

4. Weather in the area at time of sighting:
   a. Los Angeles reported (1830PST) broken clouds at 300 feet, visibility restricted to 2½ miles by haze and smoke. Temperature 62, dew point 57, surface winds from local at 12 MPH. March Flight Service forecast favorable visual conditions only over the coast only, and that weather at Alhambra (15 miles Northeast of Los Angeles International Airport) was clear with 5 to 15 miles visibility.

   b. Winds aloft at 40,000 feet were from 200° at 11 knots.

5. Witnesses were: Mr. [REDACTED] of Alhambra, California, and his wife, and mother-in-law. Mr. [REDACTED] is a private pilot with 150 solo hours flying time.

6. The only known air traffic in the vicinity was a B-29 at 17,000 feet.

7. Incident was reported to Los Angeles ARTC Center by the observer, and to March Flight Service Center 212121P July via Flight Service Communications System.

Comments of Preparing Officers:
1. Reason for observer's statement that he observed "a flying saucer", possibly
2. Unknown. Report does not otherwise indicate more than one object.

This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. Chief witness was the weather observer for Trans-Texas airlines who was thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloons, etc.

Object covered an arc of approximately 100 degrees in 45 seconds, had no visible aerodynamic features, had a bright afterglow and a rotating movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher every second and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to in back of it, thus giving some estimate of distance. Object observed in broad daylight. It is too bad this one was not much more thoroughly investigated since there were two adult witnesses and one 14-year old witness. It must be carried as unknown. I have rated it a 2G.

10. 25 June 1952, Japan/Korea area.

This is not a single report but a collection of 13 radar reports which occurred in 1951 and 1952. No adequate explanation been given by the radar expert for any of these and therefore a lack of fair and impartial judgment as to their cause. This is one strictly for the radar experts.

11. 22 July 1952, Maxwell, Texas.

Evaluation as possible meteor is not tenable if object was seen to climb from 8,000 feet to 14,000 feet, then to hover, then to drop at an angle of 45 degrees, continue hovering, and fly south at 5,000 feet. It was reported by four air police and a state sergeant.

This is clearly a case which should have been followed up further. Proper classification: insufficient followup, or insufficient information.

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas.

This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. Chief witness was the weather observer for Trans-Texas Airlines thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloon, etc. Object covered an arc of approximately 100 degrees in 45 seconds, had no visible aerodynamic features, had a bright afterglow with a strange movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher every second and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to in back of it, thus giving some estimate of distance. Object observed in broad daylight. It is too bad that this one was not much more thoroughly investigated since there were two adult witnesses and one 14-year old witness. It must be carried as unknown. I have rated it as 2½ C7.

13. 24 July 1952, Carson Sink, Nevada.

Sighting just three to four seconds in duration, too short a time to make any definite observations. Witnesses were two lieutenant colonels flying a B25 at 11,000 feet. In view of the fact that there were two qualified witnesses, case must be carried as unidentified (limited data).

14. 28 December 1953, Marysville, California.

A one-witness case. Even though observed by a fairly qualified witness it is very strange that there were no other witnesses since

SUMMARY (Enter summary of report. Give identifying paragraph. List enclosures if any. Begin text of report on AF Form 112- Part II)
The report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object was made by an observer and station manager for Trans-Texas Airlines, Marlin, Texas, who related an observation made while at Waco, Texas, on 22 July 1952. The observer was located at the airport, near Waco, Texas. This headquarters submitted the report to ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, properly by electrical means.

The object was sighted at Waco, Texas at 11:05, 22 July 1952.

The observer described the object as being large and round, or silver color. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and at an altitude of 20,000 feet. The object was very bright, almost like a large searchlight. It was visible for approximately 15 to 20 seconds. To the observer, the object appeared to be well over 1,000 miles per hour. Possible population centers and visible land could not be seen. The observer was travelling from east, about 20 degrees from the horizon, to southwest. The object seemed to climb at a steep angle and disappeared behind a large cumulus cloud. The observer did not see the object again.

The observer was located at 29 degrees 11 minutes 18 seconds latitude and 99 degrees 46 minutes 35 seconds longitude.

Clouds were scattered; cloud base, 3,000 feet; visibility, 15 miles; temperature, 93 degrees; dew point, 86.

No known aircraft were in the air in the locality at the time of sighting and the wind was noted to be from the east.

The object was also sighted by a passenger who was in the ticket office with the observer. The name of this passenger is not known by this headquarters.

No information relative to the observer is available at this headquarters. He did state that he had been doing his job long enough to know that the object sighted was a hit, might be a weather balloon.

129TH FIGHTER INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON
Greater Air Force Base
Manchester, New Hampshire

19 July 1952

STATEMENT

As per verbal request of Major Cook the following report is submitted:

At approximately 213° hours, 14 July 1952, I was flying at angles two, three miles east of Greater Air Force Base, Manchester, New Hampshire, on a heading of 350 degrees, when I noted a bright object, apparently from the west. This object appeared to be at four to five thousand feet on a east south-easterly course, and in a ten to fifteen degree angle of descent. The head of this mass was bright white, followed by a slight pink, then blue tinge. A short white trail was behind this mass. After three to four seconds a bright object departed from the main mass and traveled sharply downward, disappearing in approximately one second or less. The main mass continued on its course for another one to two seconds, then suddenly faded. Assuming that this mass was in the immediate vicinity of Manchester, I would estimate its speed at two thousand miles per hour. If this mass were at a greater distance than those you would be substantially increased.

Sketch below is the general shape of subject mass:

133D FIGHTER INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON
Grenier Air Force Base
Manchester, New Hampshire

19 July 1952

STATEMENT

At approximately 2130, on 18 July 1952, I was in the Mobile Control Unit at Grenier Air Force Base (South of Manchester), when I observed a bright come object descending through space. It appeared to be moving from southwest to northeast at a shallow angle of descent at a speed comparable to a fast jet or rocket. The altitude seemed to be below ten thousand feet.

The object was visible for approximately five seconds during which time I could plainly see a definite trail (shore) end a bright color, with a blue and yellow haze (something like burning magnesium). At the time it appeared directly over Manchester, a portion separated from the object and faded, and a few seconds later the main body of the object faded before reaching the earth, probably about two or three thousand feet. This estimate of altitude would seem close if the object was the size of an aircraft or similar size.

In conclusion I believe the object to be a meteorite or similar heavenly body.

Greater Air Force Base, N. H.

21 July 1952

SUBJECT: Flying Saucers

TO: Operations & Training Officer
Greater Air Force Base
Manchester, New Hampshire

1. At approximately 0230 hours, 18 July 1952, the undersigned was working at the "A" position stand controlling two aircraft who were shooting landings. The aircraft were two F-47's, Raymond 35 (4/6 "951) and another T-27.

2. The mobile control unit was in position for runway 17 and was being handled by Lt. M. Newhall. At approximately 0300 hrs, 4/6 T-27 was on approach north of the field for runway 17 and was being watched by the tower. At this time an object appeared in the sky moving at a fast rate from the west towards the east.

3. The object was at about 200 or 300 feet when it first appeared and descended towards the 1st Tactical Control Squadron. The object seemed to be a brilliant yellow and was about 200 feet in diameter. Estimated speed of the object was in excess of 1000 miles per hour.

4. The object was in sight for about four seconds so those estimated are many much estimates. The runway control officer asked aircraft 7107 if he had seen the object and the pilot replied that he had.

5. The tower personnel thought no more of it until General radio overheard advising Boston Control that this object had been sighted by some civilians in Dunstable. At Greater tower told them it had been sighted here by the tower personnel, two pilots, and the runway control officer. Later tower had a call from Headquarters G.C.I. Security who also wanted a report.

6. I contacted 132nd Fighter Opns and asked that the pilot of aircraft 7107 come to tower a report on what he had seen. The pilot, Major Fisher said the object was north to east on a downhill course. It was blue, yellow and pink in color and seemed to have a tail like a comet. The object

1. In accordance with existing directives, AFOIN/INSO (Unclas) file, herewith forwarded for your information, a report of unidentified flying object sighted 12 August 1952, in the Town of Rockland, Sullivan County, New York. The report was made by Joe William J. Gross, 3 N.S.R.R., Route 1, Box 162, Monticello, N.Y., Military Subcontract, Miss Construction Co., Narrowsburg, N.Y.

a. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT SIGHTED: A white cloudy bright area was observed about the size of ordinary white egg shell would appear on the horizon. An intense beam from a point apparently from the object was seen. The witnesses from the horizon, as it moved toward the witnesses, there was a large searchlight approximately 1/10 the size of the sun. The ball or light moved over this white cloudy object. This object (approximately 2 minutes). Then gradually there after, another object on the broadside of the viewer. The horizon essentially turning from half-facing the witnesses. The object was then seen to approach as if on the watch broadcast. It was approximately the size of a small ocean going vessel. This object was orange in color and it moved closer to where the horizon could just be seen behind the object. The wind was very slow. It then disappeared several into the west at a rapid move in front of the horizon. It was clearly visible behind the surface object during this time.

b. The object was sighted on 20 July 1952 for a duration of 1930 hours on 20 July 1952 with the naked eye.

STATEMENT

I was scrambled from Misawa Air Base, at approximately 2020I hours on the night of 23 July 1952 while flying: At 18,000 feet on a heading of 015 degrees, I was approximately 5 miles from a briefing point. Approximately five minutes (5) later at XMH 2410, I saw a greenish blue light approaching, approximately 5 o'clock low and 500 feet. By first thought, one that it was the navigation light from another aircraft. As it leveled off in formation with me just back of my right tip tank I realized that I should be seeing a red navigation light if it was another aircraft. As I started to turn into the light it stopped its forward motion, and made an erratic maneuver downward out of sight.

This light had no strange glow nor tail behind it. It closed on me rapidly, and I was indicating about 285 knots. It disappeared into a navigation light of another aircraft "flying 500 feet from my aircraft. No other aircraft were reported in my immediate vicinity. Visual contact was not made after its erratic maneuver. I am sure it was not a reflection from/or in my aircraft. Weather was CAVU. The entire incident lasted not more than 15 seconds.

D/Y TSAF Comments

The "strange phenomena" referred to in the statement by Captain Lamb was a very bright light which appeared to be located along the coast of Hokkaido at approximately 1200N-1400N. This light appeared much brighter than the normal dull yellow lights displayed on the fishing boats in the area, and was seen by both the pilot and radar operator.

The radar operator was directing his attention to the scope at the time of the encounter. The object dove out of sight just as he looked out. The pilot rolled hard toward the object and tried to follow it down, but reported that it disappeared very rapidly. A search of the area showed nothing unusual after the brief observation.

1. Object seemed to be spherical with five projecting arms. The center of the object had a bright orange glow. The arms seemed to shoot out of the arms at intervals of three to five seconds. The flames had a red and yellow tint. The object appeared southwest of the observer at a range of 50 to 150 miles at 5,000 feet. It was moving northwestward, charged to move in which 15 minutes at a "running line for 5 to 10 miles, made a slight swing motion, began a dive toward earth for 500 feet, stopped and then faded away into the distance. The object appeared two to three feet around and had no sound. (SGN SCOTT)

Air Force Intelligence,

Dear Sirs:

I want to report a strange object I saw at 11:00 p.m.
on the night of July 23-52. Also I have a rough sketch of the object
and will enclose with this letter. Below is how I saw it.

After listening to the Democratic Conv. at 11:00 p.m/ of
7-23-52 I went outside about the sky, for I had read in the
past week of Flying Saucers reportedly seen over Louisville, and
after that I begin looking for them, for I had previously saw
them in 1948 & 1949. I live in Russel Co. which is located in
the S. Eastern part of Ky. At time I saw object it was S. West
of me, at a range I would say of from 50 miles to 150miles, and
at a height of around 5,000 ft. Its movement was West North West
while I veiwed it. It moved in a bouncing line to the North for
what I thought to be 5 to 10 miles, then it seemed to make a
xxx slight swinging motion, and then it begin a dive toward the
earth for what seemed to be 500 ft. and it looked as if it just
stopped, but as I watched on it begin to fade into the distance.

There was no sound, and the distance I was from it, it
looked about 2 to 3 ft. across it.

What I have said and the sketch I have submitted resembles what I saw a mass man here in
Russel Springs, and we have read quite a lot about Flying Saucers, and so I have duty
to report this                                                 Sincerely

- Center
- Kelner
- Godyville
- Glens Ford
- Marrowbone
- Beaverdale

The map appears to be a geographical map with grid lines, showing an area around Knoxville, with various geographical features and town locations marked.

These cilic-shaped objects in perfect
formation, high, at very high speed, were
observed by two of us in July 1952.

Note: Some parts of the text are partially illegible or cut off, so I have only transcribed the text I can confidently read.

Carson Sink, Nevada
July 24, 1952

Three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) were observed by two Air Force Pilots in B-25 aircraft at 11,000 ft altitude on July 24, 1952 at 1540 hours, PST. The objects were shaped like silver-white arrowheads (somewhat similar to a Delta wing aircraft) and appeared slightly larger than an F-86 aircraft. The speed was estimated as very fast; total observation time was three - four seconds. The time was too short to make any definite observations. The sighting is carried in Air Force files as unidentified.

10. 25 June 1952, Japan/Korea area.

This is not a single report but a collection of 13 radar reports which occurred in 1951 and 1952. No adequate explanation has been given by the radar expert for any of them and therefore I pass as far as any judgement as to their cause. This is one strictly for the radar experts.

11. 22 July 1952, Maxwell, Texas.

Evaluation as possible meteor is not tenable if object was seen to climb from 8,000 feet to 14,000 feet, then to hover, then to drop at an angle of 45 degrees, continue hovering, and fly south at 5,000 feet. It was reported by four air police and a staff sergeant. This is clearly a case which should have been followed up further. Proper classification: Insufficient followup, or insufficient information.

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas.

This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. One was the weather observer for Trans-Texas Airlines who was thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloons, etc. Object covered an arc of approximately 100 degrees in 45 seconds, had no visible aerodynamic features, had a bright after-glow, and a gyrating movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher every second and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to back of it, thus giving some estimate of distance. Object observed in broad daylight. It is too bad that this one was not much more thoroughly investigated since there were two adult witnesses and one 14-year old witness. It must be carried as unknown. I have rated it as 24 (7).

13. 24 July 1952, Carson Sink, Nevada.

Sighting just three to four seconds in duration, too short a time to make any definite observations. Witnesses were two lieutenant colonels flying a B25 at 11,000 feet. In view of the fact there were two qualified witnesses, case must be carried as unidentified (limited data).

14. 28 December 1953, Marysville, California.

A one-witness case. Even though observed by a fairly qualified witness it is very strange that there were no other witnesses since

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States

AREA REPORTED ON: Carson City, Nevada

DATE OF REPORT: 20 July 52    DATE OF OCCURRENCE: Jul 52

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (EXCERPT)

Three unidentified flying objects were reported seen by Lt. Col. John L. McElhin and Lt. Col. John R. Barton. These two officers are presently assigned to Headquarters, U SAF and were enroute from Hamilton AFB, California when they observed these objects. The objects were described in shape somewhat similar to a Delta wing aircraft.

Lt. Col. McElhin states that he is aware of the latest US experimental aircraft and these objects do not conform to any of them.

Drawings of US experimental aircraft were shown to the two officers but not one of the experimental aircraft shown was identified as possibly being the unidentified objects.

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

[Overhead diagram with Horizon, North, South, and a stick figure labeled "You"]

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

I first noticed the object at approximately 60° above the north-southeastern horizon. It proceeded almost across the sky in a due northerly direction, passing about 10°-15° easterly of the zenith and disappearing beyond trees at the north-northeastern horizon.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(See 17 above. The objects were individually quite small - larger but less luminous than a first magnitude star or a planet. They appeared to have fuzzy perimeters - not clearly defined.)

SECTION E:

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this?
(Circle One): Yes or No

26.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I cannot explain then. I have been interested in things astronomical and meteorological since boyhood, and have never seen anything like this.

28. Give the following information about yourself:
NAME [redacted]
ADDRESS [redacted] CHICAGO 4, ILL.
TELEPHONE NUMBER [redacted]
What is your present job? ATTORNEY
Age 36
Sex M

29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:
MISS [redacted] ABERDEEN, S.D.


- page 116 -

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

Answer to 19 + 20:

These questions cannot be answered in terms of the chances listed. Because of the complete strangeness of the object, I cannot estimate their distance, and size in appearance depends on distance, and their apparent speed also depends on distance.

Assuming they were at 50,000, they would have been about 10 the size of a small plane each, and again assuming that altitude, they would have been traveling at 2000 - 3000 m.p.h. to have crossed the arc of the sky as they did in 4 or 5 seconds. This time seems short, but in my excellent position for observation, it was enough to take careful note. I have watched meteors, the aurora, and the skies generally enough, to be personally convinced they were not an astronomical or meteorological phenomenon.
