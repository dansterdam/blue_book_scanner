Case 167, Los Angeles, Cal., July 16, 1956-We quote from the Los Angeles Examiner, as follows: A mysterious light that glowed brilliantly in the sky before it disappeared in a sudden blaze touched off hundreds of calls to police from residents in the southwestern area. Workers at the control tower at the International Airport estimated the altitude of the strange object at about 2000 ft. They said it emitted a strong reddish glow similar to the red nose light on a Constellation. As seen from the tower, the light moved in a southeasterly direction, about seven or eight degrees above the horizon. The tower couldn't estimate its speed, but said it moved at a blimp-like pace. A check, however, showed there was no blimp or plane in the area at the time. The light was visible for about four minutes from 11:02 p.m. on. Then it suddenly blazoned forth in an orange glow and vanished from sight.
