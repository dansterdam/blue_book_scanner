SUPPLEMENT TO AF ORE 112

Enterprises had been in use for the purpose of attracting business. This possibility was suggested to the observers but was dismissed by them as a probable explanation since the object was of a different color than the searchlights being used to attract business, and also the fact that it was obscured by the clouds.

8. Large weather balloons and advertising balloons released at distant points from the observer would often be sighted in this area as the object was about the size and general appearance of this type of balloon, and the fact that it emitted a bright silver light under the conditions stated.

9. Negative

10. Negative

11. Five minutes after disappearance of the object, two single-engine military aircraft passed over heading west at a low altitude.

12. Comments of investigating officers.

a. Mime disclosed was observed in the act-of the observers. These observers, however, do not alter the fact that all of the observers saw the same object in the same manner at the same time.

b. More investigations and inquiries have failed to produce any factual information bearing on the identity of the observed object. It is felt that it was an unidentified flying object.
