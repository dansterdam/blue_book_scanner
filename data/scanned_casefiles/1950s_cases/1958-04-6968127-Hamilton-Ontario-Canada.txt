Mister;

I am writing to you regarding
an object I saw come to earth on Thursday
April 18th at about 7:30 PM. I was driving
out to my cottage for the weekend,
I was going about 50 mih, on # 24 highway,
when all of a sudden the woodsbrush and
field to my right lit up bright as day.
Looking up I saw a ball of fire coming
at 60° angle straight for my car, but it
landed to my right back of a small woods
about one mile away, I marked the place
on the highway & I went on to my
cottage & hurried the woods on (for) the

The text in the document reads as follows:

news but not right about anything to do 
with this matter, when I came home, I reported
what I saw to the Royal Canadian Police,
and our Force and Dominion Police.
They mentioned it might be a balloon
or ic switch but it doesn't jive, what I
saw. So I saw your article in life,

The image does not contain photographs. It is a hand-drawn sketch and annotations which seem to describe observations or characteristics of unidentified flying objects (UFOs):

The page contains several sketches of different shapes with corresponding notes. There is a sketch resembling a line of trees with another notated as "North" with a partial outline labeled as "Trees." Below these are two more sketches: one resembles an object with a flat bottom and curved top, captioned with text regarding its size and appearance like a "blast furnace." The other sketch looks like an oval or elongated shape. There are various handwritten notes surrounding the sketches.

Here is the text present on the document as requested:

Some words are indistinct due to the poor quality of the handwriting and the image itself. It appears to be notes possibly related to an observation of an unidentified flying object, considering the context of Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force.

Dear Mr. ------

Thank you for your letter of 21 April 1958 describing your obseravtion
of an unidentified flying object on 13 April 1958. All available
evidence indicates that Sputnik II re-entered the atmosphere and
disintegrated on 13 April, but you possibly may have seen a meteor.

We are forwarding your letter to the Air Technical Intelligence
Center, Peyton, Ohio as a matter of possible interest. Your interest
in reporting your observation is appreciated.

Very truly yours,

1. Attached letter was forwarded to this Center by NRL.

2. The following are submitted to assist you in replying to Mr. Rous, observer
   of the UFO:

   a. The very careful attention to details essisted us in determining the
      identty of the object.

   b. For example, the description of the object "red glowing space in the
      head" and that the "place was lit bright as day" are typical characteristics of
      a true bollde or "Fireball."

3. A large number of bolides (a very brilliant-fiery specie of meteorite) have
   been reported during the last nine (9) months from throughout the U.S.

Dear 

This is to acknowledge your letter of 21 April 1958
concerning an unidentified flying object you saw on
13 April 1958 near Hamilton, Ontario.

From your description of the object, it had all the
typical characteristics of a bolide or "fireball". A
bolide is a very brilliant--very special meteorite.

Your careful attention to details allowed us to
identify the object and your report will become a part
of our continuing study on aerial phenomena.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
