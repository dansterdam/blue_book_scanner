Hamilton
Canada

Dear Sir;

I am writing to you regarding an object I saw come to earth on Thursday April 15th at about 9:30 p.m. I was driving up to my cottage for the week-end. I was going about 50 m.p.h. on # 24 highway when all of a sudden the road burst, and I felt to my right lit. My sight was day looking up I saw a ball of fire coming at 66° angle straight for my car, but it landed to my right back of a small wood, about one mile away. I marked the place on the highway & I went on to my cottage. I switched the radio on for the

saw. So I saw your article in Life,

I can see some words and fragments like:
- "place"
- "blue"
- Some arrows and sketched circles/diagrams

Much of the text is difficult to read completely due to the light handwriting and low contrast of the document.

Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

Dear Mr. [Redacted]:

Thank you for your letter of 21 April 1958 describing your observation of an unidentified flying object on 13 April 1958. All available evidence indicates that a Southwest 15 weather balloon disintegrated on 13 April, but you possibly may have seen a meteor.

We are forwarding your letter to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Dayton, Ohio as a matter of possible interest. Your interest in reporting your observation is appreciated.

Very truly yours,

L. I. Baird

ROUTING
(Initial "IN" column to denote series prior to action, initial "OUT" column to denote review of completed action. (V for version for coordination))

TO: SAFIS-3, Major Tacker
FROM: AFCIN-4B

DATE: 19 May 1958

COMMENTS (use reverse, if necessary):

1. Attached letter was forwarded to this Center by NRL.

2. The following are submitted to assist you in replying to Mr. Rous, observer of the UFO:

a. The very careful attention to details assisted us in determining the identity of the object.

b. For example, the description of the object "red glowing space in the head" and that the "place was lit bright as day" are typical characteristics of a true bolide or "fireball".

3. A large number of bolides (a very brilliant-fiery species of meteorite) have been reported during the last nine (9) months from throughout the U.S.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 21 April 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object you saw on 14 April 1958 near Hamilton, Canada.

From your description of the object it had all the typical characteristics of a bolide or "fireball". A bolide is a very brilliant-fiery specie of meteorite.

Your careful attention to details allowed us to identify the object and your report will become a part of our continuing study on aerial phenomena.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,
