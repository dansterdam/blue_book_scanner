Extracted text from the document:

4 August 1952

At 10 AM on 1 August 1952, as I was entering the Security Service compound with a group of airmen returning to work after a weekend, I observed in the clear upper atmosphere a moving cylindrical object, traveling at a very high speed and altitude.

It appeared to be at a high altitude and was moving at a high rate of speed, silently. My attention was drawn to it almost immediately as it seemed to be traveling at a rate of speed much higher than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.

It appeared to have some depth, possible one to six inches in diameter, and remained in sight for several minutes, during which time I observed no appreciable change in its size, shape, or speed. It seemed to be traveling in a horizontal position, neither climbing nor descending, maintaining a constant altitude.

STATEMENT

On Friday, 1 August 1952, at approximately 1000 hours, I noticed a flying object in the sky. The altitude of the aircraft was impossible for me to estimate but appeared to be considerably above the cloud layers which was reportedly 2200 ft. The object was observed for approximately 25 to 30 seconds. The aircraft was heading in a northeasterly direction. After I observed the object for a short period of time, it increased in speed tremendously and disappeared in a northeast direction, about 1 and 1/2 minutes.
