FINAL EVALUATION

On 18 November 1954, T/Sgt. Drepperd called Lt. Cmdr Ross, Office of Naval Research, relative to the UFO's observed over the Kentucky Tennessee area. Cmdr Ross stated he wasn't sure if the UFO's could have been the Navy's research balloons. He informed Sgt Drepperd he would check and call him back.

On 22 Nov 54, T/Sgt Drepperd received a call from Mr. M.W. Keith ONR Resident Representative at the University of Minnesota. Mr. Keith stated that on 12 & 13 Nov 54, two (2) balloons were launched from the University of Minnesota. The payloads came down; one (1) over Danville, Kentucky, the other over Carlisle, Kentucky. Mr. Keith further stated that he believed the UFO's in question could very possibly have been these balloons.

Due to all available information from observers, which basically compares to those descriptive characteristics of a balloon in flight, and since there were two (2) research balloons in the same area at the time of the sightings, the UFO's observed were high altitude research balloons.

CASE HISTORY AND EVALUATION 12 Nov 54, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY

Background:

15 Nov 54: Major C. Williams, Ft. Knox, Kentucky, called 1st Lt. Athens of Flt 3-B, 4602nd AISS to report an UFO observed over Louisville on 12 Nov 54. Refer to Attachment #1.

13 & 15 Nov 54: Two newspaper articles were extracted from Dayton newspapers relative to the same UFO sighting over Louisville. Refer to Attachment #2.

17 Nov 54: Mr. [REDACTED], Physicist with the Oak Ridge National Laboratories, attending a conference with AMC officials at WPAFB, visited ATIAE-5 relative to a UFO observed by him over Knoxville, Tenn. Mr. [REDACTED] was not sure of the date and stated the UFO was observed on either the 14th or 15th of Nov 54. The UFO was described by Mr. [REDACTED] as being transparent, round and hovered at a very high altitude. He stated he saw what appeared exhausts from 2 jet a/c pass the object, one in front of it and one behind it. Mr. [REDACTED] further stated that he and his associates had always had an unofficial interest in UFO's and had in the past, been able to satisfactorily identify most of the UFO reported by the newspapers. However, in this particular instance, he was startled by the size of the UFO which he could see extremely well, but was unable to see the jets that passed by it. He saw only the jet exhausts. He realized that the object could have been, and probably was a balloon of some sort, but desired the official evaluation if possible.

ATIC ACTION: T/Sgt Drepperd, who interviewed Mr. , told him that from
all indications the object he saw was the same one or one similar observed over
Louisville, Ken., a few days earlier. Also, preliminary investigation suggested
that the object was probably an experimental balloon released by the General
Mills Corporation in Minneapolis, Minn. Sgt. Drepperd informed Mr. Green that
when positive identification is made of the object, that he, Mr. Green. will be
notified per his personal request.

The identity of the ADC Unit in Knoxville was established as the 460th FIS
of McGHEE-Tyson Airport. If there were jet a/c in the air near the object, as
stated by Mr. Green, they were more likely assigned to this unit. A wire of
inquiry dated 18 Nov 54 was forwarded to the Intelligence Officer of this unit
relative to the sighting.
Refer to Attachment 03.

6 Nov 54: On this date, 3 civilians observed a UFO over the vicinity of
Brandenburg, Kentucky. 1st Lt. Athens, FIt 3-3, 4602nd AISS interrogated the observers on 11 Nov 54.
Refer to Attachment #4.
ATIC EVALUATION: Preliminary investigation suggests objects observed in all of
the cases above to be balloons. Quite possibly it was the same experimental
balloon released by the General Mills Corporation. General Mills is presently
under contract with the Air Force and Navy for experimentation research program
of the upper atmosphere.

No further queries were made by Mr. Hart regarding the aforemetioned.
    
    b. The purpose of Major Williams’ call to Flight 3-B was to obtain information regarding the AF policy on the release of information to news media regarding UFOB’s and what his action should be should similar occasions arise in the future.

    Lt Athens informed Major Williams that in those cases where such sightings have been positively identified as known objects, as was the case in question, then it was within Major Williams authority to release such information to any of the news media which may be making inquiries. Major Williams was also informed that only in those cases where such sightings were not identified he was instructed not to release any information, but to inform the individuals making queries that such releases would come from AF sources authorized to give such information. AFR-200-2 was brought to the attention of Major Williams. Aforementioned AFR governs the release of UFOB information as well as affixing responsibility for the investigation thereof,

    c. The above situation is in general the discussion as occured in phone conversation between the individuals stated in par. 1.

Mr.
Oak Ridge National Laboratories
MOMAAA, Post Office Box
Oak Ridge, Tennessee  

Dear Mr.

In reference to your personal request made to me during your recent visit, may I say that our original suspicions regarding the unidentified flying object in question have now been confirmed.

The object which you observed over Knoxville was one of two high altitude plastic experimental balloons released on the 12th and 13th of November 1954 from the University of Minnesota.

The U. S. Office of Naval Research and the University of Minnesota are presently engaged in an atmospheric experimentation research program and as a result, launch special types of balloons which are considerably larger than the average weather balloon.

Thank you for your interest in the unidentified flying object program and please feel free to contact us for any assistance you may require in the future.

Sincerely,

ALBERT W. DREPPERD
T/Sgt USAF
ATIAA-5

Daily News
Shiny Object At Louisville Unidentified

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 13. (AP) —Despite efforts of the Air Force and speculation by curious onlookers, that shiny object over Louisville was recorded officially today as "unidentified."
Seemingly motionless at an estimated altitude of 80,000 feet a few degrees northwest from downtown Louisville, the silvery object caught the stares of thousands of persons yesterday from about 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
A jet fighter plane from Wright-Patterson Air Force base, Dayton, cruised the sky for a close bump, the pilot said he failed to sight the object after climbing to about 40,000 feet.
The object was a gleaming white at first, slowly turned yellow, finally red, and then faded into the dusk.
Reminiscent of the "flying saucer" days, newspapers and radio stations here were swamped with telephone calls while the "thing" hovered cryptically above.
Charles Strull, veteran member of the Louisville Astronomical Society, said "It's not a celestial body" because its color changed as the sun went down.
Meterologist O. K. Anderson said: "From our observation it certainly didn't seem to be a balloon—it showed so little movement."
Wright-Patterson Air Force base spokesmen said Saturday that investigation of the "unidentified object" was assigned topnet, and refused to confirm or deny the report about the fighter plane from the base here.

Mysterious Object Could Have Been Plastic Balloon

MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 15. (AP) —A General Mills, Inc., research laboratory spokesman said today that an object sighted over Louisville, Ky., last Friday possibly was "a large plastic balloon released near Minneapolis a day earlier."
The Minneapolis milling firm's scientific laboratory manufacture the white plastic balloons and sends them aloft in co-operation with the office of naval research, which is conducting cosmic ray and other upper atmospheric studies. Hundreds of the balloons have been launched.
The balloon released last Thursday measured 50 feet in diameter and is 100 feet long. Its cargo of instruments was released by parachute over southern Minnesota the same day and was recovered near Austin, Minn.
No reports on finding the balloon had been received up to now. A mechanical device releases the cargo when the balloon reaches a prescribed altitude, usually in the stratosphere. 
A jet fighter plane from Wright-Patterson Air Force base, Dayton, was sent to Louisville Friday in an attempt to identify the object, but the pilot said he lost sight of it after reaching about 40,000 feet. The white object was estimated at an altitude of 80,000 feet.
After dropping its instrument cargo, a balloon usually rises rapidly and bursts.

Jet Pilots Solve Mystery of ‘Thing’

Flying saucer experts admit “something’s up,” David Dickey writes. Page Cl.

The sky yesterday afternoon produced a “mystery” which excited people in Knoxville, out in the county, in Barbourville, Ky.; and even as far away as Louisville, till the Air Force apparently solved it.

It was described by Knoxville observers as an almost rectangular white object, with irregular ridges. “Looked like it was right over Standard Knitting Mills,” said L. G. Gross, 103 Jefferson Ave., who viewed it through binoculars with two neighbors.

Fliers in two jet planes saw the object and flew to investigate.

Game Fans See Object

“It was a balloon,” said LI. Melvin Bowers and LI. Mark Shuder, after they landed back at McGhee Tyson Air Base.

“We flew it at about 36,000 feet and got under it. It was still some distance above us. Probably sent up by some distant weather bureau and drifted in here on an upper air current.”

Knoxville Weather Bureau reported it sent up a weather balloon yesterday morning, but it burst. No other was sent up yesterday by the local station.

Hundreds of fans at the Tennessee-Florida football game saw the object northeast of Shields-Watkins Stadium. Also observed was a moving vapor trail, apparently from one of jet interceptor planes.

Mrs. George A. Caldwell, of near Strawberry Plains, said she saw the object about 4.15 p.m. “It looked real big,” she said.  Looked ‘Lighted Up’

Another observer reported at 5:45 p.m. that the object was visible between Fountain City and Hall’s, and looked “lighted up.” At a great height it was probable that a balloon could have reflected light from the setting sun, although sunset was officially at 5:30 p.m. at ground level.

At Tazewell, Claiborne County Sheriff Dan Chumley said he watched the object, which appeared like “a real bright light ball, larger than my two fists.”

He said that after dark it proved to be a red star. “I never would have believed it,” he said. Sightings were reported as far east of Knoxville as Newport.

“I saw something that looked like a neon light,” said Jefferson County Sheriff John R. Coffey, Dandridge. “I watched it with my field glasses till night came, and it looked like a glass ball through the glasses.” Kingston Highway Patrol said it received no calls about the “saucer” but observed a very bright star in the east.

Traveling Slowly South

J. S. Werner, News-Sentinel correspondent in Barbourville, reported a “bright, shiny object appeared high over that city about 1:30. It was traveling very slowly south towards Knoxville.” In Louisville, Associated Press reported, “a shiny object, recorded officially as unidentified, caught the stare of thousands late Friday afternoon. Motorist in two Central Kentucky counties reported seeing an object like a meteor glowing green or blue Friday night.
