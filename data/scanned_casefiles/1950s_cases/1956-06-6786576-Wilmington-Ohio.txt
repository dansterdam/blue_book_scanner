FILE NO.                    SUBJECT     Unidentified Flying Object

TO    Capt G. T. Gregory    FROM ATIC SDO    DATE 27 Jun 56    COMMENT NO. 1

1. On 27 Jun 56, at approximately 1645, Capt J. M. Long, AO 794675, Base Operations, Clinton County AFB, Ohio reported by telephone an account of a UFO. Capt Long obtained his information from Sergeant Baker of the Ohio Highway Patrol Headquarters, Wilmington, Ohio. Sergeant Baker in turn obtained the original report from a 46 year old man and his two sons, ages 17 and 10.

2. The man and his sons were the ones who stated they actually saw the UFO. Capt Long did not have their names and addresses but believed that Sgt Baker had them. The information which Capt Long obtained is very sketchy and is contained in the attached technical information sheet. He is confident, however, that the man and his sons could give a much more complete account of the sighting.

3. At the time of the sighting, there were fighter aircraft in the vicinity. These aircraft were participating in flight test operations in the Restricted Area 109, which is used frequently by WADC in flight test operations.

4. The weather was clear with a fifteen mile per hour wind from the west. Visibility was at least 15 mile at the time of the reported sighting.

Saunders Case File

Approximately 2:25 p.m., 27 June 1956
, age 46, and sons,  , age 17;  , age 10
all of 115 Clemons Avenue, Jamestown, Ohio.

All supposed to report sighting a strange aircraft approximately 2.4 miles North of Wilmington, Rt. 314. When first sighted, the craft was below tree-top level. The craft appeared to be taking off on the ground; however, they did not see it on the ground.

Craft described appeared to be round - the diameter appeared to be the length of an automobile. A bulge in center of the top - looked like a canopy of a plane. It made no noise and there was no smoke or vapor trail. It was silver color. The craft was about 3' or 4' thick.

They stated they were familiar with the shape and outline of a jet plane. They said it was not a jet. They reported the craft moved very swiftly, climbing at a steep angle at first, then almost vertically. It was out of sight in three or four seconds.

The youngest boy said it looked like a "button."

This is a report from the Ohio
Highway patrol at Wilmington, Ohio
