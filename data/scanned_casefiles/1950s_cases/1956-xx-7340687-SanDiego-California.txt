The image contains a photograph of an official U.S. Air Force document. The document appears to be a form or diagram used for reporting UFO sightings as part of Project Blue Book. The diagram includes instructions for how to indicate the location and apparent movement of unidentified objects in the sky, as well as a compass-like diagram that seems to be used for tracking the objects' positions. There is also handwritten text providing additional details about the sighting, including the time, location, and number of objects observed.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5 Feb 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 
A large object was observed at a restaurant near Bonner Field in Colusa, California with a number of people from the area. The object was larger than a conventional airplane and did not have wings. It hovered for a period and then flew off rapidly. The people who observed the object are both reliable and credible.

Around the large globular object for several minutes before disappearing, becoming a little larger as it neared, appearing disc-shaped. The light object seemed to be glowing or surrounded by a glow at times, so bright at times that it was difficult to look at. It seemed to hang in the sky, remaining motionless for the most part but once in a while moving slowly or wobbling. Because so we unable to estimate size or distance it was very difficult to derive any definite conclusions. The witness felt it was too high and too large to be anything conventional. We lost sight of it because it seemed to blend into the hazy sky and apparently departed in that direction. The description seems to fit the general characteristics of some of the sightings recently recorded in this area.

26. In order that you can give us clear picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or object which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw: This object was still there and there in a while and then suddenly just take off and they shoot away out of sight. It was much smaller than the airplanes that were flying around, and it didn't make any noise and it seemed to glide without any apparent motion of wings or jets or anything like that. It just seemed to disappear out of sight very rapidly. Like it became invisible or blurred out and just disappeared. I couldn't say exactly how fast it was going, but it was obviously much faster than any plane I have ever seen before. I would estimate its speed to be around 800 to 1000 miles per hour, but I'm really just guessing at that. I've never seen anything like it before and I really don't know what to make of it. I certainly don't have any explanation for what I saw.

Attention: UFO Project Officer

Gentlemen:

The numerous sightings of unidentified flying objects that are currently being reported again bring to my mind a flying object which I observed about 10 years ago. I did not keep a record and do not know the exact date, but it is just as vivid to me now as it was the day it occurred and I have puzzled over it many times since.

As I recall, I reported it to the Strategic Air Command in Pasadena, but apparently it was assumed that I was some sort of a crackpot and little consideration was given. I was handed a standard form prepared for reports of this type, but it was not appropriate, that is, it failed to bring out the unusual circumstance involved, and the representative who talked to me showed little interest in my story so I dropped the whole thing at this point.

It is no doubt has little value so far as national security is concerned but I am particularly convinced beyond a shadow of doubt that the object was real and under control of some sort, as it defied all laws of gravity. It was also close range in broad daylight, with no possibility of confusion with any other object that I have ever seen, and nothing like that -- just its movements were unusual.

At any rate, I feel that the incident should be on record in case there are others who have reported seeing similar objects and following is a summary of the performance.

It was working at the 13th floor of the Federal Building, Los Angeles, when I casually looked out the window and saw at about the same level what I thought must be a balloon, but its shape seemed peculiar and its movement was not normal for a floating balloon and it immediately attracted my attention.

Further examination indicated that it was larger than an ordinary toy balloon, more oblong or pear-shaped. It was green in color with a slight metallic luster. As to size, I would estimate it to have been approximately 12 to 15 feet in diameter, as I viewed it from a distance of several hundred feet.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
No.
15. Did the object appear to change in shape or size while you were watching it? If so, describe the change in detail.
About 30 seconds.
If you answered YES, then tell what:
THE SUN'S EDGE BIT INTO THE SIDE OF THE OBJECT, AND IT SUDDENLY LOST ITS BRIGHT SILVERY APPEARANCE AND BECAME AN ORANGE-YELLOW HALF MOON.
16. Did the object show any structural detail or features? If so, describe in detail.
No.
17. Was the object in your view long enough for you to make an accurate estimate of its size? If so, give your best estimate.
Yes, the object appeared to be 5 times the size of the moon, which is about 1/2 degree diameter.
18. What was the elevation of the object above the horizon?
Directly overhead.
19. Draw a picture, or include a sketch, that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you may have described above. Please do not attempt to reproduce an artistic likeness of the object.

Proposed reply to letter from ________________, 10 February 1967

Dear Mr. _____________,

Please excuse our delay in answering your kind letter of 10 February 1967 in which you reported your unusual observation. 

I am unable to offer much of an explanation at this time without additional information concerning the details of what you could be possible you observed on _____________. These balloons are programmed to fly at approximately 100,000 to 130,000 feet and have often been mistaken for many UFO reports. This, of course, would depend on the details of the observation, wind, date, etc.

As requested, here is the text from the document:

Hato Reyes, Puerto Rico 0024
February 10, 1967

Major Quintanilla, Junior and Staff:

Today I read the special "LOOK" magazine article about the NICAP and the NICAP guide to UFO's and have decided to report you my own observation just as it occurred.

During the year 1956, I was living with my mother and brother at our home in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We lived in a house where its own, now lives and named on the street in front of the house at 12:00 Noon and suddenly over my head and with the palm of my hand covering the sun (as some overhead) I observed a brilliant air-like dish which seemed to me over 100,000 feet. It continued my mother and suddenly disappeared but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet. I continued my mother and sudden disappeared but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet. I continued my activities and with the palm of my hand covering the sun. After about 10 seconds it reappeared again and this time it stopped but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet. It continued my mother and suddenly disappeared but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet.

I heard then about the UFO and I am almost sure she saw it. She had told me that she was from St. Louis, Missouri and I was also told that she was a professor and Dean of the University of Puerto Rico and she was to the best of my knowledge a very fine lady as far as integrity and sincerity are concerned. The Ponce Parkville Guide, maybe, Puerto Rico, come on as Dean of the University of Puerto Rico, as he was in charge of students, is responsible for the activities on March 3, 1967, and I was also told that he was a very fine man as far as integrity and sincerity are concerned.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in the provided image. The image shows a page from what seems to be an old report document, containing handwritten text.

Transcribing the text from the document:

Would you be kind enough to write me your opinion as to what was what I saw?

During World War II I was a Radio Operator with rank of Sergeant. Our squadron received orders to stand by for 60 days. The 602nd Fighter Control Squadron had orders from the 52nd Troop Carrier Squadron to man the communications center. My Squadron Commander was Captain . I served over 5 years from 1941 to 1945 and am now on the retired list. I was awarded 14 medals and was in the European, Asiatic, Asiatic-Pacific and Indonesian campaigns. I am a native of Statesville, North Carolina. I was inducted in New York City. I hope you will consider what I have to say.

That's why I worked in a Radio Station on the ground but today I have quit drinking altogether. Etc.

Thanking you very much for your attention reading this letter and for what you might be able to do about the U.F.O. and wishing you good luck in your important duty, I am

Faithfully and sincerely yours, [REDACTED]

My mother and brother still live with me today. My address is [REDACTED]. I speak several languages: Italian, French, German, Japanese and Tagalog. My photographs were taken when I was studying from 6 months old, to 16 years old when I returned and came to live in the United States. My code (MORSE) speed was from 35 to 50 W.P.M.

RINGS APPEARED AND BEGAN TO SPREAD OUT...ONE, BENTON NOTICED, SEEMED TO BE GROWING LARGER.

SUDDENLY THE GIANT DISC TILTED. ITS SPEED SHARPLY REDUCED. IT ANGLED ON PAST.

THE COMMANDER LET OUT HIS BREATH. HE LOOKED AT MOONEY'S WHITE FACE. HE SAW THE DISC

STOP AND HOVER, THEN DART AWAY IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT TREMENDOUS SPEED.

The image provided does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a scanned page of text, which I will extract as follows:

about two feet in mid-diameter and three feet in the elongated axis.
The object was less than a block away, passing over some lower buildings across Main Street to the east. It seemed to be about fifteen or twenty feet in height. Though almost silent, it glided in a straight line for about two blocks and suddenly changed its angle of descent and rose over the expressway heading for a parking lot on the other side. 
I was sitting in my car. I would it would shoot up over them and on toward the northwest, but it floated up over them and on toward the northwest, but it floated up over them and descended slowly, without a sound. A question as to what could be holding it up as it was certainly about two feet in diameter.
Then it appeared to move a little to the south and then moved to the west side toward Main Street and floated almost to the ground. This was so clearly that I could read the letters on the stop sign at the corner as it moved slowly down the sidewalk.
Unfortunately there were no people in the area at the time to observe it. After depositing its strange burden oh the sidewalk, it rose abruptly to the roof of the building, again meandering slowly around about ten feet above the roof, and then passed out of sight over the Union Station about four blocks away.
One might wonder why I didn't call others to join me in witnessing this. I surmise the performance was so totally incredible that I didn't realize what I was actually seeing until it took off at such unbelievable speed and disappeared from sight. So uncontrolled object could rise vertically, change its direction so swiftly and take off at such great particularl y when it was so strange! 
I am now retired but at the time I was Supervisor in charge of the West Coast Special Branch of Oil and Gas Operations, U. S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, and, if desired, my identity can be checked.
If you know of any logical explanation for this unusual performance, I would certainly like to be advised. As I can not think of any, in any event, no one can ever convince me that I did not see the entire performance as reported.

Very truly yours,
L. G. Snow

No Case (Information Only) 3 January 1956 Pasadena, California

(2) Request for Information on UFO Sightings from General Public

January 3, 1956, - Pasadena.- A pilot and aerial cameraman sighted and attempted to track what they described as "three distinct objects" in the sky. The two civilians are co-owners of an Aerial Photo Company and have been flying for 15 years for the Army and commercial purposes. They have reports of 21 years in the air as an aerial cameraman and during home studies of the films, have not encountered anything like this before. The objects were sighted at an altitude of 11,000 feet when they sighted the military aircraft. The two pilots immediately attempted to close in on the three objects, but despite their efforts they only were able to close within 2,000 feet, and they both noted that they made definite maneuvers and had a brilliant light that seemed to emanate from them. It immediately flew to a higher altitude, a Gamma 100, into a circular course, while white trails to each of its mount left and disappeared in the west. Cramer said, " they were clearly outlined."

The Air Force viewpoint is that the so-called "flying saucers"is will account.

3. The following sightings, referenced by Mr. XXXX, were not received by this office.
a. 15 Dec. 1955, Cambridge
b. 3 Jan. 1956, Pasadena
c. January 1957, Florida

Any such releases are reported to newspapers, UVP clubs, or to individuals. This office never erases the "Evidence File Seal."

FIREBALLS FLASH OVER OREGON -- DAYLIGHT

Case 126. Chile Craco, Jan. 9, 1956. According to the report, this observer was driving along a highway during broad daylight (1:30 p.m.) when he noticed a bright light high in the sky, traveling at high speed and leaving a long trail behind it. He said the object appeared to be on fire and was traveling from east to west. The observer stated he watched it for about 30 seconds before it faded out. He said the object was illuminated by a brilliant white light and seemed to be cylindrical in shape. The observer claimed there appeared to be several "fireballs" or smaller fragments also streaking through the sky, all following the same general path as the original larger object.

"Gulf Gawks High in Sky
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 26 - Citizens here report sighting a strange flying object 'high in the sky' which 'resembles the planet Venus in size and color' but 'has a rapid oscillating motion,' it was reported here today. The sightings, which began at 6:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, continued for about two hours, with the object remaining stationary for long periods of time. Dozens of citizens of New Orleans called the local Civil Defense Office to report the strange phenomena. The object was described as 'round' and 'luminous,' changing colors from 'red to blue-green.' The area was checked by representatives of the Air Force, who could offer no explanation for the sightings. Citizens of New Orleans were reported to be 'somewhat excited' over the incident."

Dear sir,
The object I mentioned to you in my last call was flying, in a straight line at a high rate of speed, and described a curve as it made a sharp turn to the north. It maintained a constant altitude throughout, and the color of the object was brilliant white. Its size was comparable to a baseball, and it seemed to be glowing slightly, though I could not determine if it was self-luminous or reflecting light. The object disappeared rapidly toward the north. It was observed by several other persons in the area, and they corroborated my account. That occurred at approximately 7:55 p.m. on August 7, 1956.
I feel this object was something other than an aircraft or meteor, and I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding its identity and origin. Please let me know if you require any additional details from me.
Sincerely yours,

Cit- Here is what was said on the flight. She can do more for me than I can do for her. As she left there were some disturbance and excitement. I saw that she was very beautiful and lovely. Ours are myriads in that. I see that. Near that was a distance from here. I was troubled and I felt that I can be and have been in grave error in the attacks on these objects. They come from other planets. I was awakened and felt that I must on some measure do what I can to clear this up. For this are my sincerest wishes. I must keep this to myself. I'm so glad now I have seen something from other planets and hope, as you put it, that they will be friendly and not destroy us. Do let me know what you think and feel about this. I hope I have not bothered you in this.

P.S. I will see what I can do in tracing this incident.
