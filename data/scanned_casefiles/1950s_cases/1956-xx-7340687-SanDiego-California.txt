[Handwritten text, partially obscured, reads:]

I was at the time of sighting in 1956 with a friend at a restaurant near Clover Hill, in Cuba City during a hamburger when I saw 8 or 9 people from the window after 6:07. I was sitting side and pointing with the car. I saw 15 and what they are looking at. People in the park and proof of going. I also observed the people in the park. Also seeing a large sphere or light at a 35° or 40° in the sky of daylight and the moon to the left of object & several smaller objects that seemed to weave themselves

around the large globular object for several minutes before disappearing seemingly inside larger object. The large object with was stationary for minutes seemed to take off at thousands of miles an hour because as we watched it speed away from the same angle of vision it diminished to the size of a point light in a matter of seconds until it was stopped to see it any more. I hope you can appreciate this observation of this time is to bear the other point in my full parking lot undoubtedly accepted this sights and give probably have it in your files and I can verify this with who was with me at the time. We told our only another girl who was with me at the time. We told our only a few friends but that is about it.

Attention: UFO Project Officer

Gentlemen:

The numerous sightings of unidentified flying objects that are currently being reported again brings to my mind a flying object which I observed about 10 years ago. I did not keep a record and do not know the exact date, but it is just as vivid to me now as it was the day it occurred and I have puzzled over it many times since.

As I recall, I reported it to the Strategic Air Command in Pasadena, but apparently it was assumed that I was some sort of a crackpot and little consideration was given. I was handed a standard form prepared for reports of this type, but it was not appropriate, that is, it failed to bring out the unusual features involved, and the representative that I talked to showed no interest in my story so I dropped the whole thing at this point.

It no doubt had little value so far as national security is concerned but I am thoroughly convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that the object was real and under control of some sort, as it defied all laws of gravity. It was at close range in broad daylight, with no possibility of an optical illusion. No lights on it, no little green men or anything like that -- just its movements were unusual.

At any rate, I feel that the incident should be on record in case there are others who have reported seeing similar objects and following is a summary of the performance.

I was working at my desk on the 13th floor of the Federal Building, Los Angeles, when I casually looked out the window and saw at about the same level I thought must be a balloon, but its shape seemed peculiar and its movement was not normal for a floating balloon and it immediately attracted my attention.

Further examination indicated that it was larger than an ordinary toy balloon, more oblong or pear-shaped. It was green in color with a slight metallic luster. As to size, I would estimate it to have been

(Circle One)   Yes   No   Don't know.   If you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell us more about the object:
NO

18. We want to know enough about the size to compare it with a known object and note how much of the horizon or area it covered. If you held your arm out at arm's length, how much of the sky would the object cover? Compare its size to some familiar object such as a baseball, nickel, dime, sun, moon, etc. How much of the area of the sky was covered by the object?
THE FACE OF THE OBJECT AS SEEN
FROM THE EARTH SEEMED LIKE
WHEN OUT OUT AN ORANGE IN HALF.

19. Draw an accurate sketch that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you can recall, such as wings, propulsion, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction of flight.

Proposed reply to letter from____________, 10 February 1967

Dear Mr__________:

Please excuse our delay in answering your kind letter of 10 February 1967 in which you reported your unusual observation.

I am unable to offer much of an explanation at this time without additional information. It could be possible you observed an upper atmospheric high altitude balloon. These balloons are progr_________ fly at approximately 100,000 to 130,000 feet and have often been responsible for many UFO reports. This, of course, would depend on the location, wind data, etc.

Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico 00924
February 10, 1967

Major [redacted], Junior
Project Blue Book
Air Force Research and Development Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, OHIO

Dear Major Quintanilla, Junior and Staff:

Today I read the special "LOOK" magazine edition about Flying Saucers or UFO's and saw your picture on page 60 and have decided to report you my rare observation just in case it helps humanity in the earth to its defense.

During the year 1956 I was living with my mother and brother (who by that time was already a pharmacist) at [redacted] Street, San Juan, Puerto Rico in a concrete house where its owner now lives and named [redacted]. One day I was standing on the street in front of the house at 12:00 Noon and suddenly it gave me the idea of raising my arm vertically over my head and with the palm of my hand covering the sun (no clouds overhead) I saw right besides the disc of the sun a brilliant disc with steady light the size of the planet Venus or even larger. From the first 40 seconds first it was circling 360 degrees and it stopped but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet. I called my mother and brother and they saw it when it stopped. Also I called my neighbor a continental family wife of Major [redacted] of the Civil Air Patrol in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and I told her about the UFO and I am almost sure she saw it.

I heard the [redacted] family later moved to Florida, U.S., and she told me that she was from Saint Louis, Missouri and their children were [redacted]. I also called the José [redacted] family (Perkville, Guayama, Puerto Rico) and somebody saw it, too. A few days later I told it to Doctor [redacted] of the College of Natural Sciences of the University of Puerto Rico, but he did not tell me any opinion about the UFO seen by me and gave me as a gift a book of Physics which I still have. As a matter of fact, I know that Venus is seen constantly at 5:00 P.M. but never at 12:00 Noon.

[Top portion of document, dated December 10, 1957]

Would you be kind enough to write me your opinion about what was what I saw?

During World War II I was a Radio Operator with rank of Sergeant in the Pacific Theater of Operations with serial number [redacted] in the 63rd. Troop Carrier Group 13th Air Force. My group commander was Captain [redacted]. My Squadron commander was Major [redacted]. My communications section commander was Captain to 1945 and am now 3 years over 40 years old.

1956 OVER ATLANTIC OCEAN (KEYHOE-1960 P 16) 30 WITNESSES?
CRUISING AT 19,000 FEET, A NAVY R7V-2 TRANSPORT -- A FOUR ENGINE
SUPER-CONSTELLATION -- WAS FLYING WEST ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. THE NEXT
STOP WAS GANDER, NEWFOUNDLAND. FINAL DESTINATION, NAVAL AIR STATION, PATUXENT,
MARYLAND.

THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR. VISIBILITY UNLIMITED.
IN THE SENIOR PILOT'S SEAT, COMMANDER GEORGE BENTON WAS CHECKING THE
DIM-LIT INSTRUMENTS. ( SINCE THE COMMANDER AND MOST OF HIS CREW WERE STILL ON
ACTIVE DUTY. ) NAMES IN THIS REPORT WERE CHANGED. AT THIRTY-FOUR, BENTON HAD A
DECADE OF NAVY FLYING BEHIND HIM. HE HAD MADE THE ATLANTIC CROSSING MORE THAN
TWO HUNDRED TIMES.

BACK IN THE CABIN WERE TWO EXTRA NAVY AIR CREWS, EN ROUTE HOME FROM FOREIGN
DUTY. MOST OF THESE MEN WERE ASLEEP. INCLUDING BENTON'S REGULAR AND RELIEF
CREWS. THERE WERE NEARLY THIRTY AIRMEN -- PILOTS, NAVIGATORS AND FLIGHT
ENGINEERS -- ABOARD. THE CONSTELLATION.

AS COMMANDER BENTON FINISHED HIS COCKPIT CHECK, HE GLANCED OUT AT THE
STARS. THEN HE LEANED FORWARD, PUZZLED. A FEW MINUTES BEFORE, THE SEA BELOW
HAD BEEN DARK. NOW THERE WAS A CLUSTER OF LIGHTS, LIKE A VILLAGE, ABOUT
TWENTY-FIVE MILES AHEAD.

*WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE LIGHTS,*
MOONEY PEERED DOWN, STARTLED.
*LOOKS LIKE A SMALL TOWN.*
*THAT-S WHAT I THOUGHT.* BENTON QUICKLY CALLED THE NAVIGATOR, LIEUTENANT
ALFRED C. ERDMAN. *WE MUST BE WAY OFF COURSE. THERE'S LAND DOWN THERE.*
*IT CAN'T BE LAND.* SAID ERDMAN HURRIED FORWARD FROM HIS MAP TABLE. *THAT LAST
STAR SIGHT SHOWS --*

*BROKE OFF, STARING DOWN AT THE CLUSTERED LIGHTS.*
*WELL* SAID BENTON.
*THEY MUST BE SHIPS* SAID ERDMAN. *MAYBE A RENDEZVOUS FOR SOME SPECIAL
OPERATION.*
*THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE SHIPS,* SAID BENTON. HE CALLED RADIOMAN JOHN
WIGGINS. NO WORD OF ANY UNUSUAL SHIP MOVEMENTS. WIGGINS REPORTED, AND NO
SIGNALS FROM THE LOCATION OF THE LIGHTS. IF THEY WERE SHIPS, THEY WERE KEEPING
RADIO SILENCE.

*WAKE UP THOSE OTHER CREWS,* BENTON TOLD ERDMAN. MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN DOPE
IT OUT.*

IN A FEW MOMENTS, TWO OR THREE AIRMEN CROWDED INTO THE COCKPIT. BENTON CUT
OFF THE AUTOMATIC PILOT, BANKED TO GIVE THEM AND THE MEN IN THE CABIN A BETTER
VIEW.

AS THE TRANSPORT BEGAN TO CIRCLE, THE STRANGE LIGHTS ABRUPTLY DIMMED,
THEN SEVERAL COLORED RINGS APPEARED AND BEGAN TO SPREAD OUT. ONE, BENTON
NOTICED, SEEMED TO BE GROWING, IN SIZE.

BEHIND HIM, SOMEONE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION. BENTON TOOK ANOTHER LOOK. THAT
LUMINOUS RING WASN'T ON THE SURFACE -- IT WAS SOMETHING RUSHING UP TOWARD
TRANSPORT.

*WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT?* SAID MOONEY.
*DON'T KNOW,* MUTTERED BENTON. *HE ROLLED THE CONSTELLATION OUT OF ITS TURN*
TO START A FULL-POWER CLIMB. THEN HE SAW IT WAS USELESS. THE LUMINOUS RING
COULD CATCH THEM IN SECONDS.

THE GLOW, HE NOW SAW, CAME FROM THE RIM OF SOME LARGE, ROUND OBJECT. IT
REACHED THEIR ALTITUDE, SWIFTLY TOOK SHAPE AS A GIANT DISC-SHAPED OBJECT,
DWARFING THE CONSTELLATION. IT RACED IN TOWARD THEM.

*IT'S GOING TO HIT US* SAID ERDMAN. NUMBED. HE WAITED
FOR THE CRASH.

SUDDENLY, THE GIANT DISC TILTED. ITS SPEED SHARPLY REDUCED. IT ANGLED ON
PAST THE PORT WING.

THE COMMANDER LET OUT HIS BREATH. HE LOOKED AT MOONEY'S WHITE FACE, SAW
THE OTHER'S STUNNED EXPRESSIONS, WATCHING OUT THE PORT WINDOW. HE CAUTIOUSLY
STARTED TO BANK. HE STOPPED AS HE SAW THE DISC.

about two feet in mid-diameter and three feet in the elongated axis.

The object was less than a block away, passing over some lower buildings across Main Street to the east. It sort of floated along in a slow descent and it appeared it might come down on the freeway which passes a short distance north of the Federal Building. But it changed angle of descent and rose over the Freeway heading for a parking lot on the other side. I was sure it would hit one of the cars, but it floated up over them and toward a two-story building at the north end of the parking lot. Then without question I was certain it would hit this building, but when it came to within about ten feet of the building it took a sudden rise, moving parallel with the building wall up to the roof and then moved slowly over the top about five or six feet above the roof, somewhat like a dog often does looking for game. It then moved to the west side toward Main Street and floated almost straight down to about seven feet of the sidewalk. This was all seen so clearly that I could read the letters on the stop sign at the corner as it moved near and about two feet above it.

Unfortunately there were no people in the area at the time to observe it. After moving slowly along the sidewalk, it rose abruptly to the roof of the building, again meandering slowly around about ten feet above the roof. Then suddenly it took off at terrific speed and in an instant it passed out of sight over the Union Station about four blocks away.

One might wonder why I didn't call others in adjoining offices to witness the performance. Well, I was so absorbed in watching the strange movements that I didn't think of anything else, and, further, I didn't realize what I was actually seeing until it took off at such unbelievable speed and disappeared from sight. No uncontrolled object could rise vertically, change direction so often and take off at such speed, particularly when it was not designed for speed.

I am now retired but at the time I was Supervisor in charge of the West Coast Region, Branch of Oil and Gas Operations, U. S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, and, if desired, my integrity can be checked through that Department.

If you know of any logical explanation for this unusual performance, I would certainly like to be advised, as I can not think of any. In any event, no one can ever convince me that I did not see the entire performance as reported.

Very truly yours,
L. S. Snow

IT HAD SWUNG AROUND-WAS DRAWING ABREAST, PACING THEM AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YARDS. FOR A MOMENT HE HAD A CLEAR GLIMPSE OF THE MONSTER.

ITS SHEER BULK WAS AMAZING. ITS DIAMETER WAS THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE CONSTELLATION'S WING SPAN. AT LEAST THIRTY FEET THICK AT THE CENTER. IT WAS LIKE A GIGANTIC DISH INVERTED ON TOP OF ANOTHER, SEEN AT THIS DISTANCE. THE GLOW ALONG THE RIM WAS BLURRED AND UNEVEN, WHETHER IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL EFFECT, A SERIES OF EXHAUST OR LIGHT FROM OPENINGS IN THE RIM, BENTON COULD NOT TELL. BUT THE GLOW WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SHOW THE DISC-S CURVING SURFACE, GIVING A HINT OF DULLY REFLECTING METAL.

THOUGH BENTON SAW NO SIGNS OF LIFE, HE HAD A FEELING THEY WERE BEING OBSERVED, FIGHTING AN IMPULSE TO DIVE AWAY. HE HELD TO A STRAIGHT COURSE. GRADUALLY THE STRANGE OBJECT PULLED AHEAD, TILTING ITS MASSIVE SHAPE UPWARD, IT QUICKLY ACCELERATED AND WAS LOST AGAINST THE STARS.

COMMANDER BENTON REACHED FOR HIS MICROPHONE, CALLED GANDER AIRPORT AND IDENTIFIED HIMSELF.

*YOU SHOW ANY OTHER TRAFFIC OUT HERE* HE ASKED THE TOWER.

*WE HAD SOMETHING ON THE SCOPE NEAR YOU,* GANDER TOLD HIM. *BUT WE COULDN'T GET AN ANSWER*

*WE SAW IT,* BENTON SAID GRIMLY. *IT WAS NO AIRCRAFT.*

FROM THE ANSWERS TO SCORES OF QUESTIONS BY AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS AT GANDER, THE MAJORITY OPINION EMERGED. THE FLYING DISC WAS BETWEEN 350 AND 400 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND APPARENTLY METALLIC. NO INTERFERENCE WITH IGNITION PERIOD. INSTRUMENTS NOT OBSERVED AND RADIO NOT OPERATING DURING THIS BRIEF PERIOD. TIME FOR THE GIANT DISC TO CLIMB TO THE TRANSPORT-S ALTITUDE, BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHT SECONDS. INDICATED SPEED BETWEEN 1400 AND 2200 KNOTS. THE DISC HAD ACCELERATED ABOVE THIS SPEED ON DEPARTURE.

NOT ALL THE MEN IN THE CABIN HAD SEEN THE LUMINOUS RINGS. OF THOSE WHO HAD, MOST WERE WATCHING THE HUGE DISC APPROACH AND DID NOT SEE THE *RINGS* DISAPPEAR. IF THEY TOO WERE FLYING DISCS, IN A RENDEZVOUS AS SOME SUGGESTED, THEY APPARENTLY HAD RACED OFF WHILE THE OTHER ONE WAS CHECKING ON THE CONSTELLATION.

FIVE DAYS LATER, COMMANDER BENTON HAD A PHONE CALL FROM A SCIENTIST IN A HIGH GOVERNMENT AGENCY. *I-M INFORMED YOU HAD A CLOSE-UP UFO SIGHTING. I-D LIKE TO SEE YOU.*

BENTON CHECKED. FOUND THE MAN WAS CLEARED BY THE NAVY. NEXT DAY, THE SCIENTIST APPEARED, SHOWED HIS CREDENTIALS, LISTENED INTENTLY TO BENTON-S REPORT, THEN HE UNLOCKED A DISPATCH CASE AND TOOK OUT SOME PHOTOGRAPHS.

*WAS IT LIKE ANY OF THESE?* AT THE THIRD PICTURE, BENTON STOPPED HIM.

*THAT-S IT.* HE LOOKED SHARPLY AT THE SCIENTIST. *SOMEBODY MUST KNOW THE OTHER MAN TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THINGS.*

*I-M SORRY, COMMANDER.* HE CLOSED HIS DISPATCH CASE AND LEFT.

No Case (Information Only)                                   3 January 1956
                                                        Pasadena, California

(U) Request for Information on UFO Sightings from General Public

January 3, 1956.-Pasadena.- A pilot and aerial cameraman sighted and attempted to track what they described as "three circular objects" over Pasadena, but their plane was easily outdistanced.

The two civilians are co-owners of an Aerial Photo Company and have been flying together for three years. One has been flying for 19 years for the Army and commercial airlines, and has logged more than 10,000 flying hours. The other has spent years in the air as an aerial cameraman and during the War for RA.

They were returning from Bakersfield and were over Pasadena at an altitude of 4,000 feet when they sighted the "three circular aircraft near the mountains." Both men saw them simultaneously, according to [redacted] and they both noted that they were brilliant orange in color and that the lead aircraft had a white circle painted in the middle.

"Immediately threw our plane, a Cessna 180, into a tight circle to keep the three craft in our windshield," said [redacted]. "While I tried to take our aerial camera out of its mount but was prevented by the centrifugal force exerted by our tight turn."

The three craft made a complete circle around us at a distance of about five miles," Cramer said. "They then made another half circle and disappeared in the west." Cramer said, "they were clearly outlined against the mountains."

2. The Air Force viewpoint concerning so-called "flying saucers" is well known. No evidence has been found to prove their existence.

3. The following sightings, referenced by [redacted] were not received by this office:
    a. 15 Dec. 1955, Cambridge
    b. 3 Jan. 1956, Pasadena
    c. January 1957, Florida

Many such sightings are reported to newspapers, UFO clubs, or to individuals never reaching the AF-Public.

Case 126, Central Oregon, Jan. 9, 1956 - On the same date source and joint observed over Redford, Indiana, another variety of mystery sky flash. Intense white flash, scored over Oregon. The source states: "Approximately 1330 hours, Jan. 9, 1956, from reports submitted to Kenneth Pyle and Lake were two other observations of a bright flash in the sky. Two observers in the first instance described a bright flash like a photographer's flash bulb. The first came at a point high in the sky..."

BALL OF FIRE SEEN OVER OKLAHOMA TOWN: A mysterious ball of fire was reported on the night of Jan. 30th by Sherman J. McDonald, a garageman of Calvin, Oklahoma. McDonald said that he and two other people watched the object for about fifteen minutes while driving in their car. He said that it made no noise and gave off no heat. It came as close as a quarter of a mile before disappearing behind a hill. "The longer we watched, the brighter the object got," said McDonald. "We drove about five or six miles and finally stopped to watch it. My wife was asleep in the back seat when we stopped, and I woke her up. She said she had seen the moon before and went back to sleep. My sister-in-law and I sat there and watched, and it kept getting closer. We woke my wife up again and this time she saw it and started crying. She said it gave her the impression of a huge ball of fire. It seemed to be close to the top, but they could see it plainly. He added, "My sister-in-law started reading the Bible when she got nervous."
