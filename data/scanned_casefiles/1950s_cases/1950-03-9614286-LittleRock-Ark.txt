GUIDE TO INVESTIGATION (Cont'd)

Relative to Radar Sightings                        NOT APPLICABLE

1. Re Radars now operating on ground
   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
      of target.

   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180 degrees),
      etc., and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not
      observable, how long did the target stay in the turn and
      what was its speed.

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into
      several targets upon approach.

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent
      with size of object; faint, fading, pulsating at regular rate?

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted:
   a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits?

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.

                        GENERAL

1. Teletype sequences of local weather conditions: See attached
   EXHIBIT

2. Winds aloft report: See attached EXHIBIT

   a. Adiabatic chart for period in question: See attached EXHIBIT

3. Local flight schedules of commercial, private, and military
   aircraft flying in vicinity at the time:
   (Check Canadian activity if close to border.) No commercial planes.
   or private planes scheduled to land on this or next period
   mentioned. Planes could possibly pass over without planning
   (See page   to land, without Adams Field having a flight schedule on them.

No. 5, page (cont'd)
The following information was obtained from the Operations Officer, 164th Fighter Squadron, Adams Field (Ark National Guard):
(1) At 1648 hours, 17 March 1950, a "B-47" plane, AF No. 5846, arrived from Macon, Texas, which is southwest of Adams Field.
(2) At 1650 hours, 17 March 1950, a "T-47" plane, AF No. 1153, arrived from Hot Springs, Ark., which is southwest of Adams Fld.
(3) At 1645 hours, 17 March 1950, an T-17" NC No. 1369, arrived out of Pine Bluff, Ark., which is southeast of Adams Fld.
(4) At 1819 hours, 17 March 1950, a "C-45" plane No. AF 5635, left Adams Field flying east to Ft Knox, Kentucky.

NOTE: Mr. [redacted] stated at the time he sighted the objects, he called Mr. Thomas Tanner (a student within the plane), and Tanner glanced around, but not long enough to see anything.
Tanner, according to Mr. Bradford, has never soloed and was attempting to land the plane, and had his hands full.

Mr. [redacted], student pilot, Bradford Air Service, Adams Field, stated in an interview on 20 March 1950, that he could not honestly say that he saw the objects Mr. [redacted] reported. He stated that he had all of his attention concentrated on landing the plane at the time.
