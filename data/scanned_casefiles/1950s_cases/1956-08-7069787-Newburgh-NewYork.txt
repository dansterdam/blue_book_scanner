10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    Two round white objects, photographed side by side next to the sun. Objects were photographed with a Polaroid Camera using a Half step, a K2, and a polarizing filter. The shutter was set at 9.

11. COMMENTS
    ATIC Form 164 was sent to observer on 24 Aug 56. Concur with Reporting Officer that objects were the results of lens refraction. It is further the opinion of this Headquarters that:
    1. Image # 1 was a reproduction of the basic image (the sun) due to lens refraction.
    2. Image # 2 was also a reproduction of the basic image, but the source apparently rotated one or more of the filters producing the effect of the movement of the (Cont'd on back)

and then checked with Stewart Eichelb
A.P.B. if they had sent up any weather
balloons. They didn't.

Then at 12:00 PM I took a
second picture. It showed that
the objects had changed position and
came closer together.

I then called and told my
story to a Lt. Belany of the Intelligence

on the camera which might
have caused it.
