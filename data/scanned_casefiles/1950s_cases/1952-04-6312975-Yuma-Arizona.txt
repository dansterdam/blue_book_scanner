UNCLASSIFIED

1. On the afternoon of 17 April 1952 the undersigned took a group of Enlisted Weather Observers on a Field Familiarization hike from Yuma Test Station. All men were weather members of the MSU on duty at this station.

2. Between 1505 and 1510 hours MST one of the men, CWO, who has a degree in aerospace and a master's degree in meteorology, called attention of the group to an object directly overhead. At this time the group was seated on the east side, and in the shade of a tree, between the usual bank and the Colorado River, approximately three (3) miles north of Yuma Test Station on the Arizona side of the River. The object was seen immediately by the entire group without any difficulty in focusing the eyes or locating it overhead.

3. This object was first sighted by the group almost directly overhead at an elevation angle in excess of 60°. Due to the position of the group in relation to the canal bank, the horizon was obscured to a height of approximately six or eight degrees elevation. The total time the object was visible between the first sighting overhead and the disappearance over the horizon was very close to, and not more than seven seconds. In apparent size, the object subtended a circle of approximately 1/2 inch when held at arm's length.

4. The group was instructed that if any subsequent sightings are made while they are occupied in their assigned weather duties, that they should attempt to take bearings on the object from two or more theodolites, and report their findings to the Unit Commander. In this instance the apparent motion of the object was so fast that it would have been impossible to obtain angular readings on it with the theodolites even with the gears disengaged and sighting over the open gunsights.

5. Of the attached list of men, PFC and CWO are a graduate Engineer with propeller design experiences and M/SGT, a University graduate and was previously rated a flight engineer in U.S. Air Force. All of the men are extremely training as weather observers and have had some experience tracking meteorological balloons with optical equipment. All of the men commented that the object sighted was unlike any natural phenomenon which they had ever seen previously, and that they did not believe it could be mistakenly identified as a weather balloon. The group was told, pending further instructions, not to discuss this sighting. Attached is a list of the men in this group.

6. On the following day CWO and PFC reported another sighting with practically the same theodolite. The object was between five and ten seconds out the apparent motion so erratic that they were unable to obtain a sighting on the course of the object with a theodolite. In general appearance of the object was reported to be the same as that seen on the preceding day, except that no vapor trail was observed. The general occurrence of the object was in an easterly direction.

7. The undersigned has eleven (11) years military duty in meteorology, with a substantial portion employed on weather equipment, and on upper air observations entailing the use of many types and types of meteorological balloons. In my experience I have never observed any other object, by comparison with which this object could be further identified.
