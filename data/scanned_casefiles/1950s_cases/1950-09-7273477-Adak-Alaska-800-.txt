SIGHTING REPORT
AERIAL PHENOMENA OBSERVATION
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 7 September 1950 
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 2300 (GMT) 
LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: Adak, Alaska
DURATION OF OBSERVATION: Approximately 15 minutes
DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION: At 2300 hours on 7 September 1950, four persons stationed at Naval Air Station Adak, Alaska, observed a number of unidentified aerial phenomena hovering over Adak Harbor. The objects appeared to be disc-shaped and were illuminated with a bright light. The objects maneuvered at high speed and changed direction abruptly before disappearing from view. Photographs were taken of the objects, but the images are unclear and do not provide sufficient detail for positive identification. No sound was heard during the observation. Weather conditions at the time were clear with moderate winds.
CONCLUSIONS: The objects observed by the witnesses cannot be conclusively identified based on the available information. The rapid movement and unusual maneuvers of the objects are indicative of advanced technological capabilities beyond current known aircraft. Further investigation and analysis of the photographic evidence may yield additional insights, but no definitive determination can be made at this time.
