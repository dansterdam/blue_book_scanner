(3) Written inquiries: (U)
Federal Aviation Agency, Air Route Traffic Control Center, Municipal Airport, Kansas City, Missouri
Lt Gormley, 5lth FIS, Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, pilot T-33

(4) The above persons and agencies were contacted in this investigation. No positive conclusion can be made by the reporting officer as to what the observers may have seen. In the signing by this report the only related flights are the L-19 and the T-33. The L-19 flew a course that would possibly be related to the described course of the light seen by MSgt. But the aircraft had a red rotating beacon underneath and should be easily discernible to the observer at the altitude the aircraft was flying.

Mr [redacted] and Mr [redacted] looking thru telescopes should be able to distinguish auxiliary lights of an aircraft. The time the sighting was made rules out sun reflection or any known aircraft flying at the time. Therefore the preparing officer cannot reach a conclusion as to the identity of the sightings.

1. The following report is the result of an investigation conducted by Captain [redacted] and SIGST [redacted] as requested by ATIC, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Message, AFCIN HELG 7-1561. (U)

a. In answer to questions contained in the message: (U)
   (1) Just a light was seen. (U)
   (2) The size is purely an estimate and is not too reliable. (U)
   (3) It was difficult to estimate the true distance of the object but from the observer's description at first sighting, it was thought to be about thirteen (13) miles from the observer by measurement of a map in accordance with the description. No reliable estimate offered on altitude when the object passed overhead. (U)

   (4) Observer describes the turns as axis turns and the second turn as smoother. (U)

b. Upon investigation of the sighting mentioned in the newspaper, it was found that this incident probably occurred on 26 June 59. It was published in the Lincoln paper and broadcast on local stations by coincidence on the same date as the reported sighting by Mr [redacted] The hearing of a radio broadcast prompted the observer in the original report to call the Base Provost Marshal. The story from Nelson, Nebraska was evidently picked up by a reporter making a cutout of the small towns and published at a later date. The source of this report, in reporting Officer's opinion, is considered by the reporting Officer as unreliable. In his estimate of what he saw, his intelligence level is unknown, but probably a low average or below. (C)

c. Further investigation of the incident revealed the following information. Interviews are in accordance with the format prescribed by paragraph 15, AFR 200-2. (U)

   a. (1) Appeared like a "Sputnick". (U)
      (2) About the size of a prominent star or a "Sputnick" crossing the sky. (U)
      (3) Bright white light, if standing still, would have looked like a star. (U)
      (4) One. (U)
      (5) N/A
      (6) None. (U)
      (7) None. (U)
      (8) None. (U)
      (9) Hover at the same speed as an artificial satellite, steady speed. (U)
