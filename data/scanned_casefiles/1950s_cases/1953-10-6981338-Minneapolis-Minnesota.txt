11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Three men, members of a white marker or yard at 40-5,800 ft, while working in 72 ft balloon at 72 psig & blowl, observed a white, circular object approx 30 secs at a rate of 10 deg/sec from NW to SE. Obj began vertical rise lasting about 15 secs, then descended vertically to ground level off a mile within a mile of General Mills Laboratory, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Fireball

One of the observers is a meteorological engineer and is considered to be completely reliable. The other two sources are also reliable. At the time of the sighting, no R-36 weather balloon was in the area. Sighting of Minneapolis at the time of observation was well lit but does not explain.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT

The sighting described below took place during the theodolite tracking of a 79 ft. balloon floating at approximately 80,000 ft. on Project 85021 - Crab Bag. Observation was made from the roof at 2003 East Hennepin Avenue.

The time was between 1010 and 1015 CST on 15 Oct. 53. No sound was detected at any time during the observation.

The object was first observed as it passed below the sun at an elevation of approximately 25° heading southwest in horizontal flight. It was detectable by a smoke or vapor trail which extended some distance behind it, but which did not persist, or form a cloud. The object itself was not visible even through the theodolite during the first part of the sighting.

During the horizontal part of its trajectory, the object moved across the sky at a rate of 10 degrees in 9 seconds. With an estimated altitude of 40,000 ft., this represents 15 miles per minute or 900 miles per hour.

After about 10 seconds of horizontal flight, the object appeared to go into a vertical dive. The possibility that the appearance of a dive was produced by the object merely receding into the distance seems unlikely. Since the speed from the line of sight was undiminished in the dive. The dive lasted for from 10 to 15 seconds at the end of which time the object was visible two or three times as it appeared to glow or reflect the light of the sun for perhaps a second or two. Just at this time the vapor trail ceased, and for a second or two thereafter the object, its outlines still unrecognizable, was seen through the theodolite, not as a glare of (reflected?) light, but as a gray mass in the act of leveling off. The size in the theodolite field was of the same magnitude as the 79 ft. balloon, which means that, since it was nearer, it would not be that large.

The observers believe that the object was most likely a jet aircraft, but several features were unusual.

1. The speed was higher than normally observed.
2. The vertical dive was a highly dangerous if not suicidal maneuver.
3. A jet aircraft in such a dive would be heard for miles, and would certainly cause a noticeable shock wave detectable in the area beneath it.
4. Vapor trails do not ordinarily occur during vertical motion (per Col. Shomo), though smoke trails could, of course.

It was thought that the Air Defense Command would be interested in what was seen, if:

a. They had no aircraft in the vicinity which could account for it, or if
b. They had an aircraft accident which might be partly explained by this report.

WHILE OBSERVING A BALLOON (ALT 7,000 FT) A WHITE TRAIL APPEARED IN THE SKY COMING FROM BEHIND PART OF THE BUILDING STRUCTURE (ROOF OF BLDG) IT FIRST APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT WISPY, BUT VELOCITY WAS TOO GREAT, SO WE ASSUMED IT TO BE A VAPOR TRAIL FROM A JET. THE END OF THE SMOKE TRAIL DISPERSED AS RAPIDLY AS THE BEGINNING WAS FORMED; THE LENGTH REMAINING ABOUT CONSTANT AND EQUAL TO ABOUT 5-8" IN AZIMUTH. AS TRAJECTORY STARTED DOWNWARD IT WAS AT FIRST ASSUMED THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AWAY FROM US, THEN THE VERTICAL MOVEMENT BECAME VERY RAPID, PROBABLY ABOUT AS FAST AS THE HORIZONTAL VELOCITY. AS THE OBJECT MOVED DOWNWARD, THE TRAIL BECAME LESS & LESS DISTINCT AND FINALLY, AS THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BEGIN LEVELING OUT, THE TRAIL DISSIPATED COMPLETELY. AT THE SAME TIME, TWO FLASHES WERE SEEN, WHICH WE ASSUMED TO BE REFLECTIONS FROM THE SUN AS THE OBJECT ROLLED ABOUT ITS LONGITUDINAL AXIS. THIS COULD BE EXPECTED FROM MANEUVERS IN A CONVENTIONAL CRAFT.

The Questionable Aspects Of The Sighting Were The Dissipation Of The Trail - Unknown For Vapor Trails; And The Apparent Speed, Especially Vertical Speed. Using The Elevation Angle (≃ 23°) And The Rate Of Angular Travel (About 1° Azimuth Per Sec.) Velocities Can Be Established By Assuming Different Attitudes Or Distances Away From The Object.

Under Assumptions From 30,000 Ft. To 30,000 Ft. Altitude, The Object Would Have Been Traveling Between 800 & 1600 M.P.H. Even Allowing A Considerable 20% Error The Object Was Probably Moving At Greater Than Sonic Velocity. Vertical Movement Of This Magnitude For 10-15 Sec. Would Probably Be Very Dangerous In Known Operational Aircraft.

On 12 Oct. 1953 while observing a high altitude balloon (altitude about 73,000 ft' alt' the line) a trail appeared about 5° below the balloon. Mr. [redacted] operated the theodolite, using the reply "right" while I looked through the instrument. After the initiating point of the trail appeared in the field, I assumed operation of the instrument, following the path by operating the mountain smooth & horizon controls on the instrument. Mr. [redacted] timed the rate of azimuth change. After the initiating point of the trail had gone well into the vertical phase of the trail I asked Mr. [redacted] to observe the object through the instrument. After leaving the instrument and observing with the naked eye, I noticed that the trail was rapidly dissipating, narrowing the possibility of the trail being long. In my opinion, the vertical portion of the trail also strengthens this opinion. I think.

AREA: FT. SNELLING, MINNESOTA         FROM: (Copany) Flt 2-A, 4602D AISS

TIMOTHY J DELANY, 2d Lt., USAF

REF: AFR 200-2, ATIC PHOTO EXCERPTS MANUAL, 25 July 1953

I. SUMMARY: An unidentified flying object was reported by three (3) 
research engineers employed by General Mills Aeronautical 
Laboratories. It was observed during the Geolulu tracking of a 79 
foot balloon over ST. PAUL at 73,000 feet between 1010S and 1015S 
15 October 1955.

The object was first observed as a comet-like smoke trail 
heading southward in horizontal flight passing below the sun which was 
at an elevation of approximately 25°. No sound was discernible during 
the entire observation. Object progressed in horizontal flight with an 
estimated altitude of 10,000 feet for approximately 20 seconds at the rate 
of 10° per 9 seconds. This represent 15 miles per minute or 900 miles 
per hour. (See chart I for variations on assumed altitude and speed.)

Object then began a vertical dive lasting 10 to 15 seconds. During 
this time it was visible several times appearing to glow. As object 
traveled from dive the smoke trails ceased and appeared as a gray mass 
through the theolite screen. The object then disappeared from view 
in a quick flash reminiscent of a mirror reflecting sunlight. SOURCES 
say that object appeared to be of the same magnitude in the theodolite 
field as the balloon which they were tracking.

II. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: All three men have extensive 
flying experience. Mr. [REDACTED] a Logical Engineer, Mr. [REDACTED] a 
North Aerodynamics, a private pilot, has 2 years post graduate 
work in Sansome Aerodynamics. Mr. [REDACTED] a Development Engineer, 
Mr. [REDACTED] made the entire observations with the naked eye while Mr. 
[REDACTED] observed the first portion of the flight through the theodolite.

What information has been obtained from SOURCES is believed 
to be completely reliable. The estimated altitude at which the smoke 
trails were observed leaves considerable room for speculation. Initial 
estimates were given in the vicinity of 40,000 feet but upon inquiry all

three men agreed that it could have been as high as 60,000 feet since
they could not accurately determine the altitude with the theodolite.
In addition to this fact they were unable to make a positive estimate
as to the depth of field from the observation post to where the object
was flying. These estimates were in relationship to known position
of the balloon.

III. CONTENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER: Review of source material reveals
initial sentence in paragraph two of this summary concerning elevation
of observation refers to the altitude which was 60,000 feet, sun.

The nearest ACSI facility to the point of this observation
was at the time of the observation inoperative however the logs of this
organization show two (2) 7-8-53 in the area south and west of Minneapolis
at this time. This information is in no way intended to definitely
correlate subject observation with these activities.
