UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT -

TO: DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE
U. S. AIR FORCE,
WASHINGTON, D. C.

1. Capt. [redacted], a member of the 516th Troop Carrier Wing, was interrogated by the undersigned staff officers of the same organization.

2. Capt. [redacted] was flying as co-pilot of flight No. 53 of Chicago and Southern Airlines which departed Memphis at 20:55 CST on 20 March 1950. destination Little Rock, Ark. The weather was CAVL and the flight was conducted VFR at 2000 feet. The visibility was 30 plus.

3. At 21:26, the Captain of the Airliner, Memphis, Tennessee, directed the attention of Capt. [redacted] to an unusual object flying at a tremendous speed approaching the airliner from the south on a north heading. Capt. [redacted] focused his attention on the object and both crew members observed the object as it passed in front of them, off/the right and out of sight. This observation took place over U. S. Highway #70 about 15 miles north of Stuttgart, Arkansas. The object was under observation for about 25 to 35 seconds. When the object passed directly in front of the airliner, the distance was not more than 1/2 mile and at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet higher than the airliner.

4. The object appeared to be circular with a diameter of approximately 100 feet horizontally with a vertical height between the top and bottom unknown but considerably less than the diameter giving the object a disk like shape. In the top center of the object was an extremely bright light blinking at an estimated 3 flashes per second. This light was so brilliant that it would have been impossible to look at it continuously had it not been flashing on and off rapidly. This light could be seen only when the object was approaching and after it had passed in front of the airliner.

In front of the observer, the bottom side of the object was visible. The bottom side appeared to have 9 to 12 symmetrical oval or circular porthole located in a circle approximately 3/4 of the distance from the center to the outer edge or rim. Through these portholes came a soft purple light. These lights were a shade of color similar to aircraft fluorescent lights. The object was not revolving or spinning and was traveling in a straight horizontal line of flight. Considering the visibility, the distance from the object, the length of time the object
