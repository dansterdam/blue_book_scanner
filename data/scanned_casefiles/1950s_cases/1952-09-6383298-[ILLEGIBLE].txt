1. The following article appeared in the 15 September 1952 edition of the Hong Kong "South China Morning Post":

FLYING SAUCERS REPORTED SEEN OVER HONG KONG
Taipei, 15 Sept.

A radio officer, whose hobby is the studying of electronics, said today that he had been able to view, in his own words, some 15 flying saucers.

The informant, who asked that his name be withheld, added that the flying objects appeared over Hong Kong at 1:45 a.m. on Saturday.

He said that they passed over the Colony toward the southeast in an "arc" formation. Their size were three times as big as a star. Light was fluorescent and the altitude could not be estimated, but while on their way, the objects passed into a small cloud and light was seen through the cloud.

The informant said that he did not immediately report to the authorities, as he did not wish to be delayed in his trip to Taiwan. However, on his return to Hong Kong next Thursday, he would get in touch with the Royal Observatory there.

This is the first time that reports have been made of flying saucers in Hong Kong.

2. COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:

The Hong Kong weather at 0200 local time 15 September (121700Z) was "overcast with continuous light rain."

The time of the alleged incident, 1:45 a.m. Hong Kong time, 15 September 1952, is 121645Z.

The person who made this report is so far unknown to this office. Further information will be reported if it becomes available.
