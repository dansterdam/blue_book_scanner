10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A brilliant white flare coming up through
undercast observed from a/c at 8,000 ft.
A/c dispatched to investigate 1 hr later.
Located 4 surface vessels in area. Pilot
observed powerful rotating white beacon at
St. Pierre on Nova Scotia coast line.
Additional information upon landing indicated
that flare was rocket type with tail in flight
through overcast. Believed to be over 40 mi
away.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☒ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other:
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

11. COMMENTS
Pilot of investigating a/c was of
opinion that beacon from St. Pierre may
have appeared over edge of overcast
and been mistaken of observer for a
flare. INSUFFICIENT DATA to substantiate
this conclusion since personnel witness
stated that flare came up through
the overcast. Descending upon landing
indicates that object more probably
a meteor. Flight direction is West.

1. On 3 November 1951, at ~0652, B-29 #542, on route from Argentina, Newfoundland, to Patuxent River, Maryland, at an altitude of 20,000 feet, encountered a brilliant white flare which came up through an undercast. Location of the sighting was at 47° 00' N, 57° 35' W, approximately 60 miles due east of St. Pierre, Newfoundland. Pilot, A French passenger 100 miles south Gander Newfoundland.

2. Gander Airport advised that no other aircraft except the B-29 was in the area at the time of sighting. Halifax noted that no RCAF aircraft were in the area at the time of sighting; and the US Coast Guard at Argentia Naval Station reported that no aircraft or surface vessels were under their control in the area at the time of sighting.

3. Flight B-10 #4058 was dispatched and reached the area of sighting at 0122. A search of the area was made at an altitude of 5,000 feet. (Further details was not made due to a second incident described further in this report). Two pilots, Captain Harold S. Ailing, reported the area called "Twilight Valley", and with an undercast lying to the south. An estimated four surface vessels were sighted in the area, all approximately 15 miles apart. All appeared to be small fishing boats. A powerful rotating white beacon was visible at St. Pierre and lights on the Nova Scotia coast, over Cape Breton, were plainly seen. The pilot's opinion was that the St. Pierre beacon may have served over the edge of the undercast and had been mistaken by the B-29 pilot for a flare.

4. Both the pilot and co-pilot overheard heavy WG traffic on "D" channel and, though unable to identify its significance, afterward, were convinced that some sort of 1942 formation of aircraft were near the area. Voices were described as being unsteadily American.

5. To clarify this incident further, a message was forwarded to the Intelligence Officer at the Patuxent Naval Air Station, Maryland, requesting that the crew of the B-29 be carefully interviewed, with the following message was received in response to this request:

b. SL-19 #2058 was tentatively diverted to the area and arrived at 0430.

c. The conditions on the island were fairly well outlined. A small flight crew was taken
visible on an off-shore island. The pilot, however, expressed doubt as to
possible use. An exchange of information was made with the crew of PB4Y-2 Pos. No
low expressed doubt that it could have been mistaken for a flare. A low report was
made and was recalled.

d. The overall evaluation of the investigation by Captain Kuhn was that the
extreme visibility, combined with the extreme surface conditions of unobscured areas,
would tend to eliminate other than normal explanation of pilot.

e. The U.S. Coast Guard at Argentia advises that flares are utilized by rescue
vessels only in cases of distress or emergency.
