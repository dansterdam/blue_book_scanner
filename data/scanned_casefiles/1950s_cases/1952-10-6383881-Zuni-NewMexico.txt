In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [redacted]

DATE: 5 NOV 1952

OBSERVATION MADE FROM AIRCRAFT SEPT OF INTEL OBJECT APPEARED WEST OF OUR AIRCRAFT AT 9:12 TIMES. THREE TYPES OF MANEUVERS OBSERVED: ALT. CHANGE, HOVER, RAPID HORIZONTAL SPEED, ALT. CHANGE FROM ESTIMATED 30,000 FT. F ESTIMATED 60,000 FT. OBJECT APPEARED TO HOVER MOST OF TIME. HORIZONTAL SPEED ESTIMATED AS HIGH AS 2000 MPH. TWO BLINKING LIGHTS (RED) DIRECTLY ABOVE MAIN SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION REMAINED IN FIXED RELATIVE POSITIONS IN HORIZONTAL PLANE, BRIGHT LIGHT RESEMBLING 50% OR BEACON APPEARED OCCASIONALLY, GIVING IMPRESSION OF TURNING OF MAIN BODY AROUND VERTICAL AXIS. DISTANCE OF OBJECT FROM OUR AIRCRAFT RANGED FROM ESTIMATED 50 MILES TO ESTIMATED 500 MILES. OBJECT FIRST OBSERVED AT ESTIMATED 30,000 FT., BEARING ESTIMATED 30° FROM OUR HEADING AND EXTENDED TO BE NEARING AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES IT STARTED MOVING ON A NEW COURSE, STOPPING AT HIGHER ALT. AND AT A GREATER DISTANCE BEARING ABOUT 30° FROM OUR HEADING. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES IT APPEARED TO BEGIN MOVING ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH OUR AIRCRAFT, BUT QUICKLY TURNED AWAY ON A NEW COURSE. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THE STRONG BEACON OR SPOT LIGHT WAS ON.


- page 8 -

Here is the text from the document:

MOST CLEARLY NOTICED. ALL OF THE ABOVE MANGLERS WERE REPEATED BEFORE THE OBJECT WAS FINALLY LOST FROM VIEW ON THE HORIZON MANY HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY (ESTIMATED).

THERE IS NO DOUBT WHATEVER IN MY MIND ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF MANY OF MY OBSERVATIONS. HOWEVER, DISTANCES, SIZE AND SPEEDS ARE STRICTLY GUESSES WITHOUT ADEQUATE REFERENCES TO ASSURE THEIR ACCURACY.

THIS OBSERVATION WARRANTS THE MOST CAREFUL ATTENTION OF THE AIR FORCE, AND UNLIMITED EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND IDENTITY OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED.

I AM NOT ABLE TO DISMISS IT AS A NATURAL PHENOMENON. I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SKEPTICAL AND UNCONVINCED ABOUT SUCH REPORTS PREVIOUSLY. CERTAIN OF MY OBSERVATIONS WERE POSITIVE AND VERIFIED BY TWO OTHER AIR FORCE PILOTS.

Some geographical feature names (though many are too small to read clearly)

The map has multiple diagonal lines drawn across it, with some areas shaded in darker tones. The map is in black and white and appears to be from a vintage document, likely part of a geographical or military report.

1. Reference is made to Air Force Letter No. 200-5, Department of the Air Force, dated 29 April 1952.

2. The following is forwarded for your information and dissemination:

On 15 October 1952, at approximately 1900 hours, Mr. [redacted] of Brooklyn, New York, telephonically reported to this office that he had been on the roof top of his apartment building watching searchlights which had been moving from south to north across the sky. He suddenly noticed two strange objects to the east and to the west which appeared to be stationary. The objects were a bright blue color and gradually changed to a pinkish orange color and then back again to bright blue. There was no twinkling effect noted off by the lights. Mr. [redacted] felt certain they could not have been stars. He was watching the objects through his field glasses which have approximately an eight-inch range. The object to the east was low in the sky and the one to the west was quite high in the sky. Mr. [redacted] stated that apparently someone was trying to put the spotlight on the objects only to run up the searchlight miles which were crossing the sky. Mr. [redacted] emphasized that the objects gave off a bright light. He estimated that they turned for approximately eighteen minutes. Because of this, he felt they could not possibly have been a flare as flares ordinarily do not burn that long and also they did not fall from the sky in any way. The objects suddenly came extinguished and at that point Mr. [redacted] came down to his apartment to call our office.

1. Reference is made to AF Letter 200-5, Headquarters, Department of the Air Force, dated 29 April 1952.

2. The following is forwarded for your information and dissemination:

[Redacted name] of Colliers Magazine, who resides at [redacted location] New York City, New York, telephonically reported to this office that he had observed a large bright light at approximately 1820 hours on 14 October 1952, while he was on the roof of the six (6) story apartment house in which he resides, and stated that he was no judge of distance or height but the flame appeared as a great distance and height south along the East River. The apartment house is on the corner of [redacted].

The flame or light appeared to be cylinders in shape and gave off a steely orange and red light with an occasional flicker of blue flame. [Redacted] added that the flame or light did not appear to be one which was discharged from a blister, for example a blow torch. This light moved very slowly in a direction generally from east to west for approximately one (1) minute and then disappeared while moving in a general direction of south-southeast (SSE) at a great speed which took place in approximately one-half (1/2) minute. No further description could be given concerning the appearance of the flame.

[Redacted] stated that he decided to report his observation after reading an article that appeared in the New York Times, newspaper, 15 October 1952 issue, page 31, titled "FLYING SAUCER OVER ILLINOIS". This article is stated verbatim as follows:

Ltr to HQ OSI, Subject: FLYOBSPT - SPECIAL INQUIRY

"BIG FLAME" REPORTED
SEEN OVER IDLEWILD

A big blue flame that reportedly passed over New York International Airport, Idlewild, Queens, at 7:33 o'clock last night mystified airport personnel.

The phenomenon was said to have been observed by the pilot of a plane about to take off, a pilot about to land, control tower personnel and some mechanics at the field.

The control tower men, who are employees of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, said they had made a report to their superiors and the a 'release' may be issued today by the C.A.A. office at the airport. They declined to describe what they had seen.

It was learned that the 'flame' was reportedly seen traveling from east to west over the airport, and that it had no particular shape. The pilot of a plane about to take off for Buffalo was talking to the tower at the time and asked the operators if they saw the 'flame'. One replied that he had and at the request of the pilot made a record of the incident.

A spokesman for C.A.A. said later that a controller in the tower reported he had seen an object moving at a very high speed across the field, at approximately 1,000 feet, and that the object seemed to have disappeared off the periphery of the airport. In accordance with procedure, he notified Mitchell Field military authorities.

Dear [redacted]

The enclosed report of an unidentified object has been presented to me with an unusual degree of fervor by the author. He states that up until the time he saw the damned thing he was an unalloyed sceptic, but that now he is a thorough-going convert.

His qualifications for unbiased observation are considerably higher than most people's. He further makes the point that he had co-observers with qualifications and prior attitudes similar to his.

14 Oct. 53 Sighting Norde by Col. [redacted]:

It's far as ascertained possibilities go to explain this sighting, when the first note Sighting could produce, two briefly states, were about an effort to the 14th path, the distinct movement of the object if not inside a mile. I flight time.

Believe were here with from Albuquerque, N.M. and were draw Horizon at 0308 & 1 hr. and 50 minutes prior to Col's sighting would by that time both believe would have been out. There is only possibility that an apple can produce balloon might have been in the area and this will have to be checked.

The mile seems to prevent the most plausible answer at the present time and a check is being made on airline and his route flights existed in the area flying the range between Zuni and Windslow, Arizona.
