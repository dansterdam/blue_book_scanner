    1. Synopsis: At 2245 hours on 8 January 1951, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] of Waco, Texas, while driving from Fort Worth, Texas to Waco, Texas, observed several groups of strange lights in the sky at an altitude of 1000 feet. (CGI-7-0)

    2. Details: On 12 January 1951, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] were interviewed at their residence at 103 Victory Drive, Waco, Texas and stated as follows:

    "We were returning from Fort Worth, Texas, at approximately 10:45 p.m., 8 January 1951. After leaving the super highway coming out of Fort Worth and entering U. S. Highway 81, we drove over a slight hill approximately five to eight miles south of the intersection of U. S. Highway 81 and U. S. Highway 81. As we crossed the top of the hill, we saw a series of lights in the sky and at first it appeared to be a water tower or a radio tower. Then I looked to the right and to the left and saw other bunches of lights identical to the ones over the highway.

    "We pulled over to the side of the road and stopped. We noticed approximately 200 yards ahead of us two other automobiles which had pulled off to the side of the highway, apparently to watch the same lights we were observing. We pulled our car up behind these other two cars, at which time one car drove off.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
