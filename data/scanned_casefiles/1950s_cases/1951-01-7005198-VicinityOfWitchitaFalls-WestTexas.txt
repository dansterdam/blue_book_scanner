1. Synopsis: At 2245 hours on 5 January 1951, Mr. and Mrs.
of Waco, Texas, while driving from Port Worth, Texas to Waco, observed several groups of strange lights in the sky at an altitude of 1000 feet. (GIST-00)
2. Details: On 12 January 1951, Mr. and Mrs. were interviewed at 103 Victory Drive, Waco, Texas and stated as follows:
They were returning from Port Worth, Texas, at approximately 10:42 P.M., 5 January 1951, after leaving the super highway coming out of Port Worth and entering it 13 miles south. As they proceeded along this highway, they observed a series of lights in the sky south of the intersection of the super highway and U.S. Highway 81. As we closed the top of the hill, we saw a series of lights in the sky and as first it appeared to be a waterhouse. On drawing closer, we noticed that the light had increased in size and intensity. We continued to observe the lights, approximately 200 yards ahead of us two other lights materialized, apparently to match the ones already seen. As we drew nearer these lights, they joined together becoming one car toward the horizon.
DOWNGRATED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
