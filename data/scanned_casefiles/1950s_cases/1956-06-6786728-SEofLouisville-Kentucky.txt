34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 20 Feb 1959

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object appeared to be about 150-200 feet in diameter, and was approximately 2000-3000 feet in altitude, moving from north to south, over the area southeast of Louisville, Kentucky. The object appeared to be disc-shaped and had a bright, shiny metallic surface. It moved at a very rapid rate of speed, and was observed for about 30 seconds. The object seemed to slow down, hover, and then accelerate and disappear from sight. This is my best estimate from visual observation. The night was clear, and I saw the object quite plainly. I have observed many aircraft in flight, and this was definitely not any conventional aircraft. I am an airline pilot and have had considerable experience in identifying aircraft in flight. I am convinced that this was an unidentified flying object of some kind.

Went through the country around outside the city it remained in sight for about 7 or 8 minutes and then it seemed obscured by buildings. As it went along it seemed to give off a glow. It appeared to me as a single solid lighted object as big as Jupiter.

What could it be. I have never seen anything like it before. It moved in a straight line without any erratic course changes. I have considered meteors, satellites, balloons, and all the known type of lights, but his does not seem to fit any of them.

The time was about 10:30 PM. The weather was clear and calm, no wind. There were a few scattered clouds around but never near the object. It moved about the speed of an airliner or jet. 

From your description and what I know of these incidents, I must say that this is a most interesting sighting. Unfortunately there is no photograph to support the report. But there are many reliable witnesses who have reported similar types of phenomena. Most of these cases remain unidentified and unexplained according to our present knowledge.

I hope you will be able to obtain further information on this sighting. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist in this investigation.

Sincerely yours,
George Gorman

CONCLUSIONS IN BRAZIL
So far four people hove claimed to hove contacted entities from other worlds and the only the 2 ores contacts mentioned by Prof. WATTLESTONE, who are well known to us. We hove sbriddged the stories of N.A.C.A. and PROF. WELKER,in order to show the truth, as we understand them. We will try to avoid any general cases" and 'the dumbness case" like the two former cases mentioned. However, we do not believe that these contactees are really truthful, we would find it extremely difficult to tell themselves why they hove lied. We are inclined to believe that it is a delirious experience without eny real foundation or possibly it may be just an experiment to make money or to become known.
POSSIBLE CAUSE: Many stories Just likè to listen to his vivid tale. 
RESULT: Those who seem to make money or be known by them
Hallucinations: Hallucination, Does she not want to write a book, reaches love and idea.how mail" and ideals have written books. Most has seiply said that the Sees intands to write some more books about saucers. At the bottom he is amusing himself hugely.
SIMEONE 30: He said that the thing will bo the biggest thing in ine history, but do not deal with; Headlive not only in Brazil but also in Europe. We are herein conveying first hand information as to something hoster, Because in School of Santos: he is president of the Lawyers Associations he is Chairman for Special Committee on Ufos.
That was the chairman of the Lawyers Asscelation last we heard; it was not connected for a good cause. About the chairman the story has been connected for a good cause
The subject the Chairman case has been connected so they have written extensively to Ltz D. Ephoena, Vice President of Civilian Saucer Investigation of New york, 235 west 104th street -Newyork• Apparently, "Ltz D. Ephoene" received a letter from chairman and are informed that the long story be printed, we reprint it partly:
"I must make an obseroation. In the letter Alexander D. McKane of GSI of New York state that I think about it, but since I am sure that it is another hoax and that the long story bridged, we reprint it partly.
"It seems that flying saucers got fed up with so much visiting dalta in the Argentina and other latin american countries and that is the strange objects have been plaguing Brazil with their sudden appearances and disappearances that have puzzled Drszilian scientists. However, it is not only Brazil but other countries in South America which have now reached what could be termed as a peak to our standards.
"to generally speaking, now—a-days, such attraction as to common sight things, which are observed not only in Brazil but more other South American countries .21/9/55-27,."

But when someone claims to have made contact with beings from other worlds, then things become quite different and serious, even if ostensibly so, get first page treatment.

On August 15, 1957, practically all newspapers in Sao Paulo published the story of a Mr. Amadeu Guilherme da Silva, a farmer living near Bauru, Brazil, who claimed to have been in contact with beings from another world. The incident happened as follows:

On that date, Guilherme was working in his cornfield when he noticed a strange object descending from the sky nearby. It was metallic, about 4 meters in diameter and 3 meters high, resting on three "telescopic-like" landing gears. Guilherme approached the object and saw two human-like beings, about 1.50 meters high, with yellowish skin, dressed in tight-fitting silvery outfits. They seemed to be making adjustments on the exterior of the object. Guilherma tried to speak to them, but they did not answer. Instead, one of the beings raised his hand and Guilherme felt a strange sensation, as though he was paralyzed. Suddenly, the beings re-entered the object, the landing gears retracted, and the object took off rapidly, disappearing into the sky.

Soon afterwards, Guilherme's story was confirmed by two other witnesses, who claimed to have seen the same object and the two beings. The incident received wide publicity in the Brazilian press and was reported in many parts of the world. Guilherme was interviewed by various newspapers and his story was considered credible by most of the reporters.

The trip lasted for 40 minutes and the craft landed about 60 meters from the witnesses. The author started vibrating and Guilherme rather afraid asked one of the witnesses if he had felt the same thing. The author got out of the craft and approached the witnesses, and Guilherme could see that they had passed a very dark zone "cloudy" with stars and flaming clouds and were now approaching a dome-like object in the distance. When the author returned to the craft, the dome-like object began to emit a bluish light, which according to the witnesses meant that the author had been in communication with those inside. When the author re-entered the craft, the craft took off rapidly, disappearing in the distance.

Analyzing reporters' questions, Guilherme said that these were five people watching the scene. The craft's outer surface seemed very fragile, and the witnesses were afraid to get too close. It was difficult to say whether they were men or women.

TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

Guess and the answers were always telepathic. They had come on a mission of investigation. Several times the newspapers had received messages that such and such saucers had crashed near Louisville, but they had not made good his word because someone belonging to his family had died the day before. It was known that in July 1952 the newspapers had agreed not to tell where they knew anything about his adventure, and that's why on August 12, 1957 the newspapers now started disclosing the story.

The flying saucers were working on remote control from some place and the captain or the ship rotates contrary wise; this producing "strangulation" and maneuvering. On the saucer, there was a small window about two feet in diameter in the center and also around the edge, spaced evenly, were several view ports or special devices on the top of the dome and around the outer rim of the saucer.
Off and on as currents would be picked up, the ports would open and close. As I looked inside the ship there was only one instrument. It was a circle like in a gyroscope and it was running funny. Wherever the saucer went, this instrument guided it.

This is the close up drawn by professor Guimaraes.

On August 14th, TV Channel 3 had advertised, would present Guimaraes between 12:00 to 1:00. TV Channel 3, what announced, was a "FLYING SAUCER" story. It was agreed that the story would not tell where the saucer had been found. Guimaraes had repeated the whole story. It was agreed that the story would not mention about $5,000 that Guimaraes had been offered to buy his silence.

I tried in vain to talk to Guimaraes privately but the crowd of curious people were so great that I could not get to him. Some men with me were my wife, Dr. Marie Cuatra Godinho and Dr. Jayme Vassis the former Governor's Secretary. After our trip began, we all were sure that Mr. Guimaraes should be foggy minutes after our trip began, we all were sure that Mr. Guimaraes should have some means of transportation or communication other than with us. He said he had never read a book about saucers, nevertheless he suddenly mentioned things that led us to believe his story.

I said to myself that whatever I discovered about Guimaraes, I would not harm him in any way, as I am aware of their motives. Indeed, I felt privileged to have seen the luminosities of several related layers; these layers are responsible for the peculiar effects on certain people.  While we are worrying about our scientific misgivings, people from other worlds are wiser, more powerful and as mystical as the luminosities of several joined layers. I told him [Guimaraes] that even if what he showed us was a hoax, I would never expose him, because he had the moral courage to invent a story that could hold water.

on behalf of mankind welfare and that - Guimaraes had done the same thing for the same good purposes. I emphasized that some lies are worth telling, like the lie that Guimaraes had done the same things, but is does not contain the truth because the conversation Guimaraes had maintained with the crew-members - he told her that the things he reported he could not reproduce. She reported to me that she had never heard Guimaraes say this and that he seemed to be unable to reproduce his own conversation with the crew. I asked Guimaraes about this and he offered some cover-up and evasions of the offer, but I insisted that I was not satisfied with his answers. He then tried to tell me that if he did - he said - he would not be believed or would be taken in as a lunatic. I thought 1956 some prospects called to certain that inferences should not be - the contacts they had reasons he admitted to me, and that it had none of the reasons why you were stabilized and that in my opinion far more publicity going against was publicity. Then they came, over towards the incoming house, a show that would take place on the following night. Then they went, and would also use a few tricks, he had only laughs at him.

mean the earth from a distance: the papers - he said - had distorted his tale. distorted too much. He was recalling the incident of more than an hour before when he had gone to show the photographs of saucers he had obtained from. (trace yourselves) the pentagonal photographs of saucers he had obtained from his relatives, for examination and study by the Air Force. It was said Guimaraes had an appointment to meet the key people on last August 15: when we took him to Santon with his wife. He was a well-educated man: nevertheless, he had an appointment for some day in August 1957. It was not sure of the date it had been held. Guimaraes said that although people from other worlds are far more advanced and advanced "physical individuals" in comparison with the masters and masters because governments are not cooperative, they select simple people like us to contact.

a Guimaraes came to the investigation followed by most of his students. who brought a petition signed by all participants. The investigators indicated to me that Guimaraes led to the process, which was a surprise, because the people who were unknown to Guimaraes. Meanwhile the crowd one of the announcers said the body was found in a field: 30 meters high and 6 meters wide. He told them that Joro leskio. leskio said he was a contractor dealer in Santon. Many months ago, when speaking to his friends about his fighting but nobody said much attention - He was laughed when telling them how the loco had picked him. Luckily they dismissed it, when they realized that Guimaraes - the joker - had also seen his saucer and even had learned that Guimaraes was the joker and even had the pictures had kept from the emperor had sent down the science of the empire. Guimaraes was in San Sebastian, Persia, had gone to that place to watch the coming eclipse on August 12. In San Sebastian, Persia, he had met people who have told him about his planned trip. One of his nephew's he searched almost all because for Guimaraes. of a wart driver and two of his nephews he searched almost all because for Guimaraes. Everything got nearer quickly causing the drive and one of his nephews to flee shamelessly. He said that was screaming it light and other it bended over. Mr. Versalles realized that the saucer had made good use of some guarantees of coming back after 1.5 years. After a week, the saucer went back round.

ited that very far on another beach there were car lights and flash lights, pro- bably from persons who had come so far to see something. He went hastily back to his island, but apparently they did not come there in any space saucer had not come. Pereira told them about what he had seen on the other side of the mountain. Inland, but apparently nobody believed him. He spoke to at least four reporters.
He was advised to stay overnight in Sao Sebastian. On the following morning, he went to the Ilha Bela - a big island about three miles from Sao Sebastian - to see the strange figures 30 Silo (well above the sound of a cathedral bell when hit with another stone. Some reporters and photographers who on the previous evening had come to Ilha Bela, came to him Bela to question him about what they had seen on the island. When an Ilha Bela City Hall representative entered the restaurant and started questioning him about a Saucer he had seen, he spoke at about 22:15 6 clock local time (01:15 GMT) flying around the island. According to reports, his description tallied with what he had seen at 22:15 (01:15 GMT).
Pereira named about ten witnesses who independently saw the saucer on August 12 or 13. The individuals in question, Pereira said, he had seen a saucer. The saucer car apparently did not believe Ger. Pereira, but he was not identified and could argue whether he actually talked to them. The saucer, Pereira said, was about 30 meters wide and hovered at about 25-30 meters above the ground.
Guimaraes was unable to tell whether the saucer was metallic or not. The individuals concerned stated that the saucer was metallic, but Guimaraes evaded almost all questions put by various investigators who soon learned that the publicity or personality was due to his high position, this however, meant nothing in this case. The best advice is to ignore Guimaraes's contact.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
17 June 1956
Cincinnati, OHIO

1. Case 162. Cincinnati, 17 June 1956 - The following is the report to CRIFOR by a member of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society, who watched the strange object with several other observers. According to the report, he was awakened, watched the strange object through an open window. At first it was a stationary, silent brilliant spot in the northwest sky, about 15 degrees above the horizon. Then it seemed to move closer, and without declining in brilliance, it became almost twice the size of the moon, was fiery red and shaped like a bowl facing downwards. Dangling from the bottom were bright red streamers. In view for about 10 minutes, the object then returned rapidly, becoming a pinpoint of light, then disappeared. On request of the observer, the witnesses watched the same area the next night, but saw nothing.

2. Next is the dangling red streamers which bears similarity to "streams of light streaming downward" described by in Case 162. Another point, no other person reported the dangling streamers as an indication of tremendous size. Such would indicate that the object was armed and was a test of some device, perhaps for new weapons or Satellites being developed. Written per field survey.
CRIFOR would have heard.

No Case (Information Only)

29 June - July 30 1956
Yonkers, New York

Case: The Herald-Statesman of Yonkers, July 3, said, "Skyvatchers report thrilling post-midnight sight..." It is of orange color, more nearly red. To one with a go-power telescope, it appears to be round, than oval. It was moving at what seemed to be a fast speed. The phenomenon was noted after 1 a.m. on Saturday. Another report tells of the orange-red color moving around the skies near or a little later just ahead of the rain. The remainder of the newspapers item gibbered in ridicule, a letter received from XX Yonkers, describes his observations in more detail. Said,

"... I phoned the Herald-Statesman and spoke to Ossie Reisler, who seemed describing my sighting. He asked, "You saw it, too?" I said yes. I told him I didn't know anyone else saw anything and not to use my name if he used the story.  

On the night of June 22, at about 11:40 p.m. there was a bright orange-red light moving around the sky. It seemed to be about 500 feet up. It moved erratically, then hovered for a while, then suddenly shot away to the south at a tremendous speed and was gone. There were others there, too, who saw it But I didn't know them. About 12:15 a.m. on June 23rd, the same or a similar object appeared again, only this time it seemed to be about 1,000 feet up. It hovered for a while and then shot away to the west at a terrific speed and was gone. 

Then, on the night of June 22nd at about 12:20 a.m. Mrs. X and I were sitting on the back porch about 10:30 p.m. and saw another object coming from the north. It was moving directly overhead. It seemed to be round or oval and had a reddish-orange color. It moved rapidly across the sky and then stopped and hovered. Then it suddenly shot away to the west and was gone in a flash. I don't know what these things are, but they are something quite different from anything I've ever seen before. They are extremely hard to keep in view due to their accelerating speed. I checked it for 15 seconds and when I returned to the house my wife said "There, it went!"
