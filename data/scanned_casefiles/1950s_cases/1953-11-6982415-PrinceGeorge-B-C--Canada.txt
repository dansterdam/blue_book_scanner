NORTH PACIFIC

Hydrographic Bulletin

METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. Mariners reporting their observations of these bodies are greatly assisting in this work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of occurrence and clear parameters as accurate as possible, either by bearing and altitude or by relation to fixed stars, or both.

Complete observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift are of especial importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

NORTH PACIFIC

Chief Officer D. A. Davis, of the American M.V. Jumper Hitch, reports the following meteor observation:

At 0440 L. C. T. November 8, 1953, in lat. 38°50' N., lon. 124°57' E., a very brilliant meteor was observed travelling in a southeast-erly direction very near the zenith. Heavy cirro-stratus overcast at the time, so the tail or arc was not observed, but about 4 seconds before the main body burned out several large pieces seemed to fall away.

Weather overcast, wind NE. force 2; barometer 30.09 inches; air temperature 57° F.
