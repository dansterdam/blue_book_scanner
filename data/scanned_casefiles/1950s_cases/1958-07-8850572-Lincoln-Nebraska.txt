MEMO FOR RECORD                                                   21 March 1960

Mrs. of Indianapolis, Ind. called to inform Major Friend that she had in her possession a movie film taken 11 July 1958, of a UFO which could possibly shed some light on the Northwest Airlines accident of 17 March 1960. Mrs. said that she had not reported the film earlier because she did not want any undesirable publicity, her husband was against it, and she did not know to what agency to make the report.

Mrs. requested that her husband not be informed of this contact with the Air Force. Maj Friend was asked to visit her home in Indianapolis for the purpose of getting this film. Mrs. said that she would rather not mail it for fear of her husband learning of the transaction. Mrs. also requested that she receive no publicity as a result of this call or the film.

The informant further stated that the Indianapolis Star of this morning (21 March 60) carried a story stating that the left and right wings of the ill-fated Northwestern Airliner had appeared to hit something prior to the explosion. Mrs. contacted Mr. of the Aviation Safety District Office and he advised her to report the information to ATIC.

Mrs. is employed in the audit division of the State Employment Security Office. Her address is, Indianapolis, Ind., Telephone

Maj Friend contacted Mr. of the FAA in Indianapolis and passed to him the above information. Mr. advised that a memo to the Civil Aeronautics Board at Cicero, Ill. would be appropriate follow-up action.

MEMO FOR RECORD                                                  21 March 1960

Mr. [redacted], Channel Newscaster, Evansville, Ind., called and informed Maj Friend that he had been advised by a representative of the Aerial Phenomena Research Group of Seattle, Wash. that a UFO was observed in the Evansville area on 17 March 1960. Mr. [redacted] wanted Air Force confirmation of the sighting. He was advised that the Air Force had no record of a sighting on 17 March.

It is interesting to note that 17 March is the date of the Northwest Airline disaster in the Evansville area. Cause for this accident has as yet been undetermined. It is possible that the APRG wishes to attribute this accident to a UFO.

TRIP REPORT

Name of Traveler:    Friend, Robert J.
                     Major, USAF
                     AFCIN-LG2
                     Aerial Phenomena Group

Date of Trip:        22 March 1960

Place, Name, Location:   Indianapolis, Ind.

When Contacted:      21 March 1960

Reason:   1. Mrs. [redacted] of Indianapolis, Ind. called ATIC and
informed Major Friend that she had in her possession a movie
film taken 11 July 1958, which could possibly shed some light
on the Northwestern Airlines accident of 17 March 1960.
Mentioned that the film was of an unidentified flying
object flying near an Air Force aircraft near Lincoln, Nebraska.
It was requested of her that she forward the film to ATIC
for analysis, but she declined to do so indicating that she
wanted specific contact with the individual receiving the film.

Results:  1. On 22 March 1960, Major Friend of AFCIN-LG2, Aerial
Phenomena Group, visited Mrs [redacted] at her home in Indianapolis.
Mrs [redacted] prior to discussing or surrendering the film,
cautioned Major Friend that she wanted no publicity or
connection with this case whatever. She especially cautioned
against her husband being made aware of this contact. The
film was viewed in the home of Mrs [redacted] her request, and
while it showed a light near an aircraft, which may have been a
reflection, the projection was too small for any positive
identification. Mrs [redacted] when queried as to why she had
not turned this film over to the Air Force earlier, confessed
that it was due to her husband's ridicule of her impressions,
the lack of desire for publicity, and ignorance as to what
agency within the Air Force to contact. She further stated,
however, that in view of the Northwestern Airlines tragedy of
17 March that she felt it her duty to surrender this film to
the Air Force in an effort to help determine the cause of the
aircraft accident.

2. Mrs [redacted] presently is employed by the Audit Division of
the State Employment Security Office. However, it was determined
that she was on sick leave as a result of a near nervous break-
down. Mrs [redacted] is 47 years old, appeared very energetic and
intelligent, but very enthusiastic in her discussion of UFOs.

3. Mrs [redacted] claimed that the fact that a wing of the ill-
fated aircraft was recently found some distance away from the
main scene of the crash confirms her belief that it was sheared
off by a mid-air collision with some other type of craft. Contact
was made with Mr [redacted] of the FAA of Indianapolis, who confirmed


- page 6 -

the fact that the aircraft wing was found some distance from the main crash area and although as yet unofficial, it is believed that this was the first incident in this air tragedy, but was the, however, to structural failure through on by turbulence.
The film strip was brought back to ATIC by Major Friend and has been turned over to 404 for analysis.

Comments:
This is not the first incident in which air tragedy has been attributed to collision with UFO. Most notable instance of such connection was with the disintegration of British Comets (determined to be a result of structural failure).

The FAA at Indianapolis, and the Civil Aeronautics Board at Chicago, Ill. have been provided with the information contained in this report.

Memo, AFCIN-452, 23 Mar 60, "UFO Film" (MR Francis Luzmar)
1st Ind (AFCIN-4D4)                                   28 March 1960

TO:   AFCIN-452

1. The attached motion picture was carefully reviewed, but
we were unable to locate any unidentified flying objects.
Throughout the film, however, there are bright spots of
varying shapes and intensities that were undoubtedly caused
by reflections of and on various objects on and within the
automobile in which the photographer was riding. Unfortuntely it is only too common to have light bouncing around
inside a lens system when a camera is used on a bright sunshining day. We believe the photographer has mistaken these
defects in the photography caused by excessive reflected
light for a UFO.

2. A copy of the film was not made. It is suggested that the
original be returned to the sender.
