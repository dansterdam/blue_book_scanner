Mr. [redacted]
Supervisor - Plant Security
and Investigations
General Electric Company
Evendale, Ohio

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

We are in receipt of a very brief report concerning some unidentified object in possession of Mr. [redacted], an employee of the General Electric Company. A copy of the report is attached.

It would be appreciated if you can arrange to have some photographs taken of this item, together with a more detailed report, and forward to this Center. Exact location and the circumstances under which the object was found is particularly desirable.

Identification is often made through study of photographs. In the interest of government economy and expediency, this will preclude initiating an investigation, placing investigative personnel on orders to interrogate the source and conducting field examinations.

This action is requested in accordance with paragraph 40, AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 1958, copy attached. Your assistance and cooperation in this matter would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

H. K. GILBERT
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Science

MEMO TO THE FILE

SUBJECT: CASE #L562-227                                                   June 6, 1958

On June 2, 1958, [redacted] a worker in the PED Machine Parts Grinding room at column D-8, building 800, under foreman [redacted], extension [redacted], who lives at Bethel, Ohio, reported the following:

On about April 7, 1958 his father, [redacted], who lives at Cuzick, Ky., which is about 12 miles south of Richmond, observed a fliary object fall from the skies and land on his farm. The next day he found an object cone-shaped and resembling the nose of a missile, along with what he described as tape. Kind of quality unknown. [redacted] visited his father on May 30, 1958 and after a discussion on the subject of the "thing", he brought it to his home at Bethel, Ohio and subsequently reported it to this office. Also on June 2, this office, Cincinnati Mr. [redacted] of the Cincinnati FBI office. The FBI subsequently turned the case over to the Air Force. On 6 June 1958 Agent Phillips of the OSI Cincinnati office visited this office and was given information pertinent to the case. Further, this office offered to assist the OSI in any way possible. Apparently the Cincinnati office will report the case to DO-5 at WAFB for further action. This will conclude our activities in the case unless requested to continue by the Air Force.
