1. Attached herewith are two cans of radar scope film, and one roll of trans-
parent map overlays.

2. A check of the film indicates the presence of ground and sea targets (ships
and sea clutter) and a great deal of interference from other radar equipment. No
targets of the type considered as UFOs were present on the film.

3. The inclosures were received in this division in a sealed package listed
as "One sealed package".

4. Delay in forwarding inclosures is due to time required to obtain prints of
some of the film frames.
