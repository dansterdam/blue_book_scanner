This case was reported in March-April 1966. Since the actual sighting had occurred some time ago it is almost impossible to check it out. Also due to the time lag the pertinent data has probably become distorted. Therefore this case is considered Information Only.

"On the evening of July 3, 1953, noticing the clearness of a full moonlit sky I was very much impressed to take my telescope into my backyard and taking a look. My telescope opened to about 5 feet, so was very powerful. While watching a series of black discs travel over the moon's face, I suddenly detected the rim of a black surface begin to protrude at the lower left edge of the moon's rim. Very slowly but surely it grew and grew until this great disc was completely outlined by our moon, thus it, all was be lower edge, but enough was sighted and its movement was slow enough as to get an EXCELLENT description. It was immense! With a sort of glow around the outer edge just a shade lighter than the moon's color. This great black disc was moving along very slowly and smoothly from left to right of the moon so that I was able to take CAREFUL notice four exhausts in the four forms of humps on its outer edge and these exhausts were moving "clock-wise" (left to right). As the upper exhaust moved to about the center of the moon, I was able to detect a thin vapor of dark smoke trailing behind then evaporate into nothing, just as the exhaust smoke does on one of our engines when it is idling."

METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. Mariners reporting their observations of these bodies are greatly assisting in this work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of observation as accurately as possible, either by bearing and altitude, or by relation to fixed stars, or both.

Complicated observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift are of special importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

NORTH ATLANTIC

First Officer A. G. Scarpa of the Panamanian SS. Nassau, Capt. F. Perilli, Master, reports that on July 7, 1953, at 0300 G. M. T., in lat. 39°19' N, lon. 74°09' W, a brilliant meteor was observed. The meteor appeared to start from the constellation of Ursa Major at an approximate altitude of 40° and traveled horizontally. The head of this meteor was yellow-white in color and was considered as bright as Venus. Sparks trailed behind for a distance of approximately 10° arc. The phenomenon existed for about 8 seconds after which it suddenly vanished in the vicinity of Vega.

Second Officer Piero Buntier of the Italian SS. Eugenio C, Capt. 
F. Pieroni, Master, reports that on two occasions, while en route 
from Genoa to Baltimore, sun sights were affected by an abnor-
mal horizon depression. On the 18th and 20th July 1953, the 
1000 sun sight, taken by three different observers, was appar-
ently in error, and was carried over to the noon position as the 
morning sun line was almost perpendicular to the ship's course.

Mr. Buntier states that no other explanation can be made for 
the great difference between the run from the morning star posi-
tion and noon and that from the noon position and evening stars.

On both occasions the calculated speed during the morning period 
was 8 knots less than the speed during the evening period.

'Shooting Stars' Seen
By Two Men At Dillon

DILLON, S. C., Aug. 1 (JP) - He had seen two objects falling north by west from the skies about 9 p. m. Thursday, the report was made by J. C. Allen, who said his attention to the objects was called by T. B. Larsh. They fell within a few seconds of each other.

The first - more than a half dozen miles long - was discovered by John C. Allen several miles south of Latn. Osborne. It was covered by a meteor trail. They were puzzled by the residents said they had not heard the sound of a large crater.

Another crater, much smaller than the first, was discovered in the same area. It was only about 8 feet wide. The top of a nearby pine tree was only slightly burned as though struck by lightning.

David Poe Reaves, who set specimens of a swirled, pulverized substance at Claflin College, has not yet analyzed them.

Dear Sir,

I am forwarding copies of correspondence I initiated some 13 years ago in the hope that I might be of assistance to your program. I have never had the slightest expectation that the local security office would do any more than file this reference. At the time, photographs were few and far between and I believed my training as a professional engineer and NRA marksmanship instructor might be taken seriously. I have never had the courtesy of a reply for my troubles.

Due to the present reawakening of interest, I thought that the attached might lend some additional data, or because of the time interval deserve some unclassified explanation.

Very truly yours,

Gentlemen:

On the afternoon of July 15th, 1953 I had taken off the afternoon to entertain guests from Portland and was engaged in small talk about the various tax, etc. Shortly after 1 have occurred a very queer and I spotted an object in the sky which appeared to be a large kite. We turned my 50 power Estoch and 12.5 observation telescope on the object and it turned out to be a large check of brass perhaps 30,000 feet at observation. Having been impressed with the tremendous resolving power of the instrument to examine the sides with our naked eye for other objects such as birds at high altitude. Our usual for this observation was near Kennewick.

At about 14:50 hours we sighted a bright shimmering object at very extreme altitude, perhaps 30,000 feet, perhaps such however. This object hovered at a north azimuth to Richland of about 60 degrees. I tried to pick up the object in the telescope and while trying to locate it in the very small field, about 15 minutes later, my friend located another similar object a short distance away. At this time we were convinced that they were birds, but had not yet sighted one in the glass because of the small field. Suddenly small 3 specks appeared hovering and drifted off to the west and disappeared. Still not giving this much thought I continued to search for the original object. After about three minutes searching I was able to bring it under observation and hold it continuously for a period of two minutes until 14:44 hours.

At first I thought I had found a large bird, but closer examination proved to be an unusual object. The first glance gave an impression of a helicopter with the rotor stationary, but I was soon convinced I had never seen anything like this before. No telescope has wings too, nor hover with a stationary rotor. I noted to my quote on 15 July "I saw the object in the glass very carefully it seemed as though the white parts were more intense features of a transparent disc-like body. I cannot be sure as the object only covered about one-fourth of the diameter of the field, which would make it about 20 seconds of arc. It was either very small or very high. At no time did any part appear to rotate. But the helicopter idea was gone. I was too curious to let this vapor cloud which appeared to be the object slip away. The attached sketch, showing the object as it appeared from the bottom will give you [?] lost impression. Just as I had become convinced that was a real thing, I will attempt to describe the object as best I can toward the east disappearing on the eastern horizon in about 10 seconds. The latter motion could only be observed with the naked eye.

I spend about 4 hours a week looking through this glass while target shooting and am confident that I observed a factual object of very unusual characteristics.

Dear Sir:

This will acknowledge your recent letter concerning the unusual object sighted by you in the vicinity of Richland, Washington. On the day the letter was received the matter was referred to the Security Division of the Atomic Energy Commission since it appeared that such information would be of primary interest to that organization and to the Army and Air Force.

You may be assured that your report will be treated factually. In the event any of the interested services desire to contact you further, they will probably do so directly.

I appreciate your interest in referring this to our attention, and hope that anything else which comes to your attention which you think might be of interest to this office will be referred to us.

Very truly yours,
