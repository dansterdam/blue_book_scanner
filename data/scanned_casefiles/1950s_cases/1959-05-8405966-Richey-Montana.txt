Dear Mr.

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your recent report of a material found in a field near Richey, Montana, which appeared as strips of aluminum. The sample of this material which you forwarded with your report has been analyzed and determined to be chaff?

Chaff is a material which is dropped from aircraft in an effort to make radar detection difficult. In this instance the chaff was dropped by our planes during a practice mission.

Sincerely

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
