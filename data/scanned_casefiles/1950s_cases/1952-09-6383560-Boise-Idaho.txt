The object was about 1,500 feet above the aircraft, moving east to west, and appearing to be a saucer-shaped object of approximately 50 feet in diameter, traveling at an estimated speed of 420 knots. The object was described as silvery in color and reflecting sunlight. After several minutes, it disappeared from view at a very high rate of speed.
