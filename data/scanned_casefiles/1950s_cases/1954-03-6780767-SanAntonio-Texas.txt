SAUCER MARGINALIA... A Review of Significant Sightings Collected by CRIFO
March 9, 1954, 3:57 A.M.    Sighter: John H. Stewart of Cincinnati, Ohio.
                            Owns pilot's license; 6500 hours military flying time.

While driving north on Paddock Road under a dark, moonless sky, Stewart saw a bright halo of pulsating, bluish white light. It was moving slowly in a southerly course. Inside the luminescent halo appeared a dark ellipsoidal body which he described as "definitely solid", looking much like a "manufactured" mechanism.

The object hovered for over seven or eight minutes over Cincinnati's General Electric plant. Stewart had his car stopped, and for four minutes took carefully its size. He said the object was as large as a half dollar held at arm's length. Its elevation was estimated at 2 or 3 thousand feet... thus the object may have been large.

While trying to watch its movements, Stewart said the elliptical object suddenly changed color, transforming from a fairly dull appearance to a bright white color. The object suddenly changed its course, abruptly climbing almost vertically red. On course was then upward, almost vertical climb. No sound was heard. A vapor trail visible.

BLUEOIDS ... THEIR EVIDENCE AND THE EXPERTS:    Mr. J. Ackeret,
professor of aerodynamics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich,
recently visited the General Electric plant near Cincinnati, in his itinerary of
aerodynamic installations in the U.S. When asked about flying "saucers" the
professor and his believes American can quit worrying. He described them
as "illusions".

Professor Ackeret is not alone among the "experts" who have belittled the "sau-
cer" or discredited sightings. Perhaps the most myopic of skeptics
is Dr. Roy R. Marshall, director of Meteorological Planetarium. In his pedantic
address to U. of Cincinnati, Nov. 5, 1952, Dr. Marshall said that only two
groups are qualified to thoroughly observe the skies -- meteorologists and as-
tronomers, and "neither of these has ever seen a so-called 'flying saucer'."
Dr. Marshall, of course, was wrong. Several astronomers have reported un-
identified disc-shaped objects, the most significant being Dr. Clyde Tombaugh,
the discoverer of the planet Pluto. In 1949, over Los Cruces, New Mexico, he
and his family witnessed an object which he described as a "solid ship" of a
kind he had never seen before. It was oval shaped and "seemed to trail off at
the rear into a shapeless luminescence." The object emanated a blue-green
glow, and about a half dozen windows were clearly visible at the front of the
ship and along the side.

Many similar sightings have been reported, not only by astronomers, meteo-

SAUCER MARGINALIA ... A Review of Significant Sightings Collected by CRIFO

March 9, 1954, 3:57 A.M.    Sighter: John H. Stewart of Cincinnati, Ohio.
                             Owns pilot's license; 6500 hours military flying time.

While driving north on Paddock Road under a dark, moonless sky, Stewart saw a bright halo of pulsating, bluish white light. It was moving slowly in a southerly course. Inside the luminescent halo appeared a dark elliptical body which he described as "definitely solid", looking much like a "manufactured" machine.

The object hovered for seven or eight minutes over Cincinnati's General Electric plant. Stopping his car, Stewart had a good four minute look. In comparing its size, he said the object was as large as a half dollar held at arm's length. Its elevation was estimated at 2 or 3 thousand feet ... thus the object may have been larger than a DC-6.

While trying in vain to find someone to verify his sighting, Stewart said the ellipsoid picked up acceleration, "abruptly changed color, transforming from bluish white to yellow to motion red." The object suddenly changed course to the east and disappeared in seconds ... in an upward, almost vertical climb. No sound was heard, no vapor trail visible.
