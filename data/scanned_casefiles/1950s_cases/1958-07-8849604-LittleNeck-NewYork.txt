Page number: 263

Handwritten text at bottom of page: "Formation"

The page contains two tables/forms with multiple columns and rows, but the text within the tables is mostly illegible due to the low resolution and image quality. The page appears to be part of an official document, with "APPENDIX III" visible on the right side of the page.

There are some handwritten circles and arrows on the bottom table, but the specific details cannot be clearly read.

The page number 262 is visible on the right side of the top table, and 263 is visible on the right side of the bottom table.


- page 3 -

On the left side of the page, handwritten text reads:
"I DON'T KNOW
TO ME IT LOOKED LIKE 8 SHIMMY
TAKE IT"

On the bottom left of the page, handwritten text reads:
"NOT FAMILIAR
WITH FLYING
TESTS"

The rest of the page appears to be a form or document with printed text, but the specific details are not clearly legible in this image. The page is numbered "26" in the top right corner and "265" in the bottom right corner, and appears to be part of "APPENDIX III".

Here is the text from the document:

266 • APPENDIX III                                                APPENDIX III • 267

[Handwritten note at bottom right of form: "I REALLY THINK THAT THEY WERE FLYING SAUCERS"]

[Handwritten note on form: "DIDN'T JUST TELL MOTHER"]

[The document contains a form with several sections and two hand-drawn illustrations:
- One illustration shows an angular diagram with a point A and B
- Another illustration shows a landscape scene with a road and some small objects in the sky]

The rest of the text appears to be part of a form with numbered sections, but most of the printed text is too small or blurry to reliably transcribe.
