JOHN MCCURDY
CAPT. USAF
AFOIR
LITTLE NECK, NEW YORK, 8 JULY 1958
AT APPROX. 2200 HOURS

CAPT. MCCURDY SIGHTED AN AIRBORNE OBJECT WHICH EXHIBITED SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROX. 1 MINUTE, PASSED OVER LITTLE NECK, NEW YORK, AND PROCEEDED IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION.

CAPT. MCCURDY DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS ROUND IN SHAPE, APPROXIMATELY 15-20 FEET IN DIAMETER, WITH A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT ON THE UNDER SIDE. ALTHOUGH HE WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT, HE ESTIMATED IT TO BE BETWEEN 1500-2000 FEET. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED AGAINST A CLEAR NIGHT SKY AND PROCEEDED AT A RELATIVELY SLOW SPEED.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME WERE CLEAR WITH 10 MILES VISIBILITY. CAPT. MCCURDY STATED THAT HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THIS OBJECT WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

The image contains two illustrations. The first illustration appears to be a diagram or sketch depicting something that the witness describes as "they were something like this when I first saw them then broke up into them". The second illustration shows multiple images, including a landscape scene with mountains and what appears to be a flying saucer-like object in the sky.
