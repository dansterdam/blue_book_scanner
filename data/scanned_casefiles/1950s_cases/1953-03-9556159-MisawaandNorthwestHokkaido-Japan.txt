1. Description: At approximately 2025L, 1 March 1953 an unidentified airborne source of light which reportedly changed colors from yellowish green to orange to pink was sighted by two members of Rumoi AF Detachment on a bearing of approximately 270 degrees from station and 55 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to fade and reappear several times within 35 minutes during which time it progressed to a bearing of 230 degrees and 10 degrees above the horizon where it disappeared completely.

2. Time of sighting: 2025I - 2101I, 1 March 1953.

3. Manner of observation: Visual from the ground without optical aids.

4. Location of observation: Rumoi AF Detachment, Northwest Hokkaido, Japan, (43-374), 141-003.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: This appears to be another incident of a sighting of the same object which was reported on 25 and 26 February as well as on several other occasions during the past month, and which is believed to be a star. As mentioned in the flash report reference this incident a photograph of the object was attempted and apparently not with some measure of success. However, subject print will not be available for at least another week due to transportation and courier schedules. From the detachment and report is submitted without to prevent further delay. Photo will be forwarded at earliest possible date.

STATEMENTS

On 1 March 1953 I sighted a starlike object at 2025 hours. It was at approximately 270 degrees azimuth at 35 degrees elevation.

It first appeared to have a yellowish green color, but later took on a dull pink color.

After first appearing, the object faded out intermittently for periods of 10 to 20 seconds and then remained visible at its brightest for about 10 minutes. It then faded out for several minutes and reappeared for 5 minutes, and then reappeared for several more minutes. It faded for the last time at 2101 hours. By this time it had progressed to an azimuth of about 230 degrees and the elevation had dropped to about 10 degrees.

While visible the object appeared to move toward and away from one position and also gave the impression of booming or vibrating. No radar that I observed at the time gave any appearance or effect like this and though some clouds were present, they did not appear to be the cause of the objects fading at any time.

I cannot estimate the range of the object, therefore I cannot determine the altitude or the speed of its apparent motion.

On 1 March 1953, at 2025 hours, I was on duty in radar operations. I was notified at this time that the manual objects that was seen several nights previously had been sighted again. I was the radar operator on duty at this time, therefore my observation of this unknown object was limited to about two minutes. The object looked similar to a star except it was much brighter. It seemed to be bobbing up and down. The object was at 270 degrees from this station and was at about a 30 degree angle from the horizon.

At 2035 hours I called one of our FM Relays and asked them to observe this object. At 2048 hours they called back and stated they could not see it. They had observed it to may have been able to get a crude fix, and therefore have asked to get additional information to altitude and range.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

TO: 516th ACSW Group                                   IR 9-53                   PAGE    01    OF    02    PAGES

D/F: JCPG COMMENT:
(Reference also IR 8-43, 516th ACSW Group)

This sighting of 1 March 1953 appears to coincide with similar earlier sightings on 25 and 26 February 1953 in which the object sighted appeared to be a star-like or first magnitude information to warrant a possible alternate explanation.

Attached are three (3) contact negatives and prints made at the time of this sighting. Camera Information: Bolsey B-2, lens opening f/3.2, time exposure.

Information from photographer is noted below:

Picture #1 photographed between 2025-2035T on 1 March 1953. Camera pointed west. The streak in center is light.

Picture #2 photographed between 2040-2145T on 1 March 1953. Camera pointed west. The streak again in center is light. Streak is upper left, believed to be bright star or planet.

Picture #3 was taken on 6 March 1953 and submitted in report of this IR 9-53 as it appears to be a similar type of sighting. Photographed between 2330-2105T. Camera pointed west. Bright streak in center is the sighted object which appears again below a bright point of first. Other streaks are stars.

Breaks in streaks, quote #3 in particular, were made by star and object movement during time exposure and was caused by cloud movement and by fading due to unknown causes. Other streaks and marks are scratches and blemishes on negative.
