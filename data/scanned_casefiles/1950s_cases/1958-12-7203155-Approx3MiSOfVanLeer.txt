k. Preparing Officer's Position Title - Air Division Operations & Training
Preparing Officer, Comments - On 30 December 1953 the Air Provost Marshal received
a telephone call from a air matter. Tennessee reporting the possession of the above mentioned
matter. Two (2) Air Policemen were dispatched to the above cited residence
to receive the material. Upon the delivery of the material to the base,
the preparing officer was contacted at which time a telephone conversation
was established with Mr. Tennessee stated that subject
material had been recovered on the farm of his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Taulbee, Hickory County, Tennessee approximately the middle of December 1953 and had been sighted by them
during the early evening hours. It was observed, as first, to be high in
the sky descending rapidly and burning intensely. As it descended its rate
of fall decreased until near the earth it appeared as a flaking object.
This could account for the decreasing density of the substance which
apparently was rather heavy upon initial observation. Recovered material
is very light and porous.

1. Subject material is in security at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee awaiting disposition instructions.

           ATTN: Maj. R. Fried

I.   PURPOSE:
     Determine nature of material for use in analyzing U.F.O. Case.

II.  FACTUAL DATA:

1.   A dark brown amorphous material was submitted and assigned Materials
     Physics Branch Serial No. 5117.

2.   The solubility of the material was examined. It was found to be
     insoluble in the usual organic solvents (chloroform, other,
     benzene, etc.). The material was soluble in water and methanol
     and formed a syrup.

3.   Infrared spectra of the methanol extract and of a pyrolozate of the
     sample were obtained. The spectra were compared with a spectrum
     of a pyrolozate of sucrose and found to be similar. The submitted
     sample appears, therefore, to be a sugar.

4.   To confirm this, a small quantity of the sample was dissolved in
     ethanol and some 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent added. A
     crystalline precipitate formed on standing.

5.   A water solution of the submitted sample was found to readily
     reduce Fehling's solution. If the sample was pure sucrose, it
     would not reduce Fehling's solution, but in the partially oxidized
     state of the sample, some hydrolysis products would be present.

6.   An emission spectra of the submitted sample shows between 0.1 to
     1% silicon plus a trace of magnesium, aluminum, iron and calcium.

III. CONCLUSIONS:

The submitted sample MP 5117 appears to be a partially oxidized or burned sugar. The results of the tests run on it indicate it is probably a mixture of mono and disaccharides.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS:

None, data merely submitted.
