The text from the document is as follows:

In his report, he described the objects as round with orange lights, in unison. In his report, he described the objects as round with orange lights.
11. COMMENTS: Case handled badly. Public relations (PIO) office did not obtain intelligent evaluation because of unintelligent person being used and the haste to close the case before any analysis was made. L.A. Office of Info says that the filming was probably the best UFO report they have received but concludes negatively. At the same time study analysis indicate best observations by military of latest types of Soviet equipment. Data considered insufficient for evaluation. Unknown.
