Dear Sir:

While visiting the air park here in Marshall, Texas, I landed the sound of an object over here which could be looked up to some height. I could see it. Another of same or white object which appeared to be very high traveling in a northwesterly direction. This was that it maneuvered in was wiggles and curves of flight path, although in visible time. So far that of my knowledge in minutes. It appeared to be one and one-half to three gagging in its fading and I do not know just what this object was and this is the best I can give you this information.
