Here is the text from the document:

(5) Its angle of entry was very steep, from an angle of 80 degrees to 85 degrees perpendicular to the surface of the earth. It came right on in, it didn't have to use the roller coaster type of entry that the apollo-type had to use.

This by the way is one reason that I didn't try to report this to the Air Force at that time because in those days you know better than I that we hadn't been getting into space and that any object striking our atmosphere at those kinds of speeds would be burned up, and the Air Force was telling everyone slowly lying a line they were for seeing less spectacular things.

When we got into San Jose I phoned the news paper office - San Jose Mercury - to see if anyone else had reported it.

When it left us it appeared to go over wing near to Moffett field. At Travel

Air Station. I asked the newspaper office if they would phone them to see if they picked any thing up on their radar. A few minutes later the paper phoned me back and said that Moffitt Field would not tell them anything. The newspaper office also tell me that they had been getting a lot of calls lately of UFO sightings but none other this particular night.

Mr. London I realize that without any scientific proof this report is probably without value in terms of changing any policy, but I just had to write it from my mind. I have never had anything bug me so much.

I know it sounds crazy but I really felt that it was my duty as a member of this human race to report it to some one like you. One thought that has really bothered me then even before it.

I read your report, in the great distance
to the nearest solar system to our own
I know it in terms of light years
and I understand that other intelligent
life within our own solar system has
pretty well been ruled out. I think
from this that you can get a pretty
good picture as to what has been going
through my mind.

Dr. Condon I would certainly like
to thank you for your valuable time
in reading this letter, if you could
spare a few minutes to drop me a line
to acknowledge that you received this
letter I would really appreciate it. Plus
are a few details I didn't put in this letter
and if I can be of any assistance please feel
free to call on me.

I am employed by the Butte County Dept
of Public Works. My title is assistant Civil
Engineer. My regular duties are

P.S.
I will mention my brother name

connect with him about writing it.
I won't write this for any publicity.
One of thing that I have told you is

willing to submit to any kind of lie

Dear Sir:                                                        Postmarked 17 Nov 69

I am forwarding a letter to your office regarding a U.F.O. Sighting that I had sent to Dr. Edward M. Condon at the University of Colorado. They returned my letter the other day with a note stating that the project office there was closed and no further work is being done on the study, and they suggested that I send it to you.

I hope that you will excuse me for not sending this letter to you first but I didn't know who to send it to, and I became a little concerned quite reading the conclusion of Dr. Condon's report in the page.

Sincerely,
[signature area is blacked out]

RECEIVED FEB 24 1969

Dear Mr. Condon

I have read the report recently that you and your group of scientists released to the press regarding UFO's.

The conclusion of your report plus a few other factors have prompted me to write this letter.

I would like to report a sighting that my brother + I made in 1955, with the last part of Nov or the first part of Dec. The biggest reason that I am reporting it now is because I have never read or heard of another sighting quite like it. This thought has been haunting me for quite awhile, and so I would like you to be the judge of whether it was a significant sighting or not.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(2)
At the time of the sighting I was
living in San Jose Calif. with my
oldest brother. We were returning
to San Jose from a pleasant hunting
trip in Gridley. We were on the
highway leads south between McPheta
and San Jose, it was approx. 11:15 P.M.
and the weather was as clear as a bell.
I was riding on the passenger side,
looking out the window when out of
the corner of my eye I saw a flash.
As I looked up I saw what appeared
to be a meteor just striking our
atmosphere and falling toward us at a
tremendous rate of speed. It kept coming
and wouldn't burn out. It scared me and
startled me so much that I yelled out to
my brother to look, and as I yelled I took
my eyes off it for a couple of seconds
but my brother had seen it by this time
too - and he said hell that no meteor.

Here is the text from the document:

(3) When I looked back at it, it was coming to a stop at an elevation of approx. 1500 to 2,000 ft. and I would estimate it to be approx. 1/4 of a mile from us horizontally. It was approx. 50 ft. to 75 ft. in diameter. It looked just like a large ball of "white hot" fire. At first it was kind of hard to tell what shape it was exactly, because of the tremendous brilliance and glow, but as it began to cool you could see that it was nearly round. I was not quite slightly displeased. We were not sure struck that we had not idea what we were witnessing.

The object stayed there hovering for about five minutes and there was no sound at all, and then I noticed that the color was beginning to change slightly from the white hot color to more of a yellow, and then it left us in a temple. Almost of speed.


- page 12 -

Here is the text from the document:

which I would estimate as approx.
1500 miles per hour. I had spent
nearly four years in the Air Force and
had watched F-86's + F-94's make
their fastest runs, but I had never
seen anything move as fast as this
thing. When it pulled out it left in a huge
arc but at the same elevation. As it
got further away its color changed to
a bright orange, but just before it
went out of sight over the horizon
toward the coast it turned very bright
again and a little larger. We thought it
was coming back to where we were, and
it seemed to point off of me, but it
kept steadily toward the coast and went
out of sight. We sort of thought that
its own friction had caused it to get
bright again. When it first came into
the atmosphere its entry speed must have
been many thousands of miles per hour.
