1. The following item appeared in the Singapore Straits Times on 6 September 1952 what they believed to be a flying saucer:

"Several citizens rushed out of their homes, offices and shops to look at a strange object in the sky traveling from west to east. They exclaimed loudly before looking shocked."

"Several phone calls were made to the Straits Times office here reporting that a strange streak of smoke was seen in the sky."

"Mr. R. Dingnath, a businessman, said he saw a streak of smoke in an otherwise clear sky. It appeared to resemble a fiery, trailing object which seemed to vanish."

"There was no plane, no drone or sound of any kind at the time he saw it."

"It lasted about fifteen seconds and seemed to plunge downward at a high speed."

"It is the second time in the last few days that a strange object has been seen."
