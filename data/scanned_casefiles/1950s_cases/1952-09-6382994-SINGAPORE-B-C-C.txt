SUMMARY: (brief outline or summary of report)

1. The following item appeared in the Singapore Straits Times on 5 September 1952:

"There was excitement in two towns in the Federation today when people saw what they believed to be a flying saucer.

"Several hundreds of Seremban citizens rushed out of their homes, offices and shops to look at a strange object in the sky traveling from west to east. They described the object as a 'flying saucer'. This was shortly before noon.

"Several phone calls were made to the Straits Times office here reporting the phenomenon and asking what it was.

"Mr. R. Singam, a businessman said he saw a streak of smoke in an otherwise clear sky. It stayed in the sky for about 10 minutes before going eastwards.

"There was no plane, no drones or sound of any kind at the time he added.

"In Batu Pahat, reports out correspondent there, crowds gazed skywards at a white 'plate' apparently westwards at great speed.

"It is the second time in the last few days that a strange object has been seen."
