The handwritten text on the form states the following:

The object observed was rather strange in appearance and maneuver. It appeared quite large as seen in the sky and the way it moved was most unusual. I did observe it for a considerable period of time but never was able to get a clear, detailed view as it seemed to be rather high up. It would seem to hover and then dart off in a different direction at a rapid rate of speed. Then it would stop and hover again. The color seemed to be a bright reddish orange when it was visible. The sky was quite clear and there was plenty of daylight at the time. I do not know what it was, but it was most unusual and certainly not any type of known aircraft.

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line with markings on it, accompanied by instructions to imagine the viewer is at the point "A" on the curved line and that the object was above the horizon (skyline) when first seen. The smaller sketch on the right shows a road or path leading away with hills or mountains in the distance.

In the larger sketch, the instructions state to place a point "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The text instructs the viewer to refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

OCR output:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown: Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
