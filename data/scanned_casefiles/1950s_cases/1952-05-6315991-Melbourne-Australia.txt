REPORT OF UNUSUAL SIGHTINGS ON 5TH MAY, 1952.

1.   It is desired to advice that on 4th May, 1952, Wing Commander T. L. CAMPBELL
requested that the Staff Officer Intelligence and the Assistant Provost Marshal
jointly investigate newspaper reports of unusual sightings on 5th May, 1952.

2.   [Mostly redacted]

3.   [Redacted] employee, of [redacted], was interviewed and he said "At about 6:10 A.M. on 3rd May, I was sitting in a P.M.G.
truck outside the Enfield Post Office with [redacted] (driver) and William
[redacted]. We were watching the sky and Drew my attention to a strange light
across the sky. We all watched it for a few seconds. From the truck, then we all
got out of the truck and stood in the street. Once while we were watching it,
it disappeared behind clouds but I saw it again and pointed it out to the others.
Finally it disappeared behind a cloud and we did not see it again.

4.   When asked to describe the object, he said "It looked like a number (no
definite) of street lights in a circular light. The colour of the
lights was similar to street lighting, there was no noise, no apparent shape. The
height seemed to be similar to the height of aircraft I have seen flying around
SYDNEY but the speed was definitely faster although I don't think it was twice as
fast. The truck was facing south and the lights seemed to pass in front of the truck,
moving eastward. The lights followed a straight path and did not seem to be concerned
and I did not see any trail or vapour behind the lights."

[Paragraph 6 is partially obscured, but appears to describe an individual employed by East-West Airlines who was in a taxi and saw three large lights with a string of smaller lights behind them in the southwest. The lights appeared to move rapidly and then dim, and the witness thought it might be a jet aircraft.]

7. Captain [name redacted], an ex-R.A.A.F. pilot and now a pilot employed by T.A.A. said "At about 0800 hours on 3rd May I was driving my car along the Rose Highway approximately 3 miles from Strathfield towards Parramatta. I sighted an intense white light, round like a ball, at an elevation of 500 above the horizon. The light moved across the sky from south-west to east and as it moved across it appeared to look like a feather-shaped object. I slowed the car to break away from the main road. This gave a blunt round clear shape to the light. I watched the object for about 60 seconds and it seemed to vanish in a straight line to the east until it disappeared. I stopped the car and discussed the matter with [name redacted] who was also of T.A.A., who was following me in another car."

8. Mr. [name redacted], a nerve specialist, No. 250 Victoria Avenue, Chatwood, said "At approximately 0810 hours on 3rd May I was driving my car on Strathfield House-wards from Strathfield to Enfield on my way to the Mascot aerodrome. I am an instructor at the Flying School. At a distance of approximately 1 mile, I observed a bright, clear-shaped object with a cluster of lights at the forward end and a similar cluster at the rear end. I saw a grey mass converging the two clusters of lights and I estimate the height to be approximately 5,000 feet and the speed 500-600 miles per hour. The object moved from west to east, seemed to descend slightly and disappeared from my view behind a cloud. On my arrival at Mascot Club, of my sightings, [name redacted] told me what I had seen was a Consolidated Aircraft sighting. I learned later that I had heard of sightings at 0810 as I had just previously heard 0800 given over the radio."

9. Mr. [name redacted], an employee of the Bank of New South Wales, Hunter Street, and interviewed, Dr. [name redacted] an ex-R.A.A.F. officer and at present Flying Officer in the R.A.A.F., was driving in a southwesterly direction when I saw a bright light, like a particularly bright star, directly ahead at an elevation of 350. The light was a blue-white colour. The light appeared to be a stationary and then seemed to emit a trail or tail of light or sparks and then moved rapidly to the southwest massive. From a cloud I watched the object a second time but I did not see any particular shape nor could I estimate the speed."

Air Attache, Australia                IR-203-53                UNCLASSIFIED

10. Mr. [redacted] Aircraft Accident Inspector employed by Qantas Empire Airways, said "At about 0610 hours on 3rd May I was driving to aerodrome and my attention was drawn to an aircraft in the south-west, by connection to the early this morning." I glanced up and saw what appeared to be the sun shining on the polished surface of an aircraft fuselage. I said "Is that a Constellation course; it is probably a D.C.4." The object appeared to be flying on a straight course in the direction of [redacted]. It was noted 6000-8000 feet above the ground traveling at a normal aircraft speed. I did not follow its flight and merely dismissed it as a normal aircraft approaching Mascot. Subsequently I was informed that no aircraft arrived at Mascot at that time."

11. Mr. [redacted] Qantas Airways Operations Officer, said "At about 0910 hours on 3rd Day I observed what I thought was a Constellation aircraft to the north-west. I saw what appeared to be a very shiny, or bright, or unusual surface of an aircraft and thought I saw a fin shaped similar to the fin of a Constellation, I said to Mr. [redacted] "There is a Constellation coming in." It is a bit off track for the Constellation. I may be a D.C.4". I was subsequently told that the Constellation I expected to see did not arrive at [redacted]."

12. Mr. [redacted] (between [redacted] and [redacted]) said "At about ten past six on the morning of 3rd May I was walking from my home in [redacted] towards [redacted] in a cluster of lights at an elevation of about 30° to 40° in the south-west, travelling easy. The colour of the light was yellow, similar to a trent lights. The cluster appeared to emit a display and seemed to be about half the speed of a falling star. The lights appeared to cross the coastline due south of my position and disappeared behind a cloud to me. I could not see any shape or size."

13. Mr. [redacted] said "I was riding a motor cycle northbound along the [redacted] just on the side of [redacted], when I observed a bluish-white light between the trees. It appeared to be oval shaped, tapering to a point at the rear and seemed to be travelling north-west. I stopped the motor cycle and with my companion [redacted], watched the light disappear behind some trees. I estimated the time to be a little after 0610. My car was parked and the park light was turned off my headlamp and was driving with the park light on. The light appeared to travel in a straight line and left a trail of sparks approximately the same length as the trail left by the light of the small local brilliant."

14. Miss [redacted] said "I was travelling on a motor cycle with [redacted] on the morning of 3rd May. Just before 0611 hours, between the trees, a blue-white light, oval in shape, with a trail of light with a lesser trilliance behind it. I watched it for a short time until I lost sight of it behind some trees. It appeared to be travelling in a straight line towards the northeast."

15. Mr. [redacted] was interviewed on this matter. "Approximately 0500-0610 hours on 3rd May near HEATHCOTE, was travelling by car on the [redacted] near HEATHCOTE from the south-west to the east at an elevation of about 30°. The object was brilliantly lighted. The front portion was an intense white with a blue tint and a string of following."

Air Atrocha, Australia                                    TR-203-53

                                                            UNCLASSIFIED

22. Where an impression of distance has been formed in most cases the observer
was of the opinion that the lights or objects were within a ten mile radius, and
where an estimate of elevation has been made the consensus of opinion is between
300 to 400°. Although various impressions of colour and size are given, it is considered that the variations in reports were in most cases due to the short
length of time the light was seen.

23. The investigating officers formed the following opinion:
    a. The sighting was of a light, not of an object.
    b. The light was of a considerable distance (not less than sixty (60) miles)
       from the earth's surface.
    c. The light was probably caused by a meteor or similar body.

In regard to the above opinions although several reports stated than an object
had been seen, it is considered that the observers in these cases may have been
influenced by a previous reading of reports in newspapers and magazines. The distance
factor is borne out in that all observers were facing the northeast sky and while all
had the same general that the light was merely a few miles away, the most southerly sighting
had the most northerly sighting. It will also be noted that the observer in para. 12 gave the
elevation as between 300 and 40°. This observer was some thirty (30) miles south of
the location of the most northerly sighting. The investigator is of the opinion that the
elevation although the observer is thirty (30) miles closer to the light. Furthermore, no parallax of significance was noted which would indicate a considerable
distance from the earth's surface.

24. In support of the meteor theory many observers gave their impression as a
large light or lights. Followed by similar lights. The investigating officers are
of the opinion that this impression could be given by the break up of a large meteor.

25. Recommendations.
    It is recommended that any future investigations as a result of newspaper
reports be conducted as follows:
    a. Copies of all leading State and Interstate daily newspapers be obtained
       covering the period of the reports.
    b. The Commonwealth Meteorologist be contacted for an opinion as to reports
       and sightings made by official observers.
    c. Individual interviews then be undertaken if deemed necessary.

26. Attached are copies of various reports which appeared in SYDNEY newspapers.
