Memorandum for Record                                                                27 August 1952

Subject: Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Object Reported by

1. On 21 Aug 52 Capt E. J. Ruppelt and 2/Lt R. D. Olsson of Blue Book and Capt Hoey and Capt Douglas Davis departed Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at approximately 1500 EST in a B-25 aircraft for West Palm Beach Municipal Airport, Florida. At approximately 1930 EST they arrived at West Palm Beach, Florida. Capt Hoey and Capt Davis originally planned to return to Patterson AFB, but due to mechanical trouble with the B-25 they stayed and participated in the investigation.

2. Upon landing the ATIC group spoke to the Intelligence Officer. He was aware of the purpose of the trip. He mentioned that people has seen flares in the vicinity of the sighting areas at some unknown time and said that it was generally believed that the scoutmaster had been hit by a flare. At the time of the talk with the Capt Zahn he obtained no data as to what he was referring. However, later Capt Zahn's story became more significant but he could not be located. (More details have been requested from him).

3. On the morning of 22 Aug 52 Capt Carney, Wing Intelligence Officer of the 1707th Air Base Wing, West Palm Beach Municipal Airport, Florida, was contacted. He showed the ATIC party copies of statements he had received from the scoutmaster, three boyscouts, and other possible witnesses to the incident. These statements are being forwarded through channels Air Force Letter 200-5. The contents of these statements are the same as details obtained in interview. Details of these interviews will be given in this memo, consequently the contents of the signed statements will not be discussed.

4. Capt [REDACTED] a medical officer at the air base who had examined Mr. [REDACTED] on the evening of 21 Aug 52 was contacted. His complete report will be forwarded with the Form 112 through channels. He stated that Mr. [REDACTED] was normal physically. The hair on the back of his forearms was singed, but not badly. The skin on his forearms showed no signs of blisters, burns, or redness. He stated that if the skin had been burned it was very minor as there was absolutely no after-effects (Comment: this examination took place 45 hours after the incident). Mr. [REDACTED] stated that the hair in his nostrils had also been singed but that he had cut it out. There was no apparent evidence of this, however, the medical officer stated that he was sure of his story.

5. He stated that he had received an "Other Than Honorable" discharge from the Marines in 1944. He had been hitch-hiking and was picked up by an unknown person. The person got tired of driving and asked [REDACTED] to drive, which he did. They were picked up by law enforcement officers and it turned out that the car was stolen. He was arrested and charged with auto theft, in Civil Court, but the charges were later dropped. He said that because of this incident he was discharged from the Marines. (His Marine records have been requested).

Here is the OCR text from the document:

b. He stated that in 1948 he had had an accident in which an auto-
mobile slipped of hoist and fell on his stomach. He was hospitalized 28 months
for Diathermy treatments. The medical officer thought this was highly unlikely
due to the fact that Diathermy treatments do not require hospitalization.

c. When asked if he had ever had nightmares, he stated a flat "no",
but said that once he did have a dream about a beautiful woman and was still
looking for her. (Comment: The only reason this is mentioned in the report
is that it is possible the medical officer was somewhat psychological enjoy.
The medical officer was convinced that the psychological aspects of the case
should be pursued (Comment: It was evident that there had been a personality
clash between the medical officer and Mr. [redacted] For some reason the medical
an apparent "dim view" of [redacted].

5. About noon on 22 Aug 52 Capts Ruppelt, Hoey, Davis and Lt Classen of
ATIC, Capt. Carney and an airman from the 1707th Air Base Wing Intelligence,
the medical officer, two sheriffs from the Palm Beach County, and an airman
staff-car driver visited the scene of the incident. (See attached map and
sketch).

6. The deputies gave their account of the incident. At about 2200 EST
on the night of 19 Aug 52, they were called and told that the boyscouts were
at a house asking for help. They proceeded in separate cars to the house
(see map), picked up the scout and returned to the car on the road. (Returned
to [redacted] car) at approximately 2230 EST they saw a [redacted] coming through
the palmettos with no light, having his aches. They were a little dubious of
the whole situation and refused to come and help. [Redacted] was a registering.
He finally came out and explained the incident to the officers. They made one
definite conclusion, in all their experience as peace officers they had never
seen a person as [redacted] as [redacted].

7. They took him back into the woods and at the approximate spot he
described, they found his flashlight, a large light similar to the ones used
by railroad men, face down still burning. They also found what they believe
to be a place where a person had been lying near the light. The spot was
marked with three trenches. They then took him to the sheriff's office
in West Palm Beach. When they arrived he retold his story and they examined
his burns. They said his arm was reddened and that the hair on his arms was
singed. They did not notice, nor was it mentioned by [redacted], that the
hair in his nostrils was singed.

8. The area, 50 yards around the spot where the flashlight was found,
was searched. There was no above normal radiation, no burned foliage or grass,
no broken or trampled foliage or trees, (other than that damaged by the sheriff
and the search party) no sign of debris such as flares, nothing unusual of
any description was found. The grass and foliage in the area of the spot over
which the object hovered was compared to the grass and foliage 50 yards away.
There was no difference in the appearance.

9. One boyscout, a [redacted] aged 12 was contacted. In the presence
of his mother he stated that he had been riding with DeWjerens and two other
boyscouts. As they were passing the spot where [redacted] saw a light. They
woods, [redacted] saw a light. They did not see it. Seconds later they all

any another light. One scout wanted to go on, but [redacted] turned around and
went back to the spot and stopped. He instructed the scouts to wait 10 minutes
and if he was not back to call for help. Huffing stated that the boys observed
going through the palmetto because they could see his light. Then
he said they could see a red light go toward him, saw him silhouetted in the red
light and saw him fall. Then they ran up the road to a house that had a light
to get help. They called the Highway patrol from the house.

10. Approximately 1800 on 22 aug 52 Capt Carney sent a staff car to pick
up [redacted] in West Palm Beach and bring him out to the air base for an inter-
view. He arrived at about 1830 having not taken this to eat and was not by
Capts Ruppelt, Hoey, Davis, Carney, Lt Olsson, and a staff sergeant from Capt
Carney's office. He was very cooperative, appeared to be normal,
but just a shade on the [redacted] side (Comment: Possibly from being nervous?).
The following account is taken from notes that were taken by Capt Ruppelt during
the interview and are as near true statements as possible.

11. "I was going south (along Military Trail) about 40 IPH fooling around
with the kids (boyscouts) when I caught a flash of light out of the corner of
my eye. I looked around and saw a series of fuzzy lights like the cabin windows of an airliner. They were headed down at about a 45° angle into the woods,
then the kids saw it. I stopped and talked it over with kids then went one
block away. I stopped again because I thought that if it were an aircraft that had crashed,
I had better try to help. I turned around and went back. There was a radio
Program that had just come on, it was 9:45. I told the kids to estimate then
the program was 2/3 over (10 minutes) and if I hadn't come out to help this to
go for help as I would probably need it. I judged the lights were about to
miles from the road. I picked my way through the palmetto, looking at the
starts to keep on a 900 track from the road and climbing my light over the tops
of the palmettos to find the easy path. I looked at my watch and noticed four
minutes (time now 2149). Then I noticed an open spot ahead of me and stopped,
thinking it might be a lake. It turned out to be a clearing. I saw no lights
on the way in".

12. "As I said I was surprised at reaching a clearing, thinking it might
be a lake, and I carefully stepped forward with the light pointing toward the
ground. I had a second two cell flashlight in my backpocket".

13. "When I first stepped into the clearing I noticed a peculiar smell.
I went two or three spaces when I had the feeling somebody or something was
watching me. I kept on going and began to feel hazy, like walking close to an
oven. It was hot and humid like and it seemed to be coming from above. I
hadn't thought of looking up, then I did I couldn't see the sky. (Comment:
On being questioned on this part he meant that he couldn't see stars.) I
knew I had run into something rough. I stood frozen in my tracks. I wanted
to throw something or hit it with my matches. I felt for my flashlight in my
backpocket and thought of throwing it, but was too scared. (Comment: This
establishes that he didn't loose his flashlight going into the clearing.) The
bottom of the object was dull black with no seams, joints or rivet lines. It
had a dirty streaks running straight across as if of an old bloom hole.
(Comment: When asked if they were circular or concentric rings he said "no".)
I tried to run but froze, I was so scared. The object was about 6' to 8" above
the pine trees. I then got control of myself and backed away. I could feel the

heat lessen as I backed out from under the edge of the ship. I looked up
and saw the edge of the ship silhouetted against the sky. It was round,
with a dome shape top and with holes and fins running around the edge.
The bottom edge seemed to glow with a sort of a phosphorescent glow, like
phosphorus in the sea at night (see sketch). They seemed to be as scared of
me as I was of them. (Comment: He repeated this frequently during the
interview. When asked how he knew or what he meant, he said the object appeared
to move back as he approached.)

14. "I had my light on the object and couldn't get my eyes off it,
but as soon as I backed off I could see the object silhouetted against the
sky. I could see the dome. Then I heard metal against metal, like a hatch
opening and thought someone was going to watch me (Comment: ??-This could be
an error in note taking). I said a million prayers. I saw something nonmetal, but couldn't see what it was. Next I saw a red flare which appeared
slowly to move toward me. It came out of the side. I couldn't move or yell.
I was so scared. I could see the ship in the glow of the red light (Comment:
He kept referring to the object as a "ship" all the time). I put my hands
over my face (Comment: Fists closed, hand over each eye, palms toward face
and elbows in stomach). I could see a red mist around me, then I passed out."

15. "When I woke up I was standing next to a tree, I think. I seem to
remember stumbling through palmettos. I couldn't see and my eyes burned.
I slowly began to come back. I saw lights through the trees and started running
toward them, I didn't even know whether or not my feet were hitting the ground.
I thought I might be dead. Next I got the deputies and we went back to get my
light. The two cold flashlight is still missing."

16. Next he mentioned a dream that he had the night before.
He said that he was unable to sleep making or his experience and
had attempted to get a sedative from the druggist. The druggist would not sell
him a sedative, however, and he finally got to sleep by taking several aspirins.
He stated that he had a dream in which he had jumped across the ditch into the
clearing and was fighting with the "ship" in the air. He thinks from the dream
he might be able to go back and find where he lost the flashlight, as the whole
evenings performance seemed to have come back to him in his dreams.

17. Upon being reinterrogated as to times, he stated that he went into the
woods nearly exactly 9:45 P.M. He said for the boys to leave for help after 10
minutes. He thinks it was 8 minutes from the time he left the car until this
red light hit him in the face. He was 4 minutes getting to the edge of the
palmetto clearing.

18. Upon being reinterrogated about the odor that he smelled, he stated
that it was an "acute, sharp smell". He had never smelled anything like it
before. He works with marine acid and knows how that smells. To him a
sickening nauseating smell. He thinks that the odor is what made him pass
out. He had a woozy feeling while he was passing out, similar to being put
under anesthetic.

19. Upon being reinterrogated he went back over the following points:

a. "It was hotter than standing next to an oven, more like walking

- 4 -

into an oven". The heat was concentrated down. The further he went under the "ship" the hotter it got. He stated he perspired and felt cool when he came out from under the object.

b. "A red mist engulfed him. He was not conscious of any change in temperature when the red mist hit him. Even if it burned he still could not have felt any burn he was so scared. His eyes were glued on the object. He put his hands up before it hit him."

c. When he came to he was in the palmetto before he finally realized where he was.

d. He felt no downwash of any kind. He did hear a bubbling sound. It was possibly the boyscouts in the car, however, he was not sure of this.

e. He heard a hissing sound after he entered the clearing and noticed the object. He heard the hissing all the time he was conscious.

f. He was asked the smell of his hat to see if the odor might still be clinging to the fabric, however, it was not.

20. A discrete attempt was made to try to get him involved in a discussion of "flying saucers." He stated that he had seen a movie, "When the Worlds Collide", but that was all. He did not read "flying saucer" stories in the newspaper although he had noticed the headlines of a couple of them.

21. Mr. [redacted] stated that several people had contacted his regarding his story. They were: a) A scientist came to him from the scientist, care to his store to see him. The scientist was from Schenectady, New York. He did not know his name and brushed him off. b) A person from the University of Alabama wrote him to make a recording. He told the person that he was not interested. c) Two people from the University of Florida contacted him. They said it was evident that he knew more than he was saying, but that he would not talk to them. d) A reporter from Time Magazine, who wouldn't talk to, contacted him on the 21st. e) Some Miami radio station offered him cash for his story. f) A newspaper woman that he had known all through high school days called him but he wouldn't talk. (Comment: The above accounts are critically checked by ATIC). He appeared to like to tell how important he was.

22. [redacted] stated that he had two comments to make. They were:

a. What made it suspend? He (probably meaning the United States) can't deny gravity. He doubted that it was manufactured "here". (Comment: He probably means the United States).

b. He thought that since we are reaching out into space, someone else may be and are possibly ahead of us. He said he believed that the object was probably from outer space.

23. Mr. [redacted] then asked what he should do about people coming to talk to him. He stated that he would be very glad to cooperate with the Air Force and not talk to anyone if he was not supposed to. He was advised

- 5 -


- page 14 -

by Capt Ruppelt that it was the policy of this project not to ask any civilian to withhold any information, and the fact that we were trying to "shut him up" was not true. He then stated that he would go to local newspapers and give them the story to "get them off his neck." He was advised that he was free to do so. He seemed to be rather proud of the fact that he was brushed off so many newspaper people and others who are interested. He seemed to take great pride in throwing around such facts as people are offering money, professors had called, Time magazine had called, radio station had called, etc.

Photograph No. 1 - This is a photo looking almost straight east from the position of [redacted] automobile on the road toward the place where [redacted] claimed he got burned which is in the center of the photo past the palmetto thicket. This shot was taken through a car window to simulate that the boyScouts might have seen. In addition, you can see the edge of the palmetto thicket. While this shot was being taken, someone was standing in back of the thicket with this hand in the air. The hand is not visible in the picture, however, it was visible to the photographer. It is interesting to note, however, that only the up-stretched palm of the hand was visible, not the person's head.

Photograph No. 2 - This is a photo of the first clearing and palmetto thicket that went through on his way to the scene of the sighting. The direction is almost straight east. As far as could be determined, the center of the lower Foreground and his path went directly up the center of the photograph into the palmetto thicket.

Photograph No. 3 - This shows the palmetto thicket at the approximate point that entered. It gives an idea as to the height and density of the palmetto growth. Local citizens stated that it was "crawling" with rattlesnakes.

Memorandum for Record                                                  12 September 1952

SUBJECT:  Report of a Trip to West Palm Beach, Florida, to Investigate Sighting
          of Unidentified Aerial Objects by a Mr. [redacted]

1.  On 8 September 1952, Capt E. J. Ruppelt and Lt R. M. Olsson of ATIC-5
    traveled to West Palm Beach, Fla., to conduct a further interrogation and investigation of Mr. [redacted] that had arrived at West Palm Beach approximately 1900 EST on the 8th and contacted Capt Carney, Wing Intelligence
    Officer, 1707th Air Base Wing, on the morning of the 9th of September 1952.

2.  A conference was held with Capt Carney to determine whether or not
    there had been any late developments in this case that the two ATIC officers
    were not familiar with. Capt Carney stated that to his knowledge there was
    nothing outstanding that had happened. He was asked about the facts of supposedly
    anonymous threatening telephone calls that Mr. [redacted] had received. He
    stated that he had been receiving approximately two weeks ago (1 Sept, 52)
    and stated that he had been receiving anonymous threatening telephone calls
    while at work in the establishment in which he is employed. The calls were
    telling him to "get out" of his story and that if he didn't he would be
    sorry, etc. He was advised that threatening phone calls were not an Air Force
    function and he should go to the F.B.I. He did this but was referred to the
    local police. Capt Carney also stated that a Mr. [redacted] had nearly reached
    become interested in the case, had gone out and looked at the spot where the
    object was supposed to have hovered. Mr. [redacted] stated that he believed the grass
    had been burned and that he was going to take samples and send them to St. Louis,
    Mo., for analysis. (Comment: He did not state where in St. Louis he was planning to send the samples.) He was contacted by telephone and stated that
    due to the fact that he had reduced pressure he was unable to pick up the samples he had
    not done so and consequently there would be no report from the laboratory in St.
    Louis.

3.  Capt Carney also stated that he had talked to a Mr. [redacted] press agent, who has
    had talked to him in the presence of the base legal officer from the West Palm
    Beach International Airport. Mr. [redacted] was interested in knowing whether or not the
    air force would make a background investigation of Mr. [redacted]. Capt Carney
    stated that as far as he was concerned he would not make an investigation but
    undoubtedly some Air Force Agency would. Capt Carney was also asked whether or
    not he believed [redacted]'s story, naturally Capt Carney did not commit himself.

4.  On the morning of 9 September 1952, Capt Ruppelt, Capt Carney, and Lt
    Olsson took a staff car into West Palm Beach to attempt to find out more about
    Mr. [redacted]. Capt Carney and Capt Ruppelt called on the local F.B.I. Agent
    to determine whether or not they had possibly heard any rumors or could give
    any leads on the case. They stated that naturally they were not officially
    interested in the case and that they had received no directions from their
    higher authority to pursue the case. The F.B.I. agent did state, however, that


- page 30 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

he had picked up several rumors and passed these rumors on to Capt. Carney and
Capt. Huppelt. He stated that the best place to confirm some of these rumors
would be at the West Palm Beach or the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office. The
one rumor that was of most interest was that a doctor in West Palm Beach had
stated that he knew of some information and that he was very probably a mental case.

5. Capt. Huppelt and Capt. Carney then went to the Palm Beach County
Sheriff's office and contacted a Mr. Lawrence, the Chief Deputy. Mr. Lawrence
was unable to give too many details on the case. He stated that he had heard
some rumors about _______ but actually had never run them down himself. He
was also questioned as to the character of Mr. _______ who was a press
agent. He stated that Mr. _______ was possibly not too reliable in the fact that
he was a press agent with a doubtful reputation.

6. The officers next talked to a Mr. C. B. Bowen another deputy at the
Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Bowen was very much interested in the
case and had contacted some agency in Washington, possibly the F.B.I., and had
received Mr. _______ background record and was aware of the fact that he had
served time in the reformatory. He said that he did not personally know
Mr. _______ but his record was not exactly "clean". He stated that he
had no actual police record. He stated that a Dr. Byrd, a physician who was
called upon by the sheriff's office as a consultant, knew more about
Mr. _______ and that he should contact him. He also stated that he was 140
and that he trusted him and would believe anything he said. (Comment: This is
180 degrees out of phase with what the other deputy said.) He was also questioned
as to the general location and general aspects of the sighting. He stated that
contrary to other reports that we have had, there is absolutely no danger in
going through a palmetto grove at night. He stated that many times he has
crawled through these palmetto groves at night and that the danger of being
bitten by a rattlesnake is almost nil. (Comment: It had been previously stated
that _______ would have had to have some powerful motivating force to have
gone into the palmetto at night, however, according to the deputy this is not
necessarily true especially since _______ is familiar with the area.) He
also stated that there was a very small possibility that there had been a march
(mathane) in the area since it was a dry area. In addition, he stated that
one of the police officers who had met _______ that night was a Mr. Louis
Carroll, a constipation from West Palm Beach area, was not too reliable. He
stated that since the incident he had been on a case with Louis Carroll and
that Carroll had stated that he would like to make a "big deal" out of this
sighting. He stated something to the fact that he would take some pictures
of the burned trees and the burned ground and would have half of the Air Force
from Washington down there investigating. He then "poked" Mr. _______ jokingly
and said, "what do you think of the deal?" (Comment: He would have to take this
because nothing appeared to be burned.) It _______ took a very dim view of the whole
thing. _______ also gave the officer some leads as to where _______ had worked
and what contacts to make.

7. The next person to be contacted was a Mr. _______, a part-owner of
Hardware Store, where _______ is presently employed. Lt Olsson, Capt Carney, Capt Huppelt,
Capt Carney and a S/Sgt Ralph Seager of Capt Carney's office contacted Mr. _______.

Mr. [redacted] had nothing but praise for his good employees and he would hate to lose him. He stated that he is a very good employee and he would go out of his way to help him. The one excuse he was making sometime ago he (Mr. [redacted]) was constructing a greenhouse in his backyard. The construction was not completed and he had put a large tarpaulin over the roof of the greenhouse. One night when Mr. [redacted] and his family were away, a windstorm come up. It was a very violent windstorm and did quite a bit of damage in the West Palm Beach area. He stated that he wasn't aware of the severity of the storm at though when he returned he found his greenhouse had been damaged and that the tarpaulin was missing. The next morning [redacted] came over to his house with the tarpaulin and stated that he had crawled upon the roof that night and removed the tarp. He was very much interested because he stated that there had been a high wind, a lot of rain and lightning and the fact that the tarp had been rushing up against a 220 volt high tension line. The fact that he was not employed by Mr. [redacted] and was even unknown to him. (Comment: This tends to point up some of the aspects that will come up later about this incident.) Although he was not questioned about the whole thing, there is a possibility that the tarp had blown on the ground and that [redacted] was not as brave as he appeared to be.) All in all, Mr. [redacted] had nothing but praise for [redacted].

8. Mr. [redacted] of a City Service Gas Station in West Palm Beach was contacted next. He was interviewed by Capt Garsey and Lt Olsson. He stated that his only contact with [redacted] was that he had also operated a City Service Gas Station in the city of West Palm Beach. This was approximately two years ago. He stated that they were having a meeting of many dealers in the southern Florida area and [redacted] had gotten up and made some rather foolish statements. He did not elaborate on these statements and since it was obvious that he, did not especially care for [redacted], the interview was cut off since it appeared that personal opinions instead of facts were entering into the discussion.

9. Dr. [redacted], a physician in West Palm Beach, was contacted by Capt Gurney and Capt Ruppalt. Dr. [redacted] is retained by the Police Department as a consultant. He has been used many times on mental cases and although he is not a psychiatrist he is somewhat familiar with this aspect of medicine. He stated that he had several contacts with [redacted] and that he was the doctor who treated him when he was supposedly injured when an automobile fell on him. He stated that against his back, he was not sure of the date, which he working at a garage that sells Crosley automobiles in West Palm Beach and that an automobile had supposedly fallen off a hoist and landed on DeVergers. He stated that was taken to the hospital and completely paralyzed. The doctor said that he and three other doctors examined him very closely and took many x-rays. After this thorough examination, the concluded that there was absolutely nothing wrong with [redacted] physically. He continued to complain, however, that he was paralyzed, in great pain, etc. After several days, he was allowed to get up in a wheel chair. The doctor stated that during the time he was in the wheel chair that traveled all over the hospital, visited all of the offices and all

the patients, telling them how bad off he really was. This was creating a lot
of confusion in the hospital so the wheel chair was taken away from him and he was
given a pair of crutches. This didn't help matters very much as far as the con-
dition was concerned as he continued to go around telling people that he was in
bad condition. During this time he would telephone his mother who he had to have
been living in lakeland, Fla., and would tell his mother how he was entering
and what a bad condition he was in. This continued until Dr. [redacted] was
telephone call from [redacted] grandfather. The grandfather said that [redacted]
mother was in a near state of collapse because of these telephone calls end that
knowing his grandson, that he would if things were exactly the way he was telling
them. He requested that they refrain from letting [redacted] call his mother. The
doctor also stated that when [redacted] was released from the hospital, he went away
on a two week vacation. When he came back, he stated that during that two weeks, or
possibly a month, the doctor was not sure of which, or over how long a period of
time, [redacted] stated that he had broken his leg. The doctor said that from all
appearances he could not have broken his leg and recovered so fast. Dr. [redacted]
under the impression that [redacted] claimed paralysis, etc., strictly as a deal
to obtain insurance money. Dr. [redacted] was very emphatic in his views on this.
He said that he would hesitate to say the man was insane, however, he is definitely
mentally unbalanced. He kept using the word "exhibitionist" all of the time in
describing [redacted]. Had handled the insurance and could probably give us more information
on [redacted].

10. Mr. [redacted] was contacted next. He stated that his only connection with
[redacted] had been during his insurance claim that [redacted] had made. He stated
however, that he didn't remember the case very well and that the insurance company
had paid [redacted]. He said that he had received several letters from the company
requesting the status of the claim, etc., but that the insurance company
had closed it out and did not intend to pay. The question was asked as to
[redacted] background, however, he was not too familiar with the general aspects
of [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] suggested that a Mr. [redacted] who worked in the Beavers
Motor Company, who had previously employed [redacted] be contacted.

11. Mr. [redacted] was contacted by Capt Carney and Lt Olsson. He stated that
[redacted] had worked for their garage as a mechanic starting in July of 1950.
He stated that [redacted] was "a boy who never quite grew up". He owned
a Crosley automobile which had every known accessory attached to it and stated
that he couldn't go ten feet in the automobile without madly spinning the
wheels and that he was prone to exaggerate a great deal. He said that he
was very prone to exaggerate on all stories and that several times had done several
things that were rather shady*. One time there was a brand left in charge of the
office and the two other people left. There was a brand new engine for a Crosley
automobile in the shop when they left. When they came back they noticed that the
engine didn't appear to be the same one. When they got to checking serial number,
they found that during their absence, [redacted] switched the brand new motor
for the motor in his Crosley. He was never prosecuted for this, however. Another
time he had passed bad checks. He was employed by those people when the automobile
fell on his car the hoist.

12. After the interview with Mr. [redacted] the officers returned to West Palm Beach International Airport to Capt Carney's office. This was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and it was decided that Mr. [redacted] the press agent for [redacted] be contacted. It was understood that [redacted] was on vacation and that a cover for calling would be to try to locate him. Capt Carney stated that he had just left his office after conferring for two or three hours on the incident, and that he would be very glad to contact him. Capt Carney insisted that a little bit became he had not expected this answer but, did think of an excuse as to why he didn't urgently need to [redacted]. After this, we got Kiel into a discussion of the general subject of the incident and [redacted] that just that afternoon he had broken his contract with [redacted] and instead that [redacted] he had told him about his background and [redacted] that with such a background, no reputable editor in the United States would ever touch the story. Ha had also advised that [redacted] that if he wanted to back out, that he was all right, that he was going to stick to and attempt to sell the story. He stated that when it came time to release the story, the Air Force would back him up 100 percent. (Comment: Where [redacted] got this idea is strictly unknown to the Air Force.)

13. At approximately 1930 on 9 September 1952, Capt Ruppelt and Capt Carney attended a boy scout meeting in a church in West Palm Beach, Fla., in order to contact the three boy scouts who had observed this incident along with Mr. [redacted] who was the boy scout troop chairman. Dr. [redacted] sat in with Capt Ruppelt and Capt Carney. In general, the boy scouts were rather difficult to talk to. They were rather excited and nervous about the whole thing and in many cases their answers did not make a lot of sense. It is not believed that this was because they weren't telling the truth, but they were just youngsters and were a little bit nervous. Capt Ruppelt wore civilian clothes, however, Capt Carney was in uniform and the boys were rather impressed with the whole thing. All three boys collaborated the first part of the incident so it will be given as a recapitulation not repeating each of the three boys' stories. It seems that after the scout meeting, Mr. [redacted] took four boy scouts in his car with the idea of taking them home. The boys were not so straight home, however. First went out to a place called the "Wagon Wheel" which is a drive-in soda fountain. They had a cold drink and proceeded in the direction of a drive-in theatre west of West Palm Beach. The boys were under the impression that [redacted] was taking them to the drive-in, however, they stated that something happened and they decided not to go to the drive-in theatre but to go out to a speedway. (Comment: The boys were pinned down to try to find out what had happened to make them change their minds, however, they were very vague about this point. This was the only time in the interview that they seemed to be attempting to cover up something. It was not determined exactly what they were trying to cover up, if anything. They stated at the speedway which is used for stock car racing and stated that they were going to see how much water was on the track from the recent rain. There was no one else at the track and there were no races in progress at the time. They stayed at the track for several minutes and then started back down military trail toward the

boys' homes. (Comment: It seemed rather odd to the interrogating officers that 
they would go to an abandoned race track just to see how much water there was on 
the track. One possible explanation is that one of the boy's fathers has something 
to do with the stock car races and it might have been that they were just interested 
in the track. Secondly, the officers were informed that 16 to 18 policy to take 
the boy scouts on trips around the city of West Palm Beach to show them different 
factories, plants, etc. However, this does not satisfactorily account for the 
fact that they would go off to a deserted race track.) One of the boy scouts 
was taken home before the incident. His name was not obtained and since he was 
not involved no effort was made to find out who he was.

14. As and the three boy scouts were driving south on military 
trail, they approached a point where supposedly observed the object. 
The first thing that happened was that on the night of 16 Aug 52, he 
of the boy scouts saw this light. At that time stopped his automobile, 
got out, and recovered two machetes, or two knives, and two flashlights from the 
trunk of his car. The boys made him wish he was going to do and that he 
had thought he had seen either an aircraft crack up or a flying saucer. The boys 
however, were afraid and convinced that he shouldn't go back into the 
woods and that they should go on. At this time he started back to the 
road when one of the boy scouts by the name of claimed that he saw 
white lights back toward the spot where they had originally seen the lights. At 
this time they stopped and went back. He took out his flashlight and two machetes 
all he was carrying was one machete and two flashlights. He gave the boys instruc-
tions to go get help if he wasn't back in ten minutes and started into the woods. 
The boys claimed that they could see his flashlight going back into the woods. 
From this point on, the boys' stories varied to a certain degree so that each 
one will be given separately.

15. The first boy that was interrogated was approximately 12 yrs. old, a rather large boy for his age, and appeared to be 
bullipgrant to a certain extent. He seemed to be the leader of the group and 
everything he said was law. He didn't seem to be cooperative on the whole 
thing and whenever he was pressed for an answer he would "clean up". He kept 
stating, "Well that's what I said, so it must be the truth." He states 
that he did not see the first light, but a few hours, shortly after-
wards, after had got out, made the statement about seeing flying saucers, 
and got back into the automobile that he looked out of the window and 
saw a semi-circle of white lights about three inches in diameter going down at 
an angle of 45 degrees into the trees. None of the other boy scouts saw this. 
They turned the car around, went back to the spot and stopped. He then said 
that he saw rock formation, this point being that the next thing that he 
saw was a series of red lights in the clearing. It is interesting to note that 
he definitely said he saw the lights on a clearing and as will be shown further 
along in this memorandum, this point is highly doubtful. As soon as he saw the 
red lights he claims that he saw "stirred up" and fall. was then 
dismissed and the officer, in the presence of Dr. the troop chairman, talked 
to a and together. who was 11 yrs. old tested

to be rather silly about the whole thing. He couldn't seem to concentrate on
his answers and was not considered a good source. [redacted], on the other
hand, although he was the youngest of the three, seemed to be the most logical
thinker and gave the straightest answers. Both of these boys seemed to have
their own story. They were driving down the road when [redacted] saw the
first light. [redacted] stopped the car and got out, but admitted
that he was afraid of the whole thing and wanted to go on, consequently, they
went on. Than [redacted] saw a white light, however, he states it looked to him
like it was a common, ordinary meteor. After this, turned the car
around, went back down the road and stopped. They [redacted] never did see any
white lights that he could remember. They both saw [redacted] going through
the woods, could see flashlights flashing on the trees and then he disappeared
for a few seconds, at least the light disappeared. The next thing they saw was
a series of red lights. They said they looked a lot like flares or sky rockets,
the lights were not making any definite pattern, some of them were going up,
some of them were going down, or going around and around in all directions. It
just seemed to be a type of six or eight red lights going in all directions.
They got out of the car and ran down the road to get help. The boys stated
that upon arrival at the farm house, they told the people their scout
master was in trouble and to make a phone call, which the people did. Soon
afterwards the people asked what the boys had seen and they told their story
of the light to the people before either the sheriff or [redacted] showed up.

16. All in all the boys' stories were rather conflicting and it was very
difficult to obtain any facts. The only one fact that seemed to stand out in all
of their minds was the fact that they did see red lights out in the palmetto grove
after [redacted] had gone in.

17. After the boy scouts were interrogated, a long discussion was held with
Dr. [redacted], scout troop chairman. He stated that his first contact with
was when he contacted him to see if he would be scout master. Dr. [redacted]
that he is a member of the local Optimist Club and that the Optimist Club had
decided to sponsor a scout troop and appointed him as chairman. He was looking
around for a scout master and heard that [redacted] would be interested in such
a job. He contacted [redacted] and [redacted] said that he would take it.
this time, [redacted] knew nothing about [redacted] character or background and the only
thing that he had ever heard about him was that he had been in an automobile accident
(i.e., the automobile had slipped off a hoist and hit him) and that he had been
very ill for a while. He stated that he first noticed [redacted] was not exactly
normal acting one night when [redacted] came over to [redacted]'s house to help him
paint a cabinet they were making for the boy scout's meeting headquarters. He
stated that at that time, he was rather surprised that a rather tall tale about a son
who was at that time about four months old. He said that the child, although
he is only four months old, could walk and talk and had a number of teeth. This
doctor knew that this was rather absurd and couldn't figure out why [redacted]
would tell such a story. He was even interested enough to make a special effort
to see the child, not that he believed [redacted], but he seemed to want to double
check the story. He stated that after he saw the child, he was under the impression

that the baby was strictly normal for a four month old child, Dr. also
noted that several nights after the incident, attended a scout meet-
ing which was also attended by many of the scouts' parents. With no invitation,
he got up and said that since they were all interested in his experience that
he would answer questions. When someone did ask a question he stated that he
couldn't answer it because of his "secrecy agreement". He also stated that what
he knew might create a panic. He told several other incidents that he had heard
from Keesler and suggested that we contact a Mr. of the Plumbing
Company.

13. On the morning of 10 September 1952, Capt. Barney and Capt. Tagnalt along
with Lt. Olsson proceeded to the Hardware Store to talk to Mr. who said that
Mr. also called in his brother, who knew about the incident. They said that
they first met at Riverside in September 1941. They stated that they got to know
students from one state to get to know each other and since they were from
Lake City, Fla., they naturally got acquainted with him. They said he was
"kind of wild", "fun-loving", and "a prankster". They said that they were familiar
enough with him that they used to invite him to their home in West Palm Beach
on weekends. They stated that he pulled several pranks while he was at the
military academy, one of the most outstanding ones was dying his hair. They
stated that at one time the boys were all complaining about the type of food
that they were getting at the academy so in protest, many of them dyed their
hair red. After he went one better by dying his hair green. After he had
done this, he changed colors several times and dyed his hair so many times his
hair began to fall out. He stated that they do not know exactly what happened
to him but the last they heard of him at the military academy was that he had
gone AWOL and as far as they knew never finished high school. They stated that
he does claim, however, to have gone to the University of Florida. If this is
true, he would have had to have graduated from some high school. They are not
aware, however, whether or not he really graduated. They stated that the next
time they saw him was about a year ago. He had just finished working in the
garage and had had his accident. He told them that he had had an accident and
that a car had fallen on him and that he lay under the car for several hours screaming for help but nobody could hear him and he had suffered a great deal of pain.
(Comment: This was closed on and found that he was no lying under the car for
several hours, that there had been help right there when he had fallen.) He talked
to the and related some of the things he had been doing. He said that since
the had been that he had been driving automobiles in stock car races. He said
that he had won all of the races in southern Florida circuit by driving a Crosley
in a modified stock car. Soon after this, a City Service
Gas Station close to the opened and other service station close to the came and offered to
service their trucks for them and since they knew him, they switched all their
business to him. He made big statements as to how much service he would give
them, how he would polish their trucks, and everything else. He did do this
for about two weeks. However, after two weeks he didn't do it anymore. He
operated the gas station for several months until he began to get into financial
troubles. They stated that they believed his had overestimated his station and was
unable to meet his bills. The bulk gas truck refused to deliver gas to his except

Burned by a Flying Saucer

The amazing story of a man who chased mysterious lights and came face to face with the terror

by Marta Robinet

I'd heard about Sonny DeVergers' encounter with the flying saucer. The whole country had. The news had flashed out from West Palm Beach, Florida, the night of August 19, 1952 - a 30-year-old scoutmaster had entered a palmetto forest to investigate strange lights and, after 40 terrifying minutes, had come staggering back, his arms burned, mumbling dazedly of a strange craft that hovered above the ground and a creature beyond his comprehension.

It was another saucer story, stored away by the Air Technical Intelligence Center, forgotten within 24 hours after it found its spot in the news.

Hoax? Psychological aberration? Hallucination? Publicity stunt? Or none of these? Was it one of those unaccountable saucer experiences reported by honest, reputable persons which even the Air Force, checking relentlessly, cannot puncture?

I was introduced to DeVergers a few months had passed since DeVergers' brush with the unknown. How much could he remember of it now? Had it had any effect on him? What did it feel like to be so close to a flying saucer that you could reach up and actually touch it?

I saw Deputy Sheriff Mott Partin, who'd been there when Sonny DeVergers staggered from the woods. He was a small, alert, practical man, fatherly and friendly. "I'd be the first to think DeVergers had been drinking," he said.

Partin answered, shaking his head. "In 19 years of law enforcement, I've never seen anyone as upset as he was."

He said he would drive me down to the Dixie Highway that afternoon to talk to DeVergers. Bobby Puffing, one of the three Boy Scouts DeVergers had been driving with, would go so to Boynton to see DeVergers.

Sonny DeVergers points to where his arm was blistered and burned. The sparks, also burned, came from a ball of fire that he claims pursued him.

(Continued from page 41)

We laughed. Then Partin asked, "Did you ever get your cap back from Washington?"

Sonny appeared startled to have this mentioned in front of me.

Partin said, "This will interest you. His cap was burned. That sent it away for analysis."

Sonny said, no, he hadn't gotten it back yet. We set the time for the interview and left.

"These people who scoff should have seen the cap," Partin said, when we were under way again. "It was a yachting cap. The hole in the bill hadn't burned through, but two in the cloth had. He said that when the thing shot at him there were sparks."

We came into the town of Boynton, turned into a homey residential street and stopped again. We spoke to Mrs. Ruffing first, explaining why I was there. A quiet spoken, attractive woman with a sincere, level glance, she was frankly hesitant as she peered out at us from behind her screen door.

"Bobby has been in bed with the flu," she explained, then added, "I'll see if he wants to talk."

She reappeared and led us into a room charming with bright chintz, Bobby was on a davenport, under covers.

"He's an intelligent lad," Partin had told me before we arrived. "He's older than the other two Scouts. I was particularly impressed with the way he gave me his story that night."

Bobby's reticence to discuss the affair was marked. He kept looking towards his mother.

"Sonny had been in the habit of bringing Bobby home after Scout meeting," she began for him. "When Bobby didn't get home that night, we were terribly worried. It didn't help much when we got the call that they are at the sheriff's office."

"Why don't you want to talk about it?" I asked.

He looked straight at me. "I've been teased at school," he said simply. He studied his hands.

"I wish it had never happened," he said, word for word Sonny's statement.

They'd been driving down Military Trail toward Boynton, he said, when Sonny first saw the lights. There were six or so of them, strung in a level row, like the windows of an airliner, and they

Bobby Ruffing and two other Boy Scouts saw the same lights as DeVergers. Bobby, who says, "I wish it had never happened," reluctantly allows Deputy Sheriff Mott Partin the size of the lights. There were about six, strung out happened, he said solemnly. "I like my job. I have six months to feed." Six! That surprised me. I asked him, "How come so many?" His eyes crinkled. He ticked off the list on his fingers. "Me, my wife, boy, dog, bird, goldfish."

in advance that there were some details he would withhold, "I'm not here to challenge," I said. "Just tell me your story."

He had run into the woods with his lantern and machete, he said, leaving the boys by the car. He looked up at the stars for his bearings.

"I went about 200 yards," he said. "In Florida there are apt to be swarmy areas and quicksand. When thick palmetto growth stops abruptly you can step into anything. When I realized I was in a clearing, I kept my eyes on the ground. I walked about 20 feet into the clearing and stopped."

He stopped talking and looked at me. "It was a funny thing. I had the feeling I wasn't alone. Nothing to account for it. Just a feeling. And suddenly the atmosphere was insufferably hot.

"I looked up at the stars. Darned funny... it was black up there. There were no stars. I shone my lantern upward. About four feet above my head there was a dirtyish gray metal surface. I couldn't have been more than a few seconds. I stood looking, but it was all so clear. I remember noticing that the metal's grain ran north to south and there were no seams."

"You'd walked in under it?" I asked.

"I could have touched it with my machete. My whole body tightened up with fear. I remember thinking, 'Get out of here!' I must have been very close to the outer rim of the thing because, when I hurriedly backed off, I was in the open and the thing seemed to be backing off from me at the same time. Like it was taken by surprise. I could see the silhouette against the sky... dome-shaped with a flat bottom, about 30 feet across. There were no lights. The rim began to tilt up."

He stopped again, groping for some way to go on.

I remembered the original story. "Did you see some?" I asked.

He thought about that. "Yes," he said, at last.

A living creature? Would he describe what it looked like? No, he said emphatically, that was one of the things he wouldn't tell me. People would think... well, he'd just rather not.

"I saw it when an opening suddenly appeared in the dome," he said. "It was like a hatch that flew open. And at the same time that I saw it, a ball of fire drifted toward me from the opening. It's hard to describe... it was a kind of misty fire that gave off sparks. It seemed to float toward me and envelop me and a stenchy filled my nostrils and throat. I threw my arms up over my face. Then I staggered and fell and everything went black."

When he came to, the thing was gone. Just black stillness. He was dazed and his arms hurt and his throat was raw.

"I was afraid I was dead," he told me. "Really," he emphasized, as if fearful I would not believe him, "I thought I was dead. I didn't seem to be walking on ground. I couldn't even feel the ground. My whole body was numb. All I could think of was the bits, white feeling my way in the darkness. I made it to the car. I don't remember what I said. Afterwards they told me I still had my machete."

He said, there, his story ended. I made some small talk about the bird and the goldfish. I wanted to leave, so Sonny's wife (who had left us alone during our interview) could come home and they could turn out the lights and go to bed and forget once more. And though he said nothing, I could feel his yearning to be believed, his desperate, unspoken plea for my faith.

I shook his hand and thanked him and went out. The stars were bright and symbolic of all the mystery of the future. I thought of Sonny DeVergers' story, and what Bobby Mott had said, and the supporting testimony of Mott Partin. I thanked God that I was not a judge and jury charged with ruling on whether the scantmaster did or did not actually come face to face with a flying saucer. I had only to set the facts down, as I have done here.

But I will tell you this: I have complete faith in the integrity of all three—DeVergers, Bobby and Pat.

plunged right into the woods. Sonny thought it
was a plane crashing. Excited, they talked of in-
vestigating the strange sight.

A quarter of a mile further on, Bobby saw the
lights again. Now they seemed to be right in the
tree tops, back about where they'd first been
spotted. Sonny turned around and went back a
quarter of a mile.

He got out his lantern, pocket flash and machete
—for hacking through the underbrush.

"If you don't hear from me in 10 minutes, go
back up the road to that house and call the
sheriff's office," he told the three Scouts. Then he
plunged down the road embankment and off into
the woods, his lantern bobbing between the trees.
When he failed to return, Bobby and the other
two boys ran to the house and called the sheriff's
office. Partin, who was cruising nearby, was con-
tacted by radio and reached the scene about half
an hour after Sonny's departure. While he was
trying to get a story from the boys, Sonny suddenly
appeared at the bottom of the embankment,
white-faced and shaking and kept re-
peating: "I'm coming, here I am!" His lantern
was gone, but he still had his machete.

"He was a sorry sight," Partin put in. "He
was talking a blue streak but didn't make any

sense. I backed away from
him. That machete . . ."

Mrs. Ruffing said she'd
seen Sonny's singed arms.
He'd come down the next
evening to apologize for
making Bobby late. She'd
seen a seeping blister near
his watchband and he
had mentioned a tingling
feeling in his arms.

We said good-by to the
Ruffings and drove back
down Military Trail. We
stopped, just before sun-
set, where Sonny had
stopped that night. We
went through the woods
—those lonely, dismal
palmetto thickets—to the
clearing where Sonny had
known terror. I saw
where his lantern had
been found, where he fell to his elbows had made an imprint
where burned patches had been.

It was good to leave that grim place. Three
hours later, I sat with Sonny DeVergers in his

wife and dog were absent. I studied his honest
face. Here was a man reluctant to relive an un-
pleasant experience, yet determined not to run
from it. He warned me (Continued on page 20)

FLYING BOWL? AIR FORCE PROBES EX-MARINE'S ENCOUNTER WITH ONE

By The Associated Press
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A deputy sheriff and two Boy Scouts added details here today to an ex-Marine's story of his encounter with a strange object in wooded area Tuesday night and in Washington an Air Force spokesman said an officer had been sent to check on the incident, but no conclusion had been reached.

The deputy sheriff and Boy Scouts told of scorched grass, strange lights and showers of sparks in the area where D. S. Desvergers, thirty, hard-bitten, salesmen, former Marine, said he was questioned last night at the West Palm Beach International Airport by Washington Air Force officials who refused to identify.

The Scoutmaster has described the object he encountered as shaped "like half a rubber ball," about three feet thick at the edges and high enough at the center for a man to stand erect inside.

He was quoted as telling a Palm Beach reporter today that he knows what the object was, but added, "it's better for me not to go any further for the public good."

Because it might cause panic, Mr. Desvergers reported he was taking three Scouts home Tuesday night when he stopped to investigate lights in the heavy woods. He said when he flashed his light on the object, he was blasted by the ball of fire and overcome.

Deputy Sheriff Mott N. Partin summoned by the Scouts, said their hair was singed and three holes were burned in his cap. He also said he found evidence of scorched grass where the Scoutmaster said he encountered the object.

One of the Scouts, Charles Stevens, said the group saw a "big glowing white light come down out of the sky."

In Washington, the Air Force spokesman said an officer had been sent to the scene from Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. The center has the responsibility of analyzing the reports of unusual aerial objects.

The Air Force spokesman said "we cannot tell yet just what it was there." He added: "We spoke to the man, but we had nothing new to add which would base a conclusion. We are going to continue to check up, and so get all the facts together."

on a C.O.D. basis. During one of these gas deliveries, had brought
a check to be cashed so he could pay the gas man. They cashed
the check, but it bounced. Shortly thereafter, the gasoline company claimed down
on him, the city cut the water supply off, etc., and he closed the station. After
this, his automobile was repossessed and for all practical purposes he went bankrupt.

19. He had told the about his discharge from the Marines and his
story was that after he got back from overseas he landed in California. He saw
an ad in the paper that someone wanted a person to share the driving from Cali-
fornia to Florida. He started that when he got to North Florida with this person
that the person disappeared and it turned out that the car was a stolen car and
was picked up. (Comment: One or the other sources stated that)
a story was that he was out in California and that he and a friend had picked
up a couple girls and were driving along when the police stopped them. He stated
that he had not known this friend very well and it turned out that the friend and
two girls had stolen the car but they got out of the charge.) The had
said that they had seen several times after he closed his gas station and
that he had invited them over to his house on two or more occasions. They
stated that the first inkling they began to have was that something was a little
odd was the stories that was told. They repeated their stories and they
will be noted here for possible value and psychological study. They stated that
they understood the Miami Daily Herald had also picked up a story that
supposedly saw some person jump off the roof of a building in New York City sometime
ago but upon looking for the body the police could not find it. He then had some
long story which they did not remember the circumstances of the disappearance of the
body. In this instance he also supposedly hired a press agent.

20. Once during a birthday party stated that during the war
he was a Marine and had been on a battleship. He stated that one day
he was contacted by an officer of Naval Intelligence who asked him to go on a
secret mission. He was taken to Washington and given a briefing by a group of
Colonels then taken to California to go to school with some more Colonels from
Washington. He was flown to the Pacific to map the Japanese held islands that were
uncharted. He stated that he was taken to the island under cover of darkness
in a PBY aircraft along with his surveying cryptography equipment and that as they
approached the island a life raft was inflated and thrown out of the waist window
of the PBY. The PBY landed in the dark in uncharted waters next to the raft
and put and his equipment into the raft. With the cover of darkness he
paddled up to the beach and buried all of his equipment. With the story he stated that at
the beginning of the story the island was 7 x 3 mi. long and at the end, it was
25 x 50. After about two weeks of hiding from the Japs all day and digging up
his equipment and surveying at night, he had mapped the island. In many cases
he had brushes with Japanese officers and once during his two weeks he was laying
in some bushes hiding during the day when the Japs walked by so close to him that
could touch him. When the job was finished he had set up a rendezvous with the
PBY and it landed at night. However, the Japs saw the airplane land and knew that
he was on the island. He inflated his rubber raft and started paddling toward the
aircraft but the Japanese started to fire at him and sunk his life raft, however,

Here is the OCR text from the document:

in the raft he had a Gibson Girl radio with a balloon for an antenna. He quickly inflated the balloon, crawled on it and flowed out to the FBI. As he was being picked up by the aircraft, people were reaching down out of the hatch helping him. During the time the Japs were shooting at them and several of the sailors who were helping him were badly wounded. Another one of his stories was that shortly afterwards he was discharged. One the following night when he was alone, a hold-up man came in with a 45 and attempted to rob him. However, he talked to the hold-up man and talked him out of the robbery, took his gun away from him and gave him enough money to take the bus out of town.

21. Another story was that he had been a PG lost pilot in the Marines and had flown about every type of naval and marine fighter aircraft. It so happened that the brothers are civilian pilots and started to question him about flying. They said it was very, very obvious to them that he had never been in an airplane before.

22. They stated that in general they seemed to always have a story that would top one told by anybody else. They said that he was very clever and that he always had a very convincing answer for everything. They said it was next to impossible to be able to pin him down on anything and asked him a question that he could not answer. They stated that they believed him absolutely because he had passed several bad checks and they were always made good shortly afterwards. They said that as far as they know he has several new automobiles while in West Palm Beach and one of them was repossessed and that he had purchased two homes. There was a question in their minds as to where he could get enough money to make down payments on a new car and a home. They stated that the general impression around the city of West Palm Beach was about 60 percent of the people believed it; and the rest just laughed it all off. They said that personally they were very much interested in flying saucers and followed it very closely, however, they did not believe this story. If anybody except he had seen it, they said they probably would have believed it, however, they put absolutely no faith in anything that he said.

23. They stated that in several cases they have either been in the presence of or have heard that was at a meeting and would voluntarily bring up his experiences. When asked details he would immediately bring up his "secrecy agreement" with the Air Force and not give any details.

24. On the evening of 9 September 1952, Capt Nugent, Capt Carney, Lt Olsson, and S/Sgt Seager went out to the spot where supposedly observed the object. The night was much the same as the night of the incident, no moon and clear time. The staff car was parked in approximately the same spot as car was parked. Lt Olsson and S/Sgt Seager took a flashlight and went out into the clearing where was "attacked". The light was visible while the two men were going into the woods, however, when they not into the clearing then could not be seen. The only time the light could be seen was when Lt Olsson would hold the light about 7 feet above the ground and shined it directly toward the road. It

was definitely concluded that a person in the clearing, holding a light at a
normal level, could not be seen from the road. It is doubted that the palmettos
grew that much taller in a three week period. (Comment: This male made about
three weeks after the incident.)

While at the scene of the incident, it was noted that aircraft in the traffic
pattern at the West Palm Beach Airport with landing lights on appeared to be white
lights going through the woods. Aircraft in the Palm Beach area keep their landing
lights on at all times they are in the pattern.

Memorandum for Record                                                26 August 1952

Subject: Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Object Reported by Mr. [redacted]

1. On 26 Aug 52, Capt Ruppelt of ATIC-5 telephoned Capt Carney, Intelligence Officer of the 1707th Air Base Wing, West Palm Beach International Air Fort (telephone number 36401, extension 234). Capt Ruppelt asked that the answers to the following questions be obtained and airmailed to ATIC as soon as possible.

a. Is Palm Beach County Airport used for night operations? Does the log show any landings on the night of 19 Aug 52 between 2100 and 2300? What were the exact time of the landings?

b. What was the detailed weather at Palm Beach on the 19th between 1800 and 2400? Pay special attention to thunder storms in the area and cloud cover. Were there any sea clouds or ground fog? Get temperature and humidity.

c. A Capt Zahn, Air Drone Officer on the 22 Aug, mentioned airmen on the line seeing flares. Get complete story.

d. Did or has the tower at West Palm Beach seen any flares in the area of the sighting? Get details.

e. Did the boyscouts tell the police their story before they met [redacted]? What did they say?

f. Did the boyscouts tell their story to the people in the house? What did they say?

g. At what locations in Florida are there Navy blimps stationed?

h. Did the deputies smell any odor when they went in to find [redacted] flashlight?

i. Was there any indication that [redacted] that could have been burned before he went into the woods?

2. In addition to this, Capt Carney was questioned as to the late press


- page 51 -

releases that Mr. [redacted] has acquired the services of a press agent. He stated that he had talked to [redacted] about 11:00 on the 25th of Aug and that [redacted] did not intend to hold any information or any further questioning from the Air Force. [redacted] stated that the entire setup was that of his press agent to build the story up so that he could sell it.

3. Capt Carney also mentioned that a farmer who owned the land where the sighting place did believe that the grass was singed and that he had supposedly taken samples of the grass and sent them to some research organization in St. Louis to be analyzed. He also stated that this farmer had received several threatening telephone calls and had noticed a large black automobile cruising around near his house. Capt Carney stated that he had no idea what this all meant and that there is a possibility that it was part of the publicity stunt that [redacted] seemed to be about to pull.

Memorandum for Record                                                   19 September 1952

Subject: Telephone Call to Capt Carney, 1707th Air Base Wing, West Palm Beach
Municipal Airport, Florida

1. On 18 Sept 52, Capt B. J. Ruppelt called Capt Carney, Wing Intelligence
Officer of the 1707th Air Base Wing, West Palm Beach Municipal Airport, Florida,
to obtain additional information on a sighting reported by Mr. [redacted]. The
following questions and answers were obtained:

Q: Which deputy met [redacted] coming out of the palmetto thicket on
the night of the incident?

A: Lemty Nott Perkins.

Q: Were the samples of grass that were taken 50 yds from the location
of the sighting taken from a definitely shady spot or a spot that was in the
same rolling amount of sunshine as the point where [redacted] claimed to have
been "attacked"?

A: The grass samples had been taken from a point where there was
approximately the same amount of shade.

Q: Was [redacted] hat ever washed or ironed before it was supposedly
burned during the incident?

A: Capt Carney did not know the answer to this but said that he would
obtain it. He was requested to be rather discreet about this inquiry so that
[redacted] would have no idea we thought there was a possibility that the hat
might have been scorched while it was being ironed. Carney stated that he would
obtain the info and wire it directly to ATIC.

2. Capt Carney was also requested to pass on any information that he might
obtain in regard to the [redacted] sighting.

ROAD                 PHONE
WEST PALM BEACH, FLA.

We were heading south on Military Trail at about one quarter mile south of Lantana Road when we saw a big glare of white light and then it went out. stopped the car and got out.                     persuaded him to come back to the car and we started south again.

When we were a half mile further south we looked back and saw six red lights where we had seen the white light. We turned around and headed north. Then                 stopped the car and armed with a machete and two lights started into the woods. He was gone about seven minutes when we saw something like a flame thrower shooting flame or something that looked like Roman Candles. In a few seconds everything went dim including                 We waited a few minutes and then we turned the car lights on bright and ran to the nearest house and called the Highway Patrol.

EXCERPTS FROM FRANK EDWARDS BROADCAST -- AUGUST 25, 1952
MUTUAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM

WASHINGTON -- A BRINKS ARMORED CAR WAS APPARENTLY LOOTED OF $65,000 TODAY WHILE THE FOUR GUARDS WERE AT LUNCH. THE CAR, PARKED BEHIND THE YARDMAN PARK HOTEL, CONTAINED AN ADDITIONAL $200,000 WHICH THE THIEVES DID NOT TOUCH. A TOUCH OF MYSTERY WAS ADDED TO THE CRIME BY THE FACT THAT THE TRUCK WAS PARKED IN PLAIN SIGHT OF SEVERAL WORKMEN...BUT NO ONE SAW THE CRIME PERPETRATED. BRINKS OFFICIALS REPORT THAT THE TRUCK WAS LOCKED WHEN THE GUARDS RETURNED TO IT...AND THAT A MAN WEARING A UNIFORM SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE GUARDS WAS SEEN LOITERING IN THE VICINITY.

IF THIS TURNS OUT TO HAVE BEEN A ROBBERY, IT BEARS MANY OF THE EARMARKS OF THE MILLION DOLLAR BRINKS ROBBERY IN BOSTON...WHICH IS STILL UNSOLVED. IN THE BOSTON CASE THE THIEVES WORE UNIFORMS AND HANDLED THE LOCKS DOORS WITH EASE.

WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. -- SPECIAL -- OVER THE WEEKEND, NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE NATION CARRIED A REPORT THAT A YOUNG SCOUTMASTER IN WEST PALM BEACH HAD ENCOUNTERED SOME SORT OF STRANGE FLYING OBJECT IN THE WOODS NEAR THAT CITY. HE REPORTED THAT THE THING HOVERED JUST OFF THE EARTH AND THAT WHEN HE TURNED HIS FLASHLIGHT ON IT...HE WAS GREETED WITH A SORT OF ROMAN CANDLE EFFECT WHICH BURNED A SMALL HOLE IN HIS HAT. FURTHERMORE, HE NOW TELLS NEWSMEN THAT HE CAN'T GIVE THEM ANY MORE DETAILS...BECAUSE, HE SAYS, PENTAGON OFFICIALS WON'T LET HIM.

IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE YOUNG SCOUTMASTER WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE HAD THIS REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE NOW HAS A PUBLICITY AGENT...AND IS TRYING TO SELL HIS STORY TO SOME MAGAZINE. THE AIR FORCE OFFICER WHO FLEW TO WEST PALM BEACH TO INTERVIEW HIM SAYS THERE IS NO RESTRICTION OF ANY KIND...IN FACT, SAID THIS AIR FORCE OFFICER: "THAT YOUNG MAN IS FREE TO TELL THAT STORY TO ANYONE WHO CARES TO HEAR IT...AT ANY TIME."

NO NEWS PROGRAM THESE DAYS WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A GENEROUS PORTION OF POLITICS...SO HERE IS TODAY'S MEASURE:

IN NEW YORK CITY, GENERAL DWIGHT EISENHOWER ADDRESSED THE 34TH ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN LEGION IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. IN AN ADDRESS WHICH HAD BEEN AWAITED AS NON-POLITICAL, THE GENERAL DELIVERED HIS SHARPEST BARBS AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION. HE ACCUSED THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION OF "RECKLESS STARTS, FRACTIONAL ADVANCES, LOUD POLICIES AND FAINT DEEDS." HE DENOUNCED CORRUPTION AT ALL LEVELS...WARNING RUSSIA AGAINST AGGRESSION AND DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL THE ENSLAVED MILLIONS UNDER COMMUNIST DOMINATION HAVE BEEN FREED.

FOLLOWING THE GENERAL'S SPEECH, THERE WAS A PROLONGED DEMONSTRATION SIMILAR TO THOSE SEEN AT POLITICAL CONVENTIONS. DELEGATES WAVED THEIR BANNERS, STAMPED THEIR FEET, WHISTLED AND SCREAMED. IT REQUIRED ABOUT 20 MINUTES FOR THE COMMOTION TO SUBSIDE.

BUT THE GENERAL'S SPEECH TODAY WAS DELIVERED AGAINST A BACKDROP OF CRITICISM FROM HIS OWN CAMP. THE SCRIPPS-HOWARD NEWSPAPERS WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO ENDORSE THE GENERAL FOR THE PRESIDENCY. TODAY THEY CARRIED A CRITICAL EDITORIAL ENTITLED "LIKE, WHEN DO WE START?" THE EDITORIAL SAYS IN PART: "WE TRUST THAT DWIGHT EISENHOWER DOES NOT THINK THAT WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING IS CAMPAIGNING...HIS PAST MONTH CAN CLASSIFY AS CAMPAIGNING FOR OFFICE...FOR THOSE LITTLE MILK AND WATER REMARKS HE HAS BEEN MAKING AT PRESS CONFERENCES HAVE MADE HIM NO VOTES." THE SCRIPPS-HOWARD EDITORIAL SAYS THAT THE 19 PAPERS IN ITS CHAIN ACROSS THE NATION CONTINUE IN THEIR FAITH IN THE GENERAL'S QUALIFICATIONS...BUT THEY FEEL THAT HE HAS DONE LITTLE TO FORTIFY THE LITTLE THAT HE CAN WIN. SAYS THE EDITORIAL: "MIKE IS RUNNING LIKE A DRY CREEK."

Case

On 28 Aug 52, Thursday, P.M., I went to the Flare and Signal Branch in Building 156 and talked to Lt Berger and several others concerning the possibility of [redacted] hat and arms being burned by a flare.

From the pictures of the scorched hat and arms they gave the opinion that a flare could have done the job. Small molten particles drop off from flares as they pass through the air and could have caused the 3 pinhole burns in the cap. The scorch on the brim was harder to explain, but Lt Berger said that one passing just over his head might have given the iron-scorch effect.

There are 2 types of flares generally used, all shot from a Very Pistol-parachute type 2-non-parachute type. The hand flare with the pistol is also used. Red, white and blue are the colors, with red used the most. The flares burn at an intense heat 1000° F and upwards and can burn skin badly. We discharged two outside and one started a small grass fire. It seems likely that if a flare was used in the incident at West Palm, a fire would have started in the dry grass. No evidence of a flare was present down there, as far as we could see.

I told Berger and the other flare experts the whole story and they were interested, particularly in the slow-moving red ball or fire shot at him. They said a parachute flare floating down could cause this illusion. Arching from the near by high tension wires was mentioned as a possibility also. (A flare usually turns all the way to the ground.)

A significant fact lies in the fact that the parachute flare canister of rotten eggs immediately after it was shot off and this smell lingered in the canister for 2 hours afterward. There was too much wind to establish if the smell was in the area of the firing.

Flare people offered to help Project Blue Book at any time in the future.

On 21 August 1952 at approximately 8:40 A.M. Major Fournet of the D/I called Captain Ruppelt and asked whether or not we had received a wire from West Palm Beach, Florida. ATIC had not received the report and Major Fournet was so advised and stated that he could not read the report over the phone. However, he did ask that someone go to Florida and find out the answers to the following questions:-

1. What was the chemical analysis of the cup and remains of the clothes ash?

2. Examine the forearm.

3. Examine the ground with a Geigercounter.

4. Reinterrogate the three boyscouts and determine the altitude at which they first saw the blob.

5. What vegetation is in the area?

6. Was the flashlight on the ground near his hand when he regained consciousness?

7. Is the scout master subject to fainting spells?

8. All circumstances surrounding the sighting, such as:
   a. How far away were the three boyscouts?
   b. What caused them to look up?
   c. What was the purpose of the trip?
   d. How far were they away from the scout master?

28 August 1952

Captain Ruppelt,

These remarks should clear up the questions which you asked in our recent telephone conversation.

Lenteria Airport is used for night landings but none are on record for the night in question.

Weather Palm Beach 1600 to 2,000 hours, 19 August 1952:
1600 - 1920   2,500 to 3,600 ft. Broken, thunderstorms west, occasional rain at station. Temp. 80 falling to 76, Relative Humidity 87 to 92.
1920 - 2130   3,000 ft. northeast, 14 climbing visibility mainly south-east, Temp. 76, Rel Humidity 93.
1930 - 2300   3,000 ft scattered, no lightning visible, Temp. 75, Rel Humidity 93 - 100.
No low clouds or ground fog at station.

Capt ZINN, re: red flares on 21 Aug 52, Could not locate.

No red flares or unusual occurrences sighted by tower personnel during past two weeks.

People living where boys used phone and Deputy Sheriff Watt MARTIN say boys told them about lights and red flares before coming into contact with Sonny.

Persons living directly across the road from place where sighting occurred were contacted and stated they did not arrive home until after the incident occurred.

Deputy Partin states that there was no unusual odor when he arrived on the scene.

Key West Naval Station has blimps. It is possible the Station at Jacksonville may have one but we could not get a positive answer on that.

We received the naelotte in this afternoon's mail. We will see that it is returned to him. If we can find out the answers to any more questions for you, don't hesitate to call on us.

[Signature of Y-Captain Carney]

West Palm Beach, Florida

Dear Captain Carney:

We have tested _______ knife for radiation with negative results and are sending it to you under separate cover. Please return it and thank him for the use.

The Aero-Medical Laboratory here at Wright Field examined the hat which was recently submitted that is causing a temperature of between 200 and 300°? to search cotton. They state, however, that it is possible that a man's skin will not suffer burns if the heat lasts for a few seconds only. We have sent it on to Washington for further analysis.

We will keep you informed of things as they develop and would appreciate your doing the same. Thanks very much again for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

Memorandum for Record

Subject: Examination of the Machete Carried by Mr. [redacted] for the Possibility of it Being Radioactive.

1. On the morning of 25 Aug 52, Lt R. H. Olsson took the machete which Mr. [redacted] was carrying at the time he supposedly contacted an unidentified serial object to Equipment Lab to have it checked for radiation. It was thoroughly checked by members of the Equipment Lab with a geiger counter and it was determined that it was in no way radioactive.

Subject: Analysis of [redacted] Hat

On the morning of 25 Aug 52, Lt R. H. Olsson contacted Major R. Harlan in the Clothing Research Division of the Medical Unit of Aero Med Lab. Purpose of the visit was to show Maj Harlan the hat that had been worn by Mr. [redacted] and to determine some facts about the burned spots. Maj Harlan examined the hat and determined that the three spots that were believed to be burns were burns, and that the part of the hat that appeared to be scorched was actually scorched. He stated that it would be possible for the hat to be scorched, but not burn the skin of the wearer since cotton burns at between 300 and 500°F, at which time it starts to disintegrate and carbonize. From the scorching on the hat, it appeared that the hat was present for only a short time. Maj Harlan believed that due to that short period of time, the skin could escape without suffering burns.

Publicity Agent Will "Protect" Man After "Saucer" Incident

By United Press

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Aug. 24—A scoutmaster who said he was about to fly a "flying saucer" trend up with a publicity agent today to "protect" him from inquisitive reporters and the Air Force.

J. D. (Sonny) Desvergers emerged from an overnight hideaway long enough to announce he has made a "gentlemen's agreement" with Publicity Agent Art Weil that any further details on his experience will be reserved for "certain magazines."

Presumably, the announcement means Desvergers will not submit to further questioning by the Air Force. The Air Force in Washington said it had only an "unofficial report" on Desvergers' experience and did not have enough information to draw a conclusion.

But the Air Force said it thought the incident is "explainable."

The Air Force has no legal hold on Desvergers, but they talk to him like a Dutch uncle, publicity men well declared. "This interests need to be protected."

While he is being "protected," Desvergers vowed to "keep my head down."

"I'm not even looking up in the sky anymore," he said.

Desvergers, a former Marine, said the hair on his arm was singed off and three holes about one-eighth of an inch in diameter were burned in his scout cap last week while on an outing in the Everglades with three Boy Scouts.

Desvergers said he saw flashing lights of what he believed at first to be a crashing airliner. He dashed through the brush with a machete and flashlight, leaving the scene in the car to call for help.

"I'm not back in 10 minutes," he said, "he found a mushroom-shaped object large enough for six men to stand up in.

"It was about 10 feet high in diameter and shaped like a big ball, tapering down to a three-foot thickness on the side.

There was a phosphorous effect around the side.

"I heard the hinges open and they shot at me," he said.

"Seemed Like 10 Years"

"I believe I was under and near what seemed like 10 years. It was only 10 feet from the ground and made a hissing sound like a fire going down."

He said those in the saucer shot fire at him through that seemed like a boat slowly at my face" and he was blacked out.

Deputy Sheriff Mott Partin arrested the scene as Desvergers dashed out of the brush. The deputy said the southeastern "looked like a wild man."

Desvergers said the Army has examined and pre-examined him both mentally and physically "and they gave me a top bill of health."

(An officer from Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force base was sent to Florida to check on the incident.

Results of his investigation can be released only from Washington, however, a WPAEB spokesman stated last night.)

JOURNAL HERALD, DAYTON, OHIO, MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 1952

Here is the text from the document:

Ex-Marine Describes 'Saucer Attack'

WEST PALM BEACH (IP) — A strange experience with what he first man ever attacked by a flying saucer was told here today by a man who believes about it "because I saw it."

Said D. R. Desvergers, 30-year-old hardware salesman and former Marine, indicated he was confronted by a strange object housed in a vast "area of trees" at night. "I was of them."

And this, he says, was why he was directly under the object when he came upon it in the woods at night.

Desvergers went further into his remarkable experience with a reporter from the Palm Beach Post, after he was questioned for several hours Friday night by "higher-ranking officers from Washington."

He indicated he and the officers were substantially in agreement on what the object was.

He left the boys in the car with instructions to go for help if he failed to return promptly. Then he started into the woods.

As he pushed through the brush, he said, he first became aware of an "and I became aware that all was not right."

"Then I heard the hissing sound."

As I moved, it got louder. I flashed my light up and I was right under it."

"Ugh," he explained, was a flying saucer about 30 feet in diameter hovering about 10 feet above the earth. It was "hemispherical in shape" and "large enough for six or eight men" to stand up in it. It had windows "like an airliner."

Desvergers said the object then proclaimed the flash or ball of fire at him and he was overcome, as sailed not only by light and heat, but also by an overpowering stench.

"When I awakened out of the trance," he said, "I realized, and since then he has suffered 'a tingling sensation like when your foot loses circulation and goes to sleep.'"

"I walked around, but couldn't feel the ground, it was like walking on air."

"But the deputy sheriff who arrived there later couldn't find my footprints in the rain-fresh dirt between where I discovered my lamp and where I left unconscious, and where a number of yards."
