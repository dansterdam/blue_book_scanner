c. East
d. Southeast
e. South
f. Southwest
g. West
h. Northwest

31. If you are familiar with bearing terms (angular direction), try to estimate the number of degrees the object was
from true North and also the number of degrees it was upward from the horizon (elevation).

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place "A" on the curved line to show where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it, and "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

This image appears to be a topographical map of a region, likely in Maine. The map shows various geographical features such as terrain contours, roads, and possibly town or county boundaries. Some text is visible, but much of it is difficult to read clearly due to the image quality. The map seems to be black and white and has a vintage, historical appearance typical of mid-20th century cartographic documents. At the bottom of the map, there are some text lines that appear to be publication or map details, but the text is too blurry to transcribe accurately.

This image appears to be a topographical map of an area in Maine, showing various geographical features such as mountains, brooks, and ponds. Some of the notable locations on the map include:

- Four Ponds Mtn
- Spruce Mtn
- Summit
- Brimstone Mountain
- Old Blue Mtn

The map shows contour lines, elevation markers, and some boundary lines. At the bottom of the map, there is a small text block that appears to be a citation or map attribution, but the text is too small and blurry to read clearly in this image.

The map seems to cover a region with multiple mountains, brooks, and varying terrain, with elevations marked at different points.
