Mins for Cold File

1. Origin recently filed - 
   Sighted with a plastic body.

2. The plastic model, first 
   of its kind, is reported well 
   from a balloon.

3. It is not known whether the 
   balloon is "free" or "anchored". 
   However, as these are presumably 
   first findings, it is believed 
   the balloon may have been 
   anchored - and have stationary.

4. Report states the purpose to 
   these works is upper atmosphere 
   research.

when they sighted a total of 12 unusual lights south of them. These lights were
sighted on three separate occasions in groups of 3, 3, and 4. Planes were described
as being yellow to yellow-orange in color, between the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock and
a bushel basket. Flashes were of approximately 3 seconds duration, and sharply
defined. Flashes were stationary as opposed to moving like a rocket.

2. Chronology:
----- Sighted five unusual flashes at intervals of from 5 to 3 seconds.
Appeared to be on or near surface. Upper, two-thirds of a circle visible.
A/C (T-33) at 30,000 ft. heading 130° in vicinity of Zama AB. Visibility
unlimited in thin cloud layer at 10,000 ft. Flat on top. Maj. Carr at
controls, Maj. Carr IP.
1330: A/C directly over Zama AB heading 330° Maj Carr at controls 3
identical flashes sighted in same position. Range estimated at at least
50 miles possibly much farther.

of 270° Maj. Carr at controls. Four additional flashes observed. Maj. Carr
turned nose of A/C directly toward flashes. New heading 200°. Flashes
