The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, with handwritten text and no visible photograph. Based on the image, I will produce the text found in the document:

1. Name in English
2. Seen recently had a plastic body.
3. The plastic coated point of its tail is estimated to be from a balloon.
4. It is not known whether the balloon is "gas" or "material". However, as there is generally no reason to doubt the observer, it is believed that the balloon may have been mistaken - and have a strange formation.
4. Report states the purpose of these reports is open-ended research.
