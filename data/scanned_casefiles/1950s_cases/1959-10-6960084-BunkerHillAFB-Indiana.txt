K. INVESTIGATING OFFICER: OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 305TH
BOMBARDMENT WING (M) (SAC), LT HARRY A KERSEY JR. BASED ON AN
ANALYSIS OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE UFO
WAS PROBABLY A STAR OR THE PLANET VENUS. THE OBSERVERS WHO SIGHTED
THE LIGHT SOURCE ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT IT LOOKED LIKE
A STAR. EXPERIENCED WEATHER MEN WHO WERE OBSERVERS ARE SURE THAT
IT WAS A STAR WHICH THEY SIGHTED BEFORE ONLY MAGNIFIED BY AN
ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION. THE PILOTS WHO OBSERVED THE OBJECT FROM
40,000 FEET CONCURRED THAT THEY BELIEVED IT TO BE A STAR.

COMPUTATIONS SHOW THAT VENUS WAS ON A BEARING OF 102 DEGREES AT AN
ANGLE OF 23 DEGREES AND 20 MINUTES AT 08/1040Z WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY
THE SAME LOCATION AS THAT FOUND IN PARAGRAPH B2 ON WHICH THE OBSERVERS
AGREE. THE BASE ISO DID NOT RECEIVE ANY CALLS ON THIS SIGHTING.

WHILE ALL OBSERVERS WERE IN CLOSE AGREEMENT ON THIS SIGHTING,
ONE OF THEM ALSO SIGHTED AN IRREGULAR FORMATION OF 9 PIN POINTS OF
LIGHT TRAVERSING NORTH WEST TO SOUTH EAST ON APPROXIMATE HEADING OF
135 DEGREES. THESE LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES
AS THEY TRAVELED AT HIGH SPEED ACROSS THE HORIZON AND DISAPPEARED
FROM VIEW. THERE WERE NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN THE VICINITY OF THE BASE
AT THIS TIME. NO OTHER OBSERVER MADE A SIGHTING OF THIS TYPE, THE
OBSERVER WHO GAVE THIS ACCOUNT IS VERY RELIABLE ONE BUT DUE TO
THE LACK ON CORROBORATING EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THIS SIGHTING WE ARE
DISCOUNTING ITS VALIDITY.
