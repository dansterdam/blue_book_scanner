At approximately 0130 hours, 6 September 1952, T/Sgt stated he sighted a bright, white object. This object was brighter than a star and moved around in a circle from a definite area. It appeared to rise and descend at irregular intervals and length. The object would move very fast to the left or right of the original position and then return to the same area.
The same or a similar object was observed by A/2C -------- and A/2C ---------- Both Airmen confirmed the sightings and the statements.
