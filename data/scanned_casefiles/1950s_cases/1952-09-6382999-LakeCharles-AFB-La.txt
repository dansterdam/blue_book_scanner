Lt Col Theodore I. Pascoe, 3363A
Personal Interview with Observers
19 Dec 1951

SUMMARY: (Texts) Concise summary of report, date, source, etc.

At approximately 0130 hours, 6 September 1952, T/Sgt and sighted an object like a bright star. The object was round in form and brighter than a star and moved around in a circle from a definite area. It appeared to rise and drop, it set still for an unknown length of time and then would move very fast to the left or to the right not always in a straight line.

On the same night and at the same time the object was observed by A/1C and A/2C statement. Both Airmen confirmed statement.

At approximately 0230 hours, 7 September 1952, T/Sgt again sighted the same object, like approximately the same area. It appeared to move faster and cover a larger area than it did on 6 September 1952.

Here is the text I can read from the image:

(468) GALVESTON BAY

Top right corner: ELE

Left side vertical text: FJ

Bottom left corner: FJ

Other readable text includes various city and town names such as:
- Jacksonville
- Tyler
- Bullard
- Palestine
- Elkhart
- Centerville
- Crockett
- Grapeland
- Huntsville
- Pineland
- Montgomery
- Conroe

The image appears to be a road map or sectional chart showing various highways, roads, and towns in what seems to be an area of Texas, with grid coordinates and markings.


- page 4 -

This appears to be a World Aeronautical chart showing a map of a region, likely in Louisiana and Texas. The title is partially cut off, starting with "WORLD AERONA-". The map shows various cities, towns, and flight paths or routes, with elevation markings in feet along the top and side margins. Some visible cities include Henderson, Carthage, Mount Enterprise, Nacogdoches, Beaumont, and Lake Charles. The map is in black and white and appears to be an older, vintage aeronautical navigation chart.

Text from the image:

NAUTICAL CHART

Compiled to ICAO Standards
For ICAO number add 2000 to the chart number.

(Joins 408)

The image contains a detailed navigational chart showing various regions, including parts of Louisiana, with numerous cities, towns, and navigation routes marked. The chart includes grid references, city names, and appears to be a mid-20th century aeronautical navigation map.

Some visible regions/abbreviations include:
NC, NB, NA, PC, PB, NAV, etc.

Some cities/towns visible:
Alexandria, Lake Charles, Jennings, Crowley, Lafayette, Winnsboro, Natchez, and many others.


- page 6 -

The image is a map with the following text:

Lambert Conformal Conic Projection
Standard Parallels 33° and 45° Scale 1:1,000,000

(468)

The map shows various cities and towns in what appears to be Louisiana and Mississippi, with grid references and elevation markings. Some notable locations include:

- New Orleans
- Baton Rouge
- Brookhaven
- Columbia
- Natchez
- Vicksburg
- Crystal Springs
- Picayune
- Hammond
- Bogalusa

The map includes grid references like QC, QA, AB, AC, GJ, and others. There are also notations for radio stations and parishes.

The map is marked with page number (468) and appears to be from a geographical or navigational document.
