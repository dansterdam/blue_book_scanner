STATEMENT

14 November 1957

At approximately 0355 hours, 19 November 57, Captain Deans, Operations Officer, Provost Marshall's Office, Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, notified me telephonically that the Chief of Police in Maryland had seen an unidentified flying object, which had disintegrated leaving a few remnants. Captain Deans mentioned that he was sending a Military Police car to Captain Dean, and asked if we desired to send anyone along. I checked with Major Sapors, Post 525, who directed me to go with the Military Police. Captain Dean asked me to wait at Post Headquarters for the Military Police car, which was then dispatched immediately. SFC Freeman, Military Police Operations, and I proceeded to State Hospital, Maryland.

Upon arrival at the State Hospital, at approximately 1030 hours, SFC Freeman and I entered the Administration Building, where we contacted Mr. [illegible], Chief of Police, State Hospital, [illegible], Maryland, who had seen the unidentified flying object. He introduced SFC Freeman and me to the hospital garage, where he introduced us to Mr. [illegible], State Hospital, Maryland, a second eyewitness.

[illegible] and [illegible] stated that shortly before 0500 hours, 19 November 1957, they heard a popping noise, and saw an object at between 500 and 2000 feet. They thought the object was a parachute at first, and watched it disintegrating for between 5 to 10 minutes. The object appeared to be disintegrating on the way down; however, no pieces broke off. The object reached the ground near the garage at State Hospital, at approximately 0700 hours. At that time, the object was about the size of a cigarette paper.

Mr. [illegible] attempted to pick up pieces of the object with his fingers, but the pieces disintegrated immediately. Mr. [illegible] salvaged a few pieces by lifting them on a piece of paper, and placed them on a desk in the garage.

SFC Freeman and I picked up the remnants on a piece of paper and placed them in a paper old box. We returned to the Provost Marshall's Office where we informed Captain Dean concerning the incident. SFC Freeman then left me at Post Headquarters, where I showed Major Sapors the box and gave him a brief detailed of the incident. Major Sapors showed the remnants to Colonel Naugh, Deputy Post Commander.

Approximately 1520 hours, upon receiving instructions from Captain Barrington, this undersigned with M/Sgt Slates assistance, made arrangements for the CID Provost, Tng & EM 308 Tng, the CIC, and the Military Police to proceed to the Maryland General Hospital, Maryland, to ascertain whether or not there might be any unexploded objects or radiological activity in the area.

At approximately 1710 hours, upon arrival at the hospital, contact was made with the group to the area where the unknown object was supposed to have landed.

Post Chemical and ECD Team checked the area thoroughly and not with negative results. ECD Team was informed of these results at that time.

After talking with the hospital, it was determined that two employees Mr. [redacted] and a Mr. [redacted], who was working in the area on a tractor was also present at that time. Identification of this individual would be possible to obtain.

The following information was obtained from [redacted] at this time:

1. Object was first sighted at approximately 0900 hours by Chief of Police, [redacted] State Mental Hospital and Mr. [redacted], employee of [redacted] State Mental Hospital.

2. Object was first noticed at about 1500 to 2000 feet and looked like a saucer about three feet in diameter attached to a parachute. As the object continued to drop it seemed to get smaller and smaller, and when it reached the ground, there was nothing left but a piece of paper the size of a cigarette paper which continued to dissolve. Stated that by the time Sgt Slates from Post 32 office, had arrived at approximately 1030 hours, there were only small pieces remaining of the size of nail heads, of which Sgt Slates returned one piece to Fort Meade.

3. Persons who had sighted the UFO, and further stated that they were always trustworthy.

At approximately 1800 hours the undersigned contacted Captain Barrington from the hospital and informed him of the results. Captain Barrington informed me to let [redacted] know that any press releases were his responsibility, which I did at that time.
