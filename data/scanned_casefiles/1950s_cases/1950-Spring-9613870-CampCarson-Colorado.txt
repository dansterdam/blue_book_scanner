Director of Information
WAIFC (AFOIN-1)
Randolph A. F. Base, Texas 78148

Dear Sir:

I have read your 15 May, 1966 Air Force policy letter for commanders.

Your statements on UFO sightings and Air Force conclusions are strongly contested by the undersigned. If the Air Force can so readily explain the sightings, why has not someone attempted to explain to me my official sighting in 1950?

I respectfully request some of the Air Force experts explain to me the so-called hallucinations I experienced, and until it has been fully explained I will continue to make it a matter of public record and in direct opposition to the Air Force stated conclusion and policy.

If the Air Force is using this for a cover for classified work please let me know and I will act accordingly.

Most sincerely,

Col. USAF (Ret)

HEADQUARTERS FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION (AFSC)
Attention: TDETR/UFO
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433

Dear Sirs:

Enclosed is the FTD form 164 which is completed except for the exact dates. If you do not have access to the dates of the First Survival School at Camp Carson in the Spring of 1950 and it is important, I will write for a copy of my records and forward you the exact date.

I wrote the letter on this matter because officially the Air Force has been calling me a liar or otherwise for several years while holding a top secret clearance and having access to a lot of highly classified material. I know what I saw, and I reported it through proper channels. However if there is a reason for me to shut up on it, I will. Otherwise it will be treated as unclassified.

Sincerely yours,

Col. USAF (Ret.)

Proposed reply to letter [redacted], Col, USAF (Ret) 2 Nov 66

Dear Colonel [redacted]

This is in reply to your recent letter of 2 November 1966 addressed to the Foreign Technology Division. We once again made a check of all 1950 files and could not locate your sighting. It is quite possible that your sighting did not reach the Project Blue Book office at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. If your sighting was evaluated at base level it would not have been forwarded to Wright-Patterson.

The analysts at Wright-Patterson will study the information which you provided in your letter of 2 November. You must remember, however, that at this late date it is impossible to check many aspects of your sighting. Also, it is impossible to duplicate the same atmospheric and relative conditions that were present the day on which you made your observation. Therefore, you can see that it will take some time before we can arrive at a conclusion as to what you observed in 1950. You will be notified as to what the final evaluation will be.

We do not understand the last paragraph of your letter in which you state that the "Air Force has been calling me a liar or otherwise of several years." Does this have anything to do with your sighting? If so, you do not explain it thoroughly. We regret your feelings towards the Air Force and hope that better relations can be established.
