Bakers-rille, N. C.
April 1, 1958

Dear Sirs:
I would like to report if I saw the guidance of a display.
It looked much like a brilliantly lit globe and seemed to maneuver for Bakersville too. She time was about 9:30 P.M. Saturday nite 3/29/58.
This was directly in the sky heading from north to south. It had a very strange configuration and motion not like any thing I had seen before.
It was slow and seemed to be hovering in the direct line of my sighting for a while. Then it took off in a straight line again heading south.
Several residents also saw this same object and time. It was small but looked much larger than any of the stars in the sky.
I would appreciate your forwarding to me any information on this sighting that you may have as I am very interested in it.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
