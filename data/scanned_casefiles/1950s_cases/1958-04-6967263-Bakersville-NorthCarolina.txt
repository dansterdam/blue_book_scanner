Bakersville, N.C.
Route #1, Box
April 15, 1958

Mr. McElroy
Secretary of Defense
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

I do not know if I saw the satellite falling. I do not know its location for the party of the county. I am sending the information that I do see it was one mile south of Bakersville facing east.

The time was about 5:20 P.M. entering on 4-15-58.

There was something in the sky heading from north to south. It looked like a shooting star. It was a very clear night. The object that met falling a straight line, that more like that of one big to the earth. It stopped part of the coast turning into the earth. It seemed to slow down at the end. It was a kind of resting low in color. It thought that if then date correspond to the exact time and location that the Defense Department might like to file it. I still am spare you to file it with me. I will write south that I did not see it was not right.
