Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the southwestern sky these evening as darkness falls is again a bright star - or some bright light hung in the sky's part of an experiment.

It is Venus, reaching its greatest prominence, which comes just before in disappear from the evening sky early in 1958.

Venus is far brighter than any other star or planet now in the night sky and there is no difficulty in identifying it. Indeed, it can be observed long before the sky is dark. In fact, if you know where to look, you can even see it in broad daylight!

After it passed behind the sun last April 14, Venus has gradually been drawing to the east of that body. That means that it has followed the sun in its daily motion across the sky, and so remained visible in the west after the sun had set. On Nov. 18 it will be farther east of the sun, hence remaining in the sky for the longest time after sunset, nearly three hours. After that it will start moving toward the sun again.

Because of its early setting, Venus does not appear on the accompanying maps of the November evening skies, which show their appearance about 10:30 p.m., your own kind of standard time, at the first of November, 9:00 p.m. on the 15th and 8:00 p.m. on the 30th.

Bright Birds in the Sky

These maps do, however, show the stars that are now visible. Toward the west is Deneb, at the top of the "northern cross," which is really part of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. Deneb is in the bird's tail; in fact, the word is Arabic and means "tail." The crosspiece represents the wings, and the lower part of the cross his lost, stretched forward in flight. At the head is Albireo, a star of the second magnitude on the astronomical brightness scale. Below Cygnus is another first-magnitude star, Vega, in Lyra, the harp.

To the left is another bird, Aquila, the eagle, with the star Altair.

High in the south you can see the four stars that form the "great square" part of the constellation of Pegasus, the winged horse. Although there are not among the brightest, their characteristic arrangement makes them a good starting place from which to find other groups. This because, while unique, it helps locate them in the sky, much as a row of stars extending westward from the lower right corner of the square is like a lead to other groups.

The star at the upper right of Pegasus is Alpheratz, a star of the first magnitude. Just above Orion is Taurus, the bull, with brilliant Aldebaran, and to the left of this figure stands Auriga, the charioteer, with first magnitude Capella.

Although only Venus is now visible in the evening, two other planets appear in the southeast before sunrise. Brightest of these is Jupiter, in the constellation of Virgo, the Virgin. It is close to the bright star Spica.

However, it exceeds the star in brilliance about ten times.

Father east in Mars, rising about an hour and a half before the sun, between the half that of Spica. Mercury and Saturn are both too near the sun to easily visible in November.

Shower of "Stars" to Come

November is the month bringing one of the year's famous showers of meteors, or "shooting stars," which appear from about the 13th to the 16th.

They are most numerous after midnight, because then we are on the forward side of the earth in its annual movement around the sun. Thus, we meet them headon. This is different from the evening hours when we are on the rearward part, and see only those that catch up to us.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                                                20 Nov 57
                                                                                    Dansville, Indiana

The following is in answer to your
request in one of the recent items
of FLYING SAUCERS from Other
Worlds that UFO Information be
sent to you and that you would act
as a central clearing house for such
information.

First of all, I would appreciate a
brief mention in the next issue I
I am not too late with this letter
to the truth behind the secret of the
saucers. I'm in a non-profit or-
ganization dedicated, as are nearly
all the other research organizations,
to the truth behind the secret of the
saucers. I'm in a non-profit re-
search to one specific field, but are
open to any and all suggestions, for
even the most ridiculous theory may
be correct.

Now, on with the info - First I'd
like to report an odd experience
which my wife and I had. It was not
our first time to see something odd
in the sky, but this sighting took the
cake. In actuality, it was two sepa-
rate sightings within minutes of each
other. Both sightings occurred on
20 November 1957, The first one was
at 5:27 p.m. (CST) near the Allison
Engine Plant in Indianapolis at
west Michigan Street. My wife and
I were driving home from work
when a red-orange light appeared
about 70 degrees above the horizon
in the south-southwest. Venus was
immediately located and was Object
was about 10 degrees west and about
3 degrees below the planet. The

was clear but a few scattered clouds
appeared in patches in the dark-
ness. The object was moving north
when first sighted and as it con-
tinued to move in a straight line,
the light gradually faded. After a
total 3 seconds, it flashed violently
back on, remained bright for a few
seconds, then once again faded slow-
ly. This happened about 15 seconds
apart, and a total of four times. We
stopped the car and got out. The
object was still visible. It disappear-
ed behind a cloud, but was in sight
from 5:27 to 5:31 (CST), a total of
four minutes. I would judge that the
object was 5 to 6:00 feet in the air
the entire period of time it was in
sight.

Later that same night, as we were
between Avon and Danville, Indiana
and about 15 miles from Indianapolis, at 9:05 p.m. (CST) we were
driving on Highway 36 when we
saw two bright lights of an object
about 550 feet high. The lights on the
left was green, and the one on the
right was red. The lights seemed to
be hovering. As we watched, the ob-
ject in a slanted following the highway to Terre Haute Airport in Indianapolis, but when we came near-
er to the lights, they seemed to
move up. I stopped the car when
the lights were almost over us and
when we got out the car and looked
up, the object seemed to have no
directly shown lights, no form or
shape. There
was no sound. When the object was
out the color side of us we saw a
white while light moving somewhat
slowly than retaining a very
high rate of speed as it approached.
Avon. Meriden appears on the red
light. When visible after hovering
passed in three was never any
sound, in fact the car engine did
not even miss.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

a sharp turn toward the south, then back north and resumed its previous course. The object was in sight for a total of 15 minutes, as we know it was going fairly slow.

On 5 November 1957 at 10:10 p.m. (CST) 5 persons were returning to their homes from a ball game. The coach, Mr. Martin Wiesener, and his wife were turning in the driveway of their home in New Lisbon, Indiana when the car behind them stopped and Mrs. Leota Barlow, also of New Lisbon called three bright white lights in the sky to their attention.

Also in the Barlow car were Mrs. Barlow's son and daughter, Dave and Sylvia Barlow. All five persons saw the objects clearly.

They were described by Mr. Wiesener in a report to the UFO Research Bureau as "moving, extremely slow" and changing brightness from time to time. The objects were the size of basketballs held at arm's length and were moving from south to east. Of the three objects, two were white and the third was red with white rotating lights. Mr. Wiesener reports, "It appeared as though the three objects were connected."

A telephone call to Mrs. Polk proved interesting. She was able to 3 weeks later to see the same thing again but this time there were a rainbow before we saw the object.

When questioned further regarding this phenomenon, Mrs. Polk revealed that the "rainbow" appeared in the sky after darkness and that the ball of fire appeared later and seemed to traverse the entire length of the "rainbow".

I also have a sketch made by one of the boys involved in the Greencastle incident recently reported to you.
