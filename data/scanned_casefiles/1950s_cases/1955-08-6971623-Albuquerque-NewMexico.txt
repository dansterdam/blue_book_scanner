The image appears to contain an index card from Project Blue Book, a UFO investigation program. The card contains details about a UFO sighting that occurred on August 10, 1955 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

The text on the card is as follows:

DATE: 10 August 1955
LOCATION: Albuquerque, New Mexico
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
PHOTOS: No
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Approx 15 minutes
BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: One (1) round-disc-shaped object, silver, trailing smoke, traveled NW, remained stationary

CONCLUSIONS: Was Balloon, Probably Balloon, Possibly Balloon, Was Aircraft, Probably Aircraft, Possibly Aircraft, Was Astronomical, Probably Astronomical, Possibly Astronomical, Other (Insufficient Data to Evaluate).

The sighting is described as a single round, disc-shaped, silver object that trailed smoke as it traveled northwest and then remained stationary. The conclusions indicate that the object was likely a weather balloon, but other possibilities, such as an aircraft or astronomical phenomenon, could not be ruled out.
