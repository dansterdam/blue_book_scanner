AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FLIGHT 3-H, 4662D AISS
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the UFOB sighting reported by the observer was probably a midraneous or unusual type weather balloon. The apparent sise of the UFOB from the observer's description and memory sketch seems to indicate the possibility of a radiosonde. The directions and speed of the winds aloft seems to extend the possibility of a radiosonde to the general vicinity of Wayne, Pennsylvania on 3 October 1955. It is felt that the UFOB was not observed by any other observers suggests that it was an isolated incident, probably a friendly object.
COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER: Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by a radiosonde type weather balloon.

II. RELIABILITY: Good. SOURCE was contacted personally.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
SOURCE stated he was standing beside his car at the side of the road about 1/4 mile from an aircraft and the parachute was a streamer (did not inflate). He did not hear any engine noise. The object was circular with a luminous red dome on top and was hovering about 75 feet above the ground.

SOURCE was facing north, the object appeared to be approx 700 above the horizon. At an altitude of 700 feet and a distance of 1/4 mile the object SEEMED to be approximately the size of a 75 mm shell cap.

The object SUDDENLY accelerated vertically at a terrific speed and disappeared from view in 2 or 3 seconds. A small amount of glowing gas or vapour appeared near the base of the object.

SOURCE estimated the size of the UFOR to be as large as a 9" panel held at arm's length.

The first object was positioned north of the large object and moved slowly to the north until it disappeared from view after approximately 15 minutes. The second object also appeared to the west and moved to the west until it, too, faded from sight. This second object was observed for 6 or 7 minutes.

The day was clear with a slight surface wind.

SOURCE stated that "weather balloon equipment" had been located in the vicinity of the UFOR sighting in the past.
