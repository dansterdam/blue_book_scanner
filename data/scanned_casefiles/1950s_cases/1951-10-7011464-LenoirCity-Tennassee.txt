AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1. On 7 Oct 1951, a light was sighted in the North Atlantic Ocean that was described as being an unusual light that appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 25,000 feet. The object was observed to be traveling at a high rate of speed in a straight horizontal direction.
2. Dr. Fletcher estimated that the flash illuminated about 3/4 of the horizon for approximately 1-2 seconds. The flash was described as being a bluish-white color and the object was not seen. The object was not heard and no trail was visible.
3. Considerable speculation was aroused as to the nature of the flash and the possibility of an unusual type of aircraft having been responsible for the observed phenomenon, but no positive conclusion could be drawn.
4. The report concludes that the flash was probably a natural phenomenon, possibly associated with unusual atmospheric conditions.

Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir:
Recently I submitted to you a strange object sighted near here. As stated a strange object passed the immediate vicinity and from the direction and actions appeared to be of a metallic nature.
A round shaped craft was observed passing over us at a high rate of speed, as nearly as can be estimated from 3000 to 4000 feet in altitude. It made a sound like a normal aircraft, but the lack of propulsion method or wing formation was quite obvious. As it passed over again, there appeared to be a slight protrusion or small dome on the upper surface, and the speed and maneuverability were astounding.
I have seen ships of flight before, but this certainly was a strange occurrence.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
