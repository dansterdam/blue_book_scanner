AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: Sightings in North Atlantic Ocean

Date: 21 October 1951     Place: Intelligence Division, HQAACS
                            Andrews AFB, Washington 25, D.C.

By: G. G. Long, Captain, USAF

SUMMARY: (Use code summary of report. Use typewriter in black ribbon)

1. Dr. [redacted] a consultant to the Directorate of Scientific Services of the Weather Bureau, Washington, D.C., advised that while on a passenger or an American Airways Stratocruiser Flight 123 from Frankfurt to New York via Gander, Newfoundland on 21 October 1951, he observed a bright yellowish flash.

2. The flash was in the direction of approximately 450 feet, and at the time of observation was an altitude of 22,000 feet at the approximate location of 62° North, 15° West. The weather at the time was very clear.

3. Dr. Fletcher estimated that the flash illuminated about 30° of the horizon for an instant. At the time of observation, Dr. Fletcher was seated on the starboard side of the aircraft and by chance happened to be looking out the window in the direction of the flash. He did not hear of any of the other passengers having seen the flash.

Dear Sir:

I would like to report a strange object flying near here. It had a strange sound like a whirring motor not then like a machine gun.

A short time while smoke was shot from it.

It made a sound as if it had swirled them while it started again and moved west and then some off.

I was after I saw something strange then.

I have enclosed a sketch.

Yours Truly,
[Signature blacked out]

[The document also contains two hand-drawn sketches of what appears to be an object in the sky, with some landscape lines at the bottom of the page.]
