DETAILS:

1. This investigation is opened at the direction of the District Commander predicated upon information furnished this District by Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], who reported sighting an aerial phenomenon on 30 June 1952.

AT WILLIAMS AIR FORCE BASE, ARIZONA

2. On 1 July 1952, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] reported to the writer that they were driving on 35th Avenue (located #15) outside Phoenix, Arizona, at about 2100 hours, 30 June 1952, when they suddenly became aware of a light of unusual brilliance above the horizon and in an easterly direction from their position. Mr. [redacted] immediately stopped the car and they both got out to observe the light. Both described it as extremely round in shape, apparently very far away, and emitting a strange white light of unusual brilliance. Mr. [redacted] stated that he has done a great deal of welding and compared the light to that made by a welding torch. After getting out of the car they observed the light for a period of five (5) to eight (8) seconds. As they watched, the object traveled downward, arching slightly to the right, traveling very fast, and leaving no trail. It suddenly blinked out, then reappeared near the horizon, then traveled upward at an extremely high rate of speed. After two (2) or three (3) seconds, it suddenly flashed out again, then appeared about 450 above the horizon. Both Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] agreed that the object appeared to be at least several miles away and traveled much faster than any known aircraft. Mr. [redacted] stated it appeared to be as large as a full moon. His wife described it as being larger than a star, but some smaller than a full moon. Both stated they were startled and were not sure of the total length of time they observed the object, but believe they could actually see it for about thirty (30) seconds.

The owner and manager of the [redacted] Phoenix, Arizona, and he and Mrs. [redacted] are apparently of average intelligence. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] also stated that the object they sighted made no audible sounds.

3. No other reports coinciding with this sighting have been received by this District and this case is considered closed.
