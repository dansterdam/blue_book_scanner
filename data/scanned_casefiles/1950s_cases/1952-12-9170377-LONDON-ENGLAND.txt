London, England                                                12 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
An observer in London observed a watermelon-shaped object of white light estimated to be as high as 1,000 feet then disappearing behind some buildings. Object was slow moving and was sighted at 0300 for 3 minutes.

II. Discussion of Incident
This report is very brief. Nothing is known about the reliability of the observer, local air traffic, beacons on water towers, etc. Therefore, no real evaluation can be attempted although the description sounds like the landing light on an incoming plane.

III. Conclusion
Insufficient information.

[Partially obscured header information]

No. 1 am a mechanic.
No. How many years' service do you have?
A. Eight years and eight months.
A. What has been your particular job since you have been in service?
A. That of frame mechanic.

The following is a statement made by [obscured] concerning the incident:

[Partially obscured text about approximately 0900 hours on the morning of the 12th Dec]

[Signature section partially obscured]

Statement by S/Sgt Dahlberg:
After investigating the two airmen who reported the unidentified objects, I interviewed the 5th [partially obscured] aircraft crew. While aircraft were airborne between the hours of 2227, 11 December 1952 and 0012, 12 December 1952, no unusual occurrences were noted.

I would regard this report as being a fairly reliable witness or observer. I could give this report a C-2 rating. I do not regard the report as being as reliable as the one received by Airmen [obscured] but I would also advise that this report is given a C-3 rating.

[Signature section]

I have conferred with Capt Washington during all phases of this investigation and concur with his judgment as to the reliability of the observers.

[Signature of Joseph G. Johnson, Major]
