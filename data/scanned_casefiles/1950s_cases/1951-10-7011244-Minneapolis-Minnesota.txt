Minneaolis, Minn. - 12 October 1951

The only information available on this incident is a letter quoted below.

"WRE: 082, 11 Oct 51. Sighted a flying disk at 16,000 ft. observing the radar screen. At 1645 we were at 16,000 ft. S.E. of N.E. Airport. at that time we were a/c 1116 north of Minneapolis. I was flying at 250 kts. Following observation:

"The object was moving from east to west at 16,000 feet and very high. We tried keeping the side on a constant course but this maneuver was not possible. The object was similar in size to our aircraft and started to climb at about 50 degrees per second.

"This object was peculiar in that it had what is described as a halo around it, with a dark atmosphere. It moved rapidly and then slowed down and started to climb in lazy circles slowly. The pattern is now like a falling oak leaf movement. It was clearly visible for a few minutes and then with a very rapid acceleration disappeared to the east. This object, like and I watched, flew northwest.

"I don't know how to describe its size, because at the time I didn't have the balloon in sight for a comparison.

"Shortly after this we saw another one, but this one didn't hang around. It approached from the west and disappeared to the east, neither one leaving any trace of vapor trail.

"Then I saw the second one I called our tracking station at the U. S. Airport and the observers there on the theodolite range to get "glimpse of a number of them, but couldn't keep the theodolite long enough to keep them in the field of their instruments. Both Doug Smith and Jack Jordan caught glimpse of these objects in the theodolite turn I made. When of their presence by radio."

Status of Investigation

Further details of the incident have been requested. The sources have been investigated and are known to be experimental high altitude balloon observers with General Mills balloon project.

MINNEAPOLIS, MINN. - 11 October 1951

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

The only information available on this incident is a letter quoted below:

TIME: 0630, 11 Oct 51. _______ and I were flying at 10,000 ft. ob-
serving the 9th Air Balloon when I saw a brightly glowing object to the __
University of Minnesota Airport, As that time we were a few miles north of
Minneapolis and he ship east. I pointed it out to Jack and we both made the
following observation:

"The object was moving from east to west at a high rate and very bri__
lic. It tried woe-ing; the ship on a constant curve and this point being marker of
the windshield; as a point. The object moved past this marker at about 56 knots
per second.

This object was peculiar in that it had what can be described as a halo
around it with a dark undersurf ace. It crossed rapidly and then slowed down
and started to climb in lazy circles slowly. The pattern it made was like a
falling- one long lazy-bird. It went through the curtain for a complete two
and then with a very rapid acceleration disappeared to the east. This object,
- Dick- and I watched for approximately five minutes.

"I don't know how to describe its size, because at the time I didn't have
the balloon in sight for a comparison.

"Shortly after this we saw another one, but this one didn't hang around,
it approached from the west and disappeared to the east, neither one leaving
any trace of vapor trail.

"When I saw the second one I called our tracking station at the U. of __
Airport and the observers there on the theodolite managed to get glimpses of
a number of them, but couldn't keep the theodolite point fast enough to keep them
in the field of their instrument. Both Long Smith and Jack Jordan caught glimpses
of these objects in the theodolite after I notified them of their presence by
radio."

II. WEATHER:

Unknown, but evidently clear.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION:

Further investigation produced no additional information as to the identity
of the object. The theodolite operator was interrogated and stated that he could only
observe a brief blur for about two seconds. During his brief observation, the ob-
ject appeared to be a slowly prey circle shaped object. It left no vapor trail and
gave off no reflection.

All observers were positive of the following facts:

UNCLASSIFIED
CONFIDENTIAL

A. The object, though vaguely defined and blurred, retained a definite shape.

B. No vapor trail, exhaust flicker, or jet propulsion were observed.

C. The object definitely seemed to be controlled. The sources are all experienced observers with Gen-"11 "1919 balloon projects and have been observing all types of balloons for several years.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

No conclusions can be made. It is significant however, that the sources can be rated as very reliable and that they observed an object with which they were entirely unfamiliar.

12 October 1951

Flying Saucer Observation

Title: 10 October 1951
Place: 30-40 miles SE of St. Cloud Falls, Wisconsin
Observer: [redacted]

We had just started our trajectory flight and were proceeding from the north at an altitude of 4,000 ft. We sighted a club towards the balloon on a course of 220°. At 50° to W. I noticed a dim, glowing object, somewhat similar to last time to left, a great deal lighter as before my balloon. I estimated its own balloon was at approximately 2,000 ft. at the time.

Using our balloon for comparison, this object appeared to be short, the size of the balloon, more cylindrical, and shot 1 miles from the balloon. The object had a roughly gray (L) gray, crossing both sides of bow. Our balloon from last to west very rapidly, first coming in at a slight dive, leveling off for about a minute and slowing down, then into a 90 degree turn, climbing at an angle of 50 to 60° into the S.E. with a terrific acceleration, and disappeared.

[redacted] and I observed this object for a proximately two minutes and it crossed a rough terrain of approximately 10-50°, or 10 to 11 miles from west to east. I know that this object was not a balloon, jet, conventional, or celestial else.

Confirmation of the above sighting is not possible as [redacted] is presently at Minneapolis, Minn. on a special project for General Mills.

Sighting of Flying Saucers (contd.)

that time was a few miles north of Minneapolis and he noting west. I
pointed it out to Jack and we both made the following observation:

The object was moving from the east to west at a 15 h rate of speed
and at very high altitude. We tried hard to determine its constant
course to use the monitoring method of the viewmobile as a fixed
point. The object moved at an average speed of about 20 or more.

This object was peculiar in that it had what can be described as a halo
from its width a dark undersurface. It crossed rapidly and then
slowed down and started to climb slowly in lazy circles. The pattern
it made was like an inverted elliptic left. It was very large,
gyrations for a couple of minutes. This object, when watched
for approximately five minutes. I could not determine whether at the
of 15 Air port and the objects were on the geodetic compass to get
its speed or a number of them, but couldn't keep the theodolite focus.
Fast enough to keep them in the field of their instruments. Follow-
ing our observation, they left the geodetic compass in the theodolite
after I notified them of their presence by radio.

I don't know how to describe its size, because at the time I didn't have
the balloon size, but too considerable and the weather was calm.

Shortly after this we saw another one, about two hours later, but this
one didn't hang around. It approached from the west and disappeared
to the east, neither one leaving any trace of vapor trail.

Cpt. G.F. Haglund

The second of the observations reported above was confirmed by [redacted] who was
one of the crew at the U. of F. airport tracking; the balloon ascension. The object
crossed his area. Field or vision on a path roughly from A to 10 o'clock and when
Mr. Dorian tried to track it in the theodolite he not only a brief blue (believes
it was because the theodolite wasn't focused). The object was visible in the theodolite
for a little under two seconds and appeared to be smoky gray (no solo or glow was
noticeable), clear or hazy. Left no vapor trail and gave off no reflection such as an
reflected by metal. [redacted] not present at time of interrogation so this is
hearsay reported by [redacted]. [redacted] with Mr. Dorian in all accounts on this above
information. Both [redacted] and [redacted] claim that during their period of visual
observation they saw two more like objects which finally passed in transit, between
after the first and all departed at same time. The men in the plane saw only the
one object described above.

All of these men were very positive on the following major points:

1. Object though vaguely defined and blurred by distance retained a
definite shape.

2. No vapor trails, exhaust flashes or jet propulsion flames were seen.
