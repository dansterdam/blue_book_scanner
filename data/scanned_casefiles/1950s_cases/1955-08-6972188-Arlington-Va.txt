II. RELIABILITY: Good

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On the night of 3 Jul 55, 10:45 PM, EDT, my friend (Rev. - Deleted) and I were standing near the south side of my house, facing to the south. Suddenly a light appeared traveling from the east to the west. At first it appeared to be a bright star but it soon exceeded the brightness of any star I have ever seen. It traveled in a straight line and disappeared in about ten seconds. It turned east and disappeared in about ten seconds more. The whole observation lasted about fifteen seconds. It turned east and disappeared again. Subsequently we saw it again. This time again it appeared in the east and disappeared in the west. This course the other did not repeat. The other object seemed to be moving much slower and had a steady light. When it did so it continued on its regular course. While it was standing still, it looked like one of the stars. When the motion started, the light seemed to increase. Above it was a 'saucer-shaped' object; since they didn't appear to lose latitude as they moved along as objects ordinarily do, I think it was due to reflection from the sun.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE had been observing stars through his friend's telescope when he noticed a light in the sky which he at first thought to be a star. However, this light appeared to be moving at such a speed that he observed the motion to be definite. As the light continued to move, two other similar lights appeared in the sky, each appearing to be moving in a different direction from the other two.
The objects seemed to be pulsating in a bright orange color and had a disk-like shape. SOURCE further estimated their speed in "thousands of miles per hour". SOURCE said the lights were traveling "so rapidly that they were high enough to reflect the sun's light."
IV. SOURCE'S ESTIMATE: SOURCE states that the sightings were "a phenomenon of material devices that appear to be propelled by an unknown force but that they were apparently controlling their speed and direction". SOURCE believes earth-made devices would be capable of travelling that high and that fast.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. Mr. (redacted) GJJ-2520, with the Air Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport, was contacted. He stated that the sighting referred to in the 25 August UFOB sighting report originated at the US Weather Bureau at the Washington National Airport. The Weather Bureau had only made observations of the sighting.
2. Mr. (redacted), assigned to the US Weather Bureau at the Washington National Airport, was contacted. He stated that his office had only made observations of the sighting and had forwarded a report thereon to the 1401st Air Base Wing officials at Andrews AFB who called his office for weather data at the time of the sighting.
3. Andrews AFB Operations and Weather (GCdr GJJ-2918) was contacted but had no information or records in regard to the 23 August CB sighting.
4. Bolling AFB Operations and Weather (GCdr GJN-5357) likewise offered no confirmation or information regarding the 23 August sighting.
5. The Assistant Chief of Meteorological Observations, US Weather Bureau, Washington, D.C., was contacted by telephone. He stated: 1) That weather balloons are launched every six hours by the US Weather Service. 2) That these balloons can give an accurate account of other meteorological phenomena contained in the upper atmosphere, i.e. a magneto ball or an auto-rotating disc, and 3) That the sighting in question could be accounted for as a weather phenomenon and would be ascertained within 10-12 minutes.
6. The Director of the Silver Hill Weather Station, Mr. Arpone, disclosed that a second balloon was launched from the premises on 23 August 1955 at 10:00 EST. It had travelled in a north-easterly direction (toward Arlington, Virginia). Arlington officials have been notified, and increasing according to the general rate of ascent, it would have reached an approximate altitude of 95,000 feet.
7. The US Naval Observatory, Washington, D.C., was contacted by telephone but had no information regarding the sighting in question. Observation through the telescope has sometimes shown objects high in the atmosphere which might produce this impression. Since they have been unable to confirm the exact nature of these objects, they are at a loss to explain the sighting in question.

9. Sighting and nothing unusual was reported by his various installations.
10. Lt. Beale of the 647th ACAW Sq., V.A. reported that he had received no information which would indicate any confirmation of the Arlington sighting.
11. The Baltimore-Washington Filter Center gave a negative report on the UFOB sighting of 7 August 1955.
12. Finally, the Cincinnati flight Service Center was questioned about the sighting. Capt. Anderson, the officer on duty at Middletown, reported that his office had received no information in confirmation of UFOB sighting on 23 August.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FLIGHT 3-H, 45024 AISS
REPORT NO: 28-CB-7-59

PART FOUR

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the 23 August 1955 sighting of a UFO in the Arlington, Va. area was caused by misinterpreting the sighting of a single balloon observed for a considerable time, which then took on characteristics resembling those of a flying object. This conclusion is based on the following:

a. The general appearance the first object is clearly observed suggests a change in color and size during the observation, which is indicative of an optical effect rather than a true change in the object itself.
b. The fact that the object remained relatively stationary over the area for an extended period of time, approximately 10-15 minutes, and was observed to traverse only a small portion of the sky, is not consistent with the characteristics of a true flying object.
c. The fact that the object was observed to be traveling in the direction of the prevailing wind tends to indicate that it was a balloon rather than a controlled flying object.

Also, this balloon which was within ten to twelve minutes after launching could have.been touched for at least two minutes by the observers on the ground possessing 8X10 binoculars.

2. The apparent changing pattern high above the city could easily have created the apparent directional changing phenomenon, which, if accompanied by a reflection or refraction effect from the object, might have accentuated the appearance of a controlled or directed type object.

3. In conclusion, it is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting can best be explained as the observation of a weather balloon, possibly reflecting or refracting light, and exhibiting characteristics which gave the impression of a controlled or directed type flying object to those unfamiliar with the behavior of such atmospheric phenomena.

Officer in Charge

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
1. Further investigation requested of Flight 3-H revealed that radar contacts were made in the Arlington area near the time of the sighting. The initial object apparently showed rapid, close-in, eratic maneuvers characteristic of the characteristics of the first object as a true balloon. This latter conclusion as to the origin and behavior of the phenomena would be consistent with the officer being unfamiliar with celestial activity, such as a reflection, which might create the mind's acquaintance with such observed phenomena.

2. This report is forwarded to ATIC as "UNKNOWNS".
