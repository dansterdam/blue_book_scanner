III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

    "On August 23, 1955 at about 10:45 pm EST, my friend (Rev.        ) and I were standing near the south side of my house, facing to the south, when my attention was called to a moving object in the sky. It was orange in color and was travelling south at a high altitude and great speed. After observing its flight for about fifteen seconds, it turned east and disappeared almost ten seconds later. Shortly afterwards we were scanning the sky and another object of the same type appeared in the southwest. It remained visible for two or three minutes. At one time we could spot three of them travelling a great distance apart and in the same general direction, but shortly afterwards they took different courses. One circled the dome of the sky while the other made a semi-circle and reversed itself before returning on its original course. The other circled the dome of the sky and then turned and went directly across the dome of the sky. Another appeared to come to a complete stop and then it continued on its regular course. While it was standing still it looked like one of those in a burning, it appeared to have a red dome which was visible through the binoculars. The objects appeared to be above the atmosphere of the earth since they didn't appear to lose altitude as an object would when passing over the horizon. They never showed signs of losing their brilliance and didn't fly in formation at any time. I think that the visible light was due to reflection from the sun."

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE had been observing stars through his friend's telescope when he noticed a light in the sky which he at first presumed to be a jet. It suddenly disappeared but no sound seemed to accompany the light. Shortly afterwards, SOURCE related seeing three different and distinct lights in the sky, each appearing to be moving in a different direction from the other two.

The objects seemed to possess a bright orange color and have disk-like shapes. SOURCE further estimated their speed in "thousands of miles per hour" in order to go across the dome of the sky in a few minutes." SOURCE'S estimate of the altitude above the earth at which these objects were travelling was that they were "high enough to reflect the sun's light."

In conclusion, SOURCE stated that he wasn't sure whether the objects were a phenomenon of nature or a mechanical device, but that he was inclined to believe that they were mechanical/aerial devices of another plane, but also didn't believe any Earth-made device would be capable of travelling that high and that fast.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFECTS:

1. A check with the Air Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport, (Gedef GJN 5836), for information in confirmation of the 23 August UFO sighting, yielded negative results.

2. Mr. _______ assigned to the US Weather Bureau at the Washington National Airport (see incl/1), stated that his only knowledge of the sighting came from 1101st Air Base Wing official's at Andrews AFB who called his office for weather data at the time of the sighting.

3. Andrews AFB Operations and Weather (Gedef GJPJ 0718) was contacted but had no information to give in regard to the 23 August UFO sighting.

4. Bolling AFB Operations and Weather (Gedef GJNJ 5857) likewise offered no confirmation.

5. The Assistant Chief of Meteorological Observations, US Weather Bureau, Washington, D.C., very cordially furnished the following information on balloons controlled by the US Weather Service: 1) That weather balloons are launched every six hours by the Silver Spring station (through the country). 2) These balloons often are of the 500# radosonde variety, containing either a magnesium bulb or an auto-activated illuminating attachment. Either of these two types of lighting would be difficult to observe once the carrier reaches an altitude of 10,000 ft., which, assuming average rate of ascent to be 600ft./min., would be accomplished within 10-12 minutes. 3) That the Silver Hill Weather Station, (Gedef GJW-0550), is the principal station operated by the US Weather Service in the Washington vicinity.

6. The Director of the Silver Hill Weather Station, Mr. Argonne, disclosed that a regular balloon trip had been released on the evening of 23 August at 10:00 EST. It had travelled in a northeasterly direction (toward Arlington, Virginia) as it disappeared from view. By 10:15 EST, the balloon would have been directly over Arlington at an approximate altitude of 15,000 ft., and increasing according to its normal rate of ascent. Its course at this time could have been followed by binoculars.

7. The US Naval Observatory, Washington, D.C., was contacted by telephone but was unable to confirm the sighting. Mr. J.L. Gossner of the Observatory's Equatorial Division, when told of the traversing and random shifting of the UFO, mentioned that the turbulence from the earth's atmosphere might produce this impression if a star were observed through these conditions. Mr. Gossner could not say the phenomenon seemed doubtful to him. (This was the type of binoculars used by the Arlington observers.) Mr. _______ further stated that on the night of 23 August at approximately 1015 EST he had noticed a bright light in the sky accompanied by a red light, though there was no sound audible, he felt that the lights were from an aircraft flying at an extremely high altitude. He reported that he had changed direction several times while he was observing it. His suggestion was that the Arlington observers may have seen the same thing with no doubt, but merely had interpreted it differently.

8. Maj. Sloan of the 75th AA Bn, Andrews AFB, Maryland, was contacted but was unable to confirm any of the sighting with positive radar data.

9. Likewise, Maj. Sutton, AA Ops Officer, 19th AA Group, charged with the AA defense of the Washington area, very courteously offered that his unit had had 25-30 radar scanners operating in his Area of responsibility at the time of the (cont. p.5)

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the 23 August 1955 sighting of a UFOB in the Washington, D.C. area was caused by misinterpretations of the changing course of an ascending Ranade weather balloon by observers on the ground, combined by the later sighting of a high flying aircraft bearing multiple lights, changing directional and apparently ending in sound. Though there was actually no association between the first and second object, the fact that the second phenomenon appeared so closely upon the first created the misconception that the two were associated.

a. In general appearance the first clearly observed object was orange in color and had a disc-like configuration, which seems to leave no doubt that this object could have been a weather balloon. The Silver Hill rasonde balloon was launched at approximately 1000 EST and was observed to be traveling in the direction of Arlington as it passed from the view of the weather station.

b. Also, this balloon which within ten to twelve minutes after launching could have been tracked for at least 25 minutes thereafter by observers on ground possessing G100 binoculars.

c. An aircraft flying a changing pattern high above the city could easily have created the apparent directional changing phenomena, which, if accompanied by no sound and appearing closely after the sighting of the first object, may quickly have been attributed by excited observers on the ground to strange flying objects, either in or from outer space. This latter conclusion as to the origin and location of the object or objects might at first appear ridiculous, but to a person who is more readily acquainted with celestial activity, such an assumption might enter the mind quite readily.---- Both observers were confident that what they saw had not come from Earth.

d. One of the principal reasons the observers doubted that the phenomena could have been caused from a rising balloon or an aircraft traversing the sky was its apparent speed. The speed of an object when recorded by the naked eye can be highly deceptive, particularly at night.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. Further investigation requested of Flight 3-H revealed that radar contacts were negative in the Arlington area at the time of the sighting, eliminating aircraft as a cause of the sighting. Although winds aloft could substantiate the course of the first object as being a balloon, the speed and duration of the sighting do not correlate with those of a balloon. The other objects, similar in description to the first, do not conform to any known phenomena.

2. This report is forwarded to ATIC as "Unknown".
