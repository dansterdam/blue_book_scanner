slightly larger than the ordinary star and possibly a little brighter than the average star. The objects were completely soundless. After they had proceeded on their course for two or three minutes I looked at something else in the next field when next I looked at the sky the objects weren't there any more. I can add nothing else to this statement.

In conclusion I make a brief summary of all the data reported to me during the course of this investigation.

At 0015 hours 19 July 1952 two unidentified objects were seen straddling across the sky in a southwesterly direction by six observers on a test located at approximately 40 degrees, 3 minutes west, 74 degrees north. All members of the party observed two objects, and the three witnesses interviewed described the objects as follows: The objects were two in number, slightly larger, and were of a yellow-orange color. They were soundless and seemed to follow a very definite course across the sky. Both objects remained the same distance from each other, and it was this fact that made the observers note that the objects were not stars. The observers followed the objects with their eyes for as long as they were in sight, and after their disappearance have unable to detect them again.

STATEMENT OF INFORMANT CONCERNING RELIABILITY OF WITNESSES IN PRESENT INVESTIGATION:

From the information I now possess I would adjudge Mr. [illegible] to be a fairly reliable witness. He is Vice President of [illegible] Inc., and is a former Major in the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps. He appeared quite sincere in telling his story, and gave the same description throughout the interview. He is approximately 40 years of age.

Mrs. [illegible] is a housewife, the mother of three children, and a very cool and collected person. Although she has had no previous experience of this type before, I would judge her to be fairly reliable.

Mrs. [illegible] is a woman of about 29 years, with no experience in incidents of this nature before. She was quite self-possessed, and I would also judge her to be fairly reliable. All witnesses appeared very sincere, and gave the impression of having the intent to aid the Air Force in my way possible in the investigation of this sighting. I should judge the report to be possibly true (2-).

STATEMENT BY MAJOR JOSEPH H. SMITH:

I have coordinated with Sgt Washburn during all phases of this investigation and concur with his evaluation of the sources and of the report.

Newark, N. J.

July 29, 1952

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a report of an observation of two objects ("lights") seen in the sky on the night of July 19-20 over Lavalette, N. J. Since these lights were very similar to those reported over Washington, D.C., the same night, and since they did not resemble any aircraft known to the observers, either in appearance or in manner of motion and disappearance, I am submitting a complete description for possible correlation with other similar reports. I have purposely delayed this report since I have no intention of allowing my name to be associated in "newsprint" with the so-called "flying saucer scare". Therefore, while I am giving my name and position below, I request that they be used only for your files, or be given only to the Air Force should you judge this report worth passing on to them.

The objects described were witnessed by myself and a companion. We have carefully compared our impressions, and the description given consists of those impressions agreed upon by both.

Description of Objects Seen In Sky on July 20, 1952, over Lavalette, N. J.

Time:   Approx. 12:20 to 12:25 a.m., Sunday, July 20.

Place:  Seen from boardwalk, just east of center of Lavalette, N.J.

Description of Objects:

a.  Two moving lights were seen, each having the same appearance: approximately round, and orange-yellow in color with dull red alternately diffusing over much of the surface. They seemed about five times the apparent-size of Venus or Jupiter, but only two or three times as bright.

b.  The "lights" were first seen towards the south, just off-shore, about 15 to 10° above the center of the "milky way", at an approximate elevation-angle of 40°. They moved northward slowly, one behind the other and following nearly the same path. They appeared to be at least 3- to 4-mile apart and moving at less than 100 m.p.h. (assuming their apparent-distance from the observers of five- to ten-miles.) At the point where they passed almost due east of the observers, they appeared to be at least 500 ft. high, the approx. elevation-angle being 45°. The second, or trailing, light did not keep constant-distance or course with the leading object.

c.  Shortly after passing to the east of the observers, both lights gradually began to turn westward towards land, passing over the coastline at approx. 60°-elevation north of the observers. Continuing to circle, the lights passed to the west at approx. 50°-elevation, then around to the south, re-crossing the shore-line at about the same angle. During this first circling, both lights grew smaller and fainter, but more yellow in color; the trailing light one grew fainter more rapidly, and appeared to drop further behind and to shift course slightly to south of the leading one. At no time did any sound come from the lights.

d.  Out at sea, they continued circling, the radius of turn being much smaller, such that the brighter leading object crossed the shoreline just south of the observers, at about 300-elevation. Both continued to grow much fainter, smaller and more silvery in color, occasionally disappearing and reappearing, as though passing over high, thin clouds. The second light completely disappeared just over the shoreline. The first light continued westward, very faint like a small star; it seemed many miles high, and moving more rapidly. It finally disappeared in the west at about a 50°-elevation. The total elapsed time from first sighting to final disappearance was about five or six minutes.

NOTE: When the objects were first seen, they resembled night-weather-balloons ("pibal-balloons") carrying candle-lantern). However, their reddish color and circular course were not at all like such a balloon. Their motion gave the definite impression of directed control, but the complete silence of the objects and their apparent rapid climbing to very high altitude did not resemble (to the observers) any known plane or dirigible.

Report of Investigation of Unidentified Objects Sighted in the Air at Day, Naval, and Holloman Air Force Base, Alamogordo, N.M. on 20 July 1952

[Partially redacted text about an investigation by Major Joseph H. King, Operations Officer, 548th Air Base Group]

At 1230 hours I interviewed [redacted] and obtained the following narrative:

"At approximately 1215 p.m. Sunday, July 20th I was on board my boat with my wife and two other couples on the astronomical river near some mills near New Hamm, New Jersey. The night was very clear. Wind direction southwest at 3 miles per hour. The sky was a bright blue with a few scattered clouds. Appeared to be a bright star moving out of the galaxy of the Milky Way. A second object of the same size and brightness appeared about 100 degrees to the last west of the first object. It was moving as the same speed and in the same direction. They were about 1/2 degree above the horizon about 1/2 of our position moving in a 21 to 25° direction. Could distinguish two different shapes, one was visible as far more distinct than the other. No change the shape in the Big Dipper. They appeared to be about as far apart as the two stars in the Big Dipper. They were measured at 20-60 degrees. Masses of other couples are Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] and [redacted].

Location of 40 degrees, 53 minutes north, 74 degrees west. Mr. _______ located
that he had been on a river near Washington, D.C. and unidentified objects were
sighted in by water over Washington, D.C. and decided to report this significant
sighting to the Air Force because he thought that the two objects he might have
seen part of the same reported over Washington. Two objects were seen ______
by one of the men at the party. Etc.

Interrogation of Mr. _______ by Special Agent _______ G. WASHBURN, Jr.

S/Sgt Washburn: What made you first notice these objects?

Mr. ______: One of the girls yelled out to look at the strange shooting stream.

S/Sgt Washburn: Do you believe they were shooting stars?

Mr. ______: No, I don't. For one thing they didn't travel in an arc, but
followed a straight course across the sky, and for another, they left no trail
when observed.

S/Sgt Washburn: How long did you sight the objects?

Mr. ______: We saw them anywhere from one to three minutes.

S/Sgt Washburn: What were you doing out on the river at the time of the
sighting?

Mr. ______: We had been to a dance, and as it was extremely hot, we decided to
go out for a ride to cool off.

S/Sgt Washburn: How fast were the objects travelling across the sky?

Mr. ______: They weren't going along very fast at all - seemed to be drifting
along rather than speeding, and if it hadn't been for the fact that they were
in a straight line, I would have thought that they might possibly have been
balloons drifting along, blown by the wind.

S/Sgt Washburn: Did the objects make any sound, Mr. ______?

Mr. ______: No, they were completely soundless.

S/Sgt Washburn: How was the weather at the time of the sighting, Mr. ______?

Mr. ______: The weather was very clear with a very slight breeze and no moon.

S/Sgt Washburn: How far above did the objects appear to be?

Mr. ______: They appeared to be about the same distance from each other as the
two steps in the side of the Big Dipper.

FIND OF INTERROGATION OF MRS. [REDACTED] BY S/SGT WASHINGTON

On 24 July, 1952 I travelled to Bay Head, New Jersey, where I interviewed Mrs. [redacted]. Both of these women gave approximately the same description as follows: with the exception of the length of time observed, both of the women believed the objects to have been observed for approximately two to three minutes. Rather than one estimate, I will note that both included transcription of the interrogation of Mrs. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted], and Mrs. [redacted] followed closely the same lines as the rest of this report will be copies of the statements of Mrs. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted].

STATEMENT OF MRS. [REDACTED]

I was with my husband and the other persons he mentioned on the night, 29 July 1952, and on the morning of the 20th of July when the entire group witnessed an unidentified object described by Mr. [redacted] in his statement. I have read my husband's statement and concur with it in every respect, except that I believe that we saw the object for approximately two or three minutes more than my husband. The two objects that we saw were very distinct and it is my firm belief that the objects were not stars. I base this belief on the very apparent factory:

1. The objects stayed the same distance apart all during the observation.
2. The objects travelled in a straight line throughout the sighting.

The weather was very clear on the night of the sighting with a very slight breeze and few if any clouds.

I was probably the second or third person to sight the objects and continued to observe it with the exception of the few times I spoke to someone standing beside me.

I can add nothing else to this statement.

[Signature redacted]

STATEMENT OF MRS. [REDACTED]

On the night of 19 July 1952, I, my husband, [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted], witnessed two strange unidentified objects in the sky. While we [redacted] looked out on the headsigns in order to cool off. I was the first person to notice these objects appear on or the balcony [redacted]. We were travelling along together and I think that perhaps they were travelling in some sort of a formation. The objects moved slightly but were not doing at an excessive rate of speed. I called everyone's attention to these as soon as I noticed them, and we watched them for approximately two to three minutes. They appeared to be going Southeast toward Washington, D.C. The objects were
