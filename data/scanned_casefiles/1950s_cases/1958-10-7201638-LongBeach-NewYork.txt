ASTRONOMY

Mars Still Brightens
As Mars becomes brighter in the October evening sky, astronomers prepare to study the total eclipse of the sun on Oct. 12.

By JAMES STOKLEY
▶ STEADILY DRAWING closer to earth, the red planet Mars is becoming brighter than any star, or any other planet, visible in the evening sky. At a distance of 63,000,000 miles on Oct. 1, it will be only 52,700,000 miles from us on the 31st. It will then be approaching its minimum distance of 45,310,000 miles, which it reaches on Nov. 8.

Mars rises in the east about 8:00 p.m., your own kind of standard time (add one hour for daylight saving) at the beginning of October, or about two hours after sunset. It is then in the constellation of Taurus, the bull, which can be seen low in the west.

Its position is shown on the accompanying maps. These pictures the sky as it appears around 10:00 p.m., your own kind of standard time. (See 1:20 p.m. Eastern Standard Time for other times). Experienced astronomers, its brightness increases during October from minus 12 to minus 1.8, which is an increase of 75%. It is now about ten times as bright as the first magnitude star Aldebaran, which is below Mars, also in Taurus. Another star of this magnitude, and even brighter, is Capella, in Auriga; the character, which is just to the left of Taurus.

Vega Now Brightest
Brightest star of the October evenings, however, is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre, high in the northwest. Directly above it is Cygnus, the swan, in which Deneb is the lucida, the most brilliant star. Altair, also of the first magnitude, appears to the left of Lyra, in Aquila, the eagle.

A little earlier in the evening than the times for which the maps are prepared, you can see another planet, Saturn. It is in Ophiuchus, part of which is shown, in the west Saturn sets, at the beginning of October, about 9:30.

The other naked eye planets are not easily visible in October. Mercury is too nearly in the same direction as the sun. The same is true of Jupiter, which was shining so brightly in the southwest a month or two ago.

Venus has been shining very brightly in the morning sky, just before sunrise. At the first of October it will appear above the eastern horizon about an hour ahead of the sun, and may be glimpsed if you have a clear view in that direction. By the end of the month, however, it will rise only a few minutes before sunrise, and will not be visible.

As the moon goes through its phases during October, it will reach the new phase on Columbus Day, Oct. 12, at 3:52 p.m., EST. Whenever the moon is new, it is nearly in the same direction as the sun, which is why we cannot then see it. The moon is illuminated only by sunlight, and then the half on which the sun is shining is turned away from us.

Ordinarily at new moon, however, that body does not come squarely between sun and earth, but rather it goes a little north or south of the line joining the two bodies. But occasionally the moon does pass directly between them. Then its shadow may fall on some part of the earth, and from the region where the shadow covers, the sun is hidden from view. That is, there is a total eclipse of the sun.

Such an event will happen on Columbus Day, Oct. 12. The eclipse will not be visible in the United States or any part of North America, but many scientists from various nations have migrated temporarily to some small islands in the South Pacific where it can be observed.

At 1:20 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, from a point in the Pacific near the Marshall Islands, which are about half way between Hawaii and New Guinea, the sun will be just rising. An observer at that place, looking carefully, would see a tiny nick in the upper edge of the solar disc. This would be the moon, as the eclipse was just beginning. However, from this position he never would see the sun completely hidden.

The total eclipse will be visible along a path more than a hundred miles wide, starting at a point on the equator, north of the Solomon Islands. Here, at 2:17 p.m., EST, the sun would just be rising totally eclipsed. The tip of the moon's shadow, which is shaped like a cone, would just be touching earth. From there it sweeps in a southeasterly direction, tracing out the path of totality, until it leaves the earth, near San Luis, in the interior of Argentina.

There are a number of small islands in this path, and it is to these that the astronomers have traveled, since the most satisfactory eclipse observations require solid ground under the instruments. Five expeditions have gone from the United States to the Danger Islands, a group formed by a coral atoll at 10 degrees 25 minutes south latitude and 169 degrees 50 minutes west longitude. Their observations are part of the International Geophysical Year, the great project to study the earth and its surroundings, in which virtually all the nations of the earth are cooperating.

A naval vessel, the USS Thomaston, which is an LSD (landing ship dock, a kind of floating drydock), reached the eclipse site early in September. Since the entrance to the lagoon is not large enough to permit a ship of this size to enter, and the water offshore is too deep for an anchorage, it has

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Study the Corona

Although it is no longer necessary, as it was a few years ago, to wait for a total eclipse to observe the sun's outermost layer, the corona, this region can only be seen and photographed in its greatest detail and extent at such a time. Thus, many of the observations will be to record the corona, which changes in step with the 11-year cycle of solar activity.

Other studies will be made of the solar atmosphere, which is at the rim of the bright disc as we ordinarily see it. Just at the beginning, and end, of a total eclipse, part of this layer can be observed by itself, as the rest of the sun is covered. This will be done with the aid of spectroscopes which analyze its light and yield many valuable data.

Of course, such observations require a clear sky, and the New Zealand Weather Bureau has estimated that the chances of clear weather at eclipse time are 60%. But possible cloudy will not affect the six Nile Asp two-stage rockets that will be fired at a height of 150 miles; two before, two during and two after totality. These will be sent aloft from the Thomaston, and will make records of short ultraviolet rays and X-rays from the sun, radiations that do not reach the ground. Radio observations will also be made, to determine changes in the high atmosphere as it is momentarily in the moon's shadow.

Eastern Washington

Big Fiery Object Seen
In Early Morning Sky

On the 18th of the month---
A big fiery object flashed a
cross the sky in Eastern
Washington early Friday and
a weather observer at Spokane said, "it was as bright
as lighting, too bright for a
shooting star". It was reported to have been seen from Spokane to Pasco
and Prosser ( Near the secret US Plutonium works at Hanford, Wa. Ed)

Deputy sheriff William H. Miller of Spokane County said the object lit up
the ground around the patrol car in the Spokane Valley for from 15 to 20
seconds and the object cast shadows from nearby objects. Spokane city
police said they also saw it. Other reports came in from Othello.

CLOSE SIGHTING AT DISNEYLAND, CALIFORNIA: Almost as if some new wonderful exhibit were undergoing secret midnight tests, a brightly-glowing bling-shaped UFO was seen floating 500 yards above Walt Disney's famous Disneyland park in Garden Grove, California, last Oct. 23rd. It was seen by Richard Oetrich, who spotted the object while driving home at 12:30 a.m. along a nearby street. He described the object as the size and shape of a blimp, surrounded by a halo glow, and with three or four brightly shining colored lights in its center. It also had a tail about three or four times the length of the object itself, with a bright light shining at the end. The UFO was in view for about two minutes. Eventually it took a sharp dive toward the ground and disappeared in a bright flash, without making any noise.

24 October, 1958
Stayton & Mill City, Oregon

On Friday night the 24th of Oct. others saw similar performances... Strange sky objects were apparently hovering in Marion County and Friday night, judging from reports of two valley Police chiefs.

Stayton Police Chief, Everette Norfleet, Sgt. Ronald Frey and another Stayton man reported seeing an object in the Northeast sky traveling Southwest at 7:30 PM while they were on a routine police patrol.

"It looked like an evening star with a tail below it," Norfleet said. "I've watched for flying saucers ever since they were mentioned and I never saw anything like this," he added.

The object was reported to have been a light "star" color gradually changing to a ruddy glow and evening like a pendulum. It was watched from some 15 minutes and still in view when the men resumed their police duties.

At the same time, Mill City Chief of Police, Clarence Meader reported seeing an object moving East from where he was watching, North of Mill City.

I am not saying what it was, Meader said, reporting that it was a clear bright blue point of light. The object was seen later in the evening from a point west of Mill City. This time it was moving West, Meader said.

Although there were jet planes reported in the area Friday night, both men said they were familiar with jets, and that the object was something else.
