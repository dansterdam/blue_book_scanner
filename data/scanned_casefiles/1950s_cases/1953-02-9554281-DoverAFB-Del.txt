Intelligence Division, ATLD-WATS
Westover AF Base, Mass.         TR-171-53                     22 February 1953

1. "Approximately 2100 hours 22 February 1953, 2nd Lt Leland S. Haines Jr., AO 1229, (Witness-of-the-day), this base, received telephone call from a Mr. A. Nichols, civilian, of R.D. #2, Milford, Delaware, who had a strange object in the sky under scrutiny. Nichols could not describe the size of this "disc-shaped" object but stated that it had a predominantly yellowish color with a "red, then a very bright white light turning not too fast, but steady, under the yellow glow." From his position at Milford (Thomsonville) Delaware (approximately 75°41'E by 38°53'N), placed the object over the town of Frederica, proceeding from a southerly course to north.

2. "Haines, at the Base Theater (approximately 75°47'N by 39°07'W), after receiving information from Nichols, observed an object fitting reported description at an estimated altitude of 1,000' due west of the base, over the city of Dover, but at an undetermined distance. Haines summoned Airman Second Class Candido, AT 1229140, Assistant Theater Manager, to verify his observances. Haines and Candido substantially agreed that the object appeared approximately 4° to 5° above the horizon, appeared to revolve with alternate colors red, green, blue to white. In a manner similar to the brilliant reflection from the "face of a diamond. Their period of observation was over a half-hour, beginning at 2100 hours.

3. "When Haines directed attention of Control Tower personnel to the location of the object he was informed by Lt.man Basic Leonard G. Whitney, AF 11130, that he and another operator had noticed the object since 1900 hours and jointly agreed that it was "probably the 'Evening Star'." About 2130 hours, when Dover Tower was contacted by pilot of military aircraft of the 96th FIS, New Castle County Airport, Delaware, Whitney observed that plane number one had to land because his fuel was low. Plane number two piloted by 1st Lt Molly Haddox pursued the object on a weather heading after climbing to 15,000 feet. At this altitude the object appeared level with him but at an undetermined distance. Haddox climbed to 45,000 feet on the same heading and found the object slightly below him and in a hazy area. Object was described as predominantly white in color and did not appear to be moving. Haddox flew as far as Baltimore vicinity without closing on the object, and considered further efforts fruitless. Radar Operator reported no scope sights. Negative traffic in area of original and subsequent object sighting.

4. "Existing weather at time of observation was clear sky, no haze, no clouds, visibility seven (7) miles, sea level pressure 280, temperature 30°, dew point 23, surface winds calm, altimeter reading 30.37. Washington, D.C. 1600 hour forecast 22 February 1953 revealed winds aloft at 12,000 feet from 210° at 50 knots, 16,000 feet from 210° at 70 knots, 20,000 feet from 210° at 110 knots.

5. "All witnesses appeared as sincere and creditable persons and it is believed that 'statement' as to altitude, and other data contained in their statements, which might appear implausible or incongruous to the trained technician, would constitute an honest error in judgment rather than an intended hoax or deception for purposes of notoriety or other."

I again went to New Castle "hotel" seeking a further report. My informant reported only what he had been able to hear over his radio. He stated that the pilot had seen the object, but had been unable to close with it, and had eventually lost it altogether.

No further information was forthcoming until the next morning when a full report was obtained from the Intelligence Officer of the 96th at New Castle. The information in his report is contained in other sections of this report.

I again went to the tower and, blowing my direction, the time personnel were also able to observe the object. However, they informed me that the object had been there "all evening".

My next efforts were directed to searching one aircraft for a closer look. The 46th PF Interceptor Sqdn at Dover was off alert and was being crewed by the 96th at New Castle AFB. I contacted the "hot room" at New Castle and supplied the necessary information. I was informed that two (2) aircraft were in CAP in the area and that they would be contacted immediately.

I then went to the tower and put the glasses on the object. It now was approximately 21:20. The object appears to be red in color where observed through the glasses. It was diminishing in size, giving the impression of movement away from my viewpoint.

While in the tower at New Castle it called in and asked for our location of this object. The tower operator estimated the object to be due west of the field and seven miles. The pilot of the aircraft stated that it was further away three seven miles inasmuch as he could see it from his castle 10 miles west of our location. Aircraft was based at Dover today.

I continued to observe the object through the glasses. At approximately 21:40 it disappeared entirely. I then left the tower.

22, 1953

My wife and I first saw what we thought
was a bright star about 8:30 P.M. as we watched
the object was getting closer. At 9:00 P.M.
we could make out a clear a ridge
shaped and very bright yellow glow
of light spinning in a clockwise direction.
The size seemed to be from 600 to 800 feet
up and about a mile from us. We saw
watched under the spinning bright
yellow light there was a red then a
very bright white light turning not
to fast but steady under the yellow
glow. The object stayed in one place
for awhile and would move straight
up for a hundred feet or so very sudden
then it would move down. At 9:45 P.M.
the object started to move off in a
north west direction from our home.
The light on moving off in a changed
direction until it disappeared over the
horizon, it seemed to go down over the
horizon just as a ship on the ocean wave.

Dover Air Force Base
24 February 1953

On the 1700 - 2400 shift in the Control Tower at Dover AFB, Delaware, this night of February 23, 1953, I received a telephone call from the Officer of the Day asking to look to the South to the base to see if I observed any unusual objects on the horizon. I advised him I would nothing on the horizon but stars. This call was between 2030 and 2105, at approximately 2115E the Officer of the Day came to the Tower, and stated that there was an unusual object to the West of the base. He told me that he had watched this object for some time and that it seemed to be rotating, and color from yellow to orange. I told him that the position on latitude with him and myself had agreed earlier that it was a large star. We watched this object and agreed that it was probably the Evening Star. This was shortly after dark, about 2030E. At about 2130E a military aircraft from New Castle County airport called Dover Tower and advised that it had attempted to fly to this object, and had flown as far as Baltimore, and was unable to reach it. The pilot did not tell the Tower what he himself thought it was. Shortly after the call from the aircraft, the object began to fade from view, and it seemed to be slowly moving to the North. It is my opinion that this object was a star. In a conversation with other Tower Operators I learned that they had seen a large star in approximately the same way as I had, and I believe they could possibly see the Evening Star.

Wilmington, Delaware

1. In accordance with AFR 200-5, 29 April 1952, the following report is submitted:

    a. This unit was alerted by the OD of Dover AFB at approximately 0200Z
    23 February 1953 that a very bright white light was bending toward New Castle. One
    T-6A4 aircraft with pilot 1st Lt. Joseph Old and radar observer 2nd Lt John R. Monaghan
    was in the air at this time and was alerted to be on the lookout for this reported object.
    The lookout was in the tower at this time and was alerted by the New Castle Tower to be on
    the alert to be the reported object while on the final approach to the runway 27. They
    believed to be the reported object while on the final approach to the runway 27 as a very brilliant
    object appearing straight ahead off the opposite end of runway 27 as a very brilliant
    white light moving from south to north at an estimated 2 miles distance and at an
    altitude of 1000 feet. The intensity of the light kept changing. Pilot 1st Lt Maddox
    decided against investigating the light as he had only 50 gallons of fuel remaining and
    made the T-6A4 aircraft was in take off position. The aircraft was in take off position
    on runway 27 (pilot 1st Lt Maddox and radar observer 2nd Lt Leonard A. Levy)
    was airborne at 23/0215 and observed the light immediately after take off at approxi-
    mately 15-20 degrees to the starboard. The pilot continued climbing and observed it
    same but reported that it was extremely great. Aircraft continued climbing on a
    heading of 270 degrees keeping the light under surveillance. Upon reaching 15000
    feet the light appeared to be at the same altitude and still approximately 15
    miles distant. Pilot continued climbing leveled off at 25000 feet.
    The light then appeared slightly lower than the aircraft, still at approximately 15-
    20 degrees starboard. The aircraft flew on a westerly heading for approximately 15
    minutes but did not close on the light. The unidentified light did not move. On
    the preliminary teletype report (Misc 0065) the above some information was given but
    after further investigation the pilot, who was previously a navigator, states that
    after checking an almanac he definitely believes the light to be the planet Jupiter.
    The New Castle Tower operator, who also observed this light, called the local news-
    paper with the thought that perhaps others had seen this light and called the news-
    paper office to report same. The local newspaper stated that they had seen the light
    in question and believed it to be the planet mercury.

    b. Pilot 1st Lt Maddox has been a navigator for 6 years and a pilot for 3
    years and the total of 1200 flying hours. The radar observer 2nd Lt Leonard A. Levy
    has been flying as a radar observer for 11 months and has 109 hours of observer time.

    c. The weather during sighting was clear, unlimited visibility with a very
    light haze layer at 20000 feet.

Dover Air Force Base, Delaware                                                22 February 1952

At approximately 2100 hours, 22 February, acting in my capacity as O.D., I accepted a call from a Mr. [redacted], Milford, Delaware - Phone [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] stated that he had observed and was observing a strange object in the sky. He estimated the object to be 4-5° above the horizon from his viewpoint, moving South to North and approximately over the town of Felton, Delaware.

He further stated that the object appeared to be spinning and that it was predominantly yellowish in color. However, it also appeared to be slowly changing colors, turning white, green, and red at various times.

I next contacted the Dover AFB Tower to see if the tower personnel were able to observe this object. I was informed that they could not see any object of the above description in the direction I gave them.

I then stepped outside of the Base Theater and was able to see this object due West of the base. I estimated the object to be around 1000 feet and over the town of West Dover. Mr. [redacted] had further stated that the object best resembled the light thrown off by an electric arc welder. The object tallied with those of Mr. [redacted], too, insomuch as the gradual change of colors. It was much the same as the unusual of colors thrown off by a cut diamond when.
