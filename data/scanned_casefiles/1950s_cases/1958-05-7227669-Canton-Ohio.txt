I saw the object almost the whole time I got up when I called the weather bureau a moment ago, Decided to wait but my wife said hurry as she called me to see.  Right away I got an idea I wished it go at night and I went outside to see the finish and watch and listened to it.  And I could hardly stand the shock stand the shock it made me so nervous.

Total observe it. I hope that this information can be of some help. Definitely believe it was no plane or any object we were observed before. When it stopped I came into the house to call, it actually stood still 2 or 3 minutes. about as it were above a very slight wispy cloud came to light, seemed to reflect on cloud, then it moved to the east again, got dim and then bright again, but not as bright as when directly overhead. It disappeared with a slight pause.

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
NAME OR TITLE: Major Le J. TACKER
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: SAFIS-3 - OSAF 
REMARKS:
1. Larger here is a letter from an individual reporting after a UFO. This gives him credit for not sending it to Keesler Base Provost Marshal here. Suggest the following answer:
1. Our preliminary conclusion is that it was a balloon launched at night, probably from Warren, Ohio, by the Weather Bureau. Information shows that balloons were launched at Warren were in the direction of Canton from Warren. Further, his description of the object and the movements indicate the balloon movements characteristic of a balloon in flight.
2. We are adding his report to the many others we receive in our continuing investigation of aerial phenomena.
3. Thanks for sending it to the Air Force.
