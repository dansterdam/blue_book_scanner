Still observe it-

I hope that this information can be of some help. I plainly can believe it was no plane or any object I've ever observed before. When it stopped I came into the house to call it actually stood still. It seemed to get very bright all at once, almost as if it were about a slight swing of hand came to lift seemed to reflect on clouds then it moved to the eastward got dim and then bright again but not as bright as when directly overhead, then it disappeared behind clouds.

MEMO ROUTING SLIP

Name or Title: Major E. J. TACKER
Organization and Location: SAFIS-3 - OSAF

Remarks:
Larry- Here is a letter from an individual reporting a UFO. Must give him credit for not sending it to Keyhoe after reading his book. I got into the hands of the Base Provost Marshal here. Suggest the following answer:

1. Our preliminary conclusion is that it was a balloon probably from Warren, Ohio, by the Weather Bureau, Warren is about 40 miles northeast of Canton. Investigation shows that balloons were launched at Warren on the night of his sighting and that the prevailing winds were in the direction of Canton from Warren. Further, his description of the object and its movements indicate the strong possibility that it was a balloon.

2. We are adding this report to the many others we receive in our continuing investigation of aerial phenomena.

3. Thanks for sending it to the Air Force.
