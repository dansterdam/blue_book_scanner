TO: Commander, Air Force Cambridge Research Center, ATTN: C807,
Lawrence G. Hansen Field, Bedford, Massachusetts

1. This Center has reviewed and subjected color transparencies
to a number of tests to determine the nature of the spots found on
individual frames.

2. For purposes of return of the transparencies to their owner
in accordance with para 19g, AFR 200-2 and any suggested reply your
office may make, the following are this Center's findings
and comments:

a. The black objects in transparencies were undoubtedly
created during processing and probably caused by air bubbles during
emulsion during first developer which prevented these areas from
developing and then when exposed and developed, black images
appeared during second developer.

b. These images show no signs or gradation which would
result in case of objects actually flying in the sky or not of being
black.

c. There are certain puzzling aspects regarding this
matter.

d. It appears odd that a professional photographer would
ask the Air Force to identify what appears to be the result of
emulsion, developing or camera-equipment flaws.

e. R. I. T. has some of the finest equipment in the country
- photo analysis, which were virtually not able to occur.

f. The fact that the source feared ridicule as the reason why
he waited over two (2) years to submit the photos is questioned.

3. Previous experience with alleged flying saucer photo-
graphy submitted by professional photographers has resulted in some
unfounded accusations against the Air Force.

3. A very intensive check of the Air Force UFO case files dis-
closed no reports of UFOs or anything unusual from the radar units,
CAA posts, military and civil aircraft or others in that area for
the general time of the year shown in the photographs. Anything this
large seen in broad daylight would have been seen and reported by
many people.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO:    Commander

        Dayton, Ohio

1. The attached negatives were submitted to this office by a Mr. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who is a professional photographer now in the employ of M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratories. The photographs were taken nearly two years ago and were not submitted during that time for fear of ridicule. The purported objects appeared at the top of the film and seem to indicate a vertical and horizontal movement. The pictures were taken facing out over the Charles River with Boston on the skyline, and no objects were seen when the pictures were taken. According to the company processing the film, there was nothing inherently wrong with the film to cause the marking in question.

2. Mr. would like to have the enclosed negatives back in a reasonable length of time. This office would appreciate an estimate of what is showing on the film so that Mr. can be given some sort of statement upon its return.

1. Request that the attached two (2) frames of color transparencies be
reviewed for the purpose of specifically determining either the nature or the
cause of the spot appearing to be UFO's.

2. It is recommended that your report be as detailed and technical as
possible, so that there be no misunderstanding of our findings when officially
submitted to the Cambridge Research Center. The reason for this is that
are certain puzzling aspects regarding this matter.

a. It appears odd that a professional photographer would ask the
Air Force to identify what appears to be the result of emulsion, developing
or camera-equipment flaws.

b. M. I. T. has some of the finest equipment in the country for
photo analysis, which apparently was available to source.

c. The fact that the source feared ridicule is questioned, as is
the reason why he waited over two (2) years to submit the photos.

d. Previous experience with alleged UFO photography submitted by
professional photographers has resulted in some unfounded accusations against
the Air Force. (Ref UFAR-"SEA-GULL" Case.)

3. In keeping with USAF policy that all originals be returned to owners,
request two copies of the photos for UFO Case Files.

SUBJECT: Request for Analysis - UFO Photographs

TO: AFCIN-4BE    FROM: AFCIN-4A2f    DATE: 9 Apr 58 ; COMMENT NR. 2
                                      Ext 5-9193/Bldg 263/B-M

1. Due to recent transfer of photographic services responsibility, to AD, it is no longer possible to satisfy, request for additional copies of UFO prints or transparencies.

2. Analysis of attached transparencies is as follows:

    a. The black objects in transparencies appear-to-have-been created during processing, probably caused by air bubbles during first developer which prevented these areas from developing and then when re-exposed and developed, black images appeared during second developer.

    b. These images show no shape or gradation which would result in case of objects actually flying in the sky even if they were black.

8 x 10" print of photographs,
Boston, Massachusetts
? May 1956


- page 7 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be two similar black and white photographs of a waterfront or harbor scene with a city skyline in the background. The top and bottom images look nearly identical, with the bottom image showing what seems to be a boat or object on the water. The photographs are surrounded by a dark border.
