UNCLASSIFIED
32208a flying object sighting. 
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: Approximately 75-80 feet in diameter, round globular appearing object. It was a white color. The object was first observed to be hovering, but suddenly it started moving across the sky at a fairly fast rate of speed, at about 2000 to 2500 feet altitude. The object traveled in a straight line for about 3-4 miles and then suddenly disappeared. No smoke, trail or exhaust was visible. Original point where first observed was 2 miles N.E. of Johnson Bros. Farm. The object was under observation for about 30 to 45 seconds.
MANNER OF OBSERVATION: Visually from the ground. No optical or electronic equipment was used.
LOCATION OF OBSERVERS: The observers were located at 37Â°33'w - 77Â°10'n. Altitude 800 feet. The object was observed at a distance of 2 to 3 miles and headed in a northwesterly direction.
POSITION IN RELATION TO OTHER OBJECTS: No other objects were in the immediate vicinity.
WEATHER CONDITIONS: Sky clear, no cloud formations. Wind velocity 20 miles per hour from the southwest. Other weather conditions were normal.
RELATIONS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
INTERRUPTION OR IDENTIFICATION ACTION: None 
POSITION OF OBJECT IN RELATION TO AIRCRAFT: Two U.S. Air Force jet aircraft were noted to be some distance away in the northern part of the sky but they apparently did not see the object.
This is the report as submitted by this office.
CONTENTS OF PREPARING OFFICERS:
The signal was picked up at 1210 that cloud cover was absent and visibility was good. From 1225 to 1305 seven weather observers are employed in the tracking and checking of balloons released. Both observers are experienced personnel, having 7 to 10 years of experience in the types of objects which have been tracked and observed, it is the opinion of both observers that the maneuvers were much too abrupt for a

Lt. Col. Rector Quintanilla
4 June 1958

Should the files of Blue Book ever be thoroughly examined by competent scientists, this incorrect statistical procedure will stand out as being most unsatisfactory. Though more cumbersome, the proper thing to do is, of course, to carry in the statistical records the number of, let us say, aircraft, private airplanes, and possible aircraft cases as separate entries.

5. 12 June 1952, Wichita, Kansas. 

The past evaluation, "probably balloon" has a low priority since there is only a partial report. It was launched 10 minutes earlier in that general area, and there were two witnesses who have stated that the object entered the southeasst at a fast rate of speed. It was stated that the object remained almost motionless for 10 minutes, whereupon it stopped, made several maneuvers, reversed its field until it reached its original position, stopped and took off directly east at an estimated speed of 400 miles per hour. Observers stated that the object changed from globular form to elongated form as it was moving faster than sound.

(Circle One): Yes No
26.1 If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other cases?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
It is difficult to determine exactly what the object was from the information provided. The witness describes it as something unusual in the sky, but does not provide enough detail to conclusively determine the nature of the object. Without more specifics, it could have been any number of natural or man-made phenomena.

[Names and addresses redacted]

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional sheets if necessary.
After watching the object for a period of time I became convinced that I was not seeing any sort of conventional aircraft, as its movements and behavior were unlike anything I had ever observed before. It gave off no distinctive sound or exhaust, and was obviously under intelligent control. I cannot explain what I saw, but am certain that it was a phenomenonborderline the spectrum of our normal existence. I have told of this experience to only a few persons, as I realize how fantastic such an occurrence might seem to others. I nonetheless remain convinced that what I saw was real and that there is much to learn yet about the nature of the universe in which we live.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Reportedly Sighted over Omaha, 29 July 1952

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

1. GV-12P3192 Three (3) individuals reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object at approximately 2355 hours, 29 July 1952 at Omaha, Nebraska. 

2. Employees of United Air Lines (name(s) deleted) reported to this office that on 29 July 1952 at approximately 2355 hours, they observed a reddish-orange colored object, about one foot in diameter, traveling in a circular motion at a high rate of speed at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and then disappeared in a southeasterly direction. The employees stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft or astronomical phenomena and was not blinking or flashing. It was described as a steady, reddish-orange glow, traveling in a circular path.

3. It was added that the object remained in sight for about ten minutes, and that it is presumed the object had landed as it disappeared and did not reappear. The informants stated that her husband had also witnessed the object.

4. She stated that her husband had also been a witness to the same information as her information given.

5. Also reported to this office that he had sighted a round, disc-shaped object which disappeared in a southeasterly direction at approximately 2140 hours, 29 July 1952. He further stated that he had previously reported this, and that he was a former employee of the Omaha Air Force Base.

It was opined that the unidentified object may have been the spotlight, but that this was the only information he had been able to obtain.

T33's that were flying in the immediate vicinity of the observers. To have such apparent motion the official balloon would have to be considerable height, and even then could hardly have flown directly against a surface wind of 25 miles per hour.

Proper interrogation by competent persons at the time might have cleared up the situation. As it is, the only logical evaluation is "unidentified".

6. 12 June 1952, Ft. Smith, Arkansas. 

Agrees with present evaluation. "unidentified", and stated action as described can have a rational explanation if these were sun/moon reflections changing in the distance whose exact location, size, and altitude could not be determined at the time the jet might be brilliantly reflecting it. It would appear odd that a lieutenant colonel and a major both observing with binoculars for 10 to 15 minutes would not have identified a high-flying jet in that interval of time. There would have been very high flying jets in 1952? There would have been better better following up on this case also.

7. 13 June 1952, Middletown, Pennsylvania

I give this single-witness case a "23" C.I. The witness had the good sense to hold a pen up and judge the size of the object to the pen, and he knew that the object was larger by a factor of two, than the full. This means that the object was approximately twice the size of the pen at arm's length. This would indicate the object was of appreciable size. This could have been a balloon on its way down. No upward motion was detected, only downward and horizontal. Although the man had optical instruments, he did not see any structure or further details through the telescope. This means the object may well have been a distant shape or silhouette and probably much farther away than the man thought.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report, which describes a sighting of an unidentified object on June 19, 1952. The report provides details about the sighting, including the time, location, manner of observation, and the object's appearance and behavior. The report also mentions radar returns and possible light reflection or radar return from snow clouds in the area.

Text output from the document:

Goose Air Base, Labrador - 19 June 1952

At 0607z on 19 Jun 52 an object was sighted East of this base traveling from NE to SW. Manner of observation visual from the ground. The object was described by the 2141st Air Force as: "It was a red light, moving in a wobbly fashion, which turned white and disappeared." 

GCA was contacted and reported a target on their scope in the same area where the visual observation was made. Object appeared stationary on the scope at no more than a 2000' height due to the limitations of the radar. The blip would then return to its original size.

Solution: Possibly light reflection and radar return from snow clouds in the area.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
DATE OF INFORMATION: 29 June 1952
LOCATION: Near Tremonton, Utah
INFORMANT: Lt. Gorman, Captain USAF

The document describes a visual sighting of a UFO near Tremonton, Utah on June 29, 1952. It provides details about the object's appearance and behavior, as reported by the informant Lt. Gorman, Captain USAF. The document is classified as UNCLASSIFIED.

- page 53 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a written description of an observed object that the observer refers to as a "wire ball".

The text in the document is as follows:

DESCRIPTION: The object was "spherical" (an unusual shape) and had a third dimension. The size was about 4 the size of the moon in the field of view. The color was blue-white and the object was in the same field of view as the daylight fluorescent tubes. Only one object was observed. The object traversed about 15 degrees of arc and the sparks trailing from the object traversed about 10 degrees of arc parallel to the horizon. The observer described the object as first appearing as a "ball" and then becoming "like an exploded skyrocket" with sparks emanating from it before the sparks burned out and the object disappeared. The duration of the sighting was about 10-30 seconds.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

1. One bright, round, appearing, highly polished silver oval with a diameter of about 30 feet, first observed between two radio towers (WGN and WBKB) seven miles from observer. As the object disappeared to the southwest and then back north to the observer, the light continued brightly in the vertical direction. During the time the object passed overhead, the observer measured the object travelled to the southeast and then back north to the southwest, covering an arc of approximately 90 degrees in the vertical plane, the overall time of maneuver was about 2 to 3 minutes.
The object appeared to be much faster than any jet fighter. The observer could estimate the speed but could not state the exact speed of the object with certainty.
When the object slowed or stopped, a pulsating, or flashing light could be seen on the underside of the craft. The light was not connected to any motor or propulsion unit. The object was not accompanied by any sound. Observation time: 2 to 3 minutes
2. This object was observed on the 9 Jun 52 at approximately 11:00 PM. Length of observation - 2 to 3 minutes
3. S/Sgt Kastl, AF Tower Operator, Offutt AF Base, Neb. 
4. Estimate speed: Very fast, but could not estimate exact speed 
5. Estimate size: About 30 feet in diameter 
6. Position during observation: The object travelled in an arc of about 90 degrees in the vertical plane
7. The report stated that the object could not be identified by the observer as any known aircraft, weather phenomena, or astronomical object.

The image contains a drawing that appears to be a diagram related to the UFO report. The drawing shows mountains, a horizon, and an object labeled "observer" in the middle of the image.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: This phenomenon was witnessed by two other observers at the same location. The observers are familiar with astronomy and have studied the necessary data on accurate dates. 

VISUAL CONDITIONS: The sky was cloudless. There was a full moon. It was an ideal night for observing phenomena.

I would like to state that the object seen was not a balloon or any well-known astronomical object with the exception of a meteor. One of the observers with a telescope described the object as seen to increase in brightness. It then disappeared and I watched them fall and I did not remember a trail.

This is a drawing of the phenomenon.

The following is for your information and/or necessary action from the FOD and OD #1 for the period beginning 0330 25 July to 0330 31 July 1952:

2005 - Received a call from Springfield, Ohio from a project Springfield field employee who said he had seen some special 20 power ACK ACK glasses set up in his yard and his Operation Division (air base) had notified him that he was going to be investigated. He said he heard a noise got up and this was during the day and the two planes were traveling a two or three mile stream of fire and smoke. He was outside for about five minutes and the two planes were still there. (OD attempted to report this to GD 0100). 

2010 - A Sgt from Springfield, telephone number 25042 called to say that the Municipal Airport operator had called them and said there was two planes fooling around the field. (OD was still busy and the call was merely referred and not investigated on this matter).

2055 - Civilian operator at 0100 and reported the above to him. It was learned that the 97th Fighter had scrambled some of its planes and they were investigating the incident. Had checked operator and after making a survey had reported the above information to his office in the morning.

2355 - The Morning Star from Springfield called and requested information on what the jets discovered in their chase of the flying objects. They were told that no information could be released and suggest that they call 0100 for any additional details. When they informed this office that they had put their cameras on the objects since they were clear in Columbus and Columbus had taken their pictures over the objects.

(ATCC)			FROM: MAJOR		DATE 7/28/52	COMMENT NO. 1
1. On Wednesday evening, 23 July 1952, at 2015 hours, an unfamiliar object was noted in the sky at approximately a 15 degree angle from the vertical due south from South Charleston, West Virginia.
2. When first sighted, the object had the appearance of two white lights similar to a star, but much brighter. The object appeared to be approximately 1.5 to 2 miles high and 1/4 or 1/2 apart as viewed from the ground.
3. On the appearance of the aircraft, the object ascended vertically and became progressively smaller. The aircraft made a circle and came under the object again. As this time, the object was so distant as to be merged into the cloud formation. At approximately 20,000 and 40,000 feet, the object was estimated to be about 15 feet in diameter.
4. It was estimated that the object was again as high as the aircraft, approximately 20,000 to 40,000 feet. The aircraft would make a third pass, the object was so distant as to be merged into the clouds and became disappears.

THEN STATEMENTS AS I.E.  RE CAUGHT TO ATTENTION

Within is something that I should have told you as soon as I could recall the occurence. On 24 June 1952, just what I saw scared me so much that I hesitated to talk to anyone about it. I did talk it over with my brother whom I consider you here at the letter. Another reason for not mentioning it is because I'm having trouble with my wife in Californai, and I do not want any publicity that this strange experience so much to bother my sleep and so to day I decided to call you and get this taken care of.

In the afternoon of Thursday, 24 July, 1952, I was driving through Montana on the highway between the towns of Circle and Sidney, Montana. It was about 5:00 P.M. when I suddenly a unusual bright light. What I turned to observe it better I could see that it was not an aircraft as I first thought, but rather a round object which seemed to be hovering a coyote. The object soon disappeared and I drove on out across the open fields. By attention was then drawn to what appeared to be a water tank. I was in a car about 1 mile away and then I proceeded to walk toward it. As I approached I could see it was not a water tank and first got the impression it was a size of an automobile. I looked intently at this object, and I was struck by the fact that it seemed to be solid, but silvery in color and had portholes or windows around the top. There were 4 or 5 men standing around it by a fence. When I noticed two of the men who were at the base seemed to be examining something on the ground. Without attracting their attention I passed by walking to get nearer to this strange object. As I turned to get a better view the object took off straight up at a tremendous speed. The whole episode lasted on a total of about 15 minutes. After the object disappeared, I returned to my car and drove on. It was circular in shape, appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, and stood about 20 feet tall.

I am the corporal that was stationed near the town of Sidney in 1952, and this was much more interesting to me than in its outline silhouette. I was more interested in its mechanism than in its overall appearance. My curiosity was aroused by hearing two men who were bathing. I was given about 30 minutes to examine the object at close quarters. I was permitted to examine parts of this craft. This craft was not high enough off the ground for me to enter the craft myself. However I made a careful examination of the outer framework while the two men were not looking. I found the material was similar to natural metal, rather than a synthetic material, and it would not be dented but it was too heavy to lift the wheels by rocking. I endeavored to scratch the surface but it would not scratch. The outer skin was smooth and did not reflect light while the inside appeared to be polished metal and would reflect light, very bright light indeed. These things I examined under close supervision while the two men were preoccupied in their activity.

(CONT'D - PAGE 70 (2) OF ?)
EXHIBIT - VASES OF BRASS WITH SMALL ROLLERS
These vases were grooved on the outside end the grooves were made of brass with small rollers on the vanes which fitted into the grooves. The vanes were free and could be rotated on their own, but there was no evidence of a power source to spin the vanes. The vanes were three in number and were spaced uniformly around the circumference of the vases.
There was no sign of any electrical wiring at the hub of the vanes. I noted two holes on the outside of the side of the vases. These were such six-cylinder exposed type mounts, similar to what is used to mount a six-cylinder body on an airplane. There were four such mounts, one at each corner of the body near the upper strut area. The body had an aluminium saucer-shaped appearance on the lower side and was approximately thirty inches in diameter. This body had an overall height of about thirteen inches.
There were none visible the top part of the body protruded about 6 feet above the ground. The bottom part of the body projected about 6 feet above the ground. The projectile shaped dome above was partially obscured in a frame. The object was spherical in shape and tilted at a slight angle on opposite side of its axis.
On this ring on what appeared to be the front. I then noticed that one of the rings was broken and appeared to be unattached to the body on one side. It appeared to be highly excited and vibrated for the other ring was not moving.
I noticed that they had light blue uniforms and were dark boots, with no insignia on their uniforms. As they approached I in no direction retreated some distance began on the hill.
Glanced through the vanes strike away into the body proper and also immediately the object started to rise rapidly disappearing into the night. I notice that it traveled at a much higher rate disappearing quickly.
While I was standing underneath the object I noticed an odor which imparted me as an underwriter might call "paraffin". This odor was much to sharper and stronger than one which I have constantly smelled.
I did not notice that the three vanes left an imprint in the sand where the ground and found part of a stamp watch wears, but when inspected later in the day I could find no evidence have ever seen.
REMARKS:
This was directly to the south on a distant hill from where I was standing but when I looked for it later on it was gone. I then passed off the distance for the size of the object must have been about 200 grams.
I regret that I did not think to get my camera out of the car so that I could have taken some photographs.
I have great difficulty in the hearing in my left ear is impaired.
I believe that I could make an almost exact model of this object and plan to do this as soon as I can find time and settie down.
I CERTIFY THIS TO BE FACTS RECORDED AS I ALLEGED A FIRST-HAND WITNESS TO ALL DETAILS

STATEMENT

I was called from my hotel room early Wednesday morning, 30 July (approximately Central Standard time 0035) by Lt. Albright. He stated that he had just interviewed a man who said he had seen a flying object take off but had examined it on the ground. He asked that I join him at the Office Center to hear the man's immediate statement, which I did. 

While being unaccountable in my replies I made the following observations:

Mr. --- is a man of middle age, of medium height, dark brown hair and has a very deliberate conversation and voice with a slight German accent. He seemed excited in his conversation and spoke with a great deal of sincerity. He did reiterate the fact that he had seen the object take off and its disappearance. He told me that his wife was with him and did not want her to know where he was now. He was concerned regarding his identity and the possibility of his wife finding out. He said that he had no reason for telling anything but the truth, and only wanted to get the subject off his mind.

I followed through on the interrogation made by Lt. Albright and the Operations Officer of the 138th AC&W Squadron who gathered the information by phone (as the man was reluctant to come to the office). They prepared a detailed description of the object. He never wavered in his story and the following items did weaken my belief in his story:

a. The fact that he had waited a week before disclosing the story.
b. Why would he mention that he had a camera in his car and not think to use it?
c. The loss of the stamp that he thought came from the cigarette package.
d. His story about his wife and his reluctance for any publicity.

Statement ( Col John A.F. Miller (conta) ( UNCLASSIFIED
The attached letter came to this office Indicating about this subject. He stated that he had not and was as sceptic as most people of the existence of flying saucers. Our investigation was completed about 4:30 A.M. At that time we did have his sign a single statement that Lt. Although had signed, to the effect that the noise taken were true and accurate.
I took him to my hotel room after we had joined up at the service station at Williston. He admitted to me at that time that he was in the hotel until 7:00 A.M. and then returned to the Trailer Center.
I had him describe the object and give me dimensions as I attempted to measure it. Again, I was impressed with the details that he remembered and wondered if he was a fabrication of his own mind. It is felt, however, that individuals combined on certain aspects except for the dimensions, do not have characteristics generally reported. The propelled platform that might have the characteristics reported by
this witness appears onoother.

Mr. ---------- was quite concerned in getting off the monthly payment on his car and to a question asked, he was backing or paying on the car in question here at Williston. When I arrived he stated that he might be getting a job at Williston, N. Dak. which is approximately 200 miles from home. He did state he did not do. He wanted to get him to read and sign the initial statement which I have counselled for him from the note and his discussion of the subject.

In the interest of this I am forwarding them with out my signature that appears only on one page of the notes.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (ORGANIZATION) ATCH AGAW SQ., CARSWELL, V/SO.
REPORT NO: 229

1. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS:

Multiple sightings of unidentified flying objects were observed on 28 and 29 June 1952. The objects gave the appearance of being normal aircraft due to the altitude and speeds involved but the significant clues constituting the sightings were the irregular patterns of flight, maneuvers of an erratic nature, and periods of static hovering aloft. There was no trail or vapor trail as the objects executed the observed maneuvers. There was the elimination of one sighting period when apparently the objects disappeared and reappeared at another point. There was a total of 12 sightings on 28 June and 7 sightings on 29 June 1952.

2. TYPE OF SIGHTINGS:
Electronic sightings: Signals were recorded between 2552'25" and 22'55" Z.
Usual sightings: All visual sightings covered by this report occurred between 2303'30" and 2322'00" Z.

3. MANNER OF SIGHTINGS:
A. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Sightings were made by Ground Electronic Equipment, Type of Radar: AN/CPS-5, Range: 25-30 miles, Antenna Tilt: two (2) degrees. All antenna tilt was low and limited the range. Detections were intermittent and function was satisfactory.
B. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: All visual sightings covered by this report were made from the ground by naked eye.

1. LOCATION:
VISUAL SIGHTINGS: Location of sighting station is 15/15N-99/25/E.

2. CELESTIAL BODIES AND NAVIGATION:
What visual sightings? The objects would visually appear on the radar scope on the higher azimuths and this would indicate that they were beyond the limit of the equipment.

3. IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION:
VISUAL SIGHTINGS: All visual sightings covered by this report were made from Carswell AFB, Texas, on 15/15N-99/25/E. Details on these sightings are provided.

4. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS:
VISULAL SIGHTINGS: Several sightings were observed from this station on this date. It was not possible to identify the targets as to being conventional aircraft or unknowns. The sightings seemed to behave erratically and to exhibit high rates of speed. They were beyond the limit of the equipment. Almost immediately after plotting the position of the objects, they would disappear from the radar scope.

5. WEATHER INFORMATION AND OBSERVERS:
OBSERVERS: DOMENICK BARBARO J. AFSC 1310 2Lt, USAF
PILOT: JOHN L. FULK AFSC 1445A, USAF
NAVIGATOR: GORDON R. MCKENZIE AFSC 1135, USAF

6. LOCATION AT TIME OF SIGHTINGS:
The sighting station was located in an area of extensive electronic countermeasures training being conducted during this entire period of time. Minds were distracted.

7. CONCLUSIONS ACCORDING TO OBSERVERS:
a. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Nothing that has not been stated.
b. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: Nothing that has not been stated.

8. REMARKS:
ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Photographs of the radar scope showing 4 or 5 individual targets that could not be identified as conventional aircraft.

25 July 1952, Osceola, Wisconsin
Reports on photos marked Inclosure "Point #1" are considered to be from sighting of object on 25 July 1952 in the vicinity of Osceola, Wisconsin. Indications are that this interference radar is located in a direct line with the object sighted, and could have caused an interference to the radar set in this location. The data obtained from the radar site indicate the distance to the object and course of the object.
Whether data would be useful in determining if some distant (200 plus or minus) miles must have caused the interference. The data recorded are:
a. Temperature vs height
b. Moisture vs height
c. Cloud conditions.

As the man came towards them, he appeared to be dazzling them. He had what looked like a book in his hands. At one point, it flickered, and then suddenly vanished. The man continued walking towards them, and then disappeared completely. They looked around but could see no sign of him. The whole incident lasted approximately 2-3 minutes.

THE OBJECT AS OBSERVED WAS SHAPED LIKE A BROAD TRIANGLE AND WAS OF A FLAMING OR INCANDESCENT COLOR. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR 10 TO 15 SECONDS AND THEN APPEARED TO SPLIT INTO 3 SEPARATE OBJECTS WHICH FLEW AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IN AN ARC-STATIC ABOUT. OVER THE NOISE BOOM AND EXTREME VELOCITY OF THE OBJECTS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT ANY SOUND COMING FROM THEM. ON SOME OCCASIONS IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE OBJECTS WERE TRAVELING IN EXCESS OF 1000 MILES PER HOUR AND THAT THEY WERE HIGHLY MANEUVERABLE. THEIR COURSE AND SPEED WERE ERRATIC AND GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL.
