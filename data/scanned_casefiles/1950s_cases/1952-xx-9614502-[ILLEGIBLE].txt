SUMMARY: On 12 June, 1952, the source of this report, was standing at the passenger entrance gate south of the Municipal Airport Terminal, at 1610. He was waiting for a schedule/airline which was then overdue. He noticed in the East a round white object hovering in the sky. The object was stationary at a constant position for 10-15 seconds, then moved at a fast rate of speed. The object stopped, made several maneuvers and reversed its field until it reached its original position, stopped and took off at a calculated speed of 400 miles per hour. At this time the object appeared to change from a cylindrical to a round shape. He was not discernible, but that the object appeared to glint like metal. He describes numerous maneuvers and says that the object was moving faster than T-33's flying in the immediate vicinity of the observer.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: 6ythth AGW Sq., Osceola, Wis.                    REPORT NO.    2-52
                                                        PAGE 1 OF 3 PAGES

1. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS:

    a. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Numerous unidentified flying objects of undetermined size on 25 July 1952 by members of the 6ythth AGW Squadron, Osceola, Wisconsin, who were on an active air defense mission in the northern half of the state. Since of the units which could establish the position of some sightings which occurred as an arc (reference 1a arc to the 90 and 270 degree radials) would appear and add on the radar scope as a conclusion that some part of the arc extending and fading before another point. There was no indication of ground contact from these objects. Some were tracked from 20,000 hours to approximately on the radar scope sat on the 270 radial all evening. A preliminary interpretation of these sightings as possible electronic countermeasures (ECM) was made because of their speed. Targeted squadron on the calder area followed a normal pattern of a clockwise cycle. One (1) cycle was approximately two (2) minutes and forty-five (45) seconds. The correlation placed back by use of sightings. There is some art of the heavy sporadic sightings in the northern half of the radar scope of the state. Some correlation between these electronic sightings and visual sightings made by pilots of the 129th Ftr. Sq. (ANG), Minneapolis, Minnesota, were also assembled by the 6ythth AGW Squadron at the coordination level. This correlation placed back by use of sightings.

    b. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: Numerous visual sightings were observed in the early morning of 25 July 1952 by members of the 6ythth AGW Squadron. Osceola, Wisconsin. Sightings were made from various locations: lowish flashes, each lasting approximately one (1) second with times (3) to six (6) seconds. Apparent location was in the sky. One (1) sighting was of two (2) similar flashes in a small area. This was the only indication of any possible formation noted. Line of sight was determined to be from ground observers to the western horizon & 5th of the site of the 6ythth AGW Squadron, at which point it was lost.

2. TIME OF SIGHTINGS:
    a. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Sightings occurred between 2330125 and 2336125 lasting one (1) hour and twenty-three (23) minutes.

    b. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: All visual sightings occurred between 2330125 and 2336125 lasting five (5) minutes.

3. MANNER OF SIGHTINGS:
    a. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Sightings were made by Ground Electronic Tracking Type of equipment—APA/GSA-52; Operating Frequency—2900 Mcs to 2950 Mcs; PPI—Sz; MTI—Will Antenna Tilt—(2) Scope Size (3) Azimuth Antenna & Slant Range (0) decrease. All radar characteristics performed properly.

    b. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: All visual sightings covered by this report were made by ground observers.

Description of Object: Color white round globular appearing object. Diameter approximately 30 feet. Object hovered for about a period of 10 or 15 seconds.
Suddenly object moved across the sky at a fairly fast rate of speed in a southwesterly direction. It stopped suddenly, hovered for a moment, then went into a series of maneuvers, gained altitude, flashed down, and then flow back into its original point where first sighted. No noise, swirls, or exhaust were apparent to the observer. Impression of speed 400 miles per hour or faster. Altitude 500 feet. Distance two to three miles.

Time of Sighting: Object sighted at 1610. Entire observation took about 30 to 40 seconds.

Manner of Observation: Visually from the ground. No optical or electronic equipment used.

Location of Observation: The observers were located at 37°33'N - 97°16'W. Altitude of point approximately 500 feet, distance 2 to 3 miles and headed in a southeasterly direction.

Identifying Information of Observer: One of the observers is associated with the Beech Aircraft Corporation, in the Trading Department. The second observer is the Bell Aircraft Corporation's Resident Representative at the Boeing Airplane Company, Wichita, Kansas.

Atmospheric Conditions: Sky clear, no cloud formations, wind velocity 25 miles per hour from southwest (observer checked this by car radio which was close at hand)

Meteorological Conditions: None

Evidence of Physical Evidence: None

Interception or Identification Action Taken: None

Location of Air Traffic in General Area: Two T-33 aircraft were noted by the observers, one flying north, and another some distance away in the northern part of the sky, but neither near the object.

This report was not sent by electrical means since too much time had elapsed between the sighting and the receipt of this report by this office.

Comments of Preparing Officer:

The local West Air Bureau reported at 1612 that cloud cover was scattered with tops at 16,000 feet, wind SSW at 24 knots with gusts to 29 knots; altitude 0777, temperature 91°, dew point 70. Both observers are employed in the aircraft industry. It seems probable that they did see some airborne object which behaved erratically, but which could have been a T-33 penetrating aerobatic, although it is the opinion of both observers that the maneuvers were much too abrupt for a T-33.

competent scientists, this documentary procedure will
qu-'y be pointed out as being most unscientific. Though more
cu..ursome, the proper thing to do is, of course, to carry in
the statistical record the number of, let us say, aircraft,
pro'able aircraft, and possible aircraft cases as separate entries.

4.    5 June 1952, Lubbock, Texas.

Properly classed as unknown. It would be straining things
to call these possible aircraft. In view of the experience and
reliability of both observers, I feel, however, much more information could have been extracted from the original observers. For
instance, what did they mean by "lights appeared to be spherical
and six inches in diameter"? They estimated the objects to be
40,000 feet high. Did they mean six inches at arm's length, etc?
Very obvious information bits have been repeatedly overlooked in
these cases. It is obviously too late to go back for this information in 1952 cases, etc., but in view of the continued interest
in the UFO phenomenon in this and other countries, it behooves us
to correct the mistakes of the past in the investigation of the
truly puzzling cases of the present. The great handicap that
Project Blue Book works under arises not only from lack of staff
in Dayton, but from more important, in the gross lack of support
at the originating airbases. Also, what is meant by "two objects
were approximately 100 yards apart"? At 40,000 feet, this would
mean a subtended angle of approximately one-half degree. Things
like this could have been checked out by an intelligent interrogator or officer.

5.    12 June 1952, Wichita, Kansas.

To 06. The past evaluation, "probably balloon" has a low
probability, even though a piball was reportedly launched 10
minutes earlier in that general area. There were two witnesses
and it is the wind 25 miles per hour from the northwest it is
unlikely that a balloon could perform the maneuvers as reported.
It was stated that the object remained almost motionless for 10
to 15 seconds then moved southwest at a fast rate (against the
wind) whereupon it stopped, made several maneuvers, reversed
its field until it reached its original position, stopped and
took off if directly east at an estimated speed of 400 miles per
hour, at which time the object changed from globular to saucer-
shaped. Observers stated that the object was moving faster than

ATTN: Chief, Counter Intelligence Five

1. SYNOPSIS: Three (3) individuals reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object at approximately 2130-2140 hours, 28 July 1952, at Omaha, Nebraska.

2. DETAILS: Mrs. [redacted], Omaha, Nebr. (employee of Offutt AFB, Nebr.) reported to this office that on 28 July 1952, at approximately 2130 hours, she sighted a round, disc-like object, about two to three inches in diameter, with a yellow-orange glow, traveling in a circular pattern, at various speeds, in the sky. Mrs. advised that she was able to distinguish the object from a spotlight traversing the sky in a similar pattern, inasmuch as the spotlight was white-silver light, while the unknown object emitted a yellow-orange light. Mrs. added that the object remained in sight for about ten minutes, at which time in traveled in a northwesterly direction and disappeared.

Her [redacted] furnished substantially the same information as his wife, except that he believed a dark object had also been in the area when she first observed the object. He opined that the dark object may have been used to divert attention from the light.

Mr. [redacted], Omaha, Nebr., also reported to this office that he had sighted a round, disc-shaped object, with a yellow glow, travel in a circular pattern in the sky and disappear in a southeasterly direction at approximately 2140 hours, 28 July 1952. However, Mr. [redacted] later reported that at a later observation he had seen a spotlight in the sky with rays from the ground, but that he obtained the unidentified object again from the spotlight, but that the rays had not been visible at his first sighting.

T33's that were flying in the immediate vicinity of the observers.
To have such apparent motion the piball balloon would have to be
very close by, at which time it would have been recognized as such,
and even then could hardly have flown directly against a surface
wind of 25 miles per hour.

Proper interrogation by competent persons at the time might
have cleared up the situation. As it is, the only logical evalua-
tion is "unidentified".

6.    12 June 1952, Ft. Smith, Arkansas.

I agree with present evaluation, "unidentified", and classed
as E3, G7. Sighting can have a rational explanation if there were
extremely high-flying jets in 1952. Observation took place near
sundown at which time the jet might be brilliantly reflecting
sunlight and the control 11 likewise. It would appear odd that a
lieutenant colonel and a major both appear with binoculars for
10 to 15 minutes would not have identified a high-flying jet in
that interval of time. Were there very high flying jets in 1952?
There would have been better followup in this case also.

7.    13 June 1952, Middletown, Pennsylvania

I give this single-witness case a E3, C4. The witness had the
good sense to hold a penny out at arm's length to judge the size
and noted that it was slightly smaller than the penny. This means
that the object was larger by about a factor of two, then the full
moon.

This could have been a balloon on its way down. No upward motion
was detected only downward and horizontal. Although the man had
experience as a control tower operator, his statement that he has
"some knowledge of astrology" and that he thought it was an exploded
star does not rate him high in my book as a competent witness. I
believe insufficient information would be a better classification
than unknown in this case.

Goose Air Base, Labrador - 19 June 1952

At 06072 on 19 Jun 52 an object was sighted East of this base traveling from NE to SE. Manner of observation visual from the ground. The object was described by the Air Force 2/Lt who observed it as "a red light", moving in a wobbly fashion, which turned white and disappeared.

GCA was contacted and reported a target on their scope in the same area where the visual observation was made. Object appeared stationary on the scope at no more than 4000' height due to the limitation of the radar set. The blip would enlarge momentarily then return to its original size.

Solution: Possibly light reflection and radar return from snow clouds in the area.

DR. [name redacted]
OPTOMETRIST
4768 SOUTH STATE
MURRAY, UTAH

June 11, 1952

These are my observations of an object that I would call a "fire ball".

DESCRIPTION: The shape was spherical (I am assuming that it had a third dimension). The size was about ± the size of the moon(the moon and the object were in the same field of view). The color was blue white, self luminous. (About the color of a daylight fluorescent tube). There was only one object. It left no visible trail. It made no sound. The speed can be estimated from the following data: the object traversed about 15° of arc in 2 to 3 seconds. The traveled a slight arc from West to East, about parallel to the horizon.

The disappearance of the object was as follows: The object was intensely bright and fell of a sudden the brightness ceased (no explosion) and what appeared to be sparks (few) seemed to float down from the object. These sparks burned out before reaching the ground.

TIME OF SIGHTING: It was about 10:00 P.M. The length of time observed was about 2 to 3 seconds.

MANNER OF OBSERVATION: The object was viewed with the naked eye from the ground.

LOCATION OF OBSERVER: I was standing at 5520 Montrose, Murray, Utah. The location of the object was as follows: Then I first saw the object it was directly South at about the same altitude as the moon. It traveled in a slight arc from West to East (distance traveled about 15 degrees of arc). Its flight ended about 7 degrees "west of the moon" and about 7 degrees below the moon. I can only guess at the distance from me to the object, but because of its size, brightness and the manner in which the sparks fell, I would say that it was relatively close.

REPORTED BY: Edgar C. Hanford, 1st Lt. USAF
SOURCE: Three Air Police on duty at O'Hare Int. Aprt.

SUMMARY:
One oval object, described as being very bright, smooth, highly polished silver in color with a definite blue base surrounding it for the first 25 - 30 minutes of sighting was observed from O'Hare Airport. Size estimated at 30 feet at 7 miles distance. Object moved at a very high rate of speed and disappeared "like shutting off a light".

Two scientists consulted at Adler Planetarium, Chicago stated that object could not have been caused by temperature inversion.

1. One bright, smooth appearing, highly polished silver oval with an estimated diameter of 20 feet was observed at estimated altitude of from 500 to 1000 feet and first appeared between two radio towers (WGN and WBBM) some miles from observers.

At first sighting the object appeared stationary and appeared to be over the towers.

During the next 15 minutes the object traveled to the southeast and then back north to approximately 1/2 mile from original point. Its movement was in some extent in the vertical plane. Its acceleration during these movements was practically instantaneous to a speed which seemed to be much faster than any jet fighter. At same time object moved slowly and making what seemed to be a long longitudinal peel. Then the object rocked or turned into a vertical plane its shape was easily discernible.

The object was first sighted by S/Sgt Kowalski (radar first sighting). Object was not accompanied by any noise. The observation was made without any optical aids.

Observers were: SSgt Lopez
                 1/Lt Weber
                 S/Sgt Kowalski (made first sighting)
                 Sgt Sandora (Air Police Det)
                 O'Hara (intel) Airport, Park Ridge, Ill.

Above named are familiar with jet aircraft and state definitely that this object sighted was not of a type known to them.

MURRAY, UTAH

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: This phenomenon was witnessed by two other observers at the same location as myself. They are [ILLEGIBLE]
Murray, Utah. I feel that my observations are fairly reliable, because I have studied and am interested in astronomy. I am a college graduate and familiar with the necessity of accurate data.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: The sky was cloudless. There was a full moon. It was an ideal night for observation of such a phenomena.

I would like to state that the object seen was not a meteor. I am well acquainted with the appearance of a meteor.

One of the observers, Keith Norsgren described the phenomena as follows: "As I watched the object it seemed to increase in brightness. It was the same color as a star shell. It was about 1/2 the size of the moon, then the brightness disappeared sparks seemed to fall and I watched them as they fell. I don't remember a tail.

This is a drawing of the phenomena.

The following is for your information and/or necessary action from the report of the POD and OD #1 for the period beginning 0630 23 July to 0630 24 July 1952.

2005 - Received a call from Springfield, Ohio from a field employee with a field phone number. He lives in the east end of Springfield. He has some special 20 power AGC glasses set up in his yard and he observed three dots in the air just a few minutes ago. He said, He looked through the glasses and southeast of the three dots was another dot of Amber shade. The amber dot was trailing a two or three mile stream of fire and smoke. In five minutes the Amber dot and stream of fire was gone (but the dots are still there). This is all directly southeast of the east end of Springfield. (OD attempted to report this to G1100 but line was busy at this time.)

2010 - A Sgt. from Springfield, telephone number 25049 called to say that due east of the Municipal Airport of Springfield there is something strange in the sky and that there were two planes flying around it. (G1100 was still busy and the field operator said the Flying Objects Project Office of ATIC was swamped with calls on this matter.)

2015 - Finally contacted Maj Whedon at G1100 and reported the above to him. It was learned that the 97th Fighter had scrambled some of its planes and they were investigating. The incident. Maj Whedon requested that the above information be forwarded to his office in the morning.

2055 - Major from Base Comptrollers Office, called in to report that while he was at the scout camp near Yellow Springs, Ohio that at almost dark, he witnessed three lights that were pretty high above the Springfield Municipal Airport and that he had field glasses and thin hand got a pretty cool look at them. The lights appeared to be joined together and were in a vertical position rather than a horizontal line. He said that there was two jets there that appeared to be investigating but that the lights appeared to get higher and move away from the jets.

2215 - The Morning Star from Springfield called and requested information about what the jets discovered in their chase of the Flying Objects. They were told that no information could be released and suggested to them that they call G1100 for any releasable details. Then they informed this office that television station WTVN in Columbus had put their cameras on the objects since they were clear in Columbus and transmitted then over television to their viewing audience.

TEEN SIGHTINGS BY MR. [REDACTED] RE CALLING TO INCIDENT

"While is something that I should have told you as soon as I could after it occurred on 24 July 1952, but what I now scared me so much that I hesitated to talk to anyone about it. I did talk it over with my brother who advised me to contact you here at the Filter Center. Another reason for not mentioning it is because I'm having trouble with my wife in California and I do not want any publicity that would get to her and let her know where I am. I kept thinking about this strange experience so much it bothered my sleep and so today I decided to call you and get this appointment."

In the afternoon of Thursday, 24 July 1952, I was driving through Montana on the highway between the towns of Circle and Glendive, Montana. It was about 8:00 P.M., Mountain Standard Time, when I turned off the road north from Lindsey, Montana to try my luck with my rifle in shooting a coyote. "The road soon disappeared and I drove on out across the open fields towards some hills. My attention was first drawn to what appeared to be a water tank. I was in a ravine about a mile away and I proceeded on foot with my rifle in hand. As I approached I could see it was not a water tank and first got the impression it was a rocket like the type used to advertise the Oldsmobile Automobile. I climbed a little hill and my attention was then drawn to a group of horses who were milling around by a lake. Then I noticed two men who were swimming or bathing and that was what the horses seemed to be curious about. Without anything further to add, I got to the object I first sighted and was surprised to find that it was of an extraordinary nature and shape. - I was amazed at the type and workmanship. Thus, 15 to 20 paces, which was circular, in diameter with the strut bracing and central body giving it the appearance of a big toy top. The stem extending upwards was about 5 feet square and 8 feet tall. I estimated the overall diameter of the object to be about 36 feet and it stood about 20 feet tall.

I am a private pilot and am skilled as an automotive mechanic and body worker. My curiosity overcame my fear and by keeping in sight the two men who were bathing, I was given about 50 minutes to examine the structure of the object. I was painted light blue all over and I managed to scrape some of this paint off with my car keys and found the metal underneath was of a very tough alloy. The seams were either welded or crimped as no rivets were used. I tried shaking the structure and it would rock but it was too heavy to lift the wheels by rocking. There were 16 propeller vanes extending from the body to the circumference of the disc inside the craft-braced frame. These vanes were

supported by bands and the grooved circumference rings. They were made of brass with small rollers on the vanes which fitted into grooves.

There was no gearing evidence to attach these vanes to the motor but they seemed to be driven by the electrical impulse which was indicated by the presence of electrical wiring at the hub of the vanes. I noted two large engines on opposite sides of the body through louvers. They were each six cylinder exposed type without cover and to be a large generator at their base. There were also three large tubes that came out of the body near the upper strut area and projected down close to the ground.

They had a diameter of approximately 14 inches. I observed all parts closely for numbers and letters that might identify them but none were visible. The top part of the body projected about 8 feet above the top strut frame and had a projected shell around the square body half way up. The projectile shaped dome above was partly enclosed in glass.

There was a series of seven control fins attached on opposite sides of the diameter frame which supported the rotor vanes. Also 5 control fins on this ring on what appeared to be the front. I then noticed that one of the men left the water and appeared to pick up an object by his clothing. He expanded to be big(?) and motioned to the other man out of the water. They hurriedly dressed and at my distance I noticed they had light blue uniforms and wore dark boots with no headgear. They were both tall men, one with light hair and the other with dark hair. I couldn't hear well enough to determine their language. As they approached in my direction I retreated some distance back over the hill. They climbed through the vane strut area into the body proper and almost immediately the object started to rise vertically for about 100 feet. It then leveled off and gained speed, rapidly disappearing from my sight. I did notice that as it leveled off the bulleted shaped nose receded slightly backwards into the strut structure. There was quite a bit of whirring and grinding noise as it took off. An odor was prevalent in the air which reminded me of an undertaking parlor. This caused my mouth to water and I was constantly spitting. I did notice that two of the tires left an imprint where it stood on the ground. I walked down to where the two men had been bathing and found part of a stamp which seemed to have come from a cigarette package. This stamp was different from any I have ever seen. I picked it up and placed it in my side coat pocket but when I looked for it later or in it was gone. I then paced off the distance from the edge of the lake to where the object was grounded and found it to be about 300 steps.

I regret that I did not think to get my camera out of the car so that I could have taken some shots.

I have good eyesight but the hearing in my left ear is impaired.

I believe that I could make an almost exact model of this object and plan to do this as soon as I can find a job and settle down.

I CERTIFY THIS TO BE NOTES RECORDED AS I DETAILED A TRUE EXPERIENCE TO AIR FORCE PERSONNEL AND UNDER FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PENALTY INVOLVED IN FOUND TO BE UNTRUE.

S T A T E M E N T

I was called from my Hotel room early Wednesday morning, 30 July (Approximately Central Standard Time 0035) by Lt. Albright. He stated that he was interviewing a man who not only had seen a flying object but had examined it on the ground. He asked that I join him at the Filter Center to hear the man's fantastic tale. When I arrived at the Filter Center the man immediately engaged me in conversation. While being nonchalant in my replies I made the following observations:

Mr. [REDACTED] is a man of middle age, of medium height, dark brown hair and had a deep sunburned complexion. He was more nervous than excited in his conversation and spoke with a slight German accent. He answered in German when I queried him in this language. He said that he had recently left a good job in California to get away from his wife and did not want her to know where he was now. He was mentioned regarding the penalty of falsifying on official statements. He didn't display fear in this respect and stated that he had no reason for telling anything but the truth, that he did not except anything out of it, and only wanted to get the subject off of his mind and to the proper authorities.

I observed that his left index finger was missing and that the hearing of his left ear was impaired due to an explosion.

I followed through on the interrogation made by Lt. Albright and the Operations Officer of the 136th AG & J Squadron who gathered the information by phone for the telegraph report of this nature required by regulations. I was impressed through out the period with his memory and detailed description of the object. He never wavered or changed his story on any part of the subject. The following items did weaken my belief in his story:

a. The fact that he had waited a week before disclosing the story.

b. Why would he mention that he had a camera in his car and not think to use it?

c. The loss of the stamp that he thought came from the crew's cigarette package.

d. His story about his wife and his reluctance for any publicity.

Statement | Col John A.H. Miller (contd) | UNCLASSIFIED

I asked him if he had ever read or studied about this subject. 
He stated that he had not and was as skeptic as most people of the existence of flying saucers. The interrogation was completed about 1:30 A.M. At that time we did have him sign a simple statement that Lt. Albright had typed, to the effect that the notes taken were true.

I took him to my hotel room after we had parked his car in a garage.
I instructed Lt. Albright to contact the local P.D. to have them keep check on the man. We rested at the hotel until 7:00 A.M. and then returned to the Filter Center.

I had him describe the object and give me dimensions as I attempted to slotch it. Again I was impressed with the details that he remembered and wondered if it was a fabrication of his own mind.
I do feel that regardless of whether he saw or dreamt up this gadget, it has possibilities as a combined autogyro and either jet or rocket propelled platform that might have the characteristics reported by flying saucer observers.

Mr. [REDACTED] was quite concerned in getting off the monthly payment on his car to a California agent. He also was looking for a job. He departed here at 10:00 A.M. but made two phone calls, at my request from Monday, which is last call, he stated that he at 8 P.M. this he did not do. I wanted to get him to read and sign the inclosed statements which I have compiled for him from the note and his discussion of the subject.

In the interest of time I am forwarding them with out his signature that appears only on one page of the notes.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency)                                  REPORT NO.
617th ACAW Sq., Osceola, Wisc.                 24-52        PAGE 1 OF 3 PAGES

1. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS:
    a. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Numerous unidentified flying objects of undetermined size or shape were sighted by Ground Electronic means in the early morning of
    25 July 1952, by members of the 617th ACAW (Aircraft Control & Warning) Squadron, Osceola, Wisconsin, then on duty. Some of the types which constituted the sightings were normal with the
    exception of some sightings which appeared to be an error (reference made to "no apparent" tracks). Area well appears and fade on the radar scope as a complete unit to be on
    part of the area reappearing and fading before another part. There was no indication of any original formation noted during the sightings. Speed varied between 140,100 and
    20,000 knots as computed on the radar scope set on the 200 nautical mile range. Patterns of sightings or disappearance on reaching the extreme range of the equipment or, at the being
    palated once or twice, failed to reappear. Altitude of targets could not be computed because of their speed. Target appearance on the radar scope followed a general pat-
    tern of a clockwise cycle, running southeast then westerly, and finally north easterly.
    One (1) cycle was approximately two (2) minutes and forty-five (45) seconds for completion. There was an average delay of one (1) minute between cycles. This
    procedure was repeated over and over again during the entire sighting period. Toward the end of the sightings it was extremely difficult to pick out any one (1) cycle thus
    to the heavy dependence of sightings in the northern half of the radar scope. And the last learning of the defined sightings in the southern half of the radar scope. There was
    some correlation between these electronic sightings and visual sightings as detailed by pilots of the 109th Fighter Squadron, Vold-Chamberlain Field, Minneapolis, Minnesota, who
    were scrambled by the 617th ACAW Squadron in conjunction with the radar sightings.

    b. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: Numerous unidentified moving lights were visually observed in the early morning of 25 July 1952, by members of the 67th ACAW Squadron,
    Osceola, Wisconsin, who were then on duty. The lights observed were very short, relatively six (6) seconds elapsing between flashes. The flashes moved very rapidly across the
    sky (One (1) sighting was of two (2) similar flashes in parallel movement which was the only indication of any possible formation noted. Size and speed were not
    determined due to lack of comparison with known objects. Lights appeared from the eastern horizon to the western horizon south of the site of the 617th ACAW Squadron,
    at that was judged to be twenty (20) degrees above the horizon.

2. TIME OF SIGHTINGS:
    a. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Sightings occurred between 2501228 and 2502188 lasting one (1) hour and twenty-three (23) minutes.

    b. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: All visual sightings covered by this report occurred between 2501308 and 2502008 lasting thirty (30) minutes.

3. MANNER OF SIGHTINGS:
    a. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Sightings were made by Ground Electronic Equipment, Type of equipment AN/CPS-4B, Operating Frequency 2965 Kcs to 2980 Kcs; PRF-300 PSS;
    Antenna RHW-64 MTI-411; Antenna TIL-Two (2) point five (5) degrees; Antenna Slant
    —eight (8) degrees. All meter reading were normal and equipment was functioning
    properly.

    b. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: All visual sightings, covered by this report, were made from the ground by naked eye.

4.    LOCATION:
      a. ELECTRONIC SIGHTINGS: Location of sighting station is 15/15N-92/28/5.4W.
      Targets would periodically appear on the radar scope on the 130th Altitude (approximately
      seventy (70) nautical miles out from sighting station and, remaining in the vicinity
      of this azimuth, would proceed at a great speed away from the sighting station until
      they went beyond the limit of the equipment. Almost immediately targets would appear
      in an unreadable position, possibly 100 nautical miles south of sighting station and
      proceed in a westerly direction at great speed until running beyond the limit of the
      equipment (reference is made to Ins #4, this report). Again, targets would immedi-
      ately appear, this time north of sighting station and, following no particular pat-
      tern, would point once or twice in an easterly direction and disappear.

      b. VISUAL SIGHTINGS: All visual sightings, covered by this report, were
      made from the ground at (15/15N-92/28/5.4W). Lights observed traveled from east to
      west an unknown distance south of this position. Lights were judged to be twenty(20)
      degrees above the horizon.

25 July 1952, Osceola, Wisconsin

Targets on photos marked Enclosure "Point #2" are considered to be due to interference from another radar set operating very near the same frequencies, plus reproduction rate and antenna rotation speed at the same site at Osceola. Indications are that this interfering radar is located in a Southwest direction from the Osceola site. In so considering possible that the AW/CPS-4 located at Elkhorn, Wisconsin, could have caused interference once to the radar set located near Osceola.

The periodic appearance of the targets in rotation speed of the two radar antennas - interference occurred when the two antennas were pointing towards each other.

Targets on photos marked Enclosure "Point #1" cannot be as accurately evaluated as those described above. Since they occurred at about the same time as the others, it is considered possible that they too have been caused by interfering radar signals.

Weather data would be useful in determining if some distant (200 plus mile) radar set could have caused the interference. The data needed are as follows:
a. Temperature vs height
b. Moisture vs height
c. Cloud conditions.

Capt R. L. Page

Large amount of ground clutter indicates anomalous weather conditions which would be suitable for seeing interference along 8's from a distant radar set.

This image appears to be a polar coordinate graph or chart with a complex grid pattern radiating from a central point. The graph has multiple concentric circular and radial lines. There are some handwritten notations on the graph, including what seem to be time or measurement markers like "T/MNS", "T/10", and various numerical annotations. The graph is marked with numerical scales along the edges, ranging from 0 to 50 degrees. At the bottom of the image, there is a ruler or scale for measurement.
