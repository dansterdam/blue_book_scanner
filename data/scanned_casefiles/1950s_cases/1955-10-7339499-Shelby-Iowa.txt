COUNTRY: USA

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO: DR-UNL-55

AREA REPORT NO: USAF

CITY/COUNTY/LOCATION: Shelby, Iowa, USA

DATE OF ORIGIN: 6 Oct 55
DATE OF INFORMATION: 1 Oct 55

SOURCE: Lotsch, (COL) ATCS

PREPARED BY (Officer): Capt. WG LISCOE, Captain, USAF

TT TD/CWC 679, COMDL 789th AGAM Sq., Omaha, Nebr.

SUMMARY: (State briefly what happened. Use direct quotes where possible)

I. CONTENTS:
PART ONE: Description of sighting by Miss Meryn Parr, Box 154, Shelby, Iowa and Miss Janet Wolgemuth, Box 47, Shelby, Iowa. Occupation - Students; Age - holy girls 15; On duty as COG observers.

PART TWO: Supplementary Investigative Efforts

PART THREE: Comments of Preparing Officer

II. SUMMARY: Unidentified flying objects were sighted by two (2) observers at COG observer post at Shelby, Iowa (GEORGE PARK 3331). Objects initially observed at 612047 Oct 55, for a period of one and a half minutes. Other objects were observed for two more periods of this same day, one and a half hours, and one and a half hours. The observers were Miss [name obscured] and Miss Janet Wolgemuth, ages - 15, Occupation - students, Shelby, Iowa. The follow-up investigation consisted of a more thorough interview of the observers and a check of other possible forces of activity in the area on that date.

I. SOURCES: a) Miss [redacted]
             b) Miss [redacted]
Address:    a) Shelby, Iowa
             b) Shelby, Iowa

Age:        a) 15
             b) 15

Occupation: a) Student
             b) Student

Education: a) 1st year high school
            b) 1st year high school

Qualifications: GOC Observers (approximately 5 months)

II. RELIABILITY: Both SOURCES seemed very sincere and very cooperative to the Investigator. Both told identical stories of what they had observed. Miss Parr stated that she believed in detailed form other space. Their school teacher (also a GOC observer) was queried on the reliability of both girls and stated that Miss [redacted] was very mature and level headed girl but that emphasis must be placed on the age and inexperience of both SOURCES when evaluating their descriptions of the sightings.

III. SOURCES' DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: All objects were spherical in shape and appeared the size of a quarter held at arm's length. Objects were observed with the naked eye and through binoculars. There were no changes in characteristics when objects were observed through binoculars. Objects appeared to be made of some shiny, silver material.

The first object seen had a slightly whirling motion and moved from SW to NW. When object was to the NW of observation point it appeared to divide into two separate spherical objects and one object appeared to drop a parachute. Fell only a short distance and then all three objects disappeared abruptly in the sky. This incident happened in a period of about one and a half minutes. Through the next one and a half hours five other objects were observed having the same general direction and characteristics as the first. Each one of these was observed for about the same length of time (one and a half minutes). No other object except the first seemed to divide or drop a parachute. All objects disappeared in the sky very abruptly. Although SOURCES could not give the altitude of objects they stated that none ever came near the horizon. The weather was a cloud record, no clouds present. Temperature warm, wind light. No sound was associated with the objects and no trail or exhaust was noted. All objects appeared small (and could not be determined).

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. Inquiries were made of farmers around the area in an effort to find a parachute. It was learned that one had been found on 2 Oct 55 by a farmer's son. He was located and the parachute obtained. The boy stated he had found the chute in a nearby field (about three and a half miles NE of GOC observation point). The parachute was of paper and had radiosondes attached to it. It was definitely identified as the type being used on ordinary weather balloons.

2. Winds aloft for the Omaha, Nebraska area were checked and found to be 20 to 25 knots at 5000 feet. From 250 degrees, at 10000 feet around 25 to 30 knots. Surface winds were light at about 5 to 10 knots. The winds were the same direction.

3. A check of the GOC aircraft log showed a total of five planes in area from 012155Z Oct 55 to 012315Z Oct 55. The five planes were identified as three single engine, one twin engine and one multi-engine. Altitude varied from low to very high.

4. A flight of two fighter interceptors were dispatched from Sioux City, Iowa GEOREF FIJN 3730. They were airborne at 012345Z Oct 55 and checked the area around Shelby, Iowa at an altitude of 1400 feet. They reported seeing nothing unusual.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the sighting was probably caused by a Radiosonde weather balloon for the following reasons:

a. The recovery of the parachute and radiosonde equipment definitely establishes the fact that the first object sighted was a weather balloon.

b. What apparently happened was that the balloon (probably released) from Weather Station at Cnaha, (also) BWRC (MATS), traveled up to a fairly high altitude and instead of exploding, as they normally do, it developed a leak and descended again. This parachute was still attached. When balloon had become deflated enough it probably released the parachute with equipment. This obviously made the balloon that might look like a cause of rising again. Since air was still escaping from balloon it probably descended again. For the additional sightings after the parachute was seen.

c. The shiny, silver appearance can be attributed to the fact that these balloons are white in color and with the reflection of the sun in the late afternoon it could possibly give an off a silvery appearance.

d. It must be pointed out that although the above hypothesis may render some explanation of the sighting, it is difficult to determine or explain how this balloon always returned to the SW before it was observed again and then abruptly disappeared into obscurity in the NW.

e. A definite factor to be remembered is the age and inexperience of the observers. The idea of having seen the initial sighting and subsequent release of the parachute may possibly have stimulated imagination, which resulted in seeing and reporting more than was actually there.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the recovery of the parachute and radiosonde equipment definitely establishes that the first sighting was generated by a radiosonde type weather balloon. Subsequent sightings can possibly be attributed to aircraft known to be in the area of the sighting and the nontechnical background of the observers.
