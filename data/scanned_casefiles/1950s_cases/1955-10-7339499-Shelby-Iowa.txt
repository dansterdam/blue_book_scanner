AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
HEADQUARTERS U.S.A.F.
ATIC, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO
CASE NO: DU-55
SUBJECT: 
T.O.: 1 Oct 55
FROM (AGCY): AISS
DATE OF INFORMATION: 1 Oct 55
SOURCE: AISS, 5th AF, TOKYO 
INVESTIGATORS: CAPT. HANS R. BERGDOLL, AG 17355
APPROVED: JOHN L. KALIVODA, Colonel, USAF, Commander

PART ONE: Description of sighting by two observers. PART TWO: Supplementary Investigative efforts. PART THREE: Comments of Preparing Officer.

SUMMARY: Unidentified flying objects were sighted by two (2) observers at GGC at 10:39 and 10:41 on 18 Sep 55 for a period of one and a half minutes. Other objects were observed at 12:40 as described in Part Two. The follow-up investigation consisted of a more thorough interview of the observers and a search for other confirming scenes of activity in the area on that date.

I. SOURCES: 
a) Miss -----
b) Miss -----
Address: a) -----, Shelby, Iowa 
b) -----, Shelby, Iowa
Age: a) 15
b) 15
Occupation: a) Student
b) Student
Education: a) 1st year high school
b) 1st year high school
Qualifications: CIC observers (approximately 3 months)

II. RELIABILITY. Ratings: Both statements agreed on by both sources as to the investigators. Miss ------ and Miss ------ told identical stories of what they had observed. Their accounts were given the closest scrutiny by the investigator; but there appears to be no reason to doubt their veracity. The cumulative impression points to a high degree of reliability.

III. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: All objects were spherical in shape and were observed visually and through binoculars. There were no changes in characteristics when observed under differing conditions. There were no sounds associated with the objects. The objects appeared to be a metallic, shiny, gray color.

The first object seen had a slightly wavering motion and moved from SSW to NE. It disappeared in the west. After 15-20 minutes, 5 other similar spherical objects appeared to drop from a parachute-like formation. The parachute fell slowly, and the 5 objects separated and went in different directions at high speed. One and one half hours later, 5 other objects were observed having the same general direction and speed as the first 5.

Although altitude cannot be determined accurately, the movement and behavior indicates they were at a high altitude. All objects disappeared in the sky very abruptly. No trail or exhaust was observed. No wind, lightning, or atmospheric disturbances were noted. All objects' appearance and actions were well documented and agree on by both observers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:
On Oct. 25, 1955 he reported "a strange object around the area in an effort to find a downed aircraft". He was located and the parachute obtained. The boy stated he had found the chute in an empty field (about 5 miles NW of Shelby, Iowa). The parachute was undamaged and identified as the type being used on ordinary weather balloons.
A wind check of the CCC aircraft log showed a total of five planes in area from 0121 55? Oct 25 to 0125?? Oct 25. Five planes were identified in three single-engine, one twin engine and one multi-engine. Altitudes varied from low to very high.
GEORGI FIJN 3730 - They were at 0123 55 Oct 25 and checked the area around Shelby, Iowa at an altitude of 4400 feet. They reported seeing nothing unusual.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE: 2 4605D AKS 02-OCt-o-55
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, that 21 . son was possibly caused by a radiosonde type weather balloon. This recovery of the balloon flight was definitely established.
The recovery of the flight was accomplished seconds ahead of the parachute and radiosonde equipment still attached. When the balloon reached its highest altitude and started descending again with the parachute and radiosonde equipment still attached, the air was still escaping from balloon and was probably descended again. This may account for the additional sighting observed prior to the final disappearance.

If the above hypothesis may render some explanation of the initial sighting, it is difficult to determine or explain how this target was observed again and then abruptly disappeared into obscurity in the NW.
A definite factor to be remembered is the size and characteristics of the observers. The idea of having seen the initial sighting and subsequent release of the parachute may possibly have stimulated imaginations, resulting in reporting more than was actually there.
HANS BISHOPS
Captain USAF 
COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the recovery of the parachute and radiosonde equipment definitely established that the first sighting was generated by a radiosonde type weather balloon. Subsequent sightings can conceivably be attributed to the same of the sighting and the still attached parachute and radiosonde equipment on the descending balloon.
