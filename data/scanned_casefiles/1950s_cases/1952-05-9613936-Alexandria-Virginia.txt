The image does not contain a photograph. The document appears to be an unclassified report describing a sighting of an unidentified object in the general area of Alexandria, Virginia. The object is described as an oval-shaped reddish glow moving very rapidly on an erratic course, with the sighting made with the naked eye. The report provides details about the location, weather conditions, and lack of ability to estimate the speed and altitude of the object. It also mentions that no phenomena were reported, and that the object was observed between hours of 2332Z and 0002Z, with national airport reports of airliners passing through the area during this period, though the crew did not report any unusual sightings.
