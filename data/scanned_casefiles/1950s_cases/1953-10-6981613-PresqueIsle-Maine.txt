Cot 23 11-15A1  1I was possible to obtain more information on this case. Observers stated  they sighted two luminous objects traveling from West to East at altitudoEs estimated to be 20,000 feet. Speed appeared greater than 600 hph. Objects were observed to emit intermittent red and green lights and appeared to be of stange shape, circular-oval. Based on available information, origin unknown. Insufficient data received to determine exact nature or origin.

Report of Radar Sightings of UFOS

INVESTIGATIONS: At 17/10/2305/OCT '53, Limestone AFS, GCA Station (C.O.N.C.A.P) reported picking up three unidentified targets approximately 8 to 10 miles northwest of the runway at an altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The returns were received at 17/10/2302/OCT, 17/10/2305/OCT and 17/10/2312/OCT. The highest speed observed was 170 knots. The targets went off scope at 17/10/2314/OCT. NO AIRCRAFT FROM PRESQUE ISLE AFB OR LIMESTONE AFS WERE AIRBORNE AT THE TIME. The objects displayed no lights and were tracked only on radar. The weather was reported as generally good with 10/10 scattered clouds.

Weather Conditions: Surface temp - 42 deg F. Air temp - 41.6 deg F. Dew Point - 35 deg F. Winds - 12.5 mph from 270 deg. Visibility - 15,000 yds.
