Report of Radar Sightings of UFOBS

I. INITIAL REPORT: Initial Report of Subject UFOBS made 17 October 1953
Ref: TIG 151-3 from Commander 528th Air Defense Group Presque Isle AFB, Maine
17/17/Oct 53.

II. INVESTIGATION: At 17/0200/Oct 53, Limestone AFB, GCA Station (CODERS HIGH 5461), in a
GCA Radar scope, Presque Isle AFB, GCA Station observed in an FPS-3 Radar scope, Presque Isle AFB, GCA Station went into operation at 17/0202/
Oct 53. The objects were located and observed by W/SGT. STANLEY TOTERAS, W/SGT.
SENT T. WESEL, T/SGT NORMAN E. FALLS and A/1c WILLIAM M. WHITELY of the 1974th
AACS Sq. Air Communications Service. Observers stated that at 17/0445/Oct 53, during the
period 17/0200/Oct 53 to 17/0445/Oct 53, Initial Report indicated duration
of observation 16/0200/Oct 53 to 17/0445/Oct 53. This a pronounced, uncertain
observation was 12/0200/Oct 53 to 17/0445/Oct 53. Objects were approximately
One (1) FL-89 aircraft was scrambled at 17/0206/Oct 53 to attempt interception.

TO: Detailed or electronic observation or contact was made. The objects
observed at irregular intervals, in groups of three (3) to eight (8). They
first appeared at high rate of speed, climbing at approximately 340 degrees (App
340 degrees). From NW Quadrant obliquely traveled in approximately same path,
with about 225 degrees and then disappeared. In ground contact, (App 225 degrees) and (App
225 degrees). All objects traveled at approximate speed of eighty (80) to
one hundred (100) miles per hour. There was no apparent correlation with weather.
Work parallax, altitude, followed standard procedures. Radar contact was plotted
on 2-35 Scope. Altitude estimated at about 12,000 to 15,000 feet. Altitude could not be determined, due to
limitations of GCA equipment. Estimated to be from 7000' to 5000' feet.
Altitude estimated at a three (3) degree angle made of tilt of radar antenna.
D-35 Scope maintained intermittently from 17/0200/Oct 53 to 17/0250/Oct 53.
