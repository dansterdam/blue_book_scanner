1. Request your comment on the acceptability of the following
release to Yr. __________ for the Associated Press:

       Captain, USAF, __________ presently on
active duty, did not see the "flying saucers" himself. He
did turn in a report on an alleged sighting of 3 or 4 shiny
objects by 3 TACA crewmen. The sighting supposedly took place
over Guatemala City Airport on March 15, 1950.

       "The objects, according to __________ recollection of
the information given to him by the 3 TACA crewmen, were
flying at high altitude, and at very high speeds. They were
reported to make no noise and left no vapor trail."

1. The following request for information was received from Mr. Elton Fay, Associated Press,

"Could we run a check on this report?

"A reserve officer-pilot, who recalled AD from job flying for an airline, was flying, after recall, over Central America area. While in the area of Guatemala he saw object which he believed a flying saucer. Subsequently he saw several others.

"He was released to inactive duty, then a few weeks later called back for the works AD at Mobile. While there officers at that base decided to hold seminar on subject of flying saucers. When he mentioned the objects he had seen to other officers, was put on the program.

"Shortly before the seminar, an A-2 major came to see him. He was questioned for about two hours. Tape recording was made. When he mentioned names, A-2 made immediate phone calls to confirm. At the end of the interrogation, A-2 was described as telling (listen, there is only this: a flying saucer. You won't discuss them.'

"From other sources we learn this interrogation occurred at Mobile on 30 March 1950.

"Before using any story, we would like to get whatever information or guidance the Air Force can supply."

2. Inquiry has revealed that the above is substantially correct, but that the first name of Hall is incorrectly reported, and that AF has no information to confirm or contradict this paragraph 3 of Mr. Fay's query.

3. It is requested that the correct name and rank of date of sighting, and reported sighting be made available to this office.

4. No release of this information will be made public until it has been properly coordinated, and cleared by persons who have authority to declassify such material.

directly south. A few moments later two more objects appeared moving one directly behind the other,
heading north. A third object passed over after the
first two disappeared. 16 was surprised to find TACA

appeared a few moments later. All objects were
traveling north. Estimated the turning radius was 15 to 20 miles.

piece oval.
