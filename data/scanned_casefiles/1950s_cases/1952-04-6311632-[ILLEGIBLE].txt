Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
The additional sheets of the same side paper, if necessary.

There are observations made months ago on a strange cloud like object that had no motor noises whatsoever and appeared to be hovering and performing gyrations of a very high rate of speed and made a very sharp turn to disappear from sight.
This seems highly unusual and significant of the performance of some unknown object with physical characteristics and maneuverability vastly superior and different to any known aircraft. Such objects change direction, hover, and accelerate at rates far exceeding any known airplane or other aerial vehicle or object observed. This raises the question as to whether some unconventional developments or performances of an emerging new type aerial vehicle or object are actually being observed or tested over this area.

My observations lasted over a period of 20 to 30 minutes, 30 or more sightings of these objects came across the sky. These objects were observed closely enough to determine that they were not normal planes, balloons, or any known type of aerial object. Their performance was so radically different as to suggest an entirely new and unconventional type of aerial vehicle.

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]

Dear Sir:

The following is an account received on the night of April 22, 1952 between the hours of 22:35 and 22:40 from an investigator one mile north of the city limits of Washington, D.C. by Capt. Miegel.

I observed at least twenty-five bright objects in the sky moving in a formation. They were moving at an extremely fast rate and appeared to be very high in the atmosphere. They appeared to be flying in a straight line and then would suddenly make a sharp turn. There were no lights showing on the objects, although it was quite dark. The objects were traveling from south to north.

The approximate time of the observation was from 10 to 15 seconds, and I estimate their speed to be approximately 670 miles per hour. The said indication of these objects, which appeared to be very high in the atmosphere, resembled more of a metallic appearance rather than an illuminated or lighted condition. They seemed to disappear very suddenly without any gradual fading away.

The weather was clear and there was no wind. The witnesses claim to be officers of long experience and expressed the definite opinion that the objects observed were not ordinary aircraft.

Most of these lights have a conspicuous an apparent 'Courtesy' flash this is also a strange thing is light of the ground observations and that they appeared to be in a hurry in many cases they are reported in many cases as some type of celestial aeor or body of some type and that they are seen coming at a great speed so rapidly that they cannot be accrately located or identified. but not one of the observers have ever report[ed] that they have seen anything like a solid object or any details of a physical nature."

Transcription of the text in the image:

Thousands of intelligent beings have come a long way to visit their fellow beings on earth, as the growing number of flying saucer sightings, though not officially recognized as such, indicates. Their spacecrafts are now frequently seen all over the world. I would call the attention of whoever may read this letter to the fact that the motives and conduct of these visitors from outer space are invariably friendly and in no way hostile.

What they seem to be after is neither conquest nor colonization, but rather a friendly exchange of ideas and knowledge for the mutual benefit of both worlds. Their technology being far superior to ours, they could easily conquer and subjugate us, but instead they have maintained an attitude of non-interference and have refrained from taking any aggressive action whatsoever. Their obvious desire seems to be merely to observe and study us, much as we might study a colony of ants, without destroying or disturbing it.

The general impression I have gathered from my contacts with them is that they are a race of highly evolved and cultured beings, far in advance of us in both intellectual and spiritual development. Incidentally, their physical appearance, as I have seen it, is strikingly handsome and dignified, the voice melodious and the manner courteous and gracious.

It would be a tragic mistake if the people of earth, out of fear or prejudice, were to greet these Celestial Visitors with hostility. Rather, we should make every effort to make them feel at home and to learn from them all that they are willing to teach us. After all, we are all part of the same universal family, children of the same divine Father, and it is high time we recognized this fact and acted accordingly.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

My opinion is that the sightings of these objects could in a number of instances be attributable to misidentification of common objects. However, there are a sufficient number of sightings that appear to be authentic observation of unusual aerial phenomena to warrant further investigation. There have been instances where sightings have been made of phenomena that cannot be explained in terms of any known aerial objects or natural atmospheric conditions.

There is still much uncertainty as to the nature of these objects and whether they represent phenomena of extraterrestrial origin. More comprehensive and intensive investigations will be required before any definitive conclusions can be reached. At the present time I am puzzled in an unwarranted way. We must continue our efforts to obtain all possible information from continued observation and study of these aerial objects.
