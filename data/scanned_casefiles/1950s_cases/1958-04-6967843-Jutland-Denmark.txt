A6O CASE

INFO ONLY 
KIRTLAND AFB, New Mexico   Albuquerque, N. Mex.  

4220987 T-FA-5 UNION (Declassification)
Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico

23 May 1958

SUBJECT: Release of Information in Unidentified Flying 
Object Reports for Civilian Analysis and Possible 
Publication 

TO: Commander 
1700th Test Squadron (D.Development) 
Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico 

TO: Office of Information Services (AFOIS) 
Secretary of the Air Force 
Washington 25, D.C.

1. In accordance with paragraph 3, AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 
1955, I hereby request permission to release for civilian analysis 
and possible publication, my Unidentified Flying Object sighting 
report to the 4602d Air Defense Observation Squadron, Air Defense 
Command Center, Kirtland AFB, on the evening of 
22 April 1955. The sighting was conducted by █████████ to the 
satisfaction of this office. Further instructions for 
approval of this request are as follows: 

	a. In accordance with paragraph 18, AFR 200-2, no classi-
fication is necessary to protect any information of the kind listed, 
nor does any of the data reported under paragraph 15 require classi-
fication.

	b. The reports do not fall into any category restricted 
under paragraph 1b and 2a, AFR 190-2, dated 1 December 1955, or 
paragraphs 3, AFR 190-16, dated 24 July 1957. Therefore, these reports
meet the requirements of paragraph 2, AFR 190-16.

	c. Accordingly, I would be very grateful if, in keeping 
with this policy expressed in paragraph 1A, AFR 190-2 and paragraph 
2, AFR 190-16, you would release the aforementioned reports as 
requested.

2. I would also appreciate further clarification of paragraph 
11, AFR 200-2. Does this paragraph restrict military personnel from 
unofficially interviewing civilians who have sighted Unidentified 
Flying Objects, such interviews being for the purpose covered under 
paragraph 1a(3), AFR 100-2, which states that the military without 
worldwide intelligence access to information as civilians have, 
would not be restricted in respect to civilian interviews?

3. Above requests have been referred to you at a by-level consultation 
with the Office of Information Services at base level.

COMMENTS (use reverse, if necessary)

1. A thorough check of our files indicates that the two sightings referenced by Sgt. [redacted] were not received by this office and no findings are available for release.

2. Our interpretation of Sgt. [redacted]'s request is that he be given permission to release the information concerning the two sightings to civilians. Analysis - not the findings or analyses made by this office.

3. Reference/paragraph 2 of Sgt [redacted]'s letter. Paragraph 11y AFR 200-2 means exactly what it says. No, I repeat, no Air Force personnel, other than those of the OIS, or those and directed, will converse with private individuals concerning UFO cases. A military person, given an unofficial interview, might still be quoted, and when he is quoted his statements are usually construed to be those of the Air Force.

UAF/C - 21 APRIL. NO CASE - INFO ONLY

27 June 1958

Dear Sgt. █████,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 23 May 1958 concerning unidentified flying object sightings of 1st and 2nd April 1958 at Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Neither of these two sightings were forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for evaluation and we have no record of these two sightings.

There are no restrictions covering your use of these sightings. Therefore, you are free to submit these to any organization you choose for analysis or evaluation and you may publish an account of these sightings if you desire.

For your information, I am inclosing the latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet on the subject of unidentified flying objects which denies the existence of any authenticated evidence to substantiate the existence of the popularly termed "flying saucers."

Sincerely yours,

LAWRENCE J. █████

"SPACESHIP" OVER DENMARK--Danish officials have appealed for witnesses to corroborate a woman's statement that she saw a "spaceship" on Apr. 15 near Broager, south Jutland. The woman described the spaceship as a big, black, low-flying object bearing on it a white and yellow circle which seemed to move. She said that when it flew over Broager a number of horseshoe-shaped objects with a "glowing light" issued from it. About 20 other witnesses reported seeing "a triangular spaceship" in the vicinity at the same time. One witness said he saw a "sea of flames" in the sky. A member of the Danish interplanetary society said that in the past few days he had been "flooded" with reports of triangular spaceships and other celestial phenomena.

No Case (Information Only)                                     1 April 1958
Willoughby, Ohio

Cited as seeing a UFO; Frank -------- of Willoughby, Ohio, made a very special report. At 6:30 PM, April 1st, he was reluctant to report it, as no one would probably believe him or would think he was an April Fool; but an odd driving noise drew Frank's attention away from his car that seemed to be about 60 feet high, 20 to 25 feet from him and 40 to 50 feet from his bumpers, and shaped like an ice cream cone. It was an unknown color, between orange and red, and glowed as though it had wires on the inside. It remained in the road and the air, a mild noise was heard as if a bubble burst down and around it. Confused, more very twisted, it flew back to where it originally stood without changing its position. By this time, the object was quite a bit smaller, now luminous, a lunar white color shining from back to the spot, so the whole scene was disturbed, but the car engine ran rugged and constant.

police and military officials were at a loss last April 7th to explain reports
of a bright flying object with a long red tail minutes apart between 7 and 11
p.m. near Hamilton-Middletown. Traffic on a road near Columbus was stopped as
drivers halted to watch the object, which flew around the east and south sides
of the city before disappearing in the west.

4 Flyers Die
in Stratojet
Explosion

NORTH COLLINS, N.Y.
April 10 - (UP) - Four crew-
men perished today when an
B-47 Stratojet bomber ex-
ploded in flight while attempt-
ing to refuel over this western
New York community.
The sleek six-jet bomber from
Limestone, O., Air Force base
was just preparing to make a re-
fueling approach on a KC-97
propeller-driven tanker plane at
about three miles when blew apart
about one mile astern. The tanker
was not damaged. Its crew re-
ported seeing the wreckage
"hurtle earthward, but no para-
chutes.
Three bodies were found in one
large piece of wreckage, ap-
parently the front of the plane.
Luckily the automatics identified
the dead as Maj. Harold L. Kelly,
33, aircraft commander, Escuin-
de, Tex.; Lt. Col. John Robert Guyer,
33, pilot, Wilmington, Del.; First
Lt. Richard Feller, co-pilot,
Pompano Beach, Fla. and First
Lt. Albert Gene Mongold, 24,
Shreveport, La., the navigator.
Mongold's body was the last to
be found and identified.
Westover Air Force base in
Massachusetts reported the
Stratojet carried four men, with
one apparently an instructor. The
B-47 was flying a "normal train-
ing mission," Westover officials
said.
The big bomber was not armed
and did not carry any nuclear
bombs.
Hundreds of residents wit-
nessed the explosion and fire-
ball of the wreckage, which scat-
tered over a five-mile-wide area
of farmland about 20 miles south
of Buffalo.

A flying saucer reported from Johannesburg, South Africa, on April 11, 1958, belongs in this category. Hundreds of witnesses reported a mysterious starlike object maneuvering in the northern sky on three successive nights at speeds in excess of 2000 miles an hour. Most observers agreed that “The Thing” could not have been any known aircraft because its speed was too great; it sometimes hovered stationary in the air, and repeatedly changed color from white to red to deep scarlet. One member of an Interplanetary Club who watched it through binoculars described the UFO as saucer-shaped, with a rim like a soup plate around the edge.

Members of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Mintirakt Station, near Johannesburg, were amused by the variety of reports on “The Thing.” The mysterious object in the night skies was in fact a South African Air Force Dakota aircraft, flying back and forth so that the Mintirakt Station could test the calibration of its tracking instruments. In addition to the usual navigation lights, the aircraft had carried a bright, flashing light so that it could be photographed [7a].
