(7) See attached report.

(8) None

(9) None

(10) None

(11) See statement Colonel L. G. Duggar attached.

(12) Professor of Air Science and Tactics, University of Georgia. Senior pilot with approximately 4,000 hours military flying time

It is my belief that any lights seen below cloud level on the night of this observation would have required any aircraft and especially any jet to have been easily heard. The Athens area is normally quiet and jets can be easily heard up to 30,000 to 40,000 feet altitude.

STATEMENT

At the time of sighting, the Professor of Air Science and Tactics, University of Georgia, (Reporting Officer) was flying a C-46 between Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, and Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia. Landing at Dobbins AFB at approximately 2100 hours. At 2035 hours, the time of the reported sighting, I estimate general clouds covering most of the area to the north and northwest in the direction of Athens, Georgia, as well as in the local area.

I heard it on Channel 3 calling Dobbins, a distance of approximately 60 nautical miles west of Athens. Visibility was comparatively low at 1,000 to 1,500'. I estimate that any traffic at 5,500 feet or above would have been obscured by clouds. No flight in or out of Athens was scheduled at that time nor is Athens on any airway.

27 April 1954

In addition to the information contained in the letter from Detachment 4160, AFROTC, University of Georgia, dated 27 April 1954, I would like to add that this was not a mirage. I actually saw this formation coming out of the south going due north, traveling at a tremendous rate of speed which I couldn't estimate. The smoothness and the soundless effect was remarkable.

A few seconds after they went north, coming directly from the trail they had taken, a white object which appeared to be about the size of a baseball went southwest in a blast of speed. In fact it was out of sight before I could call the attention of the others to it.

It was through scattered clouds and disappeared into the southeast. It was at a tremendous height and was a brilliant white light.
