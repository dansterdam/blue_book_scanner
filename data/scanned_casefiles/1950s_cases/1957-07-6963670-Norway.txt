Other THIS OBJECT APPEARS TO RESULT FROM AN INVESTIGATION IN A GLASS THEORY WHICH THIS PHOTO COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN

Evaluation of Source Reliability PROBABLY GOOD

Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT APPEARS TO RESULT FROM A DISCUSSION OF THE SUN'S RAYS PASSING THROUGH AN IMPERFECTION IN A GLASS IN THE SURFACE OF A WINDOW BEING MUCH CLOSER TO THE CAMERA THAN THE CLOUD SCALE. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING MORE THAN A FOCAL POINT TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE. THE RAYS PASSED THROUGH A SPECIFIC POINT CAUSING THIS EFFECT. (CONTINUED WITH THE MAIN PHOTO THROUGH GLASS)


- page 2 -

In August 1950 an American tourist in Norway snapped a picture of a group of horses on a cliff above the seacoast, and was amazed to find some time later that the print showed a large white, doughnut-shaped object hovering in the sky above the coast. Puzzled by this apparent evidence of a flying saucer that was visible to the camera but not to her, she submitted the facts to ATIC investigators.

Thorough study of the negative, the camera, possible sources of reflection in the landscape at the time the photograph was taken, failed to account for the mysterious intruder. Obviously, not a cloud, the image closely resembled a smoke ring, but the photograph had not been making and there were no sources of smoke in the neighborhood. The experts were baffled and one of them thought of a new possibility and again questioned the witness: had she by any chance been wearing a ring when she took the picture?

She had—a sparkling diamond. If the angle of the sun, the direction she was facing, and the position of her ring finger in relation to the camera lens, and to the sun had been exactly right, the annular image would have been reflected into the lens at the instant she snapped the picture. The resulting bright ring would look exactly like the UFO that appeared on the negative [1].

NORWAY

20 JULY 1957

On 20 Jul, 1957 an American tourist in Norway took a snapshot of a lord. The film was not developed for some time afterwards.

It was only, after the film was developed that the witness noticed an unusual object. The witness had not observed the UFO while taking the picture. Also, the witness could not remember any sound.

The object appears to have resulted from diffusion as the sun's rays passed through an imperfection in glass. The object appears to be faded, white, much closer to the camera than the landscape. This could have been nothing more than a film to the photographer, as the camera passed through a specific position, but this coincided with the moment the photo was taken.

World Roundup

Saucer photographed over Norway
She never saw it!

ONE DAY IN July 1957, Mrs. William Felton Barrett, of Great Barrington, Mass., U.S.A. who was on a cruise with Norwegian waters with the Stella Maris, had gone ashore in Norway. Mr. Barrett took a photograph of a fjord—she cannot now remember the name of it. The film was not developed for some time afterward, and then to her amazement, this saucer-like image of a strange object with a terrific beam of light emanating from it, appeared on the print! Mrs. Barrett, who paid a visit to her camera recently, found that the picture was taken near Stavanger, and all that she could see at the time was the actual view of the fjord and surroundings in the lens of the camera while taking the picture. Mrs. Barrett said there was no sound at all.

GLOWING OBJECT OVER GERMAN TOWN

A flying report from Kavelstetten, Germany, stated that people had seen a strange glowing object there on the night of September 2. One man said he saw the object for about 15 minutes. A woman working at her North Sea farm visible at the time. A woman said at a terrific speed emitting what looked like rays. Her husband reported seeing a 'saucer-like, yellow tinged' mass of a very bright color. The full details after of the United States Air Force base at Kavelstetten are not yet available.

Dr. Allen Hynek

60 Garden Street
Cambridge 36, Massachusetts

Dear Allen:

Thank you for your confirming letter regarding our Corporate Membership. We might take you up on that business of interest to astronomers.

I am returning to you the 620 Kodachrome transparency which shows an unidentified image. Please note that we took the transparency out of its original carton. I was marking of the film. This enabled us to tell the type of camera in which the picture was made. In this case we wanted to know if the camera has a bellows. I am told that the camera was an 028 Bantam and that it does have a front bellows. The image, however, is not the type you would expect from a bellows leak.

We are quite sure the image is not an emulsion defect, nor is it a processing defect. It was obviously caused by light. There are various explanations as to what could cause the image, and of course, some of these can be confirmed. It would be interesting to find out, however, whether the picture was taken through a car windshield, or whether it was a lightly curved windshield. Another possibility was reflection from a ring on a plate.

We have a number of people here who have been following the stories on "flying saucers". To them the photograph seems to verify all of the reports to date of site and shape. I'm not a believer in most of these cases of flying saucers, but would help in the final outcome.

Best regards.

Yours very truly,

SKY FARM - NORTH EGREMONT - MASSACHUSETTS
Sat.,June 6th,1959

Secretary of Defense,Neil L. Mc Elroy
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Mc Elroy:

My friend and neighbor Mr. William H.Berridge, suggests I send you the enclosed photograph.

While in England last summer, I took the color transparency of this photograph to the Flying Saucer Review magazine, and the Daily, the Ken Tompkins Poet Newspaper was not only intensely interested, but used in the Nov.dec. 1958 issue of their magazine.

Recently I received a letter from the Hon.Brinsley Trench Ltd. of 112 Whitfield St. London W.1., permission to reproduce this photograph on the back cover of a book entitled "Contact with a Flying Saucer" by Dino Kraspedon which was published in Portuguese in Brazil in 1957 and is being translated in English by Mr. Armstrong's Film.

I am also enclosing my one and only colored enlargement of the original transparency I took in Norway, so I would appreciate it. In fact, the transparency is at the photographers now, as I have promised several interested periodicals, colored copies.

I also quote from a letter received from PARTENON-which is a non-profit making organization publishing "New-AGE-BOOKS" in Halsingborg, Sweden. The lines are to ask you for the permission to reproduce the photo of a saucer flying on edge with a terrain. Taken in Norway in 1957, in the Swedish edition of "Flying Saucers Past or Future" a complete by Max Miller, besides, we would like to make a lantern slide to add to our collection of slides of flying saucers. For this purpose we need a first class positive of the photo."

There seems to be so much interest in my snap-shot, I thought I would follow Mr. Berridge's advice and send you my colored print. I have never been particularly interested not believed in flying saucers, but friends who are, express so much about my photograph. I am beginning to believe you too might find it of some interest. At any rate - I shall be interested in having your opinion on the subject.

My late husband was Vice President of the Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., and was responsible for starting the chemical division that CO. As you probably know he was also responsible for producing Helium gas, used in dirigibles during the first world war. His record may be found in "Who's Who".

Sincerely yours

Dear Sir:

I am enclosing a letter written by you to Mrs. [redacted] Sky Farm, North Egremont, Massachusetts, with reference to her letter which was addressed to Secretary of Defense, McElroy.

Mrs. [redacted] has filled out, you will notice, the additional information, as requested. Since then, she has received a letter from the editor of the Swedish Magazine, PARTHENON Cedersstrassen 6 Halsingborg, Sweden

asking for a copy of this photograph, and a film. In his letter he states that a friend of his during a vacation in Germany last summer--1958--had a somewhat similar experience. One day he said he saw a circle of a strong beam of light in the sky.

In your letter you state that as soon as the evaluation is complete you will forward the results to Mrs. [redacted] and return your photograph. If your department cares to keep the enclosed photograph and film, you may do so, as I have had duplicates made of the original film.

Mrs. [redacted] who is an intimate friend of my wife's, is now on her way to London, and therefore I should like to have you advise me about the evaluation, and I shall take pleasure in forwarding it to her.

Very truly yours,
[Signature]
