AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. An unidentified not light was sighted by the pilot and radar observer of a T-33 aircraft near Goose AFB, Labrador on 17 June 1953.

2. The slow, smooth motion of 10,000 feet, sighted a red ball or light by the T-33 crew, aroused suspicion. The object did not appear to be that of a jet or prop or jet aircraft, but could not be identified.

3. The pilot began a visual interception. He closed in on the object for a few minutes, but the object slowly pulled away. First contact was made of its shape to be round or oval.

4. No GCI or CCA contact was made with the object.

5. Weather sequence at time of sighting was 17,000 overcast, visibility 30 miles, temperature 32 degrees, wind west at 5 knots, altitude 29,400.

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer:

1. The pilot of the T-33 aircraft was Fallen G. Nichols, 2nd Lieutenant, AO 2nd Lt Flynn, other pilot was Capt. John J. Korn.

2. The only other aircraft in the area was Air Force RT-33, CG-062 which was flown by Maj. Kearns at 02525, 20 minutes before at time of sighting.

3. The possibility of meteorological explanation is 12 miles of ground fog because of the overcast condition, but it is unlikely that the sighting represents any fog diversion for the observer.

4. It appears that the incident represents an unidentified flying object caused either by meteorological or celestial phenomena.

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Of the last batch of 4 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is any question is the 12 June Covington, Georgia. It is essential to know here the duration of sighting. A lot depends on this. Can you get this for us?

Regarding the Detroit 11 June case is there anything in this that a good landing would not possibly likewise George AFB in June would appear that since second radar did not pick up the signals the most probable explanation is faulty radar. I assume that the GCI had radar available.

And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.
Anything new on:
    5 March   Shaw AFB
    3 March   Lake AFB - Film?
    17 Feb    Port Austin
    25 March  San Antonio
    12 April  Stead AFB

I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's clearance so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything about this, but just mentioning it anyway. I hope it comes through before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
[Signature]

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt.:

This is quite a batch coming back at you. I think the idea of being in readiness with a press release is a good idea. I should like to have Dr. Hollinger's comments on our Pinchbottle cases.

In two cases here we are taking the liberty of sending out Form As, with an accompanying note stating that the sighting has been referred to us as having possible astronomical significance, and would they oblige us by filling out the report. If you have any objection to this procedure please let us know.

As to seeing you in the near future, I hope so too. Did you know I am sailing for Europe on August 26th. I'll send you a postcard from Paris! The project here will lie fallow. I'm afraid, during September, but we will attack these problems with great strength in October. How to get on to business.

There appears to be only two possible pinchbottles in this last batch: The 21 June Okinawa and the 22 June Goose AFB. On both of these I should like to request a complete report and follow-up.

The Okinawa one may yet prove to be a balloon, though the evidence is against it. Object going against wind and object disappearing into cloud with relative velocity of 45 kts. I think the best thing to do is to wait for further data. I am asking Jen to make both you and me on these follow-ups because there is no point in having follow-ups unless they are followed up!

The Goose AFB also needs follow-up with special attention to the 9 questions on our Form "Bya".

Now as to the others: we pass by with a smirk the little monkey man.

As to the Tinker Tower cases, how come such an epidemic of balloons? Can't they tell a balloon from a hole in the ground? Most interesting of the Tinker batch was July 3rd. Glad to see that a camera was used. What did the pictures look like?

And on the July 6th case, I don't think much of the observer.

On the others, the notes we have made on the Form I just about cover the case.

We have some reference TWX but we don't know to what they refer. They would probably be important only if they refer to our pinchbottle cases.

Please give our regards to JD and indoctrinate him fully into the system we have developed. Any comments that either you or he can make on this method of handling sightings would of course be appreciated.

Cordially,
Allen
