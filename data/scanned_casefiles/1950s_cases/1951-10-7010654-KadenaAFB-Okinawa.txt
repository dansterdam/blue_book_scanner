KADENA AIR FORCE BASE 
OKINAWA, RYUKYU ISLANDS
7 OCTOBER 1951

This is a report of a sighting of unidentified aerial objects on 7 October 1951 at Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa.

At approximately 1820 hours on 7 October 1951, four unidentified aerial objects were observed by several officers and airmen stationed at Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands. The objects were first sighted by the Airborne Control and Warning Squadron on radar, and visual contact was then established by personnel on the ground.

The objects were described as bright white lights, round in shape, and traveling at an estimated speed of 600 to 900 knots. The objects were observed to make sudden 90 degree turns and other abrupt maneuvers. The sighting lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before the objects disappeared from view.

No explanation for the identity or origin of the objects has been determined. The incident was reported to higher headquarters for further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reported sighting of an unidentified flying object over Kadena Air Base, Okinawa on 7 October 1951.

SUMMARY: On the evening of 7 October 1951, an unidentified flying object was observed by personnel at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. The object was first detected on radar at approximately 2300 hours and was observed visually by airmen on the ground. The object moved at a high rate of speed and exhibited unusual maneuverability, executing tight turns and abrupt acceleration. Attempts were made to intercept the object, but it evaded pursuit.

DETAILS: At approximately 2300 hours on 7 October 1951, the control tower at Kadena Air Base detected an unidentified target on their radar scope. The target was observed to be moving at a high rate of speed and exhibiting unusual maneuverability. Several airmen on the ground also visually observed the object, describing it as a bright light that appeared to change direction abruptly and accelerate rapidly.

Attempts were made to scramble aircraft to intercept the object, but it evaded pursuit. Ground-based anti-aircraft weapons were also fired at the object, but it remained unaffected. The object was tracked on radar for several minutes before disappearing from the scope.

CONCLUSION: The reported sighting of the unidentified flying object over Kadena Air Base on 7 October 1951 remains unexplained. The object exhibited characteristics that were highly unusual for known aircraft or other conventional aerial phenomena. Further investigation is warranted to determine the nature and origin of the object.

9. REMARKS:
a. On 4 October 1951 at 1227Z a radar operator at the Okinawa Ground Control Intercept Station, 6th A/I "AN" (CC 2)' 55' N, 127° 15' 15" E) detected an unidentified target on his search radar scope. This target travelled at a speed of over 600 knots and was followed for approximately 12 minutes.
b. The PPI height trace was operating on a range from 0 to 120 nautical miles, indicating the target was at maximum range. The target's closeness and speed caused interference with the other scopes in the station, and the scope had to be turned off at times to prevent the interference.
c. There was no visual sighting of the object and no other echoes were seen in conjunction with it. It maintained a steady course and no known aircraft were in the area at the time. The target disappeared from the scopes, leaving no trace, and no sound or other phenomena was observed. The radar operator stated that the blip was easily seen and that radar lock-on was maintained throughout the sighting. No unusual interference or distortion of the scope presentation was noted, and the target was reported to be solid and well defined.
d. There were no indications that this object at the time of the sighting was anything other than an unidentified flying object.

2. After this object disappeared from the high beam scope, private Hannigan went back to the scope and again received an echo on a bearing of 355 degrees, elevation 2 degrees, range 30 miles approximately. The echo was picked up 4 times and it was stated that it was brighter than the average echo and that the object was traveling at very high speed. The radar operator placed these echoes at altitudes between 35,000 and 40,000 feet. He estimated the speed at 600 to 700 miles per hour. This radar operator is considered by this headquarters to be very reliable and thoroughly experienced in the operation of this radar set.
3. The PPT low beam long range scope was operating on a range from 10 to 120 miles when the sighting occurred. The indicating speed controls were essentially the same as for the high beam scope. The controller states the target operated above the terrain on this scope and that air traffic had been previously tracking.
4. The objects ground speed is estimated at 1,500 miles per hour during the first minute of detection. The velocity of this estimate is based on the controller's statement that the object disappeared within one minute from the scope. He has written record of the time of detection as 0122 hours. Investigation reveals that the exact time of disappearance was 0123 hours, which indicates a ground speed of approximately 1,500 miles per hour.
5. In addition to the two radar operators, S/Sgt. O'Keefe, AACS, also saw the radar echo of this unidentified object. He was looking at the same scope when the object appeared. He stated he could not identify the object but that it appeared as a very bright stationary target.

9. REMARKS:
A. On 9 October 1951 at 1327Z a radar operator at the Okinawa Ground Control Intercept station, call sign "YB" (260 31' 55" N, 127' 47' 15" E), detected and tracked an unidentified aircraft which approached the station and then turned away. According to the radar operator, AFSC 27290, he was tracking what he thought was a B-29 type aircraft for some time and suddenly it increased in size on the scope and he received a strong reflection. He states that the radar blip was easily distinct from the other known aircraft blips in the area and that the target appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed which he estimated to be in excess of 600 mph. According to the operator, the course of the target was erratic, first approaching the station and then turning away. He states that the track of the blip was always at a 90 degree angle to the direction of the movement. There were no other known aircraft in the vicinity. As soon as the operator went to track the target with the range only switch, the target disappeared from the scope. This occurred several times during the course of the tracking operation.
B. The PPI light beam scope was operating on a PPI scope 40 miles in diameter. The operator first picked up the target at 35 miles range traveling at a very high rate of speed. The target remained in view on the scope for approximately one minute and then faded from the screen. The target appeared as a sharp, intense blip on the scope and the radar operator states the noise level was just bac

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
ATTN: Office, D/F FSAD
2. Preliminary analysis by Mr. Hahn to Headquarters, 20th Air Force.
I. SUBJECT: Unidentified Object tracked and reported by site #51.
II. DETAILS: The Unidentified Object was tracked and reported by site #51. Additional details were obtained from all personnel concerned during debriefing at Kadena, Okinawa.
III. ANALYSIS: The characteristics of the Unidentified Object and the analysis of these facts are as follows:
1. Radar observation: The object was observed by CPS-6B radar for a distance of 3 miles, which is located at 26*33'N, 127*57'E, a few miles North of Kadena, Okinawa.
2. Track was made on the high beam of the CPS-6B radar for a distance of 27 miles. The object was traveling at an average speed of approximately 1,850 mph and increased range to 152 miles and disappeared from the high beam. The total distance traveled by the object was calculated to be 97 miles.
3. The time of travel from the closest point to the object until it disappeared was 2 minutes. The distance traveled was calculated thus: 27 + 70 = 97 miles. The speed of the object was calculated for the 50 miles in 2 minutes to be 1,500 mph.
4. The antenna speed of the object was calculated to be 520 miles per hour.
5. The radar scope showed the object was illuminated for 2 minutes. The distance traveled was calculated thus: 50 miles in 2 minutes is 1,500 miles per hour. This calculation appears correct.
at 15*. The antenna speed was that: The antenna was timed and established to be rotating at 15 rps.
1. All of the electronic characteristics are known of the intercepting radar.
The interrogator-responsor time was 1/1000 sec. The band was 10 cm, and the pulse rate was 600 pps.
2. The blip displayed on the face of the 12" was unusually large and contained no modulation, thus establishing the width of the object.
3. The condition was that the normal movement of the blip, thus establishing the width of the object.
HIGH BEAM:
The high beam operator states the scope presentation showed a blip which would indicate an altitude of approximately 60,000 to 70,000 feet. It is accepted in this report that the object was changing elevation and range as well as speed.
The radar high beam has a beam width of .8 degree at the half-power point; thus at 60,000 feet, the beam width would be 840 yards (1/2 mile) wide, and at 70,000 feet, the beam width would be 980 yards (1/2 mile) wide. The blip observed on the high beam scope was 1/2 mile in width, which correlates with the calculated beam width.

AF FORM 112 - PART II

15 Oct 51
1. ATTN: 0/I SPAS
At 2215, 7 Oct 1951 the object was first sighted at an altitude and increasing range towards the object was estimated at 2500 miles per hour. In other words, the object was traveling at a terrific rate of speed, the blip on the radar screen being instantaneously checked. The object was tracked at this speed for 18-23 minutes. The object then appeared to slow down to approximately 1200 miles per hour, the blip on the scope became more solid and distinct. This appeared to be a gradual maneuver, the object gradually decelerating. The object then appeared to make a 270 degree turn to the left and increased his speed again to approximately 2500 miles per hour and disappeared off the scope. The calibration charts from the scopes also calibration indicate the speed pattern observed.

2. Other radar operators in the area did not independently track the object. Radar sites at or near 127.2 did track the object. Get UL and have the initial calibration check made on or about 5/10/51. 

3. Radar site #51 located southwest of site #51 also failed to intercept the object.

4. A search was made among the instruments personnel in an attempt to find someone who could have been in contact with the object. No one was found who could have been in contact with the object.

5. The supplementary report by Mr. A of PGAS mentions that several times the object was tracked by the GCA and the object was picked up on the GCA scope. In this report it is stated that the GCA had a continuous tracking of the object as it came in, passed over, and then went back through the system causing the unusual brilliant display of the blip on the GCA scope.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
ATTN OFFICE, D/I USAF 
IR-23-52
The following information was received from the T-2 Technical Intelligence Office, Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Japan, on 5 June 1952. This is not tied into the two "sighings" mentioned in the report, but is most unlikely to be of any importance to this section. 
1. The CW frequency will used on the CW net from Kadena to Itazuke was not received satisfactorily at Kadena. Apparently the frequency from Itazuke to Kadena was not frequently experienced on this net, but it was unable to determine what hours the frequency was actually in use. A check of the APPLUSE or WHITNEY frequencies revealed that they could be received satisfactorily at Kadena, indicating that the reception difficulties were confined to this one particular frequency.
2. It is apparent that there is no photographic evidence to substantiate the two sightings. The objects noted in the sightings are not a true picture. A check the next day found the coordinates between the two bases to be off several degrees.

2. Forwarding for information is offered that the analysis, referenced above, required special calibration of the radar equipment upon which the sightings were experienced. This calibration was considered essential in order that findings and conclusions forwarded to your headquarters in the immediate future.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ATIL Office, DTF PPAP 

1. Study report 1 prepared by Mr. Antom, USAF Technical Representative: 

SUBJECT: 

The undersigned does not agree with the theory outlined in paragraph 3. The theory that the target was probably a natural object is not considered valid for the following reasons:

a. The almost constant velocity of the object, as described by the radar operators, and as indicated from inspection of the graphic plot in the records.

b. The shift of target motion from 263 degrees to 255 degrees, an approximately 90 degree change of heading, within a second period.

c. The shift of signal aspect with a change of target direction.

d. The lack of target fluctuation.

Although the target was closer to the other sites, it was detected by electronics systems, and its motions were plotted by these means. While it is certainly possible for a natural object to maintain a state of constant velocity, as indicated in paragraph 3, it is not considered that an object subject to natural forces would satisfy the conditions outlined in both paragraph 3 and paragraph 4. Initial momentum.
Air resistance.
Gravity.

It is not considered that a radical shift of heading could be caused by interaction of the above forces, since (a) and (b) are dynamically on-based, and (c) would not affect the handling of the aircraft.

In view of the above, it must be concluded that the target in question was not of natural origin. This conclusion is supported by observations made during the sightings. Substantiation of this theory: An elaboration of these points follows:

Paragraph 3.c. above. This phenomenon is not in agreement with normal acceleration patterns of natural objects. The dynamics of motion of a natural object, such as a meteor or a balloon, are normally independent of target heading. However, a change of target direction, as noted, is a characteristic of guided or controlled flight.

Paragraph 3.d. above. Normal target fluctuations, as mentioned, would be expected from a natural object because of atmospheric influences, such as wind shear, turbulence, etc. The lack of such fluctuations suggests a stabilized plat form or controlled flight.

In conclusion, the observers of the target, which was detected and its motions recorded electronically, have provided data which indicates the object was not of natural origin, but was a controlled vehicle of unknown identity. Such a conclusion is based on the criteria enumerated in paragraphs 3 and 4, which would tend to eliminate natural explanations and point to a controlled, intelligently guided object.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

TITLE: UNCLASSIFIED
REPORT NO.: TR-2S-UNCLASSIFIED
DATE: 10 FEB 51
PAGE: 1 OF 11

AIR DEFENSE BRANCH, D/I PRPS

SUBJECT OBJECT

1. A further investigation was made by the Intelligence Office, D/I PRPS, of the sighting of an unidentified flying object over Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, on 7 October 1950. The report of this sighting was previously submitted as TR-220, dated 14 October 1950.

2. The particulars of this case are as follows:

a. GENERAL: The object was spotted at approx. 2230 hrs, 7 October 1950, by radar operators at the Radar Site located at Kadena AFB. This object was tracked on the radar scope and remained under observation for a period of approx. 20-25 minutes.

b. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: The object was described as being circular in shape, having a diameter of approximately 40-50 feet. It appeared to be completely dark in color. It was observed to change direction several times, making very sharp, right-angle turns, and its speed was estimated to be in the neighborhood of 500-600 knots.

c. ACTIONS TAKEN: Upon detection of the object, the Radar Site Supervisor immediately notified the Air Defense Command and sent a flash message reporting the sighting to the 6th Bomb Wing Operations Office. A visual search of the area was immediately instituted, but no visual contact with the object could be established. The object disappeared from the radar scope at approx. 2250 hrs.

d. CONCLUSION: This incident has been classified as an unidentified flying object. The object exhibited characteristics which could not be attributed to any known aircraft in the area at that time. The extreme speed and maneuverability of the object, as well as its ability to make sharp, right-angle turns, preclude the possibility of its having been a conventional aircraft.

3. The foregoing report is forwarded for your information.
