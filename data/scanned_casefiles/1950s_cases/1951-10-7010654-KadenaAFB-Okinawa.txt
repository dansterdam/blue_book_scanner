DISPOSITION FORM

SECURITY: UNCLASSIFIED

FILE NO.
SUBJECT: Request for Analysis of Electronic Sighting

TO: Atkins Capt James     FROM: ATIAC-5     DATE: 12 Sep 52

1. It is requested that you review the enclosed electronic sighting at Kadena AFB, Okinawa, 3 October 1951.

2. The report is extremely detailed and should prove interesting as a possible unidentified aerial object.

3. If Inclosure 1 is withdrawn (or not attached), the classification of this correspondence will be downgraded to Restricted in accordance with paragraph 252, AFR20-5.1.

[Signature of] Major, USAF
For Chief, Aircraft and Propulsion Branch
Technical (Analyst) Division
Air Technical Intelligence Center

TO: ATIAC-5     FROM: ATIAC-2     DATE: 1 Oct 52

1. The inclosed report has been reviewed as requested in Comment No. 1.

2. Based on the available information and the fact that two radar experts have advanced conflicting explanations of the phenomena, it is considered that further theorizing by ATIAC would be pure conjecture.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ATTLO, D/I FFAF                                                                 IR-25-52                                                                 PAGE 4     OF 11 PAGES

a. After this object disappeared from the high beam scope, Private Gonzales, USAF, Radar Operator, AFSC C2730, detected an echo on a bearing of 355 degrees, 200 miles from the GCI Station on the low beam long range scope at the AM/CPS-1. He saw this echo four times and states that it was brighter than the average echo and that it was two and one half (2 1/2) to three (3) times larger than a B-29 blip. It was solid, well defined and sausage shaped and estimated by this radar operator to be two and one half (2 1/2) to three (3) miles wide and six (6) to eight (8) miles long. The longitudinal axis of this echo was always ninety (90) degrees to the direction of movement. No change in the size, shape, brightness or rate and direction of movement of this echo was noted by Pvt. Gonzales. The last echo was fully as large and bright as the previous three. The other radar echo was not seen in connection with this unidentified echo. The last sighting of this object was at a bearing of 355 degrees, 247 statute miles from the GCI Station. At this point it disappeared into the second transmitted pulse.

f. The PPI low beam long range scope was operating on a range from 110 to 250 statute miles when the object appeared on it. The setting of the remaining scope controls were essentially the same as for the high beam scope. No interference, weather echoes or sea clutter was seen on this scope, and operation of the radar appeared normal to the operator. Routine air traffic had been previously tracked.

e. The object's ground speed is estimated at 4,800 miles per hour during the first minute of detection. The validity of this estimate is based on the operator's statement that he initially saw five consecutive radar scans and that he wrote their range and azimuth positions on the face of his scope in grease pencil. No written record of the times of detection was made. The high beam scope operator states that he did not see any radar echoes between 112 and 152 miles although the area was swept by the radar beam. However, he believes this lack of detection may have been due to his readjustment of the range of his scope at this time. He does not recall how much time elapsed or how many sweeps of the antenna occurred between the detections at 112 and 152 miles. The low beam scope was operating on a bearing of 200, 210 and 225 miles on a bearing of 355 degrees. He did not see any echoes between 225 and 247 miles although the sweep of his area at least once. This operator also readjusted the range of his scope while the object was within this range.

h. In addition to the two radar operators, Sgt. [REDACTED], AF Radar Mechanic (Ground Equipment), AFSC 30251, also saw the radar echo of this unidentified object. He was looking at the same scopes as the above operators and he concurs in their remarks. He states that about the time this object was detected permanent echoes began to increase in brightness, particularly on the island of Yoran Juan (height 503 feet), bearing 112 degrees, 51 statute miles from the GCI Station) which was seen on the low beam short range scopes. This condition continued and a short time after the unidentified object disappeared from the scopes part of the island of Okino Byaku Shima (height 307 feet, bearing 37 degrees, 85 statute miles from the GCI Station) was seen on low beam. The unidentified object's echo was never detected on the low beam short range scopes during the evening and prior to the unidentified's appearance, the two scopes on which it was seen had been checked by Sgt. [REDACTED] and the azimuth reading of this scope was approved to true north.

9. REMARKS:

a. On 3 October 1951 at 1527 a radar operator at the Okinawa Ground Control Intercept Station, 5th Air Force (260 24N, 127°10'E) detected an unidentified echo on the plan position indicator (PPI) scopes, high beam of the AN/CPS-5A Search Radar.

b. Sgt [name redacted], AF 12 244 829, Sr AGen Operator, APSC 27350, first detected this object. On a bearing of 014 degrees, 90 statute miles from the GCI Station. He states that the radar blip was only seen but not brilliant, and that it was approximately three (3) times larger than the normal echo returned by a B-29 type aircraft. Sgt. [name redacted] states that the blip was average shaped and straight and that its length was twice its width. He estimated its width to have been two (2) miles and its length four (4) miles. The long-wise axis of the blip was always at a 90 degree angle to the direction of movement. This object changed its direction of movement on the PPI scope, but the actual turn was not observed because the change in heading occurred between successive sweeps of the antenna, i.e. within 15 seconds. No noticeable change in the rate of movement, size or shape of the radar echo was noted by this operator at any time during the incident. However, he stated that the last echo from the object (when at 340 degrees, 152 statute miles from the GCI Station) was the brightest of the six echos he saw.

c. The PPI high beam scope was operating on a range from 120 to 140 miles when this object was first detected. The trace brilliance was adjusted at a barely discernible level, the signal brilliance at an intensely white level, and the focus was sharp.

d. There were no precipitation echos on this scope at the time of the sighting and no other echos were seen in conjunction with or simultaneous by with this object. No other target was seen on this scope by this operator during his tour of duty at this position.

9. REMARKS:
a. On 3 October 1951 at 1327Z a radar operator at the Okinawa Ground Control Air Defense Sector, Site #51 "A" (260 24' N, 127° 17' E) detected an unidentified echo on the plan position indicator (PPI) scope, high beam of the AN/CPS-1 Search Radar.

b. Sgt D[illegible] ATC&W Operator, AFSC 27350, first detected this object on a bearing of 041 degrees, 90 statute miles from the GCI Station. He stated that the radar was easily seen but not brilliant, and that it had been brilliant it would have appeared approximately three (3) times larger than it was. The object was near a B-29 type aircraft. Sgt [illegible] states that the blip was sausage shaped and straight and that its length was two (2) miles with a width to have been two (2) miles and its length four (4) miles. The long-axis axis of the blip was along at a 90 degree angle to the direction of movement. This object changed its direction of movement on the PPI scope, but the actual turn was not observed because the change in heading occurred between successively swept of the antenna, i.e., within 15 seconds.

c. The PPI High beam scope was operating on a range from zero to 120 statute miles when the object was first detected. The trace brilliance was adjusted at a barely discernible level, the signal being at an intensity where the noise level was just detectable, and the focus sharp.

d. There were no precipitation echoes on this scope at the time of the sighting, and no other echo were seen in conjunction with or simultaneous with this object. No other targets were seen on this scope by this operator during his tour of duty at this position.

2. Preliminary analysis by Mr. Bush to Headquarters, 20th Air Force:

I.   SUBJECT: Unidentified Object tracked and reported by site #51.

II.  PURPOSE: Analysis of the facts submitted in the original report and the remarks obtained from all personnel concerned during debriefing at Kadena, Okinawa.

III. ANALYSIS: The known basic facts concerning the intercept of the unidentified object and the analysis of these facts are as follows:

1. Object was intercepted by AF/CPS-1 radar at site #51 of the Japanese air defense net which is located at 626N/127E, a few miles North of Kadena, Okinawa on a 750 foot mountain.

2. The object was tracked on the high beam of the CPS-1 radar for a distance of 23° at 90 miles angular range, and an additional 12° while extending the range to 95 miles. At this point the object took a heading, as viewed by the radar operator, of 310° and increased range to 152 miles and disappeared from the high beam. A total of six plots were obtained on the high beam representing seven rotations of the antenna.

3. The antenna sweep rate: The antenna was timed and established to be rotating at 15 seconds per revolution.

4. All of the electronic characteristics are known of the intercepting radar:
- The frequency was 2700 KC for the low beam and 2560 KC for the high beam. The pulse width was 1 IS and the PRF 350.

5. This blip displayed on the face of the Nolan 12" was unusually large and consistently uniform an interesting both to high and low beams. The shape of the blip at all times was 90° to the line of movement, thus establishing the width, as to line of motion, as being much greater than the depth of the object. This condition was notable regardless of line of attack from the radar.

HIGH BEAM:
The high beam operator states the scope presentation showed a blip which would indicate the object as being possibly three times greater than a B-29. Thus the radiating surface was approximately 9 times the radiating surface of a B-29 aircraft. It is accepted in this report that the object was changing elevation and range as will be shown in the radar tracking location, thus placing the unidentified object at several angles from the radar.

The radar high beam has a beam width of -8° at the half-power point; thus at 90 miles, a single target such as a B-29 aircraft, would display a blip approximately 1.26 miles (.8°) wide and that 1/8 pulse should display a blip approximately 300 yards long. Considering the above of the B-29 and the unidentified object and a factor of human error as the 2 miles length of the scope presentation, the 1 1/8 mile blip would only be explained as being caused by a wide formation of possibly several objects flying in a wide formation. The angles of such a formation would be the radar might find the object in a long, latitude and increasing range at a proportional rate sufficient to maintain a fairly constant angular range from the radar site.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ATL Office, D/I FEAF                                    TR-23-52                                    7        11

At the same time the object was losing altitude and increasing range to the radar site, it was also moving in bearing to the West at an apparent horizontal speed of 220 miles per hour. In other words, a rotation, flat in plane, would not necessarily remain in a flat plane while maneuvering a turn, decreasing altitude and increasing range from a spot near the site. In a flight (14,000 feet), a new recorded from the low beam section of the radar equipment bears out the suggested maneuvering of the unidentified object tracked on the high beam by rotating; the nature of the flight as remaining within an shape 90° to line of flight and the reported speed of flight of 3000 miles. As will be pointed out later, the object was probably losing altitude during the period of its plot by the low beam. The reported square turn of as high a "G" rate as suggested in the original report, is not an abrupt turn at all, but a gradual maneuver distributing the pressure of such a turn over a wide area and decreasing the severity of the "G" strain to a probable 2 or 3 "G" figure.

6. The calibration chart from the recent site calibration indicates that high lobe as being very steep and not extending pass 50 miles from the site location. The calibration report does not show how this type of a lobe was determined. This writer believes with this lobe pattern because it is not in accord with a normal lobe pattern as the AN/CPS-1 design enables solid coverage from 2 1/2° to 25° with an "O" tilt. A calculated lobe pattern no shown in the calibration report for site #51 would permit an object to be tracked 152 miles only, which is also evidenced by the high beam subject report inasmuch as the unidentified object was tracked 152 miles on the high beam.

The lobe pattern (Enclosure #3) is shown extending from 3 1/2° to 25°. This setting is based on two things: (1) The antenna line four washers under the rest which is equal to an elevation of 2° from the -1/2° position which is the lowest setting. (2) The antenna is mounted on the top of a mountain 750 feet above sea level. However, the top of the area has a slow break-off, thus a terrace rise of the formula "1.1 2H would tend to affect the beam and lower it possibly 1/2°. By use of this reasoning, the calculated beam pattern was placed at plus 3 1/2°. All of this has been coordinated to establish a reasonably accurate point where the unidentified object left the high beam. The points in space where the object passed between the high beam and the low beam can fairly accurately be calculated and they are as follows: The object left the high beam at an angular range of 152 miles, that is at a point 152 miles from the radar site from the radar site and at an altitude of 19,000 feet. The result of these two findings are: (1) Proof the object was descending altitude at a rate of 3,000 feet a minute, considering a speed of 3,000 miles an hour. (2) The object descended to 19,000 feet in 6.1 1/2 miles, which is a normal slow rate of descent.

7. Other radars operating in the area did not interest the object. Radar sites #52 and #55 both ran a closer to no path of the object than site #51, but neither had a target at or near 1327 3 Oct 51. The Bodo passed over site #5 at approximately the same time initially plotted over site #51.

Radar site #84, located Southwest of site #51 also failed to intercept the high speed object.

8. A search was made among the indigenous personnel in an attempt to find someone who had seen anything whatsoever that could help identify the object. No one was located who had seen anything unusual.

9. The supplementary report by Mr. Antilla of FEAF mentions the possibility that the Bodo was equipped with beacon equipment which was triggered by the GR-1 and Fed back through the system causing the unusual high display of the long run. This was long ago displayed by the writer.

It is difficult to justify this assumption. The Rosebud equipment at the location is not tied into the two Plan 12M Oscilloscopes used for the record plotting. The times are already known to display a tri-wave signal from the object on the highway equipment is not sufficient and the possibility of selecting the exact frequencies of the CPS-1 for the two (2) beams is most unlikely.

10. Heavy CW Interference

The CW frequency utilized on the CW net from Kadena to Itazuke was not usable due to excessive CW interference. Interference from an unknown source is frequently experienced on this net, but I was unable to determine what hours the interference occurs with the greatest amplitude or whether this was a deliberate attempt to block the reporting, not of 13677.5 Oct. 51 in support of the unidentified object.

11. The apparent shift of the target in bearing between the high and low beams is not a true picture. A check the next day found the coordination between the two beams to be off several degrees.

4. Study report - prepared by Mr. Anton, Philco Technical Representative:
SUBJECT: Unidentified Radar Target

1. The undersigned does not agree with the theory outlined in paragraph one of the 1st indorsement, i.o., that a natural object caused the track recorded at Site #51 for the following reasons:

a. The almost constant velocity of the object, as described by the radar operators, and as indicated from inspection of the graphic plot in the enclosure.

b. The shift of target motion from 265 degrees to 355 degrees, an approximately 90 degree change of heading, within a 15 second period.

c. The shift of signal aspect with a change of target direction.

d. The lack of target fluctuation.

e. Although the target was closer to two other sites, it was detected by neither site.

2. While it is entirely possible for a natural object to maintain a state of constant velocity, as indicated in paragraph 1.a. above, it is not considered at all probable that an object subject to natural forces would satisfy the conditions outlined in both paragraphs 1.a. and 1.b., that is, maintenance of a constant high velocity coupled with a rapid change of direction. The only forces of magnitude affecting the velocity and heading of a natural object would be:

a. Initial momentum.
b. Air resistance.
c. Gravity.

It is not seen how a radical shift of heading could be caused by interaction of the above forces, since (a) and (b) are diametrically opposed, and (c) would not affect the heading, but only the path of a free falling object.

3. In view of the above, it must be concluded that the target in question was not of natural origin and was not controlled entirely by natural forces. There are several points in the initial report which offer rather strong substantiation of this theory. An elaboration of these points follows:

a. The change of target heading as indicated in paragraph 1.c. above. This phenomenon is not in normal characteristics of a radar echo. The parametric aspect of a radar echo is a primary function of the vertical and horizontal beam widths of the radar set, and, for a given target, is normally independent of target heading. Normally, a change of target heading will result in a change of radar echo size, but not in a change of echo aspect. A change of echo aspect with target heading, therefore, would be indicative of the presence of a directional or semi-directional echo source. Such a source would normally be one of two forms: (a) a series of curved or bent echoes carried by the object, cut to such a physical length and spaced such that upon proper excitation, a non-radiation or a partial radiation of the radiation within the missile proper. A large

number of studies by various research organizations, including Watson Labs and
the Hughes Aircraft Company, tend to discredit the probability of proposition
(a), so the theory outlined in (b), of the signal originating within the missile,
would seem the more valid of the two. Since there was no apparent change in echo
intensity, or detectable fluctuation in echo size, which would be the case for an
echo returned from a very high speed object, due to the well established frequency
shift or "Doppler Effect", it becomes increasingly apparent that the probable
source of target signal was not due to a radar echo return but was emitted from
the target itself. Assuming that the target carried a self-contained, directional
or semi-directional signal source, which, in view of the above, is not beyond the
range of logic, it then must naturally follow that in an probability the target
was a man-made missile, possibly guided, and equipped with some form of a radio
or radar beacon of the transponder type. That the signal was emitted from a transponder type beacon in further borne out by the fact that the target signal appeared at a definite range and a definite azimuth, and did not cause "rabbit" to
appear on the radar scope, as would have been true in the case of a free-running
or random triggered signal source.

b. With the above in mind, the reason for failure of the other two
radar sites to detect this missile is readily seen. Site #51 was the AN/CPS-1
radar site equipment, which operates in the "S" band, while Sites #52 and #55, which
were both physically closer to the missile, but did not detect it, operate in the
"L" and/or "P" bands. If the missile radiated energy in the "S" band, the radiated signal would, of course, not be detectable by equipment in other "L" or "P"
bands.

4. A further point of consideration is the fact that the AN/CPS-1 height
finder equipment at Site #51 did not detect the target, although this radar set
also operated in the "S" band. There are three probable reasons for this. (a)
The equipment was not operating or was not operating properly. (b) The frequency
of the AN/CPS-1 and the target signal was substantially different. (c) The
missile was at such an altitude as to be out of the range of the equipment. In
the case where the AN/CPS-1 was operating, it is felt that a combination of (b)
and (c) would be the most likely cause of failure to detect the target. Item
(a) in further substantiated by the fact that at approximately close ranges the
target was detected by only the AN/CPS-1 high beam and at longer ranges by only
the low beam.

5. Another item requiring evaluation is the frequency dispersion of the
AN/CPS-1 high and low beam transmitters. The report gives these frequencies as
2/60 megacycles and 2700 megacycles, respectively, or. A frequency dispersion of
160 megacycles. With such a wide difference in operating frequencies existing
between the AN/CPS-1 high and low beams, it becomes apparent that either the missile transmitted a frequency modulated signal or, conceivably, that the high and low beam scopes were being fed a signal from a single narrow
frequency source. The latter case is considered possible during the AN/CPS-1 radar at Site #51 is presently equipped with a "Rosebud" beacon receiver, BC-533/G-13, which, by direction of Headquarters USAF, is tuned to a frequency of 2.07 megacycles, the standard "S" band radar beacon frequency, in use by the USAF and other
American military agencies.

6. A recapitulation of the above data definitely points to the possibility
of the unidentified object reported by Site #51 as being a manufactured missile,
possibly guided, and carrying a radar beacon transponder operating in the "S" band
region.

7. While it is understood that the above assumptions, though based on the
facts discussed, are merely assumptions, it is felt that the possibility of the
