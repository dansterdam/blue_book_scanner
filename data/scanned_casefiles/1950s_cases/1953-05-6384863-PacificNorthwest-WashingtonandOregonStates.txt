AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PROJECT FILE NUMBER: IR T-230-S-53
PAGE: 3

SECTION I (R-27-0) 23 MAY 1953

1. Target, R-27-0, originating in Pacific ADIZ in KB 2325 at 0132 hours. Heading S 140° at 210 knots altitude and ground speed remained same throughout course.
2. At 0139 target was observed on radarscope at 0132? and was unaccountable - he could not get a positive ID on the unknown.
3. Sightings while (2 non-T aircraft vectored in on target) were also unsuccessful.

SECTION II (R-14-0) 23 MAY 1953

1. Target, R-14-0, originating in Pacific ADIZ in KB 1346 at 0132 hours. Heading S 140° with 2,000 feet altitude and estimated 90 knots ground speed.
2. Targets (all at 0302 hours) Captain "A" reported (Pronto Flight) target on scope could not establish positive ID. 
3. CGI Director was Captain D. V. Jansen.
4. Enclosure #3 is a chart containing diagram of the activity.

SECTION III OTHER PERTINENT FACTORS

1. In answer to query, Coast Guard vessels reported saw small as moving objects at 0800 51 (3 miles) also having sharp breaking curves. Visual contact could not be maintained, possibly due to radar trouble, no 15° activity in area for reported large vessel in area which was located.
2. Noah Day could at no time paint the unknown but was painting friendly aircraft.

PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES
1. A holy Moly Project (which was checked for balloon activity) on Monday 25 May 1953 may have involved the sighting of objects near Yakima Washington and Vancouver Washington. The report states that on 25 May 1953 a balloon moved in opposite direction to L 5000 at 05:36.
2. Wind was from NE at 5,000 feet, 20 knots.
3. Coast Guard Radars operation at Westport, Washington reported receiving primary targets on 500 ft. chart at 2330 and 2345 which were unidentified. These could not be identified and may have been related to the balloon move.
4. Port Hardy Radio Range Station, Vancouver Island, BC reported that they had been monitoring 500 KC. The Coast Guard radio operator reported that they had detected interference to this frequency which could be utilized for homing to effect a recovery.

5. Major Denman, Operations Officer, 317th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, was made out in a 1-29 and reported that he had made contact with numerous fishing boats in the area which were painted by the AF Interceptors, the B-25 and by PGH.

SECTION IV DISCUSSION
1. A study of the alingment of plots provided by station P-57 on these tracks and the report from personnel at the station that the blips looked unusual led to the conclusion that the blips/plots were caused by some considerable distance from the radar station. Considering that the sea was running in a direction that would result in the tracking of sea returns, the conclusion was that a target a considerable distance from the station was being tracked and that the four returns plotting to the ground station would be a false return and a range of targets beyond the radar station would be obtained.

There is no photograph in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing a report from the 25th Air Division (Defense) related to an incident where a station called F-4h was unable to pick up certain tracks.

The text of the document is as follows:

"FROM: 25th AIR DIVISION (Def)
TO: DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, USAF
SUBJECT: UNCLASSIFIED AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

1. The fact that station F-4h was unable to pick up these tracks when they were within the surveillance capability of that station reflects the deterioration of the monitoring equipment at that station. This condition reflects the inability of the Air Force to properly monitor air traffic and numerous fishing boats and some ocean vessels.

2. A close watch toward ocean-going vessels from Tatocush Island (near Neah Bay?) appeared to be a matter between 1500 and 1700 feet from the station, yet the tracking equipment was unable to pick up the tracks. This could indicate that the station's equipment is in need of repair and adjustment. It is noted that F-4h is manned by personnel from WSAF, who have been charged with the development of ground and universal radar units and may develop and blink may appear on scope when actually no aircraft object is present.

3. It is further noted that site F-4h was below the level of the surrounding terrain and that the equipment installation was made during the winter conditions, which may have a bearing on the null area for F-4h at the present altitude setting. More detailed examination may be required.

4. The Westport Coast Guard station is located at AD 2291. The unknown tracks are within 50-75 miles of that station. The Coast Guard Headquarters at Seattle has been notified of this traffic and stated that they have not been able to identify any unusual vessel activity on their 500 kc marine monitor station's equipment. The Coast Guard has stated that they will continue monitoring the situation and will attempt to identify or track any vessels known to be in vicinity of tracks as reported on the CCG monitor station's equipment.

SECTION V - CONCLUSION 
1. This Headquarters is unable to further evaluate these tracks.
2. No firm conclusions can be reached as to identity of subject tracks."

STATEMENT

At approximately 0l:32 hours (about 1:32 am) were sighted on the north-south radar of the Ground Observer Corps station at Grant's Pass, Oregon, a target of moderate intensity. The target was followed by Shelton in the Radar Operation Room for approximately 8 minutes when it faded from the radar screen. It was estimated that the target covered a distance of approximately 20 to 25 miles during this time.

The target reappeared on the radar screen about 10 minutes later and was followed for an additional 15 minutes. At times the target was lost and then regained, leaving the impression that it was manuvering or changing altitude very rapidly. Subsequent observation from the station indicated that the target was apparently off the southwest at an estimated azimuth of 210 degrees to 220 degrees and appeared to be at a relatively high altitude.

The operator stated that the target seemed to be traveling at a speed that appeared to be greater than that of any known aircraft. The radar set was functioning properly and was checked thoroughly during the time of observation. The operator of the radar set stated that he had never seen anything like it before.

The incident was reported promptly through channels, and all pertinent information was forwarded to the Air Defense Command. The radar data and visual observation was the only report received from this area covering this incident.

It was noon and we were watching the ground return as we started descending. The ground return was very sharp and distinct. After passing the ground return, a continuing light was ground return done. There are masses called ground mass returning, passing the ground plane, about 5-600 yards up. Suddenly, a light became apparent. It was rapidly maintaining about 1100 - 1200 knots, the individual lights appeared distinct, they were also up and down, and they appeared to be slowing down. They were not coming together, but spread out, about 50-100 knots. There is one light that took a look at, overtake over 100 knots. We then went into a hard right turn and headed back, looking at these lights. They appeared to be real, approximately HOD - 500 yards. We flew through this around and looked at several of these objects. We also made another descending pass of this item and some pictures were taken. The item or items were above the clouds. AF54-375
