WAIKIKI, HAWAII
June 13, 1959

Evaluation: Sun striking the lens, possibly with water droplets on the front element, is the most reasonable explanation for the image.
The series of less apparent spots ranging across the frame is an additional reason to suspect sun flare.

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)                16 November 1960

TO: ATIC (AFOIN-IHGN)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. A Boeing Airplane Company employee, Mr. [redacted], brought the
enclosed color slide to my attention on 15 Nov 60. I projected the slide
to the largest magnification possible at this facility and in my opinion
the slide is a double exposure (possible on an Argus C-3) of a light bulb
and shadow. In accord with AFR 200-2, I am submitting the slide and
information relative to the picture and if additional information is required,
please contact Mr. [redacted] as soon as possible. As some of the information requested
by AFR 200-2 is unknown, the specified format could not be followed.

2. Camera: Argus C-3.
    b. Film: Kodacolor.
    c. Date picture taken: 18 June 1959.
    d. Date picture developed (commercially): February 1960.
    e. Time picture taken: 14:00.
    f. Place: Waikiki Beach, Hawaii.
    g. Name: [redacted], Bellevue, Washington.

2. According to Mr. [redacted], he was in the U.S. Navy in June of 1959 and was a
crew member of the U.S.S. Pine Island AV-12. He was on liberty on 18 June
and spent the entire day on shore taking two rolls of film. After returning
to the ship, he put the undeveloped rolls of film away and did not have them
developed until he was discharged from the Navy in January 1960. He noticed
the "spot" when he received the slides, but did not know what to do about it
until he was employed by Boeing Airplane Company and was referred to my office.

3. Mr. [redacted] disclaims any knowledge of a double exposure and did not reload
his camera when a light surge. He was on the beach at the time he was taking

does not develop pictures himself and has been taking pictures about ten

TO: AFCIN-432x

1. The object referred to as a UFO could most probably be
the result of one of two conditions: Reflection from a glass
glass window through which the scene was photographed or,
the photograph is a double exposure. The fact that the
color balance is quite good tends to favor the possibility
of reflections, of which there are a number scattered across
the format, rather than a double exposure.

2. To further exploit this photography it will be necessary
to find out if the scene was in fact photographed through a
glass window and to obtain the original Kodacolor
negative.

1.   The photograph was taken outside on the beach and, according to information, none of the pictures on the roll of film were taken inside. He also was outside when the roll of film was inserted and spent the entire day on the beaches taking pictures.

2.   He is reluctant to part with the original Koda color negative and unless it is absolutely necessary would prefer not to send it. However, if he can be guaranteed that it will be returned to him, he would be willing to forward it as requested.

1. The 35mm color transparency received for examination is Kodacolor rather than Kodacolor as stated by Mr. Sigel.

2. The so-called "spot" could have been caused by the following, in order of probability:
a. Specular reflection or refraction
b. Reflection from a glass window
c. Double exposure
d. Processing flaws.

3. Sun striking the lens, possibly with water droplets on the front element, is the most reasonable explanation for the image. The series of loss apparent spots ranging across the frame is an additional reason to suspect sun flare.

1. The negatives of the picture taken by Mr. [redacted] on 18 June 1959 at Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, has been analyzed by ATIC and the alleged object determined to be probably due to sun striking the lens, possibly with vapor droplets on the front element. The series of less apparent spots ranging across the frame is an additional reason to suspect sun flare.

2. It is requested that when you next contact Mr. [redacted] you express our appreciation for his interest in this matter.

3. Mr. [redacted] original negative is attached in order that you may return it to him.
