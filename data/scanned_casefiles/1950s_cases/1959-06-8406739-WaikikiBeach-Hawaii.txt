COMMENTS: At approximately 1830 on 6-8-59 at Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, a local resident reported seeing a round, white, luminous object in the sky that hovered for about 5 minutes before moving diagonally to the left and out of sight. The object was about the size of a baseball and gave off a steady glow. No sound was heard. The weather was clear and the object was visible against a clear sky.

WAIKIKI, HAWAII
JUNE 15, 1959

Evaluation: Sun striking the lens, possibly with water droplets on the lens element, is the most reasonable explanation for the image. The series of lenslike spots ranging across the frame is an additional reason to support sun flares.

3. According to the informant, he was in the U.S. Navy in June of 1959 and was a crew member aboard a ship while on liberty for the day on shore taking two rolls of film. After returning to the ship, he developed the rolls of film. As for results, the slides did show a disc-shaped object and 150 ft. have them, but did not know what to do about it until he was employed by AIRLTIAN COMPANY and was referred to my office.
4. Mr.      disclaiming any knowledge of a double exposure and did not relate his camera ever a light catcher. He was on the beach at the time he was taking the pictures.

The color slide referred to as a UFO could most probably be the normal configuration of one of two conditions reported from time to time. The possibility of this color balance is such that it seems to favor the probability of a glint or reflection. The edge that shows slightly blurred tends to confirm this view. To further exploit this photography it will be necessary to take out 18 the frame and use a macro lens window and try to obtain the original Kodak color balance.

2. ACTION:  
No Change.

The image contains a photograph that appears to be redacted or obscured. The text in the document appears to be a report from the ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. It mentions that the original photographic negative was not sent and that the individual is reluctant to part with the original negative. 

The text in the document is as follows:

ATIC ARDC-4822, 15 Dec 60
2nd Ind
ATIC ARDC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
TO: ATIC (ARDC-4822), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Per your request the pictures on the roll of 35mm were taken inside the object as he could not get the entire object on the film and stated it was dark grey in color. He is reluctant to part with the original Kodak color negative as he states that upon his death it will be destroyed. However, if he can be guaranteed that it will be returned to him, he would be willing to forward it.

2. In view of the foregoing it is recommended that the original Kodak color negative be obtained, if possible, for further analysis. If he does permit the negative to be obtained, it is requested that it be returned to him as soon as the analysis is completed.

1. The 35mm color transparency received for examination is inconclusive rather than diagnostic.

2. The so-called "spot" could have been caused by the following:
a. Specular reflection or refraction
b. Reflection from a glass window
c. Double exposure
d. Developing flaws.

3. The sun striking the lens, possibly with water droplets on the lens, is the most reasonable explanation for the "spot". The fact that the image is an additional reason to suspect sun "flare".
