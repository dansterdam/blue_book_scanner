time of sighting, that visibility was ten (10) times and that both sources admitted being poor judges of altitude distances, that the sighting could possibly have been a local aircraft.

Note: After this report had been prepared, the preparing MOC heard a newscast over the local radio station (station WJRJ). The newscaster stated that a Tyndall pilot had contacted the Panama City News Herald office (a local newspaper publication) stating that he, the pilot, had observed a large flock of birds just shortly before 1200 hours 9 March 1954, in the vicinity of this airbase. The observation was made from an aircraft. This office contacted the radio station and the News Herald office in an effort to obtain the pilot's name, however neither of the above had any permanent record.

OFFICE, TYNDALL AFB, FLORIDA. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE PREPARING NCO THAT SINCE THERE WERE TWENTY SIX (26) AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING, THAT VISIBILITY WAS TEN (10) MILES AND THAT BOTH SOURCES ADMITTED BEING POOR JUDGES OF ALTITUDE DISTANCES, THAT THE SIGHTING COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN A LOCAL AIRCRAFT.

NOTE: AFTER THIS MSG HAD BEEN PREPARED, THE PREPARING NCO HEARD A NEWSCAST OVER THE LOCAL RADIO STATION. THE NEWSCASTER STATED THAT A TYNDALL PILOT HAD CONTACTED THE PANAMA CITY NEWS HERALD OFFICE, STATING THAT (THE PILOT) HAD OBSERVED A LARGE FLOCK OF BIRDS JUST SHORTLY BEFORE 1200 HRS 8 MAR 54, IN THE VICINITY OF THIS AIRBASE. THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE FROM AN AIRCRAFT. THIS OFFICE CONTACTED THE RADIO STATION AND THE NEWS HERALD OFFICE IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN THE PILOTS NAME, HOWEVER NEITHER OF THE ABOVE HAD ANY PERMANENT RECORD.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

At approximately 11:30 AM on 8 March 1954, Mrs. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted], housewives and dependents of military personnel, while driving near Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida, observed an unidentified flying object. The object as described by both observers was first sighted to the east, moving to Talbot Ridge, SSP to SSP SE. Both observers stated that the object was silver in color, the character also stated that the object shape was circular and moved very fast. The object was observed for five (5) minutes and remained in sight for the entire period of observation. Both women were rather reluctant to discuss the incident, since they had already heard of Flying Saucer stories, but now believe that the possibility exists.

1. Sketch of various shapes in which the object was observed and color in which it appeared, so provided by Mrs. [redacted]

(1) Description of the object:
(a) Both sources stated that the object changed shape every few seconds. When first observed it had a cigar shape appearance, then changed to a delta wing appearance, and when last observed it had a round, flat appearance.

(b) In size it appeared to both observers to be approximately thirty-five (35) inches in diameter. This figure was arrived at by comparing an ordinary beach ball held at arm length from the observers.

(c) The color of the object varied as the object changed appearance. Both sources state that during the first and second observations the object was white, with tinges of silver. Then last observed, in round, flat shape, it was pinkish-grey in color.

(d) Number - negative.
(e) Position - negative.
(f) Discernible features - negative.
(g) Well, wall, or exhaust - negative.
(h) Sound - negative.
(i) Pertinent or unusual features - negative.

(i) Description of course of object:
(a) Mrs. [redacted] first observed the object, calling Mrs. [redacted] attention to it. Mrs. [redacted] stated that it appeared as a white cloud breaking up. It then faded away and reappeared a few minutes later.

(b) When first observed the angle of elevation was 30° at 90° azimuth.
