AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most of the top header information is illegible or blacked out]

SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCER IN UNIDENTIFIED STATUS

The following is a report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object:

[Several lines of text are partially illegible]

The observer was riding in a car with a male companion who did not see the object as an odd thing to take his eyes off the road.

The observer stated that she saw a similar object over Phoenix, Arizona, in 1952. This object remained in sight long enough for her to bring out a camera but no picture was taken. She watched the object or similar object.

The observer is an apartment house owner and operator about fifty (50) years of age.

A similar sighting was reported on the base over radio station KGKL, San Antonio, Texas, on the evening of 3 August 1954. [Remainder of paragraph partially obscured]

REPORTING OF INFORMATION ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

SUMMARY (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final paragraph. List indications of lower left. Despatch of report on AF Form 118A)

The following is a report of the sighting of an unidentified flying
object in the San Antonio Area.

The first object was sighted by the sources wife while at his residence
at San Antonio, Texas. The sources wife was in bed and noticed the object in the sky through the window. The
object remained in view for approximately 25 seconds. It appeared as a bright almost white light which turned into a light red before the object
diminished. Sources wife called for him to come into the room but by the
time source arrived, the object had disappeared. Source and his wife
continued to watch the sky and approximately ten (10) minutes later a similar
object appeared in approximately the same position as the first. The
characteristics of the second object were the same as the first. It passed
through a 70 to 75 degree arc in 15 seconds, appearing from the north east
and traveling to the south west.

The source is an Intelligence Instructor with the USAF Pre-Flight School
at this station. While stationed at White Sands, New Mexico, he had heard
numerous stories about "Flying Saucers".

Local Man Sees Mysterious Object
In Nighttime Skies Over This Area

"It had a reddish tinge about the color of the planet Mars," said Frank Saunders, who lives at Roanoke Motor Court, said the object did not blink nor did it make a sound that he could hear.

"It was faster than an airplane but slower than any meteor I've ever seen," Saunders told Radio Station WCBF's news department shortly after the occurrence.

He said he spotted it in the East, that it moved from East to West past the zenith, then turned South to about what he called "11 o'clock", then West again and he lost sight of it. He had it under observation for about two minutes.

He said that as he observed it, it moved "about one inch per second" in his visibility.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 9 AUGUST 1954

SOURCE OF INFORMATION: [REDACTED]
PREPARING OFFICER: VERNON R SHIMMER, CAPT, USAF
WING OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER

SUBJECT: REPORTING OF INFORMATION ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

SUMMARY:
The following is a report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object in San Antonio, Texas.

The object was sighted while the observer was riding in an automobile toward San Antonio, Texas, on the Gonzales Road approximately ten (10) miles out from the city. The object, sighted was approximately nine (9) feet in diameter or possibly larger. It was constructed of some shiny metal, like aluminum, so bright that the observer could not look at your object. The object was in view for about three (3) minutes and moved in the direction of Lackland Air Force Base. It moved at a very high rate of speed and was lost from view in the clouds. The observer estimates the time of the sighting to be 1030 hours, 3 August 1954.

The observer was riding in a car with a male companion who did not see the object as he did not with to open his eyes on the road.

The observer stated that she saw a similar object over Phoenix, Arizona in 1950. This object remained in sight long enough for her to hang out a complete line of washing. Since then she has always watched the sky for similar objects.

The observer is an apartment house owner and operator about fifty (50) years of age.

A similar sighting was reported on the news over radio station KONO, San Antonio, Texas, on the evening of 8 August 1954. A phone call to the station revealed that the object was sighted by two (2) girls, Miss M, age 15, and Miss C, age 11. The object was sighted at [remainder of text cut off]
