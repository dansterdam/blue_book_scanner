The reliability and credibility of the witness is considered to be good.
CONCLUSIGN: That this incident be filed as an "UNID't1FTTZD FLYING OBJECT" in accordance with the standard procedure. No further investigation appears warranted.

This document does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a report titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from the U.S. Air Force, covering an unidentified flying object sighting near San Antonio, Texas on August 19, 1954.

The text in the document is as follows:

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: U.S.A.
AGENCY OR UNIT: AIR INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
SUBJECT: REPORTING OF INFORMATION ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
SUMMARY (Give concise summary of report. Give significance in final evaluation paragraph. If continuation of previous report, refer to previous report number and date.)
The objective is a report of the observation of an unidentified flying object in the San Antonio, Texas area. 
The object was sighted while the observer was riding in an automobile toward San Antonio, Texas, on the Dennis Hope Expressway. The object was flying at an elevation of approximately ten (10) miles and was traveling toward the east at a very high rate of speed, estimated visually to be from (2) to (5) times the speed of a jet plane at that elevation. The object was approximately oval-shaped, giving the appearance of a half-circle, the trailing edge being more blunt than the leading edge. The color of the object appeared to be white or chrome. It was observed for approximately ten (10) seconds at the time of the sighting to be 1030 hours, 19 August 1954.
The observer was unable to determine the exact size of the object, but estimated the object as he did not wish to make his name known and in 1950: the object's silhouette was found to be eight (8) feet long and two (2) feet thick. This object's silhouette was shown to several people in 1950. Since then there have been no further sightings of similar objects.
The observer is a department house owner and operator about fifty (50) years of age.
A familiar sighting was reported on the news over radio station WOAI, San Antonio, Texas, on the night of the observation. The radio station revealed that the object was sighted by two (2) people, a man and a woman, and the object was described as being about fifteen (15) feet long.
