Text from the document:

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SUMMARY
SUMMARY AND EXHIBIT SHEET

DATE OF INCIDENT: 7 April 1958
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: Gas pumps at an Oil Ststion,Canton,Austinburg,Ohio
TIME: 0045 Z (GMT)

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: Two men, 66 and 30 years old, reported seeing a rectangular-shaped object, bright white in color, that hovered over the gas pumps for several minutes. The object was observed to be about 25 feet long and 10 feet high. It made no sound and did not move until it suddenly shot upwards at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The witnesses stated the object was the size of a "small house trailer" and was observed at a distance of about 150 yards.

INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS: The witnesses were interviewed separately and their accounts were consistent. Statements were obtained from the witnesses and the report was forwarded to Project Blue Book.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None.

FINAL ATIC EVALUATION: Astronomical (Possibly a Satellite). Although several witnesses observed the object, the description indicates it was probably a satellite or some other natural phenomenon and did not represent an actual "flying saucer."

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, specifically a report regarding a telephone conversation with a C.O. Canton Filter Center, Ohio on April 9, 1958.

The text output from the document is as follows:

MEMO FOR FILE

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation With C.O. Canton Filter Center, Ohio.
Lt. Weaver, 2d Air Division, Project Glendalk 3-7-58, to Canton, Ohio Incident, 7 April 1958

1. Lt. Weaver checked his chief GOC operator at Austinburg, Ohio regarding the Homesick HOO case reported in TR 58-3-275. No knowledge on their part.

2. Lt. Weaver called Brookfield ABS, 626/ADAXON, talked to C.O. Capt. Powell, who checked his records. No record of anyone reporting a UFO.

3. However, when asked about the "Homesick HOO" case, Capt. Powell stated that 562-nd AISS in a swamp north of Austinburg, Capt. Powell stated, that 662-nd had tracked and identified a meteor trail. Further, this was confirmed by a Cleveland TV Station: Meteor passed over the area - and disappeared towards Canada. (Not observed directly as they fall near their locality; an optical illusion proven for over 12 years of UFO Project evidence.)
