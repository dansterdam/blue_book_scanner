MEMO FOR FILE

9 April 1958

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation With C.O., Canton Filter Center, Ohio, 
Lt. J. E. Weaver, Phone: Glendale 3-7676, re Canton, Ohio Incident, 
7 April 1958

1. Lt. Weaver checked his chief GOC operator at Austinburg, Ohio 
regarding the housewife reporting the UFO as stated in TT Msg 1WR-276. 
No knowledge of, or location of Source. No UFO reported to that GOC post.

2. Lt. Weaver called Brookfield AFS, 662/ACWRON, talked to C. O. 
Capt. Povell, who checked his records. No record of anyone reporting a UFO.

3. However, when asked about the "object" reported to have fallen 
in a swamp north of Austinburg, Capt. Povell stated that 662nd radar 
picked up, tracked and identified a meteor trail. Further, this was 
confirmed by a Cleveland TV Station: Meteor passed over the area - and 
disappeared somewhere in Canada. (Most observers reporting bodies, fire-
balls, parachutes generally state that they fall near locality; an 
optical illusion proven for over 12 years of UFO Projects existence.)
