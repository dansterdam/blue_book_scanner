Hobart Ind
Feb 15 - 1965

Scientist in Charge of outer space objects.
Dear Sir:

On 1955 Aug 7th about 11 A.M., we in our neighborhood saw a ball-silver color high in the air. I could not keep it in view with my binoculars until I sat in a chair and braced my arms so they could not move. Then when I was firmly braced and again contracted the object this is what I saw and why I couldn't keep it in view before; binoculars 3 marked 7 x 3½ 7°10'.

Here is the text from the document:

back and forth the ball went always
going to the outside of my view and
criss cross - going completely around
the circle of vision in the binoculars
never stationary back and forth.

What kind of an object would
this be and what used for.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Hobart 3½2

The document also contains a hand-drawn circular diagram with intersecting lines dividing the circle into segments.

Major Hector Quintanilla

Box 4484
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

Enclosed is a letter which Dr. Hynek received quite some time ago, but which I have just resurrected from the mound on the desk. On a note attached to this letter, Dr. Hynek suggests that it might have been a weather balloon, but he can come to no conclusions as duration, apparent size, etc. not given.

Also enclosed is a copy of the letter which I sent to Mrs. [redacted].

Happy identifying!

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Dear Mrs.

Thank you for your letter of 15 February 1965. Dr. Hynek is now in Las Cruces, New Mexico working at our southwestern observatory, but he has asked that I forward your letter to the Air Force. I am certain that they will be able to clarify your sighting.

Sincerely yours,

Katherine R. Foss
Secretary to the Director
