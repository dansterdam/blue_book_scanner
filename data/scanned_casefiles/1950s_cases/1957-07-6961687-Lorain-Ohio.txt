GENTLEMEN:

ON THE ADVICE OF MR. WEBBER, ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR CORP IN
THIS CITY, I AM REPORTING THE UNUSUAL OBJECTS OBSERVED AT
5:15 A.M. TODAY BY MY HUSBAND, 24 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND
MYSELF.

OUR HOME IS SITUATED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF EAST ERIE AVENUE
WHICH PARALLELS LAKE ERIE. OUR DAUGHTER HAPPENED TO LOOK
OUT OVER THE LAKE AND NOTICED THREE VERY BRILLIANT STARS
IN THE NORTHEAST. SHE THEN NOTICED THEY WEREN'T STARS FOR
THEY WERE MOVING. SHE AWAKENED ME AND ABOUT THEN, THE
FOURTH POPPED INTO VIEW FROM BEHIND A ROW OF TREES ON THE
LAKE BANK. I AWAKENED MY HUSBAND FOR I KNEW HE WOULDN'T
BELIEVE OUR STORY--A SCRIPT OF HIS FIRST WAKING HOURS
WATCHED THEM UNTIL THEY PASSED OVER OUR HOME HEADING SOUTH
WEST.

AN ACCURATE TIME CHECK COULD BE MADE FOR A PLANE FROM
CLEVELAND HOPKINS AIRPORT WAS PASSING OVER OUR HOUSE HEADS
NORTHWEST.

WHAT DID WE SEE? FOUR DAZZLING WHITE LIGHTS, EXCEEDINGLY
HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH'S SURFACE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASEBALL
AND TRAVELING IN THE FOLLOWING POSITION:

BECAUSE WE ARE IN BUSINESS HERE AND ALSO BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF HAVING "FLIPPED", WHEN I CALLED OUR LOCAL PAPER TO INQUIRE WHOM TO CONTACT, I DID NOT GIVE MY NAME NOR DID I GIVE IT TO MR. PLEASE UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES REVEAL IT. I'VE READ FAR TOO MUCH ABOUT "HOAX, PUBLICITY SEEKERS, ETC." I WANT NO PART OF THE NOTORIETY. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE SAW.

OUR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON IS SURE THEY WERE "FLYING SAUCERS" AND HOPES THEY LAND IN OUR FRONT YARD THEIR NEXT TRIP OVER.

I WILL GREATLY APPRECIATE HEARING FROM YOU.

SINCERELY,

[Signature location blacked out]
LORAIN, OHIO
