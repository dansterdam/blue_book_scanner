Summary: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List enclosures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112--Part 11.)

The following is a report from Capt. Donald K. Slayton, AO-677 597, of the 133rd Maintenance Squadron, 133rd Fighter-Interceptor Wing.

This report concerns a three (3) to four (4) minute observation of an unidentified object, while on a test flight in an F-51 aircraft, on 12 December 1951.

Visibility on this day was exceptionally good. Observation was at 2450 on 12 December 1951. Pilot was flying at 10,000'. Unidentified object was at all times below the F-51 aircraft. Due to the fact that the aircraft was at 10,000', no corrected estimation of distance was obtained.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From (Agency): Wg Aircraft, 133rd FIW
St. Paul, Minnesota

Report No. 3-51    Page 1 of Pages

(1) At 2150Z on 12 December 1951, Capt. Donald K. Slayton, observed an unidentified object five (5) miles southwest of Hastings, Minnesota. Capt. Slayton was cruising at 10,000', and had just pulled out of a loop and was heading back towards Wold-Chamberlain Airfield, when he first spotted a white object about one (1) mile out and 1,000' below his left wing tip.

(2) When the object was first spotted it appeared to resemble a kite, but the pilot assumed a kite would not normally be at this altitude. When the second observation was made, the object was almost with and below the left wing tip and resembled a round white object. The rate of closure seemed exceptionally fast, but at this position the pilot assumed the object was a weather wind balloon riding down-wind. It appeared perfectly round, 18" to 21" in diameter, white or silver. The object gave an illusion of spinning, which at this stage was attributed by Capt. Slayton, to light diffusion.

(3) At point No (1), pilot first observed object, he made a left 180° turn which should have brought him straight into the object at point (2). At point (3) the object began to turn to the left and seemed to gain speed rapidly. The pilot was turned with the object at about a 300 left bank. It was at this point the pilot became aware the object was not floating in space, but rather had accelerating and maneuvering abilities.

(4) The pilot kept closing in until he was at about an assumed distance of 500 ft. At point (4) (5) (II), at these points the object appeared to be two classes of a round, spinning at a rapid rate.

(5) The object or objects gained speed from points (3) - (II) at a very rapid rate, and took on the appearance of a single object, and then gained speed very rapidly leaving point (II) and approaching point (III). Rotational effect appeared to be in a counter-clockwise direction at all times.

(6) Pilot when approaching point (4) - (III) started to turn with object at about a 270° left turn, the object picking up speed at all times. At point (4) - (III) the pilot had an estimated speed of about 280 mph. The pilot assumes the speed of the object at this point was about 380 or 400 mph.

(7) The pilot started to straighten out then snap back into position at point (5) when pilot went back into turn, he lost sight of object at point (7Y).
