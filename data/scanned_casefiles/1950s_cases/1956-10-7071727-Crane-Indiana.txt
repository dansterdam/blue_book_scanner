circular and about fort ,}’ (40) feet in diameter. The witness reports
stopping for approximately 30 _seconds to view the object, which left,
aQgh ir  the Depot alt & speed comparable to that of & shooting star.
Tie witness reports that the sky was clear, no other aircraft were in

Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects, report of investigation of

Ref: (a) OPNAV P34D INET 3620,14 did 2 Feb 1956

1. Subject report has been complied in accordance with reference (a).

2. On the night of 27 October 1956, six persons reported seeing an 
unidentified flying object from Crane Village, which is located on the
western edge of the Depot, and one person reported seeing such an object 
from the Administration Building, which is located in the center of the 
Depot. Upon subsequent investigation one other person reported that he 
had on the night of 27 October seen from Crane Village an object whose 
location and description matched that given by the other witnesses, which 
object he had considered to be a star and had not reported.

3. One of the Crane Village witnesses upon being questioned, related that 
the object was seen to the northwest at an elevation of 300 or a little 
less; that it was impossible to estimate the distance or height or size 
of the object; that it was a luminous object which changed colors like a 
prism, exhibits primary colors; that it did not give off a steady light, 
but glittered or twinkled; that it was small enough to be a star, and was 
not seen to move around; that it was only sighted by this witness one time, 
and disappeared when he looked for it later. This witness said that he had 
seen stars or celestial bodies behave this way under frosty atmospheric 
conditions. He said that the colors seen were red, blue, and yellow, and 
that the object did not move about any more than normal for a celestial body, 
This witness volunteered the opinion that the object was a star or a celestial body.

4. The name of the witness mentioned in paragraph 3 is
                          . He is employed as a police geek in the Securigepartment 
of NAD Crane.

5. Five Crane Village witnesses stated that they saw an object in the 
eastern sky at approximately 2000 on 27 October which was blinking and 
slightly changing in color.

The other four witnesses are-HAO Crane Security police guards.

* said that the object was, lie believed, a star.' He said
that the night was extra clear and the star very bright; that it glimmered and looked as if it was changing colors; and that he has since checked the same area, found the star, and been told that it is the planet Mars.
8. The Crane Village witness who did not at the time of sighting it report the object as an unidentified flying object stated that on 27 October at about 2030 he had been in the Crane area and had noticed the brightness of this star and that it had a tendency to change colors and had remarked to his companions that that was no doubt the flying saucers that some of the people had been seeing. This witness stated that he was familiar with the planet of Mars and he definitely was positive that that was the object he saw.

```
1B (8) -AD:ban 
22 November 1956

13. This report was prepared from information submitted by ✓ Depot Criminal Investigator, interrogation of witnesses, and log entries, by the Legal Officer attached to the Depot whose comments and preliminary analysis of possible causes of the sightings are as follows:

a. The object seen by the five Crane Village witnesses and by the Chief of Police to the East was in all probability the planet Mars or some other celestial body.

b. The object seen from the Administration Building by Chief to the Northwest was probably a celestial body and perhaps the same one seen by Mr.

c. The object seen from 1850 to 1920 to the Northeast was probably a celestial body and perhaps the same one seen by the five Crane Village witnesses.

1!. The descriptions given by the witnesses of all of these objects are consistent with the hypothesis that the objects were celestial bodies. My conjecture is that they were regarded as unidentified flying objects because of the sudden cold snap which probably caused supersaturation of the air with resulting in condensation around the dust particles, thereby removing them and rendering visible the full color and brilliance of celestial bodies, and also perhaps set up unusual degrees of variation in air density which increased the twinkling effect.
