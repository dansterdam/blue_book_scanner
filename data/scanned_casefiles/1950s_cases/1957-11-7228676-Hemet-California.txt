I drive at highway am to corner near
no I don't know if what I was
Could this have been a plane?
It was less than a mile from where I was

Looked to be 4 long and
about 13 wide slightly
tapered on front
Color of flame

Below the top of the hills, I would
say what turned look like 1/3 of
the way from sky line
at approximately 5:30
Tuesday evening as I was coming home I was
about half way on the straight
stretch near the north
I was going S. toward almost
the object was splendid along
in clear flight and the flame colored
bright or tail was not deflected at all
but it was not clear at a great
apparent as it was all so I don't think it could
have risen and cleared the hills so
it was going a distinct line between the light part
There was a distinct line between the flame colored part
and the flame color and out top of page
