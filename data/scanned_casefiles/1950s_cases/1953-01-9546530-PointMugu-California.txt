NAUTICAL MILES

For convenience in converting distances expressed in statute miles to their equivalents in nautical miles, and vice versa, the table below has been prepared. The United States nautical mile has been used for the table.

The United States nautical mile is defined as equal to one-sixtieth of a degree (one minute) of a great circle on a sphere whose surface is equal to the surface of the earth. The value of a nautical mile is calculated on this basis as 1853.25 meters or 6080.20 feet. Since the common or statute mile is equal to 5280 feet, one nautical mile equals approximately 1.152 statute miles, and one statute mile equals approximately 0.868 nautical mile. For quick calculation the nautical mile may be considered approximately one-seventh longer than the statute mile, and the statute mile approximately one-eighth shorter than the nautical mile.

In the lower margins of the sectional charts is provided a convenient conversion scale by which values in statute miles may be readily converted to nautical miles and vice versa. Distances expressed in either unit may thus be scaled directly on the charts.

The length of one minute of latitude measured along a meridian on the surface of the earth at latitude 48°15' is equal to a United States nautical mile. North or south of 48°15' the length of a minute is slightly longer or shorter, since the earth is not a perfect sphere. However, for practical purposes, the nautical mile is considered equivalent to a minute of latitude at any point on the earth's surface. Therefore, the one-minute subdivisions of the meridian lines on the face of charts may also be used for scaling distances.

The knot is a unit of speed only. One knot is equal to one nautical mile per hour; as, when an aircraft is traveling 200 nautical miles per hour, its speed is 200 knots.

SEARCH AND RESCUE

Search and Rescue Service is a life saving service provided through the combined efforts of the CAA, Air Force, and Coast Guard who are assisted by other organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Sheriff Air Patrol, State Police, and such other agencies as may be available. It provides search, survival aid, and rescue of personnel of missing or crashed aircraft.

All you need to remember to obtain this valuable protection is:
1. File a Flight Plan with a CAA Airway Communications Station in person or by telephone or radio.
2. File an Arrival Report.
3. If you land at a location other than intended destination, report the landing to the nearest CAA Communications Station.
4. If you land enroute and are delayed more than an hour, report this information to the nearest communications station.
-Remember that if you fail to report within one hour after your E.T.A., a search will be started to locate you. If you fail to report within three hours after your E.T.A., the full facilities of the Search and Rescue Service will be activated.

Searches are expensive, they inconvenience other people, and on numerous occasions the lives of other pilots are sacrificed when searching for lost or overdue pilots. SO, FILE AN ARRIVAL REPORT!

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Lay out symbols by using strips of fabric or parachutes, pieces of wood, stones, or any available material.
2. Provide as much color contrast as possible between material used for symbols and background against which symbols are exposed.
3. Symbols should be at least 10 feet high or larger, if possible. Care should be taken to lay out symbols exactly as shown to avoid confusion with other symbols.
4. In addition to using symbols, every effort is to be made to attract attention by means of radio, flares, smoke, or other available means.
5. When ground is covered with snow, signals can be made by dragging, shoveling or tramping the snow. The depressed areas forming the symbols will appear to be black from the air.
6. Pilot should acknowledge message by rocking wings from side to side.

There is an illustration rather than a photograph on the page. The illustration is a compass-like diagram showing cruising altitudes based on magnetic courses, designated for even and odd thousands of feet in various directions.

Here is the OCR-transcribed text from the document:

---

**CRUISING ALTITUDES**

**CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES** During VFR conditions aircraft at altitudes of 3000 feet or more above the surface within control zones and control areas, including controlled airways, must be flown at odd or even 1000-foot levels appropriate to the direction of flight. "Odd" and "Even" indicators are shown on Coast and Geodetic Survey Radio Facility Charts. Under IFR conditions within control zones and control areas, indicating controlled airways, altitudes will be flown in accordance with ATC clearances.

The following rules will govern the altitudes at which aircraft shall fly when making VFR flights along controlled civil airways:

Green and Red Airways and Even-numbered VOR Airways
Eastbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet.)
Westbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet.)

Amber and Blue Airways and Odd-numbered VOR Airways
Northbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet.)
Southbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet.)

The following rules will apply on segments where color airways and VOR airways overlap:
Where a color airway coincides with a VOR airway, the ODD or EVEN rule for the appropriate color airways will apply.
Where no color airway is involved and an Even-numbered and an Odd-numbered VOR airway coincide, the ODD or EVEN altitude rule for the Even-numbered VOR airway will apply.

**CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES** When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as illustrated below.

The Civil Air Regulations do not require that a VFR flight plan be filed for a VFR flight. However, the flying of such a flight plan is desirable, and the CAA urges that VFR flights be covered by flight plan whenever practicable as such flying materially assists in search and rescue operations if such action becomes necessary. Flight plans may be submitted to the nearest CAA airway communications station either in person or by telephone. Flight plans may be filed by radio if no other means are available but this practice should be avoided whenever possible to reduce congestion of radio channels.

If filing the flight plan, the pilot should state the name of the CAA communications station with which he will close his flight plan, If the destination is not served by a CAA communications station, or is in Canada or Mexico, the method by which this arrival report will be filed must be clearly understood by all concerned, VFR flight plans are transmitted via CAA communications facilities only to the CAA communications station with which the pilot has stated his arrival report or closing of flight plan will be filed. One hour after the estimated time of arrival, if no notice of arrival is received, inquiries are sent out over CAA communications systems to determine the location of the aircraft. If no information concerning the aircraft is obtained after an exhaustive communications inquiry, search and rescue operations are inaugurated. In as much as the government may be put to considerable expense in determining the location of aircraft when an arrival report is not filed, it is utmost necessary that all pilots make certain that notices of arrival is filed. If flight is terminated prior to reaching the point of intended destination specified in the flight plan, pilots should contact the nearest CAA communications station and request that an arrival report be transmitted over CAA facilities to the CAA communications station with which the pilot stated the arrival report would be filed.

Pilots of aircraft operating on VFR flight plan who desire to make flight progress reports, should include in the report the phrase: "VFR FLIGHT PLAN FROM (blank) TO (blank)."

The flight plan shall contain the items listed under INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES - Flight Plan, except "Alternate Airport" and" contact a visual flight plan and invariably say "VFR" as a cruising altitude. The witch this operates visit appropriate engineer of the pilot intended for its incoherence with Visual Flight Rules. Aircraft may be operated in accordance with VFR above a well-defined under (or the engineer of helicopter), climb to and descent from "top top" flight can also be in accordance with VFR.

PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS
PILOTS - never hesitate to use your radio. Remember that talking by radio is almost the same as talking on your home telephone.

The following are typical examples of the way communication with airway stations.

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRWAY STATIONS: CAA Airways Communications Stations are identified by the name of the station followed by the word "RADIO".
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO".

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number and letter suffix, if any.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE".
"STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - Y".
Identification of aircraft.

Example of pilot calling an airway station:
"CLEVELAND RADIO, THIS IS - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER".
After communication has been established, an abbreviated form of identification may be used, if desired - using the last three units of the certificate number only.

The airway station will normally answer on the radio range or radiotelephone frequency. If reply is desired on other than the radio range or radiotelephone frequency, pilots should indicate the frequency on which the station reply is expected.
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - REPLY ON ONE ELEVEN POINT ONE MEGACYCLES.- OVER".

After the airway station has answered your call, proceed with your message without further call up other than preceding the message with the aircraft identification. Your message may consist of your position report, a request for weather data or other information that may be required to assist you to your destination.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER CLEVELAND AT ELEVEN TWENTY - FOUR THOUSAND. FEET ON VFR FLIGHT PLAN FROM YOUNGSTOWN TO TOLEDO - WHAT IS THE WEATHER AT TOLEDO - OVER".
If you are flying VFR, a position report is not required, however, it is to your advantage that the stations along your route of flight know your position at all times in order that assistance can be rendered should you encounter difficulty. Position reports will assist all stations in maintaining a constant check on your progress.

Flight plans may be filed while in flight with a CAA Airway Communications Station, if your departure was from an airport not served by such a station.

The word "ROGER" is used to acknowledge receipt of a message.

The word "OUT” is used when a conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - ROGER, OUT".

The words "SAY AGAIN" are used if a message was not understood and a repetition is desired.

The words "STAND BY" are used to indicate that a return call will be made as soon as practicable.
Examples: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - SAY AGAIN, OVER".
"STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - STAND BY".

ENROUTE FLIGHT SERVICE

All airways communications stations are ready to provide pilots with enroute flight information or assistance at any time. You may call any CAA RADIO for latest weather your route of flight, upper wind velocities, airport conditions, and other flight information. If you become lost or uncertain of your position, call any CAA radio. Personnel at CAA airway communications stations are trained to assist pilots in establishing position by any of the following methods: (a) Visual reference to terrain features; (b) Low frequency radio range orientation; (c) VHF omni-range indications (triangulations).

The U.S. phonetic alphabet (Able, Baker, Charlie, etc.) has been supplanted by the international (ICAO) phonetic alphabet at all CAA communication stations as of April 1, 1952. However, the U.S phonetic alphabet will continue to used upon request at the stations.
CAA facilities will continue to use normal English pronunciation instead of the international pronunciation of the numbers.

SECTIONAL CHARTS
The sectional aeronautical chart series provides complete coverage of the United States. An additional chart covers the Hawaiian Islands. These charts are designed primarily for piloting, which is also known as contact flying. They contain a maximum amount of cultural topographic features including important landmarks.

Sectional charts are revised at six-month periods to insure that the airman has the latest information available, and are sold through authorized agents located at airports and principal cities throughout the United States. They may also be obtained by writing to the Director, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce Building, Washington 25, D. C.

In the lower right-hand corner is printed the date of the chart. Below this the next scheduled printing is indicated. If the date of the chart is more than six months old, users are advised to check with the natives "Dates of Latest Prints" on file with authorized agents. Charts that carry older dates than those shown in large type on this list of dates are obsolete.

V.H.F. OMNI-RANGE (VOR)
The V.H.F. omni-range operates within the 112-118 megacycle band. In this band it is relatively free from atmospheric and precipitation static and interference from other radio stations. Furthermore, it is not limited to four courses as is the A-N range, but provides definite guidance on any course to or from the station, the pilot may elect. That is why it is called the Omni (Directional) Range. At minimum instrument altitudes the VOR gives reliable indications up to about 50 statute miles (43 nautical miles), depending on enroute terrain.
In flying by the V.H.F. omni-range, the pilot uses three basic instruments. The first is the Flight Path Deviation Indicator (cross pointer instrument), the same type used for the visual-aural range (VAI.) and the ILS localizer. The vertical needle of this instrument tells the pilot whether he is right or left of the desired course. The second is an Omni-bearing Selector, manually operated by the rotation of a small knob, by which the pilot selects the course he desires to fly. When the cross-pointer needle is centered, the omni-bearing selector indicates the magnetic bearing of the aircraft either to or from the station. The third is a "TO-FROM" Indicator which shows whether the bearing indicated by the Omni-bearing Selector is from or to the station. Furthermore, the "TO-FROM" needle can tell a flier when his aircraft is too far from the VOR or is otherwise receiving a weak signal. In this case the needle points to a red sector instead of TO or FROM.*
In operation, the pilot selects a course by adjusting the omni-bearing selector to the desired magnetic bearing, and then maintains it by keeping the cross-pointer needle centered. If the aircraft is correctly aligned with the TO-FROM indication, when the reetle swinas to the riaht. for exammle. it indicates that the course selected lies to the riaht.
For example, an aircraft is due south of a VOR station. If it is pilot desires to fly to the station, he sets the omni-bearing selector to indicate 0°. The "TO-FROM" indicator will then point to the word "TO". As the aircraft passes over the station the "TO-FROM" indicator will point to the word "FROM". If a turn of 180° is made north of the station, although the vertical cross-pointer needle will again become centered, the "TO-FROM" indicator will still point to "FROM". The pilot, however, will now find that he must fly "Away from the needle" to stay on course. This shows him that the "TO-FROM" indicator is inverted. So, the pilot now rotates his omni-bearing selector to 180°. After he has done this, the "TO-FROM" indicator shifts to the "TO" position, and flying "Toward the needle" will keep him on course.

TABLE OF V.H.F. RECEPTION DISTANCES
With the increasing use of VHF and UHF frequencies for communication and navigation it appears desirable to publicize reception distances for these frequencies. They, therefore, are tabulated below:
 Feet Above Ground                  Reception Distance
  Station*                            Statute Miles         Nautical Miles

15,000                                    175                       150
20,000                                    200                       175 *No physical obstruction intervening.
**Based on zero elevation of the facility. (Distances to nearest even 5 miles).
If you are using a VHF transmitter, remember that its effective range increases with your altitude. Don't attempt to connect
a station unless you are within "line of sight". 

U.S. WEATHER BROADCASTS AND TRANSMISSIONS
All continuously operated CAA radio range and radio beacon stations having voice facilities on the range or radio beacon frequencies broadcast weather reports and airway information at 15 and 45 minutes past each hour. The 15-minutes past-the-hour broadcast is an "airway" broadcast consisting of weather reports from important terminals located on airways (?) within approximately 400 statute miles (360 nautical miles) of the station. The 45-minutes-past-the-hour broadcast is an "area broadcast consisting of weather reports from locations within the flight information area of the station.
The broadcast consists of the local weather report and the latest available surface reports from other locations. Reports more than one hour old are not broadcast. Local winds aloft are broadcast 4 times after the broadcast at 6:15 and 12:15 A.M., and 8 P.M., E.S.T. The velocities of winds aloft are broadcast in knots.
At selected stations the Weather Bureau provides a local terminal forecast covering the next two hours. This forecast is broadcast, when available, immediately following the local weather report.
Pilots enroute are requested to avoid, if possible, calling airway communications stations at or about 15 and 45 minutes past the hour (which are the scheduled broadcast times) to request weather information, as such calls may delay .siitt'!, of scheduled broadcasts and cause incony venience to other persons who are dependent on the broadcasts for weather repo

AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONES (ADIZ)

In the United States several areas have been designated as Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ) by the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics in the interest of national security. All aircraft entering the Air Defense Identification Zones are required to file flight plans, except aircraft entering from within the Continental Limits of the United States or operating within the Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Knoxville, Great Falls, Minneapolis, Traverse City, and Bangor Zones, at altitudes of less than 4000 feet above the immediate terrain. Any person who knowingly or willfully fails to do so is subject to penalties of one year in prison or $10,000 fine. The Air Defense Identification Zones are identified as follows: Seattle ADIZ, San Francisco ADIZ, Los Angeles ADIZ, Atlantic ADIZ, Pacific ADIZ, Albuquerque ADIZ, Knoxville ADIZ, Great Falls ADIZ, Minneapolis ADIZ, Traverse City ADIZ, Bangor ADIZ, Mexican Boundary ADIZ, and Canadian Boundary ADIZ. These areas are indicated on the face of Aeronautical Charts and are so labeled. For additional information see Civil Air Regulations Part 620.

Oxnard, California

28 January 1953

To:	Commander, N.B.C., Point Mugu
From: 	
Subject:	Report of flight of unidentified object along coast line of N.B.C., 28 January 1953

At 1300 23 January 1953, the [REDACTED], boat, [REDACTED], was tied to its mooring buoy approximately 1,100 yards directly offshore from Fox A Loma for the purpose of observing R. D. launching after having recovered RP-2 from the surf at 1115, and delivered same to Frexel base at Hueneme.

At 1300 a R. B.F-3 was airborne, and two tenders and myself were following its flight. However, we lost sight of the R. D. in the distance and were settling for its return to the Fox A Loma. Since I had last seen the R. D. in the direction of Hunem, which is on compass bearing of approximately 200 degrees magnetic from our [REDACTED] buoy, I observed the approach of a jet airplane of the type which had been used as control plane on the preceding flight of a [REDACTED]. It seemed likely that this plane might have the [REDACTED] under control so I concentrated my attention on it as it approached Fox A from Hueneme.

When this plane was approximately at the western boundary of N.B.C., bounded by Arnold road, I sighted a white object which I mistook for the units of the R. D. L. wing. However, its approach was so rapid that it was instantly apparent it was not the R. D., but some unknown object.

I called to the two men in the boat with me and tried to point it out. One of the men, [REDACTED], saw it as a white streak, but since I had no chance to pick it up before it was overhead, I had sufficient time to make out its shape, color, flight and the fact that it seemed to have rather fuzzy or shimmering perimeter.

Since it: appeared above and from the stem of the jet plane, which I estimated was traveling at approximately 150 to 200 knots, there was an opportunity to judge its speed. Between the time the jet plane had traveled from Arnold Road to the beach absolute station east of Arnold Road, a matter of about three seconds, this object overtook the jet traveling on the same course and directly over the plane. The object did not alter speed or course, but continued on a straight line to the east toward Magu Rock and disappeared in the haze headed in the general direction of Santa Monica.

Here is the extracted text from the document:

```
The general appearance of this object was a white flat disk approximately 
eighteen to twenty inches in diameter. However, its size might be larger 
as I had no way of checking its altitude other than it seemed well above 
the mountains adjacent to Mugu Rock. The shimmering outline could be 
compared to observing the moon on a bright sunny day, except there were 
no dark marks anywhere on this object. 

It is our custom to report any craft not authorized in the launching area 
and to note the time they appear. I called Erskine P.C. at 1300 and in-
quired if he could confirm what I had seen after I described it to him. 
It is quite probable that whoever received my transmission did not under-
stand what I was talking about or at least thought I was pressure happy. 
He informed me our services were no longer needed on the sea test range 
and that we were to return to port. 

When I arrived in port, I called Lt. Commander Wauer by land line and 
made the same report. He subsequently instructed us to make this 
written description. 

It is quite probable that there will be some doubt as to the accuracy of 
this report, but I can only say I have been observing the flight of planes 
and missiles at M.I.C. since 1949 and have some knowledge of their character-
istics and speeds. I have never seen any plane or missile which resembled 
this object nor came within one half its speed.
