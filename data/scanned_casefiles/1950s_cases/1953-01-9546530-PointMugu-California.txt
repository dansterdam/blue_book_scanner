NAUTICAL MILES

For convenience in converting distances expressed in statute miles to their equivalents in nautical miles, and vice versa, the table below has been prepared. The United States nautical mile has been used for the table.

The United States nautical mile is defined as equal to one-sixth of a degree (one minute) of a great circle on a sphere whose surface is equal to the surface of the earth. The value of a nautical mile is calculated on this basis as 1853.25 meters or 6,080.20 feet. Since the common or statute mile is equal to 5,280 feet, one nautical mile equals approximately 1.152 statute miles, and one statute mile equals approximately 0.868 nautical mile. For quick calculation the nautical mile may be considered approximately one-sixth longer than the statute mile.

In the lower margins of the sectional charts is provided a convenient conversion scale by which values in statute miles may be readily converted to nautical miles and vice versa. Distances expressed in either unit may thus be scaled directly on the chart.

The length of one minute of latitude measured along a meridian on the surface of the earth at latitude 46°15' is equal to a United States nautical mile. North or south of 46°15' the length of a minute is slightly longer or shorter, since the earth is not a perfect sphere. However, for practical purposes, this nautical mile is considered equivalent to a statute mile at any point on the earth's surface.

Therefore, the one-minute subdivisions of the meridian lines on the face of charts may also be used for scaling distances.

The knot is a unit of speed only. One knot is equal to one nautical mile per hour; as, when an aircraft is traveling 200 nautical miles per hour, its speed is 200 knots.

[The rest of the document contains two conversion tables: "Statute Miles to Nautical Miles" and "Nautical Miles to Statute Miles", with columns for Statute Miles, Nautical Miles, and Feet, ranging from 0.1 to 1000.]

SEARCH AND RESCUE SERVICE
Search and Rescue Service is a life saving service provided through the combined efforts of the U.S.A., Air Force, and Coast Guard who are assisted by other organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Sheriff, Air Patrol, State Police, and such other agencies as may be available. It provides search, survival aid, and rescue of personnel of missing or crashed aircraft.

All you need to remember to obtain this valuable protection is:
1. File a Flight Plan with a CAA Airways Communications Station in person or by telephone or radio.
2. File an Arrival Report.
3. If you land at a location other than intended destination, report the landing to the nearest CAA Communications Station.
4. If you land enroute and are delayed more than an hour, report this information to the nearest communications station.
5. Remember that if you fail to report within one hour after your E.T.A., a search will be started to locate you. If you fail to report within three hours after your E.T.A., the full facilities of the Search and Rescue Service will be activated.

Searches are expensive, they inconvenience other people, and on numerous occasions the lives of other pilots are sacrificed when searching for lost or overdue pilots. SO, FILE AN ARRIVAL REPORT!

CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - During VFR conditions aircraft at altitudes of or even 1000-foot levels appropriate to the direction of flight "Odd" and "Even" indicated. Under VFR conditions with control zones and control areas, including controlled airway, aircraft shall fly at altitudes in accordance with ATC clearances.

The following rules will govern the altitude at which aircraft shall fly when making VFR flights along controlled civil airways:

Green and Red Airways and Even-numbered VOR Airways
Eastbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet)
Westbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet)

Amber and Blue Airways and Odd-numbered VOR Airways
Northbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet)
Southbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet)

The following rules will apply on segments where color airways and VOR airways overlap:
Where a color airway coincides with a VOR airway, the ODD or EVEN rule for the appropriate color airway will apply.
Where no color airway is involved and an Even-numbered VOR airway is on Odd-numbered VOR airway, the ODD or EVEN rule will apply.

CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES- When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as illustrated below.

[A circular diagram with magnetic courses and aircraft altitude rules is shown]

VISUAL FLIGHT PLAN

The Civil Air Regulations do not require that a VFR flight plan be filed for a VFR flight. However, the filing of such a flight plan is desirable, and the CAA urges that VFR flights be covered by flight plan whenever practicable as well as in search and rescue operations if such action becomes necessary. Flight plans may be submitted to the nearest CAA airway communications station either in person or by telephone. Flight plans may be filed by radio in the other areas available but this practice should be avoided whenever possible to reduce congestion of radio channels.

[The rest of the text continues with details about filing flight plans, but some words are partially obscured at the bottom of the page]

PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS

PILOTS - never hesitate to use your radio. Remember that talking by radio is almost the same as talking on your home telephone.

The following are typical examples of two-way communication with airway stations.

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRWAY STATIONS: CAA Airway Communications Stations are identified by the name of the station followed by the word "RADIO".
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO"

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number and letter suffix, if any.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE"
"STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE"

Example of pilot calling an airway station:
"CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER"
After communication has been established, an abbreviated form of identification may be used, if desired, using the last three digits of the certificate number only.

The airway station will normally answer on the radio range or radiobeacon frequency. If reply is desired on other than the radio range of radiobeacon frequency, pilots should indicate the frequency on which the station reply is expected.

Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - REPLY ON ONE ELEVEN POINT ONE MEGACYCLES - OVER"

After the airway station has answered your call, proceed with your message without further call up other than preceding the message with the aircraft identification. Your message may consist of your position report, a request for weather data or other information that may be required to assist you to your destination.

Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER CLEVELAND AT ELEVEN TWENTY - FOUR THOUSAND PEN FLIGHT PLAN FROM YOUNGSTOWN TO TOLEDO - WHAT IS THE WEATHER AT TOLEDO - OVER"

If you are flying VFR, a position report is not required, however, it is to your advantage that the stations along your route of flight know your position at all times in order that passengers can be rendered smooth service efficiently.

Flight plans may be filed while in flight, with a CAA Airway Communications Station, if your departure was from an airport not served by such a station.

The word "ROGER" is used to acknowledge receipt of a message.

The word "OUT" is used when a conversation is ended and no response is expected.

Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - ROGER, OUT"

The words "SAY AGAIN" are used if a message was not understood and a repetition is desired.

The words "STAND BY" are used to indicate that a return call will be made as soon as practicable.

Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - SAY AGAIN, OVER"
"STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - STAND BY"

ENROUTE FLIGHT SERVICE
All airway communications stations are ready to provide pilots with enroute flight information or assistance at any time. You may call any CAA RADIO for latest weather along your route of flight, upper wind velocities, airport conditions, and other flight information. If you become lost or uncertain of your position, call any CAA RADIO. Personnel at CAA airway communications stations are trained to assist pilots in establishing position by any of the following methods: (a) Visual reference to terrain features; (b) Low frequency radio range orientation; (c) VHF omnidirectional range triangulations.

SECTIONAL CHARTS

The sectional aeronautical chart series provides complete coverage of the United States, Hawaiian Islands, and Guam. These charts are designed primarily for piloting and maximum amount of cultural topographic features including important landmarks.

Sectional charts are revised at six-months periods to insure that the airman has the latest information available, and are sold by writing to the Director, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce Building, Washington 25, D.C.

In the lower right-hand corner is printed the date of the chart. Below this the method of obtaining additional charts is indicated. If the date of the chart is more than six months old, users are advised to check with the issuers or plates of latest prints on file with authorized agents. Charts that carry older dates than those shown in large type on this list are obsolete.

[The rest of the text includes a map of United States Sectional Aeronautical Charts and a section titled "ADDITIONAL AERONAUTICAL CHARTS PUBLISHED AND PRINTED BY THE U.S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY" which lists various types of charts with their specifications and scales.]

V.H.F. OMNI-RANGE (VOR)

The V.H.F. omni-range operates within the 112-118 megacycle band. In this band it is relatively free from atmospheric and precipitation static and interference from other radio stations. Furthermore, it is not limited to four courses as is the A-N range, but provides definite guidance on any course, to or from the station, the pilot may select. That is why it is called the Omni (Directional) Range. At minimum instrument altitudes the VOR gives reliable indications up to about 50 statute miles (48 nautical miles), depending on environment factors.

In flying the V.H.F. omni-range, the pilot uses three basic instruments. The first is the Flight Path Deviation Indicator (cross-pointer instrument), the same type used for the visual-aural range (VAR) and the ILS localizer. The vertical needle of this instrument tells the pilot whether his is right or left of the desired course. The second is an Omni-bearing Selector, manually operated by the rotation of a small knob, by which the pilot selects the course he desires to fly. When the error-pointer becomes centered, the omni-bearing selector indicates the magnetic bearing of the aircraft either to or from the station. The third is a "TO-FROM" indicator which shows whether the bearing indicated by the Omni-bearing Selector is from or to the station. Furthermore, the "TO-PROM" needle can tell a flier when his aircraft is too far from the VOR or is otherwise receiving a weak signal. In this case the needle pointing to a red sector indicates that.

In operation, the pilot selects a course by adjusting the omni-bearing selector to the desired magnetic bearing, and then maintains the course by keeping the cross-pointer needle centered. If the aircraft is correctly aligned with the TO-FROM indication, the inside swings to the right, for example, it indicates that the course selected lies to the right.

For example, an aircraft is due south of a VOR station. If its pilot desires to fly to the station, he sets the omni-bearing selector to indicate "FROM". As the aircraft passes over the station, the "TO-FROM" indicator will point to the word "FROM". If a turn of 180° is made north of the station, although the vertical course-pointer needle will still point to "FROM". The pilot, however, will now find that he must fly "Away from the needle" to stay on course. This shows him that the "TO-FROM" indicator is incorrect. So, the pilot now rotates his omni-bearing selector to 180°. After he has done this, the "TO-FROM" indicator shifts to the "TO" position, and flying "Toward the needle" will keep him on course.

Oxnard, California                                                      23 January 1953

To:     Commander, ATIC, Point Mugu
From:   
Subject: Report of flight of unidentified object along coast line of
         NWMC, 22 January 1953

At 1200 22 January 1953, the [redacted] boat, Lexie Line, was tied
to it's mooring boy approximately 1,100 yards directly offshore from Loc A.
Late for the purpose of clearing NAS, the [redacted] of NAS were removing a
JD-2 from the surf at 1115, and delivered same to Drydel base at Hueneme.

At 1300 a NDB-3 was airborne, and by two tenders and myself were follow-
ing its flight. However, we lost sight of the NDB. In the distance and were
waiting for its return to the Port A area. Since I & B last seen the NDB in
the vicinity of Hueneme, which is on compass bearing of approximately 240
degrees relative from our zig-zag base, I observed the approach of a jet air-
plane of the type which had been used as control plane on the preceding
flight of a JD-2. It seemed like this plane was at the level of the boat, under
control so I concentrated my attention on it as it approached Loc 4 from
Hueneme.

When this plane was approximately at the western boundary of NWMC, bounded
by Arnold road, I sighted a white object which I mistook for the white of
the JD-2 in the distance. However, its approach was so rapid it was instantly
apparent it was not the JD-2, but some unknown object.

I called to the two men in the boat with me and tried to point it out. One
of the men, [redacted], saw it as a white streak, but since I had a chance
to pick it up before it was overshot, I had sufficient time to make out its
shape, color, flight, and the fact that it seemed to have rather hazy or
shimmering perimeter.

Since it appeared above and from the stern of the jet plane, which I estimated
was traveling at approximately 150 to 200 knots, there was an opportunity to
judge its speed. Between the time the jet plane had traveled from Arnold
road to the beach (another station) part of approximately a matter of about
three seconds, this object overhealed the jet traveling, on the same course
and directly over the plane. The object did not alter speed or course, but
continued on a straight line. The object moved high and disappeared
in the haze headed in the general direction of Santa Monica.

- page 21 -

The general appearance of this object was a white flat disk approximately eighteen to twenty inches in diameter. However, its size might be larger as I had no way of checking its altitude other than it seemed well above the horizon. The object had no dark markings and I could be compared to observing the moon on a bright sunny day, except there were no dark marks anywhere on this object.

It is our custom to report any craft not authorized in the launching area and to note the time they appear. I called Specific A.F.C. at 1306 and inquired if he could confirm what I had seen. I was on the air at 1330 hrs.

It is quite probable that whoever received my transmission did not understand that I was talking about or at least thought I was pressure happy. The information I gave was no longitude and that we were to return to port.

When I arrived in port, I called Lt. Commander Hanson by land line and made the same report. He subsequently instructed me to make this written description.

It is quite possible that there will be some doubt as to the accuracy of this report, but I can only say I have been observing the flight of planes and missiles at 1,150 miles per hour and 1/196 of the characteristics and speeds. I have never seen any plane or missile which resembled this object, nor came within one half its speed.

1. WHEREAS, Between 1700 and 1800 hours, 28 January 1953, three men sighted a flying object from a ship near Point Mugu, California, which they concluded was definitely not a conventional flying aircraft.

2. WHEREAS, This District Office is in receipt of a letter of transmittal from the Naval Intelligence Office, Maveena Naval District, Los Angeles, California, which contains a statement of fact concerning his sighting with two of his employees on an unconventional flying object between 1700 and 1800 hours, 28 January 1953.

3. The sighting was made by [redacted] and his two tenants, one of whom was a [redacted].

4. The above named gentlemen were on the Mccas Inn which was moored off shore from the Naval Air Missile Training Center, Point Mugu, California, their position was to observe the launching and to recover one of these launchings. While observing, [redacted] and his assistants lost sight of the I.D. but observed the appearance of a jet aircraft. While observing this aircraft, the three men noticed an object which at first they mistook for the wing of a B.29's wing. Further observation disclosed that it was not any part of the aircraft or from their experience was it a I.D.

5. The speed of the object greatly exceeded that of the jet aircraft which was traveling between 150 to 250 knots per hour.

6. The object was going in an easterly direction toward Mugu Rock and disappeared in the general direction of Santa Clara, California.
