TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

A document was received at this headquarters on 9 February 1953 concerning a report of an unidentified flying object sighting at the Carswell AFB, Texas area on 2 February 1953. The report, as submitted by the observer, 1st Lt XXXXXXX, is as follows:

"On 2 February 1953, at approximately 0700 hours, while on routine flight crew duty, I observed an unidentified object in the sky over Carswell AFB, Texas. The object was first sighted approximately 25 miles southwest of Carswell at an altitude of around 10,000 feet. As it approached Carswell, the object descended to an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and was metallic or light in color. The object was about the size of a B-36 bomber, and moved at an approximate speed of 300 knots. It was under excellent observation for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before it disappeared from view by rapidly climbing to an altitude where it could no longer be seen."

The report indicates that this sighting was promptly reported to the base operations office and the 3 rd Air Division, the report was reviewed and forwarded to this headquarters for appropriate action.

1. Reference is made to the additional information mentioned in paragraph 1 of Comment No. 1. This information is quoted:

"Blips were at extreme range of radar, and operator could not tell whether they were aircraft, birds, or weather. Blips did not change size. Blips disappeared into noise and did not reappear. Radar observers were unable to track them up on successive B-36 aircraft. Returns of nearest blip were very sharp compared to B-36 target. Other blips were just above noise, similar to B-36 radar."

2. The characteristics of the above signals are compatible with those of ground returns. The indicated weather conditions indicate that there was a temperature inversion at 1000 MB pressure (near the earth) and at 950 MB pressure.

3. It is considered that it is highly probable that the reported radar targets were ground targets.

1. Enclosed is a radar sighting on 13 Feb 53 from Carswell AFB, Texas, concerning radar blips picked up by 5-55 radar. In conformity with this report, your office states that the radar information supplied was insufficient for identifying the objects observed and suggests that the targets concerned may have been identified as aircraft. No other definite conclusions or identifications were made and additional information needed and incloses it herewith.

2. According to this information the targets in question were moving and also a certain amount of ground clutter or "notational" present. Project Blue Book requests whether temperature inversion was present or any other phenomena known to you could have caused this sighting.

CASE #26
13 Feb 53
At 0235 in the morning of 13 Feb 53, a civilian visually observed 3 very bright lights traveling at a very high rate of speed over Fort Worth, Texas. These weather were circular in shape and clear and calm.
These unidentified objects were traveling from ESE toward the observer at a moderate rate of speed. (Cruising speed of a T-33.) The 3 lights had the same intensity as the rotating beacon at Carswell AFB. All 3 lights were of similar intensity, and white in color except the center light which was blinking green. These lights were observed for a period of 10-15 seconds until disappearing out of sight.
The lights were first observed approximately 500' apart and appeared stacked in vertical echelon. The light suddenly accelerated a distance of 1500' and came to a complete stop. In sequence the other 2 lights duplicated this maneuver. After assuming the original formation these lights repeated the same maneuver only ending up in horizontal echelon. The maneuvers appeared to take a distance of 2 miles and an altitude at or below 6,000'. After the 3 lights came to a stand-still in a third maneuver they were arranged in a vertical echelon; then with the center light acting as a pivot the 2 other lights maneuvered in a swinging motion resembling the motion of a kite's tail. The lights were next observed in a steep climb and attained an altitude of approximately 20,000' very rapidly.
A Radar technician then began to pick up blip on the tail radar of B-36 a/c. The lapse of time between visual and first radar sighting was estimated 2 minutes. The lights were observed at a maximum azimuth of 90 deg to the S, between 40-50 deg vertical angle, between 6-10,000 yards on readings. On a 2-3/4 multiplier, this distance would be approximately 16,000 yards.
Only two of the three original lights were observed on the radar. There was a considerable amount of "snow" but the closer blip was distinguished easily. A check for ground returns was made and none was received. An attempt was made to pick up these lights on 3 different radar sets of other a/c with negative results.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document related to a UFO incident.

CASE #3 (CONT'D)
INCIDENT: The original observer, 3 other observers witnessed this incident. An Electronics Data Sheet was forwarded to Carswell AFB to be filled out so as to get technical information on radar.

The radar data contained in the report from Carswell AFB was not sufficient for analysis purposes. For instance, there was no indication that the target observed on the radar was the same as the visual sighting. The weather data contained indicated that there was a temperature inversion and a moisture lapse at about the time of the incident. This weather condition could cause radar ground clutter signals to appear above the horizon, although the report states that a check indicated no ground return signals were received. A wire was sent to Carswell AFB requesting information as to whether the objects were seen on radar. Radar operators at Carswell AFB stated that this was not the case and they did not move in azimuth. Also stated that blip did not change size. Blip disappeared into noise and did not reappear. Radar eye observers then attempted to pick them up on tail radar of another a/c. This attempt was unsuccessful. 

ATTIC FILM AND CONCLUSION
Based on the above stated information, there was a temperature inversion at the time of sighting and it is believed by ATTIC analysts that radar sighting was a temperature inversion or weather effects on radar and the visual sighting was an a/c flight.

The image contains a photograph of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text in the document describes a sighting of lights traveling across the sky over Fort Worth, Texas on February 13, 1953. The report includes details about the observed lights, their behavior, and the witness accounts.

UNCLASSIFIED
1. On the evening of 13 Feb 1953, various lights were observed that were travelling across the sky over Fort Worth, Texas. The weather was clear and calm. These lights appeared to travel in an unusual fashion which was reminiscent of a radar screen display. They would dart about, stop and accelerate at varying speeds. They were observed for a period of 10 to 15 minutes until they disappeared.
2. The lights were first observed approximately 500 feet apart and appeared to be traveling at a constant speed of about 1500 feet and came to a complete stop. In essence the other two lights duplicated this maneuver. After this maneuver the three lights regained the same manner only adding up and down vertical motion. These maneuvers appeared to take place in a horizontal direction. These maneuvers appeared to be controlled in a fashion similar to the early B-26 and B-29 throttle controls of World War II with the outer lights maneuvering in relation to the center light acting as a pivot.
3. The lights were next observed in a steep climb and attained an altitude of 20,000 feet. The lights then picked up speed and disappeared radar on -35 aircraft.
210, Aviation #7, it appears that the lights were estimated to be about 3-10,000 feet in altitude and travelling at a speed of about 3,000-5,000 yards per second. On a 2-3 multiplier, this distance would be approximately 9,000-15,000 yards or about 5-8 miles away. A sketch of the type formation received is attached as an enclosure.
5. Besides the members of Department 76 at Carswell, 2 other members of Department 76 at Carswell witnessed this incident. Their names and addresses are listed below.
