INFO: RESTRICTED
FROM: AFOIN-ATIAE-7-16-E FOR 19th Air Division

Returning 742 644 0835 13 Feb 53, radar-visual sighting of unidentified objects.

Mr. [redacted], and [redacted] making radar sighting from B-36.

ATIC has received Electronics Data Sheet submitted by your Base. Additional questions which arise follow: 1) Were the 2 radar blips moving? 2) Did they change size rapidly? 3) If moving, was the speed variable? 4) Did they appear and disappear, then reappear at a new location? 5) Were they sharp returns compared to known aircraft targets? The above is needed to analyse radar portion of sighting.

1. Your station's unidentified object report involving radar detection for the above date has been received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center and reviewed by its electronics personnel.

2. It was found that insufficient radar data existed for an explanation of this sighting and, therefore, ATIC is forwarding the enclosed Electronics Data Sheet. This Center realizes that the subject sighting took place four months ago however, if the radar personnel involved can remember the facts of the sighting, ATIC requests that they fill out this form.

3. With the information provided by this form the Air Technical Intelligence Center feels that a logical explanation can be made for the incident.

The lights were colored vertically and moved from S3 to S3 in three to ten second intervals, occasionally shifting position so that they appeared to swing like a pendulum on the center light. They also noted attitude as their aerial movement was generally upward to westerly. The lights were tremendous speed, gray-greenish-cast in color and the center light was white. No sound was heard. The weather was clear.

ATIAE2/Mg/Jakes/vh

1. Reference is made to the additional information mentioned in paragraph 1 of Comment No. 1. This information is quoted below:

"Blips were at extreme range of radar and operator could not tell whether they moved in range, but they did not move in azimuth. Blips did not change size. Blips disappeared into noise and did not reappear. Radar observers then attempted to pick them up on tail area of another B-36 aircraft unsuccessfully. Returns of nearest blip were very sharp compared to B-36 target. Other blip was just above noise level of the radar."

2. The characteristics of the above signals are compatible with those of ground return. The inclosed weather information indicates that there was a temperature inversion at 1000 Mb pressure (near the earth) and at 850 Mb pressure. Also a rapid moisture lapse began at 890 Mb pressure.

3. It is considered that it is highly probable that the reported radar targets were ground targets.

4. This correspondence may be downgraded to CONFIDENTIAL upon removal of inclosure, in accordance with paragraph 25e, Air Force Regulation 205-1.

In a preliminary analysis of this report, your office stated that the radar information was insufficient for you to analyze. For example, there was no indication that the targets observed on the AFG-41 were moving targets. Project Blue Book has requested and received the additional information needed and enclosed it herewith.

2. According to this information the targets in question were moving and also a certain amount of ground clutter or "noise" was present. Project Blue Book requests your office determine, in light of the additional information you had requested, whether temperature inversion was present or any other phenomena known to you could have caused this sighting.

CASE #24
13 Feb 53                                                 Carswell AFB, Texas

At 0235 in the morning of 13 Feb 53, a civilian visually observed 3 very bright lights traveling across the sky over Fort Worth, Texas. The weather was clear and calm.

These unidentified objects were traveling from SSE toward the observer at a moderate rate of speed. (Cruising speed of a F-86.) The 3 lights had the same intensity as the rotating beacon at Carswell AFB. All 3 lights were of similar intensity, and white in color except the center light which was bluish-green. These lights were observed for a period of 10-15 minutes till disappearing out of sight.

The lights were first observed approximately 500' apart and appeared stacked in vertical echelon. The light suddenly accelerated a distance of 1500' and came to a complete stop. In sequence the other 2 lights duplicated this maneuver. After assuming the original formation these lights repeated the same maneuver only ending up in horizontal echelon. These maneuvers appeared to take place over a distance of 2 miles and at an altitude at or below 4,000'. After the 3 lights came to a stand-still in a third maneuver they were arranged in a verticle echelon; then with the center light acting as a pivot the 2 outer lights maneuvered in a swinging motion resembling the motion of a kite's tail. The lights were next observed in a steep climb and attained an altitude of approximately 20,000' very rapidly.

A Radar technician then by picked up blip on the tail radar of B-36 a/c. The lapse of time between visual and first radar sighting was estimated 2 minutes. The lights were observed at a maximum azimuth of 80 deg to the S, between 40-50 deg vertical angle, between 8-10,000 yards on sighting. On a 2-2½ multiplier, this distance would be approximately 16,000 yards.

Only two of the three original lights were observed on the radar. There was a considerable amount of "snow" but the closer blip was distinguished easily. A check for ground returns was made and none was received. An attempt was made to pick up these lights on 3 different radar sets of other a/c with negative results.


- page 22 -

CASE #24 (conta)

Besides the original observer, 8 other observers witnessed this incident. An Electronics Data Sheet was forwarded to Carswell AFB to be filled out so as to get technical information on radar.

The radar data contained in the report from Carswell AFB was not sufficient for analysis purposes. For instance, there was no indication that the targets observed on the radar set were moving targets. The weather data submitted indicated that there was a temperature inversion and a moisture lapse at about the time of the incident.

This weather condition could cause radar ground clutter signals to appear above the horizon, although the report states that a check indicated no ground return signals were received. A wire was sent to Carswell AFB requesting information as to whether the objects moved or not. Radar operators at Carswell AFB stated that this was extreme range of radar and operator could not tell whether they moved in range but they did not move in azimuth. Also stated that blip did not change side. Blip dispersed into noise and did not reappear. Radar eye observers then attempted to pick them up on tail radar of another a/c. This attempt was unsuccessful.

ATIC Comment and Conclusion
From
Since the above stated information, there was a temperature inversion at the time of sighting and it is believed by ATIC analysts that radar sighting was a temperature inversion or weather effects on radar and the visual sighting was an a/c flight.

1. At 0235 in the morning of 13 Feb 1953, we _______ visually observed 3
very dim lit lights traveling across the sky over Fort Worth, Texas. The weather was
clear and calm. These unidentified objects were traveling from east southeast toward
the observer at a moderate rate of speed (cruising speed of an F-86). The 3 lights
had the same intensity as 3 the rotating beacon at Carswell AFB. All 3 lights were
of similar intensity, and white in color except the center light which was yellowish-
green. These lights were observed for a period of 10 to 15 minutes until disappearing
out of sight.

2. The lights were first observed approximately 500 feet apart and appeared
stacked in vertical echelon. The lower light suddenly accelerated a distance of 1500
feet and came to a complete stop. In sequence the other two lights duplicated this
maneuver. After assembling in original formation, these 3 lights repeated the same
maneuver only sailing up in horizontal echelon. These maneuvers appeared to take place
over a distance of 2 miles and at an altitude at or below 4,000 feet. After the 3
lights came to a standstill in a third maneuver they were arranged in a vertical
echelon; then with the center light acting as a pivot the 2 outer lights maneuvered
in a swinging motion resembling the motion of a kite's tail.

3. The lights were next observed in a steep climb and attained an altitude of
20,000 feet very rapidly. (Unable to visual estimate - must be relying on radar)

4. At ______ then picked up blips on the tail(______) radar on B-36 aircraft
