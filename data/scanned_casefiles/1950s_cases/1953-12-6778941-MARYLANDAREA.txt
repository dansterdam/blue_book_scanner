The Thing' Starts
A New Wing-Ding

By the Associated Press

OTTAWA, Dec. 12 - Canadian
Air Force radar experts scanned
the skies for a "thing" today
after a crew of a trans-Canada
Air Lines plane reported sighting a strange greenish-blue light.

The pilot and co-pilot of the
TCA plane, bound from New
York to Toronto, said they had
sighted the light about 9 p.m.
Wednesday.

It brightened the clouds as it
descended slowly, they reported.
