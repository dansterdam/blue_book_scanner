The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned page of text from an old UFO report document. The text appears to be a newspaper article or report titled "The Thing Starts a New Wing-Ding" about an unidentified flying object or "thing" that was spotted in the sky.

OCR output:
The Thing Starts a New Wing-Ding
OTTAWA, Dec. 12 - Canadian observers today saw the skies for a "thing" today,
After 5 a.m. a strange greenish-blue light appeared in the east. The object,
which shot off in a burst of speed, was spotted by RCAF observers at various
points. Although this is the fourth time in recent weeks such a
thing has been observed, no satisfactory explanation has been given.
If brightened the clouds as it descended slowly, they reported.
