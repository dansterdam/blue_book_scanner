10. Lockbourne AFB operations stated that several B-47's landed shortly after 09:002, 12 Dec 57, and were possibly in the local area for a period of time before landing.

11. Position title and comments of the preparing officer, including his preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting: 1/Lt Wayne A. Toohills, Senior Director, 793rd AC&W SQ. The sighting was 40 miles west of Parkersburg, Ohio, lasting a total of 30,000 feet and first observed at 5:10 pm position, .20 miles from flight, closing very rapidly. Blip passed directly in front and turned west. Lost visual contact and held 2 minute sighting distance. Radar contact reported visual contact and Blue 3 had visual appearance described as a red flashing lights object disappear south 20 miles north of intersection. According to pilot, northeast, away from and toward observer at 720 knots 35,000 feet. It was observed that the radar appear to be the UO was then discovered tracking northeast, away from south of intersection at 720 knots 35,000 feet. The radar return was similar to that of a large aircraft, although both appearance and behavior were extremely unusual.
