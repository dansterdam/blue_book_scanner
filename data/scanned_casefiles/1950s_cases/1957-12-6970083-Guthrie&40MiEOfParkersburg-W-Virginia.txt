AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: United States
REPORT NO: IR-2-57

AREA REPORT CONCERNS: Parkersburg, Ohio

AGENCY OF ORIGIN: 58th Air Division (Defense)
DATE OF REPORT: 18 December 1957

SOURCE OF INFORMATION: 2nd Lt Wayne A. Rhodes, 783rd ACWRON, Avenger Blue Flight, 87th FIS
DATE OF INFORMATION: 11 December 1957

PREPARING OFFICER: JUANITA MANCHA, 2nd Lt, USAF

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report

SUMMARY:
An unidentified flying object was sighted by Avenger Blue Flight of 2 F86's out of Lockbourne AFB, Ohio. The object was sighted on 12/0230Z approximately 40 miles west of Parkersburg, Ohio. It was also seen on ground radar by the senior director at the 783rd ACWRON, Guthrie, W. Va.

Blue Flight aircraft #1 and #2 reported visual contact and blue 2 radar contact. The object was described as having red blinking lights, although shape was undetermined.

The radar blip appeared to be a fast aircraft and the object was estimated to be traveling at a speed of 720 knots at 35,000 feet by the senior director. It was in sight by the pilots for five minutes and by the controller for thirty minutes.

It is possible that the flashing red lights seen by the pilots may have been a B-47 preparing for letdown. Lockbourne Air Force Base Operations stated that several B-47's were inbound to TVOR at approximately the same time and altitude.

10. Lockbourne AFB operations stated that several B-47's landed shortly after 0100Z, 12 Dec 57, and were possibly in the local area for a period of time before landing.

11. Position title and comments of the preparing officer, including his preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting:

Sighting was by Avenger Blue, flight of 3 B66's. First sighting was 40 miles west of Parkersburg, Ohio, flight heading 090° at 30,000 feet. Radar blip appeared to be a fast aircraft. It was observed at 5 o'clock position, 20 miles from flight, closing very rapidly. Blue passed trailing pilot and moved into 4 o'clock position of Blue 2. It closed to and held 2 mile distance.

Blue 2 and Blue 3 both reported visual contact and Blue 3 had radar contact. Flight turned north, and object appeared to follow. Visual appearance was described as 6 red flashing lights. Object disappeared about 30 miles north of Parkersburg, according to pilot.

A blip thought to be the UFOB was then discovered tracking northeast, away from area of intersection at 720 knots, 35,000 feet. It proceeded out of range in that direction.

The radar return was similar to that of a large aircraft, although both speed, appearance and behavior were extremely unusual.
