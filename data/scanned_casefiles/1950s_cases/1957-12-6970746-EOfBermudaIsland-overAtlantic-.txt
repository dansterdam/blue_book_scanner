6. Observers:
   a. [Redacted], 1stLt, 59th Wea Recon Sq, Aerial Recon Weather Officer for three years, usually reliable.

   d. 80 miles.
   e. 3/8 alto stratus with tops at 8,000 feet.

11. Comments:
    a. Position: Squadron Intelligence Officer.
    b. Where opinions of the observers are different, I have given that difference followed by the individual's name.
    c. In my opinion, this sighting could possibly be a meteor. If, for example, the object was a meteor, about five miles away, and going down, the observers would have the illusion that the object was going past them to their rear in a shallow descent.
    d. Lt. [Redacted] sits in the nose airplane with plenty of windows. Capt. [Redacted] sat in the pilot's seat and can see almost as much as the weather man. The navigator sits facing the left of the airplane and has a small (about one square foot) at his upper right. Airman [Redacted] was sitting at the left
