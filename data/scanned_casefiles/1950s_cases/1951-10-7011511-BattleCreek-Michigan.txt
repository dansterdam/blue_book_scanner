10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Color was highly polished silver. Shape was oval under side. Some can't on top. Altitude was 3000 ft. No vapor trail, and no sound. Object approached head on but before pilot could take any action to prevent collision, pilot realized that the object would pass below him an estimated 1,000 ft. Extremely high rate of speed.

11. COMMENTS
Pilot stated that as the object passed beneath him, immediately orbited once then on course, but unable to see the object again, continued on course. Evaluated as balloon. Pilot estimated object approaching. Initial observation 1,000 ft below a/c. Assume collision incident but object was not sinking. After pilot passed object could not locate probably because object was not well above. Description of sighting in accord with balloon observation.

SUMMARY. (Give condensed story of report; include geographic and time limits)

Mr. [redacted], a civilian pilot of fourteen (14) years flying experience, encountered a strange, highly polished flying object, which closed head on with his Navion aircraft at a extremely high rate of speed, in the vicinity of Battle Creek, Michigan. Altitude of the object was estimated to be 3,000 feet and 1,000 feet below observer's aircraft.

Visibility conditions were unlimited above 4,000 feet and a haze restricted visibility to an estimated eight (8) miles below 4,000 feet.

Check of available sources both civil and military indicate no known aircraft in the vicinity of the sighting at that time.

Mr. [redacted], Austin Lake, Michigan, Airport Manager, has been interviewed and considers this a very credible individual. Investigating officer concurs in this estimate of observer.

[next line partially illegible] was studying a map at the time of the sighting and observ-
ed nothing of the object. [rest of paragraph partially obscured]

Factors:

1. Check with [name blacked out]. Airport Manager at Austin Lake indicates he has known [rest blacked out]

2. The interviewing officer's impression of [blacked out] was visibly uneasy with that of [blacked out]. Although he was at Detroit City Airport approximately four (4) hours after the occurrence, he stated that in his opinion, he had often laughed at reports of strange flying objects, but is "through laughing since this experience". [Name blacked out] was reluctant to tell his story. To pull details, he did tell his story in an ordered manner with frequent qualifications as to his accuracy of his facts. He was particularly impressed with the extremely high polish of the silver color and object and stated that in his estimation, no human surface could ever be polished to such a high brilliance. He was also detail in describing that his observation was of an indentation on the surface, so positioned, as to form a dome-shaped crown. [paragraph continues]

3. [First line blacked out] first soloed in 1927 and has been flying actively ever since. He flies small aircraft to two or three jobs a week and has apparently been in the air in this area on numerous occasions, he has never spotted jet aircraft in the air and has closed with them head on. He has observed weather balloons from the ground and from the air.

4. The only aircraft noted in the vicinity in question by Mr. [name blacked out] was a Navion aircraft, on an approved 6,000 foot, good to (10) miles visibility, flying in the general area at an altitude of approximately 4,000 feet. Mr. [name blacked out] watched the C-47 with its landing altimeter.

3rd Air Force, Michigan         PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

5. Check of all 30th Division Fighters squadrons indicates no known activity by Air Force after 6 October 1951. At approximately 2/1500, 6 October 1951, a flight of two F-51 aircraft from 331st Fighter Bomber Wing, flying a reconnaissance mission, were instructed to be on the alert for an unusual flying object which was ground sighted near Battle Creek. Check of civil aircraft activity applicable to the sighting. Check of military flight records, Air Force bases, and possible available correlation. This aircraft, a P-47, registration number AF-900L, had a VHF radio contact with Ground Control Intercept (GCI) site at 49,000 feet at approximately the time cited in question. Deviation from flight plan would be possible but not probable.

6. 30th Division radar stations with radar coverage of the area observed no target that can be correlated with reported object.

7. Request by Sergeant Grant, Landing detachment of State Police, for further investigation through Captain Bjorkland of 661st ACS Squadron, was denied by the Director of Intelligence, 30th Air Division.

8. Complete verbal report of all above information was relayed via land line to Director of Intelligence, MATS at 22/0930, October 1951.
