AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: USA
AREA REPORTING: CENTRAL MISSOURI
DATE OF REPORT: 17 July 1952
DATE OF INFORMATION: 1 July 1952
PREPARED BY: OTIS W. BAUSIE, Major, USAF
EVALUATION: B-3

Summary:
1. Source observed a star-like object in the sky to the North Northeast of Columbia, Missouri at 0140 hours CST. A star was plainly visible against the dark background below the Aurora.

2. Source watched it for a few minutes and detected movement in opposition to that of the stars. He examined it through a theodolite. Observation through the instrument showed an irregular change of color from red to green. Angular movement was small to follow. He was able to observe it until daylight observed it. Source says object lost its color between 0510 CST and 0538 CST. The object had the relative appearance of a planet approximately half the size of Jupiter as seen through the theodolite. The object gave the appearance of extreme distance and movement away from the earth. Observed by the naked eye, the object twinkled like a star.

3. Source says that two other witnesses saw the object. One is a CAA Communications man and the other is a weather observer who came on duty before daylight.

4. Source states that he was a pilot in the Troop Carrier Command during World War II and has 1800 hours in G-47 type aircraft. He has been a Weather Bureau observer since 1947. Source further states that this is the fifth unidentified flying object case since June 1950, although he did not report any previous cases. He gives this as the least spectacular of those previously observed.

5. No intercept action was taken.
