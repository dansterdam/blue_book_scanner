30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

I want to assure you we are not confused as to the color of the objects. The largest part of the time we watched them they looked to be a very light grey, then a few seconds before they left our sight, (possibly 8 or 7 seconds) they turned over two or three times and that's when they reflected the sunlight which caused them to sparkle and look silvery.
I wish I could estimate the height and speed of the objects for you, but as I told Captain Evans of the Stead Air Base, without knowing the actual size his guess would be as good as mine.

Now that I have answered your questions, I would like to ask you one. Don't you know more about these objects than you are letting us know?

Sincerely,

[Signature and name are redacted/blacked out]

Director of Intelligence
Hq. Tenth Air Force                     AFOIN FINDINGS 7-52                     1     2

1. As 0815, 3 August 1952, AIRMAN THIRD CLASS GARY L. DAMON was returning to
MANITOU BEACH, from MANITOU BEACH CAFE in MANITOU BEACH when he observed a brilliant, white light flash past in the sun direction as he was going. AIRMAN DAMON was heading east and was about one (1) mile from a junction of highway 22 at BONE CENTER, MICHIGAN. The light or object was south of his position, about three hundred (300) feet from the road and seemed to be approximately twenty (20) feet in diameter traveling at an altitude of twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) feet parallel to the ground. AIRMAN DAMON states that he watched the light or object for approximately ten (10) seconds and then suddenly it traveled about two hundred (200) feet in a horizontal course to the east and disappeared from sight. There seemed to be a brief and sharp increase of speed, and AIRMAN DAMON was unable to determine the speed or exact shape although it seemed to be circular.

2. AIRMAN DAMON stopped his car at the approximate location that he last observed the light or object and investigated to see if any damage had been done to the vegetation as might be caused by heat, but there was none.

3. Approximately forty (40) seconds later, another light or object appeared about three hundred (300) or four hundred (400) feet up the road from AIRMAN DAMON's position and traveled in the same direction. This light or object was identical to the first observed but appeared to dive to an altitude of twenty-five (25) or thirty (30) feet, travel horizontally for four hundred (400) to five hundred (500) feet and then disappear. This light or object was observed for about five (5) or six (6) seconds and appeared to be a light or object on the road.

4. AIRMAN DAMON states that there was no vegetation, hill or any object that could have been responsible for the appearance or disappearance of the lights or objects. The disappearance of the lights or objects was such as a light being suddenly turned off.

5. AIRMAN DAMON states that there were no farm houses in the vicinity and no passing motorists to verify his sightings.

TENTH AIR FORCE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE COMMENTS:

1. AIRMAN DAMON is assigned as DRAFTSMAN for the DEPUTY FOR OPERATIONS and is considered by his superiors to be both competent and reliable.

2. No local aircraft were in the vicinity at the time of sighting.

3. The 661st ACGN SQUADRON at SELFRIDGE AIR FORCE BASE indicated no unusual radar observations.

4. Weather and winds at time of sighting:

    a. Weather
        (1) Visibility - 4 to 5 miles; ground fog in patches
        (2) Clouds - Negative

    (9) 40,000' - 320°/32 knots
    (10) 50,000' - 310°/36 knots

5. The undersigned officer interprets the sighting as a reflection of manmade light which was suddenly turned off, appeared again and was turned off again.

7 August 1952

At approximately 0915S, 3 August 1952, while returning to Adrian, Michigan, in my car, I noticed a brilliant white light or object flash past travelling in the same direction as I. I was heading out on the Manitou Beach road, approximately one (1) mile from Junction 223 at Manitou Beach, Michigan. The light was moving south (60) feet from the road. It's diameter appeared to be about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) feet and it travelled at an altitude of twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) feet and seemed to be stationary at ground.

During the few seconds, probably not more than two (2), it travelled about two hundred (200) feet in a horizontally straight course eastward and disappeared from sight. The light was very brilliant, there seemed to be no trailing or haze around the light. The light or object seemed to be rapidly changing shape but it seemed to be circular.

I stopped immediately, at the approximate location I last observed the light or object, and investigated to see if any damage was done to the vegetation or might be caused by heat. There was none.

About forty (40) seconds later, another light or object appeared three hundred (300) feet to four hundred (400) feet on the road. It travelled in the same direction as the first, approximately six hundred (600) feet from the road. This light or object, identical to the first, was observed by me for about five (5) or six (6) seconds. It seemed to dive to an altitude of twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) feet and travelled parallel to the ground for four hundred (400) to five hundred (500) feet and then disappeared.

I further wish to state that no vegetation, hill, or man-made object was responsible for the lights or objects disappearing from sight but it was in the light now been studied currently off.

There were no farm houses in the vicinity and no passing motorists for verification of these sightings.
