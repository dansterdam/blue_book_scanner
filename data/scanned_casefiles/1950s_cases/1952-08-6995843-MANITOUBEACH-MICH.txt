I want to assure you we are not confused as to the color of the objects. This is part of the time we watched them they looked to be a very light grey or white, for a few seconds before they turned over two or three times and that's when they reflected the sunlight that cased them to appear brighter (possibly as bright as 7.2 seconds) they turned over again two or three times and that's when they reflected the sunlight and appeared to have a different color or brighter as the report states.

Now that I have answered your questions, I would like to ask you one. Don't you know more about these objects than you are letting us know?

Sincerely,
_<redacted>_

Director of Intelligence
Mr. Torn Air Force
AIRMAN DAMOB 7-22

AERIAL MICHIGAN, MANITOU BEACH along the MANITOU BEACH ROAD in his car. The object was first observed while he was driving along Manitou Beach Road, approximately 10 yards south of his position.

(2) observed the light to be stationary at first, then it started moving, making a slight circling motion, then disappearing, then reappearing to the south of his position.

(3) stated the light appeared to be hovering at a low altitude of approximately twenty-five (25) feet. It remained stationary for approximately thirty (30) seconds.

(4) estimated the diameter of the light object to be approximately thirty (30) feet.

(5) ent to be circular in shape, with no sound or exhaust emanating from it.

So, AIRMAN DAMOR stopped his car at the approximate location that he last observed the light or object and investigated to see if any damage had been done to the car.

Approximately one (1) or two (2) seconds later, another light or object appeared approximately forty (40) yards south of AIRMAN DAMOR'S position and traveled in an arc of ninety (90) degrees or more at altitudes varying from twenty-five (25) to three hundred (300) feet. This light or object was observed for approximately sixty (60) seconds and then disappeared.

AIRMAN DAMOR states that there were no farm houses in the vicinity and no passing motorists to verify his sightings.

TENTH AIR FORCE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE COMET:
1. AIRMAN DAMOR is assigned as a DRAFTSMAN for the DEPUTY FOR OPERATIONS and is considered by the USAF as reliable and responsible.

2. No local aircraft were in the vicinity at the time of sightings.

3. This GOES AMCF SQUADRON at SHEFFIELD AIR FORCE BASE indicated no unusual radar observations.

4. Weather conditions at time of sightings:
(1) Visibility - 4 to 5 miles; ground fog in patches
(2) Clouds - Negative

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, dated August 7, 1952.

The text in the document is as follows:

At approximately 0615, 3 August 1952, while returning to Adrian, Michigan, a brilliant white light or object flash past traveling in the same direction as I. It was heading east at an estimated speed from Manitou Beach, Mich., to Wamplers Lake, Mich., about thirty (30) miles away. The object was south of me and appeared to be at an altitude of twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) feet and was parallel to the ground for four hundred (400) feet.

During the few seconds, probably not more than two (2), it travelled considerably faster than any jet-propelled aircraft I have ever seen. The light was brilliant white, brilliantly illuminating the ground beneath it. The object did not seem to have any specific shape or outline.

About forty (40) seconds later, another light or object appeared three hundred (300) feet to four hundred (400) feet up the road. It travelled in the same manner and direction as the first object, and was also brilliantly illuminated. Once again, no definite shape or outline could be seen.

I further wish to state that no vegetation, hill, or man-made object was responsible for this sighting, as my vision was unobstructed. The objects appeared to disappear suddenly.

There were no farm houses in the vicinity and no passing motorists for verification of these sightings.
