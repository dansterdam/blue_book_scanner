(1) One object, round but size undetermined, however observer stated that object larger than conventional aircraft. Object gave off a luminous color, somewhat like a glowing diamond that in turn changed according to observers brief view. No trail, exhaust, or sound was noticed by observers. Object hovered directly overhead at approximately 5,000 feet and upon approach of a C-97 aircraft made a rapid ascent to approximately 10,000 feet. Object disappeared by moving off laterally at a tremendous rate of speed, many times faster than conventional aircraft, according to observers.

(2) Time of sighting was approximately 1000 hours, CST, 30 July 1952. Object was seen for approximately thirty minutes.

(3) A visual surface observation without optical or electronic equipment was made.

Object observed at [redacted] San Antonio, just two blocks South of [redacted]

(4) Object was observed by [redacted] a civilian employee at Kelly AF Base, and his brother, a retired Civil Service employee. Observers are well-known members of the Investigation Section, Kelly Air Police Office, and are completely reliable.

Weather conditions prevailed at the time of the sighting.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. At approximately 214.7 on 20 July 1952, unidentified moving lights were observed in the sky in the vicinity of Ashiya Air Base, Kyushu, Japan. The lights were first sighted low on the horizon in an easterly direction from the Air Base, estimated position in the vicinity of the town of Kokura. First appearance was a slow circular motion to the moon as seen through a hata newspaper or a pair of field glasses. The light was white and as big as a star in the west at the time and no beam of light projected from the ground was visible. The light was kept under observation. OF APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE the light suddenly disappeared and then reappeared slightly higher and moved to a position estimated to be over the east line at which point it was under observation for approximately the same time. Movement was smooth. In another instance, as the light moved toward the west, its size was greatly increased until it passed approximately one mile to the north. Its position at this time was estimated at 500 feet altitude, slightly west of Himeji. It moved at a reasonably steady pace of approximately 200 feet per hour. The altitude configuration was between 300 and 500 feet. The area of time is estimated to have been between 1900 and 2000. The sky was a haze of light, from the ground or any other source of light detected. Sky condition was broken.

2. After approximately 45 seconds a light similar in appearance except for its size appeared and then two lights to east and passed directly overhead at approximately the same altitude. This light was maneuvered with the classical pointed in the direction of wave and with the light sign pointing at least 300 feet in length trailing behind. The speed at this time was estimated at 500 feet in height moving in excess of 500 miles per hour and the speed of the light was estimated to be considerably greater than that.

3. After passing overhead the light returned to the approximate location in which first observed and resumed the appearance of the light. First observed after remaining stationary for a few seconds. The light moved from west to east with movements from side to side but with little change in altitude. No movements were erratic. The light was similar to those seen by the reflection of the base of a search light. The light is being tracked by radar. It was manipulated variously. All movements at this time were estimated to be to the west with no wild or erratic movements. During this period of time more appeared to be going on than could be readily explained. Also several lights were observed. A search team of four men was sent out to investigate but was not able to make any definite observations. The light was not seen to go down the only horizontally from the said light.

4. After approximately two minutes the light maintained no movement. From this point the light's position was evident.

5. There was no sound at any time.

7. I am aware of the location of the Yahata Steel Mills in the approximate area in which the light was observed for the greatest period of time and am familiar with the flow in the sky southeast of the blast. Terrace. This light was entirely different in appearance and is not believed to have been the result of any industrial activity in this area. The light was definitely not a weather balloon. Air Currents even during a Typhoon would not be capable of causing the rapid movement observed.

8. If the light was the reflection of a searchlight beam, then the source must have been many miles offshore due to the distance traveled by the light. This possibility was ruled out due to the absence of a visible beam or light coming from the earth's surface. By the change in shape to "V" appearance when moving at high speed and by the relatively constant intensity and altitude of the light when the sky condition was broken and not a solid overcast.

9. Intelligence Officers Comments: The Sighting referred to in this report was identical, by several other Airmen at Itazuke base. Statements by persons witnessing this incident were very similar and different only in detail.

10. Weather during time of sighting was scattered clouds 3,000 ft., ceiling 15,000 ft., visibility 10 miles, wind S. S. W. at 10 knots.

1. On 27 July 1952 at 2305 hours M/Sgt. and S/Sgt. locked out the window of barracks C-50 and at an angle of 45° saw what appeared to be a falling star. Object appeared on the horizon at a 45° angle and ascended to an angle of 75° at 45 seconds. It was approximately 10,000 feet above the ground. The object approached from the South Southeast came within 1 mile of the base, it stopped, stayed 15 minutes in the same place. Moved to its right about 1 mile and then went back to the Southeast and disappeared on the horizon. The object left the area at a terrific speed. It reached the horizon in a matter of seconds.

2. Disk looked like a large pale yellow grapefruit (of white color, very bright). No visible means of propulsion. Object gave off no light. Was round in shape and color. No noise. No cloud cover in the immediate area. Some thin cumulo form clouds on the horizon. Object became larger as it approached. Stars could be seen faintly behind the object. The entire sighting approximately lasted (1) minute. The 2700 news cast was just coming on when the object was sighted. The object was approximately 3 to 4 inches across. The object was about 2/3 the size of the red obstruction lights on the runway appeared to be swinging a low sweeping curve downward toward the horizon. While hovering the object appeared to be executing small tight circles.

3. Weather during the of sighting was estimated 17,000 ft. broken, visibility 10 miles, wind S. W. 5 knots.
