34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 Nov 1967
    Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

#19 Question is not explained very well. The muscle part of the light did not move in the middle part more the angle that I saw. And it turned, again.

Something moved into pattern - the angle - it moved in the regular like it was turning or an angle - but the light path showed something I could not understand.

Stopped moving (the middle part) & then picked the changing glow & took off.

My husband did not want to go on the sighting - So he was not there being
case place do not want him - but I doubt to report it before - So I feel better about it
anyway. I assumed it was something over
country being so that did not been to con-
clude & I am still not concerned - and I still
stand at liberty to say, on thing I am real.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of its path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Dear Sirs,

I am sending you the account of a UFO sighting experienced by my husband and myself some years ago. I hope it will interest you.

I am a writer and editor, currently under contract to Doubleday in New York.

My husband is a business in Richmond, Indiana, where our home is located.

Thank you.

Very truly yours,

[Signature is blacked out]

Richmond, Indiana
November 9, 1966

My experience with a UFO occurred 10 years ago, on September 15, 1956.

On this day I was scheduled to address the Woman's Press Club of Indiana as its after-luncheon speaker in the French Lick-Sheraton Hotel at French Lick, Indiana. (I am a Doubleday author and frequently serve as a speaker for church, civic, and women's groups, conventions and service clubs.)

Because of the distance from Richmond to French Lick, my husband and I left early in the morning. It was a very unpleasant morning, extremely dark, with pounding rain and beating winds. At daylight we were in southern Indiana, and it was there that we saw the UFO.

At the time, we were approaching Salem, Indiana. I do not know the exact time, but it was between 6 and 7 a.m., closer, I think, to 6 a.m. The rain was now only a misty drizzle, but the morning was wet and gray.

We came up an incline to a sort of hilltop (I do not know the exact location) which looked out over a flat area of fields and fences as I recall. My husband was driving, intent upon the wet road. I looked out to the left and saw, hovering over the flat area, a flying saucer!

At first I was too surprised and startled to speak at all.


- page 7 -

I stared, unable to believe my eyes, thinking I must be mistaken
....but no, there it was! So I stammered to my husband, "Look out
there quick! Do you see....what I think I see?"

He took one look and brought the car to a stop. We sat
there on the hilltop (or rise) and stared. I said, amazed, "Why
it's a Flying Saucer! It is....isn't it?" My husband, who is very
conservative, answered, "Well, it certainly appears to be something
like that!"

My first impression was that it looked something like a
gunmetal yo-yo. It appeared to be made of two sections of dark gun-
metal with an aperture between them. From this aperture, as if from
windows, port-holes, or similar openings, came wisps of white smoke or
vapor which seemed carried slightly to one side by the wind. The UFO
was hovering, as I have described, but constantly undulating as it
hovered. (Please see amateurish drawing, attached.)

At this moment, we became aware of another car coming up
behind us and my husband, hoping for another witness, leaped out and
tried to flag it down. The driver, a man, gave him a scared look and
sped on. Two or three other cars came from behind us (perhaps people
going to work) and my husband tried to stop them, with the same result.
We both shouted and pointed toward the UFO, but the passengers sped
on without looking at it. We were disappointed, but not surprised.
Nobody wants to be stopped on a lonely road in the rain at the dawn's
early light by a couple of excited and gesticulating strangers! (The
road was lonely only at this hour, however. It is a well-traveled
highway.)

At least 5 minutes passed while we watched the UFO, perhaps


- page 8 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

10 minutes. Then, all of a sudden, it turned on one edge, like a plate on a wall, and VANISHED!

I say "vanished" because never, in all my life, have I seen anything move so fast. My husband and I have mentioned this many times, and agree that the speed with which this object disappeared into the distance was indescribable, inconceivable, if not actually impossible!

It reminded me a little, but only a little, of the movie cartoon which shows one person chasing another up a road. Suddenly ...whsst!....both are out of sight. But even this, which seems funny to audiences because it is such an exaggeration, would seem slow by comparison with our UFO.

As it vanished, it held the position I have mentioned, turned on one edge like a plate on a wall, or on a sideboard. We could no longer see the aperture, or the smoke (?) wisps.

More than once we have tried to estimate the size of the UFO and its distance from us. This is hard to do, since events moved so rapidly, and we can only agree that it was "quite close" to us and that it was "very, VERY large." I have read many journalistic jibes about "little green men flying around in little saucer-machines" but had no such impression of this "saucer machine."

Most accounts say the witnesses were "terrified"..."transfixed with horror"...."speechless with fear"...and so on. (More journalistic Esperanto, perhaps.) It does seem natural to feel frightened by such an "abnormal" sight, but my husband and I felt no fear whatever, nor any apprehension whatever. We didn't see any


- page 9 -

"little green men" or expect to see any, though of course we assumed that the craft was being piloted "by somebody." I think we both felt that it was probably some sort of military craft being tested by the United States Air Force, and publicly un-announced as yet.

About its size....we agree that it was "about the size of the court house" which, in Richmond, is a mighty big court house!

When we reached French Lick I related this experience to Hortense Myers, Indianapolis INS editor, and assistant chairman of the Press Women's convention. She told me they had been asked not to publish such reports, and advised me to say nothing about it. (To tell you the truth, I don't think she believed me.)

It has been more than 10 years since then, of course, and we have read many reports about UFO experiences during this time, but have had no more such experiences ourselves. Nor have we read any accounts which described the "gunmetal color" we saw, or the wisps of smoke (?) or vapor (?) emitted from the center opening. And because there is a very serious interest in investigating UFO accounts at this time, I decided to send you mine.

Craft a dark gunmetal, very large in size.
Center aperture a darker color, as if recessed, almost black.
Wisps of something like vapor or smoke emitted from center aperture as if through portholes, windows, or similar openings. Trailing to one side in the wind.

Place: Near Salem, Indiana, September 15, 1956, soon after daylight.

Case 221, St Paul, Minn., Sept. 22, 1956—Said the St.
Paul Dispatch: "Residents in the area of Mendota and
Mendel discussed a mystery light from a small molten
mass that burned a hole in the street surface and lit up
the neighborhood at 12:30 a.m. George White said he
witnessed at that hour to find his room as light as from a
ceiling light. He noted that the light came from the intersection but when it died out a few minutes later he went
back to sleep. The morning residents found a hole about

1 block from new castle, Dak.

2 p.m. Police departments of a dozen communities were
brought with calls reporting the explosion. Seitzberg
AFB authorities said there was only one jet lying at the
time in the Detroit area and it had not broken the sound
barrier."

[The rest of the text appears to be a detailed narrative about a UFO sighting, but parts of it are slightly blurry. Here's the text I can confidently read:]

CRIFO, Mrs. A. A. Flowers writes: "... I was up to draw to the Drive-in for the first show about 8:20 p.m.

At approximately 9 p.m. I saw a sharp blue light west of the screen. Its movements were erratic, darting downward, instantly reversing and going back west. I watched to make certain the object could not be a firefly caught in the projection beam. I couldn't have been for I was the last car in the far west side, therefore what I saw was moving behind the screen, where the beam could not reach. By the time we left the movie, there were four of these lights, all in an area extending over about three degrees, all performing the exact maneuver...

1956, Sept. 22--Grand Rapids, Michigan--4pm: Two tan, delta-shaped UFOs seen by Pilot from his plane. Passed below him, smaller than his ship. Not birds or balloons, he said. They traveled fast!

Case #: Grand Rapids, Mich. Sept. 22, 1956--According to the Grand Rapids Herald a pilot said strange objects observed by his plane near the Grand Rapids Airport Tuesday afternoon. William Morton, the pilot, who was returning to Grand Rapids from South Bend, told the following story: "Around 4 p.m. between Fort and Byron Center and at about 120 miles altitude 2000 feet, I was approaching the field when something went by under my right wing going like the merry blaze. I got a good view for a second and then saw a second object pass under my right wing. I made a turn to get a better glimpse but they were gone. The first object I saw was tan, had a Delta wing shape and appeared to be smaller than any Cessna plane, but considerably larger than any large bird of any sort. The objects were going due south and they positively weren't weather balloons."

Case 225, Cincinnati, Ohio, Sept. 27, 1956--Said News Reporter, a local suburban weekly paper: "A Northern Ohio physician and wife, who shared their bedroom with a group of previously unknown flying saucer-like, multi-colored objects. The couple said they were awakened about 3 a.m. when a pane in their bedroom window set up a vibration. 'I got up to find out what was causing the noise,' the doctor said. 'At first I thought someone was trying to get into the window. Then I looked out and saw these objects that looked like little balls careening around in the sky... It was quite a spectacle. The balls were all colors--red, green, yellow and several colors that I can't describe. Then the objects just disappeared. It wasn't a gentle trailing off as you might expect to see when watching fireworks pop in the sky--the objects just seemed to be snatched into the void.' The doctor said he and his wife watched the demonstration for almost a half hour."

Case 226, Columbus, Ohio, Sept. 28, 1956—According to the Columbus Dispatch, a former air force pilot and local businessman said that he and his father witnessed eight cigar-shaped objects follow an airliner at 11:20 a.m. He said "The things were brighter than the aluminum on the plane." They followed themselves. Then they slowed suddenly, stopped and roved and themselves. Then they flew south for a short distance and then went up and out of sight. I won't identify myself because people will think I'm crazy."

Case 227. Norwich-Sydney area, New York, Sept. 28, 1956.—We quote from a letter received from Mrs. Kenneth Leslie, Binghamton, N. Y., as follows: "Last night between 9 p.m. and midnight some of residents witnessed a large object in the sky which turned from red to green to white and back again. It pulsated and remained a bright orange color for some time and then disappeared.

The State Police received a number of calls from disturbed residents, and after checking the object themselves they alerted Rome AFB. A squadron of jet fighters were scrambled and as yet no reports have been received as to what the object was or what they found. The story was broadcast over the newscasts of radio station WINR all day."
