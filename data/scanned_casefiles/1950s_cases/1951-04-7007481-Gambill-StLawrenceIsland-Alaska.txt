DTG:

No radar or air observations during period of incident queried in urnsg 2102/92 similar phenomena noted 13 and 29 Apr 50, 19 and 20 July 50, 8 Aug 50. Located between Bora Lysaya Golore and Cape Cherkaskogo are 2 confirmed and 3 probable coastal defense batteries of 6 guns each mounted in pairs. Evaluation of reported explosions by CINCAL is gunfire from above cited positions on target which was not observed from St Lawrence. Height of radar antenna at site 640 ft with horizon at 3° miles makes doubtful explosions were observed "in water off base of mountains." See AAC Intelligence Review Nbr 50-3 and Nbr 50-8, dtd 1 Mar and 15 Sep 50 for further details Gambell observations.

1. The following information was reported by a member of the first Alaska National Guard Scout Battalion at Gambell, Alaska.

a. On 16 August 1951, at 1500 W, approximately ten explosions were heard originating thirty-five to forty miles Northwest of Gambell.

b. Similar explosions were again noticed at 1645 W, that same day.

2. Informant believes that the explosions heard on these two occasions were caused by the firing of heavy guns, during the period of this incident foggy weather conditions existed with westerly winds.
