1. The following information was reported by a member of the First Alaska National Guard "sent Battalion" at Gambill, Alaska:

a. On 16 August 1951, at 1500 H, approximately ten explosions were heard originating thirty-five to forty miles northwest of Gambill.

b. Similar explosions were again noticed at 1642 H, that same day.

2. The informant believes that the explosions heard were in two two separate instances which he feels were caused by the rising, soaring noise, during the period of this incident, of this strange weather condition existed with "westerly winds".
