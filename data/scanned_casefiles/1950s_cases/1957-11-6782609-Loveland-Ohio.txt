Dear Mr. Mann:

We are in receipt of your letter dated 12 November in which you report an unidentified aerial object observed for 12 minutes near Loveland, Ohio on the evening of 11 November 1957. Our files also disclose previous correspondence from you dated 17 December 1952, 19 February 1954, 23 July 1954 and an undated letter in 1955.

A check with local facilities disclosed that a weather balloon was released southwest of your location just before 6:00 PM that the balloon was remaining lightly and that the winds were from the southwest and moving at 20 to 25 knots at the time of your sighting.

Although we cannot account for the cylindrical shape, experience with hundreds of similar reports has shown that balloons observed near towns or other built-up areas can readily be traced to orange or red burns orange appearing, due to the reflection of the sun's rays.

Attached please find official material from the Department of Defense regarding the Air Force's work in the field of unidentified flying objects.

Your prompt reporting and interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

HAROLD W. ELWOOD
Assistant Adjutant

Sir: I think I had better write this to you. Last evening at 6:00 P.M. I saw an orange colored object in the western sky 10° above the horizon. I stayed at home a new event but it was slowly moving.

I got a good view up on a flag pole and some playing field light pole. It slowly rose in the western sky and at 6:07 P.M. the object light went out but I could make out a dark object in the sky. It continued to rise and at 6:12 disappeared from sight.

Sincerely,
