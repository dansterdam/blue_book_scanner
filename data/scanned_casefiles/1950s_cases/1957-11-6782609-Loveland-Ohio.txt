Mr. Mann:
We are in receipt of your letter dated 12 November 1957 in which you advised that unidentified objects observed for 15 minutes near Loveland, Ohio on the evening of 6 November 1957. Our files also disclose that on 14 November 1957 you furnished additional information which was obtained in an interview on 14 November 1957, 19 February 1958.
A check with local facilities disclose that a weather balloon was passed southwest of your location just before 6:00 PM that the balloon was rising and drifting northwest and that the sighting and your report is consistent with this weather phenomenon.
Although we cannot account for the cylindrical shape, experience with hundreds of similar reports has shown that balloons observed near sunset or during twilight periods appear to have a variety of shapes due to the effects of the sun's rays.
Attached please find official from the Department of the Air Force regarding the Air Force's work in the field of unidentified flying objects.
Your prompt reporting and interest in this matter is appreciated.
Sincerely,
WALLACE W. ELWOOD
Colonel, USAF
Assistant Adjutant
