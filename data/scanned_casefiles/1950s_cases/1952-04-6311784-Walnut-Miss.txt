Report of unidentified flying object by Mr. [redacted] CIC agent, Naval Air Station, Millington, Tenn. reports he and daughter [redacted] sighted Unconventional Flying Object while enroute from Ripley, Miss., to Millington. Observers driving Northwest on Highway 72 about two miles from Walnut, Miss. Object sighted at daybreak on morning of 7 April 1952. Object appeared to be very bright with "brilliance of big arc light". Object was many times brighter than aircraft beacon nearby. Traveling too fast to estimate speed. Distance unestimated but object appeared to be smaller than full moon. Object appeared solid. Thinking object was meteor about to crash, observer stopped, and cut off engine. Observers expected crash but object disappeared behind pine trees. Object made no sound, left no trail or exhaust. 516th Wing Comments: Daughter confirmed report. She is employed (garbled) Commissioner Leslie Nicholson, Memphis. Both sources appear reliable, veracity appears unquestionable to this interviewer.

Report released by INS described "fireball" sighted, Macon, Mo., about 350 airline miles NW/ Memphis early morning 7 April 1952. Considering position of this sighting two objects possibly could have been one and same.

SUBJECT    Unidentified Flying Objects

PREPARED BY    Julio J. Laurenzi, Captain, USAF            INFO. RECEIVED BY    Maj Ray H. Manger, Patterson AFB, Memphis

SUMMARY:
At 0445 hours 7 April 1952, Mrs. [name redacted] of Parkview Hotel, Memphis, claimed to have seen an unidentified flying object traveling in her view in the heart of the city at a speed many times that of commercial aircraft then seen in the same vicinity. Although distances was undetermined, observer estimated a distance of two to four miles. It appeared larger than a full moon and larger than aircraft at a similar distance. The object appeared to have a reddish-amber color and left a vapor trail. It appeared to arc slightly in its trajectory.

The weather was clear and warm and the morning of the sighting the observer was sitting before a large picture window looking north over the city as dawn was just breaking to break. She reported having arisen early to see her husband off on a business trip.

The source of the information is 38 years old and was class while reading. She is this wife of a business executive and by all indications, reliable and rational.

1. It is highly probable that this observer sighted some unconventional material object.

Comments: Mrs. [name redacted] remained adamant during questioning. However, she expressed a great deal of interest in other sightings and had read recent publicity regarding same. Two reports at nearly the same time lend credibility to this report. Mrs. [name redacted] did not have knowledge of the other sightings (see report No. 2-52 516th Troop Carrier Wing Intelligence).

TWD: 516 TCGW-WINF-6-8

Mr. C. C. Smith and daughter, while driving, report sighting an unconventional flying object while en route from Ripley, Miss., to Killington, Tenn., while driving on Highway 72 approaching Walnut, Miss.

Object was sighted just at daybreak on the morning of 7 April 1952. The object appeared very bright with a "brilliant" or a big arc light near it in the east. It was many times brighter than an aircraft beacon nearby. Although the object was traveling too fast to calculate speed, it stayed in sight long enough to stop the car and observe it indicating that it was a great distance away. The distance is unestimated, but the object appeared smaller than a full moon. It appeared to be solid.

Thinking it was a meteor about to crash, the observers pulled to a stop and cut engine. They observed the object as a crash which did not occur. The object was still visible when pine trees beside the road obstructed their vision. Exact shape of the object was not described because of its brilliance. It made no sound and left no vapor trail or exhaust.

Because of the vivid descriptions given, it is possible the observers sighted a material flying object.

COMMENTS: Mr. C. C. Smith is a CID agent at Naval Air Station, Millington, Tenn. His daughter is an employee of U. S. Consultant Lockheed Aircraft, Memphis. Both appear reliable, and their veracity appeared unquestionable.

A report released by International News Service describes a "fireball" sighted at 1:00 a.m. 30 April 1952 in Memphis, early morning of 7 April 1952, considering the position of this sighting the object could possibly have been the same. A third report, reference Report No. 2-52, 516 TCW, appears to sit in the same flight pattern of the above reported object.
