PAGE THREE RJTOAK 49A

1. NONE. J. SEE COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER. Ko. COMMENT OF
CAPTAIN B. K. HERBRUCK, DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, 7272D AIR BASE

WING: SIGHTINGS WERE MADE INDEPENDENTLY. OBSERVERS WERE ON
ADJACENT BALCONIES OF ADJACENT SECOND-STORY APARTMENTS SEPARATED
BY A HIGH WALL. THOUGH THERE WAS MUCH LOCAL JET TRAFFIC AT THE
HOUR OF OBSERVATIONS, THERE WAS NO ACCOMPANYING NOISE BEFORE,
DURING, OR AFTER THE SIGHTING. OBSERVER STATED THAT OBJECT WAS
TOO BLUE AND PATH TOO HORIZONTAL FOR FALLING OR SHOOTING STAR.
NO EVIDENCE OF SEARCHLIGHT, OR CEILOMETER ACTIVITY IN AREA. ONE
OBSERVER COMPARED LIGHT TO THE EXPLODING OF AN ELECTRIC TRANSFORMER.
BUT THIS SIGHTING WAS ABOVE LEVEL OF POWER LINES. POSSIBLE EXPLANATION MIGHT BE OPTICAL ILLUSION CAUSED BY TEMPERATURE INVERSION
IN ATMOSPHERE REPORTED ABOVE. PERSONNEL LIVING IN SAME AREA ARE
BEING QUESTIONED AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL FOLLOW IF WARRANTED.

2. NONE.
