Dear Sir;

On January 2, at about 2200, Mrs. [redacted] and observed what we believe to be one of the "Flying Saucers".

It was visible for a period of about three minutes, at an estimated altitude of 35°, bearing about 340° true from a point in Brooklyn, in approximate Latitude 40° 41'N, Longitude 73° 58'W.

It was in the clouds, remaining stationary and emitting a bluish flag glow. For a period of about 30 seconds, the intensity of the glow was very marked.

If this information is of any value to you, I shall be pleased to continue to be on watch for these effects.

Sincerely yours,
[signature redacted]
