1. On 16 August 1958 the above individual telephoned this District Office and advised that he and his wife were attending a drive-in movie when his wife, about 2300 on 4 August 1958, called his attention to an unidentified flying object (UFO). He thought it was a satellite but about fifteen minutes later an identical UFO came into view. Described both objects as being elliptical in shape and very brilliant, and when first noticed were in the west-northwest and disappeared at the horizon in the southwest. He further advised that the drive-in movie is located at Troy Hill, New Jersey, and that at the time the objects were sighted the night was clear and visibility good.

2. [Redacted] further advised that he had discussed this incident with two friends, Mr. [Redacted] of Whippany, New Jersey and a Mr. [Redacted] (phonetic) who is a purchasing agent for Mr. [Redacted] Industries. Mr. [Redacted] was in Lake George, New York, on the night of 4 August 1958 and his son was in a camp in Newton, New Jersey, and both these individuals saw a UFO on that night.
