Dear Sirs:

Due to the recent information being released by magazines and such else me to believe that I'll might as well tell you of my experience years ago. I realize that this might be just another letter to throw in the trash can, but I have nothing to lose or gain, so I'll start at the beginning.

I first saw this "object" about 1956. I'm not exactly sure, but I think it was winter time. Anyway, I was with a girlfriend taking an afternoon ride. We were somewhere on route 52 outside of Philadelphia, around 5 P.M. The area was wound there at the time was some fields with a horse magic every couple hundred yards or so. I haven't been these for years, so I'm not sure exactly where it was.

I was heading back towards Phila. where we both lived at the time. Thinking with something was it was winter time, I was at getting dark. I remember it was talking when my girl said "What are those lights I see ahead?" I was looking back and said "Oh maybe a helicopter or something." We were getting closer all the time. My girl said, "It's not a helicopter, we would have heard it." I said, "Well, maybe it's a TV tower." But we could both see that these lights were directly over a corn field off the right side of the road, and there was definitely something there. We both got out and looked from the shelter of the road, and the best I can describe this object would be about 150 feet up of the ground, it was...

Here is the text from the document:

about the size of a bread truck. It had 2 or 3 lights on it somewhere. I can't now. Maybe they were red & green & white, but like, I say, I can't really remember for sure. Just about then a light like a search light came down on the field and started to shine towards my car. I mean to tell you that my girl and I jumped back into the car fast. The light did shine over my car, across the road and onto the field on the other side, then the light went off and this object just went over top the hill in the direction I that the light had shone. No noise. Just ZIP.

We drove away, and I just went around the light I sure I came to there here about 5 cars grouped on the side, and the people were all out of their cars looking up. Apparently they did know what it was. I did not tell anyone or they would say I was crazy or something. If you got about 1/2 mile or another 100 yards when the switch of the track was turned and the field was stopped. But write all these with the whole story. You can take it for what it's worth. I just thought it about time I tell it. Someone is now dying in New York State somewhere.

Sincerely,
[Signature area is blacked out]
