SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:

1. A check with Syracuse GOC Filter Center revealed that SOURCE'S report was the only one received concerning the sighting of this object.

2. The 655th ACW Squadron located at Watertown, New York indicated that there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. Interception and identification action taken by the 655th ACW Squadron was negative. Object was not painted on radar screens. According to the 655th ACW Squadron, SOURCE'S report through Syracuse GOC Filter Center was the only one received during the period of sighting.

3. The information received from the U.S.A.F. Weather Office at Syracuse A.F. Station, Syracuse, New York (Gulf 5204) indicated wind direction and velocity in degrees and knots as follows:
Surface         115° - 3 to 5                   20,000' - 280° - 70
6,000'          230 - 40                        30,000' - 290 - 90
10,000'         280 - 10                        50,000' - 290 - 50
1,000'          280 - 60                        80,000' - 230 - 30

(The above constituted the winds at approximately 06/0002 Mar 56.)
At 06/0130 Mar 56, ceiling was 25,000 feet, clouds broken; visibility seven miles.
At 06/0230 Mar 56, the ceiling was 13,000 feet, clouds broken to 25,000 feet, overcast; visibility seven miles.

4. Weather officer at Syracuse A.F. Station stated that due to prevailing winds, weather balloons released from Buffalo, New York (GRN 1055) area, and other stations west of Syracuse, New York, could have been carried into the vicinity of the sighting.

5. A check with the U. S. Weather Bureaus at Syracuse, New York and Niagara Falls, New York (Gulf 5204), revealed that additional weather balloons were released daily at 1130, 2030, 0230, and 0830. Mr. G. R. Wright of the U. S. Weather Bureau office at Buffalo stated that balloons reached 80,000 feet in an hour's time, and upon attaining this altitude, burst with resulting complete rupture. Further, a fully balloon, which would not attain this altitude, and therefore not bursting, would be subject to prevailing air currents. Mr. Wright further stated that such a balloon could be readily observed up to 10,000 feet on a clear night.

6. A check with Dr. Fredrickson of the Syracuse University Observatory, Syracuse, New York revealed that there were no unusual phenomena observed during sighting period. Dr. Fredrickson further stated that the planet Jupiter was coming up in the east at the time of sighting. Dr. Fredrickson, also, stated that several weeks ago a friend had called him about an unusually bright light in the sky nearly over the campus. Upon investigation, the object turned out to be the Observatory's telescope, Dr. Fredrickson saw that it was definitely a balloon. Dr. Fredrickson was quite impressed with the brightness that the balloon emitted and its similarity to a star as seen by the naked eye.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight: B-D, 4602d AISS
Comments of Preparing Officer:

1. Preparing Officer concludes that this sighting was probably caused by an illuminated weather balloon, for the following reasons:

a. Prevailing winds prior to time of sighting could have placed weather balloons in areas of sighting released from weather stations as far west as Buffalo, New York, Niagara Falls, New York and vicinity.

b. The description of the balloon hypothesis as described in Squadron Guide 200-2, Part II, page 7, coincides with SOURCE'S description of object.

c. Due to negative radar contact.

d. Possible error in SOURCE'S reported sighting time, could have resulted in object having been a locally released illuminated weather balloon.

e. Although the planet Jupiter rises in the east at this time, it would have been observed for a longer period of time. Likewise, Jupiter would not have faded away as described by SOURCE. Also, it is similarly that Jupiter would move in a manner as object's movement was described by SOURCE.

f. Although certain aspects of the lighting corresponded to the star hypothesis, I do not consider this object to be a star due to motion and brightness of object as described by SOURCE.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by an illuminated weather balloon.

Flight 3-D, 46024 AISS                                    Part One    PAGE 2 OF 9 PAGES

I.   SOURCE:
     Address: [redacted] Bridgeport, New York
     Age: 44
     Occupation: Mechanic
     Education: 10 years
     Qualifications: Qualified automobile mechanic; former US Army
                     Air Corps aircraft mechanic.

II.  RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a mild-mannered man of middle age. He was
since in his statement and was very conversant. Having been in the Army Air
Corps during WW II and currently interested in GOC Filter Center activities, he
was considered a reliable informant. SOURCE has no apparent ulterior motives.
His promptness in reporting the sighting to the Filter Center is worthy of mention.
SOURCE's statement was confidential to the reliable investigator.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE, having retired early for the
night of 5 March 56, was awakened by his wife at 06/3052, who had initially sighted
the object at 06/0354 Mar 56. (See Part II)

     During the twenty minute period of sighting, SOURCE, the object appeared
to swing to and fro as if attached to a pendulum. Simultaneously, it appeared to
rise slowly but sharply. SOURCE likened the object to looking directly into a large
incandescent bulb and vividly describing your eyes. The image that appeared in that
split second after your eyes close is exactly the appearance that the object in
question gave to SOURCE. According to SOURCE, the object had a very bright center,
blurred edges and appeared to be about the size of a small pea held at arm length.

     During entire period of observation, the sky was dark with a few stars and
no moonlight. At no time did the object move behind any visual obstruction. However,
the object did at times obstruct SOURCE'S vision of one particularly bright star.
This star was positively positioned east by SOUTHS as being in the direction
as the sun rises. The night was cool (about 40°F) with a very slight breeze.

     SOURCE heard no sound from object, color remained constant, white center
with pinkish yellow exterior and no flickering or fading. No wave trails or exhaust
were visible. It's shape, that of a ball, remained constant at all times during
observation. While it never appeared to increase or decrease its speed to any
perceptible degree, it was ever moving with a pendulum motion.

After going to bed early I was awoken by my wife watching this object in the sky. Being that I work across from the filter center on Mitchel Ave. in Syracuse and my interest in the service I went to the window and watched this object for about ten minutes, then made up my mind I should call the filter center and report the same in case it was abnormal. I have been familiar with planes etc. and in the service myself, and had never seen such a thing in all my service night or day flying and it caused me quite a bit of disturbance. I can't add any more to what I told the officer on my report, so I will leave this report the same, just like the image of a light bulb.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-D, 1602d AISS

I. SOURCE:
Address: Bridgeport, New York
Age: 44
Occupation: Assembly line worker, Auto Lite Corp.
Education: 8 years

Qualifications: SOURCE was a pleasant middle age woman, who appeared to be very sincere and most willing to cooperate with investigators. SOURCE considered the sighting pertinent to the welfare of the nation and answered investigators questions in accordance with her feelings.

II. RELIABILITY: Information received from SOURCE was reliable within the limits of her ability.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE, having retired for the night of 5 March 56, noticed a bright light through the bedroom window which gave the appearance of a very bright star. SOURCE arrived home at 1:06 GMT at Line to base 061056. No. 56. After watching object for a few minutes, SOURCE awakened her husband and both of them decided to investigate.

During the twenty-five minutes of observing this object, SOURCE stated that there was a few stars out but she did not remember if the moon was visible or not. SOURCE stated that object was brighter than the rest of the sky and had the appearance of an automobile head light approximately one mile away. SOURCE viewed object through ordinary window glass.

SOURCE described object as round, made of solid material, emitting a yellowish glow which seemed to flicker at times. According to SOURCE, edges of object seemed to be fuzzy or blurred. SOURCE stated that object had the appearance of a kite made of material that would glow.

Lake (near ONEIDA): SOURCE stated that object was sighted due east of her home over Oneida Lake. SOURCE explained that object seemed to move in a pendulum like motion and then up and down, finally going up to the southeast and fading from her sight. SOURCE was certain the size of the object could be compared to a quarter had length.

SOURCE described the weather at time of sighting as being dry, cool, little or no wind with scattered clouds. SOURCE, also, stated that her husband had sighted object and reported it to Syracuse Police Center, Syracuse, New York.

According to SOURCE, this was the first time she had seen such an object.

After retiring I saw through the window what appeared to be a star. After watching it for a few minutes it seemed to move very slowly up at a better word and after a few minutes float back down and then it moved back and forth as a pendulum after repeating this several times about 5 in all. It moved up to the right and faded out.
