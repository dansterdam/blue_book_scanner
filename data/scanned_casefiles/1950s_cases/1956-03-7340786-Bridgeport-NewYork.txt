AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE: 30-10-55-2-56                     PART THREE      S.D.

1. A check with Dr. Frederickson of the Syracuse University Observatory revealed that SORAC's report was the only one received at the time of sighting. Dr. Frederickson stated that he usually receives many reports when anything of this kind is reported, and he has not received any other reports. 

2. The information received from the U.S.A.F. Weather office at Syracuse A.F. Station stated that due to prevailing winds at Syracuse, any balloons released in the Albany, New York, area could have been carried into the vicinity of the sighting.

3. A check with Dr. Frederickson of the Syracuse University Observatory revealed that all illuminated weather balloons and other high altitude objects are regularly tracked by radar at that Observatory. Dr. Frederickson stated that on the date of the sighting, October 2, 1955, no such objects were tracked by the Observatory radar, during the period of the sighting.

4. A check with Mr. Wright further stated that such a balloon could have been released somewhere near Albany, New York, and could have been observed during the period of the sighting near Bridgeport, New York.

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FLIGHT 3-9, ACCA 41233
DESCRIPTION OF REPORTING WITNESSES

1. Preparing officer concludes that this sighting was probably caused by an illuminated weather balloon. 

2. Prevailing winds prior to time of sighting would have placed weather balloons 28 miles southwest rather than over the area as reported.

3. The description of the balloon hypothesis is described in detail.

4. Due to negative radar contact, possible error in sightings reported as an object traveling luminous surrounded by halo is admitted.

5. Although the planet Jupiter did in the east at this time, it would have been considered for a UFO but dismissed on the basis of its fixed position and lack of motion.

6. Although certain aspects of the lighting corresponded to the 1 lighting described, this object is not considered by the Officer to be a star due to motion and brightness.

James T. Benton
2nd Lt., USAF
Assistant to Chief

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concurs with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by an illuminated weather balloon.

Education: 10 years
Qualifications: Qualified automobile mechanic; Former US Army Air Corps mechanic.

RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a mild mannered man of middle age. He was Air Force radar technician in World War II and has been alert to all unusual activities. Reliability of information based upon experience and the lack of any previous history to the contrary.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE, having retired early on 05/25/56 (saw pants II) the object at 06/01/56 Mar 56. (See parts I)

DURING the sighting which lasted for about 3 minutes, the object appeared to be flying 12 and 15 thousand feet, high, and was moving very fast. It appeared to be a pale green color, slightly larger than a jet plane and was round or circular in shape. The object was very bright and lit up the sky as it traveled. It gave the impression of a small moon or planet. It appeared to be going in a straight line. When first observed the object was approximately 3 miles distant. During entire period of observation, the sky was dark with a few stars and clouds, no moon. The object did at times obstruct SOURCE's vision and particularly at any time when it was in a clear area of the sky. SOURCE heard no sound from object, colors or noises. With binoculars SOURCE observed the object much clearer and with the naked eye SOURCE observed that it was of a pale green color. 

ANALYSIS: I. Statement of SOURCE:
