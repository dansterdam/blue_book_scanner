27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object, and place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This is a further follow up on the information I have written on page 6 part 32.

As the object suddenly shot westwards to my left it seemed to accelerate in a jerk like it was shifting gears before it disappeared. First shifting, it accelerated to a blur, then there was a jerk (as if shifting gears) and then it was gone.

Also, although the object was sharply defined, I had the impression that it was slightly transparent. Also, it would slightly glow in the dark.

It was a sight I will never forget as long as I live. I have never seen anything like it before or since.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]

O was facing North. The object arched downward out of the sky from high over-head at point "A" on the compass. At first it thought it was a comet but it had no tail. It rapidly grew in size from a pin head to about the size of a football kicked high in the air as it grew larger. It seemed to slow down and coast. Then it shot westwards to my left accelerating to about blue and then it was gone all in about 15 seconds.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
Not reported until now

(5) Mr. _______ Pines, Pittsburgh
    He was watching a helicopter and was definitely
    concerned about the object. He is afraid of publicity
    and will lie to keep away from the paper and off
    the radio. He does not want publicity on the matter. He
    said he has decided to keep the matter to himself
    but can be persuaded to report the sighting to the
    matter. He was outside the car when he saw the object.
    He has not reported the sighting to anyone except
    Captain Nessen, and was in his life who are in the
    car. He said he was definitely afraid when he saw
    the object because he had never seen anything that
    resembled it before.

(6) Ground fog had shrouded the valley causing numerous
    activities to pull off to the side of the road.
    Ceiling was estimated to be about 100 feet and the
    visibility was estimated at three-fourths of a mile. Winds

OBSERVER                 1st USN

-1. At 1744N I received the following information by phone from Technical
Sergeant                 who stated that while sitting in his office directly overhead
his neighbors, he saw something that it was not a balloon or a plane. I sent Lieutenant
Falmer of the sighting. I then notified Lieutenant Commander Ubrigtson and tried
to call Captain Dougherty but was unable to contact him. Lieutenant                 then
went out to see if he could identify it. My first impression upon sighting said object was that it was
a weather balloon. I was then at Kirtland AFB at 1755H on 21 July 1952 at Barber Point to
see if I could confirm my opinion. Barber Point had released a weather balloon at about
1500H but it was black in color. I then called Holen Field but they informed me
that they did not have any balloon that day. The information from Kirtland
Airport, I then called the weather bureau at the airport and talked to Mr. Wil who
had released a weather balloon at 1700H made of pure white gas and that he had tracked
it with an azimuth of about 270 degrees. After 21 minutes and then the balloon then
took up a northeasterly direction of about 060 degrees, altitude 46,000 feet. I then
called Lieutenant Falmer and gave him what information I had and told him where he could
contact me. He called me back shortly thereafter and said that he had been able to
identify the object as a balloon. I had an apparent motion except from the wind drift.
I estimated the object to be at an altitude of about 45,000 feet. I then returned to my
office and called Barber Point (Oahu) to see if they could pick up any further information in the general area of where I had seen the object. Their report was negative.

OBSERVER                 1st USN

At about                 was a bright, white, round object at a poor estimated height
of                 degrees relative to the street in front of the Administration
Building. The object appeared to be stationary and in apparent rotation. It is believed
that                 in the bright afternoon resembled a tiny white dot.

Upon observation of light colored object in sky, my impression was that it
was a balloon of some sort due to the fact that it was distant and was slowly rising
higher in the sky. Upon watching for approximately ten minutes the object became
gradually smaller and then slightly disappeared behind clouds and seemed to have
looked to have shrunk to about half the size of original sighting. I therefore,
contend that it was a balloon of some sort, as it was rising nearly straight up.

Submitted in accordance with AF LTR No. 200-5, dated 20 April 1952, Sub: Unidentified
Flying Objects Reporting.

Between the hours 1520 and 1645 MCT, from two (2) to five (5) Unidentified Flying
Objects were observed visually at various sites from surface position at approxi-
mately 1M, 137° N 47°, 30' N, Great Falls Air Force Base, Montana, by Alaskan
Air Force officers, airmen, and civilians.

Objects resembled flat discs reflecting sun's rays and were at an altitude estimated
to be in excess of 30,000 ft. One of the objects hovered from 3 to 4 minutes while
the other three circled an 11 mile calculated. Then the stationary objects moved
southeast to disappear, with the 3 satellites moved due-west and disappeared, all
at speeds estimated in excess of 1,000 mph, apparently returning to vicinity of
first observation then disappeared.

No sounds were emitted or exhaust reflections observed. Weather at time of sightings:
clear, visibility 65 mi., surface wind calm.

STATEMENT OF WITNESSES

S/Sgt.                   1701st Air Traffic Squadron

I, S/Sgt., was coming into the Space Control
office at approximately 1520 MST, 29 July 1952 in the afternoon when I heard a
report over the squawk box saying that flying saucers were sighted in the vicinity
of Seattle headed toward Great Falls. The message that was said was "Flying
saucers reported over the Seattle area headed toward Great Falls" then it was put
off. We then went out of the office and stood in front of Twin Hangars under the tower
and sighted two stationary objects at about 1525 MST. The third one came into the
east and went toward the first two and disappeared in the west in a color of our
seconds. The other two followed and departed to the west and I went back into the
office.

I sighted another one at 1625 MST coming from the northwest and departed
northeast. It appeared that this particular one had a sort of haze around it and
it was only in flight for a few minutes over the mountains. Then there were
at intervals from 1625 to 1640 MST. All that I saw appeared to be a bright white
and shape was circular and one that came over, as it disappeared I thought it was
flat and appeared to be "wing over and spinning around." The ones that were
stationary seemed to be dipping, the sun rays reflecting off and on. They left no
vapor trail and no sound. The angle of the objects was approximately 30 degrees
on the two stationary and first three that came into view at 1525 or also at 30
degrees, the other seemed to go right over head. The angle of observation of last
four was about 80 degrees. I first saw them at 45 degrees and passed overhead
and we lost them at about 1640 MST. Immediately after I lost them I immediately
called the CAA, Gore Field and reported it to them at about 1540. Immediately after
I had sighted the first three objects. He told me to call back and he said he saw
an object and it came from the sun and was like behind another stack. This is one
of the objects that I told him to check. It was followed by people more traveling
the area route as he reported. This one was sighted by me and reported to CAA at
1600. The Toltec called me up at about 1739 MST that night and asked me who I
was and if I saw objects in the sky. I answered "Yes". He asked if we had any
reports previously of these objects and I told him of the message coming from McChord,
"Washington. He took that information which I gave him verbally and printed the story
in the paper.

Then about 2230 MST McChord told me to talk to a Captain and also a Colonel who is the _______ (unreadable). The captain did
the talking and the Colonel listened in, and he asked where I got information and
I told of observation, etc. The Captain seemed to be very much interested in my
report to that effect. What _______ can verify that it came
over the box. He mentioned something about a security leak. I asked him if it
might not just be a regular route of the sun or a star or something.

M/Sgt                                 1701st Air Transport Group

I, M/Sgt, at approximately 1500 IJTS 10 July 1952, was in the Transport Control Center at approximately 1520 IJTS and heard a transmission over the FLAN (13) stating that "flying saucers" were sighted over Cantalo, Washington at approximately 1515 MST and were headed toward Great Falls. They were immediately cut off in the middle of a sentence, as though someone threw a switch. Just for fun I turned that if they were over Cantalo at 1515 MST they should arrive at Great Falls around 1520 MST due to reported speed from various sources in the past of these flying objects. I walked out the front door of the Control Section at 1520 MST and looked into the southeast sky at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees and sighted three (3) objects. One appeared to be larger than the others. The larger object was stationary with the two smaller objects circling the stationary object. Then the first object made an unusual maneuver of small clouds and it was lost from view. The other smaller object darted off the west and was lost back to the larger object. It then disappeared.

Lt.                                   Air Traffic Squadron

I, Lt. at approximately 1500 MST heard over the long horn into the fact that flying saucers were heading toward Great Falls. All in a joking manner I calculated with M/Sgt that at the rate of speed they had been previously determined to go that they would be over Great Falls in one and one-half to two minutes, so several of the people in the locality decided they would go out and look and to my amazement they saw what was flying saucers, and I then went out myself and saw one immediately and two more within the next few minutes. They were extremely similar in shape and silver in color. They had no apparent depth as far as I could determine. One in particular looked as though it stopped, reversed itself in motion and then disappeared at a terrific rate of speed. The other two just disappeared due to my vision being impaired by the bright sun. They appeared to have come from the northwest and the one that I saw was moving southeast.

I, Mrs. was in the office and Mrs. was in there talking to me when I heard M/Sgt call us to listen to the long horn. All I heard of the report was "headed toward Great Falls", and of course, I listened and trying to hear more but could not stand. I remained in the office for a few seconds. I looked the cash drawer and went outside and first saw two objects that appeared about hovering over the tower a little west. They were close probably five minutes and then as near and then over the tower. The objects were silver in color. I first saw those over the tower they were no in a broad white and the light seemed to be a little brighter. When I first saw them they were hovering and then they started to move. It was around 1520 MST when the light appeared. It was around 1520 MST area.

we first went out and I know it was 1600 MST when watching the last time.

One of the objects above tower took off to my left at immense rate of speed and left a white streak in the sky, probably was the object's great speed.

People in the office were T.                 S/Sgt.                 and myself.

Capt.                                 1701st Air Traffic Squadron

A little background of this incident will clarify the statements that I, Captain                     have to make. The question was asked by myself to the                     "How did they know to go outside and look up there to the southeast?" The statement was that they had heard a transmission over the squawk box that flying saucers had been reported, but they were headed toward Great Falls. I asked how the transmission came from and she did not know as it came through the squawk box.

At 1525 MST I was outside the hangar looking in the direction of 50 degrees true north at the angle of approximately 35 degrees and I saw two (2) objects stationary, these apparently were what people think were flying saucers. The altitude which these objects were cannot be estimated due to the fact of not knowing size or conception of these objects I was unable to determine the altitude.

The appearance of these objects did actually have the size of a cup's saucer and appeared to have a flat diameter base. At times they would have a discolored color and they would seem to drift to an angle. Then the prediction of the run on them it appeared that they had a shiny aluminum color. These two objects were stationary when I first saw them, for approximately 3 or 4 minutes. Suddenly one can in at approximately 45 degrees angle toward the two stationary objects. It appeared to be of a dusty color without any shiny appearance to it. This object continued to travel past these objects and off into a southerly direction. By this time the objects the right, the altitude, I was facing toward the east - started with a backward motion which appeared to be with tremendous speed. The one to my left darted off to the south and all three were lost from sight.

During the time I was watching these objects I requested S/Sgt                     to come over Great Falls and see if they were aware of their presence and to see if they could pick up any information, thinking possible that they had some radar equipment that might give us some additional intelligence information that the United States Government would be interested in.

As soon as the objects had disappeared I came into the Traffic Office and called the Wing Intelligence, asked for Wing Intelligence Officer and was informed there was an outfit named S/Sgt Fernandez. At this time S/Sgt Fernandez was gone and I was informed to put questioning on these particular objects.

Major [redacted]                              170lst Air Transport Group

I, Major [redacted], at approximately 1545 MST, 29 July witnessed a circular object traversing the stratosphere, at approximately 30,000 to 40,000 feet high. The objects were silver or white in color and definitely disc shape in structure. They moved with extreme maneuverability. They appeared to travel from west to east and west to southeast at approximately 2,000 miles per hour. There was no vapor trails visible. One layer disc shaped, beveled and pulsating glass seemed to be admitted from its periphery. It hovered for about 20 seconds and immediately darted off at a high rate of acceleration and disappeared to the southeast. I have heretofore been very truthful as to my flying saucers or anything of that nature but I will swear that these were definite objects.

At one time I saw one in a bank and saw a metallic flash. On this particular date, 29 July, the sky was cloudless, except for a few strata-cumulus formed clouds and the ground visibility was approximately 65 miles. The atmosphere was very very clear. In other words, the sky above was a blue ice crystal atmosphere. I am sure of the direction of these being from the west and to the east and southeast. I saw approximately 5 of these objects.

1st Lt [redacted]                             170lst Air Transport Group

I, 1st Lt [redacted] upon reporting for duty 1530 MST saw 15 to 20 people watching the sky. Was told that they had seen flying saucers. I was very skeptical at the time. Because of the large number of dandelion seeds in the air and also what appeared to be newspaper carried aloft by the wind. The newspapers were in the general vicinity of RTD operations. None were observed in the general area.

Often watching approximately five (5) minutes I was able to see what appeared to be a disc. (Noted in close) As it moved slightly overhead it turned generally north at a 90 degree turn then slowing down approximately four (4) more 90 degrees and then proceeded east.

Seeing these five (5) more of these objects. Being skeptical I did my best to see them as either down or up. When I first started to look I could see nothing on the surface or in the earth rather than large objects at some distance. However, after keeping them in my sight lost might a while their appearance they definitely seemed to be very high. I might even mention one of the height of the objects I saw in the west and proceeded east at what appeared to be an extreme high rate of speed.

Due to the 90 degree turns and the apparent high rate of speed I discount any possibility of them being conventional or jet type aircraft. I am unable to give any definite description as to their shape other than they appeared to be completely round.

AF FORM 112—PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Some header information is partially illegible]

Late in the afternoon on 29 July 1952, [redacted] and an employee of [redacted] were standing in front of his house waiting and saw friends of [redacted] drive up.

At approximately 1844 PDT they heard a noise which sounded like a jet engine passing over/and. They both looked up to see it. After scanning the sky from Northwest to Southeast, at first glance they both thought it was a buzzard. However, they immediately changed their minds for this object was perfectly round.

[Most of the subsequent text describes an unidentified flying object sighting, with some portions redacted or partially illegible]

Key details include:
- Object was round
- Estimated to be slightly larger than a lead pencil viewed end-wise
- Object changed direction and moved in unusual ways
- Witnesses included multiple people
- Occurred in California
- Object appeared to move about 10 miles
- Witnesses were initially unsure what they saw

The document appears to be an official Air Force UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book, dated 29 July 1952.

Major _____________, 170lst Air Transport Wing

I, Major _____________, was requested by T/Sgt _____________ at approximately 1600 MST to look at an object in the air. Looking in a northeasterly direction, altitude unknown, I sighted an object round and white in appearance. Its movements were like a falling leaf for several seconds and then it proceeded in an east-southeasterly heading, speed unknown.

Captain _____________, 170lst Air Transport Wing

I, Captain _____________, at approximately 1645 MST on 29 July, after returning from flying in local area, right in front of Twin Hangars noticed several people looking upward. They stated that by some accounts, after about half a dozen allegedly passed by, I could not see them. The only thing visible to me was American seeds flying through the air.

T/Sgt _____________, 170lst Air Traffic Squadron

I, C/Sgt _____________, at approximately 1450 MST was returning to my section when I noticed a group of people in front of Twin Hangars looking up into the sky and one man pointed up and I saw objects that seemed to be silver and similar to a weather balloon only slightly. I observed one at a 45 degree angle looking toward the south and right below it a smaller object moving back and forth like a pendulum and it seemed that one side or lower object was black and it turned one way and then disappeared and turned back and it came into view again, indicating only one side was reflecting the sun. The object seemed to move in a straight line and stop and turn around and move back and at the end of movement it would lose itself for a few seconds and start back. Off to the right (southwest at about a 45 degree angle) a similar object appeared and moved across the horizon southeast at a terrific rate of speed and passed close to the other two objects. After the third disappeared in the southeast, the other two objects were invisible to me and without further observation I returned to work.

A/2C _____________, 170lst Air Traffic Squadron

I, A/2C _____________, at approximately 1430 MST saw white objects coming out of the west going east. They looked to be approximately 10,000 or 25,000 feet high. They left no vapor trail or smoke. As to speed, they appeared to move very slowly, or _____________ saw several of them.

1/3e                     1701st Air Transport Wing

I, [redacted]/3c, [redacted] at approximately 1605 MST stepped out of the Traffic Section right in front of the hangar and immediately noticed people looking up into the sky. When they saw me they said an object was in the sky. When I first looked up I noticed an object like a plate at approximately an high of 80 degrees altitude. I noticed it was going around like a piece of paper, but it was following a pattern. The height and glare made it hard to determine exactly the height, but I would say it was very high and at a tremendous speed. Pattern was in a swirling or diping motion. It the right of this first object, I saw a second object. It was going in a northeasterly direction. It was at approximately the same height, and from my own observations it seemed to be going at a terrific speed. It has the same identical pattern as the first one. I was like 1/2 to 3/4 mile from the objects. The second object was more easily to follow because of a pattern which was straight.

I, [redacted]/3c, [redacted] at approximately 1605 MST, 29 July was standing out in front of the hangar and saw everyone else looking up into the sky, and I saw three (3) objects which I would say were 20,000 feet in the air and when I first saw them they looked like they were going around and around and gave off a white glare and every once in a while they would swoop down. In my opinion of what I saw they were birds as it seemed that one flipped its wings. In to an 1/2 way I looked to be about the size of a sheet of paper. I observed these at about an 30 degree angle.

I, Mrs. [redacted] was in our office around 1530 when one of the boys came in and asked if I had been the flying saucers and I told him that he was just kidding. I did not believe what he was telling me, so I just stayed in the office. About one-half hour to forty-five minutes later, Mrs. [redacted] from the central area came in and asked if I had seen the flying saucers. I told her that I had heard about them but did not go out to look as I thought they were just kidding. She said that as she was looking out the window of the passenger terminal and started looking up into the sky. At first I could not see anything and then everyone kept pointing and said there they are and I kept looking and then saw what looked like three objects at this time. After that I went back to my office.

STATEMENT                                                  1701st Air Traffic Sq

I, [redacted], was coming into the Space Control office at approximately 1520 MST, 29 July 1952 in the afternoon when I heard a report over the squawk box saying that flying saucers were sighted in the vicinity of Seattle, headed toward Great Falls.

The message that was said was "Flying saucers reported over the Seattle area" headed toward Great Falls" then it was cut off. 4/5's went out of the office and stood in front of Twin Hangars under the tower and sighted two stationary objects at about 1525 MST. The third one came from the west and appeared to depart to the west in a matter of four seconds. The other two followed and departed to the west and I went back into the office.

I sighted another one at 1625 MST coming from the northwest and departed northwest. It appeared that this particular one had a sort of haze around it and it was only in sight for about three or four seconds. Then three more came over at intervals from 1625 to 1640 MST. All that I saw appeared to be a bright white and shape was circular and one that came over, as in display, seemed to be turning over and spinning around. The ones that were stationary seemed to be dipping, the sun rays reflecting off and on. They left no vapor trail and no sound. The angle of the objects was approximately 90 degrees on the two stationary and the first three that came through at 1625 MST also at 50 degrees, the other seemed to go right over head. The angle of observation at 1625 MST was about 45 degrees and they passed overhead and we lost them at about 45 degree angle in a lapse of time of 4 seconds. I called the CAA, Gen. Field and reported it to them at 1540, 1550, 1600 after I had signed the first three objects. He told me to call back and he said he saw an object and it came from the sun and was lost behind another stack. This is one of the objects that I told him to track. It was followed by people here traveling the same route as he reported. This one was sighted by me and reported to CAA at 1600. The Tribune called me up at about 1735 MST that night and asked as to I saw objects in the sky. I answered "Yes." He asked if we had any reports previously of these objects in the area. I told him of the message coming from McChord, Washington. He took that information which I gave him myself and printed the story in the paper.

Then about 2220 MST McChord Field called me long distance and I talked to a regular air traffic controller. He said he understood I had sighted flying objects. I said "Yes." He asked if I got information and I told of overhearing from a work box from McChord. He said transmitting any report to base offices. 4/5's and 1st Lt. [redacted] was on duty. He mentioned something about a security lack. I asked his if I would go into detail over this and he said he hardly thought so.

STATEMENT, S/Sgt [redacted], Jr., 1702nd Air Traffic Squadron

Then at approximately 2345 MST the Associated Press' representative in town called me on the phone and asked me where I received information and report of objects over Seattle. He said the AP had gotten in touch with his from Seattle and said they had no report of objects over area in Washington, State. I then told the AP representative that I merely had overheard the conversation.

I, M/Sgt was in the Transport Control Center at approximately 1520 MST 29 July 1952, and heard a transmission over the PLAN 115, stating that "flying, weasers" were sighted over Sachia, Washington at approximately 1515 MST and were headed toward Great Falls. They were immediately out off in the middle of a sequence, as though some one threw a switch. Just for fun I cleared the Control Section at Great Falls around 1520 MST due to reported speed from various sources in the past of these flying objects. I walked out the Front Door of the Control Section at 1520 MST and looked into the south quadrant of the sky at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees and sighted three (3) objects. One appeared to be larger than the others. The larger object was stationary, with the smaller objects circling around it counter-clockwise. Then the first object reached the western side of the stationary object it immediately darted off to the southeast, behind a group of small clouds and 11 was lost from view. The other smaller object darted off due west and when I looked back at the larger object it had disappeared.

Lt. [redacted] USAF [redacted]                                     Air Traffic Squadron

I, Lt. [redacted] at approximately 1500 MST heard over the long home the fact that flying somethings were heading toward Great Falls. All in a joking manner I calculated with Wg's [redacted] that at the rate of speed such things would presumably continue to go that they would go over Great Falls in two or three minutes. So several of the people in the locality decided they would go out and look and to my surprise they were said flying maneuver, and I then went out myself and saw the same thing within the next few minutes. They were circular in shape and silver in color. They had no apparent depth as far as I could determine. One in particular looked as though 18 degrees, moved at itself in azimuth and then disappeared at a terrific rate of speed. The other two just disappeared due to my vision being impaired by the bright sun. They appeared to have come from the northwest and the one that I saw was moving southeast.

I, Mrs. [redacted] was in the office and Mrs. [redacted] was in there talking to me when I heard a/c. It was to listen to the loud hum. All I heard of the report was "healed town Crest Falls", and of course, I listened trying to hear some more but made yeah [unclear word] somewhat. I remember coming out and went outside and first saw two objects that appeared round hovering over the tower a little west. They were probably 15 to 20 feet in diameter. The following were actually outside and I saw back out to look again and at an angle of 45 degrees first these over the tower they were an intense white and the light seemed to illuminate, by that I mean that first these were a bright light which at two span would probably appear again in the same spot. On the first two there seemed to me to be a silvery gray fog around them when the light appeared. It was around 1900 MST when I first went out and I was at 1600 MST when watching the last time.

One of the objects above tower took off to my left at intense rate of speed and left a white streak in the sky, probably was the objects great speed.

People in the office were Lt. [redacted]/Sgt. [redacted], Mrs. [redacted] and myself.

170lst Air Traffic Sq

A little background of this incident will clarify the statements that I. Again I have to make. The question was asked by several persons. "Then did they know to go outside and look for these flying saucers?" The statement she (name blacked out) made was that they had heard a transmission over the squawk box that flying saucers had been reported and that they were headed toward Oroat Field. I asked her where the transmission came from and she did not know as it came through the squawk box.

At 1625 MST I was outside the hangar looking in the direction of 50 degrees true north at the angle of approximately 25 degrees and I saw two (2) object stationary. These apparently were what people thought were flying saucers. The altitude which these objects were cannot be estimated due to the fact of not knowing size or conception of these objects I was unable to determine the altitude.

The appearance of the objects did actually have the size of a cup's saucer and appeared to have a flat aluminum base. At times they would have a discolored color and they would seem to drift to an angle. With the proficiency of the eye as these two appeared that they had a sickly aluminum color. These two objects were stationary when I first saw them, for approximately 5 or 6 minutes. Suddenly one came in at about a 45 degree angle. Possibly the best description of it, a dusty color without any shiny appearance to it. This object continued to travel past these objects and off into a southerly direction. By this time the objects were the right, the direction in which I was facing. I was looking toward the west, sighted with tremendous speed. The one on my left darted off to the south and all three were lost from sight at this time.

During the time I was watching these objects I requested S/Sgt [name blacked out] to come out and look and inform me if they had some objects in the sky. At first they were unable to see the objects and then if they would pick up any information, thinking possible that they had some early originals that might assist in picking up any additional information in the United States Government would be interested in.

As soon as the objects had disappeared I came into the traffic office and called the Wing Intelligence, asked for Wing Intelligence Officer and was informed there was an NCOIC named T/Sgt Fernandez. At this time T/Sgt Fernandez was gone and I was informed he was out checking on these reported objects.

STATEMENT

1701st Air Transport Group

I, Major [redacted], at approximately 1845 MST, 29 July observed a circular object traversing the stratosphere, at approximately 50,000 to 60,000 feet high. The objects were silver or white in color and definitely circular. They were maneuverable. They appeared to travel from west to east and west to southeast at approximately 2,000 to 3,000 miles per hour.

There was no vapor trail visible. One larger than possible object hovered and I pinning clear points noted from its periphery. It hovered for about 30 seconds and immediately darted off at a high rate of acceleration and disappeared to the southwest. I have heretofore been very definite as to my flying experience or nature but I will swear that these were definite objects.

At one time I saw one in a bank and saw a metallic flash. On this particular date, 29 July, the sky was cloudless, except for a few strata-nimbus formed clouds and the ground visibility was approximately 40 miles. The atmosphere was very very clear. In other words, the sky above me to the horizon was good contrast. I am sure of the direction of these being from the west and to the east and southeast. I saw approximately 5 of these objects.

1701st Air Transport Gp

Lst Lt G

I, 1st Lt G, upon reporting for duty 1530 hrs 15 or 20 people watching the sky. Was told that they had seen flying objects. I was very skeptical at this point because of the large number of dandelion seeds in the air and also what appeared to be newspaper carried aloft by the wind. The newspapers were in the general vicinity of KRTV quarters. Here were observed in the direction that the so-called saucers were spotted.

After watching approximately five (5) minutes I was able to see what appeared to be a disc, white or metal in color approaching from the west. As it moved directly overhead it turned generally north at a 30 degree turn then slowing down and made approximately four (4) more 90 degree turns then proceeded east.

After seeing this I knew what I was looking for and was able to pick up 1 beam (15) more of their color objects. Being skeptical I did my best to see them as either dandelion seeds or other small particles close to the surface of the earth rather than large objects at extreme distances. However, after keeping them in my sight long enough to study their appearance, they definitely were not dandelion seeds. I was able to make an estimate of the height since I did not know their size. All of these appeared in the west and proceeded east at what appeared to be an extra high rate of speed.

Due to the 30 degree turns and the apparent high rate of speed I am unable to give any definite description of type of aircraft. I am unable to give any definite description as to their shape other than that they appeared to be completely round.

I, S/Sgt was returning to my section when I noticed a group of people in Front of Twin Hangar looking up into the sky and some one pointed up and I saw objects that seemed to be silver and similar to a weather balloon only antique. I observed one at a 45 degree angle looking toward the south and right. Below at a caller object moving back and forth like a pendulum and it seemed that one side or lower object was black and it turned one way and then disappeared and turned back and it would come into view again. Indicating the sun was reflecting, the one object seemed to move in a straight line and stop and turn around and move back and at end of movement it would lose itself for a few seconds and partly make off (?) to the right (northwest) at a point 45 degree angle) a similar object appeared and moved across the horizon southeast at a terrible rate of speed and passed close to the other two objects. After the third disappeared in the southeast the other two objects were invisible to me and further observation I returned to work.

I, A/3c at approximately 1605 MST, 
29 July was standing out in front of the hangar and saw everyone else 
looking up into the sky, and I saw three (3) objects which I would say 
were 20,000 feet in the air and when I first saw them they looked like 
they were going around and around and gave off a white, glare and every 
time in a while they would come. In my opinion of what I saw, 
they were birds as it seemed that one flipped its wings. As to size 
they looked to be about the size of a sheet of paper. I observed these 
at about an 80 degree angle.

I, A/So, at approximately 1600 MST stopped out the traffic section right at front of the hangar and immediately noticed people looking up into the sky. I found out that they were looking at small objects in the sky. Then I first looked up I noticed an object like a plate of approximately 80 degrees altitude. I noticed it was going ground like a piece of paper, but it was following a pattern. The height and glare made it hard to determine exactly the height, but I would say it was very high at a tremendous speed. Following the same pattern, I saw a second object. At the right of this first object I saw a second object, it was going in a straight south direction and then 90° southeast direction. It was an apparently very fast object, and from my observation it seemed to be going at a terrific speed. It has the same identical form as the first one, i.e., it was like a plate and was reflecting off the area. The second object was more easily to follow because of a pattern which was straight.

I, Mrs. [redacted] was in one office around 1530 when one of the boys came in and asked if I had seen the flying saucers and I told him that he was just kidding. I did not believe what he was telling me, so I just stayed in the office. About one-half hour to forty-five minutes later, Mrs. [redacted] came in and asked if I had seen the flying saucers. I told her that I had heard about this but did not go out to look as I thought they were just kidding. She said that she had gone then to the passenger terminal and started looking up into the sky. At first I could not see anything and then everyone kept pointing and said there and I kept looking and then I did see a white object and it would sort of no army red then reappear just as if it was moving itself. I saw the objects at this time, after that I went back to my office.

At approximately 1600 [redacted] came in and we went out to look and this time I noticed they were adjacent to the tower and it was the same white shiny objects. One could not watch constantly because of the heat. I could not see which way they were going or the speed of their movement because I could not keep watching as my eyes would get blurry.

I, Mrs. [redacted], was at home eight miles from the Great Falls AFB when my husband, who was on duty at the base, called me to look for some objects in the air which had been sighted at the base.

I saw an object in the western sky traveling west to west about 1630 hrs and after sighting it I got my binoculars. The shape was definitely not a wing or tail or other protrusion. On the back of it was red in color. A thirteen year old boy was with me and he could substantiate as to the color. I saw two others after this.

The last two were traveling north to south in the western part of the sky. There seemed to be a vapor around them and behind them. Due to the brightness of the sun I was unable to get these two in the glasses. All three seemed to disappear, just seemed to travel out of sight.

Flying Objects Reporting.

As a result of publicity given reported Unidentified Flying Objects in the vicinity
of Great Falls, Montana on 29 July 1952, Mrs. [redacted] North, Great Falls, Montana came forward and reported the following:

At 0600 hrs, MST on 5 November 1950, she and her husband were traveling in a car on
Highway No. 87 between Great Falls and Raymond, Montana at which time they
observed an unidentified flying object moving from east to west passing within
approximately 100 feet of their car.

The object was disc-like and appeared to be about the size and shape of an automobile
tire when looking at it broadside, and judged it to be approximately eight inches
thick. When approaching to be approximately 15 ft. away, the complete
forward side of the object consisted wholly of a strong, white light, while from the
rear of the object there were emitted blue-white sparks extending for a distance of
approximately three-tenths of a mile. That she noted no sound from the object, not
appearing to be moving as the windows of the car were closed at the time.

A sketch of the object is attached.

No estimation was given as to speed the object was traveling, or as to weather
conditions prevailing at the time.

SUBJECT: Recapitulation of Facts Concerning Unidentified Objects Sighted in the Great Falls, Montana Area on 20 July 1952

1. Tuesday, 20 July 1952, at approximately 1540 hours MST four (4) unidentified objects were sighted over Great Falls AFB. Objects resembled light (hazy) reflecting sun's rays. Positioned south from Great Falls AFB (Incl. 1). One (1) object was stationary and three (3) were seen circling around it. They were seen for three (3) to four (4) minutes, then the stationary object flew somewhat erratically and disappeared. No sound was emitted or exhaust was observed. Speed of the objects was estimated at over one thousand (1000) miles per hour. Altitude was not determined due to lack that the objects were definitely to be above 30,000 feet. All objects were visual from the ground. They were seen by an estimated fifty persons including officers, airmen and civilians (statement attached as Incl. 2). On 20 July 1952 near the city of Great Falls, Montana (statement attached as Incl. 2).

2. First notification of flying objects was heard from the Seattle, Washington area (presumably McChord AFB) over the Plan 62 Voice Circuit of the Lowry Control Center, this Base. The transmission was cut off, approximately after the network reporting flying objects. Individuals, 8/Sgt [redacted] with 17th Air Traffic Squadron, this Base, sighted objects immediately after this Plan 62 transmission and sighted local news. One Field, Great Falls, Montana, who in turn contacted the Great Falls Tribune contacted 8/Sgt [redacted] who substantially gave the reporter information regarding unidentified flying objects and Plan 62 transmission. A reporter from the Great Falls Tribune was heard. At approximately 2200 hours MST 8/Sgt [redacted] received a call from an individual who identified himself as [redacted], [redacted] AFB, who denied any knowledge or acceptance of any statement regarding "flying saucers". 8/Sgt [redacted] was in error or releasing this story, in that he had not received or had he contacted the Base Commander, Base Information Officer or Base Intelligence Officer.

3. At 1200 hours MST Thursday, 31 July 1952, the local radio station KGCX broadcast an interview with a Mr. [redacted] resident of Great Falls, who claimed he saw unidentified flying objects. He contacted the manager of the radio station KGCX, who informed us that the unidentified film over to the Commanding Officer.

STATEMENT OF WITNESS

I, [redacted], on the 29 July was returning with my family from a fishing trip in Idaho, and had heard a radio or read a newspaper in the days we had been gone. About eight (8) miles south of Radio, Montana, traveling from West Yellowstone to Ennis between 1400 and 1500 hours MST: I noticed a dark colored objecthovering over the mountains to the right of the highway. I slowed down and stopped the car, and as I did so the object formed a white cloud around itself. The distance was, as I would estimate it three or four miles in a direct line and the clouds were about one thousand feet above the ground. Fairly small. I saw these similar disc like objects came bursting out of the clouds from different angles traveling at an estimated hundreds of miles per hour. Each of these objects made an arc in different directions and at the peak of the arc accelerated at a terrific speed and departed to a central point behind the clouds and disappeared. There was a trail of very hazy film of dark colored smoke. I had an eight-power binocular when I was watching this.

I stopped two other cars, one from Arkansas and one from Ohio. The man in the car from Ohio, a part of 50-group bombardiers, to all, and I think there was about a dozen of us, watched with the naked eye and binoculars. Shortly after the three objects left the cloud five other objects appeared on the right side of the cloud in a V formation, then slowly and then each of those in succession formed a small cloud around themselves. They changed formation from the V to single file and entered the big cloud one behind the other.

During this time I took colored moving pictures with a Gem Bell and Howell camera and 16MM Revere, black and white, with a Kodak Retina camera. We watched these several minutes, and the objects were moving in the sky in our range of vision. Upon the advice of a senior officer, who was an Air Force officer, we were turned over to Major [redacted] of the [redacted] Air Force Base, Montana.

Along about thirty minutes on a mountain to the left of the highway, and some 15 miles distant, another apparently spontaneous phenomenon took place with objects leaving and returning.

I wish to add that I am a Major in the Army Corps of [redacted] and had a "C" Clearance 1946 to 1948 while stationed with Z Division, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Between the hours of 1400 and 1500 MST, 29 July 1952, from four (4) to nine (9)
unidentified flying objects were reported observed visually with naked eye and high-
powered binoculars from surface position approximately 110° W. - 45°, 15' N., some 8 miles south of Havre, Montana (8) by a Major, _____ and other unidentified persons.

When first observed there was one indefinitely shaped object, non-transparent, dark
color hovering about 1000-ft above a mountain some 3 to 4 miles distant from observer.
The object then appeared to hide itself in a self-created white cloud. Shortly after
three (3) smaller disc-like objects burst out of the cloud from different angles,
traveling at estimate 200 MPH, each making an arc in different directions, at peaks
of area they accelerated to terrific speed and returned to central point behind cloud.
After the three smaller objects burst from the cloud to form the area, five other
objects approached. From the right is a V formation traveling slowly, then each of
these, in succession, moved into a loose around the area, changed from the V to
single file and curved the big cloud. (Attached is diagram of these maneuvers).
Some 30 minutes later, the group again slowly appeared over a mountain some six miles
from first place.

of the 29th Air Division Defense, attached this station. Mr. was thereupon contacted and he stated that between 1400 and 1500 hours, 23 July 1952, he sighted unidentified flying objects about eight (8) miles south of Great Falls, Montana. Mr. took still and moving pictures of the objects in both color and black and white film. On the advice of a civilian firm and to hold the Government's files, the 29th Air Division, who checked the Intelligence Officer, 29th Air Division, Major turned the undeveloped film over to Major who dispatched the film to headquarters.

Colonel Paul Trainer, Commander 17th Air Division, California and Major McCarthy, Intelligence Officer, 29th Air Division, were informed that in accordance with AF Letter 200-5, the local Intelligence Detachment, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, should have been notified immediately for shipping instructions and that this headquarters should have been notified of the mission taking place. Colonel Gruber stated that he had informed Headquarters MATS requesting that they contact ATIC for shipping instructions and that all matters of this nature would be coordinated with the 17th Air Transport Wing Intelligence Office. In his statement and drawing (Incl. 3 & 4), and he further stated that he would appreciate having his film back when the Air Force is through with it.

4. At the time of the sighting aircraft flying in the local area consisted of two(2) C-47, eight (8) C-46 and one (1) B-25.

5. Weather at the time of the sighting was clear with visibility of sixty-five (65) miles and winds were calm. (Incl. 5)

6. The Intelligence Officer of the 29th Air Division Defense, attached this station, was contacted and stated that the unidentified flying objects were near the 29th Air Defense Radar Scope. The time of the sighting was sometime in July 1945, AGC stated that the sighting of these objects were made with the CPS radar group.

7. Additional information regarding unidentified flying objects was obtained during this investigation. A sighting on 5 Nov 1952 at 0500 hours on 5 January 1950, near Great Falls-Montana, were traveling east on Highway No. 87 between Great Falls and Lewistown, Montana, at this time they observed an object moving east to west that was mobile. This object was six (6) to eight (8) miles from their car, mobile. This object was the size with a strong white light in front and emitting blue-white sparks to the rear (drawing attached). More observations were made of an automobile this time the object seemed to be about the size and shape of an automobile tire broadside and was pulling through the air. The complete front side consisted practically of white lights. The body, which appeared to be solidifying, was jagged to an approximately eight foot diameter. The object was observed for approximately 12 to 15 seconds.

STATEMENT

Great Falls, Montana

I, [redacted], on the 29 July was returning with my family from a fishing trip in Idaho, we had not heard a radio or read a newspaper in the days we had been gone. About eight (8) miles south of Dillon, Montana, traveling from West Yellowstone to Bunis between 1400 and 1500 hours MST I settled a dark colored object hovering over the mountains to the right of the highway. I slowed down and stopped the car, and as I did so the object formed a white cloud around itself. The distance was, as I would estimate it three or four miles in a direct line and the clouds were about one thousand feet above the summit of the mountain. Shortly after that three similar like objects came bursting out of the clouds from different angles traveling at an estimated two hundred miles per hour. Each of these objects made an arc to different altitudes and at the peak of the arc accelerated at a terrific speed and departed to a central point behind the clouds and disappeared. There was a trail of very tiny file of dark colored smoke.

I had an eight-power binocular when I was watching this.

I stopped two other cars, one from Arkansas and one from Ohio. The man in the car from Ohio had a pair of 50-power binoculars. No oil, and I think there was about a dozen of us, watched with the naked eye and binoculars. Shortly after the three objects left the cloud five objects appeared on the right side of the cloud in a V formation traveling slightly and then each of these five made a small cloud around themselves. They changed formation from the V to single file and entered the big cloud one behind the other.

During this time I took colored moving pictures with an 8 mm Bell & Howell movie and still pictures, black and white, with a Kodak Retina camera. This was the first time this area was watching for at least thirty minutes one at this site. We were watching the no other clouds formed in the sky in our range of vision. Upon the advice of a civilian friend in film, Hollywood, were turned over to Major [redacted] of the 20th Air Middle, at Gowen Field, Boise, Idaho.

Along about the end of the thirty minutes on a mountain to the left of the highway and some six miles oriented from us another cloud suddenly appeared and then phenomena took place with objects leaving and returning.

I wish to add that I am a Major in the [redacted] and had a "Q" Clearance 1946 to 1948 while stationed with 7 Division, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

2. The following report by [redacted] Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, University of California, Los Alamos, New Mexico:

"About 1000 hours (IST) on 29 July 1952 at Jemez Site, Los Alamos Canyon, Los Alamos, New Mexico, I observed an object, white in color, that appeared to be changing perspective or going through gyrations. It had a fluttering appearance. I observed the object for a few seconds and then stopped looking at it. In the view of the canyon there was a few small scattered clouds and the wind velocity was low. Five minutes later, jets appeared from Kirkland Air Force base."

3. Lt [redacted] stated that [redacted] is a very reliable person and had experience on radar research during World War II.

4. The following reported by [redacted] Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, University of California, Los Alamos, New Mexico:

"About 1020 hours (IST) on 29 July 1952 at Los Alamos Canyon, Los Alamos, New Mexico, I observed a oblong to round object, bright white in color with film trailing. In intensity, in the sky over Los Alamos. The object was flying a straight trajectory, apparently from east to west. I observed the object for ten (10) seconds before it disappeared behind the rim of the canyon. The light intensity was changing in intensity at a rather slow repetitive rate. The sky was clear with a few clouds on the horizon. Two jets appeared later."

5. Lt [redacted] stated that [redacted] is a nuclear scientific employee for the University of California and a very reliable person.

6. The following reported by [redacted] Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, University of California, Los Alamos, New Mexico:

"Approximately 1000 hours (IST) on 29 July 1952 at Los Alamos Canyon, Los Alamos, New Mexico, I observed an undiscernible object, white in color, appearing larger than a jet at 300, 200 feet. As the object was moving in a straight line flight with an approximate speed of 1.5 degrees per second. The brilliance of the object underwent changes as though light metal, varying with exposure of wings or terrain, or motion. I viewed the object for approximately 20 seconds before the canyon wall obstructed my view. The object did leave a vapor trail. Weather conditions were clear and an unusual wind in the canyon wall present."

SWORN STATEMENT

I, [redacted] pilot employed by [redacted] Air Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On July 29, 1952, at approximately 1045 A.M., a group of five persons stepped out of the Control Tower at Los Alamos. We were talking about, "Flying Saucers". At the time and looking up at the sky and sighted an object which appeared to have no wings or tail surface and was travelling at a very high rate of speed in a southwesterly direction.

I, personally, observed the object for approximately four or five seconds, and was unable to pick the object up again upon looking back. I would judge that it was at least 20,000 feet and moving at least 500 to 600 MPH southwest.

The sky was clear and the wind on the ground was North at five to 10 MPH. The object was clearly visible and appeared to be round in shape.

FIRST STATEMENT

I, [redacted], employed by the Atomic Energy Commission, Los Alamos, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On July 29th, I was north and west of the airport (approximately a mile or a mile and a half.) I had seen this thin for probably 30 seconds. I had been watching these jets with my little ten year old boy at my residence, and we were pointing them out and two jets raised generally went to east leaving vapor trails. I just stepped in the door when my son said he saw three of them so I stepped back out and looked and I saw a shiny object just under the vapor trails traveling in the same direction as the vapor trails and leaving no trail. It seemed to be circular. In shape, too fast to be a plane. Closer and the jets did not left the trails. It possibly could have been one of the jets but it looked double around and not quite an elliptical below, but it was circular. It is possible that it was a jet that swung around and came back.

I couldn't tell the shape. It was just an object and was shiny and looked about the same size as the jets.

[UNCLASSIFIED header]

I, [redacted], Los Alamos, New Mexico, so employed by the Atomic Energy Commission, do hereby make the following statement:

On July 29 at approximately 10 a.m., MST, I was down in the canyon. I didn't definitely make out any exact shape, but I saw a spot looking across, and there were 10 University personnel and 2 or 3 being in the tower, and we all saw the same thing. I called in to headquarters and told them that this was going across the canyon.

But over it was not too visible was it was definitely something but I don't know what. I was not too hot. Okay, I couldn't estimate the speed. I did not watch too long as I went in and called Communications to go see jets or do it. The jets and the object were in view at the same time. The approximate direction was definitely west. I would say that this was under the object. I have no idea how far below because it seemed to be in the-there was a light haze of clouds across. The jets were over 500 feet. The object was just moving straight west.

In comparison to the size of the jet it was approximately the same size. There were no very trails, just a spot moving across. The object wasn't moving too fast. The jets were going fairly fast.

We couldn't see the jets coming back here. The boys told me outside that the jet was just passing over the object and that was relayed to Kirtland. However, you could just see the jets and they seemed to be way below the clouds.

In relationship to the airport, our position was approximately one and one-half miles to the southwest.

SWORN STATEMENT

I, [redacted], pilot for [redacted] Air Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On the 29th of July, at approximately 1045 MST, in company with Lt. [redacted] and the Tower Operator on duty at the Los Alamos Airport, I sighted an object in the air over Los Alamos. At first sight, the object was seen at about a fifteen degree angle from the vertical, traveling in a southwesterly direction.

To compare it in size and speed with something known, it would appear about the size of an F-86 at about 40,000 feet traveling at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour. The sky was clear and the object appeared whitish in color. I observed it for 3 or 4 seconds with the naked eye. Then, I tried to pick it up with binoculars, but I lost it and was unable to pick it up again.

SHORT STATEMENT

I, [redacted], Atomic Energy Commission, Los Alamos, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

The time that I saw this object was approximately 1050 hours EDT on the 29th of July. I was at the airstrip tower at this time.

The length of time I observed the object was very short—part a couple of seconds. I haven't had any previous experience as an observer but I was with [redacted] at this time. The object was moving across the sky in a northerly direction. Slowly drifting in W.N. direction to the north. Soon that it slanted with a slight distance. This object was across the mountain, it was moving more from east to west. Possibly just a little south to west.

I saw it just for a few seconds. It was a distant speck in the sky.

The sun that I was with was using Field Glasses and at that time the object made a slight turn. It was not like the other clouds that was blowing the clouds in the opposite direction. He followed the object which disappeared the cloud which was to the west over the mountain range behind Los Alamos. It was the only noticeable cloud in that vicinity.

As far as I could tell, this object had no vapor trail to the naked eye. As I saw it, it was a silvery speck in the sky.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation requested by the District Commander, predicated upon information furnished by U.S. Atomic Energy Security Service, Los Alamos, New Mexico, concerning the observation of an unidentified aerial object.

2. The following was reported by [redacted] at Los Alamos, New Mexico:

"Approximately 1100 hours (JST), 29 July 1952, I sighted an object in the sky travelling in a westerly direction. The object when first sighted was about 700 above the horizon. The distance of the object could not be determined. The object appeared egg-shaped and dark in color, possibly dark brown or black. The object continued straight West at a speed faster than a jet and disappeared in three (3) seconds from the time sighted behind Bald Mountain. The size of the object could not be determined because of the distance. The object left no vapor trail or color. It flew a straight and level and made no sounds. I was looking for aircraft when the object was sighted."

3. The following was reported by [redacted] telephone installer, at Los Alamos, New Mexico:

"At 1057 hours (JST), 29 July 1952, at S-Site, Security Station 610, I observed an object traversing NE-sharply in structure, directly overhead, the distance I was unable to determine, the object was motionless when first sighted and appeared to have wings. The object remained motionless for approximately ten (10) seconds, than as it began to move, the wings disappeared. The object had no glare and appeared light brown in color. The object moved very fast when movement began, in a northwest direction, taking about three (3) seconds to disappear. I was unable to determine whether the object disappeared behind the horizon, or disappeared in the distance close to the horizon. There wasn't any apparent sound, odor, or any evidence of a vapor trail. There weren't any clouds. The sky when object was sighted, by attention was attracted to the object while looking for jets from Albuquerque, which had been reported previously over the radio from the airstrip. This is the first object of this type I have seen."

SUBJECT: PLZOBRPT

In accordance with AFL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: PLZOBRPT), the following report of unidentified flying objects is submitted:

On 29 July 1952 at approximately 2250 MST, [redacted] (an employee of the [redacted] Operations at Albuquerque, N.M.) observed an unidentified image southwest of the city. In the observed, this object for two to three minutes.

This image held steady throughout the sighting at an elevation of approximately 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon. The object seemed to be a flattened ellipse, and it was a dull yellow when first sighted; however, there was a distinct change in color. It changed first to a pale yellow, then to a yellowish white, and finally, just before disappearance, to a clear white. Throughout this change the image appeared to continue emanating rays of the same changing color as the image itself. Before and after change and disappearance there were no events related to the image.

The reliability of the observer is considered excellent.

SIGN STATEMENT

[Redacted name], Communications Section, Protective Forces Women, Atomic Energy Commission, Los Alamos, do hereby make the following statement:

I saw it at approximately 11:00 MDT on 29 July. It was observed from the airport tower. It was within sight from approximately 40-50 miles to 15 miles. Color of the object was white, metallic. No definite shape of object is hard to estimate not knowing the altitude. As first seen nearly directly overhead, moved off in a S to westerly direction. I then turned to another observer and pointed it out. He also saw the object out of the observer's sight about this time the vapor trails from the jet were visible. With the aid of our Dominic Sights Section we discovered it was a satellite, who was in contact that it was able to observe, not able to be within approximately eight miles, the object, then a V.O. moved to be within approximately eight miles, the object disappeared from sight.

No exhaust trails were visible from the object. At one very brief instance, less than a second, the object, as seen to slow down for a blinking motion and lines or rings were visible momentarily. This air move so quickly that I cannot so define.

Los Alamos, New Mexico, is hereby make the following statement:

The time I sighted this object was at 1055 ADT on the 29th of July. It was above me and a little north east. It was called to my attention by the Security Station S.O. They had spotted it over the airfield and the looking for it. I heard the radio chatter over the Security radio this just before being sent in from Albuquerque and we had time to walk out and notice this object was in site, first we noticed it was brownish in color.

It was shaped wider and flatter than any aircraft I have seen and it seemed quite different.

We had log had about three miles or west of the airfield. The object gave off no exhaust and was quite silent. I could tell it was not a conventional aircraft. It was close to 20,000 ft. altitude. I will tell the speed in accordance with my knowledge. It was faster than any job I have ever seen. I have seen a lot of jets while in the Civil Air Patrol and I know about the speed and size of these.

This object was egg shaped in form with a brownish color and didn't leave any vapor trail or any sound when it vanished.

We saw it for about six to ten seconds. No time in the air, and then it disappeared. Approximately large seconds to disappear. It seemed to be flying just above toward the horizon and a few just vanished from sight. After that we saw the jets coming up from Albuquerque.

I, [redacted], Air Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

The size of the object as far as I could tell was round which could have been due to the altitude. Size was very small. The color was a shiny metallic. There was just one object. I could tell no aerodynamic features. There was no exhaust trail. I would venture to say that nature which would answer the question of propulsion. Once I would have been able to give fastest jobs. It was flying stationary and level at a constant speed and altitude. When I first looked it was about 1,500 ft. off to talk to some area lines and was unable to pick the object up again.

The line of sighting was approximately 50° to the object space and in another two minutes, I flew an exactly 190° from my position. Sector of observation was visual den just the naked eye. Location of the observation was at the Los Alamos air strip. Location of the object was approximately 220°.

As far as I am concerned, what I saw could have been a conventional aircraft. I have been flying continuously since 1941. I spent two years flying military aircraft and have fairly close containance with present type aircraft. I was between ten and twelve thousand acres in the air.

STATEMENT OF WITNESSES

[Location redacted], Florida

I had heard over the radio that objects had been spotted in Cuba, so/here looking toward the west. At intervals something before 10 saw first after looking about 1/2 hour. About 10:30 was going into NE to SW. Then I started seeing them about every 15 minutes after that, say 3 or 4 at a time. They weren't together though they were going from the east to the west. They were bluish-white and going at such a high rate of speed that you could only see them for a fraction of a second. However, the 2 lower ones looked to Yellowish-white. Toned out for about 10 longer than you could then see. They didn't look at all like falling stars.

(Signed)
West Palm Beach, Florida

Well, I am now charge of lights. The reason I didn't think they were shooting stars was because they seemed to be coming from somewhere else. They seemed to be coming from every direction. Some had their eye on them like meteors and others didn't. I might tell you just they were going. I just know they were going at a high rate of speed. The others in the group could distinguish was more of a bluish-white.

(Signed)
West Palm Beach, Florida

I was sitting in the patio watching the sky then saw streaks in the sky. So I joined it in watching. We watched at intervals of 2 minutes at intervals of 2 minutes we could see the objects. I saw 2 or 3 at a time. Streaks were going very fast. The first one made a right angle turn. It either made a turn or gave the appearance of a right angle turn. It had a bluish, color and gave the appearance of being higher than anything else. I have never seen anything like it before. These things to the best of my knowledge were going in a straight line. These things could make an object go so high-just like a light streak that we could see. I would say that they probably went through an arc of about 25 degrees, flashed, and then they were gone. That is about the extent of that.

REMARKS:
Mr. [redacted] and astronomer of West Palm Beach, Florida, expressed the opinion that the objects referred to above were meteors.

4. It is possible that the time of these sightings was meteorological in nature, but the observers were quite positive that what they saw was not a balloon, aircraft, or other natural explanation. While he thought all of the recent sightings could be attributed to either hallucinations or misidentifications...

I had heard over the radio that objects had been spotted in Cuba, so I was looking for them. It was quite sometime after I saw them after I started looking, about 1/2 hour. About 10:30 it was going from NE to SW. Then I started seeing them about every 15 minutes after that, my 3 or 4 at a time. They were yellowish-white, though would be a little space in between. They looked as though they were going from the east to the west. They were bluish-white and going at such a high rate of speed that you could only see them for a fraction of a second. However, the 1 have noted yellowish-white. For one could see the longer than the others. I saw them up to about 12 o'clock when I saw the last one. They didn't look at all like falling stars.

I came in about 10:30 and they were standing in the patio watching the sky then. said that he had seen a couple of these light streaks in the sky. So I joined in watching for them, about every 15 minutes at intervals of 2 or 3 minutes we could see light streaks. The first time I saw were almost directly overhead going west. There were 2 then - one went over and 2 or 3 minutes later there was another one. The part 2 I saw was almost due west. One made a right angle turn traveling west or made a dip and then flying the appearance of a right angle turn. All were a blue-white color. We were all watching. It was about the appearance of a searchlight beam. In the sky, the appearance of a wide-spread almost 30 minutes later. It was well the appearance of a turn beforehand I have seen were straight. These things to the best of my knowledge were extremely light, so high that we could not make out an object at all. They were very high, so high that we could see, I would say that they probably went through an arc of about 25 degrees, flashed, and then they were gone. That is about the extent of that.

All I saw were flashes of light. The reason I didn't think they were shooting stars was because they were going straight across and not falling. They seemed to be going from every direction. Some had tails on them above mentioned other than this. I can't tell you her first observation. I just know they were going at a high rate of speed. The color as far as I could distinguish was more of a bluish-white.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

PLACE RECORDED: New Mexico

DATE OF REPORT: 31 July 1952

REPORTED BY (Officer): Capt William F. Ryans, Asst Intel Officer

FROM (Agency): 6th Bombardment Wing, Heavy

DATE OF INFORMATION: 29 July 1952

EVALUATION: A-1

REFERENCES: Weather Observers, Walker AFB, N.M.

SUMMARY:

1. Between 0820 and 0940 on 29 July 1952 four weather observers, including the Base Weather Officer, at Walker AFB observed a number of unidentified flying objects through a theodolite.

2. It was not possible to determine the altitude of the unidentified objects, but it is known that they were higher than a weather balloon which was under observation at 20,000 feet.

3. The objects were described as metallic in color.

4. Size of the objects could not be determined, but they appeared smaller on the scope than the weather balloon, which had a diameter of approximately 6 feet at 20,000 feet.

5. Speed of the objects was much faster than conventional aircraft, requiring rotating the theodolite at maximum rate in order to track them.

6. The general track of the objects was NE to SW or ENE to WSW, but two objects were observed with widely different tracks.

7. The scientific experience of the weather personnel making these observations is sufficient to warrant credence in their sightings and indicates an actual appearance of unidentified flying objects.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

6th Bomb Wing, Heavy                     IR-38-52                     PAGE    2    OF    4

1. A/1C EDWIN L. WHITNEY, AF 18 298 968, weather observer with Weather Detachment 2-6 at WALKER AIR FORCE BASE (39° 15'N - 104° 32'W), ROSWELL, New Mexico, was observing a weather balloon on 29 July 1952 through a "spotter" telescope, from the theodolite tower, a 14-foot structure located on the line at WALKER AFB, when at 0820 hours a small, bright object crossed his field of vision. A moment later a second, similar object came into his field of vision and was tracked by WHITNEY through the theodolite. Between 0820 and 0825 (approximately) he observed five objects of the same nature, tracking three of them.

2. WHITNEY was then joined on the tower by Major HENRY BALDI, AO 424 348, Base Weather Officer, and two other airmen from the weather station, equipment technician T/Sgt WARREN T. HOLLINGSWORTHY, AF 18 169 266, and weather observer S/Sgt CARL SKRYA, AF 15 272 319, each of whom observed one or more of the objects through the theodolite between 0825 and 0940.

3. The objects were described as being metallic in color, resembling aluminum or silver. They brightly reflected the sun's rays. No flame or means of propulsion was evident.

4. FOUCCS stated that in shape the objects resembled a grain of wheat (although not pointed).

5. The objects were determined to be beyond the weather balloon under observation when it burst. 32 minutes after initial sighting at approximately 20,000 feet. Observers were unable to estimate their altitude with any degree of accuracy.

6. As the altitude (or altitudes) at which the objects were sighted was unknown, it was impossible to estimate their size. Before the weather balloon burst, WHITNEY observed that they were somewhat smaller in proportion to the field of vision of the theodolite than the balloon itself. (The balloon was approximately 20,000 feet in diameter of approximately 6 and one-half feet.) The objects did not appear uniform in size, but this difference was small enough that it could be explained by unequal altitudes.

7. The speed of the objects was described as "terrific" and was estimated greater than that of jet aircraft. Tracking them with the theodolite necessitated a high rate of movement. Conventional aircraft at operational altitudes can be followed nearly nearly. When the objects were picked up directly above the observers (or closely above ground) they were tracked approximately 10 degrees above the horizon, where they would disappear into the distance. This required from one to two minutes.

8. The objects followed a general path of northeast to southwest, or east-northeast to west-southwest. However, on two occasions two objects were observed simultaneously in the theodolite with varying tracks.

Description of Object: Object appeared to be very bright, whitish in color and circular in shape. Observers say that it was definitely round and that it was flat on the bottom. Object moved from northwest to southeast at an altitude of nearly 15,000 feet. Observers were unable to estimate exact speed (about 200 miles per hour seems unable to estimate). Object moved overhead of observers for a period of 3-4 minutes. There was a pause, some vapor trails. Then first sighted again at a point approximately at a 50° angle to the Horizon and was noted as an angle of 30°. Object moved over Cessna Aircraft Factory which is in the near vicinity.

Time of Sighting: Object sighted at 1235 hours. Object in sight approximately 5 minutes.

Range of Observation: Visually from the ground. No optical or electronic equipment used.

Details of Observation: Both observers were located at 37°38'N - 97°16'W. They were adjacent to the Terminal Building of the Wichita Municipal Airport.

Weather: (Illegible section)

At 1228 on 29 July was clear sky, 90° temperature, 15 miles visibility. (Checked with Base Weather)

At 1235 hours on 29 July there were (partially obscured text)

The reliability of the observers is unknown and the information cannot be confirmed. However, they have been with the Air Force either as airmen or civilians for the past eight years. These men work around jet aircraft since this base has B-33's and B-47's assigned. They work near the Municipal Airport Terminal and close to Cessna Aircraft Factory. This affords them the opportunity to see almost every type of military or civilian aircraft. These men saw an unusual object and should have been able to identify either a B-47 or B-36.

In the first instance, HOLLINGSWORTH was tracking one object, holding it in the position on the scope which is indicated by the point "A" in the above diagram. The track across the scope is indicated by the arrow pointing to "B". A second object was seen to appear through the telescope at point "C" and moved on an inverse heading, turned left and crossed in front of object A and moved off the scope to point "D". Its rate of closure on object "A" was described as "faster than a jet aircraft".

In the second instance, SPINA was observing an object in the position indicated by "E" in the diagram. A second object appeared at "F" moving approximately the same heading as object "E" and moving at a faster speed across the scope. As it approached object "E" it turned in an inverse heading and moved off the scope at point "G". In the previous eight to ten minutes, the second object remained on the scope less than a second. SPINA was unable to state whether there was a difference in the relative speed of the two objects during actual operations.

9. A total of six objects were observed during the period 0825 to 0940. During the first part of the period, the objects became more apparent. This could be explained by the fact that the sky was becoming less deep in color, and the change in the direction of the sun's rays may have been less favorable for detection. In any event, in view of the field of vision, which is 2 degrees, it seems reasonable to assume that the detected objects may have represented only a small proportion of the ones which were in the atmosphere at the time.

In accordance with AFR 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Object Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBEPT), the following report of unidentified flying object is submitted:

On 28 July 1952 at approximately 1310 MST, A/C No. 50-1000 with 1/Lt. Lange, USAF, observed a very bright object 30,000 to 40,000 feet over Sandia Base, New Mexico. This object flashed brightly in the western area for some time and moved to bob back and forth. At first it appeared to be a star-like object of the cigar shape that it had when first sighted. This object was observed for about 7 or 8 minutes. Then, it started to descend very rapidly, and suddenly, it ceased descending and began to gain altitude. It changed shape, gained altitude, it headed SE, and in about a minute disappeared.

The observer is considered good.

I, A/1c [redacted], 17th WAP Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On the 26th of July 1952, while sunbathing in the WAP area about 1300 MST, noticed a very bright object directly overhead between an altitude of 30,000 and 40,000 feet. At first, I thought that this was another aircraft, so I didn't pay too much attention to it. I kept my attention fixed on it for a period of approximately 3 minutes, and noticed that it remained in the same spot. During that time, it seemed to be bobbing up and down, and as seemed a 1 or 2 degree arc luminous - a bright metallic silver. I, then, called A/2c [redacted] attention to it, pointing out the spot, and she immediately saw the object. Together, we watched for a period of about 5 minutes and decided to report it to the Command Controller at the 38th Air Division (Def). While walking to the WAP orderly room, we met A/2c [redacted] and called her attention to this object. While the three of us were watching it, 16 started moving in a southwestern direction and seemed to be losing altitude. After a few seconds, it began to gain altitude and disappeared. As it disappeared, it seemed to gain speed.

I, A/2c [redacted], 17th WAP Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On-28 July 1952 at approximately 1310 MST, I saw an object 30,000 to 40,000 feet directly over Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. This object was luminous in color- not dulled by the atmospheric conditions that usually make a silver or white object less its brightness. It stayed in the same area bobbing back and forth, and at times, it appeared to be "Y" shaped instead of cigar-shaped.

I observed this object for about 7 or 8 minutes. Then, it started to descend very rapidly, and suddenly, it stopped descending and began to gain altitude. As it gained altitude, it headed SE, and in about a minute, it completely disappeared.

1. In accordance with instructions via phone this date, transmit herewith is the film released to this office by the Commander
Ops Losin Marine Base and five inclosures relating to the subject.

2. PFC ███████ interviewed 31 July and stated substantially as follows:

3. This object was sighted 2130 hours 29 July 1952. It was described as being orange to yellow, of extreme brilliance and incandescent glow. The object was moving as a tangent to the earth of 15 degrees above the horizon. From the beginning to the end of observation, from the beginning of observation to fading away in the distance, the time was 3-1/2 minutes diagonal. There was no trail, no sound, and no vibration. The object passed between the clouds and the ground, and this object passed before the clouds and the ground were quite dark. There was no comparison of size possible. From our conversation, it seems that the object was moving at a very high rate of speed, making an arc II miles in a clear visual with 1.67 arc seconds, lasting approximately 24 hours per second, with a 4-1/2 inch movement, passing in front of the clouds, 3 miles in a magnitude, most probably 10 miles distant. The movement of the object was on the direct line of the film as it came off the wall.

3. This office has released no information to the public regarding this sighting nor any other.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Colonel Gilbert - AFOIN-4A
Mr. Archer - AFOIN-4

SUBJECT: UFO Matter Reported to D/I, AFOIN-X

The following incident, and action taken as result thereof, is reported over your warning the attached year office:

a. At approximately 1550 hours Friday, 7 August 1952, this office received a telephone call from Mr. [redacted] of Cleveland, Ohio. According to Mr. [redacted], the staff was preparing a TV presentation "The Close Approach of Mars to Earth".

b. Mr. [redacted] demanded the detailed results and analysis of a "flying film" which he took in July 1952, and subsequently turned over to the ONI Intelligence. This information was, somehow, to be used as part of the presentation.

c. Mr. [redacted] was informed that we could not release information on this from our files, and that authority from Headquarters USAF would be required to do so. Therefore, advised to contact the PIO, Headquarters USAF.

d. Indignant and somewhat angry, Mr. [redacted] pressed the matter by demanding the information, stating that he had a contract deadline to meet. The policy reiterated our policy regarding release of information to the public. Mr. [redacted] was advised that no official in the office could release his queries to the Air Force Public Information Office would be inefficient.

e. In compliance with established policy on matters of this nature, referral to him was immediately contacted since the matter would eventually be referred to this office. In as much as possible, we remain as a later date.

f. Our records reveal that some newspaper publicity was given this matter and the explanation given this case was "unknown". This appears to be appropriate as there is considerable data upon which to formulate a conclusion. Attached is a summary of the case, a correlation with AFOIN-X, is attached (Incl. B). Also attached is a confirmation of file (Incl. A).

g. As a matter of record, this telephone conversation was being tape recorded.

Since completion of telephone conversation was after duty hours, the undersigned was unable to coordinate and bring the matter to the attention of the Director. However, a tape recording has been made and the anticipated action is believed warranted, under the circumstances.

All material referred here will be made a part of the UFO case file.

SUBJECT: Brief Summary of Re-Evaluation _______ Sighting July 29, 1952
(Transcript of evaluation, per telephone conversation to AFOIN-X, 7 Sep 56)

The following are those points and data of significance which lead to a final conclusions:

1. Three (3) Navy fliers stated that they observed a similar object at approximately the same time and location and their impression was that the object was a "meteor". (Miami Herald dated July 31, 1952)

2. We should like to point out than an annual meteoric shower, the Aquarids, are at their peak of intensity between July 26th through August 5th. These meteors, which are very fast and brilliant, originate in the constellation Aquarius. This constellation is located in the eastern part of the sky at that time as is the moon. (Reference Mr. ______'s statement that is so-called "flying saucer" passed near or across the moon.)

3. In also personal statement, _______ states that the unidentified flying object was some time ago brilliantly seen at a star. Also, newspaper which published blow-ups of his picture pointed out that the object had a small tail.

4. Psychological Aspects: Strange part of the story is from _______ own statement that "I met a bunch I would see a saucer". Also, "I went to a _______ apartment to wait on the possibility that a saucer may appear again in his life". This statement definitely establishes, at least, anticipation or confidence on ______'s part that a saucer would appear for him. Strange! (Captain Gregory's comment): Saucer's just don't appear just because you wish them to be there.

5. Also, his statement "I began shooting pictures because I might be the only person to get a color picture of this." (Comment: a question arises: Was this an unconscious admission to the interrogator interviewing him that he was striving toward this end?)

6. Conclusion: If we discount the statement that he observed the object for 3-1/2 minutes (and it has been proven by psychological tests that most people under stress and excitement will, then the object, on the basis of other correlated and supported data given above, was possibly a meteor.

7. Colonel Johnson: This is submitted in the event that the matter which we discussed last Thursday afternoon may come to a head or result in a potential controversy (public relations' view) so far as the Air Force is concerned. It is offered for whatever action or use you may deem necessary. No action or information will be released without specific approval or authority from you regarding this matter.

'Flying Saucer' Film Elusive, Too
By WILSON HIRSCHFELD

The Cleveland Plain Dealer

The is to advise you that a film of the Air Technical Intelligence Center here is being sought by a photographer who claims he shot a "flying saucer" in the night sky over Miami, Fla., last summer.

The photographer, Ralph G. Mayher, a 21-year-old Cleveland TV station film editor, wants to show the world what he believes are flying saucers.

Mayher brought his film to the "Plain Dealer" where it was examined. But it still remains with naval intelligence.

A letter from the Department of Defense dated April 13, 1954, confirms that some purpose by the Pentagon letter was signed by R. C. White, then lieutenant, Office of Public Information.

The Pentagon letter was signed by R. C. White, first lieutenant, Office of Public Information.

What Is It?
Ralph Mayher, photographer for a Cleveland TV station, while he made his picture in the Miami area, described the object as a bright, shining object, disk-shaped and changing in size and form. He said it was about 2,000 feet distant.

Later, he said, he interviewed three airline pilots who saw mysterious objects that night. He hopes for another chance to capture the mystery traveler on film. Maybe he'll get a vigil many nights in readiness. But he never will again.

He believes that the flying saucers have been dispatched from another world which has become curious about our ways and seeks explanations.

Next month PRC will carry an article about his experience with flying saucers, Mayher said.

He is now employed as a film editor for Television Station WEWS, He lives at 1473 W. 106th Street.

Four views of the "flying Saucer" that flashed over Miami Beach last night are reproduced here from the film taken by Marine Pfc. Ralph C. Mayher. The film was released without comment by Third Marine Air Wing officials.

Miami Daily News artists did not retouch the "saucer" itself, which loses some detail in reproduction, but did retouch scratches on the film and designated the object with arrows.

The photos show the "orange, yellowish object" was bowl-shaped with a projection on top. It speedily vanished, after being watched for more than three minutes.

MIAMI'S SAUCER?

Marine Here Snaps 'Disc'

By LARRY STINGEL (Miami Daily News Staff Writer)

A strange "orange, yellowish object" traveling at more than 2,000 m.p.h. was photographed last night by a Marine cameraman watching from a Miami Beach home.

Forty feet at dim exposure on the film, the object was caught by the Marine, who was watching the sky, the Marine described it.

Only eight frames of the film were used, and the Marine said they saw for about three minutes the object maneuvering.

Snapped around 9:13 p.m. by Pfc. Ralph C. Mayher, 22, of NE 79th St., and Cleveland, Ohio, Air Station in Opa-locka officials at the picture and informed at 5 p.m. today a witness statement.

The film were done from the patio of the home of Herman Stern, 220 Byron Ave. where and his wife two days ago reportedly were "trying something."

The film showed 6 images with 1 photo with 4 different views. The object appeared to be traveling at a "crystal clear" speed, it was so fast.

The Lockheed said to want to see the film, he was told by an official, to go to the Marine base.

This A Saucer?

Neighbors Noticed -

About 9:30 p.m. they heard neighbors phoning "Look there," pointing to the sky.

For several seconds, "We saw nothing." Then an orange, yellowish - shaped object appeared. I pulled out my camera and shot about 10 feet of film. After more shots, the object disappeared. Might have been the sky, along with other objects in the area.

The Marine then called Joe Dolcater, chief of the Public Information Office, and obtained the film. Acting officials at the Air Station had no comment to make.

They stressed the fact Mayher was acting in a personal capacity, "All we did," one officer said, "was release the film."

Four views of the "flying saucer" that flashed over Miami Beach last night are reproduced here from the film taken by Marine Pfc. Ralph C. Mayher. This was released without comment by Third Marine Wing officials. Miami Daily News artists did not reproduce the exact shape, which loses some detail in reproduction, but did retouch scratches on the film and redesignated the object with arrows. The photos show the "orange, yellowish object" was bow-shaped with a projection on top. It speeded, after being watched for more than three minutes.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Four views of the "flying saucer" that flashed over Miami Beach are reproduced here from the film taken by Marine C. Ralph C. Mayher. The film was developed recently by Jack Leising. Marine Wing Headquarters. These views will give some detail in regard to the "saucer" itself, which was some detail in explanation of the object still shown. The photos show the object, colored dark, oval-shaped with a white border, nearly vanished after being watched for more than three minutes.

MIAMI'S SAUCER?

Marine Here
Snaps 'Disc'
A Marine Corps photographer caught a colorful object at more than 12,000 feet altitude last night by a wing headquarters camera at Miami Beach home.

He had requested permission to take pictures of the sky and was told to shoot at will. About 6 p.m. they were his with a 16-inch telephoto lens. He developed the film and found the strange object.

He was acting as a photographer for the Marine Air Group at Miami. They were his with a 16-inch telephoto lens. About 6 p.m. they were his with a 16-inch telephoto lens.

The rest of the text is largely illegible due to poor image quality and scanning artifacts.

The headline reads "Marine Here Snaps 'Disc'" and the subheadline suggests this is about a Marine photographer capturing an unusual object in the sky over Miami Beach.

1. Enclosures (1) and (2) are forwarded herewith to substantiate the report contained in the following paragraph.

2. On the morning of 29 July 1952, Private First Class [redacted], attached to and serving with Station Operations, Marine Air Station, Miami, Florida, was at Miami Beach, Florida, where he was assigned to the Public Information Office, with a 16 millimeter movie camera which he intended for practice purposes from the Marine Corps Air Station Public Information Laboratory. At 2125 on the same evening Private First Class [redacted] while at Miami Beach reportedly saw what is commonly referred to as a "flying saucer" traveling from east to west over Miami Beach. Using the 16 MM movie camera, he proceeded to take a picture of the object.

3. Calling the Marine Corps Air Station, Private First Class [redacted] contacted the Officer of the Day and informed him that a civilian had called the Miami Beach Police Department with a story concerning the objects. During the conversation, Private First Class [redacted] gave no statement to the press and held the film.

4. The morning the film was turned over to the Public Information Officer for development. The film was processed under the supervision of the Public Information Officer. All during the processing, members of the press were calling requesting what the distribution would be and what it contained.

5. Since there was so much interest shown in the film by the press, this Command decided to make the photographs public to avoid having the press build up the story to a point where the general public would think that the Marine Corps had some very spectacular pictures.

6. During the morning of 30 July 1952, the two Miami newspapers, the Herald and the Daily News, made calls requesting prints of the object which had been filmed. They were told at that time by the Public Information Officer of the Marine Corps Air Station that this Command had no statement to make regarding the pictures and that they had been taken in the off-duty hours of the photographer, Private First Class [illegible]. This Command gave no official sanction to the pictures. They were merely released in the public interest.

7. A Miami Herald staff writer, G. J. SMITH, called the Public Information Officer and asked whether or not this Command had any statements to make. He was told that they did not. He informed the Public Information Officer at that time that he was going to call Washington to find out what they thought about it, and he was informed by the Public Information Officer that 10 or 12 prints, apparently called Colonel J. K. SMITH of Air Force Intelligence in Washington D. C., was quoted in the Herald story as saying that the Air Force was interested in all such evidence and would take steps immediately to get copies of the film.

8. During the afternoon of 30 July 1952, Captain John MC CABE, Public Information Officer of the Marine Corps Air Station, contacted the Naval Intelligence Officer in this area, Lieutenant Commander NEVILLE, The Public Information Officer gave him the reasons for releasing the information in the manner in which it was done. Lieutenant Commander NEVILLE has 21 lines of prints turned over to him on 31 July 1952, and that he would forward them to Headquarters, Sixth Naval District, for evaluation.

9. In the afternoon of 31 July 1952, a conference was held in the office of the Commanding Officer, Marine Corps Air Station, with Major William J. FRAKER, United States Air Force Intelligence, Mr. DOUGLAS of the Office of Naval Intelligence, and a Mr. HAMILTON of the United States Air Force Special Investigations. Private First Class [illegible] USMC, was interrogated by the Air Force personnel. The film was turned over to Major FRAKER Jr. for forwarding to proper Air Force authorities. The prints, nine (9), were made by television station WTVJ. These prints were released by that station upon request of this Command, for such action as the Commandant may desire to take.

31 July 1952

STATEMENT OF PFC. [redacted] 308-3, MCAS, Miami, Fla.

After hearing talk of flying saucers for the past two years or more and then hearing that a so-called saucer had been seen over Miami beach by Mr. [redacted] on the 26th of July, 1952, I decided to take home a camera and there just sat in my home and watched. Then I decided to take a few shots and actually talk to some one when had seen one. I had a hunch that if he reacted usually some something Monday, it might reappear just as those saucers reappeared.

I took my [redacted] over to Miami beach. We finally located his and I got my story from him. In the time was about 9:45 p.m. After hearing his story I was very skeptical. I second rather fantastic. I would like if we went to the back of his eyes, and wait. Mr. [redacted] was visiting Mr. [redacted]. I identified myself and told them I had a hunch, his permission was granted. This was really a hunch I was working on; there was no official business involved.

I finally was seated in a [redacted] patio from 9:15 some to 9:30 p.m. nothing happened and I made a little joke out of it, said no flying saucers man yet. At 9:38 it was far from a joke. The object appeared, it was start-ling. The object or saucer was a bright orange disk shape. I was not the first one to see it. People in the West bank of the river said there was flying object over the bank. I immediately jumped to my feet and screamed to them - is there anything in the sky? They said Yes. I didn't see it immediately, on apartment from my watch. I began taking pictures. It was at a tremendous altitude. I couldn't appreciate because there were no clouds to give my appreciation. But to my size of a pin head compared to a half dollar. After 16 seconds of wing of a pad, I began shooting movies of the object. It was so small through my range finder that I could barely see it. Focusing, I might be the only person on earth to get visible pictures of this, I began shooting by appreciating its location and by making sure the object would remain stationary on a perfectly straight course at tremendous speed. I took 40 feet of film approx. 12 frames have an image. The photo-graphs show change in shape and surface. I was surprised that it means visible when it was over, only visible on the several film. It was so much more brilliant than a star about 3 times as bright.

STATEMENT

My name [REDACTED] Lieutenant Colonel, USAF. I am a rated Military Pilot (Imagine) with approximately 1500 hours of flying time. I am presently employed as an [REDACTED] in the at Albuquerque, New Mexico.

At approximately 2230 hours, Mountain Standard Time, on Tuesday, July 29, 1952, I stepped into the front yard of my house at [REDACTED], Albuquerque, and saw an unidentified image southwest of my position. Continuous observation during the ensuing two to three minutes produced the following data:

BEARING: The image held steady on a bearing of approximately 225 degrees from my position [REDACTED] drive is not oriented N-S or E-W, making exact determination of bearing difficult). The bearing was approximately 4 to 5 degrees less from my position than the bearing of the Kirtland Air Force Base weather weathervane, which was operative, and visible at the time of sighting.

ELEVATION: The image held steady throughout the sighting at an elevation of approximately 20 ± 25 degrees above the horizon.

SIZE: When originally sighted the image had a horizontal axis of a length to be encompassed by an angle of 2 to 4 degrees (I believe it was more likely about 4 degrees). Any other estimate of size is impossible since I could not judge its distance over land nor its height.

APPEARANCE: When originally sighted the image seemed to be a flattened ellipse, slightly distorted or obscured (perhaps by low cloud clouds) in the lower left-hand portion. In color it was a dull yellow approximately the shade of American cheese. Light rays the same color as the image, and approximately 1/2 to 1 length of the horizontal axis, appeared to be emanating from the image in all directions.

For approximately 50 to 60 seconds after the original sighting the image continued in size and appeared unchanged. Then it began to shrink in size gradually and within approximately 15 seconds after the change had started disappeared to sight completely. During this change the image did not change its apparent bearing or elevation, indicating that if it was moving it was moving directly away from the point of observation. This change in size was accompanied by a distinct change in color, from a pale yellow, then to a yellowish white, and finally, just before disappearance, to a clear white. Throughout the change the image appeared to continue to emanate rays of the same changing color as its size.

SOUND: Before and after change and disappearance there was no sound audible to the observer which seemed related to the image.

Navy Fliers See Similar Sky Object
By G. J. SMITH
The big "flying saucer" talk in Albuquerque got a boost Tuesday when photographs of a glowing disc taken by a Marine Corps photographer were developed.

LAYMER, the photographer, Pfc. Ralph Layher, Marine Corps photographer at Opaloosa Marine Air Base. But even with the disc on film, all sources, official and unofficial, agreed it was a "flying saucer."

SOMETHING LIKE A "SAUCER" is this glowing disc which was photographed Tuesday night by a Marine Corps photographer at Holloman Air Force Base. Red lines were photographed with a telephoto lens and the trans were shown here were photographed in actual conditions. Pic. Ralph Mayher, who the object was so much and going so fast he had difficulty sighting it through his view-finder. "I just pointed the camera in its general direction and hoped I would get something," he said. The object showed up a sight larger on the film. The source of the film is being kept a close secret in Washington, D.C. has asked for copies of the pictures for study.

Officials at the Marine Air Base with Mayher's photographer, who didn't know what was to do about the picture, went out to take the pictures but it wasn't official. Wednesday the supervisors approved to wish the whole matter dropped.

MIAMI'S SAUCER?

Marine Here Snaps 'Disc'
By LARRY BIRGER, Miami Daily News Staff Writer

A strange "orange, yellowish object" traveling at more than 2,000 miles an hour was photographed last night by a Marine cameraman from a Miami Beach home.

Forty feet of film were taken of the object as it flashed across the sky, the Marine reported, however, showed any image.

Only eight frames of the film. The "object," which observers said they saw for about three minutes and 30 seconds, was photographed around 9:33 p.m. by Ralph C. Mayher, 22, of 60 NE 78th St., and Cleveland, O.

Officials at the Marine Corps Air Station in Opa-locka released the pictures and information at 2 p.m. today without comment.

Sheer From Paris
The film was shot from the patio of the home of Herman Stern, 8200 Byron Ave. Stern and his wife two days ago reported spotting "flying saucers" in the sky. The film showed a bowl-shaped image with a projection on top. The object looked like a ball of fire was moving enough, however, to be diagnosed as a flying saucer or meteor.

Mayher said what he saw in the sky was "crystal clear" and that as fast as it was traveling, he noted detail in the object, or photographed it.

Dr. Zuckernick said, he went to the home of the Sterns on his own initiative. He checked out the 16-millimeter camera from the MCAS yesterday afternoon, the Sterns then watched the sky from their home. Along were his wife, Eleanor, and a friend. They arrived at the Stern home about 9:05 p.m.

Neighbors Shouted
About 9:30 p.m., they heard neighbors shout, "Look there, in the sky!" For several seconds, Mayher recalled, "We saw nothing. Then an orange, yellowish - shaped object appeared. I pulled out my camera and shot about 40 feet of film."

After more than three minutes, the object disappeared. Mayher said his wife and the friend saw the object, along with other residents in the area.

The Marine then called the officer-of-the-day at Opa-locka, and he and a Public Information Office sergeant went to the Stern house and obtained the film.

Marine officials at the Air Station had no comment to make on the photos. They stressed the fact that Mayher was acting in a non-official capacity, "All we did was process the film," one officer commented.

YOU PAY YOUR MONEY...

Photographed Object
Is Called Plane's Light

The latest theory about the "or-only caught in a light frame, ange, yellowish object" seen and photographed over Miami Tuesday is that what was spotted was the front light of an airplane coming in for a landing at International Airport.

John L King, an aerial gunner during World War II, said today he is certain that what he saw in the vicinity of where the object was photographed by a Marine was the light from a plane

Films To Washington

A Miamian who works in the control tower at the field reported that a plane was due to land in Miami about 10 minutes after the object was seen in Sunrise. It was coming from the east, he added.

Pfc. Ralph Mayher, who was looking for "flying saucers" when he went to the home of Herman Stern, 820 Byron Ave, shot about 10 feet of film on the object. He said the pictures plus statements by Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gardner, Lt. Joe Mills, and Lt. L. J. W. Blum, Navy pilots who also said they saw the object, will be turned over to the Air Force in Washington.

It was reported, meanwhile, that the pictures, plus statements by Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gardner, Lt. Joe Mills, and Lt. L. J. W. Blum, Navy pilots who said they saw the object, will be turned over to the Air Force in Washington.

"On a hunch" Mayher went to the Sunrise home of Stern who (two nights earlier had reported seeing an object in the sky traveling at great speed). Mayher photographed the object on 16-millimeter film. He said it was traveling "more than 2,000 miles an hour."

Marine officials in Miami reported Stern said the photos were "crystal clear" and had "definite shape."

Blown up to 10 times its size from a 16-millimeter film negative, this is an unretouched photograph of an object seen by a Marine cameraman who was hunting for "flying saucers" at Miami Beach Tuesday night. The Air Force soon will scrutinize the picture.

Statement of [redacted] -2-

POSSIBILITY OF CONFUSION: The image was not confused with either the weather searchlight or the cloud for the glow image it produces; bearings were different, and there was a distinct difference in color; the searchlight cloud glow image being a bluish white and hazy while the image was a yellow and gave the impression of possessing some substance and solidity.

The image was not confused with the moon, which did set a few minutes later (2257 hours, MST). The bearing of the image was approximately 45 to 60 degrees less than that of the setting moon at this season, and the elevation was at least 30 degrees less than that at which the moon reaches a bearing of 225 degrees from my house at this season. Additionally, the moon on July 29, 1952 was in its first quarter, which would have made it appear sickle-shaped, while this image had the shape of a flattened ellipse.

The likelihood of mistaking a weather balloon being released from the CAA weather bureau office at Portland AFB seems unlikely. A weather balloon (almost no distance) would have been anchored by a much smaller angle. While possibly appearing quite bright if illuminated by a floodlight at immediate distance, it would probably not have appeared to emanate rays. And in the absence of strong visible a weather balloon would appear to change elevation rapidly, while the image appeared to change elevation not at all.

SUPPORTING WITNESSES: There were none present with the observer at the time of sighting.

I hereby swear that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

at Albuquerque, New Mexico, this 30th day of July, 1952.

South Florida
Reports Three
Flying Discs
By O. J. SMITH
Herald Staff Writer

Excited sky watchers from three
South Florida localities Monday
reported sighting mysterious discs
of light, fast-moving, weird acting
and answering the general descriptions given in recent "flying saucer" stories.

From Key West came the report
that Navy officials were grim and
tense—an indication of something
faster-than-sound in the area. Reporters hundreds of miles away
watched across the sky as the
watchers in outdoor movie Saturday night saw the discs.

Three Miami Beach residents reported seeing one of the glowing
objects hanging motionless in the
sky over Biscayne Bay, then
swooping away "hundreds of thousands of feet" in a few seconds,
"faster than any plane I've ever
seen," and disappearing in a matter of seconds.

A brilliant, glowing, orange ball,
with the same hanging and midair disappearing action, was reported
seen over Hollywood early Sunday
morning by a man who lives in
that community.

About the Key West report, one
Navy officer said, "There may be something to it, but I'm
not at liberty to say how many
of us who look seriously."

One witness described it as a
peculiar solid white object which
was seen from mid-to-late morning to about noon.

The Navy, at Key West, dispatched a Navy destroyer to investigate the flying saucers, but know I saw
this thing, and if was the fastest moving thing I've ever seen."

The Navy dispatched the USS
Greenwood, a destroyer or escort,
to investigate. Navy has no comment.

Mr. and Mrs. R. P. Goldstein,
720 Talum Waterway dr., Miami
Beach, and Mr. & Mrs. S. Stern, 820 By. Rd., Miami Beach, said they
saw the "mysterious light Monday
night" over Biscayne.

now the light I mistook it for the
moonlight was about that area. It
made motionless for about three or
four minutes.

"Then an airplane started
coming in near it. apparently on
its way to the airport. The disc
started moving slightly, then
picked up speed and zoomed up
over some of the parts of the
plane and out of sight, hundreds
of times faster than any plane
I've ever seen."

He said his wife saw the light
just before it started to move—slowly, and Mrs. Stern came out to
look at it just before it went out
of sight.

Thomas W. Soria, who lives in
the Hollywood Beach Trailer
Park, said he saw his "saucer"
when he awoke about 2 a.m. Sunday and could not get back to
sleep. He looked out a window of
his trailer and saw the brilliant
orange ball hanging about 2,000
feet high.

"It was the disc remained eerily
motionless for about three minutes, then suddenly began to wobble and disappeared rapidly eastward over the ocean, within a matter of seconds.

What Is It?

Ralph Mayer, photographer for a Cleveland TV station, said he made this picture of an unidentified flying object while he was serving in the Marine Corps in 1952. Mayer described the object as about 50 feet long and reddish-orange in color. He made movies of it, using a 60-mm lens and turned over all of the film except one frame, from which this picture was made, to the Air Force, who, he said, declined to comment on the object.

'Flying Saucer' Film Elusive, Too

BY WILSON HIRSCHFELD

A sharp controversy over the disappearance of some purported "flying saucer" film was related yesterday by a 24-year-old Clevelander who believes saucers are "something."

Ralph G. Mayher has brought to the Plain Dealer conflicting statements about the whereabouts of the film he shot in Miami the night of July 29, 1952. A letter from the Department of Defense, dated April 13, 1954, advises Mayher:

CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER, 25 Sep 54

This is to advise you that at the Search of the Air Technical Intelligence Center files has failed to show that the air force ever received the film which you earlier requested.

"It is our belief, that, since this film was originally submitted to a naval base, it must still remain with naval intelligence."

The Pentagon letter was signed by R. G. White, first lieutenant, Office of Public Information. Mayher then wired to the Miami station.

[Photograph of a man labeled "RALPH G. MAYHER"]

role in hush-hush investigation of flying saucers.

Shooting 16 feet of film that summer night, Mayher said he managed to catch the flying saucer on 18 frames. He described it as a "brightly shining object, disk-shaped and changing in size and form." He said it was about 2,000 feet distant.

Later, he said, he interviewed three airline pilots who saw the mysterious object that night. Hoping for another chance to capture the mystery traveler on film, Mayher kept vigil many nights on the ocean beach, camera in readiness. But he never saw it again.

He believes that the flying saucers have been dispatched from another world which may become anxious about our V-2s and atomic problems.

Next month PIC magazine will carry an article about his experience with flying saucers.

Mrs. [redacted] of Biscayne Keys, Florida reported an object at high altitude moving NNW over Biscayne Bay at 00:10 on 29 July 1952.

It appeared to be as large as a four engine transport. The object was circular and was iridescent, of considerable brilliance. It stopped over the edge of the city of Miami, where it hovered in place for almost [redacted] uses. Mrs. [redacted] called here two sisters who came out and watched it with her.

The object surveyed spontaneously red to green about every two seconds; while it was green a white aura was observed around the edges. When the object started moving again it surged in. A brilliant green, moved slowly at first and then faster. No motion other than directional was observed. There was no noise. Stops and starts were sudden.

Mrs. [redacted] is the wife of a Naval Officer. In 1950 she and her daughter observed a flying object over Jacksonville, Florida, which she described as S being round, rising to a [redacted] stop. She further described it as shaped like a child's Christmas top. She said the object was quite low, clearly visible, and reflected like sunlight from an auto windshield. Her husband was thought to have made a report on this observation to Naval authorities.

The flashing - burst - or surge of light from red to green at approximately every two seconds would perhaps be possibly or a conventional aircraft; however the intensity (Brilliance) of the light, circular shape, hovering, and definite stop and start weakens the aircraft hypothesis. The interviewing officer does not feel that Mrs. [redacted] is inclined to imaginative thinking or speculation.

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

On the evening of 29 July 1952 at approximately 1940 hours, Mr. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted] and their thirteen year old grandson were driving north on Greenfield Highway between Eight Mile Road and Nine Mile Road. All three members of the party observed an unconventional object in the sky to the north west of their position. The object was described as being the size of a full moon and the color of the sun. Mr. Stonburgh continued driving north for approximately one (1) mile, then turned off of the highway and attempted to locate the object with a pair of binoculars, but failed to do so.

The object was visible for approximately four minutes. Visitor S [redacted] estimated the altitude to be 3,500 feet. The object seemed to be in a steady climb of about 40 degrees, and disappeared by flying out of range of vision. No exhaust, vapor trail or sound was noticed by the observers.

Weather was clear, the sun was low in the sky. No air traffic was noticed by the observers although a municipal airport is in the area.

1. The object sighted was a single object, low on the horizon. No definite size could be determined. There was a distinctive changing of colors, repeating in sequence from blue, to bright red, to a blush-green. No trail or exhaust was visible.

2. Pilots of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Sqdn. who observed the object estimated its size at 20 to 30 feet. Chase of object saw the object increase its speed to remain approximately ten (10) miles away. The F-94B, which was indicating 350 knots (IAS) at 21,000 feet, closed the object several times but the object managed between twelve (12) o'clock and one (1) o'clock position. Due to lack of fuel, F-94B had to abandon chase. The flight which followed same route one-half hour later was unable to intercept.

3. The time of the sighting was from approximately 0640Z until 0500Z on 25 July 1952. The radar observation was both visually and by radar. The radar observer at the target area approximately fifty (50) seconds. From the radar scope, the observation was visual by both the chase and the F-94B aircraft at a speed of approximately 300 knots.

4. The object was sighted at a position twenty (20) miles due west of Fort Huron, New Mexico. At first sighting, the object was traveling at a distance of four miles.

5. The object was picked up on the scopes of the GCI and the F-94B. The pilot has had experience as a navigator, has had several celestial navigation, pilot observer close 1944.

STATEMENT

The undersigned, on the 29th of July, 1952, was on a routine training mission, acting in the capacity of radar observer. In our flight were two F-84B aircraft. We had just finished six intercepts on a B-45 aircraft at a approximate 5,000 feet. After completing our intercepts we started climbing out on a heading of 270 degrees to an altitude of 20,000 feet. When we reached that altitude, Avenger (GCI control) called us and asked us if we could see a target at three o'clock low. I replied that I could look low and could not see anything at all. We were then told to look high. My pilot, Captain Edward J. Slowinski, then started a starboard turn and as he did, I picked up a target on my scope at 60 degrees. I kept the pilot informed until I had the target at 12 o'clock, four miles out, when I looked on the blip. It gave me an airborne indication four miles level. I stayed on the target when the blip jumped lock. However, in that short space of time, I was able to determine that it was an airborne target four miles ahead and level with us. After it jumped look, our intercept was attempted visually. The pilot put the F-84B up to 380 knots (IAS) and gave chase. During the chase, GCI kept telling us we were not gaining at all. The target was staying approximately six to ten miles ahead of us. On my visual observation, the target kept putting off a white light in a definite sequence of white, red, and bluish-green. That is the only means of identification we had. From personal experience of study in celestial navigation and 1400 hours as a bombardier, radar observer, and navigator, I have never experienced any sighting like this before.

STATEMENT

On 29 July 1952, the undersigned was on a routine sight training flight. The flight consisted of two F-94B aircraft which were working intercepts on a B-26 aircraft at approximately 9,000 to 9,500 feet in altitude. After completing its intercepts on the B-26, the man was called and told to complete the intercept and follow the lead ship to a higher altitude. While climbing out on a heading of 270 degrees at an altitude of 20,000 feet, Avenger, the GCI station was called and asked if I could see a target at three o'clock low. I searched the area and found nothing. I informed Avenger of this, and was asked to search at three o'clock high. I started a starboard turn and my radar observer, Lt Kleinschmidt, called and said a target was at 2:30 level, four miles out. I informed Avenger of this, and was instructed to intercept the target. I observed lights on the target, and at first thought it was a jet aircraft. The time was approximately 2:40 (local). I turned to a heading of 360 degrees, and attempted to close on the target. After completing my turn, the radar observer informed me that he had lost radar contact, so the intercept was attempted without radar guidance. At approximately 20,000 feet for approximately twenty minutes at an airspeed as high as 360 knots (IAS), the chase was abandoned as fuel was getting low, and no gains could be made on the target. Throughout the chase, the object appeared to be flying off a changing light which had a definite sequence of white, red, and blue-green. No other means of identification could be made. During the attempted intercepts, GCI called and said that they had the target on their screens, and it appeared to keep from six to ten miles ahead of my aircraft.

CASE #8
29 July 1952                                                 Port Huron, Michigan

Description of Incident:
On the night of 29 July 1952 on AEW station in Michigan observed an unidentified return on the scope. The time was shortly before 2140 CST. The target was plotted at 550 knots on a 360 degree heading for 20 minutes.

Three F-94's B/W were in the area making practice runs on a 3-25. One of those a/c was requested by GCI to investigate the unknown target. The a/c climbed out of the practice area on a heading of 270 degrees to 20,000'. GCI called and requested a visual search be made at 3 o'clock. A turn was started when the radar operator got a lock-on from a target at 2:30 o'clock level, 4 miles away. The lock-on was held for only 30 seconds. As the turn was made, a bright, flashing, colored light was observed by the pilot. He turned into the light on a heading of 360 degrees and followed it for twenty minutes at an IAS of 350 knots at 21,000'. The light remained between 12 and 1 o'clock. At the time of the lock-on, the a/c was 20 miles W of Port Huron, Michigan.

The GCI radar was carrying both the unidentified target and the F-94 on the scope. Since the F-94 could not close, it was assumed by GCI that the object increased its speed to that of F-94's.

Comment:
Two other F-94 B/W were airborne, but they continued making practice runs on a 3-25 and were not in the area at the time of the sighting.

The star, Capella, is directly in line with the F-94's line of flight and the a/c would have been flying straight toward it. It is very low on the horizon and appears to be flashing green, blue, and red, etc. At first it was believed that this was the pilot saw, but when it was established that both the F-94 and the UFO were being carried on the GCI scope, Capella becomes a doubtful suspect.

It could be that this is a series of coincident weather phenomena affecting the

A balloon can be disregarded since the speeds are too high for even a jet stream.

Three weak invasions were noted below 10,000'.

Conclusion

Unknown

1956 Comments

The "lock on" is not considered to be significant since it lasted for only
30 seconds.

Pursuit contact lasted for 20 minutes; therefore, the speed of the target was
not greatly in excess of the passing aircraft.

The visual and radar descriptions do not vary widely from that of aircraft.

Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

In reply to your letter, AFOIN-ATIA-5, dated 2 October 1952, the following information has been obtained. Some of the information is unavailable due to the lapse of time between your letter and the original report.

a. The unidentified flying object appeared on the GCI scope for a period of approximately twenty (20) minutes. The object was traveling at a speed of approximately 550 miles per hour on a heading of 360 degrees, as determined by the GCI controllers. The object was one-quarter (1/4) inch long and rectangular in shape as it appeared on the scope.

b. GCI reports the speed of the object at 550 miles per hour, and not 60 knots as was given in the original report from this section. According to the report from the interceptor pilots, they increased their speed in order to close in on the object. The controller records that the object maintained its distance from the interceptor aircraft. Therefore, it is estimated that the object increased its speed as the speed of the interceptor aircraft increased.

c. The operators were unable to measure the acceleration of the object.

d. The unidentified object and the pursuing F-94B appeared simultaneously on the GCI scope. The time and duration are not available.

e. The other two F-94B aircraft which were in the area were not on the GCI scope at this time. No other information on these aircraft is available.

f. The radar observer in the pursuing F-94B obtained the thirty (30) mile look-on at a location approximately twenty (20) miles due west of Port Huron, Michigan, at 0340 (zebra) hours. The other two F-94B aircraft were intercepting (GCI vectored) aircraft.

g. The pilot and the radar observer of the pursuing F-94B aircraft were able to observe the object visually for a period of approximately twenty (20) minutes, commencing at 0240 (zebra) hours. The location was approximately twenty (20) miles due West of Port Huron, Michigan.

h. Base weather reports that the weather balloon which is regularly scheduled for release at 0300 (zebra) hours was released at approximately 0300 hours on 29 July 1952. This balloon was of the approximate type. In the event of a failure in the balloon, it takes an estimated one-half hour to prepare another one. It is believed that on 29 July, the balloon was released as scheduled. The truck was in an eastwardly direction. A man enclosure showing the track of the weather balloon was made by the Base Weather Office.
