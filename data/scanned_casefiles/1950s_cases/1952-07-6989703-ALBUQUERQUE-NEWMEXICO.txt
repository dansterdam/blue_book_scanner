The image contains a diagram that appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The diagram shows the path of an object or objects, with a curved line and a compass rose indicating the direction of travel. There is also a sketch that appears to show the motion of the object or objects during the course of the sighting.

Text from the document:

37. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object(s) appeared when you first saw them. Place a "B" on the same line to show how high the object(s) appeared when they were closest to you (directly overhead). Place a "C" on the line to show how high the object(s) appeared just before they disappeared from view.

38. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE at first, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how many were observed, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.

Text extracted from the document:

This is a further follow up on the information I have written on page 6 part 32. As the object accelerated to the westwards it seemed to rotate and accelerated to a jerk like shifting. First then there was a flash, then it was gone. Also the object was sharply defined, as if it was slightly luminous. It seemed slightly transparent like its impression as the dark. I will never forget as long as I have seen anything like it before.

Out was facing North. The object arched downwards and seemed to proceed jerkily to a point where I thought it was a comet but as it got closer I could see it was a light - an indefinite shape but not cigar or saucer shape, just an irregular light that increased and diminished like a pulsation. At first I thought it might be a plane but the light wasn't steady and it wasn't going straight. It seemed like a bright object in the air, unusually bright and unusual in movement.
33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Not reported until now.

MDT, 27 July 1952 on the mesa behind the University of New Mexico, Mr. SCHULZ, a physics instructor and the undersigned were definitely of the opinion that we saw a bright object in the sky which displayed the following characteristics: (1) It was round in shape and approximately 30 feet in diameter. (2) It was brilliantly lighted and seemed to be of a reddish-orange color. (3) It was completely silent in its flight. (4) It made a steep climb from behind the mesa and traveled in a horizontal course for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, at which time it made a steep dive back of the mesa. (5) During the entire observed flight, the object maintained a constant speed and altitude. (6) Approximately 15 minutes later we again observed the object making a second appearance, this time from behind the mountains to the west of the city. It again made a steep climb, traveled in a horizontal course for about 5 minutes and then made a steep dive back of the mountains. This occurred at approximately 11:00 P.M. MDT, 27 July 1952.

Transcribing the text from the document:

HEADQUARTERS FAGED MAT'S, KIRTLAND
AFB, IM.

OBSERVER: Lt USN

OBJECT OBSERVED: A 17:44Z 6 seconds direct observation through my telescope of a bright silvery object that seemed to be about twice the size of the moon. The object was observed directly overhead, about 65 degrees azimuth. It appeared to be a balloon or a plane, moving in a steady and level flight. It left no trail and made no sound. I studied the object for the full 6 seconds of its visibility and it appeared to be a silvery, round or elliptical object, sharply defined at the edges, and reflecting a bright silvery light. After about 6 seconds it disappeared abruptly, apparently straight up.

COMMENT: This case appears to be one of a conventional aircraft rather than a UFO: the object was observed to be steady and level in flight, with no unusual maneuvers or characteristics, and was visible for a relatively long period of time (6 seconds). The observer's initial impression that it might be a balloon or a plane seems likely to be correct. No further investigation appears warranted.

Another non-rated officer stated that four of these objects were picked up and tracked, and they showed on the scope, but suddenly became obscured and apparently gained an enormous speed and climbed at a fantastic rate. I sighted another one at 1625 MST coming from the southwest and departed it was only in sight for four or five seconds. Then there were two others that came over with paths different and shapes that were circular and one that came over as it disappeared I thought it was some sort of satellite as it was changing and spinning rapidly. The course that were is unusual as they were zig-zagging at high speed and sometime hovered and set a sound, The other two followed a more erratic course and seemed to disappear and then reappear, both at a great speed.

This incident was called to the attention of the Squadron Commander and he was notified about it. I had made no previous reports on sightings in this area before, and no other sightings have been made since. 

Captain - - - - 2-733 Quartermaster Corps stated after the above incident, the objects were also picked up on radar at the Radar Station.

"M/Sgt XXXXXX, Kelly AFB, Texas R-472-95
170lst Air Transport Group
It was approximately 1520 LT, 9 July 1952, and I was in the Transport Control Center about to go on duty 'PLAN 11,' stating that flying saucers' were sighted over Seattle, Washington at approximately 1515 EST. Several members of my crew, including myself, went outside and saw 8 to 10 objects maneuvering over Albuquerque, N.M. They were light gray in color, smooth on the surface with no protrusions. They moved in a diagonal and circular pattern and occasionally stopped and hovered. I walked out the front door of the Control Section at approximately 1530 LT and sighted these objects further west and higher in the sky. As I watched them they started to descend slowly and I continued to watch them until they disappeared from sight into the distant haze.

Lt. XXXXX, at approximately 1500 MST, heard over the long line telephone that flying objects had been sighted in the general locality. He informed certain personnel of this fact and at the rate of speed that they had been previously determined to have, of over 600 mph and one-half to two minutes, so several of the people in the locality decided they would take a look and took binoculars and saw two objects in the next few minutes, and they were circular and smooth and no protrusions and moved very rapidly and then disappeared. I don't know which direction they were headed, but they were gone for good.

MRS. XXXXX, (Civilian Employee)
I, Mrs. XXXXX, was in the office and Mrs. XXXXX was in there talking to me when I heard Mrs. XXXXX say, 'Have you seen those flying saucers?' and she took Mrs. XXXXX to the window to look out and they both saw two objects which they said were flying saucers. They appeared to be light gray in color and moving very rapidly in a straight course and they saw them for only about 15 seconds and then they disappeared from sight."

A little background of this incident will clarify the statement that I and Capt have previously made. So, when we looked at these two objects come across the sky, they first attracted our attention as they were flying in an unnatural path. How did they know to take off? 
The statements below show that there was some transmissions over the squawk box that flying saucers? The statements show that they did not have time to take pictures because the speed of these objects were so great that they took off and were gone so fast. As soon as the objects had disappeared, I came into the traffic office and called the on duty Intelligence Officer and was asked several questions regarding the incident and the direction of the objects and also their apparent altitude which these objects were flying.

On the afternoon of 5 July 1952 approximately 1545 hours, I observed a circular object traversing the sky at a high rate of speed. This object was estimated to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and appeared to be metallic in structure. They moved with extreme maneuverability. They appeared to travel from the west to the east and then to the southeast. They were silent and no trail or exhaust was visible. One larger object appeared, and a pulsating glow was observed to emanate from it. I have heretofore been very careful as to any findings as to the causers or anything of that nature.

At one time I saw one in a tank and saw a metallic flash. On this particular date, they would abruptly disappear, except for a few seconds, and then reappear, traveling at extremely high speeds. They seemed to come from the west and to the east and southeast. The direction of the disappearance of these objects appeared to be from the west and to the east and southeast.

On 29 July 1952 at about 9:15 PM, an employee of the Ground Observer Corps at the Kirtland Air Force Base reported observing an unidentified object in the sky. The object was described as round in shape and appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. It was first observed at about 9:00 PM and was seen for approximately 15 minutes. The witness stated that the object appeared to be hovering at an altitude estimated to be between 2,000 and 5,000 feet. The object then began moving at a rapid rate of speed first to the east, then to the southwest, and then back to the east, according to the witness. The object emitted a bright light and was described as being a silvery or aluminum color. There were no wings or means of propulsion visible, and no sound was heard. The witness reported that the object's movements were very fast and erratic. Four other employees of the Ground Observer Corps also observed the object and confirmed the witness' account. However, the actual size and distance to the object could not be determined. The object was lost from view as it moved away to the east. No explanation for the sighting could be determined.

At approximately 1430, while section where I noticed a group of people looking in front of the hanger, I observed an object that was round and similar to a weather balloon climbing or flying at that altitude. I observed one at a 45 degree angle slightly west and it seemed to be crawling or creeping back and forth like a pendulum and it seemed that one side or lower object was uneven or irregular than the other side, and it would come back and disappear, and would come back and disappear again, and only one side was reflecting the light that I could make out. After the third disappearance the object appeared to the northeast, and moved across the horizon and seemed to be at a great (obscured at about 5-6 degree angle) a similar object appeared and moved across the horizon and passed close to the other two objects. After that third disappearance the object vanished to the northwest, the other two objects continued to work.

I. T----- was standing out in front of the hangar and observed a light approximately 1605 1/2 stop and come out of the traffic section right in front of the hangar and immediately noticed people moving into the area. I pointed this object out to the pilots when I first noticed it, and then I got a better look at it. It was about the size of a C-45, but the way it was moving and maneuvering I would say it was very high and tremendous in size. I saw it again a second later, it was going in a semi-erratic direction and then I lost sight of it. I cannot determine exactly the height, but I would say it was very high and tremendous in size. The object had a very bright light, it was the size of a basketball and it was terrific. I saw a second object, it was smaller, but it was going also very fast and in an erratic direction. I could not make out if it was round or not, but it was moving erratically and very high and very fast. It was like a ball of fire and was reflecting off the object. I am certain that the object I saw was neither a weather balloon nor an airplane, and I am satisfied that what I saw was definitely the first case which I know was not a weather balloon and not an airplane.

I was standing out in front of the hangar and approximately 1605 1/2 UTC some object came up and was hovering over the hangar. It was at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet, stationary at first and when I first saw them they looked like they were going around and around and gave off a white glow once in a while. In my opinion of what I saw, they were like a as seemed to me that one flipped its side and I observed that motion. The object was about an 30 degree angle.

I was in our office around 1530 when one of the boys came in and asked if I had seen 7----- telling him that he was 'doing something up there'. I did not believe what he was telling me, so I just stayed in the office. The only thing that I observed was when the object or whatever it was went by the office window, I did not see anything and then it seemed to disappear. I did not pay any attention to it and I was just sitting here and started looking up into the sky. I first saw the object just for a second and then it disappeared and I did not see anything else.

was informed that several citizens sighted strange objects in the air at approximately 1415 MST, as they were rising vertically. A man stated that he saw 6 or 7 round objects silver in color, ascending and was unable to account for them. He said they were sighted to the southwest and appeared to be about 1,000 feet in the air. The objects stopped and hovered, then climbed rapidly out of sight.

I, Mrs. [ redacted ], was at home eight miles from the Grant Falls AFB when my husband, who was on duty at the Base, called me to tell me to look for strange objects in the sky. I went outside and looked to the north and saw five bright objects in the sky which appeared to be about 10,000 feet in the air and moving very rapidly. They were oblong in shape and silver in color. A sixteen year old boy was with me and he can confirm this statement as to the color and behavior of the objects.

The last two were traveling north to south in the western part of the sky. They seemed to be a vapor-trail them and behaved like jet airplanes. Due to the brightness of the sun, I was unable to get a clear view in the binoculars. All three seemed to disappear just I managed to travel out of sight.

17 Sist Air Traffic Sq

Space Control office at approximately 1220 EWT 29 July 1952 in the vicinity of Sandia Base. Two flying discs were observed at approximately 1250 EWT hovering over the Sandia Base area. The objects were identified in the vicinity of Sandia Base for about two minutes and then gained speed and climbed at a high rate of speed and disappeared. The objects were oblong in shape and were visible to the naked eye. The control tower also observed them and made a written record of the sighting. They advised and alerted the information to the 3520th Air Base Group who came to the control tower and also saw the objects. Two stationary objects were about 1500 feet in the air. The third object hovered and descended in a matter of four seconds. The other two followed and disappeared in the east. 

I sighted another one at 1225 EST coming from the northwest and disappearing to the southeast. It appeared to be about the size of a small aircraft and was visible for about 30 seconds. There appeared to be a blue-green glow emanating from the exterior. The glow was suddenly extinguished and the object disappeared, leaving no trail. 

The written record I have which I gave the Air Force investigator can be supplied is limited and I would suggest contacting the 17th Air Traffic Squadron for more complete details on these sightings.

Then at approximately 2345 MST the Associated Press reporter told me that be had a telephone call from some town in New Mexico, stating a man had reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the Albuquerque area. He said the AP had contacted the base and asked if we had any information or reports of objects over Albuquerque. I then told the AP representative that we had no reports of objects over Albuquerque, and that I personally had not observed any such objects.

1701st Air Transport Group

On 29 July 1952, as I was in the Transport Control Office, I observed a group of officers looking out the window at 3:55 p.m. as they were transmission over the PLAN IIIC, stating that "flying saucers" were sighted toward the west. Immediately, I and several others went to the windows and observed several objects, round in shape, gray in color, and very high in the sky. They were immediately out of sight and headed towards the west. They appeared to be very high and very fast, much faster than any jet planes we have today. We all watched in amazement and disbelief as they disappeared from sight. Later on that evening, there was a large gathering of all the officers discussing this incident and there seemed to be only one opinion, that what we saw was not an optical illusion or any known type of aircraft. The project officer of the Control Section said that similar reports had been made at 1925, 1:55, and looked into the route, speed, and heading of these objects. He stated that the control tower had merely observed and vectored the objects off of the screen, and as per regulations, had submitted a report to higher headquarters. The information I have given is what I personally observed and what was discussed by the officers present.

Lt. USAF Air Traffic Squadron
I. Lt. USAF as approximately 1500 MST heard over the long line telephone the first report from a ground observer concerning a bright light that was over the area of Albuquerque, New Mexico. All is a report by a Jerald Baker, who was on the field observing with his station wagon light that was to be checked - a spot light on checking the car and a white light that the observer has shown down on the ground, and when the observer looked up he saw an extremely bright light at about the same rate of the station wagon light that was down on the ground. The observer immediately went on the phone to report this to the Control Tower at Kirtland Air Force Base. The observer examined the light for a period of approximately 2 or 3 minutes. The light remained stationary and did not move. At the end of 2 or 3 minutes the light suddenly went out. The light at the time of disappearance was as bright as the station wagon light that the observer had on the ground, and the observer stated that the sky was exceptionally clear. I went out myself and my car I was within the next few minutes. They had no apparent depth as far as I could tell. One appeared as though it were in front of me and one appeared as though it were behind me, but I could not actually determine the depth, so I'm not quite sure whether the appeared in front of me or behind me as I looked at them. They just appeared as lights and the way I saw it was as though they were stationary and the car that I was in was moving between them. The lights had no apparent size - they were just small points of light and did not appear to change in size or shape while I observed them. They were there for a very short period of time and then suddenly disappeared.

Some people saw moving lights in the area a few seconds, the same as we observed, it lasted about 5 seconds. The small smoke round the houses a little way off. They were there probably 15 seconds or longer. I saw about four objects. They moved very fast, as I first saw them they were a light and would appear again. It gave the impression of being a large light, as it would appear and disappear again. It was around 1900 but I cannot say for sure. It was well dark at the time. One of the objects above tower took off to my left at a terrific rate of speed and left a while streak in the sky, probably was the object's exhaust. People in the office were Lt. ---- S/Sgt. ---- and Mrs. -----.

1701's Air Traffic Rpt 
that a little background of this incident will clarify the statements 
made to be later. The question was asked: "Did they 
see any "flying discs"? The statement was made that
they did not see any "flying discs" on this occasion.
I will state that the flying objects which they did see were 
nothing like the common conception of the "flying discs" 
we hear so much about. The appearance of these objects
was quite different from the circular or disc shaped objects
which we are accustomed to think of as "flying discs". 
At 1835 Ms I was outside the hangar looking in the direction 
of so degree elevation and approximately 40 degrees to the right
of the main hangar (approx azimuth 280 degrees). The objects appeared 
to be at an altitude of about 2000 feet and were traveling in a 
generally southerly direction at an estimated speed of 200-300 mph. 
The appearance of the objects did not resemble the size or shape 
of conventional aircraft. They were a very bright, silvery color and 
apparently saucer or disc shaped. At times they appeared to be 
bright and circular, and at other times elongated or elliptical 
in shape. I watched them for approximately 2-3 minutes as they 
disappeared into the distance to the south.
Besides the date I was relating there, objects I regularly
sighted during the past two months. This time they came as 
a complete surprise. All of a sudden they were there and
then in a matter of seconds they had disappeared into 
the distance. The Air Intelligence was asked to come
and I was informed there was no one checking.

171st Air Transport Group
23 July 1952, at approximately 2545 MST, a crew on a training flight over Albuquerque, New Mexico, observed several metallic objects in the air. The objects were dull and silvery in color and appeared to be maneuvering. They were estimated to be 25,000 to 30,000 feet in altitude. The objects were in sight for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. One object peeled off from the main group and accelerated rapidly, disappearing from sight. The other objects maintained a relatively uniform course and speed. I have borrowed and attached the original of this report. If you should have any flying saucers or anything of that nature, I would appreciate it if you would return them to me by return mail. I saw one in a bank and saw a metallic flash. On subsequent observation, the object appeared to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter and the ground visibility was very poor. I am sure of the diameter, as I had the object in sight for a considerable length of time and I saw it maneuver. It appeared to be a metallic, disc-shaped object, and the sky cover was such that I had an excellent view. I am sure of the sighting and something must have been in the sky at that time. I saw approximately 3 or 4 of these objects.

1701st Air Transport Gp
Upon reporting for duty 1530 hours 6 July 1952 it was reported that they saw 20
flying objects. This was in the vicinity of Albuquerque, N. M. There were 
apparently multiple groups of 4 or 5 of these objects observed over a period of 20 
minutes by the control tower operators and the crew. The objects were described as 
round or cigar shaped and silent, they were also observed to move at great speed 
and make sharp turns and maneuvers. The control tower and crew have stated that 
they do not believe they were aircraft. It is reported that similar objects referred to 
as saucers were spotted.
After watching apparent aerial maneuvers for about five (5) minutes, I was able to 
pick up one of these objects. It appeared to be round or disc shaped, and was 
moving at a very high rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 500 m.p.h. After 
viewing this object for about two (2) minutes, it suddenly turned due north and 
appeared to accelerate rapidly, going out of sight within a matter of seconds.
Due to the 50 m.p.h. wind and the apparent high rate of speed I estimate their 
speed to be between 500 and 600 m.p.h. I was unable to determine their size, shape, 
or number, however, the crew describing their description as to their shape, other 
than round, is consistent with my observation.

It will only stay visible for a short period, say approx. 15 degree angle looking to the south and its movement was very slow and forth like a pendulum and it made a dip on each side as it swung back and forth. The object was silent and was about twice the size of a lower object and was a very brilliant light but not as bright as the sun come lines view to the west but not in the direction of the object and the object seemed to have a rotary motion though it was hard to tell exactly what the motion was. After about a minute or two the object became invisible to me and without further observation I returned to my normal duties.

Jet was first observed about 1430. The object was traveling East. They looked like a white flare and were intermittently visible. They looked about 5,000 to 7,000 feet altitude. The object was motionless, then moved slowly and then took off at a high rate of speed. I saw several.

I, the undersigned, a member of the Security Squad of the 1702d Air Transport Wing, certify the following: 
I found out that the object which I reported sighting at approximately 2235 hours on November 29, 1952, was actually a plate. I found this out upon closer examination of the object. When I first looked at it, it appeared to be some type of aircraft traveling at a high rate of speed. However, upon examining it closer, I discovered that it was merely a plate reflecting light, rather than an aircraft. This plate was reflecting light in such a manner that it gave the impression of an object traveling at a high rate of speed. Therefore, the sighting which I reported was simply a reflection of light on a plate, rather than any type of unidentified aerial object.

I, [name redacted], was in one office around 1530 when one of the boys came in and asked if I had seen the strange saucers that I told him. I did not believe what he was telling me, as I was just kidding, I did not believe what I was telling him, so the boys went out to investigate. I then told them that I had no idea, that I was just fooling them,  When I got back to my office, I called H. [name redacted] and asked if he had seen anything. He said no, that he had not seen anything either. I then told him that I had told the boys that I had seen something, but that I was just fooling them.

At approximately 1620 MST two objects came in and we went out to look at them. They were fuzzy and seemed to be adjustable to the tower and it was the same size and distance as the first one. One could not watch constantly, as my eyes would get blurry.

I, N.W. Grant, was at home sight miles from the Grant Falls, being on duty at the B. of L. F. & E. office in Great Falls, Montana, when my attention was attracted to what appeared to me to be a formation of objects, maneuvering in the sky above the Grant Falls. These objects appeared to be round, and varying in size from approximately 25 to 50 feet in diameter. They seemed to be traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and were bobbing, weaving, and darting back and forth. The objects were observed for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes, before they disappeared from sight.

The lights two were reddish in color, and appeared to be pulsating. All three seemed to disappear, just seemed to travel out of sight.

SUBJECT: Memorandum of Facts Concerning Unidentified Objects Sighted in the Great Falls, Montana Area on 29 July 1952.

1. Tuesday, 29 July 1952, at approximately 12:50 hours, MST FOUR (4) unidentified objects were sighted over Great Falls, Montana. USAF OFFICERS reported that these objects were traveling very fast, silently and in an irregular pattern. They saw for three (3) to four (4) minutes. The objects appeared to be metallic and elliptical in shape and ranged in size from 30 to 40 feet in diameter. All objects were reported to have been traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 miles per hour. The objects were estimated to be 10,000 to 12,000 feet in altitude. All objects were observed to be traveling in a straight line and at times made abrupt changes in direction. The OFFICERS were able to track these objects on the RADAR equipment at the Base. At one point the objects were estimated to be 50,000 feet in altitude. 

2. These flying objects were observed from the Seattle, Washington area (General Chidlaw) and the Plan 62 Video Circuit was activated. This circuit is designed to provide instantaneous visual contact on any unusual flying objects. However, the objects disappeared from view before the visual contact could be made.

3. At 12:00 hours MST Thursday, 31 July 1952, the local radio station received a phone call from a private individual who reported seeing similar flying objects over Great Falls, Montana at approximately 22:00 hours on 29 July 1952. The objects were sighted for several minutes and the individual was able to observe the performance characteristics reported above. As informed, the radio station KMON made an announcement of the radio sighting ASAP. The Commanding Officer was immediately informed of this incident.

STATEMENT OF WITNESS

Major ---------, Mont.

On 27 July 52, I was returning with my family from a being trip and had stopped at the side of the road to fill the car with gasoline. It was approximately between 1400 and 1500 hours MST. As I was putting gasoline in the car, I noticed a dark colored object hovering over a nearby mountain. This object appeared to be about the size of my fist held at arm's length. It was smooth and round and seemed to be stationary in the sky. I did not see the object take off or land. After filling the car with gasoline, we continued on our way. The object remained stationary while we were there and I watched it for about 3 to 5 minutes before we drove off. I had an eight-power binocular when I was watching the object and it appeared to be metallic and reflecting the sun's rays. There was no sound or trail of any kind associated with the object. 

I stopped to check on a car from Arkansas and one from Ohio. The man in the Arkansas car had stopped and was also watching the object through binoculars. I think the man from Ohio also saw the object, but he did not stop. Shortly after I left, the object made a very fast, vertical ascent and disappeared into a white cloud.

During this time, I took several moving pictures with an Eighth Bell and Howell movie camera. Upon developing the film, the object was visible in several frames, but very small and indistinct. Upon showing the film to Major ------, he was unable to identify the object.

I have flown in excess of ______ hours in the Air Corps, and have never seen anything like this object before. There was no sound, trail or other characteristics which would identify it as a known aircraft. I am unable to estimate its size or distance, but it appeared about the size of my fist held at arm's length.

I wish to state that I am in the Army Corps of Engineers and was stationed with the 7th Division, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Maj J. M. Penny, USAF
Stated the observation with operations from Great Falls AFB on 29 July 1952.

Committed in accordance with AF LR No. 200-5, dated 20 April, 1952. Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects.

Between the hours of 1400 and 1500 MST, 29 July 1952, from four (4) to nine (9) female observers, employees of a local radio-television station in Great Falls, Montana, saw three (3) white or light-colored, approximately disc-shaped objects traveling about 600 knots at an altitude of approximately 15,000 to 20,000 feet. The objects appeared to be powered by jet propulsion and were smooth-surfaced, with no projections or appendages. The objects maneuvered at high speed, made sharp turns, and other unidentified maneuvers.

The first observed there were one indefinitely shaped object, pear-shaped, dark-colored, and smaller than the later observed objects. This object disappeared behind a hill. Three (3) larger, disc-shaped objects then appeared, flying one behind the other at different angles and speeds. These (3) objects flew out of the cloud, circled, and returned to central point behind cloud. After a short time, two (2) other similar objects appeared from the same cloud, following the three (3) objects.

From 30 minutes to one hour later, another cloud suddenly appeared over a mountain area, some 20 miles distant, and three (3) similar objects emerged from this cloud and returned to it.

(*) For a more detailed report, see IR 474-52, prepared by Lt Col K.A.S. CATY, INTEL DIVISION, WASHINGTON, D.C., dated 4 August 1952.

Time of observations: 30 minutes. Weather conditions: not reported.

Observers have excellent reputation but no technical training. Two civilian female employees of a local radio-television station, a member of the local police force, and other unidentified persons.

This object was 12:03 with a strange blinking light at the front traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. This object was approximately 4 miles off distance and bright enough to blind the initial observer momentarily. These objects appeared to be approximately 60 to 90 feet in diameter and were observed by many reliable witnesses, pilots, and control tower operators.

The text in the document describes a sighting of unidentified aerial objects by the witness on July 29. The document mentions details such as the objects' appearance, movements, and the witness's observations.

Transcribed text from the document:

Great Falls, Montana

I was returning with my family from a fishing trip in Idaho. We had just heard a news broadcast on the radio that a "flying saucer" had been sighted over Great Falls, Montana, at about 10:50 PM on July 29.

As I was driving along the highway, I suddenly noticed three brightly lit objects in the western sky. I called the attention of my family to them. We watched them for about 15 minutes. They appeared to be circular in shape and about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. They were traveling in a diagonal line from northwest to southeast at a terrific speed and darted back and forth in an erratic manner. As they traveled, they would suddenly appear to dart or zig-zag at a tremendous rate of speed, then slow down, hover, and dart off again in a different direction. They were so bright that they illuminated the countryside below them. The objects would disappear and reappear at different places in the sky. At one time they seemed to merge into one large object, then separate again into three smaller objects.

I stopped the car and we all got out to watch them better. The three objects continued their maneuvers for about 15 minutes, then suddenly the three objects left the sky at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight.

After this incident, I wish to add that I am a "Major in the Air Force, A-2 Clearance 1945 to 1946" while stationed with X Division, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency): OSI, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico

DATE OF INFORMATION: 22 JULY 1952

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

In accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 12 AUGUST 1949, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects, a report is submitted.

On 22 JULY 1952, between 1, 000 and 1, 030 hours, MST, two towers at the Albuquerque Airport reported the presence of strange lights in the air southwest of the airport, moving in a north-southerly direction. The control tower operator reported seeing at least 8-12 fast moving lights at one time, some turning red, some white, and some green. He stated they seemed to move rapidly, stopping and starting, ascending and descending. The Air Force radar operator on duty reported that he had observed the object on his scope, but that it seemed to move too fast for normal aircraft. The lights were observed by many witnesses, both Air Force and civilian. They were from 500 to 5,000 feet in altitude and seemed to hover and make rather erratic maneuvers. After about a half hour the lights disappeared from view and from the radar scope. No aircraft were in the area. This report is considered as being reliable, as the observers were well qualified.

SWORN STATEMENT

I, a pilot employed by Zin Air Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statements:

On July 29, 1952, at approximately 1043 A.M. a group of five persons and myself out south near the Los Alamos, New Mexico. We were talking about something when I and all of us called attention to an object which appeared to be silver and disk-shaped. It was traveling in a southwesterly direction.

Personally, I observed the object for approximately four or five seconds. Its altitude was visible to pick the object up against looking back toward high tension power lines. It was at least 20,000 feet and moving at least 500 M.P.H.

The sky was clear and the wind on the ground was north at five to 10 M.P.H. The object was clearly visible and appeared to be round in shape.

On July 29th I was first and seen of the witnesses (or at least called to the place by the neighbors) to an unidentified flying object which was hovering over a residence, and we were pointing them out and two small children when they first came into view. It was a very large object, generally what to be called saucer-shaped, I just saw it hover over the door when it came. But, said he lock those of him so I stooped the vapor trails and last object to view the vapor trails and last on the ground and to saw vapor trails.

It was a greyish color, and did a double waving motion and then was obscured by the trees below, but it came to above the trees and then disappeared below the trees and left "no visible smoke or vapor trails. It is possible that it was a jet that was flying around and came suddenly. 

I couldn't tell the shape. It was just an object and was shiny and looked about the size of a jet.

Station, Los Alamos, New Mexico, do report the following:
On July 29 at approximately 10 a.m., MST, I was down in the canyon.
As I was definitely make out any object other than a spot color, some clouded, I estimated this to be approximately 50 to 200 yards from me and at an elevation of approximately 150 to 200 feet. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and seemed to be dark grey or black in color. It was approximately the size of a small car. It was stationary for approximately 2 to 3 minutes and then started to move in a westerly direction at a very high rate of speed and disappeared behind the mountain.
The weather was clear and visibility was excellent. I could see distinctly for several miles. I did not hear any sound or see any smoke or vapor trail.
I have had considerable experience in observing aircraft and this was definitely not any type of aircraft or helicopter that I have ever seen. It is my considered opinion that this was a flying object of some kind and that I have never seen anything like it before.
In comparison to the size of the jet it was approximately the size of a small car. There were no appendages, wings, tail or protrusions that I could make out.
I would like to add that the jet which was moving observed shortly after the flying object was between 15,000 and 20,000 feet.

Text transcription from the document:

I, (name redacted), do hereby make the following statement:

On the 29th of July, at approximately 1045 MST, in company with the Los Alamos Airport. I sighted an object, which I estimate was between 40,000 to 50,000 feet in the air over Los Alamos, N.M. The object was whitish in color. I observed it for 5 or 6 seconds with the naked eye. Then, I started to pick it up with binoculars, but it disappeared from sight. To compare it to something known, it would appear to be about the size of a DC-6, traveling at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour. The sky was clear and the object appeared to be traveling in a southwesterly direction.

THE NATURE OF THE INCIDENT OBSERVED WAS VERY SHORT-LIVED AND QUITE UNUSUAL. IT APPEARED AS A VERY BRIGHT SILVERY DISCLIKE OBJECT WHICH FLEW DIRECTLY ACROSS THE TOWER IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION. IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HALF DOLLAR HELD AT ARMS LENGTH AND SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY SILENT. IT APPEARED VERY SUDDENLY AND DISAPPEARED EQUALLY AS SUDDENLY, ONLY BEING VISIBLE FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR SECONDS.

I SAW IT JUST FOR A FEW SECONDS. IT WAS A DISTINCT GLOW IN THE SKY. THOUGH IT WAS NOT QUITE STATIONARY, IT WAS NOT IN POWERED FLIGHT BUT APPEARED TO BE GLIDING. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

The distance of the object could not be determined. The object appeared egg-shaped and dark in color. Considered the size of a large commercial aircraft. The object moved rapidly and disappeared from view in an easterly direction behind Bald Mountain. The time sighted behind Bald Mountain was uncertain because of the determined location due to the distance. The size of the object could not be determined because of the distance."

3. The following was reported by telephone installer at Los Alamos, New Mexico:
"At 1057 hours (MST), 29 July 1952, at the Security Station G-10, I observed an object appearing egg-shaped in structure, directly overhead. The distance I was unable to determine, but when first sighted and appeared to have wings. The object continued this oscillating or gyrating motion to descending motion as it began to move, then the wings disappeared. The object had no color and appeared light brown in color as it began to move. The object then disappeared from view. I was unable to determine whether the object disappeared behind the horizon, or simply blinked out."

Transcribing the text from the document:

I saw it at approximately 11:00 PM on 29 July. It was observed from the ground and remained visible for approximately 20 minutes. The object was first sighted as a bright light in the western sky, which gradually became larger and more distinct. It appeared to be a disc or saucer-shaped object, much larger than a star or planet, and was aluminum or silver in color. It emitted no sound and made no trail or exhaust. The object hovered for some time, then moved erratically, darting around and occasionally stopping, then moving off rapidly toward the west and disappearing from sight. At times it appeared to tilt at an angle, revealing a distinct saucer or disc-like shape as it turned. The edges were well defined and there appeared to be a row of what seemed to be portholes or lights around the exterior.

AIR SERVICES
It is hereby certified that the following statement is true. I was on the southern outskirts of Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the time indicated. I saw a light in the sky which at first appeared to be a very small, bright star. The color was a whitish-yellow, and it seemed to have a dim reddish hue. There was no aerial trail or vapor or anything of that nature which would indicate an aircraft. It was at a very high altitude. The object was in view for approximately 1 minute to 1 1/2 minutes and did not seem to change either in size or color during this period. There was no sound. The object then disappeared from view, not because it went below the horizon but because it seemed to simply vanish. I have between ten and twelve thousand hours in the air, and am quite familiar with aircraft of all types, including jet aircraft. I have no idea what this object was, but I am certain it was not an aircraft of any kind.

STATEMENT OF WITNESSES

I had heard over the radio that objects had been spotted in Cuba, so we were looking up toward the north all the time. About 10:30 it was going from NE to SW. Then I started seeing them about every 15 minutes. They were going quite slow and would stop every little space in between. At first they were going from the southwest to the northeast, but after a little while they started going from the northeast to the southwest. We could see them much longer than we could the stars. You could see them disappear when I saw them last, they didn't look as big as the last ones.

As I saw them, they were bright white. The reason I didn't think they were stars was that they were not twinkling. They seemed to come nearer instead of going far away. They others didn't notice them until I pointed them out.

REMARKS:
The assistant astronomer of West Palm Beach, Florida, expressed the opinion that the objects referred to above were meteors.

STATEMENT OF xxxxxx ADDRESDD:
PLACE OF SIGHTING: West Palm Beach, Fla. 
TIME OF SIGHTING: 2:30 P.M., 25 July 1952

I had just about the object that objects had been sited in other areas, we were looking for them. It was quite similar to I saw them after a while. About 10 to 12 very gole from my to SE. They appeared to be about 20 to 25 feet in diameter. Some of them seemed to be a little larger than the others. At first I thought they were airplanes, but after observing them for a while I was quite sure that they were not. The things were a silver-white color, and had a rather high rate of speed. They did not seem to be as large as aircraft, and they did not give off any sort of smoke-trail. They appeared to be skimming along a couple of hundred feet off the ground at a very high rate of speed. When I first saw them they seemed to be going from NW to SE. When I last saw them they seemed to be going from W to E. I estimate that they were in sight for around 2 or 3 minutes. As soon as I saw them I called my wife to come and see them, but before she got out they seemed to have disappeared. At no time did I see any sign of their slowing down or stopping. As a matter of fact, when I last saw them they were still going at a high rate of speed. They did not zig-zag or make any other erratic motions, but just kept going in a straight line. I am quite sure they were not airplanes, jets, or any other known type of aircraft.

STATION OF ADDRESS OF PERSONS
FILING REPORT: West Palm Beach, Fla.
DATE OF SIGHTING: 28 July 1952

I came in about 10:30 and they were standing in the patio watching the TV show. They said that to be some lights streaking in the sky. I went out to look and they were right, there were about 15 lights in the sky in a straight line, they would disappear one at a time and another would appear a little distance to the other side, they would do this for about 15 mins. The lights were round and white and about the size of a dime at arms length, they were not blinking just steady white lights. They seemed to be going about the speed of an airplane and were at about the same altitude. I have no idea what they could have been, I have never seen anything like it before. After watching for about 15 mins they all disappeared at once. One rather odd thing that I noticed was that a couple of my neighbors had also come out to watch, we stood there in silence watching in amazement. I called the sheriff's office after they disappeared but they said they had had several calls about them and there was nothing they could do. I would be very interested in knowing what these lights were that we saw. I have a very suspicious mind and I'm wondering if it could have been some kind of new aircraft the government is experimenting with, or could it have been something from outer space? I would appreciate any information you could give me on this.

All I can say is that the objects I saw were unusual. They seemed to be lights of some kind. I didn't think they were aircraft at the time, and I still don't think they were aircraft. Some had balls of light, some of them had definite shapes. I can't tell you more than I've already said. I know you have to be skeptical, but I saw these things and they were not like anything I've seen before. The whole thing is a mystery to me as much as it is to you.

T/Sgt. T.W. Fusmire, Weather Observer, Walker AFB
1. Between 0820 and 0940 on 29 July 1952 four weather observers, including Lt. Walker AFB observed a number of unidentified flying objects.
2. It was not possible to determine the altitude of the unidentified objects, but it is known that they were higher than a weather balloon which was under observation at 20,000 feet.
3. The objects were described as metallic in color.
4. Size of the objects could not be determined, but they appeared smaller than the weather balloons, which showed a diameter of approximately 6 feet at 20,000 feet.
5. Erratic and highly maneuverable flight characteristics were displayed, requiring rotating the theodolite at maximum rate in order to track them.
6. The unusual speed of the objects was NE to SW, or WNE to WSW, but two objects reversed course.
7. The scientific experience of the weather personnel making these observations, indicates as actual experience of unidentified flying objects.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
66th Bomb Wing, Heavy
1952-07-27-52

The report describes an incident where two or more metallic objects were observed in the sky near Albuquerque, New Mexico. The objects were described as being metallic in color, resembling a grain of wheat in shape, and were determined to be beyond the weather balloon under observation. The observers were unable to estimate the altitude of the objects with any degree of accuracy.

The report also mentions that it was impossible to estimate the size of the objects before the weather balloon burst. The objects were observed to change direction and speed, and to disappear into the distance. The report states that the objects followed a general path from northwest to southeast.

This image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the document is as follows:

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
The object appeared to be very bright, whitish in color and changing in 3-D as it moved. Observers say that it was definitely round and that it was surrounded by a grayish halo or ring. The angular size of the object seemed to be a little larger than that of a star. The object was observed for a period of over an hour and a half. 
DURATION OF OBSERVATION: Object sighted at 12:35 hours. Object in sight approximately 1.5 hours.
METHOD OF OBSERVATION: Visually from the ground. No optical or electronic equipment used.
TIME AND CONDITIONS OF OBSERVATION: Each observer was located at 37Â°38'N - 97Â°26'W. They were watching the object in relation to the adjacent buildings of the Kirtland Air Force Base.
CHARACTERISTICS OF OBJECT(S): The object seemed to be stationary, and at times moved very slowly. Sometimes it seemed to give off a red glow. The object was observed to be at an estimated altitude of 20,000-25,000 feet. The temperature was 88 degrees Fahrenheit, and the wind velocity was 9-12 mph from the southwest.
IDENTIFYING OF OBJECT: According to the observers, the object did not resemble any conventional aircraft or known celestial object. They work near the Municipal Airport Terminal and are thoroughly familiar with all types of aircraft and celestial phenomena which they say should now be apparent. They indicated that the object was unlike anything they had ever seen before.

6th Bomb Wing, Heavy                      17-99-52   PAGE 3 OF 4 

In the first instance, HOLLYWOOD was tracking one object, holding it in the position, and the object was seen to disappear from the scope at point "C" and moved to an inverse bearing, reversed into position "D". Its rate of closure on object "A" was described as "faster than a jet".

In the second instance, SPINA was tracking an object in the position indicated by the diagram. The object appeared to be moving on an approximately the same course, speeding up and slowing down, and moving out of the scope. The object was a dark appearance and the scope indication was it was moving with the speed of the scope, indicating the object was a distance of 20-30 miles. It was not possible to determine whether this was a difference in the relative speed of the object or a difference in the scope presentation.

A total of nine objects were observed during the period 0825 to 0930. However, most of these cases were of a fleeting nature with the objects being detected for a very short period of time, giving only a small proportion of the cases which were in the atmosphere at the time. No identification has been made at this time. There is no indication where these objects came from or where they went to. All that is known about them is that a small proportion of the cases which were in the atmosphere at the time were detected and tracked on the scope.

On 23 MAY 1952, at approximately 1330 MST, a/c (unk), consisting of an unidentified flying object, reporting (characteristic ) "FLYOBJCT", the following report:

On 23 MAY 1952, at approximately 1330 MST, a bright, round, metallic-looking object was observed. It was first noticed about 10 degrees above the horizon, moving in a south-westerly direction. The object appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed. it was considerably faster than any known conventional aircraft. The object changed direction several times and appeared to be maneuvering. The object was observed for approximately 7 or 8 minutes. There was no noise associated with the object. It was about 1/2 the size of a full moon. It then made a sharp, high-speed turn and disappeared from sight.

The image appears to contain a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s. The document appears to be a report about an incident that occurred on July 29, 1952, near Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The text in the document states that on the 29th of July 1952, while conducting training in the local area, a WAF aircraft observed a bright object at an altitude of 30,000 and 40,000 feet. The object was thought to be another aircraft, but after several minutes of observation, it was determined that the object was not a known aircraft and was exhibiting unusual behavior, such as rapidly changing altitude and direction.

The document also mentions that the object was observed for a period of about 2-3 minutes and that it appeared to be losing altitude before it disappeared from view.

OCR Output:

Air Force Office, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On the 29th of July 1952, while conducting training in the WAF area about 1300 hours (M.S.T.), a WAF aircraft observed a bright object at an altitude of 30,000 and 40,000 feet. At first, it was thought that this was another aircraft, but after about 7-8 minutes of very close attention to it, it was decided that this was not a known aircraft and that it was exhibiting peculiar characteristics between an altitude of 30,000 and 40,000 feet. At first, attention was fixed on it for a period of approximately 5 minutes, and it was assumed to be bobbing up and down, and darting here and there, and it appeared to be increasing and decreasing in altitude. While maintaining this position, it was noted that it appeared to be losing altitude, and after a period of about 2-3 minutes and decided to report it to the Command Center (GCI), while watching it to see if it would reappear. When it did not reappear, the WAF aircraft returned to base.

ON 28 July 1952 at approximately 1350 MST, as I was going to the WAV 3asebracket for lunch, I observed a luminous object in the sky. They called my attention to it. They had been watching it for some time. The object appeared to be elliptical in shape and seemed to be emitting a blue-green glow. It remained in the same area for several minutes. The object appeared to be approximately 15,000 to 20,000 feet in altitude and was estimated to be moving at a speed 800 to 1,000 miles per hour. There was no sound associated with it in any manner whatsoever. After I had observed it for a while, it started to descend rapidly, and then, it stopped descending and began to ascend again. It appeared to be oscillating up and down for a while. It suddenly appeared to be surrounded by a white glow and then, it stopped descending and began to ascend again. It seemed to disappear completely in a short time. It disappeared completely.

UFO Matter Reported to D/I, AFOIN-X

The following incident, and action taken as a result thereof, is reported:

a. At approximately 1550 hours Friday, 7 August 1952, this office received a telephone call from Colonel Gilbert V. Hathaway, USAF, who is Chief of the Air Defense Division, Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF.

b. Colonel Hathaway demanded the detailed results and analysis of a "flying saucer" report which had been submitted to this office earlier. This information was, somehow, to be used as part of the briefing he was preparing for a TV presentation.

c. Mr. was informed that we could not release information from our files, and that authority from Headquarters USAF would be required to do so.

d. Headquarters, USAF, and the Air Force Public Information Office, were immediately informed of this incident. Preliminary action was taken to determine the reason for Colonel Hathaway's request and the proposed use of the information.

e. It is contemplated that this telephone conversation was being taped. However, this could not be confirmed. At the completion of telephone conversation, which lasted approximately 30 minutes, the information was still withheld.

SUBJECT: Brief Summary of Re-Evaluation Sighting July 29, 1952

The following are those points and data of significance which lead to a final conclusion:

1. Three (3) Navy fliers stated that they observed a similar object at approximately 1950 hours on July 29, 1952. The only difference was that the object was a "meteor." (Albuquerque Herald dated July 31, 1952)

2. We should like to point out that the annual "meteor shower" the Aquarids, is at the height of activity from July 26th through August 5th. These meteors, which are very fast and brilliant, or "fireballs" in the vernacular, are often mistaken for unusual aerial phenomena. This particular observation fits into this classification.

3. It is my personal statement that the unidentified flying object which published blow-ups or his picture pointed out that the object had a small tail.

4. Psychological aspects: Strange part of the story is why Capt Gregory was taking pictures. Also, I was unable to determine that Mr. Gregory was or is, in any way, connected with the Air Force or any other military organization. It appears to me that his interest in this "strange" (Captain Gregory's comment) phenomena was a personal one, rather than an official one.

5. Also, his statements: "I began shooting pictures because I might be the only person to have a clear picture of this." (Comment of interviewer) This statement tends to point out that he was aspiring toward the goal of obtaining the first clear picture of this incident.

6. Consolidated, we feel that the objects for 3-1/2 minutes (mid to late proven by psychological tests that this could possibly be the basis of other correlation and supported data given above, was probably a "meteor" as first observed by the Navy fliers.

7. Colonel Johnson: This is submitted in the event that the matter which a decision is necessary reference may come to a head or resolve in a potential controversy (public relation's wise) as far as the Air Force is concerned. It is offered for whatever action or information will be released without specific approval or advisory from this headquarters.

The image contains a photograph of a UFO, which is described as a "Flying Saucer" film that was allegedly taken by a Cleveland TV station. The text below the image states "What Is It?" and provides some additional context about the film, including that it was taken in 1952 and the person who took the film, Ralph Mayher, declined to reveal the source of the object.

Here is the full text extracted from the document:

CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER
"Flying Saucer" Film Elusive, Too
By WILSON HIRSCHFELD
This is a photograph of a "flying saucer" which was filmed by a television station in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 31, 1952, according to Ralph G. Mayher, who says he was responsible for the film.
Mayher, a television cameraman, says he was filming a thunderstorm on that date when the strange aerial object suddenly appeared in the sky. He continued filming, obtaining the images shown here, before the object disappeared.
The film is said to be the property of the television station which employed Mayher at the time. Though often requested to do so, Mayher has steadfastly refused to disclose the identity of the station, explaining that he is bound by a pledge of secrecy.
A former official of the U.S. Air Force, who was present when the film was first viewed, is quoted as saying that the object "cannot be identified as any known aircraft." The film has been analyzed by several experts, who also report that they are unable to explain the nature of the object.
Though many inquiries have been made, the custodians of the film have consistently declined to make it available for public viewing. Mayher says he has received numerous offers for the film, but has always refused to consider a sale.
"I'll never show it again," he says. "I am through with it." Mayher, who says he has had other unusual sightings, believes the film record of this "flying saucer" will remain a mystery.

Four views of the "flying saucer" that flashed over Miami Beach last night are reproduced here from the film taken by Marine Pfc. Ralph C. Mayher. The film was released without comment by Third Marine Air Wing officials. Miami Daily News artists did not retouch the "saucer" itself, which loses some detail in reproduction, but did retouch scratches on the film and designated the object with arrows. 

The photos show the "orange, yellowish object" was bowl-shaped with a projection on top. It speedily vanished, after being watched for more than three minutes.

(2) Statement of PRIVATE FIRST CLASS _____

1. Enclosed (1) and (2) are forwarded herewith to substantiate the report of unidentified flying objects sighted over Miami Beach, Florida, on 29 July 1952.

2. On the evening of 29 July 1952, Private First Class _____ and Private First Class _____ of Headquarters Squadron 4, were standing with a group of civilians outside the Marine Corps Air Station when they observed 3 bright lights, round in shape, and maneuvering rapidly near Miami Beach. They stated that the objects appeared to be about 1,000 feet in elevation and were under intelligent control. According to the statements, the objects made a sharp turn and accelerated to a very high speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.

The sighting was called to the attention of the Duty Officer who in turn notified the Public Information Officer. The Commanding General's office and the nearest Air Force radar station were notified. The statements of the two Marines are attached herewith.

Mr. _____, the Public Information Officer, was called and the details of the sighting were given to him. He stated that the information would be processed under the supervision of the Public Information Officers and that any release of information would be made at the discretion of the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

The Air Station and the Public Information Officer are awaiting further instructions as to what is to be done concerning this incident.

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
5. Since there was so much interest shown in the film by the press, this Command decided to make the photographs public to avoid having the press speculate as to what they were. We could not allow the general public to think that the Marine Corps had 20 very spectacular pictures.

During the afternoon of 20 July 1952, the Press Aide newspaper, the Herald and the Daily News, made calls requesting prints of the object which had been taken by the Public Information Officer of the Marine Corps Air Station that this Command had no knowledge of. The photographer, a Private First Class Marine had merely taken a few snapshots at the scene during the off-duty hours of the photographers. They were merely released in the public interest.

2. Captain Norval R. SMITH Jr., called the Public Information Officer and asked whether or not this Command had any statement to make that they might use. He was told that the Command had no statement to make and that they would wait until the Public Information Officer received the prints from the photographers, at which time they would call them back to seek any information or copies of the films. SMITH apparently did not receive any information or copies of the films, as he made no further contact.

3. During the afternoon of 20 July 1952, Captain John MC CASH, Public Information Officer of the Marine Corps Air Station, received a telephone call from Lieutenant NEVIL.L.E Intelligence Officer in this area. Lt. NEVILLE stated that he had been contacted by the District Intelligence Officer of the SIXTH Naval District, for evaluation. 

9. In the afternoon of 21 July 1952, a telephone call was made to the Officer of Public Information, Marine Corps Air Station, Corpus Christi, Texas, advising him of this incident. CAPT. JAMES, PIO at that station, stated that they had no knowledge of the incident and that no photographs had been taken at their station.

31 JULY 1952
STATEMENT OT LTC...., S08-S, USAS, PILOT, PLAT:

After hearing talk of flying saucers for the past two years or more and their increased observation over the same period, I decided to take home a saucer and there through a day or so in charge to see what action could be taken. The 26th of July, 1952, I decided to take home a saucer and there through a day or so in charge to see what action could be taken. The day, July 26, 1952, I decided to take home a saucer. I did so and I got one and brought it home in my car. It was in shape somewhat like a doughnut, and turned by T. V. on and made more talk of flying saucers. The next day I put the saucer in my car and made another trip to get another one and settled two in my house. I had a hunch that if we could only get hold of one of these saucers we might do something with it in Washington, D. C.

I drove my saucer over to Miami Beach. We began to look for Mr. ... whom we finally located and 1 gave my story. I told him that we finally located Mr. ... and I gave my story. I told him that I had a saucer in my possession and that it was still working. The next morning I took the back off his saucer and let him examine it. He seemed very suspicious and called in two other men. They examined the back of the saucer and made comments. This was early in the morning. I was working on the premises there was no official business involved.

Practically no noise. In my estimation, from 2:10 p.m. to 2:30 p.m., nothing happened. Nothing caught my eye except an ordinary looking jet plane going by at normal speed. The speed range of this saucer was a bright orange color and shaped. It was not the color or the shape of any known aircraft on the river again. Immediately 1 jumped to my feet and secured it to this - is there any indications that this is a secret or classified experiment that we should not pursue? I am completely convinced that this is a genuine unidentified flying object and not the result of any secret experiment by anyone. I wouldn't care to estimate the size of this saucer but I would judge it to be about 30 feet in diameter. After 15 or 30 seconds of being visible, it accelerated at a speed that I couldn't possibly estimate - it was literally gone in the wink of an eye. Repeated sightings convince me that no known aircraft could perform like this, be hovering, and then accelerate at such a tremendous rate of speed. I couldn't see any propeliants or power plant - just the shell as a whole seemed to move. I am still of the opinion that we should continue to keep this under surveillance and find out if possible what is behind these strange sightings.

STATEMENT

My name is Lieutenant Colonel, USAF, a military pilot (emergency rating) with approximately 1500 hours of flying time. I am presently employed as an -in the

as Assistant-on July 29, 1952, at approximately 2230 hours, Mountain Standard Time, on Tuesday, I stepped into the front yard of my house located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and observed a phenomenon which I am unable to positively identify.
Continued observation during the ensuing two to three minutes produced the following result:

DETAIL: The image held steady on a bearing of approximately 225 degrees from my position, and remained in that stationary condition for approximately 1 to 2 minutes, making exact determination of bearing difficult. The bearing was approximately 230 to 235 degrees from my position. Five to seven minutes later the image departed in a westerly direction at a speed far in excess of any conventional type of aircraft, as far as I am aware. Its speed was such that it disappeared from my line of vision almost immediately.

ELEVATION: The image held steady throughout the sighting at an elevation of approximately 20 to 45 degrees above the horizon.

SIGNAL: When originally sighted the image had a horizontal axis of a length which, it appeared to me, was 2 to 3 times the size of a medium-sized aircraft. This axis seemed to be under mechanical control, as it would shift from a horizontal to a vertical position, and back again, several times during the sighting. I could not judge the absolute size over land, nor its distance from me with any degree of accuracy.

SPECIAL MANEUVER: When the image departed, it appeared to be falling or descending rapidly to a flattened elliptical eclipse, slightly distorted or elongated (perhaps by low speed would cloud) in the air. Its speed at this time was faster than any aircraft I have ever observed. The object disappeared rapidly and was out of sight almost immediately. The entire duration of the sighting was approximately 15 seconds after this change had taken place. No sound was heard throughout the sighting, indicating that if it was an aircraft, it was operating without engines...

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document describing some kind of unexplained aerial phenomenon.

Clean circle revealed. There are several round markings or spots on the page, which the text describes as "clean circles revealed". 

As soon as I saw it I knew it was something out of the ordinary. It was a strange sight, somewhat difficult to describe accurately. The image was of a craft or object in the sky, apparently emitting a light or luminescence. The sight was only momentary, though, and faded quickly. It was not possible to evaluate its size, distance, or exact nature in the brief time it was visible.

The sighting has puzzled me, and I am unable to arrive at a satisfactory explanation for what I witnessed. The thing that impressed me most was the suddenness and brevity of the event. This suggests to me that it was not a normal aircraft, and I am at a loss to account for its appearance and disappearance. I hope further study and investigation of similar sightings may eventually lead to an understanding of this phenomenon.

1. In accordance with instructions via phone this date, transcript attached herewith as requested.

2. The individual in the case was interviewed 31 July and stated substantially as follows:

- This object was sighted 230 hours 29 July 1952. It was described as far exceeding in brilliance and size any aircraft he had ever seen. It exhibited a steady, but pulsating light coming from within the object in the background. This object appeared to be approximately 20,000 feet in altitude and of considerable size. The witness further stated that the object, after hovering in his vision for some time, disappeared at a speed which he estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour.

The Marine reported seeing the object after midnight, and it was confirmed by the Air Sea-Rescue Corps officials. The article mentions that the Marine had requested permission to take the pictures and that the photos and information were provided to the U.S. Air Force. Overall, the article appears to be a detailed account of a UFO sighting and the subsequent investigation.

MIAMI'S SAUCER?
Marine Here Snaps 'Disc'
By LARRY BIRGER, Miami Daily News Staff Writer
A strange "orange, yellowish object traveling at more than 2,000 m.p.h." was photographed last night by a Marine near the Miami Beach area. The Marine reported the sighting to the Air Sea-Rescue Corps officials, and they confirmed the existence of the object.
Forty feet in diameter, the object was first sighted about 12:45 a.m., the Marine reported. He took two pictures of the "flying saucer' with a .16-millimeter camera from the sky. The pictures were turned over to the Air Force for analysis.
Only eight seconds elapsed between the time the Marine first saw the object and when it disappeared from sight, the Marine reported. The object, he said, moved in a straight line and then made a right angle turn and shot straight up out of sight.
He had requested permission to take the pictures from the home Air Force base he was stationed at and they granted it. He kept the film in the camera until 5:05 p.m. the next day, when he took it to his home on the outskirts of Miami. 
Neighbors, shouted "Look there, in the sky," about 9:30 p.m. the previous evening. For several seconds, they reported, the object came into view and then disappeared.
The Marine, who has not been identified, took the pictures and information to the Public Information Office of the U.S. Air Force. Marine officials at the Air Sea-Rescue Corps confirmed the sighting.
They stressed the fact that the pictures were taken in an official capacity and that "all we did was to have him take the pictures. They were taken from the Air-Sea-Rescue Corps ground."

The image contains a photograph that appears to be an unretouched photograph of an object seen by a Marine cameraman who was hunting for "flying saucers" at Miami Beach, Florida on Tuesday night. The image is described as being blown up to 10 times its size from a 16-millimeter film negative. The article discusses a theory that the photographed object is called "Plane's Light" and provides details about the incident and the photograph.

AUG 1 1952
YOU PAY YOUR MONEY...
Photographed Object 
Is Called Plane's Light
The latest theory about the "or-only caught in 'sight frames,'... yellow-ish object" seen and photographed over Miami Tuesday night is that what was spotted was the front light of an airplane coming in for a landing at the International Airport.
John L. King, an aerial gunner during World War II, said today he is certain that what he saw in the sky above Miami that night was photographed by a Marine was a plane that was on its way to land at the International Airport.
Miami who works in the control tower at the field reported that a plane was due to land in Miami about the time the object was seen in Sur-side. It was looking for "flying saucers" when he went to the home of Berman Mayr, 5200 Byron Ave., shot about 40 feet of film on the object. He said it was "very tal clear" and had "definite shape."
On a hunch Mayr went to the outside home of Glens who two nights earlier had reported seeing an object in the sky traveling at great speed. Mayr photographed the object on 16-millimeter film. He said it was traveling "more than 2,000 miles an hour."
Marine officials in Miami re fused to comment on the photos, but said the object was "very tal clear" and had "definite shape."

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

POSSIBILITY OF CONFUSION: The image was not confused with either the planet Venus which appeared larger than the actual image, or the cloud-like image which is produced. Bearings were different, and there was a distinct difference in color, size and shape while the image at original sighting was yellow and gave the impression of pulsating substanses and solidity.

The image was not confused with the moon, which did set a few minutes later (6:37 hours). The bearing or azimuth was 30 degrees less than that of the "sighting" seen. And the elevation was 25 degrees more than the actual sighting viewed. Additionally, the moon on July 29, 1952 was in its last quarter which would have made it appear elongated rather than appearing as the image.

The Albuquerque Air Force office at Kirtland AFB seems unlikely to have been mistaken for a weather balloon, since it would have been encounted at a much smaller angle. While a possibility existing, it would probably not have appeared quite so large if illuminated not by any actual source of light.

SUPPORTING WITNESSES: There were none present with the observer at the time of sighting.

I hereby certify that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

at Albuquerque, New Mexico, this 30th day of July, 1952.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains no photograph, only text. The text describes reports of three flying discs observed in South Florida, including details about the objects' appearance, movement, and witness accounts. The text also mentions the involvement of the U.S. Navy in investigating the sightings.

AUG. 9, 1952

South Florida
Reports Three
Flying Discs

Herald staff writes:
Excited sky watchers in South Florida reported seeing three mysterious discs or flying saucers over the state early Sunday morning, August 3, and answering the questions given in recent "flying saucer" reports.

The light was seen by several people in different locations, according to the accounts. One man said he saw the discs hovering over the sea for more than 20 minutes.

Three Miami Beach residents reported seeing one of the 40-foot discs shortly before 3 am, Sunday, disappearing towards the north over the water at high speed. They described the object as a brilliant light, apparently supported on a dark frame, which swooped across the sky as they watched.

One witness declared it was "as large as 40 or 50 feet across from our angle," and was maneuvering rapidly in various directions before zooming out over the ocean at tremendous speed, disappearing in a few seconds.

Several others reported seeing similar objects at about the same time in nearby Hollywood, Fla. and elsewhere. One woman said she saw three separate objects fly over her Hollywood home, hovering, then speeding away.

The Navy dispatched the USS Coral Sea to the area to investigate, but the objects had disappeared by the time the ship arrived on the scene.

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object described as about 50 feet long and reddish-orange in color. The text below the image states that it was photographed by a photographer named Ralph Mayer for a Cleveland TV station, and he made movies of the object using a 16mm lens. The Air Force, to whom he turned over the film except for one frame, declined to comment on the object.

Now, as per your request, here is the output of the text found in the document:

Ralph Mayer, photographer for a Cleveland TV station, said he made this picture of an unidentified flying object while he was servicing in the Marine Corps in 1952. He des-cribed the object as about 50 feet long and reddish- orange in color. He made movies of it, using a 60-mm. lens, and turned over all of the film except one frame, from which this picture was made, to the Air Force, who, he said, declined to comment on the object.

The image appears to contain a newspaper article with a photograph. The photograph shows a man named Ralph C. Mayher, who is described as being involved in the investigation of a "flying saucer" film.

The text of the document is as follows:

Flying Saucer' Film Elusive, Too
BY WILSON HIRSCHFIELD
A news correspondent over the telephone last night from the Air Intelligence Center files has failed to elicit any information about a film showing a "flying saucer" which was purportedly sent to a naval base. It was earlier reported that, since the film was originally submitted to a naval base, it must remain with naval intelligence.
The Pentagon letter was signed by Lt. Col. King, Deputy Chief of Defense Intelligence. The picture has never then wired to the Miami Information Center, as earlier rumored.
RALPH C. MAYHER
tells in hush-hush investigation of flying saucers. Shooting 16 feet of film that summer night, Mayher said he watched the mysterious object dart across the sky, change in size and form. He said it was about 2,000 feet distant.
Later, he said, he interviewed three airline pilots who saw the mysterious object that night. Hoping for another chance to film, Mayher kept many night watches on the chance it might appear again. But he never saw it again.
He believes that the flying saucers are from another world which he believes will soon visit us.

AF FORM 112--PART II 
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1950

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

SUBJECT: Flying Oblong Transport (U)

1. Mrs. ------ , 3310 N. Bayshore Dr., Miami, Florida reported an object sighted on 29 July 1952.

It appeared to be as large as a four-engine transport. The object was circular in shape, was brilliant white in color, and gave off considerable brilliance, although no trail was observed. It hovered over the Keys, Florida about 75,000 feet for about 10 minutes.

The object turned spontaneously red to green about every two seconds; while it was green a white aura was observed around the object. When the object started to turn red, it disappeared almost instantly. No sound was observed. There was no trail. Stones and stars were sudden.

Mrs. ------ is the wife of a Naval officer. In 1950 she and her daughter were observing a flying object which she described as a "wrapped balloon". She reports that this incident lasted for about an hour. She claims she thought to have made a report on this observation to Naval authorities.

The flashing - burst - surge of light from red to green would appear to be approximately every two seconds would indicate the possibility of a conventional aircraft, with rotating beacon and definite stop and start actions weakening the aircraft hypothesis, and strengthening the possibility of some phenomenon less susceptible to the limitations of machine performance, and more akin to the characteristics of a powered device of an unconventional nature or origin. The phenomenon is not readily explainable and is therefore open to speculation.

AF FORM 112 - PART II
SUBJECT: FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SITING
THE SIGHTING: There was an unidentified object reported for the northern part of the city. The object was described as round, luminous and increasing in size. The object remained stationary for a period of time and then began moving in a southerly direction at a rapid rate of speed. The object was observed repeatedly in the sky for a period of approximately 30 minutes. The object was observed to dim and increase in size at different times during the sighting. No sound was associated with the object.
THE OBSERVATION: The observation of this object was both visually and by radar. The radar observer stated that he had the object on his radar screen for a period of approximately 30 seconds. During this time, the object was traveling at a speed of approximately 1300 mph and was observed to make an abrupt turn of 180 degrees. The object then accelerated to an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from the radar scope.
THE CONCLUSION: Based on the available data, it is the opinion of the intelligence officer that the object observed was an unidentified flying object. No conclusive evidence was obtained as to the nature or identity of the object.

The text in the document reads:

"The undersigned, on the 29th of July, 1952, was on a routine training mission, acting in the capacity of radar observer. In our flight over the area of 5,848 square miles, we had just finished six instrument passes on a B-29 aircraft at approximately 9,000 feet. After completing our instrument check, we observed an unidentified object approximately 25 miles north of us, at an altitude between 15,000 and 20,000 feet. We saw what appeared to be a group of smaller objects trailing the main object. This was kept under observation for approximately ten minutes. We were then told to look higher. By pilot, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt and myself, I was picked up at target on my scope at 60 degrees, until I kept the pilot in a starboard turn until I lost the target due to the turn. The unidentified object, when I looked at the scope, appeared to be moving at a speed over 500 mph. It was observed by three pilots and two radar observers in an area over Albuquerque, New Mexico. After the target disappeared from my scope, we tried unsuccessfully to regain contact with it. The object was giving a positive radar return, was several miles in diameter, and was level with us (at approximately 15,000 feet). After it jumped to 50,000 feet in a matter of seconds, it then jumped up to 350 knots (TAS) and gave chase. During the chase, GCI kept advising us on the target's movements, which were staying approximately ten miles ahead of us. The pilots and radar observers were unanimous in describing the object as silver or metallic, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and oblong-shaped. There is no other means of identification, other than visual and radar detection, although the sequence of events and bluish-white exhaust that is visible is the only means of substantiating our story. I have never experienced any sighting like this before."

The document is signed by "Victor W. Yeaman, 1st Lt, USAF, Radar Observer".

STATEMENT

On 29 July 1952, the undersigned was on a routine night training flight. The flight consisted of two F-84J aircraft which were working in conjunction with a TPS-1B tracking unit. After completing six attempts on the range, the number two man was called back to a higher altitude. While climbing out on a heading of 270 degrees at an altitude of 20,000 feet, the TPS-1B radar lost the aircraft as information on its exact position. Shortly thereafter, the TPS-1B radar picked up the aircraft again at 26,000 feet. It informed the four aircraft and they were unable to locate the area and found nothing. I informed the radar operator of this, and was asked to reacquire the target. It was very clear so I attempted to observe it. Le Ro[i]fen[b]erg called and said he had a target at 2130 (local). Four miles at a bearing of 300 degrees. His instructions were: "observe the target, it is intermittent". He then said the target was gone. At 2140 (local), the target reappeared and I attempted to observe it. It was intermittent at first and then appeared to be solid. It rapidly accelerated and climbed to an altitude of 40,000 feet and then returned to the range area at 21,000 feet. The chase was abandoned as the target was so fast. After following the target for approximately twenty minutes, it disappeared and no contact could be made on it. The chase was abandoned as the target was getting too low, and no sight could be made on it. Changing flight which has a definite sequence of lights, had and erratic course, and during the time it was observed, no other known aircraft were in the area and it appeared to keep from six to ten miles from the aircraft. It had the target on their Radar and it appeared to keep from six to ten miles from the aircraft.

CASE #9
29 JULY 1952
DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On the night of 29 July 1952 an Army station in Michigan observed an unidentified object. The object was described as being cone-shaped. The target was plotted at 350 knots on a 360 degree heading for 20 minutes.
Three F-94's were in the area making practice runs on a 3-25. One of these F-94's was requested by GCI to investigate the unknown target. The F-94 climbed out of the practice area on a heading of 270 degrees to 20,000'. GCI called and requested a visual search be made at 3 o'clock. A turn to 3 o'clock was started when the radar operator got a lock-on from a target at 2:30 o'clock level, 8 miles away. The lock-on was held for only 30 seconds. As the F-94 was turning, the target became a bright, flashing, object. The F-94 could not get close enough to the object because it was traveling at a speed of 750 knots or 360 degree turn followed 16 course minutes at an IAS of 350 knots at 21,000'. The light remained between 12 and 1 o'clock. At the time of the lock-on, the F-94 was 20 miles W of Port Huron, Michigan.
The GCI radar was tracking both the unidentified target and the F-94's on the scope. Since the F-94 could not close, it was assumed by GCI that the object increased its speed.
The other two F-94's were airborne, but they continued making practice runs on a 3-25 and were not in the area at the time of the sighting.
The stars, Capella, is directly in line with the F-94's line of flight and the F-94 would have been flying straight toward it. It is very low on the horizon and appears to be flashing green, blue, and red, etc. At first it was believed that this what the pilot saw, but when it was established that both the F-94 and the UFO were being carried on the same GCI, this could be ruled out.
It could be that this is a series of coincident weather phenomena affecting the

1956 Comments
The "lock on" is not considered to be significant since it lasted for only 30 seconds.  
Permit contact lasted for 20 minutes; therefore, the speed of the target was not greatly in excess of that of the pursuing aircraft.  
There is no radar description to make a very vivid picture of this type of aircraft.

In reply to your letter, AFOIN-ATLA-S, dated 2 October 1952, the following information has been obtained. Some of the information relating to this incident is given in your letter and this information is not repeated.
a. The unidentified flying object appeared on the GCT scope for a period of approximately twenty (20) minutes. The object was traveling at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet and was heading in a general direction of 330 degrees.
b. GCT reports the speed of the object at 550 miles per hour, and not 600 knots as was given in the original report from this section. According to the report from the intercepts, they increased their speed in order to close in on the object. The controller records that the object maintained its initial speed until the interceptor aircraft increased its speed, at which time the speed of the interceptor aircraft increased.
c. The operators were unable to measure the acceleration of the object.
d. The unidentified object and the pursuing F-94D appeared simultaneously on the GCT scope. The time and duration are not available.
e. The other two F-94D aircraft which were in the air at the time were unable to intercept the unidentified object due to the lack of information on these aircraft is available.
f. The unidentified object obtained the thirty (30) foot size and angle subtended was determined to be approximately seven (7) miles due to the limited information available.

UNCLASSIFIED
51st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Subject: Flyobept (cont'd)

The pilot and the radar observer of the pursuing F-94B aircraft report that the object sighted initially for a period of approximately twenty (20) minutes, commencing at 0240 (EWT) hours. The location was approximately twenty (20) miles due west of Port Huron, Michigan.

Apparently, this is rather reports that the object was a regular weather balloon which was scheduled for release at 0220 (EWT) hours on that date. In the event of a failure in the balloon, it takes an estimated three-half hour to precare another one. It is believed that no further action is indicated.

TO: Chief Flight Officer
127th Interceptor Squadron
Self-Reg Air Force Base
Albuquerque, New Mexico

In reference to your flyobject of 7 July 52, the following data is recorded to establish velocity:

For what duration did the unidentified flying object appear on the GCI scope? Could GCI operators determine blip size or target altitude?

The GCI scope operators who originally estimated the fly-ing object's velocity stated the object appeared to move extremely fast and traveled in a straight line and that they pressed the speed as the object was tracked onto the target.

If so, were the operators able to measure the acceleration? What was the apparent acceleration of the object?

Since the object was visually observed, what was the apparent size and apparent luminosity of the object? How did it compare with known objects in the sky at the time, such as stars or planets?

Were there any releases of any balloons in the Roswell area around the time of this incident? If so, can exact time and tracks of such releases be established as well as the initial size and trail of the balloon-carried object?
