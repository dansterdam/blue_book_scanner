Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the southwest sky these evenings as darkness falls is not an airplane, a flying saucer, or some bright light hung in the sky as part of an experiment.

What you see is the planet Venus, now coming into view in the evening sky and soon before its disappearance from the evening sky early in 1958.

Venus is far brighter than any other star or planet seen in the night sky and there is a good reason why. Because it can be observed long before the sky is dark, it is best seen in broad daylight!

After it passed behind the sun last April 14, Venus has gradually been drawing to the east of the sun, daily. That means that it will be seen in the evening sky earlier each night, and so remain visible in the west after the sun has set. On Nov. 18 it will be farther east of the sun, hence remaining in the sky for the longest time after sunset.

These maps do, however, show stars that are now visible. Facing south about 10:00 p.m. your local time, at the first of November, 10:30 p.m. on the 15th and 8:00 p.m. on the 30th.

Bright Birds in the Sky

[The rest of the text continues, discussing astronomical details about Venus, constellations, and upcoming celestial events]

Note: The document contains two star charts/maps showing the night sky orientation, but as instructed, I have not described those charts, only transcribed the text.
