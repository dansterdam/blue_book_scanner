The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph present on this page, only a simple sketch of an oval-shaped object with an arrow next to it. The text on the page asks the observer to describe various details about the object, such as its sound, color, and the edges/shape of the object. The observer is also instructed to draw a picture showing the shape and direction of the object. Based on the context provided, this appears to be a form or questionnaire used to gather information about UFO sightings.

The full text transcribed from the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - Bluish-grey

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please put an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred 
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

- page 6 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with various questions about an unidentified object observation.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. If POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One): a. Head of a pin, b. Pea, c. Dime, d. Nickel, e. Quarter, f. Half dollar, g. Silver dollar, h. Baseball, i. Grapefruit, j. Basketball, k. Other _________________

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): a. Certain, b. Fairly certain, c. Not very sure, d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Moving at a fast rate of speed if disappeared from sight.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it take? Give some appearance as to the object which you saw.

The object was constructed out of some shiny metal, such as aircraft metal. I would estimate it to be about the size of a medium bomber, that is, larger than fighter type aircraft. It's shape would be like that of a football in the air.

NAME: [REDACTED]
SIGNATURE: [REDACTED] 
DATE: November 19, 1952

Member of the 1942-53 AACS Det., Laredo AFB, Texas was on duty as Shift Supervisor on 19 November 1952 when a bright white-grayish object appeared to be traveling at a very high speed. It did not show the slightest ow of power and was difficult of estimate the height as approximately four (4) thousand feet. The object appeared uncontrolled in its northwest traveling east and when it again appeared it was heading in an easterly direction. An estimated time of 15 seconds elapsed from the time the object was in sight there was a F-23 aircraft that had just turned initial about 12 miles south of the field for landing on Runway 22 R. After the object disappeared a queried the pilot of the F-23 to whether he has seen the object. The pilot of the F-23 had no knowledge of anything - the reason I ask is I am certain that this object was not a known type of aircraft; it did not continue this object with any of the T-28's flying local.

TR-921-52        2 3 2  

1. Statement by [REDACTED]

On Nov 22, 1952, I was on duty at the Control Tower at Laredo AFB, Texas. At approximately 1240 hours when I saw an object appear which was very high and seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be approximately four (4) thousand feet high. I cannot estimate its dimensions but it seemed to be quite large. When it first appeared it was very dim and difficult to see, but as it came nearer it became more distinct. It seemed to be cylindrical in shape and appeared to have a bright glow around it. It remained in sight for approximately five (5) to seven (7) minutes and when it started to move away, it rapidly disappeared from sight.

2. Statement by [REDACTED] 

On November 22, 1952, a member of the 3552-2 ACS Detachment, Laredo AFB, Texas, was on duty at the Control Tower at Laredo AFB. At approximately 1240 hours, he sighted an object which he was unable to identify. The object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 4,000 feet. It was difficult to determine the exact size of the object, but it appeared to be quite large. The object was a dark color and seemed to have a glow around it. It remained in sight for approximately 5 to 7 minutes before rapidly disappearing.

STATEMENT
AACS DETACHMENT, LAREDO AFB
ON 9 NOV 52 AT 19 39 792, A MEMBER OF THE 1923-9 AACS DETACHMENT, LAREDO AFB, WAS ON DUTY AS CONTROLLER IN THE RADAR APPROACH CONTROL ROOM AT LAREDO AFB. IT APPEARED TO BE A WHITISH-GRAY OBJECT WHICH WAS TRAVELING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED; IT DID SEEM BELOW THE ESTIMATED HEIGHT OF APPROXIMATELY FOUR (4) THOUSAND FEET. I CANNOT ESTIMATE THE DIMENSIONS BUT IT APPEARED TO BE LARGE AND CYLINDRICAL. THE OBJECT APPEARED IN THE SOUTHEAST TRAVELING NORTHWEST. NORMALLY VISION OF THE OBJECT IS OBSCURED BY INTERVENING WINDMILL AND HIGH TENSION WIRE STRUCTURE. I ESTIMATE THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT 2 OR 3 SECONDS. AT THE TIME THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT, THERE WAS JUST TURNED INITIAL ABOUT FOUR (4) MILES SOUTH OF THE FIELD FOR LANDING ON RUNWAY 29R. AFTER THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED, I CALLED THE PILOT OF THE F-33 ON INITIAL IF HE HAD SEEN ANYTHING BECAUSE I WAS NOT SURE WHETHER THE OBJECT HAD PASSED IN FRONT OF OR BEHIND THE JET. I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS OBJECT WAS NOT A KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. TRAFFIC CONTROLLER ADVISED ME THAT THE WHITISH-GRAY COLOR AND CYLINDRICAL OUTLINE DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY OF THE T-28'S FLYING THAT NIGHT. I DID NOT CONFUSE THIS OBJECT WITH ANY OF THE T-28'S FLYING THAT NIGHT.

STATEMENT

AACS I C. Carnahan, Laredo AFB, Tex., AP 17 342 039, a member of the 1922-8 MACS through Control Tower Operator, when checked the objekt in the Control Tower 8 Nov at 1925Z. This object was a strange objekt which travelled at a tremendous rate of speed, and disappeared. I first noticed the objekt while on duty. It travelled straight and level and then climbed at a terrific rate of speed, appeared for approximately 3 seconds. No method of propulsion, vapor trails, or light of any kind was observed. This objekt was sighted while I was watching the G-26 type aircraft on initial for landing on Runway 35R. I'm certain the objekt was not a known type of aircraft. The object was not a course from type of aircraft and I'm certain there was F-22's flying local besides the one I-23.
