The night of Nov. 3, 52 I was working in the Control Tower at Laredo AF Base. I worked the evening shift from 1630 to 2230 hours. It was while looking out an open window for a T-33 jet aircraft, I saw the object moving in from a Southwesterly direction as passing a short time directly South of Laredo AF base. Then disappearing, immediately, in a southeasterly direction. I saw the object against a dark cloud bank. The object appeared to be light in color against the dark cloud bank. I do not know the distance or the altitude the object was away from my position.

[Narrative text begins]

member of the 1923-9 AACS Det-achment, Laredo AFB, Texas was on duty as Shift Supervisor in the Control Tower 3 November 52 at 1825C when I saw an object appear southwest of Laredo AFB. It appeared to be a whitish-grey object which was traveling at a very high speed. I do not know the distance it was from the field but estimate the height as approximately four (4) thousand feet. I cannot estimate its dimensions but it appeared to be long and elliptical. The object appeared in the southwest traveling east. Momentarily my vision of the object was blocked by a brace dividing two windows and when it again appeared it was heading in an easterly direction and disappeared from sight. I estimate the object was in sight 2 or 3 seconds. At the time the object was in sight there was a T-33 aircraft that had just turned initial about four (4) miles south of the field for landing on Runway 35 R. After the object disappeared I queried the pilot of the jet as to whether he has seen the object. The pilot of the T-33 on initial said he had not seen anything. The reason I asked the pilot was because I was not sure whether the object had passed in front of the jet or behind the jet. I am certain that this object was not a known type of aircraft, local traffic flying in the vicinity of Laredo that was known traffic consisted of the one T-33 and approximately six (16) T-28's. I am certain I did not confuse this object with any of the T-28's flying local.

SIGN 17 INFORMATION

Intelligence Branch, Hq USAF            TR-921-52             2     2

1. Statement by [redacted]

I, [redacted], Laredo AFB, Texas, was on duty as night supervisor in the Control Tower, 3 Nov 52 at 1820p when I saw an object moving southwest of Laredo AFB. It appeared to be a relatively bright object which was travelling at a very high speed. I do not know the distance it was from the field but estimate the height as approximately four (4) thousand feet. I cannot estimate its dimensions, but it appeared to be long and slightail. The object appeared in the southwest traveling north.

When first sighted, the object was in sight for approximately three (3) seconds. At the time the object was in sight there was a T-33 aircraft that had just turned initially northwest. I was in the tower cab and the object was clearly visible. For the object's size, etc. For the object I positioned the plot of the jet as to weather. I had been in the tower approximately 15 minutes and it was because I was not sure whether this object was a front of the jet or behind the jet. I am certain that this object was not a known type aircraft. Local traffic flying in the vicinity of Laredo that was known consisted of T-33 and approximately sixteen (16) T-28's. I'm certain I did not confuse this object with any of the T-33's flying local.

2. Statement by [redacted]

I, [redacted], A/2C, AF 17 342 039, a member of the 1923-9 AACS Detachment, Laredo AFB, Texas, was on duty in the Control Tower, 3 Nov 52 as a Control Power Operator, when at 1820p, I saw a strange object through an open window of the Control Tower. I saw the object as a light colored elliptical object against a dark cloud bank. I was unable to estimate the distance from the field but by comparing the object and the cloud formation I would estimate the altitude as approximately three (3) or four (4) thousand feet. I can't estimate the dimensions. It first appeared to glow and ran faster than I could follow and then at a tremendous rate of speed disappeared travelling southeast. After two object passed it was in sight only long enough to tell much direction it took before disappearing. The object was in sight for a total time of approximately 3 seconds. In rather unusual, vague, and somewhat indefinite terms was observed. This object was sighted while I was watching a T-33 type aircraft on initial for landing on runway 35R. I'm certain the object was not a known type of aircraft, although there was T-28's flying local besides this one T-33.

STATEMENT

I, A1C, AF 19 389 792, a member of the 1923-9 AACS Detachment, Laredo AFB, Texas was on duty as Shift Supervisor in the Control Tower 3 Nov 52 at 1820h when I saw an object approximately southwest of Laredo AFB. It appeared to be a whitish-grey object which was traveling at a very high speed. I do not know the distance it was from the field but estimate the height as approximately four (4) thousand feet. I cannot estimate its dimensions but it appeared to be long and elliptical. The object appeared in the southwest traveling east. Momentarily my vision of the object was blocked by a broad dividing two windows and when it again appeared it was heading in an easterly direction and disappeared from sight. I estimate the object was in sight 2 or 3 seconds. At the time the object was in sight there were an initial count of four (4) miles south of the field for landing on Runway 35R. After the object disappeared I queried the pilot of the jet as to whether he had seen the object. The pilot said he had not seen anything. The reason I asked the pilot of the T-33 on initial if he had seen anything was because I was not sure whether the object had passed in front of the jet or behind the jet. I am certain that this object was not a known type of aircraft. Local traffic flying in the vicinity of Laredo that was known traffic consisted of the one T-33 and approximately sixteen (16) T-28's. I'm certain I did not confuse this object with any of the T-28's flying local.

STATEMENT

I, C_______, AACS Detachment, Laredo AFB, Texas 17 342 039, a member of the 1923-9 AACS Detachment, Laredo AFB, Texas was on duty in the Control Tower 3 Nov 52 as a Control Tower Operator, when, at 1820, I saw a strange object through an open window of the Control Tower. I saw the object as a light colored elliptical object against a dark cloud bank. I was unable to estimate the distance from the field but by comparing the object and the cloud formation I would estimate its altitude approximately three (3) or four (4) thousand feet. I can't estimate its dimensions. It first seemed to slow up and pause directly south of the field and then at a tremendous rate of speed disappeared traveling southeast. After the object paused it was in sight only long enough to tell which direction it took before disappearing. The object was in sight for a total time of approximately 3 seconds. No method of propulsion, vapor trails, or light of any kind was observed. This object was sighted while I was watching a T-33 type aircraft on initial for landing on Runway 35R. I'm certain the object was not a known type of aircraft although there was T-28's flying local besides the one T-33.
