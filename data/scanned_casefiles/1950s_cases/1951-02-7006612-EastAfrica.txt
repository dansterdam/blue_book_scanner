SUBJECT: APPEARANCE OF AN ALLEGED "FLYING SAUCER" OVER MT. KILIMANJARO, TANGANYIKA

The Consulate reports the alleged appearance of the first "flying saucer" to be observed in East Africa which at is stated was seen about 16,000 feet above Mt. Kilimanjaro the morning of February 19, 1951 by the crew and passengers of the East African Airways "Dakota" plane flying from Nairobi via Dar es Salaam.

From descriptions given by the crew and passengers the object, although termed a "flying saucer" appeared to be a bullet shaped with a fin at one end. It was observed through binoculars by several of the passengers and was declared to have three distinct colors, along with a well-defined metallic. As soon as the "flying saucer" was observed, contact was made with Nairobi by radio to ascertain whether the French Consulation already knew about it. The French plane was approximately in the direction of the "flying saucer" could have been mistaken for it but no information could be furnished beyond the statement that the course of the French plane was about 17,500 feet.

The "saucer" was seen for about 17 minutes by both the crew and passengers of the Lodestars after which it began to climb rapidly and move eastward toward the coast. It was stated by some of the passengers that to them it appeared like a bright star although through binoculars its shape was relatively clear. One of the passengers, Mr. [redacted], an American, is reported to have taken pictures of the "flying saucer". Although the Consulate attempted to contact Mr. [redacted] its efforts were unfortunately unsuccessful and his reported to have been called for February the following morning after his arrival in Dar es Salaam. It is also reported that a color film was taken of the object by Mr. [redacted], also an American, who was aboard the plane. He was alleged to have used 20 feet of film to "shoot" the "saucer" and to be confident that he would obtain more result.

To make certain that there was no mistake concerning the "saucer", Mr. [redacted] of the plane, obtained the signatures of the other passengers to a document stating they had personally observed it.

In view of the alleged appearance of various "flying saucers" in the United States and in other parts of the world it is believed that this information concerning the first one to be

The Review publishes for the first time in its columns news from the past. They will probably be new to many of our readers, but our purpose is to give a complete picture. From the many items of news, this is so correct as to implication. Some of these items will be of great interest to those who are now engaged in movement.

By one or other of the papers, or from the press generally, it must be borne in mind, was launched in 1927. Another source is from a year later.

FEBRUARY 19, 1951, dawned bright and clear at Nairobi, Kenya Colony, East Africa. At Nairobi's West Airpot, the regular Monday morning London was realized in its morning flight at Mombasa, and soon passed over what was to meet their astonished eyes, being 20 minutes later. At 7 a.m. exactly, with nine passengers and a crew of two aboard, the London Star took off.

All went well until 7:20 a.m., when suddenly the radio officer grew the attention to its superior, Captain J. Bicknell, to a bright object like a wide star, apparently hanging motionless easily 7,000 ft. above Mount Kilimanjaro. Captain Bicknell's first reaction, he said later, was to say nothing. The two watched, then strange object for three minutes, then, as it showed no signs of vanishing, informed the passengers. One began promptly studying the object, amazed at a powered pair of field-glasses, which the radio officer helped an extended cell to Bicknell, nearby, giving an account and description of the thing.

During the interview some days later, Captain Bicknell calculated that in the three minutes the object was observed, it covered 60 miles; that, in other words, it spoke could have been nothing short of 1,200 miles an hour. The period of observation was brief, behind no vapor trail and, to all who saw it, had no visible means of propulsion.

D. W. Bicknell, mathematically speaking, a "strange" was suggested as the possible cause, but the radio officer discounted it. "Mirages," rarely seen without clouds, he stated, "nor would that explain the object's movement." He continued...

sketch of the object, which showed a canopy

side. Later, in connection with its origin, the

-- AN OUTSTANDING SIGHTING --
THE MT. KILIMANJARO ENIGMA

February 19, 1951, dawned bright and clear at Nairobi, Kenya, Colony, East Africa.

At Nairobi West Airport, the regular Monday morning Lodestar was readied as usual for its morning flight to Mombasa, and soon passengers filed aboard, little dreaming, any of them, of what was to meet their astounded eyes barely 20 minutes later.

At 7 a.m. exactly with 9 passengers and a crew of 2 aboard, the Lodestar took off.

All went well until 7.20 a.m. when suddenly the radio officer drew the attention of his superior, Capt. J. Bicknell, to a bright object like a white star, apparently hanging motionless easily 10,000 ft. above it, Kilimanjaro.

Capt. Bicknell's first reaction, he said later, was to say nothing. The two watched too strictly, object for 3 minutes, then, as it showed no signs of vanishing, informed the passengers. One began promptly studying the oddity, amazedly through a powerful pair of field-glasses, whilst the radio officer flashed an excited call to Eastleigh nearby, giving an account and description of the thing.

Eastleigh's suggestion in return was that the object might be a drifting Meteorological balloon, but checking, on that possibility, after inspecting the enigmatic object for several minutes, Capt. Bicknell found that the more he examined it, the less it could possibly be mistaken for a balloon. It was a dull silver colour and mixed at roughly an interval, along the unusual girth with vertical dark bands. The entire outline, he found, was unmistakably distinct; nor, though it appeared to be incredibly distant, was its sharp outline obscured in the least detail by intervening haze.

Capt. Bicknell estimated the thing was over 200 ft. long, bullet-shaped, and apparently constructed of metal which shone brightly. On first sighting it, the Lodestar was heading roughly towards it, and watching it closely as they approached, Capt. Bicknell perceived another detail. The thing possessed a square-cut vertical fin at one end. There were no signs of movement, it was absolutely stationary.

So it remained for 17 minutes. Passengers of the Lodestar were taking turns with the field-glasses and their own eyes had come to...

taking photographs, when suddenly the enormous thing began to move eastwards, slowly at first, and rising as it did so. Before it reached 40,000 ft. at which point it was virtually lost sight of, the sides of the "wasome, whall-like object were seen clearly to be without a break in their smoothness, no w... s of portnote... relieved the harsh purity of line, no engine mounts or jet pods narred the perfectly streamlined hull.

The day being exceptionally clear, there were no cloud formations in evidence anywhere, and Capt. Bicknell calculated that in the 3 minutes of visible movement, the bullet-shaped object covered 60 miles; that in other words, its speed could have been nothing short of 1,000 m.p.h. during the period of observed flight. It left behind no vapour trail and to all who saw it, no visible means of propulsion.

During an interview some days later, Capt. Bicknell said that his impression was that the unidentified thing was some kind of flying machine, and with this, his radio officer, a Mr. D.W. Merrifield, unhesitatingly agreed. "Mirage" was suggested as the possible cause, but the radio officer discounted it. "Mirages are rarely seen without a cloud," he stated, "nor would that explain the object's movement". He commented that if the object was a flying machine it was 500 years ahead of anything we have today.

Nairobi "Sunday Post" the following Sunday said: "If this report had come from a few isolated individuals it would soon be discounted. But it came from responsible airline officials and nine ordinary travellers". It too, dismissed both the balloon and "mirage" theories, and concluded that hopes of a "natural" explanation had begun to fade. Other theories ran, iron Martian visitors to radio-controlled weapons.

Fragmentary evidence accrued since then increases the sum total of knowledge but little. U.S. "LIFE" Magazine early in 1952 published a sketch of the object, which showed it to closely resemble an ordinary lipstick tube lying on its side. More recently, in connection with a learning the whereabouts of the photographs taken from Capt. Bicknell's plane, the Australian Flying Saucer Bureau learnt that "the only known public photograph of the object shows a blurred spot on the film". A motion picture film taken by another passenger was "quite clear" we learn, but the same reliable source stated, either laconically or ominously, it is hard to tell which, that "the man with film is supposed to have disappeared".

So the case stands, at present, one of the most puzzling and enigmatic unexplained Saucer Sightings recorded in Australian Flying Saucer Bureau Files.
