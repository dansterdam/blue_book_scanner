1. On 10 November 1957 an unidentified object was observed to the west-southwest of Tokyo. Observers reported the object as a flame, clear or bright light with the color of the body reported as white or orange-red color. One witness reported a single tail which appeared as a flame white a second witness reported what appeared to be three tails) or cylindrical with yellow and orange colors. Newspaper account reported the object was also sighted from Nagoya, Aomori and Kyoto (citing Asahi Shimbun).

2. Observers reported the object traveled in a slight arc or parallel to the earth. Object was observed by change and disappeared by fading out. Time of observation was from an extended (10 to 45 seconds).

3. Observations reported were visual, unassisted by optical devices.

4. Sighting occurred between 0845 and C9002 time at dusk.

5. Observers were located at approximately 35° 28' N 139° 25' E and 35° N 139° 28' E.

6. The observers included Lt Col Marshall E. Bailey, AO 400539, Japan-Korea J.M.T.B.; Headquarters Fifth Air Force; and Special Agent Jackson, Unit Intelligence, Command, Naval Forces, Japan.

7. Weather at the time of the sighting was clear with visibility better than 10 miles. Observers reported stars visible at the time of sighting. Winds were reported as: Surface (200) - 10 knots, 10,000 ft. (280°) - 65 knots, 40,000 ft. (280°) - 115 knots.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

8. In the Tokyo area during the reported time period at this time of year, surface conditions are sufficiently dark to require lights for driving, while at higher altitudes some lighting remains from the setting sun. The sighting of the object from Nagoya about 0850E time indicated the object was at a great height and of large size or high intensity to be visible at two locations separated by some 125 N.M. The Tokyo Astronomical Observatory while not actually viewing the object assumes that it was probably a meteor. Positive identification cannot be made of the object, although the observers' descriptions, duration of sighting, and large area over which observed indicate a meteor.

COMMENTS (In narrative style, expand on your evaluation as checked above. Your comments, guidance and helpful criticism are
appreciated by collectors. Carefully prepare and detailed Evaluation Records will improve the quality of reporting and
provide you with intelligence information of higher quality.)

1. This report is too general. It does not contain sufficient data upon which to properly evaluate or analyze towards some valid conclusion or identity of the UFO.

2. EI and overseas units should exhaust all efforts, through complete investigations and local checks, to identify UFOs or to obtain sufficient data, which, without confirmation of the reporting unit's conclusions (i.e., Comments of the reporting officer), or analyst's evaluation can be made. Ref: Par 16, AFR 200-2.

3. Essential data could have been obtained if checks or investigations were made as outlined in par. 5, AFR 200-2, particularly checks with military and civil air operations, to include radar units if anything unusual or aircraft were seen in the air in that area with the time reported.

4. Using minimum "line-in-sight" of 10 seconds, doubt arises if object was a meteorite. Meteories are seldom seen for more than 6 - 7 seconds. If maximum of 45 seconds, time object reportedly was a jet aircraft, as hundreds of similar type reports have shown by subsequent investigations. Jet afterburners generally appear white or orange red when in operation.

5. There is a considerable amount of air traffic or air-crossings Japan. Observations made in or near military areas, particularly in air base or civil air traffic areas should be viewed with some suspicion as being aircraft. This holds true even there is no concurrent or subsequent radar reporting of anything unusual from the locale, the apparent reliability of military or official observers notwithstanding.

6. The mere reporting of a colored light streaming across the sky NW of Tokyo is therefore of little value, although admittedly the UFO could be a meteorite, if the minimum time-in-sight reported was over estimated. However, this Center cannot conduct on-the-spot investigations and detailed checks. It must rely on the overseas facilities reporting the sightings.
