a. The objects (2) sighted appeared to be spherical and orange and shining like the sun in color. There was no regular formation but one object thought to be larger than the other appeared stationary while the smaller of the two seemed to dart away from the other at a rapid rate of speed and then to reappear in close proximity to the larger. There was no exhaust, sound or conventional type of propulsion noted.

b. The objects were sighted between 1900 and 1930Q and the observation lasted between twenty to thirty minutes. Sundown was at 1856Q.

c. The observation was made visually from the ground, elevation approximately 700 to 1000 feet above sea level. Zeiss Jena, 16 x 50 field glasses were used to observe the objects. The observer could not distinguish anything more about the object when using the glasses except that the movement mentioned in paragraph a, above, was not discernible to the naked eye and could be seen through the glasses.

d. The observation was made from a high bluff, latitude 18°11'30"; longitude 67°13'30". The point of observation overlooks the city of Mayaguez and Mayaguez Bay. Distance from observation point to sighted object could not be estimated. Heading from point of observation to objects was approximately 270°.

e. There were five witnesses to the sightings.

Mr. [redacted], a Puerto Rican business man and lawyer, and a man of credibility and dependability in his community. His description, which the major part of the report is based.

Mr. [redacted], an American, ex-Air Force pilot, son-in-law of Mr. [redacted], is also in business and Mayaguez and impressed the investigator as a person of sound judgment and integrity.

Miss [redacted], a Puerto Rican college student, 20 years old. Miss [redacted] appeared to be a sensible young person, well informed and of mature judgment.

The other two witnesses were Mrs. [redacted], and Mrs. [redacted]. The investigator did not have the opportunity of talking to these people.

It is the opinion of the investigator that all the observers are people of sound judgment and integrity and were not influenced by mass hysteria.

f. The weather conditions at the time of the sightings were described as clear with visibility of approximately twenty (20) miles. Clouds were described as a alto-stratus. Many weather station 25 miles from the scene of the sighting recorded the cloud formation at the time as 4-2. Sighting appeared to be estimated near the second layer of clouds.

h. Investigations made on the sight following the original sighting revealed no natural circumstances that can adequately account for these sightings.

Report No: IR-24-52
Date of Report: 19 May 1952
Date of Information: 14 May 1952
Prepared By: G. D. McAdams, Captain, USAF
Source: Puerto Rican civilians

On May 14, 1952, between 1900 - 1930 hrs Q, two spherical flying objects were observed off the coast of Mayagues, Puerto Rico by civilians. The objects sighted were bright orange in color and appeared to move when observed with field glasses. The attached report is the result of an investigation made by Intelligence personnel of this wing.

From the evidence received it was not possible to determine whether or not this incident has any significance in the current "flying saucer" investigation.
