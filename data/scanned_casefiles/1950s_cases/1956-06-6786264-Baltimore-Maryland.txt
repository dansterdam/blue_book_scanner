Education: 12 years
Qualifications: Former U.S. Navy Aerial Photographer

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was contacted by phone as he was not at home during investigators stay in the Baltimore area. An appointment with SOURCE was set up for 7:00 p.m. E.S.T. on 18 June 56 at SOURCE's residence. However, investigators waited at SOURCE's residence over two hours, but SOURCE did not arrive. During phone conversation, SOURCE gave the investigator the impression that SOURCE was over confidential in his ability to identify aerial phenomena. In view of the above, it is the investigator's opinion that the SOURCE be considered only fairly reliable, even though he was definitely sincere in his statements.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was just beginning to close the window in his home when object appeared in the southeast at approximately 15/02+02 June 56. SOURCE observed object for a period of five(5) to ten(10) seconds before it disappeared in the northwest. SOURCE stated that the object was approximately 45° from the horizon and this angle fascinated SOURCE during sighting.

SOURCE described the object as being cigar shaped with the front half of the object definitely outlined by a row of distinct individual lights. SOURCE liked this portion of object to a row of sixth lights. The rear half was reddish blue as if it was exhaust trails and not a real part of the object.

SOURCE stated that the apparent size of the object could be compared to the palm of a man's hand at arm's length. SOURCE stated that, although speed and altitude would be hard to estimate, he believed object to be traveling at 2000 m.p.h. When first sighted and then object accelerated to an unbelievable speed and thus disappeared. SOURCE considered the altitude of object to be between 1000 and 2000 feet.

SOURCE described object as being solid with an appearance similar to that of a model airplane fuselage. SOURCE further stated that unless this country or other countries on earth has such a device, unknown to the public, he believed it to be a ship from another planet.

SOURCE described the sky as being dark with a few scattered stars and the moon shining brightly. SOURCE stated that the object's path at no time went in front of or behind any other object in the sky. According to SOURCE, there were scattered clouds and the weather was hot and dry with no wind.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with the Baltimore Filter Center revealed that a multitude of reports on the mentioned object were reported from 1502352 Jun 56 to 1503532 Jun 56. According to COG personnel, Civil Defense officials in the Baltimore area were also receiving continual reports on the object.

2. The CAA Office in Washington D.C. (GJPJ C053) indicated that the only unusual phenomenon in vicinity of Baltimore, Maryland was an advertising aircraft.

3. The control tower at Friendship International Airport in Baltimore, Md. stated that the only unusual phenomenon in the area was an advertising aircraft with various lighting schemes. This aircraft was flying low over the Baltimore area at approximately 1502002 Jun 56 for an unknown period of time.

4. The U.S. Weather Bureau at Friendship Airport in Baltimore indicated the following data at 1502002 Jun 56:
   Surface Winds:    W5, Seven (7) knots
   Ceiling:          Unlimited
   Visibility:       Ten (10) miles
   Cloud Coverage:   Four-tenths (4/10) at 30,000 feet

5. Mr. Schoeneach, Air Vertising Co. of 17 Guilford Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland stated that his company had no aircraft in the area at the time object was sighted. However, information received from Mr. Schoeneach revealed that another air advertising company from Hagerstown, Maryland (GWK 1739) was operating in the area.

6. The information received from the USAF Weather Office at Andrews AFB, Maryland (GJPJ 1843) indicated the wind direction and velocity in degrees and knots as follows:
   Surface     -  240° - 7
   6,000       -  210° - 4
   10,000      -  150° - 16
   16,000      -  210° - 10
   (The above constitutes the winds at 1503002 Jun 56)

   Ceiling was 30,000 feet, clouds, light scattered; visibility, ten (10) miles.

7. A check with John Hopkins University in Baltimore indicated that no unusual phenomenon had been sighted by university personnel on the evening of 14 Jun 56.

8. A check with the 647th AC&W Squadron at Manassas, Virginia (GJHJ 3145) revealed negative radar contact of the object. However, due to the number of reports at the Baltimore Filter Center, the 647th scrambled an F-86D at 1503462 Jun 56 from the 95th FIS. Negative interception was accomplished by F-86D. Pilot sighted aircraft, Four (4) different search lights, but nothing that resembled reported object. Pilot stated that it was hazy at 5,000 feet and above in the Baltimore area.

9. T/Sgt. Musselman and S/Sgt. Kilroy, both assigned to Baltimore COG Filter Center, stated that they observed an object between 1501302 Jun 56 and 1502302 Jun 56, but that it was definitely an advertising aircraft flying low over the city. Neither man was on duty at the time of sighting.

11. Mr. Edward Henderson, Associate Curator of the Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C. in charge of meteors stated no unusual phenomena were observed during the period of the reported sighting.

12. A check with Mr. Dean Castang, 101 Devonshire Rd., Hagerstown, Md. revealed that he was operating an advertising aircraft in the Baltimore area on the evening of 14 June 56. Mr. Castang was flying a ST-13 aircraft with a lighting scheme on the bottom of its wings similar to the type utilized on exterior of the New York Times Building, N.Y.C., N.Y. (HUBL 0246). The lighting arrangement spelled out "PAUL SILVER" in large letters. According to Mr. Castang, he approached the city at 1501032 Jun 56 from the southwest at a true altitude of 1500 feet indicating an airspeed of 90 MPH and flew counter-clockwise orbits around the city. Mr. Castang stated that he climbed and descended as he circled the city to maintain his altitude. At the end of each orbit on the southeast side of the city, Mr. Castang flew directly to the center of the city, executed a 45 degree turn to the east, flew approximately 7 miles and then continued on southeast-clockwise orbit of the city. According to Mr. Castang, he landed his aircraft at Harbor Airport, Baltimore, Md. at 1502202 Jun 56. Mr. Paul Silver, of Adv. Sales Co., Baltimore, Md. stated the hired aircraft. Castang for the advertising stunt. Mr. Silver further stated that in the future Civil Defense authorities would be notified previous to engagement of advertising aircraft.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. Preparing Officer concludes that this sighting was definitely caused by advertising aircraft mentioned in par 12 of Part 3 this report, for the following reasons:

a. Sighting time of object and flying time of advertising aircraft were approximately the same. Neither SOURCE could give exact time of sighting.

b. The course of the advertising aircraft coincides with the approximate course of object described by SOURCE in Part I and II.

c. Lighting as described by SOURCE in Part II would be the same as that on the advertising aircraft. SOURCE in Part II estimated a tremendous speed of object which could have been due to the short time of sighting and low altitude of aircraft.

d. Due to negative radar contact accomplished by the 647th AC&W Squadron.

e. Due to haze that was reported by Lt. Albright, pilot of the P-860 scrambled from 95th FIS, Andrews AFB, Md. Poor visibility could give varied impressions as to the speed and appearance of a low flying aircraft.

f. Short time of sighting by SOURCES in Part I and II would not enable them to properly identify any object.

g. Contacts with all well known observatories and government agencies in the area indicated that no unusual phenomena were evident in the area at the time of sighting.

h. All agencies that were cognizant of the advertising aircraft and were able to identify it as such.

Education: Sixteen (16) years
Qualifications: Knowledge of commercial aircraft and interest in flying due to his son's participation in Baltimore GOC Filter Center.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a slender built, middle age man whose mannerism reflected that of a good citizen. SOURCE appeared to be sincere in his statements and was very cooperative with investigators. Having traveled on commercial airlines and due to the particular of his son in GOC activities, SOURCE seemed to have a good knowledge of various types of aircraft, their appearance and relative speed. In the opinion of the investigators, SOURCE's intelligence was above the average college graduate. SOURCE's statements are considered to be reliable by the investigators.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE noticed object while playing cards on a patio outside his home at approximately 150232CZ Jun 56.

SOURCE stated that the object was sighted in the west at an angle of 45° from the horizon and moving on a true course toward north with no erratic changes in position or acceleration. According to SOURCE the speed of object remained constant. SOURCE somewhat later than a commercial airliner, but less than that of a jet. SOURCE described the object as being cigar-shaped of a deep yellow color with fuzzy or blurred edges and small traces of red and blue exhaust trails. Object emitted no sound that could be heard by observers during the sighting, which was a period of one (1) or two (2) minutes. Object retained its original shape and color during sighting. SOURCE stated that the object had the appearance of a baseball held at arm's length.

During the entire observation, the sky was dark with a few stars and the moon was shining brightly. SOURCE stated that at no time did object move in front of or behind any other object. Object disappeared from view at the same angle from the horizon as it appeared. SOURCE described weather as being hot and dry with little or no wind.

SOURCE stated that he believed the object to be some type of man-made flying machine. However, he also stated that the object was not the type of aircraft currently known to the public as it emitted no sound and its appearance was quite unique. SOURCE further stated that object gave the impression of gas in a tube emitting brilliant light.
