MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF, INTELLIGENCE
ATTN: COLONEL PATTISON, AFGIN-X

SUBJECT: (C) Review and Comment - UFO Rpt, Adana, Turkey 12 Mar 58

1. Further to the request from your office regarding the sighting reported from Adana, Turkey, during March 1958, our records indicate the following:

a. The incident was submitted as a CIRVIS report under provision of JANAP 145, March 1954, and not as an Air Force UFO report.

b. The report is very meager and lacks essential data necessary for more detailed analysis or positive conclusions.

c. The object (a fast-moving, orange colored light) is not considered a "UFO" within the definitions of AFR 200-2, 5 Feb 58, but rather an "unidentified aircraft".

d. The description, characteristics, flight pattern and maneuvers rule out rockets or missiles.

e. There have been reported overflights into Turkey from the Soviet and Arab Bloc countries. It should be noted that Adana is just outside the Northwest border of Syria. (Secret)

2. A word of explanation regarding source's statements that the light appeared to stand still for a brief period; and that there was an apparent absence of sound. Based on the many similar UFO incidents investigated and analyzed by the Center over the last 12 years:

a. Jet exhausts, and particularly afterburners in operation, when viewed from a zero-angle of sighting on the ground, e.g., when the aircraft is in a climb and viewed directly from the rear at night and from a distance, often appears to remain motionless in space until the pilot goes into a turn. This is a well-known illusion and reported quite often.

Memo to ACS/1, Attn: CN-X Subj: R & G UFO R, A, T 12 Mar 58

b. As you know, on very dark nights, it is possible to observe aircraft mostly from their jet or afterburner flame, with no sound. This also holds true with aircraft condensation trails during the day.

3. On the basis of the data given, there is no reason to believe that the "unknown light" observed was other than a high-altitude jet aircraft from a neighboring "East Bloc" country assuming, of course, that all friendly aircraft flights were accounted for. (Secret)
