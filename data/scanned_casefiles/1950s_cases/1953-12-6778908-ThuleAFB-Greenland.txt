UNCLASSIFIED
INTELLIGENCE REPORT NO. 3-12-29
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects 13 December 1953
COMMENT & DATA: On 10 December 1953, the 6315th AISS, Thule AFB, Greenland, reported the following:
DATE OF INCIDENT: 12 December 1953 TIME OF INCIDENT: 2358 GMT
INVESTIGATING OFFICIAL: Harold R. Miller, Captain, USAF
SOURCE(S): Eye Witness
DESCRIPTION: On 12 December 1953 at 2358 GMT, the control tower operator at Thule AFB, Captain Miller, observed 2 bright unidentified objects in the sky. 
The objects were at an estimated altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet and were traveling at a speed of approximately 500 knots. They were observed for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
The objects gave the impression of an oblique shaped object with light emitting from the rear. As the objects moved away, the light intensity appeared to diminish.

The following information was elicited in interrogation of D. D. Irving, Captain, pilot of F-94 and observer of sighting reported in paragraph 3:

2. The following information was elicited in interrogation of observers at Thule Air Base, Greenland.
a. Observers were on an airborne training mission at the time of sighting. Approach heading was from west to east at approximately 30,000 feet. The object was first observed at about 43 miles in front of the aircraft, giving the impression of being at a great distance. The object appeared to be approximately the size of an orange on the windshield. 
b. The object was observed to be cigar-shaped, white in color, with an apparent size of approximately 4 feet in length and 2 feet in diameter. The object was observed to be in level flight and was closing in on the aircraft at an extremely rapid rate of speed. The closing rate was approximately 1 mile per 1 to 1.5 seconds. The object approached to within 1 mile of the aircraft before changing direction and streaking upward out of sight. The flight path of the object was described as straight and level to a point within 1 mile of the aircraft, then a steep climb of approximately 70 to 80 degrees to the vertical with no change in speed evident. The object was observed for a total time of approximately 20 seconds.
c. Communications facilities (GCA, CPN, etc.) and other possible informative measures were brought to bear on the sighting, but no additional information of a confirming nature could be obtained.
3. The following information was elicited from further interrogation of D. D. Irving, Captain, pilot of F-94 and observer of sighting reported in paragraph 3:
a. This sighting was made during the same flight at approximately 250 knots at a position approximately 45 to 55 miles south southeast of Thule Air Base, Greenland, heading 1300 speed. The size of the object was estimated to be the size of a first magnitude star. The flight path of the object was described as straight and level until it turned at a point approximately 1 mile from the aircraft, then a steep climb of approximately 70 to 80 degrees to the vertical at a speed which the pilot turned in a general direction of object but lost it due to its extreme speed. The pilot turned the aircraft in the direction of the object but could not regain visual contact. The pilot burned in a general direction of the object for approximately 1 minute with no visual contact re-established.

UNCLASSIFIED
the time of sighting was 7-54 observer aircraft (rapra-b-2) which was at an altitude of 13,500 feet. the sighting was visible from other aircraft. For weather sightings see paragraph 3 observer believes this sighting to be due to the aircraft in question was orbiting in an area. For preparing officer's evaluation see paragraph 9.
4. The following information was elicited from further interrogation of a-4 radar observer of 7-54 and observer of sighting:
a. This sighting was made during the same flight at approximately 7-54 observer aircraft was at altitude 25,000 ft, heading 320 degrees, air speed 410 knots. This was approximately 30 miles south-east of Thule air force base. The object appeared to be metallic and bright as object previously sighted. Object appeared to be the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. On the first sighting the object was below and south of observer aircraft. As the observer aircraft approached the object it disappeared at an extremely high rate of speed to the east over the horizon. For weather and wind conditions see paragraph 3. The only know traffic in the area at the time were observer aircraft.
5. The following information was elicited from further interrogation of a-4 radar observer of 7-54 and observer of sighting:
a. This sighting was made during the same flight at approximately 7:54. observer aircraft was at altitude 25,000 ft, heading 320 degrees, air speed 430 knots. this was approximately 40 miles east of thule air force base. the object was first observed on a-4 radar at a distance of 30 miles. the object was traveling at a high rate of speed and made a slight course change from due east to east-northeast. the object was at approximately 15,000 ft altitude and approximately 3 miles distant from the observer aircraft. straight and level at a speed estimated at 600 knots. the object disappeared from a-4 radar briefly and then reappeared. the observer saw it for approximately 3 seconds in a slightly downward trajectory just before going out. the object was silver or light grey in color. no vapor trail was observed and no sound was heard. the only known traffic in the area at the time were observer aircraft.

6. The following information was obtained in interrogation of 1st Lt. Green, 17th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Thule Air Base. Both observers color 1st Lt. Green, pilot and 2nd Lt. Duncan, radar observer of the 17th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Thule Air Base. Both observers color:

a. Observers were on an airborne training mission at the time of sighting. At approximately 1635Z, they were flying at an altitude of 22,000' climbing to 24,000', turning to a heading of 160°, speed 300 knots. They observed an object which looked more like a flame than a light. The object was assumed to be a celestial body from which a tail or trail blazed of 1-2 miles in length. The color of the object was yellow-orange in shade. The object's apparent size was approximately 1/2 of the diameter of a dime held at arm's length, or approximately 3 mils. It faded out in the distance after approximately 6 miles. The object appeared to be at the same altitude as the aircraft and was off to the right of the aircraft's flight path a distance of 3-4 miles. The object moved away at an estimated speed of 50 to 100 knots and elevation of 5° from the observer's position, traveling in a straight and level path.

b. No interception was attempted or airborne radar contact established. No other known air traffic in the area at the time of sighting. For weather conditions see paragraph 5.

7. The following information was obtained from further interrogation:

7. c. Duncan, 2nd Lt., Radar Observer, F-94, and observer of sighting recorded information in paragraph 6.

8. This sighting was made during the same flight at approximately 1635Z. At this time, the aircraft was approximately 5220 knots at a position approximately 7 miles east of Thule Air Base. Observers saw an object described as having same size, shape and characteristics as described in paragraph 6, when first sighted the object. The flight path of the object was on a heading of 360°, straight and level at a speed of approximately 1000 knots. The object was on a heading of 350° for a period of 1 second. The pilot turned to intercept but no interception was made. Interrogation revealed no other known air traffic in the area at the time of sighting. Negative information relative to other sightings was obtained.
