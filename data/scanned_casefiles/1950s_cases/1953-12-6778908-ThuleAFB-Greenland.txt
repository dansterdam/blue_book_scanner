INTELLIGENCE REPORT NO. 10-10-53

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting

COUNTRY & AREA: Greenland, Thule Air Base Area

DATE OF REPORT: 10 December 1953   DATE OF INCIDENT: 9 December 1953

REPORTING OFFICER: Harold R. Miller, Captain, USAF

REFERENCES: 6078th Air Base Group Message UMPF 7610 and UMPF 7653

The following information was compiled from interrogation of six (6) observers of UFOB sightings on 9 December 1953. Due to the similarity of the sightings over a relatively short period of time and position correlation, interrogation results of each sighting will be submitted herein and in the same sequence as reported in electrical transmission, THUF 7623.

1. The following information was elicited in interrogation of Irwin, Capt. Ralph H. Jr.; Roberts, 2nd Lt. Robert J.; and Hobart, 2nd Lt. Robert J. of the 318th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Thule Air Base, Greenland. Both observers concur in details and opinions:

a. Observers were on an airborne training mission at the time of the sightings. They were flying in an F-94 aircraft at altitude 25,000', heading 090, speed 220 knots, at a position approximately 25 statute miles of Thule Air Base when both saw a glowing light. The sighting occurred at 0912Z. The light appeared to be oblong in general appearance, bluish white in color, and the size of a half dollar hanging at arm's length. It gave the object an impression of an oblong shaped object with light shining through it. Its tail, trail, exhaust, or wind were noted. When first sighted, the object was at approximately 090 altitude 3,000' away at an azimuth of 10° to port and elevation of 20° from their aircraft. The flight path of the object was south to north, straight and level with speed estimated at 1000 knots. The object appeared to be on a ride out at an azimuth of 20° to starboard and elevation of 20° to 30°. The object was observed for a period of approximately 2-3 seconds. The pilot turned into the general heading of the object, and no further visual contact was accomplished, and no airborne radar contact established. The only known traffic in the area at the time of sighting was another 7-94 aircraft which was approximately 2 miles behind the observers. Interrogation of communications facilities (CGI, CGA, etc.) and other possible information sources provided negative information. For weather sequence see paragraph 6 herein.

Both observers stated the object was unique and not a meteorological phenomenon previously encountered. Observers evaluation of this sighting is a possible flying object. Both officers can be considered DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;

usually reliable. For preparing officer's evaluation see paragraph 9.

2. The following information was elicited in interrogation of
D. B. Cook, 1st Lt., pilot and M. G. Olsen, 2nd Lt., radar observer of
the 318th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Thule Air Base, Greenland. Both
observers concur in details and opinions:

a. Observers were on an airborne training mission at the time of
sighting, approximately 0y1232L. They were flying an F-94, aircraft at
altitude 26,000, heading 090, speed 230 knots, at a position approximately 22 - 23 miles south of Thule Air Base, when they observed a glowing
light. The object was a glob of light giving the impression of being
either round or slightly oblong with the green-white forward. Object was of intense white color, many times the magnitude of a star or planet.
No tail, trail exhaust, or sound noted. When first sighted the object
at approximately 30,000 altitude, 3,000' to 4,000' ahead and an elevation of 200 to 500 from their aircraft. The flight path of the object was
approximately south to north, from straight and level to 10° downward trajectory, with speed estimated at 1,500 knots. The object appeared to go
out with no after glow at an azimuth of 45° to starboard of their aircraft.
The object was observed for approximately 1 second. No interception was
attempted and no abnormal radar contacts established. The only known traffic
in the area at the time of sighting was the observer aircraft mentioned in
paragraph 1, which was approximately 2 miles ahead. Interrogation of all
communications facilities (AGC, CG, etc.) and other possible information
sources provided negative information. For weather sequence see paragraph
c. This was probably the same object as reported in paragraph 1. Observers
took available the sighting as a meteor at relatively close range and observer Zeigler states that object looked more like a meteor than a flying object.
Both observers can be considered usually reliable. For preparing officer's
evaluation see paragraph 9.

3. The following information was elicited from further interrogation
of 1st Lt. Irwin, Captain, pilot of F-94 and observer of sighting reported in
paragraph 1:

a. This sighting was made during the same flight at approximately
091232L. Observer aircraft was at altitude 26,000', heading 150°, speed
220 knots, at a position approximately 20 to 25 miles south south-east of
Thule Air Base. Observers noted a round, glowing, white light approximately
the size of a pea on the windshield, to tail, trail exhaust, or sound was
noted. When first sighted, the object was at approximately 28,000' altitude,
1 mile away at an azimuth of 90° to port and elevation of 10° from observer
aircraft. The flight path of the object was generally the same as observer
aircraft, straight and level with speed estimated at 400 knots. The object
appeared to go out with no fade out an an azimuth of 45° to port and elevation of 10° to observer aircraft. The object was observed for approximately
1 second. Pilot turned in general direction of object and lost it, with no
airborne radar contact established. The only known traffic in the area at

the time of sighting was F-94 observer aircraft (paragraph 2) which was
2 - 3 miles behind. Negative information available from other sources.
For weather sequence see paragraph 8. Observer believes this sighting to
be same object as in foregoing sightings and that object was orbiting in
area. For preparing officer's evaluation see paragraph 9.

4. The following information was elicited from further interrogation
of B. S. Cook, 1st Lt., pilot of F-94 and observer of sighting reported in
paragraph 24

a. This sighting was made during the same flight at approximately
C912352. Observer aircraft was at altitude 26,000', heading 390°, speed
220 knots, at a position approximately 30 miles South West of Thule Air Base.
Observer noted a globe of light, white in color and approximately half as
bright as object previously sighted. Object appeared to be on the 01/2 or a
fifty cent piece on the windshield. No tail, trail, exhaust or sound noted.
When first sighted the object was below and south of observer aircraft at a
position half way between the car wing and the horizon at an azimuth of
140 to port. Flight path of the object was from south west to north west,
straight and level at a speed of approximately 1000 knots. The object
appeared to go out with no after glow at an azimuth of 20° to port of observer aircraft. In a downward trajectory just before going out, the object was
observed for approximately 1 second. No interception was attempted and no
airborne radar contact established. The only known traffic in the area at
the time of sighting was an F-94, approximately 40 miles north of observer
aircraft. Negative information available from other sources. For weather
sequence see paragraph 8. Observer evaluates sighting as a meteor. For
preparing officer's evaluation see paragraph 9.

5. The following information was elicited from further interrogation
of R. H. Zeidler, 2nd Lt., Radar Observer of F-94 and observer of sighting
reported in paragraph 24:

a. This sighting was made during the same flight at approximately
C912462. Observer aircraft was at altitude 26,000', heading 690°, speed
230 knots, at a position approximately 40 miles west of Thule Air Base.
Observer noted a glowing light, white in color which appeared to be the size
of a pea on the windshield. No tail, trail, exhaust or sound noted. When
sighted, the object was at approximately 15,000' altitude and approximately
2½ miles off the port wing. Flight path of the object was parallel to observer aircraft, straight and level at speed estimated at 500 knots. The object
was increased in incandescence and then went out with no after glow, after observation was it momentarily 2 seconds in a slightly downward trajectory at
the end. No interception was attempted and no radar contact established.
The only known traffic in the area at the time of sighting was an F-94, 40
miles to the east over Thule. Negative information available from other
sources. For weather sequence see paragraph 8. Observer stated he got
the impression object was a meteor. For preparing officer's evaluation see
paragraph 9.

6. The following information was solicited in interrogation of L. G. Green, 1st Lt., pilot and T. G. Dungan, 2nd Lt., rider observer of the 318th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Thule Air Base. Both observers concur in details and opinions:

a. Observers were on an airborne training mission at the time of sighting, approximately 0912LST. They were flying an F-94 aircraft at altitude 24,000 climbing to 24,000, turning to a heading of 160°, speed 240 knots at a position 8 miles South of Thule Air Base. The observers saw an object which looked more like flame than a light. The object assumed the shape of a tail less flame or F-94 afterburner and the size of a trail blast from a distance of 3 - 4 miles. The color of the object was yellow-ish orange, no other tail, exhaust characteristics or sound noted.

When first sighted the object was at altitude 30,000 at a point 5 - 6 miles away at an azimuth of 5° to 10° to port and elevation of 5° from observer aircraft. The flight path of the object was North North West to South South East, straight and level with speed estimated at 1000 plus knots. The object disappeared directly over head and appeared to be making a run over the base. The object was observed for a period of approximately 1 - 2 seconds. No interception was attempted or airborne radar contact established. No other known traffic in the area at the time of sighting. Negative information available from other sources. For weather sequence see paragraph 8. Observers evaluation see paragraph 9. Both observers can be considered usually reliable. For preparing officer's evaluation see paragraph 9.

7. The following information was solicited from further interrogation of T. G. Dungan, 2nd Lt., Radar Observer, of F-94 and observer of sighting reported in paragraph 6:

a. This sighting was made during the same flight at approximately 0913002. Observer aircraft was at altitude 24,000, heading 090°, speed 220 knots at a position approximately 2 miles South of Thule Base. Observer saw object similar to that reported in paragraph 6, and described as having same size shape and characteristics. When first sighted the object was on a heading of 340°, straight and level at a speed of 1000 knots. The object disappeared overhead at an angle of 330° at an altitude of approximately 30,000. The object was observed for a period of approximately 1 second. The pilot turned to intercept but no interception made. Interference similar to ground harmonica was received on airborne radar scope. No other known air traffic in the area at the time of sighting. Negative information available from other sources. For weather sequence see paragraph 8. Observer stated object did not look like meteor. For preparing officer's evaluation see paragraph 9.
