The object was called to my attention by Mr.        as I was putting my car in the garage. It was located in the SW near Mt. Pisgah and was on orange red in color. Its movement was erratic by confined to a small area. I am certain of its moving as I checked its position in relation to stationary objects. I viewed it with the naked eye and with binoculars.

I pointed it out to my father and sister on reaching home about 150 feet from where I first sighted it. During a telephone call to east of its original location and at this point began to change color from a bright red to a bright green, blinking constantly. Informed me he intended to notify the military authorities. I decided to call the nearest air base myself. "After making the call my father pointed out the object had moved westerly and was no on the other side of Mt. Pisgah. All three of us viewed the object from my bedroom window and in checking our observations agreed that it was changing maximum colors. In examining plans visible were behaving in a like manner but that it was impossible to estimate size, shape or distance of the object.

I viewed the object west and about 1:50 a.m. to 2:52 a.m. during which time I gradually moved west and sank toward the horizon growing gradually smaller until lost from view.

The object was very easy to find in the sky even after moving to other positions to study it.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Major) Intelligence Officer
United Air Force Base
Middletown, PA.

REPORT NO.

Features. No didnt observe anything that might be described as an excerpt.

It's reported the object to have been traveling southward and indicated that the object was in his view for approximately an hour and forty-five minutes. No estimate of speed or altitude could be given.

In describing the maneuvers of the object, he remarked that it appeared to hover and then made some variations in altitude. This object was confined to a local area all during the observation.

He did add that he saw what to believed to be definitely a shooting star at approximately 2000 hours; however, he insisted that the object seen earlier didn't have the same characteristics.

Other witnesses to this second observation included Mr. Braccotori's father-in-law and his mother-in-law.

It should be noted that there had been no local publicity preceding this observation. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that local "propaganda" influenced the sightings.

Visibility on the night of 15 July at the time of the sighting was reported by local weather station to be approximately twelve miles. The weather at Middletown was ideal for such an observation.

In evaluating the reliability of the reports it should be noted that both Mr. and Mrs. Braccotori are local citizens and the radar operator and the later a bombardier. Both have had experience with aircraft and probably reliable observers.

This office is unable to give any explanation for the sighting and remains non-committal.

UNCLASSIFIED

of July 14, 1952 nightdue strong glitter in the
south east of Lehighton, Pa.

of Lehle, sitting a drive in shuttle, south
of Lehighton, I heard first a military air-
craft pass overhead flying nor'h. Quickly
thereafter, I observed two commercial aircraft
flying southwest varying mostly east, perhaps
few minutes apart. While writing the first
of these commercial planes, I took note of its
strong effect.

The object was situated in the south-
east when I saw a yellow glow at first. I
took it to be a planet, but then it seemed
to twinkle, as my first thought was rather
strange. The yellow glow had one peculiarity
as I watched. I wondered, I saw it move in
small circle upward down. Calling attention
to the object to the complete surprise, the car,
I asked if they thought it moved. They replied
my observation.

When returning home to Mauch Chunk, Pa.
& crossing the route near Mauch Chunk, I
discharge my sister-in-law at her home, I
again watched the object in the south-western
sky, & apprehended its distance, at twenty-five
