The image appears to contain a photograph of what seems to be a landscape or aerial view of the Peruvian jungle. The caption below the image reads "Platillos voladores sobre la Selva Peruana" which translates to "Flying saucers over the Peruvian Jungle".

Text extracted from the document:

Platillos voladores sobre la Selva Peruana

Junto con la foto que publical- a service de radio de la Corporacion Peruana de Radiodifusion, tenemos el siguiente informe:

Cerca de las 4 de la tarde del dia 5 de julio del presente ano, fueron captadas por una estacion de radio y television local de Lima, unas extrañas formadiones que evolucionaban sobre la Selva Peruana, a una altura que se calculo entre 500 y 600 metros, guardando una distancia de 800 a 900 metros entre si.

Segun las informaciones recogidas, estas formaciones se desplazaban a gran velocidad, calculandose su paso en quince minutos. La naturaleza de estos "platillos voladores" se pone de manifiesto ante el hecho de que se vieron claramente las siluetas de los mismos, sin que se pudiera precisar su forma y tamano exactos, debido a la distancia a que se hallaban.

Nuestras informaciones indican que estas formaciones fueron observadas durante algún tiempo, pero desaparecieron luego sin dejar rastro, en direction Norte-Sur.

The image contains a photograph showing what appears to be a luminous disc-shaped object over the Andes Mountains. The text mentions that the object was sighted on 15 August 1951 near Lima, Peru by an Air Force pilot.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT OF UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENON

Date of observation: 15 August 1951 
Time: 12:15-12:20 P.M.
Place of observation: Lima, Peru
Observer: Lt. Col. USAF-P, Pilot

The following is an excerpt translation of an article appearing in a Lima daily newspaper:

"Together with the photograph printed above, we have received a copy of the covering letter from the Aviation Corporal of the Peruvian Air Force, which states: On 15 August 1951, at about 12:15 P.M., the pilot of an Air Force C-47 transport, flying between Lima and Pucallpa, Peru, reported sighting a luminous disc which was seen over the Andes Mountains. The direction was south to north, and it was visible from 3 to 5 minutes. The object was disc-shaped, luminous, and appeared to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. The pilot estimated its distance to be approximately 8-10 kilometers. After the observation the pilot continued his flight without incident."

Our informant adds that this disc was seen again on 16 August in the Callao, Peru area, and estimates that the disc was visible for about 30 minutes during this sighting. The report states that the disc was first sighted at an altitude of about 13,000 feet and descended to an altitude of about 8,000-9,000 feet before disappearing. No further details are given.
