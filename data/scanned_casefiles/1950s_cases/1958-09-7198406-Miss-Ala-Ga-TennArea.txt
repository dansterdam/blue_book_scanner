ATIC FORM 329 (REV 26 SEP 52)


- page 1 -

A National Guard jet pilot, flying above Birmingham, Alabama, had to swerve his plane last Sept. 25th to avoid a collision with a blue-white object that had a steady flame shooting out from its back. The pilot, Capt. W. B. George, was flying at 2,500 feet at the time. A number of other reports, from the ground, were received by the local CAA about the same object on the same evening.

25 September 1958 - Miss, Ala, Ga, Tenn. Area

On 26 September 1958 the ATIC received a TWX msg message reporting the sighting of an unusual object from several widely scattered locations in Southern United States. A round object, about the size of a dime held at arms length with an irregular tail of 1/2°, was reported to have been seen from a five state area. Maxwell AFB, Alabama was requested via telephone to investigate the incident.

It was determined after a thorough investigation and analysis that the witness observed a large meteor at a very high altitude. This incident is comparable to the one reported from the Western United States in October 1957.

1. Reference telephone conversation 1 October 1958 between Colonel Leslie M. Norton, Chief, Intelligence Division, this headquarters and Major Robert J. Friend, ATIC-ABS, your headquarters.

2. The report transmitted by Captain directly to your headquarters has been investigated and is evaluated as completely reliable.

3. Supplementary reports attached to that of Captain were received through the facilities of Maxwell Flight Service. The reliability of these reports must be judged on the basis of the consistency in certain details and the professional competence of those who reported. The assessment here is that these reports tend to confirm one another, particularly as regards the time of observation and the description of the object observed.

4. The Unidentified Flying Object Report, transmitted by 2047 AACS Squadron, is therefore resubmitted, with the overall evaluation of reliable and credible.

estimated that this was caused by a change in attitude in flight, e.g. tumbling, etc. The object appeared to be traveling at about one fourth the speed of "shooting stars" or meters. It is the viewers opinion that it was a large vehicular object or missile re-entering the atmosphere.

ATTACHMENT TO UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

1. Report from Columbus, Mississippi radio (CAA) received 26/0424z:
Mr. [redacted] reported UFO moving southwest to northeast from the rear at 26/0252. Observer reported that object was not a falling star and further stated that he was sober at time of observation.

2. Report from Memphis Center (ATC) received 26/0440z: Huntsville and Muscle Shoals radios (CAA) both received calls reporting UFO seen trailing flame all moving from southwest to northeast or west to east. Eastern airline flight 366 en route from Memphis to Muscle Shoals reported sighting a meteor at the same time.

3. Report from Atlanta Center (ATC) received 26/0450z:

a. Delta airline flight 171 over Chattanooga at 26/0329z reported a light to the west moving from south to north, high and fast. The light seemed to blow up into a brighter light; did not appear to be a shooting star. This sighting was also observed by Delta airline flight 26X, Fulton tower (Atlanta) and Eastern airline's flight 389 on the ramp of Atlanta airport. (Delta 26X was northeast bound but exact location unknown.)

b. An off-duty CAP pilot in his automobile on Highway 78 about five miles east of Oxford (Mississippi, *c*), at 26/0330s saw a UFO headed north, stopped his car; heard roaring sound and observed fire flying from object, but did not observe any navigation lights.

c. Birmingham tower advised that Bill George, Alabama Air National Guard, in the traffic pattern at Birmingham in a T-33 at 2500 feet, saw a UFO pass directly over his aircraft at 3000 feet. The sighting was at 26/0330z. The object was traveling from west to east at 3000 feet. It was observed to be a fireball with a 90 foot tail. A watch tower supervisor at Center Point, Alabama also heard the noise and confirmed the report of a fireball with a 90 foot tail. A watch tower supervisor at Center Point, Alabama also heard the noise and confirmed the report of a fireball with a long tail.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Colonel Norton

SUBJECT:    UFOB

AT 0900, 1 October 1958, I received a telephone call from S.Sgt. 1st Class F. L. MaGill of the Security Office, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal (Phone: Jefferson 3411, ext. 422).

He reported that a Mr. _______ (name blacked out), Huntsville, Alabama, (employee of Redstone Arsenal in the Structure and Mechanics Lab) sighted an unidentified flying object between 2215 and 2230 local time on 25 September 1958 while standing outside of the Dwarf Restaurant facing S.W. He noticed a very bright light coming directly at him. The light appeared to get larger (about the size of a full moon). It stopped and made a right turn at a 90° angle. There were two smaller lights, about 1/50th the size of the large one, following the larger light. The lights were bullish-white in color. He reported the entire sequence of events lasted about seven seconds.
