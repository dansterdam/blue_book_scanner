1. Two objects were sighted emanating a bright blue-white light equal in intensity to a first magnitude star but only one-half or apparent diameter of same. The light varied in intensity but not at equal intervals as do the running lights of conventional aircraft. The two objects were maintaining the same altitude and course to the South. The objects were too far apart to be connected and they maintained the same distance from each other until shortly before the contact was lost when the near-most object appeared to swerve to the West. The apparent speed was slow and shortly before contact was lost local atmospheric interference causing the lights to seem to waver was encountered.

2. These objects were first sighted at 11:35 P.M. Central Daylight-Saving Time on 23 July 1952 and were observed for approximately nine minutes.

3. These objects were followed by the naked eye for approximately five minutes. A pair of 6 x 35 binoculars were then obtained and the observation continued for the remaining four minutes.

1. SOURCE stated that at approximately 2030 hours on 23 July 1952, he observed about five (5) unusual flying objects but due to the extremely high speed at which they traveled, it was very difficult to determine the shape and size of them. The first object which the SOURCE saw appeared to be a red (not bright red) in color. It seemed to fade to a dull white color, then in it moved further south it changed to a green color. It took about one (1) minute for the object to change from a dull white to green. At approximately 2034 hours the object appeared to be bright orange in color as it traveled at a high rate of speed, then the object remained in a stationary position throughout the entire sighting and for an unknown length of time after the SOURCE could observe all objects which he observed. The second, third, fourth and fifth objects all appeared to be white in color. A total of five (5) objects were observed; however, SOURCE was not sure whether he actually observed five (5) objects or the same object on each occasion. No particular formation was conducted by these objects. The aerodynamic features, if any, could not be determined and no trace of trail or exhaust was observed being emitted from the objects. The propulsion system could not be determined. The SOURCE stated that all objects, with the exception of the first object, traveled at an extremely high speed. No sound was heard being emitted from the objects.

The first object appeared in a northwest direction, traversed a clockwise direction, and disappeared in a southwest direction. The second object appeared also in a northwest direction, traversed in a clockwise direction, and disappeared in a northeast direction. The SOURCE stated previously that this object remained stationary throughout the entire sightings. The third object appeared in a north-northeast direction, traversed in a counter clockwise direction, and disappeared in a southwest direction.
