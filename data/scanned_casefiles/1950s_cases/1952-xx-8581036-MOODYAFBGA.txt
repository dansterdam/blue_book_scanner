1. The SOURCE stated that the first object was round, much smaller than a
star, white in color. Second object was round, same si.ze as a star, white in
color. The third object was round, biger then a star and constantly white in
color. Fourth object, SOURCE stated shape and size could not be determined,
but was also white in color. The shape and size of the fifth object also could
...nn be determined, but was also white in color . A total of five (5) flying ob-
jects were observed. No particular formation was held by these objects. The 
aerodynamic features, if any, could not be determined and no trace of trail or
exhaust was observed being emitted from the objects. The propulsion system
could not be determined. SOURCE stated that all of the objects traveled at an
extremly high speed. No sound was heard coming from any of the objects. The
FIRST Object appeared from a southerly direction. Altitude and distance un-
known. The object traversed toward a northwest direction for two (2) minutes
and disappeared. It did not change coloring. The second object appeared at
approximately 2031 hours in a northwest direction. Altitude and distance un-
known. The object traversed for about thirty (30) seconds in a southeast direc-
tion and disappeared. The third object appeared at about 2045 hours in a south
direction. Altitude and distance unknown. This object remained completely 
stationary throughout tho entire period of observation. (SOURCE stated that this 
object remained for an unknown length of time after tho afforcmentioncd and fol-
lowing objects disappeared). SOURCE departed after observing all but the above
mentioned object disappearing . While the object was stationary its coloring
would change constantly from blue to red. The fourth object appeared at 2100 
hours in a southerly direction. Altitude and distance unknown. The object 
traveled for approximately one (1) second toward a southerly direction and dis-
appeared. The fifth object appeared at about 2130 hours in a northwest direction.
altitude and distance unknown. The object tavaled south for ap);roximately one 
(1) second and disappeared. SOURCE stated that the outstanding feature of the 
entire sighting was the stationary object. H> other unusual features were ob-
served by the SOURCE; however, on ono (1) occasion, he stated that a white flash 
appeared between two (2) of the above objects but he could not elaborate or give

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1.  When being interviewed, the SOURCE had difficulty in expressing himself in regard to questions pertaining to the maneuvers of the objects.  There was doubt in his mind whether he actually observed five (5) individual objects or the same object on each occasion.  He could not give the altitude or distance of each object.

                                                                           ANTHONY                  A

1. According to the SOURCE, at approximately 2320 hours to 2323 hours on 23 July 1952, he observed one (1) unusual flying object which was round in shape and appeared to be a bright light. He estimated the size of the object to be approximately three and one half (3½) feet in diameter. The object was yellowish-white in color and maintained the same color throughout the entire period of the sighting. Only one (1) object was observed. The SOURCE could not determine the aerodynamic features of the object. No trail or exhaust was observed and the propulsion system could not be determined. SOURCE stated during the first interview that the speed of the object was approximately fifty (50) miles per hour. During the second interview he stated the speed of the object was about one hundred (100) miles per hour. No sound was heard coming from the object. SOURCE observed the object in a northeast direction at an altitude of about one (1) mile. The distance was estimated to be one (1) mile. The object traveled for about one (1) minute in a direct course toward the point of observation. Approximately one quarter (¼) a mile away from SOURCE and at an altitude of about two hundred (200) yards, the object ceased to travel abruptly and came to a very complete standstill for about one (1) minute. The object then rose in a vertical position at an extremely high speed for one (1) minute and disappeared. The color of the object faded as it disappeared. No other unusual features were observed by the SOURCE.

2. The above sighting was observed from approximately 2320 hours to 2323 hours (three (3) minutes) on 23 July 1952.

3. SOURCE observed the object visually.

1. According to the SOURCE, at approximately 2320 hours to 2323 hours on 
23 July 1952, he observed one (1) unusual flying object which was round in shape 
and appeared to be a bright light. He estimated the size of the object to be 
approximately three and one half (3 1/2) feet in diameter. The object was yellowish-
white in color and maintained the same color throughout the entire period of the 
sighting. Only one (l) object was observed. The SOURCE could not determine the 
aerodynamic features of the object. No trail or exhaust was observed and the 
propulsion system could not be determined. SOURCE stated during the first inter-
view that the speed of the object was approximately fifty (50) miles per hour. 
During the second interview he stated the speed of the object was about one 
hundred (100) miles per hour. No sound was heard coming from the object. SOURCE 
observed the object in a northeast direction at an altitude of about one (1) mile. 
The distance was estimated to be one (l) mile. The object traveled for about 
one (1) minute in a direct course toward the point of observation. Approximately 
one quarter (1/4) of a mile away from SOURCE and at an altitude of about two hundred 
(200) yards, the object ceased to travel abruptly and came to a very complete 
standstill for about one (l) minute. The object then rose in a vertical position 
at an extremely high speed for one (1) minute and disappeared. The color of the 
object faded as it disappeared. No other unusual features were observed by the 
SOURCE.

2. The above sighting was observed from approximately 2320 hours to 2323 
hours (three (3) minutes) on 23 July 1952.

3. SOURCE observed the object visually. 

4. Point of observation was approximately ten (10) feet directly in front 
of Aqua System No. 5, Moody AFB, Ga. The coordinates of Moody Air Force Base 
are as follows: Latitude: 30 58 N and Longitude: 83 09 W. The SOURCE estimated 
the distance of the object to be approximately one (1) mile and then one quarter 
(1/4) of a mile respectively approaching from a northeast direction and traveling 
in a southwest direction at an altitude of one (1) mile and two hundred (200) 
yards respectively.

5. The SOURCE is not a high school graduate. SOURCE is a graduate of the 
Air Force Air Police School. The SOURCE could not offer any additional information 
pertaining to his background knowledge and practical experience on which his 
reliability can be judged.

6. A check with the Moody Air Force Base Weather Station confirmed the 
weather conditions existing at the time of the sighting to be ceiling and visibili-
ity unlimited; winds aloft conditions unknown.

7. Negative.

8. Negative.

9. Negative.

10. Confirmation was received from a AACS Detachment stationed on this base 
that no aircraft based on this airfield were airborne in the general area of the 
sighting.

1. Two objects were sighted emanating a bright blue-white light equal in intensity to a first magnitude star but only one-half of apparent diameter of same. The light varied in intensity but not at equal intervals as do the running lights of conventional aircraft. The two objects were maintaining the same altitude and course to the South. The objects were too far apart to be connected and they maintained the same distance from each other until shortly before the contact was lost when the rear-most object appeared to swerve to the West. The apparent speed was slow and shortly before contact was lost moderate atmospheric interference causing the lights to seem to waver was encountered.

2. These objects were first sighted at 11:55 P.M. Central Daylight-Saving Time on 23 July 1952 and were observed for approximately nine minutes.

3. These objects were followed by the naked eye for approximately five minutes. A pair of 6 x 35 binoculars were then obtained and the observation continued for the remaining four minutes.

1. SOURCE stated that at approximately 2030 hours on 23 July 1952, he observed about five (5) unusual flying objects but due to the extremely high speed at which they traveled, it was very difficult to determine the shape and size of them. The first object which the SOURCE saw appeared to be red (not bright red) in color. It seemed to fade to a dull white color, then it moved further south it changed to a green color. It took about one (1) minute for the object to change from red to dull white and one (1) minute to change from dull white to green. At approximately 2034 hours the object appeared to be bright orange in color as it traversed directly above the SOURCE, then the object remained in a stationary position throughout the entire sighting and for an unknown length of time after the SOURCE observed the disappearing of all objects which he observed. The second, third, fourth and fifth objects all appeared to be white in color. A total of five (5) objects were observed; however, SOURCE was not sure whether he actually observed five (5) objects or the same object on each occasion. No particular formation was conducted by these objects. The aerodynamic features, if any, could not be determined and no trace of trail or exhaust was observed being emitted from the objects. Propulsion system could not be determined. The SOURCE stated that all. objects, with the exception of the stationary object, traveled at an extremely beautiful snack heard being emitted from the objects. The first object appeared in a northeast direction, traversed in a clockwise direction and disappeared in a southeast direction. The second object appeared also in northeast direction, traversed in a clockwise direction and disappeared in a southwest direction (SOURCE stated previously that this object remained stationary throughout the entire sighting). The third object appeared in a north-northeast direction, traversed in a counter clockwise direction and disappeared in a east-southeast direction. The fourth object appeared in a northeast direction, traversed in a clockwise direction and disappeared in a northwest direction. The fifth object appeared In a north-northeast direction, traversed in a counter clockwise direction and disappeared in a east southeast direction. The times, altitudes and distances of the above objects could not be determined by SOURCE. SOURCE stated that on one (1) occasion, a white flash appeared briefly near the left side of the first object. Also, on one (1) occasion, two (2) of the above objects seemed to meet at three (3) and nine (9) o'clock in their respective course but the SOURCE could not elaborate or give further details as to what particular objects they were. Further Information was unknown to SOURCE.

2. SOURCE observed the above objects from approximately 2630 hours to 2145 hours (one (1) hour and fifteen (15) minutes) on 23 July 1952.

3. SOURCE observed the objects visually.

4. The point of observation was directly in front of Building 439, 3550th Air Base Group Supply Room, Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. The coordinates of Moody Air Force Base are as follows: Latitude: 30 58 N; Longitude: 33 09 W. SOURCE observed the objects in a westerly direction and at an attitude (overall, (could not determined altitude or distance of each individual object) of approximately twenty thousand (20.000) feet.
