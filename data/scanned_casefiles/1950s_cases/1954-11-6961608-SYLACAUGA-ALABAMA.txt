METEOR INCIDENT
ATIC Case file and evaluation

SUMMARY:

On 30 November 1954 at approximately 1350 hrs, EST, an object crashed through the roof of the residence of Mrs. [redacted] Sylacauga, Alabama. Mrs. [redacted] was slightly injured during the incident.

The object was initially observed by many persons in the three state area of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. The object exploded at an estimated altitude of 45,000 to 50,000 ft; the largest and only fragment recovered was that piece which penetrated Mr. [redacted] residence.

The initial UFO teletype reports are designated as Attachment #1, of this case file.

AF FIELD RECOVERY AND REPORT:

Upon immediate notification of the incident to the Executive Officer at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, an air rescue helicopter (SA-16) piloted by Capt Rodgers was dispatched to Mr. [redacted]. Capt. Rodgers acquired the object and promised Mrs. [redacted] to return it after the AF had examined it. Mrs. [redacted] agreed to the arrangement.

Capt Rodgers returned the object to Maxwell AFB, where Dr. Frederick K. Morris of the Directory of Research Studies Institute tentatively identified the object was either a stone meteorite or an earthly periodotite.

On 1 December 1954, members of the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Flt 2-C arrived at Maxwell and interviewed Col. K.L. Atchley, District Commander, 8th Dist., OSI, Maxwell. After coordination with the Base Commander of Maxwell

Synopsis:
Investigation requested by Commander, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, as a result of unconfirmed reports of aerial explosions, alleged aircraft crashes and unidentified flying objects. One unidentified flying object falling through roof of house injuring occupant. Object obtained by Air Rescue aircraft, returned to station and examined by Geiger Counters with negative results. Flight Service Center received numerous reports of aircraft crashes, aerial explosions and flying objects in area where UFOB found. Air Defense Command informed of situation under provisions of AFR 200-2 and directed AISS Team to question persons with knowledge of reports of explosions and to obtain UFOB for transmission to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, for purpose of determining its origin. Considerable publicity resulted in object having been obtained by USAF. Guided Missile Expert advised UFOB not of similar substances used in his field of experiments. Geologist with Research Studies Institute advised that without complete examination of object, he could identify it only as "either a stone meteorite or an earthly periodotite". UFOB released to AISS Team. Husband of victim alleged to retain attorney.

Air Rescue Squadron presently had a helicopter in Sylacauga to obtain the object reported to have fallen in that area, and it was expected to return to Maxwell AFB at approximately 1715 hours.

6. At 1700 hours, 30 November 1954, the late edition of the Alabama Journal, a local newspaper, was screened for publicity concerning the cited reports. The following item was listed on the front page of said newspaper and is quoted verbatim below:

"PILOT REPORTS BLAST 60,000 FEET ABOVE MONTGOMERY"

"A pilot flying over Montgomery early this afternoon reported sighting of an explosion of an unidentified object over Montgomery, about 60,000 feet up."

"The object exploded about 1:30. The pilot was not identified."

"Meanwhile, a resident of the Cloverland area reported she saw an object, which she described as larger than a fireworks display, disintegrated before it hit the ground."

"Police said they did not have any report of the alleged explosion and the Highway Patrol reported that a search was on in the Sylacauga area for reported unidentified object which fell with a flash in an area north of Montgomery and southeast of Birmingham."

"Reports received here at 2 p.m. said what appeared to be an explosion was heard high over Sylacauga. An unidentified object fell through the roof of a home and injured a woman."

7. At 1730 hours, 30 November 1954, R. B. ROBERTS, Captain, 25792A, 48th Air Rescue Squadron, pilot of helicopter referred to previously, returned from Sylacauga, Alabama, and released to Special Agent ACHLEY the object which allegedly fell through the roof of a house in Sylacauga. The object was estimated to weigh approximately nine (9) pounds, and appeared to be of rock or metallic substance, and was of black or charcoal color. ROBERTS advised that he had obtained this object from Mayor EDWARD J. HOWARD and Chief of Police W. D. ASHCRAFT at Sylacauga, Alabama. ROBERTS stated ASHCRAFT informed him to the effect that Mrs. HEWLETT HODGES, Oak County, Commty, three (3) miles east of Sylacauga, had reported to him that between 1245 and 1300 hours, 30 November 1954, the object fell through the roof of her house while she was lying on the couch, and struck her on the body. ASHCRAFT stated to the best of his knowledge, the object was not known when he obtained it from Mrs. HODGES.

17. On 1 December 1954, LANZ and TENNILLE, accompanied by Special Agent ATCHLEY and the writer, interviewed Professor FREDERICK H. MORRIS, Geologist, Arctic-Desert-Tropic Information Center, Research Studies Institute, concerning the object. After considerable deliberation and examination of the object, Dr. MORRIS advised that due to present circumstances of urgency to Forward the object to Wright-Patterson AFB, he could identify it only as "either a stone meteorite or an earthly petrologic".

18. On 1 December 1954, JAMES G. PRATT, Colonel, Commander, Maxwell AFB, was briefed on all available information concerning the object by Special Agent ATCHLEY, M/Sgt. LANZ, M/Sgt. TENNILLE and the writer. At this time Colonel PRATT telephonically contacted the Operations Officer, 4602nd AISS, Ent AFB, Colorado, and requested that Headquarters to telephonically contact the Mayor of Sylacauga, Alabama, in an effort to satisfactorily explain the necessity for USAF examination of the object and thus avoid any publicity adverse to USAF concerning the method by which it was obtained from the Mayor of Sylacauga, Alabama. This step was taken in view of increasing publicity resulting from numerous and frequent protests made by Mr. HEWLETT HODGES concerning the USAF obtaining and withholding the object. It was determined from local newspapers that HODGES had this date obtained an attorney for the purpose of recovering the alleged meteorite from the USAF.

19. The following information from the Montgomery Advertiser, a newspaper of Montgomery, Alabama, and from the Birmingham Post-Herald, a Birmingham, Alabama newspaper, both of 1 December 1954, is quoted verbatim below:

"FRAGMENT OF METEORITE CRASHES SYLACAUGA HOME"

"SYLACAUGA, ALA., Nov. 30 (AF)— A meteorite crashed through the roof of a house here today and slightly injured Mrs. Hewlett Hodges, 32.

"George Swindle, field representative of the U.S. Geological Survey, tested the nine-pound object and identified it as a sulphide meteorite.

"A mysterious explosion in the Sylacauga area, set off a three-state search today in which 35 or 40 planes took part. But there were no planes reported missing.

"The explosion was seen as far south as Phenix City, on the Alabama-Georgia border.

"Dr. Walter B. Jones, Alabama state geologist, said evidently a meteor exploded in southeast Alabama, and Mrs. Hodges was hurt by a particle of it.

"Swindle, who is conducting a water survey in Sylacauga, said after he identified the meteorite, it was taken to Maxwell Air Force Base at Montgomery, 'where the Air Force is required to examine such strange objects'."

"Plunges Through Roof of House"
"METEORITE HITS SYLACAUGA WIFE"
3 States View Air Explosions
"Woman is First Person in History Known to be Struck by Sky Object"

"A large meteor exploded high in the heavens above Alabama yesterday afternoon and a piece of it fell through the roof of a Sylacauga house and bruised a 31-year-old housewife."

"Mrs. a plump, cheerful woman, was lying asleep on a sofa in her living room when she became the first person in history known to have been struck by a meteorite."

"The fragment, torn loose from the meteor by one of three terrific explosions of fire and smoke, smashed a three-foot wide hole in the roof of the Hodges' home."

"The meteorite, identified by experts as being of the sulphide variety, landed on Mrs. hip and 'made a big bruised place'."

"It also hit me on the hand and it swelled up', she said."

"Her hand still was swollen last night, and was turning blue-black and green."

"She said the bruises of her hip were even more colored."

"The object which struck Mrs. was identified as a meteorite (a meteor which strikes the ground) by George Swindle, field representative of the U.S. Geological Survey."

"The explosion which tore the meteor to bits happened at 12:45 p.m. and caused wild excitement not only in Sylacauga where everyone seemed to have been viewing the heavens, but also in other parts of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi."

"The explosion probably occurred some 40 miles up, but was heard over a wide distance and seen even further."

"A Birmingham man who saw the explosion but did not hear it, said a mushroomed-shaped cloud formed in the direction of Sylacauga from Birmingham and lasted for about 15 minutes before dissipating."

"Observers in Sylacauga could see the smoke but could not tell its shape since it was directly overhead."

"The piece which hit Mrs. was examined by Swindle on the scene. He happened to be in Sylacauga conducting a water survey."

"Swindle said Mayor Ed J. Howard has assured Dr. Jones the meteorite will be placed in the state museum at the University of Alabama when it is returned by the Air Force.

"Sylacauga police rushed to the Hodges home when the object crashed through the roof about 1 p. m.

"Mrs. [redacted] said she was lying on a couch in the living room of the frame house when the meteorite smashed a three-foot wide hole in the room and came tumbling through the ceiling.

"It hit our radio at one end of the couch and bounced off on me. It hit me on the arm and hip," she said.

"Police summoned a doctor when they arrived and Mrs. [redacted] was treated for bruises. She was reported in good condition tonight.

"We had a little excitement around here today," she told her husband when he came home from work.

"A meteorite fell through the roof."

"[redacted] is a tree surgeon and knew nothing of the incident until he came home from work tonight. He had been trimming trees for the telephone company.

"I don't believe I want to talk to anybody else for a while," said Mrs. [redacted]. "I'm kind of tired."

"[redacted] said his wife told him the house had been full of people all afternoon.

"She said there must have been several hundred," he added.

"[redacted] said he had no insurance on the house, and hadn't estimated the damage. He said the radio apparently was damaged extensively.

"Swindle said the meteorite was about six inches in diameter. He said the inside was a metalic, grey granular substance, which responded to tests given for sulphide. The outside coating was a black satin appearing substance.

"Dr. Jones said tonight he would welcome the meteorite, since the University museum does not have such an object from Alabama."

"A woman who lived directly across the street from the hole, Mrs. was in her Front yard planting shrubbery when the fragment fell.

"But I didn't hear anything', she said. 'I didn't even know anything had happened until somebody came out and told me about it.'

"Mrs. said she didn't hear anything either.

"She was asleep on a sofa in the living room, sleeping with her face toward the back of the sofa, her left hip up.

"When the meteorite hit her roof, it slanted across the room and struck her on the hip and injured her hand and arm which were lying on the hip.

"I woke up and thought the house was falling down', Mrs. said. 'I was in the next room sewing. She came running in and asked me if the house was falling down.

"I said I didn't know. I thought it was the chimney. I got up and started out of the house. Then my hip started hurting.

"I hadn't even seen the rock.'

"Then she and her mother found the hole in the roof and saw the 'rock' on the floor. They called the police.

"There wasn't any smell or anything to the rock,' said Mrs.

"Police Lt. W. T. Van Sandt, when he arrived, realized what must have happened and took the object to the police station where it was identified by the U. S. geologist.

"Van Sandt said that the object was cold to the touch when he arrived.

"Mrs. and her mother had not disturbed the meteorite.

"But her clothing was not scorched and she was not burned on the arm where it hit her.

"It's a good thing it didn't hit me in the head,' said Mrs. 'It might have killed me.'

"Mrs. thought at first the object had fallen atop a radio set in the corner and then bounced and hit her. The radio was damaged.

"But now I don't believe it did,' she said. 'The radio might have been hit by a piece of the ceiling or roof.'

"after he viewed it, an Air Force Captain in a helicopter landed in the small city 50 miles southeast of Birmingham and whisked the meteorite away to Maxwell Field at Montgomery.

"Swindle said Sylacauga Mayor Ed J. Howard gave assurances that the object will be placed in the State Museum of Natural History at the University of Alabama when it is returned by the Air Force.

"But Mrs. [redacted] husband, who didn't know about the incident until he got home from work early last night, was furious about the loss of the meteorite.

"I am going to demand that the Air Force return the stone to me', he said. 'They had no business taking it away in the first place.'

[Redacted] did not get to see the meteorite before it was flown away.

An employee of Bell Telephone Co., said he thought he could 'get enough evidence that the thing fell in my house.'

"The meteorite which hit Mrs. [redacted] weighed almost 10 pounds.

"Police Chief W. D. Ashcraft and other officers who handled it before it was turned over to the Air Force, said it was a metallic object, black and scorched-looking.

"Swindle, the geologist, said the meteorite was six inches in diameter. He said the inside was a metallic, gray granular substance which responded to tests given for sulphides.

"The outside coating was a black satin appearing substance.

"Besides striking Mrs. [redacted], the meteorite caused quite a stir in Sylacauga.

"Almost everyone in town saw the smoke which followed the explosion and a goodly number saw the explosion itself.

[Redacted], a country store operator and farmer, was outside his home when he heard the explosions.

"'First there was a loud boom', he said. 'Then in a few seconds there was another one and then a third'.

[Redacted] said after the first and second explosions, he located the direction of the noise and looked aloft and saw the third. There was a little fire and a lot of black smoke.

"He was about two miles from the Hodges house.

"Police summoned a doctor who took hrs. to his office and X-rayed her. He did not find any broken bones and sent her home.

"Her husband did not know of any of this until he arrived home from work.

"'We had a little excitement around here today', she told in a wifely fashion. 'A meteor fell through the roof'.

"The home is one of the oldest houses in the Sylacauga area. It is a rambling wooden house set among groves of old trees.

"'One witness to the explosion said that before it exploded, the meteor appeared to be a plane on fire.

"'It was a blaze of fire with a lot of smoke', said Miss, 22, a waitress at the DeSoto Grill near Sylacauga.

"'She was standing outside waiting for a bus with two other women.

"'One of them said to look at the plane on fire', Miss said. 'We looked and there it was.'

"Just at that moment, she said, it blew up in a blinding flash and a lot of noise.

"'It appeared to come out of the southeast.

"'Several other persons in Sylacauga thought it was a burning plane also, and a search with some 30 or 40 airplanes got under way shortly to look for the crash.

"'There were variances in the descriptions of the smoke from the explosions.

"'In Sylacauga, it appeared black.

"'In Birmingham and in other places at a distance, it appeared white.

"'There was immediate re-action to the meteorite story from over the nation.

"'Experts agreed unanimously that Mrs. was the first person known to have been struck by a meteorite.

"'Dr., amateur astronomer and registrar at Birmingham-Southern College, said he never had heard of it before.

"'Dr., head of the astronomy department at Agnes Scott College at Atlanta, said that the injury of was the first that he knew of that could be attributed to a meteor.

Here is the text from the document:

(Capt James E. Pratt) it was mutually agreed that the 4602nd should obtain the object in accordance with the provisions of AFR 230-2 (UFOB Reporting).

The object was returned to Flt 2-C headquarters located at Dobbins AFB, Georgia where arrangements for mailing it were initiated. A complete narrative report is listed as attachment #2 of this file.

ATIC ACTION:

On 2 December 1954, Captain Hardin, Chief, ATIAC-5, received a telephone call from Col. Dennison (Exec. Off. of the 48th Air Rescue Squadron, Maxwell). Col. Dennison stated that he was "under pressure" to return the object to Mrs. [redacted]. Capt. Hardin assured Col. Dennison that ATIC would not harm the original appearance of the object in any way during the examination. Capt Hardin suggested Col Dennison contact Mrs. [redacted] and reassure her the object would be returned to her as soon as possible.

As of 3 December 1954, the object had not been received at ATIC. Capt Hardin, ATIAC-5, placed a call to Flt 2-C of the 4602nd to inquire as to its status. Prior authorization for direct contact with a field unit had been obtained from Hq 4602nd AISS, Ent AFB, Colorado. Capt. Hardin was informed by 1st Lt Richard C. Vaughn, OCI, Flt 2-C, that he had encountered some difficulty in transporting the object to ATIC. He stated that he would send it immediately by First Class mail and register it.

On 6 December 1954, the object, encased in a wooden box was received at ATIC and signed for by T/Sgt Drepperd, ATIAC-5. The object was immediately examined visually by Dr. Robinson, ATIAC-5, whose evaluation is listed as attachment #3 of this file.

Here is the text from the document:

"Numerous astronomers state in books on the subject that no one ever has been struck.

"But the fragment which fell from the sky over Alabama yesterday is only one of billions which strike the earth's atmosphere each day.

"Most of them are tiny particles of sand-like material, remnants of lost worlds that exploded eons ago and swarm around the sun like gnats.

"Some are in regular orbits and when the earth passes through these meteor orbits, more are seen than normally.

"Only rarely does one last more than an instant of a second before being burned to a crisp by earth's atmosphere.

"The burning of the meteors is caused by their tremendous speed as they come into contact with the earth's atmosphere.

"Meteors generally start burning at about 100 miles up and burn out before they descend very far. If one is large enough to burn until it reaches an altitude of about 40 miles, it explodes in a manner similar to one which blew up over Sylacauga.

"The pieces then drift down over wide areas, hitting the ground at only moderate speeds because the air resistance slows them down.

"The fact that the Sylacauga meteor exploded at a tremendous height is substantiated by the fact that the explosion was seen from three states.

"It was seen at Phenix City and a wild report started there that the meteor was a flying saucer and that a woman saw a man get out of it.

"Guardsmen went out in planes, jeeps, ambulances and helicopters trying to find the object.

"But Guardsmen were unable to find anything, even though they scoured the area.

"The bright flash across the sky was reported simultaneously at Atlanta, Newnan and Columbus, Ga., several parts of Alabama, and as far west as Greenville, Miss.

"In Atlanta, the Air Force and State Patrol received several reports of a probable plane crash near Newnan, 40 miles southwest of Atlanta. Two patrol cars searched the area for two hours before calling off the search.

"Radio Station WOCH in Newman reported numerous calls from persons who said they saw a mysterious, flaming object in the sky.

"A Civil Aeronautics Admn. employee in Montgomery saw the falling meteor. He described it as a bright light like a falling star with a trail of smoke behind it" which fell across the horizon from a great height.

"A Maxwell Air Force pilot who was flying at high altitude also sighted it and gave a similar description.

"National Guard Sgt. Joe Clark of Elba was with the Guard in Phenix City. He said it appeared smaller than a plane.

"In Sylacauga, the descriptions of the explosions were as varied as the persons who heard it.

"To some, it was just loud 'boom, boom, booms'.

"Others heard small crackling noises and popping sounds between the big explosions.

"A Sylacauga city councilman, B. J. Phillips said it sounded like thunder to him. He was at home resting after lunch when the explosion occurred.

"Being the first person to be hit by a falling meteorite was of almost no moment to [redacted]. When asked how she felt about the dubious honor, she said: 'I feel bruised.'

"And what kind of a day was it?"

"It was a day when the stars fell on Alabama at last."

the object. Since AFR 200-2 outlines the disposition of UFOB matter
found, Col Pratt suggested we pick up object and proceed to Dobbins
AFB, Marietta, Georgia.

f. Col Atchley suggested that the object be examined by Dr. Frederick
K. Morris of the Directory of Research Studies Institute, Arctic,
Desert and Tropic Information Center at Maxwell AFB. Dr. Morris
stated that he was equipped for scientific analysis of object, if
requested. He believed that its composition was either a stone
meteorite or an earthly periodite. Furthermore, he suggested that
the Smithsonian Institute at Washington, D. C. (GEORGE: GHQ 5856)
would be interested in its study.

9. At 1/2330Z team departed IAFS and arrived at Flight Headquarters at 2/0500Z

10. Investigators' Comments:
Because of events related in par 8e, it was decided by the team not to
visit Mrs. [redacted] immediately but to return to DAFB, Marietta, Georgia for quick
transfer of object to ATIC. If, however, it is deemed necessary, Mrs. [redacted]
can be interviewed by Flight 2-G.

Regarding object and source of origin, the following opinions were
reached. From opinions given by sources considered reliable, it is believed that an
object of similar size, weight and shape, travelling at the high speed normally
attributed to a meteorite, would have smashed through the floor and buried itself
deep into the earth. Instead, it merely penetrated the roof and ceiling, hits Mrs.
[redacted] and dropped on floor according to hrs. [redacted] to newspapers (Ref incl
# 3). Object was forwarded to ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio for further analysis.

On 6 December 1954, Capt. Hardin placed to Col Bloomer, APOIN-X, and informed him that the object was being examined at ATIC. Col. Bloomer stated he had received a Congressional inquiry on the matter as well as requests for press releases. Col. Bloomer also stated that the Smithsonian Institute (Wash DC) would like to examine the object. He recommended that Capt Hardin contact Mr. Henderson of the Institute relative to the matter. On the same date, Capt. Hardin received a telegram from the Mrs [redacted] owner of the meteorite. This message is entered into this file as attachment #4.

On 7 December 1954, T/Sgt Drepperd placed a call to Mr. Henderson of the Smithsonian. Mr. Henderson agreed there is no question of who is the rightful owner, however, any type of meteorite is considered of national scientific value, and the National Museum (Smithsonian) should have an opportunity to examine it. Mr. Henderson further stated that, if possible, they would inform Mrs [redacted] of the true monetary value of the meteorite. T/Sgt. Drepperd recommended that Mr. Henderson contact Col. Bloomer to make arrangements for acquisition of the meteorite from the A.F.

Shortly after the above mentioned phone conversation, Col Bloomer called Capt Hardin and informed him that a suitable agreement had been accomplished between the Smithsonian and Mrs [redacted] Congressional Representative. Plans called for the AF to release the meteorite to the Congressman, who in turn would loan it to the Smithsonian for study. Col Bloomer then requested the meteorite to be forwarded to APOIN-X. Col Bloomer also requested a short report of ATIC's analysis for press release, information.

The meteorite was crated in the same wooden box it was received in and air mailed at 1200 hrs to Col Bloomer. (Col Bloomer acknowledged receipt via telephone at 100 hrs, 8 Dec 54).

ATIC PRELIMINARY EVALUATION                                   2 December 1954

The UFO which struck the house in Sylacauga, Alabama on 30 Nov 54 was definitely a meteorite, very probably a member of the Andromedid Shower always observed with varying degrees of prominence from Nov. 24 to Dec. 7. Great displays of them were observed in 1872 and 1885 when many people thought "the world was coming to an end." The Andromedid comet should have reappeared. The great showers of 1872 and 1885 occurred when the comet broke into two parts in 1846 and disappeared after 1952. The meteors ordinarily are slow and leave long trails, but their speeds depend upon what part of the day, or night they are seen; and it is possible to see members of the shower almost any time of the night. Only the larger ones, however, could register their occurrence by an explosion during the daylight hours. Some are seen every year because the debris of the comet has been strewn along the whole path of the comet and the earth in its motion around the sun crosses the path of the comet on Nov 27 each year.

JOINT MESSAGEFORM

ROUTING: COMDR ATIC
TO: D/I HQ USAF WASH D C
INFO:

FOR POLICY AND MANAGEMENT GROUP

FROM APOIN-ATIAB JR 707E

The Alabama meteorite is made up of dense stony matter with many grains of nickel-iron alloys (aerolite type meteorite). The outer portion of the meteorite is blackened showing evidence of heat erosion from friction with the earth's atmosphere. The original meteorite was much larger than the part recovered since it was seen to explode from Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. Some other fragments distributed over a very large area remain to be recovered, and much of it must have fallen as ashes. The speed of the meteorite when it entered the earth's atmosphere was probably in excess of 15 miles per second. Evidence indicates that the Alabama meteorite was a member of the Andromid shower, occurring between 24 November and 7 December. These generally come from the north as in this case. If it is from this shower, it is from the debris of Biela's comet which disappeared after 1852. Fragments from this comet have fallen for centuries.

The document is a Joint Messageform dated 062045Z DEC 54, marked UNCLASSIFIED, with routing from COMDR ATIC to D/I HQ USAF WASH D C, discussing details about the Alabama meteorite.

On 7 December 1954, ATIC-5 was visited by Dr. Taylor and Mr. Castillo from the C & N Laboratory, WADC. They visually examined the meteorite and agreed with Dr. Robinson's original evaluation. Mr. Castillo stated he has been monitoring effects of ionospheric propagation on HF radio signals through an oscilloscope for the past two years. He has been especially interested in the returns he has been receiving from meteorite trails. He continued that during the month of November, 1954, there had been a mark increase in the meteorite activity. The attached photograph is one that he obtained on the night of 21 Oct 1954 which vividly depicts a fair size return of a meteorite trail. Mr. Castillo operates station WW in Springfield, Ohio. He concluded that during the week of the Alabama incident, he received unusual amounts of meteorite returns on his graph.

One set of the meteorite photographs were given to Dr. Taylor upon his request.

1. Reference report AF Form 112, F-2-UFOB-1, dated 2 December 1954, from Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia. Enclosed for your retention are two duplicate sets of prints of the Sylacauga, Alabama unidentified flying object. The object was photographed on 6 December 1954 at the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

2. The object was received at the Air Technical Intelligence Center 1000 hours on 6 December 1954 and was forwarded to AFOIN-X at 1200 hours 3 December 1954, where it has been loaned to the Smithsonian Institute for additional study.

3. The following is the preliminary analysis of the object by ATIC; the final evaluation is pending the results of the Smithsonian Institute's examination:

    a. Meteors and meteorites may be divided roughly into three classes. One class is almost completely metallic (iron, nickel, etc.). Another is largely stony; and another, members of which are frequently called aerolites, is composed of dense stony matter with many grains of nickel-iron alloys. This meteorite (from Alabama) appears to be an aerolite, weighing 4 pounds, 8 ounces.

    b. Explosions of very large meteors are quite frequent. Most meteors are no larger than the head of a pin, and these burn up miles above the earth. On account of the heat generated, the larger meteors moving with high speeds must therefore explode. The Alabama meteor was much larger than the smaller part recovered, for it was seen to explode. Some other fragments distributed over a very large area remain to be recovered, and much of it must have fallen as ashes.

    c. The average limits of altitudes of meteor paths are known. They seldom appear at greater heights than 90 miles, for at greater heights the insulating air is insufficient to cause one to burn, and generally they burn up before getting as low as 40 miles. Only those large

enough to penetrate all the earth's atmosphere actually hit the earth; and these are called "meteorites." Velocity of a meteor plays an important part on whether or not it hits the earth. At the time a meteor hits the earth's atmosphere--100 miles high, say--its velocity will range between 9 miles per second and 44 miles per second. Since the earth's motion around the sun gives it a velocity of 18 miles per second and the average velocity of a meteor is 26 miles per second, one therefore finds velocities between 26-18 and 26+18 miles per second.

d. The speed of the Alabama meteorite can be estimated only if one knows the exact direction from which it came and the time of the day it fell. The evidence seems to indicate, however, that the Alabama meteorite was a member of the Andromedid shower, occurring between November 24 and December 7. These come from the north, but the exact direction depends on the time of day they are seen. Ordinarily their speeds are about 15 miles per second, but this figure may be either higher or lower. If it is a member of this shower, it is from the debris of Biela's comet which disappeared after 1852. Fragments from this comet have been falling, however, for centuries--one of the earliest perhaps being a stone weighing 260 pounds which fell in Alsace, November 16, 1492, between 11 and 12 A.M.

4. Arrangements have been made for the meteorite to be returned directly to its owner from the Smithsonian Institute.
