UFOB INDEX CARD
1. DATE: 3 March 1955
2. LOCATION: Charleston, West Virginia
3. DESCRIBING OBJECT: One (1) round, very tight object, the size of a balloon, at a distance estimated at three-five (3-5) seconds

6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Three 20 (plus or minus 5) seconds
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One (1)
9. COURSE: Stationary
11. COMMENTS: Due to the brevity of the sighting and the impossibility of determining the course or duration of the lighting observation, no estimation was made of velocity, height, distance, or size. The sighted object had all the characteristics of a balloon. A check with the local weather station indicated weather conditions at 2030 EST, 3 March 1955, were conducive to balloon sighting. Possibly UR-16 minutes prior to the sighting.
