Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Most of the text in the body of the document is too illegible to read clearly. There are some fragments of text visible, but not enough to confidently transcribe full sentences.]

At the top right of the document, there are some handwritten markings that appear to say "2 letters" and "3 citations" and what looks like a number, but these are also partially illegible.

The document appears to be a partially obscured or poorly scanned page from a report, with significant portions of the text being unreadable.

In 1955 of about a dozen photos of UFOs two in particular stood out among the rest. On March 9 an amateur astronomer friend of mine, Mr. [redacted], also an active UFO researcher, photographed a round luminous object near the edge of the Moon from Broadway, Virginia.

9. COURSE: Stationary

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
One (1) round, very bright object, the size of a softball held at arm's length, was noticed in the sky at a distance estimated at three-five miles. The object appeared "fuzzy" at times and seemed to have no distinct areas as any line. Observer states the object swerved to miss a cloud. Time of day: dusk.

11. COMMENTS:
Due to the brevity of the sighting and the improbability of further investigation yielding significant data, no investigation authorized by this organization (USAF). The object has all the characteristics of a balloon. A check with the local weather station revealed that a balloon was released at 06/210Z Mar 55, thirty-six (36) minutes prior to the sighting.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
- Probably Balloon
- Possibly Balloon
