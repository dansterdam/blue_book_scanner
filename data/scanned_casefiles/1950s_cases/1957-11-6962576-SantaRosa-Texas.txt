On the right side of the document, there are some additional handwritten notes:

24600
1-244
2-5420
3-4x20

There is also a partially legible handwritten note that appears to start with "City" but the rest is not clearly readable.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

HEADQUARTERS AIR TECHNICAL CENTER
DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE USAF

this object was sighted short hours and still detail
disappears yet cannot identify.

[Handwritten notes and diagrams are present, including:
- A sketch with arrows and directional markings
- The word "GARBELD" (possibly misspelled "GARBLED")
- A note "Typical GOC Report" at the bottom of the page]

Some text appears to be obscured or illegible due to the document's condition and scanning quality. The document appears to be a UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book, dated 1957, located in Santa Rosa, Texas.
