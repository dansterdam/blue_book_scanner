7/very bright lights on the bottom.
7) 23/0424 Low flying obj. sighted by civilian 11 miles S of Loring AFB. Jets scrambled byt only obj. observed was a star.
8) At 23/0600Z Radar sighting of two objs. sighted by the woman & airman at Presque Isle (0530E). Radar determined alt as less than 15,000ft. One sped North at 350-500 kts.

Summary: Some of the sightings indicate that a balloon was the cause. The winds were fm the West & SW. Location of the rpts at the various times indicate a flight to the NE if the same obj. can be attributed as causing the rpts. Radar rpts had a maximum height of 26,000 rpts & the duration in the area fm the 1st rpt to the last is excessive for a balloon. However if there was a leak in the balloon its speed & rate of rising would be diminished. Balloons are difficult to spot in some cloud conditions at the speeds attained by F-102's & it is likely that the pilots would fail to find. 2-KG 135's & 2 B-52's were in the area at the time. No rpt on the disappearance of the objs except that the radar was due to fading. No conclusion is attempted. Case considered as insufficient data.
