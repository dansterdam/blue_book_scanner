v/very bright lights on the bottom.
7) 23/00032 Lv: sighting obj sighted by civilian 11 miles S of Loring AFB. Jets scrambled but only obj observed was star.
8) 23/00002 Lv: sighting of two obj sighted by the woman & airman at Presque Isle - (05302): radar determined alt as less than 15,000ft. One sped North at 595-595 knots.
Summary: Some of the sightings indicate that a balloon was the cause. The winds were 20-25m/s Loring. The cause of the sightings times indicates a flight to the NE if the same obj can be attributed as a cause. Radar reports had maximum alt of 35,000 and a duration in the light report to the 5 hr. Radar reports had to last over 1 hr. The balloon is dear in the sightings & rate of rise would be undetermined. Balloons are difficult to track & some would undoubtedly be mistaken. Conditions at the scene would make identification difficult. Pilots would fail to identify balloon & 2 GCI 135's & 2 B-52's were in the area at the time. GCI was unable to intercept the radar was due to fading. No conclusion is attempted. Case considered as insufficient data.
