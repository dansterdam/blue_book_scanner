FLYING SAUCER OBSERVED OVER SWEDEN

Stockholm, Swedish Home Service, Dec. 17, 1953, 2115 GMT--L

(Text)

"The unknown object observed this afternoon in the air in the neighborhood of Hassleholn was spherical and robot-like" Captain [redacted] of the Trans Air Sweden Company told the Swedish telegraph service tonight.

It was [redacted] who first sighted the strange object described by the Defense Staff in a communique this evening. The object was also observed by his mechanic, Ole Johansson.

"It was something new I saw. Of that there is no doubt," said [redacted] who served in the RAF during the war and made about 30 raids from North Africa and Italy. "Suddenly, on my right, I saw something which I first thought was a jet plane. It was a narrow silhouette approaching with tremendous speed. I immediately warned my only passenger, Johansson, the mechanic. I had only four seconds in which to make my observations, when the strange body came nearer I could see it was a metallic, silvery thing, perfectly symmetrical. It was definitely not a meteor or other celestial body. It proceeded below our aircraft without leaving any trade of gas or condensation. It was above the mist at a height of 1,600 meters at the most.

"Then I had seen the thing for about four seconds it disappeared under the nose of our plane. But the mechanic who had a better downward and rear view, could follow it for a further five seconds," Captain [redacted] concluded.

It was erroneously reported in our 1800 news bulletin that the object was observed for six to seven minutes. It should have been six to seven seconds.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From (Country)    Oeira, Stockholm, Sweden    TR-12    PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

1. On Thursday, 17 December 1953, while flying near Hassleholm, Sweden, Captain sighted an "unknown" object. The following is the translation of a newspaper account of the incident:

"The chief pilot of Transair, Capt. Ulf Christernsson, and his crew chief, Olle Johansson, had a strange meeting over Hassleholm at 14:37 hours Thursday. A shining metal spherical elliptical object came toward them traveling in the opposite direction from their machine at an estimated speed of sound and approximately 600 meters below their DC-3, which was on its way from Billkofta to Bromma. It was visible six to seven seconds," Capt. Christernsson, who had good silhouette recognition, stated that what he saw was a "completely new, probably an unnamed robot."

"The Transair plane was automatic controls when the meeting occurred. Capt. Christernsson did not have time for any measures other than to report to Bulltofta and the Defense Staff, which later sent out the following communique:

"The air crew of a civil aircraft observed on Thursday at 14:37 hours over the area of Hassleholm an unknown object moving in the opposite direction and at the same time and altitude the weather was clear. Because of the low lying cloud formation the object is not thought to have been from the ground. The Defense Staff does not know of any Swedish plane that was in that area at the time in question. An investigation is being conducted."

"Previously I have been extremely skeptical about all the stories of mysterious objects -- called flying saucers -- that have been at diverse points, said the Captain. Now I don't know exactly what to think, but it did seem to me that we had seen a robot of some kind. When I first caught sight of the object, which lies as was in the civil air border, I thought it was a jet. We had, however, received no word that any such thing was on the way.

"The object came toward us at what I would say was the speed of sound; we were flying at an altitude of approximately 2,150 meters and the object was around 600 meters below us. It was going in a northwesterly direction and disappeared after six or seven seconds.

"The object had a strong metal shine; the crew chief, Johansson, who could see it longer than I, thought it was almost photographic. The flying weather was excellent above the clouds, which were at an altitude of about 1500 meters, and the sun was shining brightly, just above the clouds.

"The first silhouette I got diagonally from the right was narrow. Then it was nearly directly under us, and now I can say it was nearly round, just slightly elliptical.

"The object, which could definitely not have been a meteor, gave off no waste gases or condensation traces.

"Was I afraid? No, but curious, very curious," concluded Captain Christernsson.

"Christernsson has seen just about everything in aviation and has very good silhouette recognition. From 1942 to 1946 he was a volunteer serving in

the Royal Air Force. He finished as a captain in the British Air Force, after
making some thirty raids in a Mosquito against enemy territory, in both North
Africa and Italy.

"Air Force Chief, General Nordenskiöld, announced that it had been ascertained that the object could not have been any Swedish aircraft."

"We are now investigating," he continued, "what our radar stations might
have spotted."

part of Sweden, an extremely reliable source in the Royal Swedish Air Force, who was
born in the same town and who is a life-long acquaintance of Capt. [Air Board], who
has stated that [he] is a most charming and well-liked, but that he is also most untrustworthy and was dismissed from a former position for "financial difficulties," having the last war.

This office is attempting to obtain further information on the occurrence.

19 DECEMBER 1953

IS THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT SEEN IN THE SKY OF SWEDEN
A SOVIET MISSILE OR A RADIO-GUIDED AIRCRAFT?

Stockholm, 18.

[Several names are blacked out] and his mechanic [name blacked out] who saw yesterday the mysterious missile in the sky of Sweden, have concordantly declared that the object they have seen was an absolutely new and unknown device more similar to a "flying pill" than to a "flying saucer."

[Name blacked out] said "I was sitting in the right seat of the DC-3 cockpit and could see the missile for approximately 10 seconds. It was entirely of metal, and seemed absolutely symmetrical of circular or elliptic shape. It had a light color between silver and white; no smoke or flames were visible."

[Rest of document continues with details about the sighting, radar tracking, and Swedish military investigation]

The document appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report about a UFO sighting in Sweden on 19 December 1953, discussing whether the object was a Soviet missile or radio-guided aircraft.

Night newspapers and particularly the [illegible] affirm that the "rotating disc" proceeded at 2,150 meter altitude over [illegible] in the province of Scania. The "disc" was also deniers that probably the unidentified objects are "aerial projectiles" which, departing from the Baltic coast and proceeding at a sonic speed, follow an elliptical path over Southern Sweden and Denmark and land in East Germany.

According to "expression," on the contrary, the objects would be a "radio-guided reconnaissance instruments provided with television cameras."
