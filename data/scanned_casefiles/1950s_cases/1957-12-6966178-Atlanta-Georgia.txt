INFORMATION: (1) Unlimited (a) 15 miles (b) None (c) Clear, bright night (b) Unknown
(11) Assist Base Operations Officer, Planet Venus at 22d6 degrees, 2-5 degrees elev.
during time of sighting. Area of normal flight patterns of local traffic. Total
absence of sound in isolated rural area rules against a/c landing lights. Position
of light and duration of sighting point to setting Planet Venus. Planet would have
been visible above horizon at approx time of disappearance of UFOB. Observers stated
to have "supernatural brilliance", however, visibility at time of sighting and
possible atmosphere refraction would tend to negate normal brilliance of Venus.
(12) None. Mr Allen searched area during daylight hours on 23 Dec 57 without finding
and observing any evidence.
