10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Regular target (radar sighting) but
larger than ordinary radar target.
Fast acceleration of speed. Was able
to make 180 dgr turn in less than 
6 seconds. Increased and decreased 
speed in a matter of seconds. All
other traffic accounted for.

11. COMMENTS
Insufficient data for analysis.
Altitude not reported.
