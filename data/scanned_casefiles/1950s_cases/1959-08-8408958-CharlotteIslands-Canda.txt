Ltr, 92 BW (DCOI), Subject: (U) Unidentified Flying Object

2. The aircraft on which the radar operator was Captain Wolter was not in the same formation as the other aircraft. This crew was in another three ship cell but their beacon sighting was approximately the same area only about an hour later. Captain Wolter was on a heading of 152° (Magnetic Heading) when he spotted the beacon return on his radar scope (see statement). He also spotted returns a short time later on his scope, and his gunner saw what he believed were ordinary aircraft lights in the same location as the radar target. No coordinates are available for these latter sightings. Apparently the other ships in this formation did not observe any unidentified objects. The aircraft in which Captain Wolter was flying was the tail end ship in the formation. (U)

3. The statements of the crew members, the radar film and the photo log are inclosed as requested. (U)

STATEMENT

"At point "Seirra" I heard a report over UHF Interplane of a sighting of aircraft at 0600 Z. I then switched my set to 20,000 yard range and picked up an unidentified return at 12,500 yards. During that time I also had very good returns of the aircraft in our formation, the farthest of which was NO. -3 which was 4,000 yards range.

This unidentified target stayed with us approximately 30 minutes and was 30° below our aircraft.

The coordinates of this sighting are 50:15 - 130:39.

The unidentified object finally broke right and disappeared from my scope at 18,000 yards and 60° azimuth."

STATEMENT

"At approximately 0545 Sulu and just prior to Ft. # 14A of the Steeltrap route, I was station-keeping on the lead aircraft of the three ship cell. I noticed a small #1 return to the rear at 4100 azimuth, range about 1 NM. I notified the pilot, who queried the gunner. The gunner stated that the object first ascended, then descended, finally disappearing to our right.

For the next hour or so, I had continued intermittent returns in the altitude hole, always at a mile or two range, and azimuths from 3:00 to 9:00. Later observation of them led me to believe they were some sort of "mirrored" returns; i.e., a reflection of the other aircraft. I took 0-15 film of this phenomena, starting at 0611 Z. Refer to Line # 6 of Camera Log for A/C 6-660, 28 Aug 59, Mission # 431-2. No further visual sightings were made."

STATEMENT

"On "Steel Trap" mission # 435-ST-6 flown on 28-29 August 1959, I sighted the following phenomena.

These observations were all witnessed by Lt H.L. Bookelman, Capt. C. Miosi, Capt. R. C. Davis, Capt. S. Phillips and SSgt. J. Tay.

Approaching the coast for the 1st AR I, Captain C. T. Wolter radar operator on Crew R-92 picked up a beacon 65 miles in front of our aircraft. The beacon appeared to approach us at a fast speed passing under us in about 40 seconds.

After completing AR and going North from the TP I picked up numerous objects on the radar scope in the altitude hole. At times there were two and then again three moving at a very fast rate of speed. Several times they followed behind the formation and lights were observed. Also, at times a beacon type return was observed."

STATEMENT

"At about 0545 Z the pilot called me to take a look out at 5 o'clock to see if I saw an aircraft. I did and saw it and it was not part of our formation. It had a rotating beacon but no Rec. lights nor Nav. lights. After I sighted it, it ascended and then descended to the right of our formation out of sight. I also picked the return up on my radar at about 4 o'clock in AZ. and at 3000 to 4000 yards. At 0800 Z Blue Lead tail gunner picked the target up at 12,000 yards in long range, then I switched to long range and pick it up at 8,000 yards, at 6 o'clock AZ.

STATEMENT

"At approximately 0540 Z I was notified by my Radar Operator reported a return 2 miles behind us in the # 3 position of a 3 ship cell. My gunner sighted what appeared to be a rotating beacon at 5 oclock low and after about 10 minutes it descended and was lost. A check with "Consort" control revealed no reported traffic in the area.

After about 30 minutes we had another return in the same position and for a period of 30 minutes it was intermittant. No visual contact was made but our tail radar and a return at 8,000 yards for a few minutes.

All ground stations reported no traffic or sightings."

Memo, AFCIN-484g, 29 Sep 59, (U) Unidentified Flying Object

1st Ind (AFCIN-481a)/Mr. Picklesimer/74201/jc)                   21 Oct 59

TO: AFCIN-484g

1. Analysis of attached radarscope film has been accomplished with the following results:

    a. The blips on the film are not different from ordinary radar blips, hence no particular type of "target" or flying object is indicated.

    b. A few still photographs of a radar indicator do not give the viewer as good an insight as to what actually occurred as the live radar picture gives to the radar operator at the time of the sighting of the objects.

2. This office agrees with the proposed explanation that some type of aircraft possibly caused the radar returns.

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Object

22 SEP 1959

TO: ATIC, Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. In answer to your unclassified message AFOIN 4E 9-18608, dated
11 September 1959, the following information is submitted. (U)

a. Aircraft were flying a cell of three aircraft in trail forma-
tion. About 1 mile separated each plane. (U)

b. The distance between the object and the aircraft varied from
one to five miles. (U)

c. The rotating beacon was red. According to the gunner who
witnessed the beacon visually, it was on an aircraft that had neither
recognition nor navigation lights and in this gunner's opinion the air-
craft appeared to be somewhat smaller than a B-52. No other details
could be seen. (U)

d. It was determined that the beacon was in the same general
location as the radar target. (U)

e. The beacon appeared to stay about the same brightness and size
while it was observed. (U)

f. The beacon was viewed continuously (visually) without a break
for about 10 or 12 minutes. (U)

g. The heading reported in the original report was not a magnetic
heading. The magnetic heading was 152°. There was 10° left drift and
the variation was -25°. (U)

h. Aircraft did not vary course any time except at regularly
scheduled turning points. (U)

i. The ceiling and visibility reported was for the area of the
sighting. (U)

j. The radar targets did close on the aircraft. The distance
varied from five miles to about one mile. When the distance was with-
in one mile the targets left the scope. (U)
