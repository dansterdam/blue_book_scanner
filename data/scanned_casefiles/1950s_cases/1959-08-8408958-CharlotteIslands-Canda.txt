2. The aircraft on which the radar operator was Captain Wolter was not in the same formation as the other ships, and their beacon sighting was in approximately a bearing of 1029 (Maanetio Beafing) when he picked up the beacon return on his radar scope (see statement), and his gunner saw what he believed were contrails of this object. No other ships in this formation observed this object on their radar. The other ships in this formation did not observe any unidentified objects. The aircraft in which Captain Wolter was the tail end ship in the formation. (U)

Text transcribed from the document:

STATEMENT

"At point "Seirra" I heard a report over UHF interplane of a sighting of aircraft at 0800 Z. I then switched my set to 20,000 yard range and picked up an unidentified return at 12,300 yards. During that time I also had very good returns of the aircraft in our formation, the farthest of which was NO.-3 which was 4,000 yards range.

This unidentified target stayed with us approximately 30 minutes and was 30° below our aircraft.

The coordinates of this sighting are 50:15 - 130:39.
The unidentified object finally broke right and disappeared from my scope at 18,000 yards and 60° azimuth."

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document detailing a statement from an individual named Jack R. Walser regarding a UFO sighting.

STATEMENT
"At approximately 0545 Sulu and just prior to PT # 14A of the Steeltrap route, I was station-keeping on the land aircraft of the three ship cell. I noticed a small #1 return to the rear at 4:00 azimuth, range about 1 NM. I notified the pilot, who queried the gunner. The gunner stated that the object first ascended, then descended, finally disappearing to our right.
For the next hour or so, I had continued intermittent returns in the altitude hole, always at a mile or two range, and azimuths from 3:00 to 9:00. Later observation of them led me to believe they were some sort of "mirrored" returns, i.e., a reflection of the other aircraft. I took C-18 film of this phenomena, starting at 0611 Z. Refer to Line # 6 of Camera Log for A/C G-600, 28 Aug 59, Mission # 431-29. No further visual sightings were made."

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States. 

The text in the document is as follows:

STATEMENT

"On 'Steel Trap' mission # 435-ST-6 flown on 28-29 August 1959, I sighted the following phenomena.

These observations were all witnessed by Lt H.L. Bookelman, Capt. C. Elsis, Capt. R. C. Davis, Capt. S. Phillips and SSgt. J. Tray.

Approaching the coast of Canada for the let AK I, Capt. C. T. Welter, radar operator on Crew R-92 picked up a beacon 65 miles in front of our aircraft. The beacon appeared to approach us at a fast speed passing under us in about 40 seconds.

After completing AR and going North from the TI I picked up numerous objects on the radar scope in the altitude hole. At times there were two and then again three moving at a very fast rate of speed. Several times they followed behind the formation and lights were observed. Also, at times a beacon type return was observed."

STATEMENT
"At about 0545 Z the pilot called me to take a look out at 6 o'clock to see if I saw an aircraft. I did and saw it and it was not part of our formation. It had a rotating beacon but no nose lights nor tail lights. After I sighted it, it descended and then descended to the right of our formation out of sight. I also picked the return up on my radar at about 4 o'clock in Az. and at 3000 to 4000 yards. At 0600 Z Blue Lead tail gunner picked the target up at 12,000 yards in long range, then I switched to long range and pick it up at 5,000 yards. at 6 o'clock Az.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typewritten document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, the US Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying objects.

STATEMENT
"At approximately 0540 Z I was notified by my Radar Operator reported a return 2 miles behind us in the # 3 position of a 3 ship cell. My gunner sighted what appeared to be a rotating beacon at 5 o'clock low and after about 10 minutes it descended and was lost. A check with "Consort" control revealed no reported traffic in the area.
After about 30 minutes we had another return in the same position for a period of 20 minutes it was intermittent. No visual contact was made but our tail radar had a return at 8,000 yards for a few minutes.
All ground stations reported no traffic or sightings."

1st Ind (AFCIN-4e5a/Ur. Pickeisimer/74201/JC) 21 Oct 59

1. Analysis of attached radarscope film has been accomplished with the following results:
a. The blips on the film are not different from ordinary radar blips, hence no particular type of "target" or flying object is indicated.
b. A few still photographs of a radar indicator do not give the viewer as good an insight as to what actually occurred as the live radar picture gives to the radar operator at the time of the sighting of the object.

2. This office agrees with the proposed explanation that some type of aircraft possibly caused the radar return.

ATTN OF: DCOI

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Object

TO: ATIC, Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. In answer to your unclassified message AGIN 4E 9-1350E, dated 11 September 1959, the following is submitted:
a. Aircraft were flying a call of three aircraft in trail formation. About 1 mile separated each plane. (U)
b. The distance between the object and the aircraft varied from one to five miles. (U)
c. The rotating beacon was red. According to the gunner who witnessed the beacon visually, it was on an aircraft that had neither navigation lights nor anti-collision lights and in this gunner's opinion there was no other aircraft that could be seen. (U)
d. It was determined that the beacon was in the same general location as the radar targets. (U)
e. The beacon appeared to stay about the same brightness and size while it was observed. (U)
f. The beacon was viewed continuously (visually) without a break for about 10 or 12 minutes. (U)
g. The heading reported in the original report was not a magnetic heading. The magnetic heading was 162°. There was 100 knot drift and the variation was -25°. (U)
h. Aircraft did not vary course at any time except at regularly scheduled turning points. (U)
i. The ceiling and visibility reported was for the area of the sighting. (U)
j. The radar targets did close on the aircraft. The distance varied from 17.5 miles to about one mile. When the distance was within one mile the targets left the scope. (U)
