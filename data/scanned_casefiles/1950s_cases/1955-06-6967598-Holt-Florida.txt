HEADQUARTERS, AIR PROVING GROUND COMMAND, Eglin AF Base, Florida
1 AUG 1955

TO: Commander, 4602d Air Intelligence Service Sqdn (ADC), Ent AFB, Colorado Springs, Colorado

1. Reference AITR No. 1-55, dated 23 June 1955, Hq AFCG, Eglin AFB, Florida.

2. Further inquiries concerning the reliability of A/2C Carlos Hernandez, observer who reported referenced sighting, revealed that subject airman is of a very unreliable nature and on numerous occasions he reported seeing other objects which never existed.

3. Therefore, it is requested that AITR No. 1-55 be removed from your files, destroyed, and disregarded completely. In the future persons reporting Unidentified Flying Objects to this Headquarters will be checked for reliability before a formal report is submitted, thus eliminating the possibility of imaginary sightings.

4. In view of the foregoing, US Air Force Technical Informa-tion Sheets, Form A, are not being completed as requested in paragraph 1, basic letter. They have been withdrawn, however, for future reference in this Command.
