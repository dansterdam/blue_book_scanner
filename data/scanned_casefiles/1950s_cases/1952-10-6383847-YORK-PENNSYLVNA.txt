(Circle One): Yes or No

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size as necessary.

First of all, clarification of question 14.3: The three terms used do not pin point the sort of action noted in the flight of the object reported, but they did give me pause to occasion further explanation. Actually the object seemed to undulate slowly while in flight, a side to side movement but on a short arc all the while maintaining level flight.

Question 19-J: The object looked about 6 inches in diameter to me at the distance. It was from 1 to 1½ miles from me. It could have been very large flying very high or it could have been the size of a Piper Cub flying at a thousand feet or less.

Question 20.1 If it was very large it could have been flying at several thousand feet, say five or six thousand.

Question 20.2 This would be difficult to ascertain, it was overhead and depending upon the atmospheric conditions (in 20.1)

Question 20.3 It was the size of a Piper Cub it was flying at approximately 90 to 100 miles per hour, provided that it was flying above a thousand feet.
If it were the size of a Constellation then it had to flying high and at a high speed to remain in my vision for the time involved.

Question 20.4 Since all of the above is conditional I can only add that I am certain of having seen the object flying under the above conditions.

In general, the object remained round overhead and as it passed from my view. It did not appear to have a gaseous halo about it, nor did it have a tail, or light-beam from it. There were no other lights about it either (red and green or other running lights) It was just a round, yellow orange orb in flight.

I had noted that no sound was as great (in question 16.1). This despite the fact that it was in a city residential area. However traffic was non existent at the time, and extraneous sounds were equally absent. An airplane seen under similar circumstances would have been seen AND heard.

To clarify the apparent discrepancy in occupations (i.e. "working at my drawing board" in question 6.1. and Production Manager of a Radio station in question 28): I am. and have been a free lance artist, and printer for more than 15 years, and still am deeply involved in both listed occupations. I had served as an Artist in military service in the Reproduction Department of the Armored Force School, Fort Knox, Kentucky with MOS 206-6.

Air Force Letter No. 200-5, 29 Apr 52

SUMMARY: (Give gist of report in first paragraph. List enclosures in order. Begin text of report on AF Form 112—Part I/2)

Mr. [redacted], York, Pa.
(35831, 76447), reported observing an unidentified flying object as approximately 1724B on 13 October.

Mr. [redacted] was in the city near his home when he saw the object. Upon glancing in the sky, he observed a single bright yellow-orange light almost directly overhead. This light moved rapidly in an easterly direction. It was first headed toward the Southeast, but during the observation it "curved around" to head in a northeasterly direction. The light was still visible when it disappeared behind a tree or nearly trees. The observation lasted approximately 15 seconds.

The observer stated that he heard no sound from the object, and that there were no distracting noises near him at the time.

No trail or exhaust was noted.

The object followed a level flight path, but appeared to undulate or waver from side to side. It was visible as it traveled from a point almost directly overhead to approximately 450 above the horizon. According to the observer's account this light had a definite edge and a small but discernible diameter. It was reported to be at least as bright as the planet Jupiter. Mr. [redacted] maintained that no running lights, or other additional features were visible. He said the object was definitely not a meteor. Weather at the time was clear with 15 miles visibility.

Mr. [redacted] is [remainder of text illegible]

This Office can offer no definite explanation of the sighting. Some elements of the description, however, do suggest the possibility of an aircraft.

Mr. [redacted] of [redacted], York, Pa.,
(J0581, 76647) reported observing an unidentified flying ob-
ject at approximately 1724B on 13 October.

Mr. [redacted] was in the city near his home when he saw the
object. Upon glancing in the sky, he observed a single bright
"yellowish-white" light almost directly overhead. The light
moved rapidly in an easterly direction. It was first headed to-
ward the Southeast, but during the observation it remained
to head in a northeastern direction. The light was still visible
when it disappeared behind the top of nearby trees. The observation lasted approximately 15 seconds.

The observer stated that he heard no sound from the object,
and that there were no distracting noises near him at the time.
No trail or exhaust was noted.

The object followed a level flight path, but appeared to undulate or wave from side to side. It was visible as it traveled from a point almost directly overhead to approximately 450
above the horizon. According to the observer, the light had
had a definite edge and a small but discernible diameter. It
was reported to be at least as bright as the planet Jupiter. Mr.
[redacted] maintained that no running lights or other additional features were visible. To said the object was definitely not a
meteor. Weather at the time was clear with 15 miles visibility.

Mr. [redacted] of Radio Station WSBA, York,
Pa. was estimated the length of observation as thoroughly
accurate and his description suggested to this Office that he had
a well-prepared process of observation.

This Office can offer no definite explanation of the sighting.
Some elements of the description, however, do suggest the possibility of an aircraft.

Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D. C.

SYNOPSIS:

On 14 October 1952, Captain ROBERT E. METCALF, O. D., 1620th Air Test Support Wing, Lawrence G. Hanson Field, Bedford, Mass., relayed a report from the Boston Coast Guard Station that the Straitmouth Life Boat Station, Rockport, Mass., at approximately 2013 hours, 14 October 1952, reported a sighting of one (1) unidentified airborne object.

That within an hour similar reports were received by the Coast Guard from Coast Guard Stations in Gloucester and Provincetown, Mass., from the Coast Guard Cutter "Yankton", from a fishing boat off Gloucester, and from a yacht off Nantucket. Five (5) Coast Guardsmen who witnessed a reported phenomena were interviewed. No activity or condition developed that accounts for sighting.

DETAILS:

1. At 2130 hours, 14 October 1952, Captain ROBERT E. METCALF, O. D., Air Test Support Wing, reported that the Coast Guard Station in Boston, Mass., had received reports of sighting of unidentified airborne objects from the Coast Guard Life Boat Station at Rockport, Mass., Gloucester, Mass. and Provincetown, Mass., from the Coast Guard Cutter "Yankton" which was en route from Portland, Maine, to Provincetown, Mass., from a fishing boat off Gloucester, Mass., and from a private yacht off Nantucket Island, Mass. According to METCALF, the first report was received at 2013 hours, 14 October 1952, and the additional messages were received by the Coast Guard within the hour. On 15 October 1952, Mr. R. O.

witnesses as follows:

a. Gloucester Life Boat Station, EN 2/C POLKY

b. Swampscott Life Boat Station, Rockport, Mass., seamen
LAWRENCE FLINT and EN 2/C KENNETH SMITH

c. Race Point Coast Guard Station, Provincetown, Mass.,
Seaman AUBREY T. GRIGGS

d. Coast Guard Cutter "Yankton", CWO HAROLD L. MASTERS

BOSTON stated that no record was made of the report from the fishing
craft off Gloucester, and that the yacht off Nantucket had not
identified only as the "Charles J. Shipley". He stated that the Coast
Guard Motor Boat Registry lists one craft named the "Charles S. Shipley,"
which is further identified only as a fishing boat with home port at
New Bedford, Mass.

2. On 15 October 1952, Sam EN 2/C was interviewed
by Special Agent JULIUS B. PORTINCA, and on 16 October 1952, EN 2/C
were interviewed by Special Agent JULIUS B. PORTINCA. Interviews technically
by Special Agent [illegible]. Interviews furnished the following information:

a. Description of object: [redacted] described the object sighted
by him as a bright image, lighted with other a short exhaust or an
indistinct tail section, giving the overall impression of a clear shape.

[redacted] allowed the object sighted by him to be disc-shaped,
observed a trail which was similar in color and intensity to the object.
POLKY believed the trail to be following the object with a distinguishable
space between. He saw no exhaust trail but extended the light did
appear to be extending slightly to the rear of the object.

[redacted] described the object sighted by him as spherical in
shape like a baseball, or a "small image of the sun" and bright orange
in color.

[redacted] compared the object sighted by him to be a football
with a short trail to the rear. He added that after the object passed,
and as he looked at it from the storm, the trail was not distinct, but
seemed to be part of the object itself. The overall impression received
by [redacted] was that of a bright yellowish light.

J. Identifying Information on Observers: U.S. Coast Guard, Boston, Mass., is 22 years of age, and has served in the Coast Guard for three (3) years as an Electronics Technician. He has considerable private flying and considers himself familiar with all types of aircraft. He stated that although he has seen falling stars, he has never observed anything similar to the object observed.

NR 2/C U.S. Coast Guard, is 21 years of age and has been in the Coast Guard for approximately three (3) years. Considers himself very familiar with both jet and conventional aircraft and stated that he has often seen shooting stars, but that he has never seen anything comparable to the object observed.

Sam 1/C stated that he has been in the Coast Guard approximately fifteen (15) months and stated that he has some knowledge of aircraft identification, that he has been jet aircraft in flight, and that he has been shooting stars. He observed the object described by him to be distinctly different from anything he has observed before.

Sun Point, Provincetown, Mass., is 21 years of age and has been in the Coast Guard for two (2) years. Stated that he has often observed aircraft in flight and meteorological phenomena, but that the object in distinctly different from anything seen before.

Captain of the "Yankton", stated that the object described by him was different from anything he has seen before. He advised that he was convinced it was not a shooting star or a comet, because while he observed it, it seemed to gain altitude. ACTIONS stated that he first believed the object to be a rocket or flare from submarines in the area, but discounted that thought because of the object's tremendous speed and intensity. He added in additional comment that at approximately 2020 hours he saw what looked like the reflection of light over a city appearing in the eastern sky parallel with the horizon and that this illumination lasted for a few seconds. He did not describe this phenomena as a distinguishable object, but only as a broad glow.

Weather conditions: Interviewees all agreed that the sky was perfectly clear at the time of the sighting, temperature moderate, visibility was excellent, and ceiling unlimited. Weather conditions at 2000 hours and 2030 hours, 14 October 1952, for the Boston area were reported by the U.S. Weather Bureau, Logan International Airport, Boston, Mass., as follows: "Clear, with west wind at 10 miles per hour, visibility 15 miles, temperature 55 degrees."

Gentlemen:

After completing the copy of the enclosed report I find another from Bronx, N.Y. which fully confirms that the object in question was a brilliant meteor or fireball.

He gives 7:38 P.M.E.S.T., at time that it appeared: 1 Moon at start, Moon at midpoint, 1 Moon at end. He gives colors as blue, white, green; duration 3 to 4 seconds and of the train as 15 seconds.

In his 14 star, west of Cepheus, passed 3° under Polaris and went 10° further. Said it exploded.

He further drew the path.

In view of these two good reports, there is absolutely no doubt that the object in question was not artificial, but was simply a brilliant meteor or fireball, if you will then technical term for a exploding fireball.

Very truly,
Director
Flower Observatory.

Dear Sir:

The Air Technical Intelligence Center is in receipt of Bulletin
No. 13 of the American Meteoric Society, which pertains to extraterrestrial activity on 14 October 1952 in the New England area. Our own report
concerning this unidentified flying object is conflicting and somewhat
confusing in its particulars. However, the following may be of
interest to you. This object in question was first sighted at 1940 hours
just west from the bridge of the Eas. Coast Guard cutter "Yorkton" with sun
located approximately 22 miles east of Yarmouth, New Hampshire. The
duration of the sighting was three seconds. It was next sighted near
Providence, Massachusetts, at 2013 EDT for approximately one minute.
It was then observed for an additional eight seconds at 20.0 lat. 50.0 long. in Westport, Massachusetts.

All the observers agreed that the object looked like a long cigar
with a brilliant white light in front and a bluish trail at the rear;
that its course was 225° and that it moved "tremendously fast".

Additionally and at approximately the same time, an unidentified
flying object was seen from a fishing boat off Gloucester, Massachusetts
from a point off Marblehead Island, from an unknown local aircraft site
craft near Westfield, Massachusetts and by eight men on the ground at
Westfield, Massachusetts. It seems probable that the object seen at
Gloucester and Marblehead was the same as that seen near Westport, Attleborough, and Foxboro. Westfield, Massachusetts, is, however, in the
unpublished area; therefore, there is a strong possibility that there were
two runners in the general area at that time.

Your report of astronomical activity leads us to believe that what
the first group of observers really saw was a brilliant fire ball or fireball reported in your bulletin No. 13, undoubtedly the same as not.


- page 19 -

Coincide precisely cut the description of the objects and its course seen so indicate the above conclusion.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center wishes to express its sincere thanks and appreciation for your interest and first correlation. This Air activity and hopes that the above data will be of some use to you.

Yours very truly,

Gentlemen: I am told by Prof. Hynek that you are interested in an object seen on Oct. 14 in New England. I have on hand a copy of which is given below on our standard form. It was undoubtedly a bright meteor, so far as this report shows.

THE AMERICAN METEOR SOCIETY
BULLETIN NO. 13

FLOWER OBSERVATORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA-REPRINT NO. 11

A very brilliant meteor or fireball is reported to have passed in your vicinity on _______ at the hour of 7:45 P.M. Will you kindly fill out the following questions, which are asked on behalf of the American Meteor Society in order that permanent records of such phenomena may be obtained. When these reports are published each contributor whose report is fairly complete will be mentioned by name and the credit given. It is only by the help of those who can give personal information that data can be secured for the computation of the orbits of meteors.

Occasionally at sight and less often by day a person has the good fortune to see a great meteor, or fireball. As the number seen in the average lifetime is very small, great pains should be taken to make as accurate "Observation" as possible.

We must have the observer's name, the place from which the object was seen (the position of the observer's station must be given as exactly as he can find it), latitude, longitude, and the hour and minute when the object appeared.

For the fireball itself, the fundamental data are the point in the sky at which it appeared, and the point at which it disappeared. If it was seen at night, and the observer knows the constellations, these points can at once be described accurately with regard to neighboring stars. If, as usual, the person seeing the fireball does not know any stars or constellations, the beginning and end points can be fixed only by their directions and their angular heights above the horizon. Everywhere one knows what is meant by direction, but few can fix it accurately. However, particularly if the observer is in a familiar place, he can fix the points with regard to trees, poles, house, etc. Then with the help of a friend who can determine angles, he can measure off the directions and altitudes quite simply. If no such friend is available, the best thing to do is to use a compass or if possible a check up the direction from some map of the surrounding territory. As for altitudes, it is 90 degrees from the horizon to the zenith; hence one must make the best estimate of what part of 90 degrees each of the two altitudes is. "The Pointers" of the Big Dipper are five degrees apart; the Belt of Orion is three degrees long. Either will help in estimating a distance in degrees.

Warning should be here that in the use of miles, yards, meters or fireballs has no possible meaning and the words are warned. As a check on the direction of the path, it is always useful to give the angle of the path—in degrees, or by a diagram—with the horizon, of course saying which way the meteor was going. The object's size should be compared with that of the full Moon or some planet or bright star. Here again the use of "inches" in describing diameters has absolutely no meaning, nor has the comparison of the meteor with balls or fruit. If possible, the duration of flight should be estimated in seconds, and if an explosion is seen, one should time carefully how many minutes or seconds elapse before it is heard. This is an excellent check on other observations.

If the object is seen in daylight, exactly the same notes should be made, except that here it is impossible to use the stars as reference points. In all cases additional notes as to color, trains left, peculiar motion, etc., are useful.

A report which has only part of the desired data may be very valuable; please send us everything noted about the fireball, whether it is much or little. Your observations may include just the one point lacking in reports from other people, and so may make possible a solution of the heights and orbit.

ANNUAL METEOR SHOWERS

For the information of the casual observer the following data concerning the principal annual meteor showers are given. For leap years the dates should be one day earlier than those listed here. All dates are those of the evening on which the maximum is due, even though the shower appears after midnight and therefore on the next calendar date. For the average year the Perseids are the richest stream, followed in order by the Geminids and Orionids. The American Meteor Society is always glad to receive accurate hourly counts of meteors made by one person on any of the nights when annual streams are active.

[Table of Meteor Showers:]
Name | Duration in days | Date of Maximum | Hourly Number of all meteors on this date
Quadrantids | 4 | Jan. 2 | 28
Lyrids | 4 | April 21 | 7
Eta Aquarids | 6 | May 4 | 7
Pena-Winecke | 2 | June 28 | 7
Delta Aquarids | 3 | July 28 | 27
Perseids | 25 | Aug. 11 | 69
Orionids | 14 | Oct. 19 | 21
Leonids | 7 | Nov. 16 | 21*
Andromedas | 2 | Nov. 20 | ?
Geminids | 14 | Dec. 12 | 21

*Brilliant Leonid showers are expected in 1932 and 1933.

Dear Sirs:

The Air Technical Intelligence Center is in receipt of Bulletin No. 13 of the American Meteorite Society, which pertains to astronomical activity on 14 October 1952 in the New England area. Our own report concerning this unidentified flying object is somewhat confusing in its particulars. However, the following items may be of interest to you:

The object in question was first sighted at 1940 hours local time this bridge of the USS Gould Guard vessel "Yankee" which was located approximately 22 miles east of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The duration of the sighting was three seconds. It was last sighted near Provincetown, Massachusetts, at 2012 EST for approximately one minute.

It was then observed for an estimated eight seconds at 2030 EST at Newport, Massachusetts.

All the observers agreed that the object looked like a long cigar with a brilliant white light in front and a thin trail at the rear; that its course was 225° and that it moved "tremendously fast".

Additionally and at approximately the same time, an unidentified flying object was seen from a chimney top off Gloucester, Massachusetts from a yacht off Marblehead, Massachusetts, by two airborne F-94 aircraft near westfields, Massachusetts and by eight men on the ground at Rockport, Gloucester, Marblehead, Provincetown, and Rockport. Seabrook, Massachusetts is a strong possibility, but there were two meteors in the general area at that time.

Your report of astronomical activity leads us to believe that what the first group of observers really saw was the brilliant meteor or fireball reported in your Bulletin No. 13. Admittedly, the times do not

Coincide precisely but the description of the object and its course been to indicate the above conclusions.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center wishes to convey its sincere thanks and appreciation for your interest and efforts regarding this claimant and hopes that the above data will be of some use to you.

Yours very truly,

(Circle One): Yes No

26.1 If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
It was obviously a material object in deliberate flight powered by some force because it was in level flight and not caught in a gravitational pull toward earth. What it was, I don't know. It was however not a reflection it was a clearly defined, brilliant as the planet Jupiter visible at the same time to the southeast of point of sighting, and round at all times, from sighting to disappearing behind trees on the horizon.
