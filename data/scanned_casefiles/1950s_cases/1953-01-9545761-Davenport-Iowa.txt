Report No. 4,572nd COS

UNCLASSIFIED

The text in the document is as follows:

The date of the sighting was 12 January 1953. The object was described as being round or oval in shape, about 25 to 30 feet in diameter, white in color, and having a light underneath it. It was first sighted by Patrolman S/Sgt. Robert C. Otter, 3363 Arlington Ave., while riding in the northwest part of Davenport, Iowa. Approximately 500 yards in length, it was traveling from South to North at an estimated speed of 30 to 40 MPH.
It was next observed by two other police officers, approximately 5 minutes later, as the object was traveling over the Mississippi River and in the direction of Davenport, Iowa, approximately 1000 yards to the Southwest. At that time the object seemed to be about 500 feet in altitude and had become somewhat smaller in size. 
When the object had reached a point over Davenport, it seemed to halt or come to a stationary position, hovering for a period of approximately 30 to 45 seconds, and then it accelerated rapidly in a straight line to the East and disappeared from view. The object was observed for approximately a total of 5 to 6 minutes.
No optical or electronic sighting equipment was used. There was no physical evidence such as fragments, photographs or the like of this object. The first report was relayed to the Filter Center at 23.40 but no interception was made.
