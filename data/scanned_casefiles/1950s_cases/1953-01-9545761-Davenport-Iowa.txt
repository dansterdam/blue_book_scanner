SUMMARY: (Give concise summary of report. Give significance in brief and enter paragraph. List informants in lower left. Begin last of report on AF Form 112-Part I(1).)

None

1. On 27 January 1953 at about 2100 CST, Iowa State Highway Patrol Headquarters called this Filter Center to say that Patrolman #173, Robert Lutzer, had seen an object, then red and white, hovering in the sky west of Davenport, Iowa. This was immediately called to the ADDC but no interception was made.

2. Upon questioning, Patrolman Lutzer described the object as a red and white ball of light which hovered west of Davenport and later proceeded west out of sight over the horizon. The ball changed color from white to orange to red and white. It seemed to glow a brighter red as it increased in speed. As it neared the horizon, it hovered and bobbed about in one area and then disappeared.

3. It was estimated to be several hundred feet in size, to travel near 100 MPH for some time, and finally reach incalculable speeds before disappearing.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 58, 4572nd GOS                                                PAGE    2   of   3   PAGES

1. The date of the sighting was 27 January 1953. The object sighted appeared
to be a round and spherical ball of light, one in number. It was estimated to be
fifteen (15) miles west of first sighting, and appeared to be easily several hun-
dred feet in size. In comparison it seemed to be much smaller. It made no ex-
haust at arms length. The object made no sound and left no exhaust or trail. It
never, at any time changed shape.

2. It was first sighted by Patrolman #178, Robert Litber, 3103 Arlington Ave,
Davenport, Iowa, and Patrolman #201, George Nicholson, 2012 W. 14th, Davenport, Iowa,
while riding in the northwest part of Davenport, Iowa, approximately 900 37' W. Long.,
140 32' N. Lat. at 2022 CST. The preceding officer questioned another officer by
telephone after the sighting. He stated that he stopped the car and got out to be
able to see the object better. Since it was west of his base of operation, he
went about three miles in order to be away from town lights and to insure that this
was not an illusion caused by a reflection of some kind. This was at approximately
900 40' W. Long., 140 39' N. Lat. at 2030 CST. Both Patrolmen got out of the car
at a dark spot and turned off all lights. At this time it changed color from white
to amber then to red to amber and then white again a number of times.

3. The Patrolmen then proceeded west along Highway US 6, in an attempt to get
nearer for a better sighting. It appeared to stay stationary while they traveled
four (4) or five (5) miles west of their original location. It was still to-
wards the west. It was estimated to have been traveling faster than the car about
90 to 100 MPH, since the Patrolmen were only 60 to 65 MPH.

4. Three quarters of a mile west of Wilton Junction, Iowa, at 910 2' W. Long.,
140 36' N. Lat., the patrolmen stopped at a dark spot and got off their car to
further observe the object. They stopped at this time because the object seemed to
be gaining speed and increasing its distance between them and it. Exceeding it to
go out of sight in a short time, they wanted to be standing still and in darkness to
observe it.

5. After they had stopped and gotten out of the car, the object appeared to
pick up tremendous speed. The patrolmen said it went faster than anything he had
ever seen before. As its speed increased, its color changed to a very bright red.
It seemed that the faster it moved, the brighter red it appeared.

6. As it neared the horizon, it appeared to stop and hover over a particular
spot, and also appeared to bob up and down like a ball at times. It seemed to be
circling a particular spot in the same bobbing motion. It changed colors, white - red
amber - red - amber - white in that sequence during this movement. It then disap-
peared in the distance, still west of the patrolman at 210 CST.

7. No optical or electronic sighting equipment was used.

8. The weather was clear with good visibility with about a 15 MPH wind.

9. There was no physical evidence such as fragments, photographs or the like
of this object.

10. The first report was relayed to the Filter Center's ADDC but no interception
was made. The first call was received at this unit at approximately 2100 CST.

12. Comments of preparing officer. The preparing officer personally questioned Patrolman Lutter at about 2200 G.S.T. He has had military service during WW II and had training in Aircraft Identification. Since he is a State Patrolman and took several precautions to be sure this sighting was not an illusion, it is believed that he is a reliable source. The information in his report did not seem to indicate any known type of present day aircraft nor any type of astronomical body.

Comments of approving officer.

The information submitted by Patrolman Lutter leads to the furtherance of the belief that "Flying Saucers" are no longer to be regarded as whims of the imagination, but rather a reality.
