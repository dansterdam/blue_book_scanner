STATEMENT [Major], USNR, VR-353, TAG-145.

During the evening of 22 June 1954 I was indoors at my residence, located [Miami Beach, Fla]. At approximately 2100 hours, [partially redacted name], a fellow resident, who was sitting outside on the patio, called me in a loud excited voice to come outside. I joined him immediately where he was standing on the beach and he pointed out a large, bright, white light in-the sky. This light was hanging motionless in the sky north of us, and I estimated its position, at the time of original sighting, as slightly seaward from the beach approximately between Sunny Isles and Golden Beach.

At first glance, I took the light to be a star, but at closer observation I could not remain convinced of such an explanation. I also ruled out the possibility of its being an aircraft light for the same reasons.

As we stood and watched the light, it gradually seemed to fade out, slightly neither within its altitude, but decreasing steadily in size and intensity. From my first sighting of the light, until it could no longer be seen, was I would estimate from 3 to 4 minutes.

Subj: Unidentified object, statement on

1. At approximately 2100 on the evening of 22 June/1954 I was sitting on the front porch of my residence at [redacted] facing the Atlantic ocean. I observed what appeared to be a "falling star" on a true bearing of approximately 030 degrees. In a matter of two seconds, approximately, this light stepped in angle of descent and intensely of 3&4 brilliance that I thought it was the "turtle back" light on an aircraft in a steep dive and apparently in the process of crashing. I ran out to the beach (approximately 100 feet) and observed this light to increase in brilliance, angle of descent, and apparent speed until at an angle of about 10 degrees above the horizontal, (just above the horizon) then slow down and hover with a brilliance far greater than any aircraft light I have ever observed. At this time it was on a true bearing of approximately 010 degrees. I called for Major James Wilkins to come and see it. By the time he arrived (about one minute) the light had faded in brilliance to about the intensity of a normal white light on an aircraft. The light gradually faded in intensity and disappeared from view.

2. The light was visible for at least seven (7) minutes.

3. Estimated of speed and altitude are impossible.

4. I have never seen anything before that could be comparable to this observation.
