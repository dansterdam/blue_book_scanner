ASTRONOMY

Winter Stars Shine

The December skies offer the astronomer much to observe. This brilliant display continues for several months, making December an ideal time to become better acquainted with the constellations.

Although rapidly drawing away 
from the earth, the planet Mars is 
still fairly prominent in the western 
sky after sunset. It is now about 67,500,000 miles distant from 
the earth, and its brilliance is waning. The star Arcturus in Bootes, the herdsman, is high in the sou-
thwest and a conspicuous object.

Sirius, the dog star, in Canis Major, the big dog, is the brightest
of all the stars and reaches its highest position in the south about 
8 o'clock. Orion, the hunter, with his three belt stars, is one of the
most prominent constellations. Aldebaran, the bright star in Taurus, the bull, is low in the eastern sky. The Pleiades, or seven sisters, are high overhead. Cassiopeia, the woman, is in the northeast, and the two bears, Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, are well placed for 
observation.

In the northwest there are still visible two stars, Vega in Lyra, the harp, and
Arcturus in Bootes. These set slowly as winter progresses.

The planet Venus, as bright as it is, really pales in comparison with Sirius, 
the dog star. This brilliant star makes an impressively dazzling appearance 
in the evening sky. At the end of December it is the highest star in the sky,
reaching its greatest brilliance for the winter.

Jupiter, the largest of the planets, is also high in the southwest, and at about 
the same altitude as Sirius, but Jupiter does not glisten with the steady 
brilliance of Sirius. Saturn is a morning star, rising shortly after 3 o'clock. 
In the early morning, just before sunrise, the brilliant planet Venus will be at 
the position closest to the sun for this season, between the 15th and the 16th 
of December. This is called inferior conjunction, and Venus will then pass 
from the evening sky to the morning sky.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR NOVEMBER 29, 1958

Displaying natural curiosity by overexploring the undiscovered with artificial aurora, physicists at Stanford University have found the latest key to some of nature's best-kept secrets.

Surprising them as it has followers of the interests that run from the barest theoretical speculations to the most exacting experiments, the basic orientation toward science and the world seems to have been altered.

Basically, the achievement represents a new phase in a program of research that hase been under way for some time as physicists try to learn more about the upper atmosphere and the enigma of the northern lights.

The research, which employs the resources of what is known as Project Firefly, a Stanford-directed high-altitude rocket program, produced artificial aurora over Sweden and Connecticut, as well as near the equator. As the article states, the implications may help understanding of the normal magnetic activity at certain times.

Research with artificial aurora may help understanding of the plasma processes and energy transfer in the upper atmosphere.

SENT TO SCIENCE STARTS IN EUROPE BEFORE SCHOOL

IT WHAT HAPPENS is a child's first question on having a conversation, whether it concerns a new experience or an unusual happening. The science interests of boys and girls, of course, are far wider. This is why the Palemon Foundation, under a grant from the National Science Foundation, embarked on a new program of science education.

This program, planned to be an experiment in determining differences that might make science more appealing to boys and girls, resulted in the development of new types of science materials and a change in the teaching approach. The intent was to discover whether individual differences lead to preferences for particular aspects of science.

According to Dr. Rae Sedler, who describes the program, the pattern of science interests shows some unexpected differences between boys and girls. However, these differences have more to do with the approach to science than with basic aptitude for science itself.

Some of the attitudes and habits found helpful were: getting girls interested through "doing" experiments that have an emotional appeal, relating science topics to human interest, and avoiding as much as possible the memorization of unrelated facts. An attempt was also made to use more visual materials.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, VICINITY INCIRLIK AIB, TURKEY, 7 DECEMBER 1957.

Walter Wentker, Airman First Class, USAF, Serial No. 37 577 401, assigned 
to the 1707th Radio Transmitter Squadron, Headquarters Tactical Air Command, 
stated in substance as follows:

On the evening of 7 December 1957, I was standing outside the main gate of the 
Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, at about 7:00 p.m., when I observed a bright red object 
in the sky to the south over the city of Incirlik. The object was traveling in a westerly 
direction at an altitude of about 5000 to 7000 feet. It was in sight for about a minute 
and a half, then disappeared. No sound was heard and no exhaust or trail was 
visible. The size of the object was about the size of a coin held at arm's length.

NO CASE (Information Only) 1 December 1958 (Saucer News) Southern California

FOUR LOS ANGELES PASSENGERS driving toward San Bernardino at about 8:30 p.m., Dec. 12, 1957, saw four objects in the sky. The objects were traveling at a high rate of speed and "zig-zagging" erratically, according to the report. The objects were estimated to be about 60 feet in diameter and were described as appearing to have a "soft yellow light" around their rims. The objects were observed for about 3 to 5 minutes and then disappeared. The car was traveling at about 55 miles along the highway before it finally disappeared. The witnesses became somewhat apprehensive and believed the objects might have been following them but they could not be certain of this. One of the passengers said one of the objects seemed to stop and hover momentarily as if observing the car. The color and behavior of the objects led the witnesses to believe they were not conventional aircraft. NOTHING CONCLUSIVE.

No Case (Information Only)

10 December 1958
Ployuda, Texas

A bright object was observed near Ployuda, Texas, on the evening of 5 Dec 1958. The object was first observed as a light moving in a circle. One of several witnesses estimated the object's altitude at 12,000 feet and its speed at about 600 mph. The object changed direction several times and was observed for about 10 seconds.
