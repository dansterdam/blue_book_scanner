Dear Sir,

Yesterday afternoon I, along with three others sighted several strange objects in the air. They were in uncontrolled flight. We watched them for about 30 minutes.

Please advise if the Air Force is interested in such sightings. If so I will be happy to furnish a detailed description of our sighting from notes I made during the time they were visible.

I can be found at the Post Office at any time.

Dear [Redacted]:

Thank you for your letter of April 27. We are very much interested in the sighting of unusual objects and would like you to make a detailed report.

This report should include a brief description of the object's shape, size, colors, numbers, formation if more than one, more-by-specific features, trail or exhaust, propulsion system, speed, sound, maneuvers, manner of disappearance and other pertinent or unusual features, time of sighting and length of time observed, location of object during sighting in relation to the observer and to the sun (if possible), distance from object and an estimate of speed and altitude.

We would also like to have the names of the other observers and a brief description of the weather at the time of sight. Kindly include in this report a paragraph of your own describing what you saw and your evaluation of same.

Any information in relation to the above may be helpful in determining what the sighting were. Thank you for your cooperation regarding this matter.

Yours truly,

East Prairie, Mo.
April 28, 1953.

James B. Webb
Major, USAF
Wing Intelligence Officer
Scott AFB, Ill.

Dear Major Webb,

I shall attempt to give you detailed information you asked for in your letter of April 20.

Time of sighting was about 3:10 P.M. until about 3:35 P.M.
The objects appeared to round. Circular surface.
Altitude 14,000 feet up.
Position from SE to NW.
Color: Silver.
4 to 7 objects.
No sound.
No evidence of propulsion system.
No trail or exhaust visible.
Size-diameter as large as the wing span of 35'.
Speed-based on speed of 836 at 600MPH. Objects in maneuvers 400 to 600 MPH.
Speed in flight far in excess of 600 MPH.
Somewhat clear, no clouds and relatively unlimited.

The first object was seen entering the trail of 35'. To make a sharp left turn was first sighted while still turning. The three joined the first and all four circled once in tight formation then formed abreast.
After forming abreast they seemed to gain speed at a tremendous rate of increase. They left and disappeared parallel to the trail 1500 ft. plane.
After disappearance of the four described three were sighted north of the position. This was 120 of my position. These maneuvered around in the general vicinity of their first appearance. One of these three was motionless for about 10 min. The others moved around but not far.

At one time two seemed to be flashing signals. This could not have been a usual sun reflection because of the two being so close together. The flashing was alternate. It was not Morse Code. The signaling is very puzzling. I know of course our Air Force use radio voice radio for Communications.

It is my opinion that these objects were in controlled flights. They could not have been in flight without some kind of control. In these objects were on a semi-flat they were on edge. I could only see one side and it was a perfect circle. No wings, tail or other breaks in the body visible. I can not definitely say I saw but I am assured they were strange, unknown objects in controlled flight.

The people who saw these objects were my wife, my mother-in-law, Mrs. Stella Shorts and a man whose name I don't know. I would not recommend a statement from Mrs. Shorts because of her very poor eye sight. Although she said at the time

[Note: The last line appears to be cut off]

she saw them is is quite possible she saw spots caused by the sun glare. By
objects. Then when I looked but I checked my sight by looking away from the
objects.

I sincerely hope any information will be of some help and if I can be
of any further assistance please write.

Yours truly,

UNCLASSIFIED

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: USA
AREA REPORTED ON: East Prairie, Missouri

DATE OF REPORT: 17 May 1953
DATE OF INFORMATION: 16 April 1953

PREPARED BY: Major James H. Webb
REFERENCES: (Control number, dir, report, etc. as applicable) APL 200-5, 29 April 1953

SUMMARY: (Under extra summary of report. Use continuation is last extra paragraph. List locations in lower left)

Unidentified flying objects were also observed by five civilians in East Prairie, Missouri, 16 April 1953. Objects were unidentified.

Objects were observed for 25 minutes between 1510 and 1535 hours (Central Standard Time) at an estimated 10,000 feet. Position of objects were 35° to 53N of observers and appeared to be 10 miles of West Point, Missouri in a trail (undecipherable). By comparison with B-26 objects were similar and approximately 230° in diameter and silver in color. No visible propulsion or exhaust gases or sound was evidence. "Speed was estimated at 100 to 600 miles per hour in an unknown trail in some 600 first flight. Weather conditions were ideal with visibility unlimited.

A total of seven objects were seen during the 25 minute period. Initially only one object was seen to be trailing, a B-26 for an unknown time. After making a sharp turn to the left it was judged by three additional observers to have changed course about 360° near ground level, out abreast and continuing on the original heading 35° (in trail of B-36). The four objects disappeared parallel to the trail at 35°.

Soon after the original four disappeared, three more were seen to be maneuvering to the SE of observers. For a ten minute period one of the objects remained stationary in the vicinity. In the general vicinity. Mr. Waters further reported observing what seemed to be alternate flashing signals plus red in Frisco Code.

Our investigation shows that the 85th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Scott Air Force Base, when files interception missions with SAC aircraft in this vicinity, 16 April 1953, however, the log of the 85th Fighter Interceptor Squadron shows no unusual activity.

Downgraded at 3 year interval.
Declassified after 12 years.

One disappeared for a few minutes at low, ten, was one of the three was pretty still (for) about some time. The other 2 still moving. It was that was moving at some rate I was thinking all maybe. I first thought it was small. Concluded it was not... the size of all objects was from zero to..."

I do not think the subject was with me. I know what I saw. This certainly was not a matter of flying saucer - I was mentally prepared, and while after the so-called flying saucer, I was not sure what I was looking - I was neither excited nor tense. I know that I looked and saw them. I was quite sure of my facts. I think the only thing I might have done was to try to get a picture. As I recall, the scene was spotlessly clear.

I sincerely hope that this shift of information will be of some help. I am not sure what the objects were but I am definitely convinced we saw them.

As I do not want any publicity of any sort I forbid the use of my information or my statement on the matter of myself or my wife except for military use.

I shall be happy to co-operate further in any way possible.
