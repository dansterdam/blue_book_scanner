          Anomalous luminous phenomena
          The fireball of 1951, March 6, 14:34

TO:   Director of Special Investigations
       Headquarters, United States Air Force
       Washington 25, D. C.

       Although this incident does not fall within the purview of
AFCSI Letter No. 85, dated 23 October 1950, nevertheless, the publicity
incident to this matter and the search conducted by Dr. LINCOLN LAPAZ,
Director Institute of Meteorites, has been such that it is believed
the facts adduced will be of interest, and in accordance therewith
distribution is being accomplished.

1. SYNOPSIS: An anomalous luminous phenomena occurred 6 March
1951 at approximately 14:34 hours. The reports of this phenomena were
gathered by Dr. LINCOLN LAPAZ, and a search was made to determine
whether or not there were resultant physical evidence of a meteorite.
The physical evidence of a meteorite, if such was a meteorite, has not
been discovered. Visual observations have been reduced to points of
intersection covering an approximate rectangular area three (3) miles
by six (6) miles and within an area contiguous to Tajique, New Mexico.
Search continued by LAPAZ.

2. DETAILS: Dr. LINCOLN LAPAZ, Director, Institute of Meteorites,
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, gathered all available
sighting data of the phenomena and has attempted to recover any physical
residuary evidence as more particularly delineated in a report of
LAPAZ:

       "The March 6 fireball is the last in the long series of incidents
occurring in northeastern New Mexico and the closely adjacent portions of
Texas and Colorado. Of this series, only three fireballs produced any
acoustic phenomena, and, therefore, were initially regarded as almost
certainly teleonetic meteorite falls. The first of this trio was the
fireball of January 30, 1949 in the Amarillo-Lubbock region, which was
the subject of intensive study by the O.S.I. and the Institute of Meteorites
and other interested agencies. In spite of the fact that the area of fall
was speedily and accurately located and that this area was not only searched
for several weeks immediately after the fall, but also has been repeatedly

Subj Anomalous luminous phenomena 21 Mar 51

"Searched since, no meteoritic fragments have been recovered to date.
The second of the trio was the detonating fireball of December 4, 1949 in
the Campo, Colorado region, from which, in spite of long continued careful
search, no meteorite have been recovered. The fireball of March 6
completes the trio and bids fair to conform to the pattern set by the two
earlier falls, in that searches initiated in the accurately delimited
area of fall within 24 hours after the appearance of the fireball have
discovered no meteorites to date.

"The detonating fireball of March 6 was of exceptional magnitude,
rivalling the record-breaking meteorite fall of 1948, February 18 in
Kansas and Nebraska, from which over a thousand fragments have been
recovered. In the intensity of the light and sound effects produced, the
fireball of March 6 was seen at a distance of 140 miles by an observer
crossing plains near-fields in bright sunlight. As regards the remarkable
ground phenomena produced on March 6, they have been so fully reported on
by the news agencies as to require no comment here. Transit measures on
carefully made observation of this fireball indicate that it remained
luminous to a very low level in the atmosphere. Hence, if it were a normal
meteorite fall, the probability would be very great that solid masses
hurled to the earth, as in the earlier cases, because of the great size and
luminosity of the fireball, it seems likely that the largest surviving masses
would be of such size as to much out easily visible craters in the earth.
Yet in this, as in the two earlier cases, no trace either of meteorites or of
the effect of meteoritic impact on the earth has been found.

"In view of the very puzzling nature of the three major incidents
discussed above (and of many other unexplained minor incidents of similar
nature), I wish to repeat the recommendation I made in the case of the
Lubbock fireball (D.S.I. series). Namely, that the O.S.I. arrange to secure
photographic coverage of the area in which fragments from the March 6 fall
should have landed. (Preferably the photo-reconnaissance missions should
secure stereo coverage of the sort obtained for us in the Four Corners region
under the direction of Colonel James C. Tison, Hq. USAF, DCS/Opns, Photo
and Reconn.)

"After a careful study has been made of the photographs of the
fall area (an elliptical region with area of 8 and 5 miles, respectively,
the major axis extending from (about) Lat. 36째 21', Long. 106째 10' to
Lat. 36째 31', Long. 106째 6', see Trinidad (S-4) Sec. Aero. Chart), it is
strongly recommended that sufficient Air Force personnel be assigned to
ground search to insure exhaustive search of all areas in which meteoritic
impact appears to have occurred.

"In making these recommendations, I am chiefly influenced by the
possibility that the fireball in question may not be meteoritic in nature.
However, in the event that my first judgment is confirmed by recovery of

"Meteorites when more exhaustive Air and ground search is made, I do not feel that the effort expended by the Air Force is conducting much research would have been wasted. Meteorites recovered soon after their fall have, at present, a military value far in excess of the scientific importance they have always had..."

1.    Reference is made to the attached Spot Intelligence Report, subject as above, dated 21 March 1951.

2.    Dr. LINCOLN LAPAZ is of the opinion (see third paragraph of Dr. LAPAZ's statement, attached report) that a photographic coverage of the area in which fragments have been landed may produce data of value to the Air Force. The 17th District OSI has not expressed an opinion concerning this matter but contact was made with Headquarters, Special Weapons Command, in an attempt to secure photographic coverage. The Director, Security and Intelligence, Special Weapons Command, after a check of his facilities, informed this office that such a mission could not be accomplished by his Command due to a shortage of equipment and personnel.

3.    Reference the fourth paragraph of LAPAZ's statement, attached report; this office has informed Dr. LAPAZ that the 17th District OSI does not concur in the recommendation that Air Force personnel be assigned to ground search in the areas in which meteorite impact appears to have occurred.

4.    The attached report is forwarded for your information and review. It is requested that this District be informed if your Headquarters deems it advisable to secure photographic coverage of the area as outlined on the attached map.

PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS

PILOTS - never hesitate to use your radio. Remember that talking by radio is almost the same as talking on your home telephone.

The following are typical examples of two-way communication with airway stations.

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRWAY STATIONS: CAA Airway Communication Stations are identified by the name of the station followed by the word "RADIO".
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO"

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number and letter suffix, if any.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE"
"STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE-Y"

Example of pilot calling an airway station:
"CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER"

After communication has been established, an abbreviated form of identification may be used, if desired, using the last three units of the certificate number.
The airway station will normally answer on the radio range or radiobeacon frequency. If reply is desired on other than the radio range or radiobeacon frequency, pilots should indicate the frequency on which the station may be expected.

Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - REPLY ON ONE ELEVEN POINT ONE MEGACYCLES - OVER"

After the airway station has answered your call, proceed with your message without further call up other than preceding the message with the aircraft identification. Your message may consist of your position report, a request for weather data or other information that may be required to assist you to your destination.

Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER CLEVELAND AT ELEVEN TWENTY - FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED VFR FROM TOLEDO - WHAT IS THE WEATHER AT TOLEDO - OVER"

If you are flying VFR, a position report is not required, however, it is to your advantage that the stations along your route of flight know your position at all times in order that assistance can be rendered should you encounter difficulty.
Flight plans may be filed while in flight, with a CAA Airway Communications Station, if your departure was from an airport not served by such a station.

The word "ROGER" is used to acknowledge receipt of a message.

The word "OUT" is used when a conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - ROGER OUT"

The words "SAY AGAIN" are used if a message was not understood and a repetition is desired.

The words "STAND BY" are used to indicate that a return call will be made as soon as practicable.
Examples: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - SAY AGAIN"
"STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - STAND BY"

ENROUTE FLIGHT SERVICE
All airway communications stations are ready to provide pilots with enroute flight information or assistance at any time. You may call any CAA RADIO for latest weather along your route of flight, upper wind velocities, airport conditions, and other flight information. If you become lost or uncertain of your position, call any CAA RADIO. Personnel at CAA airway communications stations are trained to assist pilots in establishing position by any of the following methods: (a) Visual reference to terrain features; (b) Low frequency radio range orientation; (c) VHF omni-range indications (triangulations).
