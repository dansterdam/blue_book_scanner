SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT
SUBJECT: Anomalous luminous phenomena
The fireball of 1951, March 6, 14:34
TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.
Although this incident does not fall within the purview of
AGAR Letter No. 85, dated 23 October 1950, nevertheless, the publicity
incident to this matter and the search conducted by Dr. LINCOLN LAPAZ,
Director Institute of Meteoritics, has been such that it is believed
the facts adduced will be of interest, and in accordance therewith
distribution is being accomplished.
DETAILS: An anomalous luminous phenomena occurred 6 March 1951 at approximately 14:34 hours. The reports of this phenomena were gathered by Dr. LINCOLN LAPAZ, and an analysis was made to determine
whether or not there were resultant physical evidence of a meteorite.
The physical evidence, if any, which was a meteorite, has not
been discovered. Visual observations have been reduced to the point of
interest(1) range and (2) thin and slow moving object, but not identifiable as any specific type of aerial vehicle.  Search continues by LAPAZ.
DETAILS: Dr. LINCOLN LAPAZ, Director, Institute of Meteoritics, University of New Mexico, gathered all available residuary evidence as more particularly delineated in a report of Dr. LAPAZ.
"The March 6 fireball is the last in the long series of incidents
occurring in northeastern New Mexico and the closely adjacent portions
of Texas and Colorado. Of this series, only limited fireball production
was noted, and certainly any detonating meteoric falls was regarded as almost completely absent. The first of this trio was the fireball of January 30, 1949 in the Amarillo-Clovis region, which was the subject of intensive study by the U.S.I. and the Institute of Meteoritics and others. And the next event was the fireball of February 13, 1951 in the Animas-Lordsburg region, which was followed shortly by the March 6 incident, which has been the scene of full and continuous investigation for several weeks immediately after the fall, but also has been repeatedly

The text in the document is as follows:

File 240
Sub: Anomalous luminous phenomena

Searched since, no meteoritic fragments have been recovered to date. The second of the trio was the detonating fireball of December 4, 1949 in the Dodge, Nebraska, vicinity, from which a series of long-continued careful searches, no meteorites have been recovered. This fireball of March 6, was apparently less brilliant and somewhat delayed in its effects than the two earlier fireballs. The area of fall within 24 hours after the appearance of the fireball have disclosed no meteorites to date.

The detonating fireball of March 6 was of exceptional magnitude, virtually the second-largest known exceptional magnitude, following the falls of 5/9/48 and 2/13/49 in Kansas and Nebraska, from which over a thousand meteorites have been recovered. As the fireballs and sound effects produced by this fireball indicate, the explosive character of the phenomena produced.

The fireball of March 6 was seen at a distance of 180 miles by an observer in flight. As regards the remarkable sound phenomena produced, no BAN has yet been made. In view of this, no comment here. Transit measures on the fireball strongly indicate that it remained luminous to a very low level in the atmosphere. Hence, if it were a normal meteorite fall, the probability would be very great that solid masses survived to fall to the earth. Furthermore, because of the great size and luminosity of the fireball, the inevitable existence of a fall of meteoritic material in the area seems certain. Yet in this, as in the two earlier cases, no trace either of meteorites or of the effects of meteoritic impact appears on the search found.

In view of the very puzzling nature of these major incidents disclosed by these recent triangulation and other indications of material nature, I wish to repeat the recommendation I made in the case of the Dodge fireball, namely, that the O.S.I. arrange to secure photographic coverage of the area in which presents from the March 6 fireball should be searched. (Preferably the photo-reconnaissance missions should secure stereo coverage of the sort obtained for us in the Four Corners region under the (1) direction of Colonel Freme G. Henson, USAF, 1212/CIns.) Photo-
graphs made of the region of fall should clearly show the nature and extent of the area.

AFTER A CAREFUL STUDY HAS BEEN MADE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE FALL AREA (AS ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE, WITH AXES OF 8 AND 5 MILES RESPECTIVELY), THE MAJOR CONCLUSION SEEMS JUSTIFIED. THAT 'SUFFICIENT AIR FORCE PERSONNEL BE ASSIGNED TO GROUND SEARCH TO INSURE EXHAUSTIVE EXAMINATION OF ALL AREAS IN WHICH METEORITIC IMPACT APPEARS TO HAVE OCCURRED.'

In making these recommendations, I am chiefly influenced by the possibility that the findings in this case may be comparable to those in the Dodge case, namely, that, though no meteorites were found in an extensive search, there are strong indications that substantial damage and spectacular effects may have been produced, requiring a more exhaustive search than appears to have been made in this instance.

Physical Fact of 1951, March 6, 1951.

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, United States Air Force

1. Reference is made to the attached Spot Intelligence Report, subject as above, dated 21 March 1951.

DR. LAPAZ's statement, attached (report) that a photographic coverage of the area as where the luminous phenomena was reported in his opinion could have landed was noted.

The 17th District OSI has no objection to this recommendation but contact was made with Headquarters, Special Weapons Command, in an attempt to secure photographic coverage, with negative results. DR. LAPAZ further informed this office that such a mission could not be accomplished by his Command due to a shortage of qualified personnel.

3. Reference the fourth paragraph of DR. LAPAZ's statement, attached at report, the 17th District OSI does not concur in the recommendation that Air Force personnel be assigned to ground search in the area in which meteoric ingress appears to have occurred.

1. This attached report is forwarded for your information and view. It is requested that this District be informed if your Headquarters deems it advisable to secure photographic coverage of the area as outlined on the attached map.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document titled "PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS" which provides guidance on how pilots should communicate with airway stations, including instructions on identification of aircraft, communication procedures, and a radiotelegraph code.

PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - Y".

COMMUNICATION OF AIRWAY STATIONS: CAA Airway Communications Stations are identified by the name of the station followed by the word "RADIO".
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO".

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - Y".

After communication has been established, an abbreviated form of identification may be used, if desired, using the last three digits of the certificate number only.

CALL SIGNS: To determine the radio range or radiosignal frequency, pilots should indicate the frequency on which the station is expected to reply.
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS STINSON THREE SIX FIVE - REPLY ON ONE ELEVEN".

POINT ONE MEGACYCLES OVER: After the airway station has answered your call, proceed with your message without further call up other than preceding the message with the identification call sign of your station as in preceding the weather data or other information that may be required to assist you to your destination.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - GIVE ME CEILING AND AT ELEVEN TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND FEET FIELD PLAN TO TOLEDO - OVER".

If you are flying VFR, a position report is not required, however, it is to your advantage that the stations along your route of flight know your position at all times in case that assistance can be rendered should you encounter difficulty. Flight plans may be filed with a CAA Airway Communications Station, if your departure was from an airport not served by a CAA station.

The word "ROGER" is used to acknowledge receipt of a message.
The word "OUT" is used when a conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - ROGER - OUT".

The words "SAY AGAIN" are used if a message was not understood and a repetition is desired.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - SAY AGAIN - OVER".

ENROUTE FLIGHT SERVICE: All airway communications stations are ready to provide pilots with enroute flight information and assistance at any time. You may call any CAA RADIO for latest weather along your route of flight, upper wind velocities, airport conditions, and other flight information. If you become lost or unable to determine your position, trained personnel are available at these stations to assist pilots in establishing position by any of the following methods: (a) Visual reference to terrain features, (b) VHF omni-range indications (triangulations).
