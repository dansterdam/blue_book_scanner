1. SYNOPSIS: Civilian pilot reported seeing an unconventional air-
craft in area of Brockton, Mass., on 27 August 1950.

2. DETAILS: On 22 September 1950, the Asst. Chief of Staff, G-2,
New England area, Boston Army Base, furnished 1st District Office with a
copy of a letter dated 13 September 1950, from one [redacted] (Wilbur Road, Lime Rock, RFD
Seylesville, Rhode Island) is employed as a radio mechanic at Quonset
Naval Air Station, Rhode Island. Letter from [redacted] contained a report of
unconventional aircraft sighted near Brockton, Mass. At 1830 hours,
27 August 1950, EARLY, a private-licensed pilot (since 1947), was flying at
1300 feet in the Brockton area and spotted a shiny white spherical object
which he estimated was approximately twenty (20) feet in diameter, proceeding
at a high rate of speed in an easterly direction at least one thousand (1,000)
feet beneath a broken cloud formation. The pilot could see no projection
or irregularities on the surface of the object and could not estimate the
speed of the object although he believes it was going as fast as jet planes
he has seen at low altitude at Quonset Naval Air Station. As to propulsion
of the object, [redacted] stated that the object could not have been windblown
inasmuch as it was proceeding in an easterly direction on a steady course and
the wind direction was south, yet no exhaust smoke could be seen and no unusual
noise was heard by the pilot. The pilot was accompanied by a youngster of
twelve (12) years from Berkeley, Rhode Island, who corroborated that he pointed out the
object to the boy at the time of sighting and after the object had disappeared
from sight, asked him to describe it. Description according to [redacted] tallied with his own.
