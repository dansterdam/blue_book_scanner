One round, red obj, the size of a nickel (thru binoculars), was seen to travel west at a slow rate of speed.

11. COMMENTS
/Since this obj crossed a major portion of the sky, in a straight course, in a period of seven to eight minutes, it is highly suggestive of a/c. A Northwestern flight left Minneapolis to Fargo, N D at 2050CST on 23 Jul 55, 20 mins before sighting occurred. St Cloud is on flight path from Minneapolis to Fargo and is approx 50 miles from Minneapolis. Probably aircraft.
