The text of the document is as follows:

Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia
3 February 1953

I. Description of Incident
Military personnel observed a red-yellow-white stationary object from this base at approximately 22:30 EST. The object was observed for 15 minutes before slowly disappearing below the horizon. It appeared in the west and was brighter than red observation lights on the control tower at Dobbins.

II. Discussion of Incident
No triangulation from the two observing points was made which would have been extremely helpful and should be attempted in sightings such as this. The description and manner of disappearance strongly suggests astronomical sightings as described in Project Blue Book and Mitchell AFB in October and December of 1952.

III. Conclusion
Probably astronomical (bright evening star).

FLYING SAUCERS

Extract from the "Asheville Citizen" Feb 12,1953-

JET CHASES. RED OBJECT OVER STATE MARINE PLANE NO WATCH FOR STRANGE BODY.

Cherry Point N.C. - The Marine Corps reported today that one of its jet fighters had chased an unidentified object that flashed through the sky at astonishing speed in an F-92 panther jet fighter.

The chases, the object passed over the official Marine Corps said, but the speedy jet turned out to be no match for the object, which slipped away in a matter of seconds.

The statement gave these details: Planes at the Marine Auxiliary Air Station, Cherry Point, N.C., saw the object which was described as round, white and about the size of a silver dollar. It included the report of first Lt. W.R. Caldwell, who was flying the fighter, who said the object turned sharply after he had sighted it and then disappeared from view.

He estimated the object was about ten miles away from him during the two to three minutes he chased it. At that distance, he said, the object was about a quarter of an inch wide and three inches long. It had two red lights on the left hand side, and appeared to be about four feet in diameter, he said, and it threw out a red glow behind it.

Regarding the chasing, he said that he had the throttle of his jet wide open but the plane suddenly dropped from his altitude and disappeared. Captain Thomas W. Riggs was one of several pilots who corroborated Lt. Caldwell's story when he received a call from Gerald Midget, a farmer living near Orville, N.C., reporting the sighting. Midget said the object passed over his farm in a swampy area and then a ground fire was seen. Marine helicopters searched the swampland and found a small fire but no signs of a crash.

The Marine Corps statement said the object was first sighted by a helicopter which reportedly had investigated the incident at Norfolk. Marine Ground Control Interceptor Squadron said instruments had measured the speed of the Navy fighter.

Marines Say Jet Pilot Chased Glowing Object
CHERRY POINT, N.C., Feb. 12 (AP). - The Marines at the Cherry Point Marine Air Station tonight reported that a Navy jet pilot chased a mysterious glowing object over the Atlantic Ocean for about 20 minutes.
A spokesman said the Norfolk Navy Air Station confirmed the report, but did not specify what the object was. A Navy spokesman said the pilot chased the object some 10 miles out over the ocean. The pilot said the object was about 10 feet in diameter and gave off a bright glowing light.
The spokesman said the pilot gave up the chase because the object "pulled away" from him at a speed he estimated at between 500 and 600 miles per hour. Several other Navy and Marine pilots also saw the object, which suddenly disappeared, the spokesman said.
A helicopter spotted the mysterious object again later and attempted to close in on it, but it disappeared before the helicopter could get close enough for a better look.
The spokesman said searchlight squadrons failed to make contact with the radar.

DEAR SIRS:

We, the directors of U.F.O. Research Associates, would like any information that you could give us in the "Chancy Case" - the case which was reported to have taken place in case No. 1-53, which involves the reported destruction of a Pipers Cub airplane to one Fred Mergan. The incident which was to have taken place on a day in July, 1953, when Serge's plane was said to have collided with an object of some sort, at Cherry Point, N.C. - Feb. 11, 1953.

The Marine Corps reported that no damage had been caused and was unable to find any trace of the object which had passed through the sky at better than 500 miles per hour. Any information that you could give us would help in our study of the UFO PHENOMENA.

Sincerely,
Richard L. Dickinson
