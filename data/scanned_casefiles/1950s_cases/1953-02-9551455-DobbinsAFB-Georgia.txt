Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia                                     8 February 1953

I.   Description of Incident

Military personnel observed a red-yellow-white stationary object from this base as well as Knoxville, Tennessee, at 2145 EST which was observed for 15 minutes before slowly disappearing below the horizon. It appeared in the west and was brighter than red obstruction lights on the control tower at Dobbins.

II.  Discussion of Incident

No triangulation from the two observing points was made which would have been extremely helpful and should be attempted in sighting such as this. The description and manner of disappearance strongly suggests astronomical sightings at Presque Isle AFB and Mitchel AFB in October and December of 1952.

III. Conclusion

Probably astronomical (bright evening star).

JET CHASES RED OBJECT OVER STATE, MARINE PLANE NO MATCH FOR STRANGE BODY.
Cherry Point N.C.

The Marine Corps reported today that one of it's jet planes had chased and then lost -- a red lighted object that flashed through the sky at astonishing speed . an F9F Panther Jet fighter pilot chased the object over coastal North Carolina Monday night an official Marine Corps said, but the speedy jet turned out to be no match for the object, whatever it was.

The Marine Corps statement was issued at headquarters of the Second Marine Air Wing here. It included the report of First Lt. Ed Balocco, 24, of Antioch, Calif., the pilot who chased the object.

The statement gave these details: Planes at the Marine auxiliary Air Station at Edenton, N.C. had been alerted by a Navy signal tower at Norfolk, Va., to watch for a yellow object which had been reported sighted from the ground over an area near the Virginia - N.C. border.

Balocco went to the area, but sighted nothing after cruising around for half an hour. He then took a southerly course to return to his base at Edenton. Over Washington, N.C. I saw what looked like an airplane with red lights which appeared below at about 2000 feet. Balocco said, to look back at the object was the fact that it moved from below me 10000 ft vertically in a matter of seconds. Balocco said that he turned about and chased the object at a speed of better than 500 mph but was unable to gain on it.

He estimated the object was about ten miles away from him during the three to four minutes chase. At that distance, he said, the object was about a quarter of an inch wide and three inches long. The object was the colour of white heat and it threw out a red glow behind it. It had two red lights on the left hand side, bouncing and flashing off the end, encircling an arc.

Balocco said he seemed to gain on the object for a time but the plane suddenly dropped from his altitude and disappeared towards the coast. Balocco called in other planes to help in the search. Captain Thomas W. Riggs was one of several pilots who responded. Riggs said he sighted an object flying low near the Carolina coast but couldn't identify it. The Marine Corps said it later received a call from Gerald Midget, a farmer living near Oriental, on the coast. Midget reported seeing a flash in a desolate swampy area, and then a ground fire. Marine helicopters searched the swampland and found a small forest fire but no signs of a crash.

The Marine Corps statement said the object was first sighted by a helicopter, which reported the incident to Navy tower at Norfolk. A Marine Ground Control Interceptor Squadron failed to make any contact. Meanwhile, Balocco had answered the Navy alert.

BALOCCO: THE MARINE CORPS SAID, 25 AN EXPERIENCED PILOT WITH 1500 HOURS OF AIR TIME, 500 OF THEM IN JET PLANES.

Marines Say Jet Pilot
Chased Glowing Object

By United Press

CHERRY POINT, N. C., Feb. 12 - A Marine Corps air station here reported today that a Marine jet pilot chased a mysterious glowing object through the skies Monday and more than 500 miles about.

A spokesman said the Norfolk Naval Station tower alerted Marines Lt. Ed Balocco to watch for a silver object gliding from the ground. Lt. Balocco was flying at 20,000 feet near Dartford, N. C. He flew toward Cherry Point and sighted "what looked like an airplane with red lights."

The object appeared to be below him, but "when he looked again the object was the fact that it moved from below me 1,000 feet vertically in a matter of seconds," Balocco said.

A helicopter pilot said it began catching up to the object as if it were "waiting for him," the spokesman said. Then again it speeded up.

Lt. Balocco reported that he observed toward the object and saw a "sudden flash" and it disappeared.

Several Saw Object.

The spokesman said a similar object was seen by a Navy pilot over Norfolk, a Navy artillery officer and a civilian.

Lt. Balocco reported that the object was "the color of white heat, throwing out a glow" and had "what appeared to be two red lights on the left side, flashing and bouncing off the end in a described arc."

A helicopter spotted the mysterious object Monday, the spokesman said, and interceptor squadrons failed to make contact with it today.

Dear Sirs:

We the directors of U.F.O. Research Associates, would like any information that you could give us in the two cases involving UFO's mentioned below.

Case No. 1, involves the reported destruction of a Piper Cub belonging to one Fred Reagan. The Incident which was to have taken place on a day in July, 1951 when Reagan's plane was said to have been cut open by a UFO traveling at high speed.

Case No. 2, Cherry Point, N.C. Feb. 11, 1953- The Marine Corps reported that jet planes had chased a red lighted object which had flashed through the sky at better than 500 miles per hour.

Any information you could give us would help in our of the UFO PHENOMENA.
