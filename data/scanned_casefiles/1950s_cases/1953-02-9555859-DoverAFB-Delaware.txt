2 March 1953

On the nights of February 27th and 28th, 1953, I observed an unidentified object in the sky at approximately 21.20 hours.

The object appeared to be stationary in the sky and its approximate position was north-north west. It was approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.

As I continued to watch the object, it changed colors. When first observed it was a bright red. It then changed from red to white to yellow to green. It repeated this changing of colors but in no particular pattern.

On observing it for about ten minutes it started to recede on a north-north west course and appeared to lose altitude.

I watched it for about ten minutes more, after which time it was lost to sight over the horizon.

On the night of February 28th, its' actions were the same as the previous night except in the last ten minutes of its' occurrence it swerved out of its' course by approximately 15 degrees in less than 5 seconds. It swerved onto its original course with the same speed and disappeared over the horizon.

27 Mar. 53

At approximately 2100 on 20 Feb 53 the base Photo lab called me and said that a civilian in House had reported an unidentified object NNW of the field. I went immediately to the Control tower and observed this object through field glasses. The object appeared to be due West of the field and about 30° to the horizon. It seemed to flicker in color from red, pink, white, & then green toward the top. A/B Florens G. Whitney was the tower operator on duty at the time and also observed this object. I personally observed the object from 2120 to 2135 on the same date. At the later time it appeared to fade away while I glanced to the 24-19753

saw this light I observed it for

I. Description of Incident

At 2130 EST a dull red colored light was observed low on the western horizon by several military personnel. The light was slowly moving from west to northwest alternating color from yellow, green, red, and back to white. After being observed for approximately five minutes, object disappeared below the horizon.

II. Discussion of Incident

Observers were, in the opinion of the preparing officer, reliable. At the time of sighting, weather was clear, visibility eight miles. F-94's in area on other missions noticed nothing unusual. Due to the fact that the light was seen moving from west to northwest low on the horizon and then to disappear over the horizon and that the planet Venus can be seen in that direction very plainly during this part of the year, it is quite certain that the light observed was Venus. ATIC's contract astronomer was consulted and he concluded that the object observed was definitely Venus.

III. Conclusion

Astronomical - Venus.

Dover Air Force Base, Delaware

28 February 1953

I. Description of Incident

At 2121 EST four AF personnel observed a single light of alternating colors
with red predominant. The light was due west of Dover Air Force Base and about 
20° above the horizon pursuing a very gradual course from west to northwest. 
No sound, smoke or vapor was observed. It appeared to fade away or disappear 
over the horizon. There was no air traffic in the area.

II. Discussion of Incident

As in the case of the Dover sighting of 26 Feb 53, it was the opinion of 
ATIC-5 that Venus caused this sighting. ATIC’s contract astronomer was contacted 
and definitely concluded that it was Venus.

III. Conclusion

Was Venus.

1. The following information was received from the Both Air Base Squadron,
ATID-MATS, Dover Delaware. The date of the information is 26 February 1953.

2. Approximately 2130 hours, 26 February 1953 several Air Force personnel
observed a predominately red light In the western sky. Personnel made their obser-
ations from the same relative position, within 300 yards of each other, near the Air
Officers Club. Although the objects appeared predominantly red to light, it initially
Initially appeared "white", later irregularly alternating to yellow, green, red, and back to white.

3. All viewers declared this object to be the lowest eminence above the horizon. All were generally in agreement that its size, shape and speed of movement
were Inclinable, that its course was from due west to northwest. All agreed to the
absence of sound, smoke, vapor and that the object ultimately appeared to drop over
the horizon.

4. The Officer-of-the-Day was contacted, informed of the incident, scanned the
area of the sighting with negative results. Personnel apparently were inclined to
amuse over the incident and possibly wasted valuable time. From a personal knowledge
of the observers, It is the impression that all chroniclers are reliable, not given to
exaggeration, and inherently sincere,

5. Dover Tower log reflected no air traffic in their vicinity. Intelligence
Officers, 470th Air Defense Wing, New Castle County Airport, Delaware reported several
&4tft&craft, belonging to the 96th FIS, Airborne on other missions at the time of
Dover sighting. 96th FIS Pilots reported no sightings, has no knowledge of the pur-
ported assistance and were not alerted.

6. Weather at time of report was clear sky, visibility 8 miles, sea level pressure 29.65, temperature 40, dew point 30, surface winds south west at 3
Knats, altimeter reading 966 Winds aloft at 12 thousand feet from 260° at 60 Knots,
15 thousand feet from 270° at 70 to 75 knots, 20 thousand feet from 270° at 85 knots."

sky. Its position was approx. North by north 
West When I got there, I called some of my friends 
outside to see it. They all said they saw it, 
some said it was moving slitaly from side to side, 
other said it was moving away. It changed 
colors in this order, Red, Blue and white, It’s 
predominate color was Red. At approx 2130 it 
was getting real small, seemed to be moving 
away. At 2135 it was gone, it having drop 
some distance in the horizon.

On or about 1730 hrs on 26 Feb 1953 I saw a object in the sky. I can not specify a definite shape of this object because it was far in the horizon. I can not specify how far or close this object was.

When I first seen this object it was white and gradually turned to red as it dropped in the horizon & then disappeared. My position was steps in front of the NCO Club. It took a period of 15 minutes to disappear. The sky was clear.

DOVER AIR FORCE BASE

27 Feb 1953

On the night of February 26, 1953, I, A/1C Richard C.
Taylor sighted an unknown and unidentified object in the sky.
When sighted the object was approximately 4000 feet high and
looked to be slowly loosing altitude. The object was moving
North West at a speed which I could not estimate because the
object was moving directly away from me.

When first sighted the object seemed suspended and was
omitting a bright red light. As I watched it, it changed
colors from red to white to yellow to green and continued to do
so but in no set pattern.

When I sighted the object I was at the base theater, leaving
for the Photo lab. With me were A/2C Charles Brown and A/2C
Karl Helgason who also saw the object. Walking toward the Photo
Lab, which is approximately North West of the theater, the object
seemed to lose altitude and slowly recede. Upon reaching the
the Photo Lab we lost sight of the object over the horizon.
The time of this sighting was approximately 2130 and continued for
about 20 minutes. Upon first sighting it I reported it to the O. D.
