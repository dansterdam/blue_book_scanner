2 March 1953

On the nights of February 27th and 28th, 1953, I observed an unidentified object in the sky at approximately 220 hours. The object appeared to be stationary in the sky and its approximate position was north-north west. It was approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.

As I continued to watch the object, it changed colors. When first observed it was a bright red. It then changed from red to white to yellow to green. It repeated this changing of colors but in no particular pattern.

On observing it for about ten minutes it started to recede on a north-north west course and appeared to lose altitude.

I watched it for about ten minutes more, after which time it was lost to sight over the horizon.

On the night of February 28th, its action were the same as the previous night except in the last ten minutes of its occurrence it swerved out of its course by approximately 15 degrees in less than 5 seconds. It swerved onto its original course with the same speed and disappeared over the horizon.

that a Civilian, to Hoyer had reported
an unidentified object NNW of the field.
I went immediately to the Control

Dover Air Force Base, Delaware                                26 February 1953

I. Description of Incident

At 2130 EST a dull rod colored light was observed low on the western horizon by several military personnel. The light was slowly moving from west to northwest alternating color from yellow, green, red, and back to white. After being observed for approximately five minutes, object disappeared below the horizon.

II. Discussion of Incident

Observers were, in the opinion of the preparing officer, reliable. At the time of sighting, weather was clear, visibility sight miles. F-94's in area on other missions noticed nothing unusual. Due to the fact that the light was seen moving from west to northwest low on the horizon and then to disappear over the horizon and that, the planet Venus was seen in that direction very plainly during this part of the year, it is quite certain that the light observed was Venus.
ATIC's contract astronomer was consulted and he concluded that the object observed was definitely Venus.

III. Conclusion

Astronomical - Venus.

Dover Air Force Base, Delaware                                   28 February 1953

I.    Description of Incident

At 2121 EST four AF personnel observed a single light of alternating colors with red predominant. The light was due west of Dover Air Force Base and about 20° above the horizon pursuing a very gradual course from west to northwest. No sound, smoke or vapor was observed. It appeared to fade away or disappear over the horizon. There was no air traffic in the area.

II.   Discussion of Incident

As in the case of the Dover sighting of 26 Feb 53, it was the opinion of ATIC-5 that Venus caused this sighting. ATIC's contract astronomer was contacted and definitely concluded that it was Venus.

III.  Conclusion

Was Venus.

P. K. MEAD, Major, USAF                      Statements by personnel at 30th ABS,
IR-805-2, dtd 21 Nov 52                      Dover, Del.

1. The following information was received from the 30th Air Base Squadron,
(ATD-ACTS), Dover, Delaware. The date of the information is 25 February 1953.

2. Approximately 2130 hours, 25 February 1953 several air force personnel
observed a predominantly red light in the western sky. Personnel made their observations from the same relative area, within 300 yards of each other, and the majority
stated that a although the object appeared predominantly red to yellow, green, red, and
back to white.

3. All viewers declared this object to be the lowest assistance above the
horizon, all were generally in agreement that its size, shape and speed of movement
were indefinable, that its course was from due West to Northwest. All agreed to the
absence of sound, smoke, vapor and that the object ultimately appeared to drop over
the horizon.

4. "The Officer-of-the-Day was contacted, informed of the incident, scanned the
area of the sighting with negative results. Personnel apparently were inclined to
muse over the incident and possibly wasted valuable time. From a personal knowledge
of the observers, it is the impression that all civilians are reliable, not given to
exaggeration, and inherently sincere.

5. Dover Tower Log reflected no air traffic in their vicinity. Intelligence
Officer, 117th AIS Base, New Castle County Airport, Delaware, reported several
sightings. Reportedly, belonging to the 96th AIS, at Dover, other missions in the area of
Dover sighting. 96th FIS Pilots reported no sightings, has no knowledge of the purported circumstances.

6. Existing weather at time of report was clear sky, visibility 8 miles, sea
level pressure 29.66, temperature 46°, dew point 30, surface winds South West at 3
knots, altimeter reading 30.12. Winds aloft at 12 thousand feet from 260° at 50 knots,
14 thousand feet from 270° at 70 to 75 knots, 20 thousand feet from 270° at 85 knots.

DOVER AIR FORCE BASE

27 Feb 1953

On the night of February 26, 1953, I, A/1C Richard C. Taylor sighted an unknown and unidentifiable object in the sky.

When sighted the object was approximately 4000 feet high and looked to be slowly losing altitude. The object was moving North West at a speed which I could not estimate because the object was moving directly away from me.

When first sighted the object seemed suspended and was emitting a bright red light. As I watched it, it changed colors from red to white to yellow to green and continued to do so but in no set pattern.

When I sighted the object I was at the base theater, leaving for the Photo lab. With me were A/2C Charles Brown and A/2C Karl Helgason who also saw the object. Walking toward the Photo Lab, which is approximately North West of the theater, the object seemed to lose altitude and slowly recede. Upon reaching the Photo Lab we lost sight of the object over the horizon.

The time of this sighting was approximately 2130 and continued for about 20 minutes. Upon first sighting it I reported it to the O. D.

2. "Approximately 2121 through 2135 hours, 28 February 1953, Four Air Force Personnel witnessed a single object of alternating colors the west of Dover AF Base. All witnesses made their observations from the base AW within an eight or nine mile radius of one another.

3. "All observers reported a continual series of alternating colors of no set pattern, with red seemingly predominant, and an object position of approximately 200 above the horizon pursuing a very gradual course from west to northwest, no sound, smoke or vapor was reported. Object ultimately appeared to fade away or disappear over the horizon.

4. "Officer observer requested scramble from Controller of 777th ACW Squadron at Falcona, New Jersey, but permission was denied by the 26th Air Division since the object had already begun to fade. Officer observer reported no trace of former sight at 2115 hours. Negative traffic in general area.
