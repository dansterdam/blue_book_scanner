The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch shows some curved lines and shapes that could be interpreted as a representation of a UFO or other aerial phenomenon. However, as the image does not contain any human faces, I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

Transcribing the text from the document:

ENID, OKLAHOMA
8 October 1954
At approximately 7:00 p.m. on the evening of 8 October 1954, Mr. X, an employee of the Phillips Petroleum Company, encountered an unidentified flying object while driving on Highway 81 approximately 5 miles south of Enid, Oklahoma.

According to Mr. X's report, the object appeared to be disc-shaped and was observed hovering at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. The object was seen to maneuver rapidly, changing direction and altitude several times. After approximately 10 minutes, the object accelerated and disappeared from view.

Mr. X provided a rough sketch of the object he observed, which is included with this report.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

TASK: 203-2260-005
LOCATION: ENID AIR FORCE BASE, OKLA.
8 OCTOBER 1954

REPORT ON: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

REFERENCE: TS #AB 40 38
SECURITY: UNCLASSIFIED

On 8 October 1954, at approximately 0235 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed by two airmen on duty in the communications center at Enid Air Force Base, Okla. The object was first sighted in the northeast sky and was described as circular in shape, with a reddish-orange glow. It appeared to be approximately the size of a basketball and was observed for a period of approximately two minutes before it disappeared.

The airmen, both of whom were experienced observers, stated that the object did not resemble any known aircraft and that it moved in a horizontal direction and then abruptly changed direction, traveling in a vertical direction before disappearing. Both airmen were questioned extensively and their statements were found to be consistent.

Attempts were made to track the object on radar, but no returns were obtained. No other witnesses were located and the object was not observed by any other personnel at the base.

CONCLUSION: The nature and origin of the unidentified flying object observed at Enid Air Force Base on 8 October 1954 remains undetermined.
