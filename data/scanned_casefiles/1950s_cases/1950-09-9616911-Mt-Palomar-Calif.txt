SUMMARY: (Under each summary of report. Give disposition in final out-coming paragraph. List inclosures in lower left)

At 2036 hours (EST), 28 September 1950, Captain Agnew and 2d Lieut. Bombardment Squadron, 2d Bombardment Wing (N), March Air Force Base, California, were standing outside the Mt. Palomar Observatory, Los Angeles, California at an elevation of 6000 feet observing the comments of the celestial bodies when they saw an apparent shooting star above the handle of the Big Dipper, fifteen degrees above the horizon.

The object, observed at a great distance, moved at a great rate of speed from approximately 340° to 100° horizontally, in two to three minutes, emitting a loud, swirling, whooshing noise similar to a rocket exhaust. The only part of the object visible was a bluish-white light which flickered intensely, the light appearing to be the size of a star.
