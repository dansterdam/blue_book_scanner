SUBJECT: 113th CIC Detachment, FAO # 8, P. O. Box 379, Knoxville, Tennessee
OBJECT SIGHTED: OVER OAK RIDGE, TENN.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:
The night of 12 and 13 October 1950, after 2325 hours on 12 October 1950, the Security Patrol at the Atomic Energy Commission Plant, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, reported seeing a bright light maneuvering at approximately 190 degrees, 1500 - 3000 feet altitude, at 100 to 125 miles per hour. The radar sightlights simultaneously called the Security Command to inform them that there was no report of any aircraft flying in the vicinity of Y-12. AEC 2330 wing, stationed at Knoxville, Tennessee, was notified. All weather flights were grounded as no known aircraft were airborne in the area. The "scrambled" fighter was airborne at 2339 and shortly thereafter the first radar target was detected. The fighter pilot advised that no object was visible to the control tower as the object recorded on all three occasions neither the pilot nor the observer saw any object visually and no object was sighted in the pilot mirrors or radar screen. At 0010 hours on 13 October 1950 the fighter had to return to its base due to fuel shortage, approximately 5 shown on the control radar screen.
The Central Officer at the Knoxville Radar Station stated that the radar targets were approximately the size of a small aircraft and that the "pips" would increase and decrease in intensity making the target assemble, alternatively, into a V-shaped and a circular pattern and did not show the normal characteristics of an aircraft due to high and low intensity, at approximately the same altitude, and flying in the similar magnetic course. Summary of other air Defense Command, Control Center, Selfridge Field, Detroit, Michigan, was notified. Capt. Summerell advised that there were no practice missions scheduled in this area. At 0210 hours, the Eastern Air Defense Command headquarters, Stewart Air Force Base, Newburgh, N.Y., was advised of the existing conditions and that investigators would be sent after daylight.
At approximately 1400 hours, 13 October 1950, investigators from the Eastern Air Defense Command Office of Special Investigations, Security Division, Armed Forces at the Oak Ridge Security, had been advised, some of which were technical advisers in radar sightings. Several theories were rejected due to improbability.
It was note concluded that unidentified aircraft were responsible for these radar sightings because before the second group appeared on the screen, the Security Patrol of the Oak Ridge Tennessee, had been advised and no unidentified aircraft were visible.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

PROBLEM
1. To inform the Air Staff of action being taken to investigate operational difficulties encountered in the operation of the early warning radar of the Continental Air Command at Knoxville, Tennessee.  

FACTS AND DISCUSSION
2. On 1 Dec 50, the Aircraft Section, AFOIV-V/TO, conferred with three officers from the Atomic Energy Plant, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These officers were: Lt B. H. O. Dickinson, II, AFIT, Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Maj J. C. Earley, AFIT, Oak Ridge Representative, Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Maj E. E. Robertson, AEC, Engineering Field Office, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. They were accompanied by Lt J. F. H. Lee, AFOIV.
3. A letter from Hq Third Army, subject: "Unconventional Aircraft," was discussed with them. These officers provided additional information on events occurring since 13 Oct 50. It appears that some form of unidentified radar phenomena has occurred at Oak Ridge which gives false targets on the screen. The discussion indicated that the false returns were due to weather. It was stated in the last Red Indian progress report that the difficulties are due either to:
a. Chemical impurities in the air  
b. Radioactive particles
c. Some form of radar phenomena.
4. The above-mentioned officers from Oak Ridge did not consider it necessary to inform the Department of the Army of the radar difficulties now being encountered until they could follow suggestions given to them during the discussion.
5. On Saturday, 2 Dec 50, approximately 1500 hours, Lt Col Willis was contacted by the USAF D/I Duty Officer concerning this problem. Maj J. P. Robertson and Brig Gen Bradner's office had been referred to the Duty Officer by General Bradley's office for a further discussion of the reports. Lt Col Willis called Maj J. P. Robertson again to determine what additional information could be furnished. Maj Robertson had no additional information. In view of the urgency of the problem, the Duty Officer at this time directed that a most practical thing to do at the moment, if it were of a serious nature, would be to request the Army to furnish a mobile radar unit capable of conducting an immediate investigation.

The following accounts of activity at the Radar Operations Section, of Detachment 2, 505th AC&W Squadron, Knoxville, Tennessee, is extracted from their official report dated 13 October 1950.

Other pertinent information was submitted in a previous Summary of Information, Subject: Objects Sighted Over Oak Ridge, Tennessee, dated 13 October 1950.

"At 0015 EST on 12 October 1950, a first target, M-17 at 25-30 miles, appeared at 270 degree radial. Then at 0023, a second target, M-17 at 35-40 miles, appeared at 315 degree. These targets appeared and faded in rapid succession (within 2-3 minutes)."

"Called ATC; they had no report of an Aircraft at this time - 0023."

"Notified Atlanta; they had no flight plans on anything coming from that direction."

"Arrow (Fighter Aircraft) airborne at 2330 E.S.T. and vectored on 250 degrees; Angels (Altitude) 2500. There were three perfect intercepts on the scope on N-35, but no joy (Fighter Aircraft made no contact)."

"Very shortly after pancake, various targets again appeared through the area. They gave good paints (Targets) on the Radar Scope but faded completely at times and then would reappear."

"TAPE still had no report for us, but had alerted all guards and were beginning to get suspicious out in case they were needed."

"We did not report these additional plots to Nobody (Call sign for Air Defense Command Control Center, Selfridge Field, M.I.). Until October (Call Sign Orlando) called in Summers at this time and explained that the same Radar Race (activity on the Radar Scope) had been noted but considered of no importance at the time."

"Targets were appearing with some regularity and proceeding South."

"They all traveled at a speed of between 100 and 155 miles per hour, held good heading and disappearing at various intervals, North of Clinton and faded right at the area line. Reappearance of this target at last coast on the same course 182 degrees was 5 (eight) miles inside area." This target faded after three sweeps (Revolutions two minutes).

"The tracks varied at time from one applicable to very light." (C (aircraft) up to 1/c of the C-47 variety (Meaning the reflected intensity of Radar waves made the target appear at first like a small aircraft and then like a large one)).

"We operated both on High Beam and Low Beam and picked up the same tracks."

"All traveled at the same approximate speed and general course. During the night this course, spread from 170 degrees to 230 degrees (magnetic compass heading)."

"At 0210 E.S.T., called Captain Summers at Nobody, he called EADF, Captain Hutchinson, and received permission to release fighters to normal status."

Description of object seen by Atomic Energy Commission Security Patrol Trooper at about 1230 hours on 12 October 1950, at (13) thousand feet, as reported by persons at Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies, Oak Ridge, Tenn:
The object was sighted at about 1230 hours on 12 October 1950, at (15) thousand feet, by an Atomic Energy Commission Security Patrol Trooper who was in a vehicle on the road between Knoxville and Oak Ridge, Tenn. When first seen, the object was estimated to be approximately one-fourth (1/4) of a mile long. The object then appeared to contract, and the "trail" followed the object. "It" then appeared to take the shape of a large ball, and then appeared to break into several smaller parts which scattered and seemed to fall. The object was a metallic color and reflected the sun. The entire incident lasted about two to three minutes. The object was reported via telephone that this object was a "falling object" as the object descended to land and then took off again. Attempts to approach the object, but when he got within fifty (50) feet of it, the object moved toward the Southeast at a high rate of speed, like a jet aircraft, and the witness was unable to keep the object in view. The Gatlinburg Air Force post was notified, and they stated they had no reports of jet flights in that area. No other reports have been received. UNCLASSIFIED

and - were any witnesses? Captain of the - 48 Security Patrol, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. At no time were any noises heard. The Chief of the Oak Ridge Security Division, stated that all these persons were security guards and members of the same when questioned separately, except that Itmer had been the closest and was the only person to actually see the object. The others were near him at the same time except that he did not mention them personally seeing the object. Captain - stated that he was wearing his glasses at the time and his vision, with glasses, is 20/20 in the right eye, and 20/30 in the left eye.
Record indicates that he is one of the "better" and most respected members of the AOC Security Patrol. Nothing in his record indicates any weaknesses or peculiar inclinations.
It is stated that he would not have reported this incident if there had not been a witness. An investigation was sufficient to give information because of the fantastic nature of the incident.
Captain - stated that the object was only visible for a moment on its third appearance and stated that the object appeared to be round as it crossed the sky at a high rate of speed.
NOTES: The above information was obtained on 16 October 1950 from interviews with - (Supervisor Security Section), University of Tennessee, Chief of Atomic Energy Commission Security Division, Atomic Energy Commission, and Captain - of the Oak Ridge Security Patrol.
In addition, the Atomic Energy Commission Security Division took Geiger counters to the scene of the incident but could find no reading.

UNCLASSIFIED
18 October 1950

The following accounts of activity at the Radar Operations Section of the Detachment 4, 502d AC&W Squadron, Knoxville, Tenn. on the night of 12 - 13 October 1950:

[Summary of Information, Subject: Objects Sighted Over Oak Ridge, Tennessee, dated 18 October 1950]

"Prior to this report, (report by AEC patrolman) we had a recurrence of targets like Thursday night (midnight 12 - 13 October 1950) - we had some scramble each time of aircraft and made several good passes, but heading of 160 degrees (Magnetic North). Apparently only two or three aircraft were involved and other aircraft are not supposed to fly). Our fighter worked from 2500 to 5000 feet for approximately 30 to 40 minutes per pass. Every characteristic was the same as before except that the speed was slower.

There was nothing on the scope (Radar Scope) at the location of this strange object (the location was called in by 'tel observers' at Oak Ridge).

The strange visitor was reported to Captain Cole at Moody (Call sign for Air Defense Command Control Center, Goddfige Field, Ala.) who carried through to Hq (Headquarters) 4708 (Air Defense Command). This action were (was) to put a patrol over the area, which was done.

The observers state: "we chartered a patrol and later Captain Cole called." There was nothing in the sky except a large flock of birds, which were painting, (giving image on the Radar Scope). This was estimated to be between 200 and 300. This was at 7000 feet. His patrol up until 1730 E.S.T., when I left duty, ranged from a low level pair to 7000 feet.

He was vectored after several well painted targets, but saw nothing.

PAID sent a list of questions to be answered by the observers. These answered questions concerned aspect, speed, time, sky, and terrain conditions, altitude, when smoke disappeared, etc.

This report was signed by _______________, Controller at the Radar Site, at the time of these occurrences.

REMARKS:
At approximately 1:30 P.M., on October 16, 1950, while working at Blair Gate, I saw an object in the sky over R-25 traveling in a straight line and going very fast. The object was white and seemed to be the size of a baseball at the distance it was from me. It seemed to be very high.

At exactly 2:55 P.M. on October 16, 1950, the object disappeared from the northeast at a considerably lower altitude and traveling a lot slower than before. I stopped a car which was coming in the gate in order to witness the object. As I watched the object, I pointed it out to the driver and Hank, who were coming in to work. I watched the object for several minutes. This object was slowly circling in a wide circle and spinning very fast, the color changed slightly around the edges. The object drifted towards the northwest and then suddenly shot straight up into the northeast and going very fast. We watched the object disappear into the northeast.

This information was phoned in to Headquarters immediately by the undersigned. About fifteen minutes after the object disappeared into the northeast, an F-82 Fighter plane showed up in the area where the object was last seen but a appeared to be thousands of feet higher than the object reported.
