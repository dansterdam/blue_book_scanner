SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

The night of 12 and 13 October 1950, after 2325 hours on 12 October 1950, objects were sighted in the radar scope of the Knoxville, McGhee Tyson, Airport, radar scopes. The first objects were sighted at 2325 hours E.S.T., traveling at approximately 190 degrees, 1500 - 3000 foot altitude, at 100 to 125 miles per hour. The radar data indicated called atomic Energy Commission to inform them that there was no report of any aircraft flying in the vicinity. At 2330 hours a fighter of the 5th All Weather Fighter Sqd., 52nd. All Weather Fighter Wing, stationed at McGhee-Tyson Airport, Knoxville, Tennessee, "scrambled" to intercept these unidentified objects. At the same time Knoxville Civil Aeronautical authorities were contacted and they advised that no aircraft were known to be flying in the vicinity. The "scrambled" fighter was airborn at 2339 and shortly thereafter, according to the radar scope, was seen to intercept the hostile objects. The fighter pilot advised that no object was visible so the control vectored him so as to intercept this object two more times. On all three occasions neither the pilot nor the observer saw any object visually and no object was sighted on the fighter aircraft's radar scope. At 0010 hours on 13 October 1950 the fighter made a "complete sweep of the control area" in an attempt to locate any of the targets (approximately 5) shown on the control radar screen.

[Continued in next paragraph, partially illegible]

The radar targets were approximately the size of a small aircraft and that the "pilots" would increase and come in intensity making the target resemble, alternately, a L-5 and a C-47. [Remainder of paragraph partially illegible]

[Rest of document continues with details about notifications to various authorities and an investigation at 1100 hours on 13 October 1950]

SUBJECT: OBJECTS SIGHTED OVER OAK RIDGE, TENN.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

were on the alert for any unusual occurrences. Atomic Energy Commission officials
advise that the Security Patrol heard only the one aircraft identified as the air
Force fighters, Pucker, the lead of a lineup, close of being, along objects from
AEC, and light aircraft from Sulphur Springs Airport, were rejected with good
reason.

An officer at the Knoxville radar site and an officer from the Eastern Air
Defense Command stated that they have seen such a pattern on radar scopes in the
past. For which there was no further explanation. Many hazarded the opinion
that this pattern could have been caused by atmospheric or technical interferences,
however, the exact cause has not been determined.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

PROBLEM
1. To inform the Air Staff of action being taken to investigate operational difficulties encountered in the operation of the early warning radar of the Continental Air Command at Knoxville, Tennessee.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION
2. On 1 Dec 50, the Aircraft Section, AFOIN-V/TO, conferred with three officers connected with the Atomic Energy Plant, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These officers were: Lt. B. W. O. Dieckman, Lt, AFTN, Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Maj. J. L. Steele, AF Plant Representative, Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Maj. B. E. Robertson, AC, Engineering Field Office, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. They were accompanied by Maj. F. W. Haas, AFOIN.

3. A letter from Hq Third Army, subjects "Unconventional Aircraft," was discussed with these officers. Additional information on events occurring since 13 Oct 50. It appears that some form of unexplained radar phenomena has occurred at Oak Ridge which gives false targets on the screen. The discussion indicated that the false returns were not due to weather, as was stated in the 1st Ind prepared by Intelligence Department, AMC. It appears that the radar difficulties are due either to:

a. Chemical impurities in the air
b. Radioactive particles
c. Some form of radar phenomena.

4. The above-mentioned officers from Oak Ridge did not consider it necessary to inform the Department of the Army of the radar difficulties now being encountered until they could follow suggestions given to them during the discussion.

5. On Saturday, 2 Dec 50, approximately 1500 hours, Lt Col Willis was contacted by the USAF D/T Duty Officer concerning this problem. Maj. B. P. Robertson and Senator-elect Monroney had been referred to the Duty Controller by General Brealey's office for a further discussion of the reports. Lt Col Willis talked to Maj. B. P. Robertson again to determine what additional information could be furnished. Maj Robertson had no additional information. In view of the lack of technical information, Lt Col Willis recommended to the Director Duty Officer that the most practical thing to do at the moment, if it were of a serious nature, would be to request the Army to furnish a mobile radar unit capable of

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

FAO 789, P.O. Box 379, Knoxville, Tennessee

OBJECTS SIGHTED OVER OAK RIDGE, TENNESSEE

21 October 1950

Attached to this Summary is eleven (11) inclosures which tend to clarify information contained in the former two (2) summaries of Information on JUJU CT.

These inclosures are composed of witnesses statements, background information concerning previous sightings of peculiar objects over Oak Ridge, and radar reports. The most reliable sources available were utilized in the compilation of this report. The employment records and the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports concerning the witnesses were inspected to ascertain their reliability, integrity, and loyalty to the United States Government.

The opinions of the officials of the Security Branch, NEP, Division, Oak Ridge, AEC, Oak Ridge Security Patrol, AEC, Knoxville, Air Force Radar and Fighter Squadrons, Knoxville and the OSI, Knoxville, Tennessee, fail to evolve an adequate explanation for SUBJECT, however the possibilities of practical jokers, mass hysteria, ballons of any description, flights of birds (with or without comets or other objects attached), falling leaves, insect swarms, popular weather conditions, reflections, flying kites, objects thrown from the ground, windblown objects, insanity, and many other natural happenings have been rejected because of the simultaneous witnessing of the objects with the reported radar sightings because of the reliability of the witnesses and the detailed, similar description of the objects seen by different persons and because of impossibility.

The trend of opinions seem to follow three patterns of thought. The first is that the objects are a physical phenomenon which have a scientific explanation, the second is that the objects are experimental objects (from an undetermined source), guided by electronics, and the third is almost a concept that an intended demoralization or harrassment is involved. The fantastic is generally rejected.

These objects have apparently followed only two patterns. The first is that they were sighted at the same hour on two consecutive days and the second is that the line of flight is either to or from the Northeast and Southeast, which directions parallel the terrain ridges in this locality.

Attention is invited to the 1947 photograph of a flying object (inclosure # 8). Atomic Energy Commission officials advise that the Air Force Laboratory at Wright Field, Ohio, indicate that the object is a water spot on the photograph. Because this object does not resemble other water spots of the photograph, and because the object in the second photograph is following the dim trail left by the first object, some officials at Atomic Energy Commission question the veracity of

19 October 1950

The following accounts of activity at the Radar Operations Sec'tion, of Detachment # 2, 662nd AC & W Squadron, McGhee-Tyson Airport, Knoxville, Tennessee, is extracted from their official report dated 13 October 1950.

Other pertinent information was submitted in a previous Summary of Information, Subject, Objects Sighted Over Oak Ridge, Tennessee, dated 13 October 1950.

"The first target, H-47 at 2325 E.S.T., 12 October 1950, appeared as per diagram (Enclosure #2). Then in rapid succession, we had H-48, H-49, and H-51 appear.

"Called AEC; they had no report of an Aircraft at this time - 2325.

"Called Atlanta; they had no flight plans on anything coming from the North.

"Arrow (Fighter Aircraft) airborne at 2339 E.S.T. and vectored on 290 degrees, Angles (altitude) 2500. There were three perfect intercepts on the scope on H-48, but no joy (Fighter aircraft made no contact). Height Finder gave approximate angles of target at 3000. These angles varied from 1500 to 5000 feet on various targets throughout the evening. One intercept of H-48 was 11 miles at 270 degrees and from a stern approach; no joy.

"Pulled fighter off this target and sent him back into area at angles 5000. He made complete sweep of area and saw nothing.

"Notified Radar Maintenance, who checked the operation of the Radar and switched channels.

"By this time all targets had faded and area was clear. We steered Arrow back to base and he pancaked (landed) at 0014, E.S.T., 13 October 1950.

"Very shortly after pancakes, various targets again appeared through the areas. They gave good paints (images) on the Radar Scope but faded completely at times and then would reappear.

"AEC still had no report for us, but had alerted all guards and were beginning to get searchlights out in case they were needed.

"We did not report these additional plots to Nobody (Call sign for Air Defense Command Control Center, Selfridge Field, Ala.) until 0100. Called Captain Summers at this time and explained that the same Ret Race (activity on the radar scope) had started again. He knew of no practice mission by higher headquarters but said he was..."

Command, Stewart Air Field, Newburgh, New York). He called back and said their only instruction was to keep fighters on Alert Status. Told him we could have both off the ground in 1 (one) minutes.

"Targets were appearing with some regularity and proceeding South.

"They all traveled at a speed of between 100 and 125 miles per hour. Fading and reappearing at various intervals. All but one originated in the area. One did appear at 10 miles North of Clinton and faded right at the area line. Reappearance of this target or at least one on the same course 150 degrees was 8 (eight) mile inside area. This target faded after three sweeps (revolutions of the indicator on the Radar Scope which makes four revolutions per minute).

"The tracks varied at time from one applicable to very light A/C (aircraft) up to 1/6 of the G-47 variety (Meaning the reflected intensity of Radar waves made the target appear at first like a small aircraft and then like a large one).

"We operated both on High and Low Beam and picked up the same tracks.

"All traveled at the same approximate speed and general course. During the night this course spread from 170 degrees to 290 degrees (magnetic compass heading).

"At 0210 E.S.T., called Captain Summers at Nobody; he called EADF, Captain Hutchinson, and received permission to release fighters to normal status."

Observation of object seen by Atomic Energy Commission Security Patrol Trooper
1920 hours on 13 October 1950, is substantially as follows: When first seen at
an estimated altitude of twelve (12) to fifteen (15) thousand feet, the object
appeared to be an intense starlike to "skyrocket". The "foremost" left behind is
estimated to be approximately one-fourth (1/4) of a mile long. The object then
started a controlled descent, almost vertical, at a slower speed than an aircraft
would dive, and the "trail" followed the object. "B" then appeared to take the
shape of a long bullet with a streamers, or ribbon, an thick as the bullet, trail-
ing in the path of the object but connected to it. The object then levelled off
parallel to the horizon, decreased its speed, and passed within seventy (70) yards
of Ryman and another observer was stopped. The observer
reported via telephone that this object was a "falling object". As the object
decreased its speed to less than a man's normal walk, it attempted to approach
the object, but when he got within fifty (50) feet of it, the object moved toward
the Southeast at about six feet altitude above the terrain; made almost a
mechanical maneuver to go over a nine (9) foot cyclone chain link fence, then
another similar maneuver to pass over a willow tree and a telephone line, and
finally gained altitude and speed and went over a hill about one mile distance.

When it was within fifty (50) feet of the object it appeared to be a two
(2) by five (5) card (similar to the one issued to vehicles entering the "Control
Zone" at Oak Ridge) with a twenty (20) foot ribbon tail, the first two feet of which
were easily visible and the last eighteen (18) feet of which was almost transparent
and divided into several sections. The section of the tail would pulsate a dim
"glow" alternately. Through the entire length of the tail, was a black line which
might be described as a "wire". The entire color was bluish-gray similar to the
color of the top of a "wood soaking range". The "body" of the object was gently
moving up and down, and the tail waved in the breeze like a ribbon or a worm and
followed the path of the "body" of the object. There was no breeze at the time
(Knoxville Airport reports a high breeze of eight (8) miles per hour). Further,
from fifty (50) feet away, the object looked no bigger than it did from two
hundred and ten (210) feet away, and when it disappeared over the hill, one (1)
mile away, it still looked the same size that it had appeared at only fifty (50)
feet, but the "body" was then "blacked" or "pea-shaped".

When questioned further, he stated that the object had to change size
from the time they first observed it until it came near the ground, and it had
to get larger as it went over the hill or they would not have been able to see it at
such distances.

The object appeared two more times within the next ten (10) minutes and
was able to get two other observers to verify that they could see the same
"thing".

rate of speed.

NOTES: The above information was obtained on 16 October 1950 from interviews
with Trooper ---- Molecular Section, University

The following accounts of activity at the Radar Operations Section of Detachment # 2, 662nd AC & W Squadron, McGhee-Tyson Airport, Maryville, Tennessee, as extracted from their official reports, dated 15 October 1950. (Roster Summary of Information, Subject: Objects Sighted Over Oak Ridge, Tennessee, dated 13 October 1950):

"Prior to this report, (report by AEC patrolman) we had a recurrence of targets like Thursday night (midnight 12 - 13 October 1950). We had sent one scramble (flight of aircraft) out and made several good passes at one target which painted (imaged on Radar Scope) very well. It was on a heading of 120 degrees (Magnetic compass heading) and approximately 4 (four) miles inside the Eastern boundary of the area (restricted flying space) where others sighted are not supposed to fly). Our fighters worked from 2500 to 5000 feet but saw nothing. The speed of these targets varied from 40 to 100 miles per hour. Every characteristic was the same as before except that the speed was slower.

There was nothing on the scope (Radar Scope) at the location of this strange object (the location was called in by telephone from ground observers at Oak Ridge).

The strange visitor was reported to Captain Cole at Nobody (Call sign for Air Defense Command Control Center, Selfridge Field, Ala.) who carried through to NEAF (Eastern Air Defense Command). Their orders were to put a patrol over the area, which was done.

Lt. Gutherie, operating under my control and later Captain Duffy's, saw nothing in the area except one large flock of birds, which were painting (giving images on the Radar Scope). He estimated their number between 200 and 300. This was at 7000 feet. His patrol up until 1730 E.S.T., when I left duty, ranged from a low level pass over the gate to 7000 feet.

He was vectored after several well painted targets, but saw nothing.

RADF sent a list of questions to be answered by the observers. These answers were forwarded. They concerned speed, time, sky, and terrain conditions, altitude, when smoke disappeared, etc.

This report was signed by [redacted] Controller at the Radar Site, at the time of these occurrences.

REMARKS:

At approximately 1:30 P.M., October 16, 1950, while working at Blair Gate, I saw
an object in the air over K-25 traveling in a northeast direction from the southwest.
It was traveling in a straight line and going very fast. The object was white or
silvery in color and round like a ball and was about the size of a baseball as seen
at the distance it was from me. It seemed to be very high.

At exactly 2:55 P.M., October 16, 1950, this object reappeared from the northeast at
a considerably lower altitude and traveling a lot slower than before. I stopped a car
that was coming in the gate in order to have witnesses to what I saw. The occupants
of the car were Troopers [redacted] and [redacted] going in to work. I pointed
out the object to Trooper [redacted] and we watched the object for several
minutes. This object was slowly circling in a wide circle and spinning very fast, that
is, the object itself was spinning around and around. The object drifted toward the
southwest and in just a few minutes it reappeared at a very high altitude, going back
into the northeast and going very fast. We watched the object disappear into the
northeast.

This information was phoned in to Headquarters immediately by the undersigned. About
fifteen minutes after the object disappeared into the northeast, an F-82 Fighter plane
showed up in the area where the object was last seen but at a speed of a thousand of
feet lower than the object which Troopers [redacted] and the undersigned saw and
reported.

radar tracking, both in azimuth and altitude. With this additional unit, the Oak Ridge Plant could be covered from a different direction and a cross check could be made of the operation of the radar at Knoxville ATC Base. In addition, Lt Col Willis requested of Air Weather Service that they furnish meteorological data on 13 Oct 50 and 28 through 30 Nov 50. This information is not yet available.

6. On 3 Dec 50, Lt Col J. W. Brewer discussed the problem with Col L. S. Harris, who recommended that further investigation of the problem be given to the Department of Intelligence, AMC, which is charged with this responsibility. Lt Col Seashore, AMC, and Col Dunn, AMC, were contacted by telephone and advised of the problem as it appeared at the moment.

7. On 4 Dec 50, Col Harris and Lt Col Willis conferred with Brig Gen Ages concerning action taken. Brig Gen Ages directed that the Intelligence Department, AMC, be contacted by telephone and instructed to proceed immediately with the technical investigation and render whatever assistance was necessary to the CONAC and Atomic Energy Commission.

8. Col Harris called Col Dunn, AMC, and advised him that the investigation was primarily a radar problem and stated that it appeared necessary that qualified electronic experts be dispatched immediately to secure technical information and to advise the Radar Unit at Oak Ridge.

CONCLUSIONS

9. Col Dunn stated that the Department of Intelligence, AMC, would keep D/I USAF advised of progress in the investigation. The Technical Capabilities Branch will assist in the coordination of the results of the investigation with other government agencies.

ACTION RECOMMENDED

10. Approval of action taken instructing the Intelligence Department, AMC to dispatch electronic personnel to Oak Ridge plant of the Atomic Energy Commission.

REMARKS:
On October 16, 1950, at approximately 2:55 P.M., Trooper stopped us at this Installation and showed us an object in the north that was traveling toward the northwest. It looked to be about 2,000 feet in the air and a white-silverish looking color, rotating in a counter clockwise manner. It was round in shape and going in a rather fast motion. This object was at a high altitude and seemed to come in sight and then disappear. It looked about the size of a ball and round at every angle we looked at it.

19 October 1950

The "Contract Guards" who guard the building at the NEPA project were warned by the NEPA Security Section to report any peculiarity, regardless of how silly or fantastic it might seem. These guards were unaware of the previous events concerning objects seen over Oak Ridge, but some of the guards had reported peculiar sounds during the evening of 16 October 1950.

Independent reports from different guards were received by the Security Section, NEPA, Oak Ridge. These reports were submitted by Guards and described hearing an intermittent noise resembling the blast of a jet fighter afterburner. Each noise lasted for about three and one half (3½) seconds and would recur frequently between 1900 hours and 2004 hours on 16 October 1950. Each noise would sound like a jet plane which had increased its thrust tremendously. The sounds seemed to leave the vicinity making an ascent almost vertical. None of the guards could see an object in the sky.

On 17 October 1950, Major L. E. Ronniger, Sr. Instructor, ORG Group, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, returned from Nashville, Tennessee, and visited an official of the Security Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Major Ronniger was amused when informed of the fantastic sights that some of the personnel at Oak Ridge had seen but then he recalled an incident which he thought was not connected to the "Objects Sighted over Oak Ridge." After having been away from Oak Ridge during Monday and Tuesday, the 16th and 17th of October 1950, and without knowledge of the occurrence (which had taken place except for the item about which he was being told (which had to do with visual sightings of the object), Major Ronniger stated that he had heard a noise at about 1800 hours on 15 October 1950 which he described exactly as the guards who heard a noise on the night of 16 October 1950. Major Ronniger, accompanied by his daughter, attempted to locate a jet fighter in the sky but could see nothing whatever.

The Radar crew of Detachment #2, 662nd AC and W Squadron, McGhee-Tyson Airport, Knoxville, Tennessee, did not get an image on their scope during either of these occurrences, according to Major R. C. Case.

NOTES: The above information was obtained on 17 October 1950 from Major L. E. Ronniger, Mr. George Rathman, Security Division, Atomic Energy Commission, and Mr. Gene Gaedjen, NEPA, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and John S. Davis, Atomic Energy Security Patrol.

The following is extracted from the files of the Security Patrol, Atomic Energy Commission, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This report was originally an OSI report:

"3. At 1900 hours, 20 June 1949, Mr. and [redacted], Tennessee, stated that at approximately 1200 hours, 19 June 1949, they sighted three unidentified objects flying from the southeast, over Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Mr. [redacted] first sighted the objects and called [redacted]'s attention to them. They watched the objects until they came into closer view. They described two of the objects as being rectangular in shape, and identical. The third object was described as circular in shape, and flying either in between or slightly above the two rectangular objects. The two rectangular objects appeared to be flat and flexible. The third object was flat but did not have a flexible appearance. The rectangular objects in traveling, followed a wave-like course, and appeared to be dark in color underneath, and of bright metal finish on top. Their movements were coordinated, and their reflection in traveling was light and dark. The rectangular objects seemed to have an area of from four to ten square feet. The circular object was described as being the color of frosted glass. This third object did not follow the wave-like movement of the rectangular objects, but maintained a level flight. There was no noise to indicate how these objects were being propelled. They remained in view from 10 to 15 minutes after being sighted, and when last seen were traveling in a northwest direction. During this time the objects did not appear to either gain or lose altitude. The weather was clear with the exception of high scattered cumulus clouds, and the wind which was from an easterly direction was very slight.

4. At 2000 hours, 20 June 1949, Mr. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted], Oak Ridge, Tennessee, stated that Mrs. [redacted], her neighbor, called her attention to the three flying objects sighted by the [redacted] at approximately 1200 hours, 19 June 1949, and that she watched them for approximately 10 minutes. Mrs. [redacted] description and details regarding the objects were the same as Mr. and Mrs. [redacted].

5. The witnesses of these objects are reputable people, and their statements are considered reliable. Mr. [redacted] is a biologist with the Oak Ridge National Laboratories, Mrs. [redacted] is a school teacher, and Mrs. [redacted] is the wife of one of the members of the Security Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Oak Ridge, Tennessee."

A. L. Rydzewski, Acting Assistant Chief, Security Division

REPORT OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECT

SYMBOL: SIAIE

Pursuant to receipt of a report from [redacted] Oak Ridge Patrol, indicating that a mysterious flying object was observed in the vicinity of the Kerr Hollow Entrance, [redacted] interviewed by F. P. Callaghan, Acting Chief, Security Division, AEC, GRO, in the presence of A. L. Rydzewski, Security Division, GRO, and Charles Jones, Security Agent, Mason Construction Company, at approximately 10:15 p.m. October 15, 1950.

Highlighter is an electrician employed by the Edgefield Electric Company, which is under subcontract with the Mason Construction Company, performing work at the K-29 plant. He was born June 24, 1896, and at present resides at the Edgewood Greenway Road, Knoxville. Eisenhower gave the following account of his observations. He was driving to work at approximately 3:15 p.m., October 15, 1950, and upon nearing the Kerr Hollow entrance to the Oak Ridge Controlled Area, he was requested by the guard and another civilian to stop and observe an object which the guard and another civilian were looking at. He got out of the car and noticed a white spot in the sky. He said it was "awful high" and moved from a position somewhat east of the guard and another civilian entrance in a westerly direction toward the Plant area. He noted that the sky was clear and the object was merely white, not shiny and emitted no trail of smoke and appeared to have no appendages. He observed the object for about 5 minutes and continued on his way to work before the white object disappeared from sight.

When asked what he thought of the object, [redacted] related that his first impression was that it might be a toy balloon, because it looked quite similar to a toy balloon which one of the neighborhood girls had released in his presence several weeks ago. [redacted] was not sure of the size or shape of the object, however he indicated by hand gesture that its might have been about 9 inches in diameter and probably was in the shape of a disc or ball.

[redacted] said that the guard and civilian appeared to be excited and told him that when they first saw it, the object was "quite big" and that it moved along the road at very low altitude and that it suddenly ascended at an angle to the point where they were observing it at the time. He stated that the guard originally asked him to look at the object, just to make sure that he wasn't merely imagining he was seeing things.

that he only had to use glasses for reading purposes. He had his eyes tested about 4 years ago by Dr. Grubs in Knoxville, at which time the reading glasses were prescribed.  He also had taken a pre-driver license eye test about 3 weeks ago at the Maxon First Aid Station.

stated that the only other person to whom he mentioned seeing the object was a guard stationed at Gate Two to the K-29 Plant.

Note: The Maxon Guard was later identified as being Jack Laxton, who was interviewed at approximately 1115 p.m. Laxton stated that a man was driving through the portal shortly after 3:00 p.m. and stopped to chat with him for about 5 minutes. The man stated that he had a headache and that he had been observing an object in the sky which called to his attention by a guard at the Kerr Hollow entrance. According to the man further related that the object was so high he didn't know what it was, but he looked more or less like a toy balloon. He was not excited by this report; however he did mention something about flying objects to a fellow guard about two hours later when they observed aircraft which they believed were P-38's flying over the plant areas.

Note: Other individuals who had observed the object were identified as AEC Patrolman E_________ and John _________ employee of the UT-AEC Farm.

Location: Kerr Hollow

[Portions of the form are blacked out, including some personal details]

Capt. [blacked out]
UT Farm 1817
Macon 6653

Stopped at Kerr Hollow gate where I was on duty October 15, 1950, 3:20 P.M. He and I observed what appeared to be a skywriter in the air. He was one-quarter of the way through a letter "O". The object appeared to be 12,000 to 15,000 feet high and east by north of the gate, approximately one mile distance from the gate. At this time, the size appeared to be about the size of a four or five passenger plane. The object had a smoke trail the same crossectional size of its body and about one-quarter of a mile long. The smoke was grayish in color. The color of the body of the object was silver metallic. The object gave off no reflection. It was all in appearance. When first observed, it was describing an arc toward the ground. When the object failed to complete the outside loop, I went into the gate house to report its appearance. Up till this time I thought it to be a plane doing some skywriting, while I was making the phone call [blacked out] watched the object continue downward to 1,500 feet. At that altitude, a second object was noticed alongside the smoke trail. The second object was about 50 feet behind the first object. The second object appeared to be attached to the first object's smoke trail with about an 80 degree forward thrust, yet the second object was moving in the same direction of the first object and not drawing away from the small trail of the first object the way it should have been doing according to its angle and direction. At this altitude, both objects changed from a bullet shape to a bladder shape. Also, at 1,500 feet, both objects began pulling out of the vertical dive, during the entire descent, both objects diminished in size. From 1,500 feet, the angle of descent was about 45 degrees. About 500 feet, the second or trailing object disappeared. The object continued downward to a point north of the perimeter fence over the roadway about 60 yards from the gatehouse toward Selway bridge. This was where the object was when I came out of the gatehouse. At this time, the object had diminished to about 2x5 inches.

The smoke trail had discontinued but there was a tail that had the appearance of a ribbon about 5 or 6 feet long. At time the tail lengthened to almost 20 feet. While hovering, it had a burn or dark brown appearance. The tail had an appearance gradually expanding with a dark line running down through the center of it. The main object was still grayish metallic in color. The object was hovering about 5 or 6 feet above the road in a generally stationary position. I was toward the object and the object started moving southward as I moved toward it. Then I got to within 50 feet of it, the main object was about 4 to 6 feet above the chain link fence on the south side of the road. It moved vertically up to about 12 feet then descended northeast across the fence, then it again moved straight up to about sixty feet where it again moved south over a 11.4 pole and a willow tree. After it passed over the willow tree, it changed direction to the southeast. A truck from the Macon Construction Company came along and I stopped him and asked him to observe it. He was unable to see the object at first and I returned to the gatehouse to make another report. I continued and came back into the gatehouse and seen after I went into the gatehouse, Hightower sighted the object. The object was now ascending at an angle of about 4.5 degrees in a southeast direction. As it moved away, it got larger in size and again assumed a pear or bladder shape. The object continued in this manner until it had passed over the ridge south of Solway road and disappeared.

About five minutes later, Capt. [redacted] drove up and as he came down the road I remarked that I wished it would show up again so he could see it. We looked toward the ridge and saw it again. The object was moving from west to east about 8 or 9 feet above the field south of the fence. Its speed was about 15 to 20 miles per hour. I motioned for Capt. [redacted] hurry out of his car. He came over to where we were standing on the first Island from the gatehouse. Capt. [redacted] looked to where I pointed and saw the object immediately. At this time, the object was about 200 feet high and ascending at about 45 degrees in a southeast direction. We saw 14 for about 60 seconds before it disappeared at about 1,500 to 2,000 feet. It had a bladder or pear shape at this time.

In about five more minutes, Hightower and I saw it again and again about 20 degrees above the center Island house. It had pear shape again and appeared to be about the same size as a small pear. The object was moving west about 20 miles per hour. It continued west about 50 feet above the road until west of the sun. This was the last time it appeared. None of us noticed any odor at any time.

When I first saw the object diving, its speed was very slow. It was much slower than a plane could dive. On the 45 degrees downward slant, it slowed even more. When it moved across the road, the speed was about 15 miles per hour. During the upward slant, the speed was much faster than the downward slant and it must have been increasing in size. At a draw west, we could see it, just as plainly and about the same size as when observed up close.

The wind direction was north-northwest and 6 MPH, according to the Knoxville Weather Station.

Saucers Bob Up—
Again In Reports
Ridge Informants Insist Object
Seen There Was 'Big As A House'

By BILL ANDERSON
OAK RIDGE, Oct. 25—Reports that an object like a flying saucer was seen near the top-secret nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft project here grew stronger today.

But they are all second hand reports like so many of the other stories about flying saucers.

The NEPA project is a joint effort by the Air Force, the Atomic Energy Commission, and several other agencies in the application of atomic energy to the propulsion of aircraft.

The reports, all unofficial and from private sources, described the object as "silver"—like an aluminum liner, and apparently of aluminum construction.

When in the air it was accompanied by the sound of jets," they said.

FIRST RIDGE REPORT
It was the first detailed report of such an object to appear in the atomic city.

AEC officials told The Journal that they have "no comment on such reports." The commission's press guard at the Los Alamos plant to fill out in case they fly the saucer. The forms were not distributed here.

The reports started to filter into the Journal Oak Ridge Bureau two weeks ago. They were at first discussed, due to the fact that on the same day the reports started the story of the AEC queries in Los Alamos appeared in The Journal.

Yesterday two reports were re-

Saucer Reports Bob Up
Again In Ridge Reports
Informants Say Aluminum Object Rose Near
Secret Project, Was 'Big As A House'
CONTINUED FROM PAGE ONE

The saucer-looking object was
seen late Thursday, Oct. 12—a
few hours before the storm appeared.

The following description was
given of the object: "It was round
and big as a four-room house. The
color was silver—like an airliner,
and it was of aluminum construction, or an element looking like
aluminum. There was a "blister"
at the top of the saucer, and it
had windows.

ROSE—AND SWOOSH!
"The object rose, very slowly,
for about 100 feet, and then moved
slightly forward. The Journal informant said, "Again it rose, about
the same distance up and forward
and then—swoosh! It was gone
at a fast rate of speed."

The person added that the object, during its fast flight, away
from the vicinity, seemed to "flatten out."

None of the sources questioned
by The Journal had seen the object; they had just talked to someone who said they had seen it.
And it was obvious that the person who said they saw it did
not realize what they were telling might fall under the head of
classified or secret information,
strict security rules cover all

classified material.

While the official AEC statement was "no comment," checks
with several other sources indicate a rumor of the same object
has made its rounds of the government buildings here.

In a routine check with various
officials connected with the project here, the following information was given to them, and then
a series of questions asked:
"Several persons working near
and around the NEPA project and
the K-25 plant have stated an
object, termed by them as a "flying saucer," was seen early Oct.
13 or late Oct. 12 in the K-25
area.

"Have you heard similar reports
of the same type objects near that
area or the NEPA project either
at those times or at an earlier
or later date?"

NO AEC COMMENT
Gordon Molesworth, assistant to
the manager for Public Information here, said, "no comment"
the questions.

Will Cole, public relations at
NEPA said "no."

Both offices said flatly that
there had been no "official" information passed on to them.
The latest quarterly report is
sued by the Office of Public Information for the AEC has a total to say about the atomic propulsion project, but no recent information as to progress at the plant.

Last week, one woman reported
to The Journal that her neighbor
had spotted what she had described as a flying saucer. Her
description placed the object flying in circles over the area for
some length of time. Earlier in
the same day, a fighter plane,
stationed in Knoxville for protectional purposes here, had been
flying over the area.

Previous reports during the past
year came from the usual run of
reporting flying saucers. One saucer turned out to be a weather balloon that had broken its ties with
the local weather station. Several
persons saw the balloon, which
accompanied by air pockets and
directional winds, plus a light fog
the weather observers, actually
appeared to be a saucer.

Another case was two jet plane.

stopped at Kerr Hollow gate where I was on duty October 15, 1950, 3:20 P.M. He and I observed what appeared to be a skywriter in the air. He was one quarter of the way through a letter "J". The object appeared to be 12,000 to 15,000 feet high and east by north of the gate, approximately one mile distant from the gate. At this time, the size appeared to be about the size of a four or five passenger plane. The object had a smoke trail the same cross sectional size of its body and about one quarter of a mile long. The smoke was grayish in color. The color of the body of the object was silvery metallic. The object gave off no reflection. It was dull in appearance. When first observed it was describing an arc toward the ground. Then the object failed to complete the outside loop. I went into the gate house to report its appearance. Up till this time I thought it to be a plane doing some skywriting. While I was making the phone call, at that altitude, a second object was noticed along side the smoke trail. The second object was the same size and shape and was about 50 feet behind the first object. The second object appeared to be attached to the first object's smoke trail with about an 80 degree forward thrust, yet the second object was moving in the same direction of the first object and not drawing away from the smoke trail of the first object the way it should have been doing according to its angle and direction. At this altitude, both objects changed from a bullet shape to a bladder shape, as 1,500 feet both objects began pulling out of the vertical dive. During the entire descent, both objects diminished in size. From 1,500 feet, the angle of descent was about 45 degrees. At about 500 feet, the trailing object disappeared. The object continued downward to a point north of the perimeter fence over the roadway about 60 yards from the gatehouse toward solitary bridge. This was where the object was when I came out of the gatehouse. At this time, the object had diminished to about 2 x 5 inches. The smoke trail had discontinued but there was a tail that had the appearance of a ribbon about 5 or 6 feet long. At times the tail lengthened to almost 20 feet. While hovering, it had a burnt or dark brown appearance. The tail had an opalescent, grayish appearance with a dark line running down through the center of it. The main object was still grayish metallic in color. The object was hovering about 5 or 6 feet above the road in a completely stationary position. I went toward the object and the object started moving southward as I moved toward it. Then I got to within 50 feet of it, the main object was about 4 to 6 feet from the chain link fence on the south side of the road. It moved straight up to about 12 feet and then described a horizontal movement southward across the fence, then it again moved straight up about sixty feet, again moved over a light pole and a willow tree. After it passed over the willow tree, it changed its direction to the southeast. At this time, a man of Eadon Construction Company, came along and I stopped him and asked him to observe it.

He was unable to see the object at first and I returned to the watchouse after I went into the gatehouse, continued to observed the object and soon lighted the object. The object was now ascending at an angle of about 45 degrees in a southeast direction. As it moved away, it got larger in size and again assured a pear or bladder shape. The object continued in this manner until it had passed over the ridge south of Solvay road and disappeared.

About five minutes later, Captain drove up and as he came down the road I remarked that I wished it would show up again so he could see it. We looked toward the ridge and saw it again. The object was moving from west to east about 8 or 9 feet above the field south of the fence. Its speed was about 15 to 50 miles per hour. I motioned Captain to hurry out of his car. He came over to where we were standing on the first island from the gatehouse. Captain looked to where I pointed and saw the object immediately. At this time, the object was about 200 feet high and ascending at about 45 degrees in a southeast direction. We saw it for about 60 seconds before it disappeared at about 1,500 to 2,000 feet. It had a bladder or pear shape at this time.

In about five more minutes, and I saw it again about 20 degrees above the center island house. It had a pear shape again and appeared to be about the same size as a small pear. The object was moving at about 20 miles per hour. It continued west about 50 feet above the road until we lost it in the glare of the sun. This was the last time it appeared. None of us noticed any odor at any time.

When I first saw the object diving, its speed was very slow. It was much slower than a plane could dive. On the 45 degree downward slant, it slowed even more. Then it moved across the road, the speed was about 15 miles per hour. During the upward slant, the speed was much faster than the downward slant and it must have been increasing in size because as it drew away, we could see it just as plainly and about the same size as when observed up close.

The wind direction was north-northwest and 8 12N, according to the Knoxville Weather Station.

1. In view of the nature of the work being carried out at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, plus the fact that reports on individual sightings were accompanied by radar observations, it was decided that the investigation of this particular case warrants your attention.

2. The type of radar used in detecting the unknown radar echoes described in Inclosure 1 is not given. However, based on the remarks contained therein, it is believed to have been an AN/CPS-1 radar operating at a frequency of approximately 3,000 mes. The frequency of operation, C.G., VF, UHF, GHF, has considerable bearing on possible explanations of spurious radar echoes.

3. Meteorological information is an almost absolute necessity in explaining spurious radar echoes. This data is lacking in Inclosure 1. The shape or signal characteristics of spurious echoes are also of considerable assistance in analyzing the situation. For instance, the signal returning from an aircraft would occupy, in range, a space on the scope equal to the pulse length in seconds multiplied by the speed of electrical impulses through air. Thus, a pulse of one microsecond length multiplied by 1056.000 (the speed of electromagnetic waves through air) would paint a target on the scope which would occupy 0.186 miles range. Spurious signals due to weather conditions always occupy more range than that from a single target and have a more rapid bearing and/or changing of signal strength than that obtained from adjacent aircraft targets.

4. The echoes briefly described in Inclosure 1 are considered to be very similar to those obtained on the scope of the SCR-584 at Wright-Patterson AF Base on 8 March 1950. Fighter aircraft were vectored towards the spurious echoes at Wright-Patterson AF Base, but no targets were seen by the fighter pilots. However, the plotted return of ice-laden clouds at 10,000 foot altitude. The ice conditions of these clouds were considered to be responsible for the spurious echoes and the changing ice conditions of the clouds are believed to have caused the signal strength to fluctuate and to appear to be moving at various speeds.

5. The spurious radar echoes described in Inclosure 1 are believed to have been caused by atmospheric conditions. Atmospheric conditions

causing spurious microwave radar echoes usually consist of rain, heavily water-laden clouds, and low-lying clouds. Abnormal temperature changes with altitude are usually associated with these atmospheric conditions and may be responsible to some extent for the spurious echoes.

6. While it is impossible to definitely explain the phenomena observed visually by people in the area, many of the details reported follow the pattern of reports on other incidents on which conclusions were drawn to the effect that popular sun weather balloons, peculiar clouds or smoke formations, aircraft through an overcast, etc. Evidence tends to show that in most cases a close look at the effect that such sightings were made by numerous people usually between 10 and 15 miles, and the number of subsequent reports is usually determined by the publicity surrounding the incident.

7. In the event any photographs are available on recent sighting at Oak Ridge, Air Materiel Command is desirous of securing copies for evaluation.
