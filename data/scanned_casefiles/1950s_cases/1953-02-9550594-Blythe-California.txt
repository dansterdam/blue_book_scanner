On 4 February 1953 at about 1650 hours I was aboard B-36 aircraft 51-1372 over Desert Center, California at 20,000 feet. At that time the Navigator called my attention to an unidentified object above and behind the aircraft. I checked our position and found it to be about 5 miles east of Desert Center. I then went back to the left forward sighting blister and observed the object itself. It seemed in a bright white ball, much brighter than the high cirrus clouds behind it. I would estimate altitude at 40,000 feet and its position 30 miles off the aircraft. Its motion was stationary. The sun was behind me as I looked at the object, about 150 above the western horizontal. This object did not appear to me to be an aircraft or a weather balloon. I have no further opinion as to its identity.

On 4 February 1953, at 1650 on a flight from Cardwell WB, Texas to Travis AFB, California I observed a white object much higher than our aircraft. It was at approximately 6:30 o'clock high. It appeared to be moving slightly, as it moved the sun rays were reflected off it. I observed it first with clouds as a background, then it appeared cleared as it moved out of the clouds. It was brought to my attention by the main navigator. I observed it from the right nose forward window for approximately 10 minutes.

On 4 February 1953, at 1850 hours Pacific standard time I sighted
a object above and behind the aircraft. It was of round shape and of
light color. It seemed to be raising very slowly. I observed it for
approximately 10 minutes. The reflection of the sun made it appear to
change its shape slightly. This sighting was made from the lower at
left blister.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: 91st Strat Recon Sq
56th Street Wing (H)
Travis AFB, Calif.

REPORT NO.

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

While flying on a ferry mission from Fort Worth, Texas to Travis AFB, California in the vicinity of Blythe, California, an RB-36 crew of the 91st Strat Recon Squadron, 56th Street Wing (H), observed a unidentified object. The RB-36 was maintaining a trim air speed of 200 knots, a ground speed of 180 knots, and a true heading of 233 degrees at an altitude of 30,000 feet. The time of the sighting was 0950 SCT, 5 February 1953, and the aircraft's exact position at the time of the sighting was 32-13N, 115-11W. The sighting was observed for approximately 5 minutes at which time the object disappeared from view behind clouds. It was a white round object appearing brighter than the stratus clouds behind it. It was sighted at seven (7) o'clock low with a parabolic 20 mile radius of action. The crew was flying a straight level course. No definite movement of direction was made while observed.

The statements made were slightly conflicting due to each observer's different viewing angle of the object. The air altitude was estimated to be approximately 30,000 to 50,000 feet. No vapor trails were observed. The object appeared similar to a full moon and like a metal surface with reflecting sun rays. The object was not thought to be an aircraft or a weather balloon.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the sighting reported was observed as stated in each of the crew member's statements, and it is definitely worthy of a flying object report.

This image appears to be a map with multiple lines, intersections, and annotations. Some partially legible text fragments I can make out include:

"WORLD AERONAUTICAL CHART"
"CAUTION AREA"

The map is complex with many intersecting lines, grid markings, and what seem to be geographical or navigational reference points. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document with some degradation and edge wear.

On the 4th of February 1953 I was scheduled to Ferry Aircraft 52-1372, an B-36, from Convair Aircraft Company to Travis AFB, California. While flying on airways from Blythe to Riverside my pilot reported an object at seven (7) o'clock high. The time was 1850 pacific standard time and we were located approximately 5 miles East of Desert Center, California, flying at 20,000 feet. The object appeared to be the same as sun rays reflecting off of a metal surface. No vapor trails were visible from the object. Its relation to our aircraft showed the same, for example like a star or the sun does while flying on a similar course. I could not determine the distance of this object. It disappeared behind a cloud 5 times after I first saw it.

On a ferry trip from Ft. Worth, Texas to Travis AFB, California on 4 February 1953 at 1850 pacific standard time, Captain David Smith the pilot sighted an object through the navigator's straddome at 1:50 o'clock high. He called my attention to it and I looked out the navigator's straddome and saw a white object which appeared to be round in shape. As to size and how high the object was above us I could not say but it appeared to be about the size of an aircraft which is at 30,000 feet above the ground. The object appeared not to move while I was observing it.

The exact location was 39-43 North latitude and 116-16 west longitude. The altitude of the flight was 30,000 feet. The true heading was 290°. The true airspeed was 250K and the ground speed was 180K. The object was sighted at 1850 Pacific standard time and was observed for approximately 5 minutes.

1b 1650 Pacific Standard Time on 4 February 1953 while 12 miles NE
of Wilton 3w approaching Palm Springs Intersection I observed a spinning
object above us and to the rear (3 about 7 o'clock). It didn't have wing
tip aileron aircraft. As were 4 20,500 feet heading about 270 westerly.

The object appeared considerably lighter than a star, I would rate 50-60
feet altitude; 3 deg in the pitch seat at a plot and observed the object
move by itself through the interval.

On a ferry trip from Ft. Worth, Texas to Travis AFB, California on 4 February 1953 at approximately 1850 pacific standard time someone sighted an object in the sky at "7" o'clock light.

I looked out the window at the engineers station and saw a round white object similar to a full moon in every respect except size of diameter and size at an indeterminate altitude. After flying about seven (7) or eight (8) minutes a few miles north of Blythe that was approximately 5,000 feet above us (our altitude was 20,300). This gave us an opportunity to judge the height of this disk as being 20,300 feet. I would estimate the size as being 15 to 20 feet across. The object made no movement while we observed it, if it descended it was a very small amount. The exact location was 33-43N - 115-15W.
