UNCLASSIFIED

On 4 February 1953 at about 1835 hours I was observing 1-25 lights objects northwest of Desert Center, California at 23,000 feet. At that time the navigator called my attention to an unidentified object above and behind the aircraft. I checked the position and found it to be about 5 miles east of Desert Center. I then went back to the 1-25 lights forward of the aircraft and continued to observe them. They moved much faster than the light objects behind the aircraft. I would estimate the altitude as 20,000 feet and the cruising speed 25 miles per hour of the aircraft. The motion was erratic. The sun was behind me as I looked toward the object. This object did not appear to be an airborne vehicle of a weather balloon. I have no further opinion as to the identity.

OCR output:

On the 4th of February 1953 I was scheduled to ferry aircraft 53-1379, an F-84 G, from Convair Aircraft Company to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona.

While flying on airways from Blythe to Riverside by Blythe, California, I was at 19,000 feet and had the autopilot engaged. The time was 2550 hours Pacific Standard Time and as I was approximately 3 miles west of Brawley, California, flying I noticed a bright light some 2000 feet above me. The object appeared to be the same size as the star reflecting off of a metal surface. No vapor trail was visible from the object. It's relation to my aircraft showed the object was, for a period of 30 seconds, stationary in relation to my aircraft. after this sighting the object accelerated at a very rapid rate and disappeared within 3 seconds. The whole sighting lasted approximately 30 secs.

On a ferry trip from El Norte, Texas to Blythe, California on 9 February 1953 at approximately 2650 Pacific Standard Time, the witness sighted an object in the sky at 7 o'clock high.

I looked out the window and saw a round, bright light which was much brighter than any star. This bright object appeared to be hovering or stationary at an indeterminate altitude.

(7) or slightly (8) minutes - a glow appeared near the bright light, was approximately 20 feet above the bright light. This glow was an indefinite shape and could have been a reflection from the bright light.

The bright light disappeared at this time. The total time of the observation was about 5 to 10 minutes.

The location was 11-48N - 114-15W.
