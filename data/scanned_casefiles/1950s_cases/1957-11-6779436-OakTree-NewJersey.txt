[Letterhead location] Oak Park, New Jersey

[Date] November 6, 1957

Mitchell Air Base
Long Island
New York

Gentlemen:

On November 6, approximately 11:55 p.m., while traveling west in Oaklyn, New Jersey, a small town adjacent to south Palmyra, Mr. Jersey, a resident of this area, observed a bright light just in the upper left hand corner of his windshield and watched with great attention. A vehicle called over to the roadside and he watched this bright spot until it disappeared.

At this time, the light silvery at that time, left no vapor trail, seemed to be in a climbing west and up to a position, approximately 300 degrees, or west northwest. The object was clearly visible, and it seemed to rise into the sky. Describing the above is difficult, but it seemed to be a light phenomenon.

I am forwarding this information to you in advice of Mr. Garden.

Very truly yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]
