STAR - NO STAR WHICH
APPEARS IN THE S W CAN
PASS THROUGH THE ZENITH OR NEAR THE
ZENITH OF AN OBSERVER IN THE
NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ... UNLESS
TOTE OBSERVER DID NOT MAKE
A CONTINUOUS OBSERVATION
AND SAW TWO DIFFERENT
STARS THE ABOVE REASON
RULES OUT 2 STARS AS A
POSSIBLE SOLUTION.

BALLOON - FOR A BALLOON
TO TRAVEL FROM THE
HORIZON TO THE ZENITH
IT WOULD - BE HAVE A
NECESSARY PACE A SPEED

Here is the text from the document:

15 NO WEAPON WHICH
INDICATES THAT THE
WITNESS DID NOT OBSERVE
MUCH BEYOND
AIRCRAFT

AIRCRAFT: THE WITNESS IS AN EXPERIENCED
PILOT AND IT CAN BE ASSUMED
THAT HE SHOULD RECOGNIZE
AIRCRAFT CLIENTS...
ANOTHER FACTOR WHICH TENDS
TO DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY
OF AIRCRAFT IS THAT
AIR TRAFFIC IN THE
LABRADOR AREA IS
PROBABLY CHECKED MORE
CLOSELY THAN IN THE
UNITED STATES. THE REPORT
MENTIONED THAT NO AIRCRAFT
COULD BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS SIGHTING.

THE CAUSE FOR THIS
SIGHTING IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER
IN KEEPING WITH OUR POLICY
CONCERNING "ONE - WITNESS"
REPORTS, THIS CASE IS CLOSED.
