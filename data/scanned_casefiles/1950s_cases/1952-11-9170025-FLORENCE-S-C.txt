The object was described as cigar-shaped, approximately 50-75 feet long, and with a reddish-orange glow emanating from the rear of the object. The witnesses stated that the object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes, and during this time it made a sharp 180 degree turn towards Fox weather, 71/8/252/. They also stated that the object then accelerated to an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from view. No sound or trail was observed and no maneuvers or conditions, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.
