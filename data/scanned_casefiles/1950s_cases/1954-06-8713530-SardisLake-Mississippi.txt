Strange Object
May Be Portion
Of Data Balloon

SARDIS, Miss. Sept. 21.--Officials of the Air Force and U.S. Engineers opened an investigation here Tuesday to determine the identity of a mysterious object which plummeted from the skies into Lake Sardis some months ago.

U.S. Engineer Jack Stewart, chief of dam and reservoir at Sardis, announced that U.S. Engineers recovered the object Monday when receding waters in the huge reservoir left it exposed to view.

Engineers had inspected the lake once very week for evidence of the strange object which fell near J. P. Phillips, a Como, Miss., fisherman, some six months ago.

Mr. Stewart said the recovered article, which was taken to the Sardis Field engineer's office, was "a plastic case, measuring 4 by 10 by 3 inches with parachute harness and containing metal radio tube and wires." He said the number LU-2450-AN-AL was found inscribed on the case.

Capt. Virgil Russ, assistant flying safety officer at Greenville Air Force Base, was called into the investigation late Tuesday afternoon on the assumption that the object might be connected with the Air Force.

"We don't have any idea as to the identity of the apparatus," Mr. Stewart said. "The thing doesn't look too complicated but 'investigating may and Wednesday or it may go on for days,'" he added.

Air Force officials at Greenville said, though, that it couldn't have come from Greenville because the base doesn't release weather balloons.

As to when positive identity of the object will be made, Mr. Stewart said he couldn't tell. "Doesn't look too complicated but 'investigating may end Wednesday or it may go on for days,'" he added.

SARDIS MYSTERY BOX
IS AIR FORCE RADIO
Greenville Base Identifies It
As Lost Transmitter

From The Commercial Appeal
GREENVILLE, Miss., Sept. 22.—

A mysterious object which
dropped from the sky into Lake
Sardis three months ago was
identified by Greenville Air Force
Base officials Wednesday as a
Signal Corps radio transmitting
device.

Dam and Reservoir officials at
Sardis had kept up a weekly surveillance of the lake after J. P.
Phillips, a Como, Miss., fisherman, reported seeing a strange
object fall near his boat three
months ago.

Capt. Virgil Kuns, Assistant
Flying Safety Officer at the Greenville base, was called to identify
the object after receding waters
at Sardis Reservoir Monday uncovered a "plastic case, measuring 8 by 10 by 4 inches, and containing 10 by 4 metal radio tubes and
wires."

Captain Kuns and other Greenville Air Force Base officials
identified the apparatus as a
signal transmitter which is
dropped from carrier planes
to mark the spot where parachuters are to bail out.

The apparatus transmits a weak
radio signal which is picked up
by the troop carrying aircraft.
Air Force officials said the transmitter probably fell by accident
from a passing plane.

27 September 1954

SUBJECT: Fallen Object - Sardis Lake, Mississippi

FROM: The Area Engineer, Greenwood Area Office, U.S. Corps of Engineers, Sardis, Miss.

TO: The District Engineer, Vicksburg District, U.S. Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg, Miss.

1. On 9 June 1954, between 9:00 and 10:00 A.M., [redacted] who was fishing in the Hayes Crossing area, which is approximately 12 miles northwest of Sardis, Miss., observed a [redacted].

2. [Redacted] noticed an object approximately one mile distant and descending. The object, described by [redacted] as being small and round and seemed to be enveloped in a blue flame from a source of heat. The object hit the water about three hundred feet from the shore. In a short while, three or four F-84 jets piloted by Phillips staked out the water after the splash. The object floated on the surface for almost an hour rising from the water. It then disappeared in the water.

3. [Redacted] and reservoir personnel visited the site on the afternoon of 14 June 1954. A search was made in probing when [redacted] pointed out the location where he thought the object had fallen. Probing continued on 14 June by the Sardis Reservoir Manager and others, but in an area once or twice each week after the object was reported fallen.

4. The object was found at 3:30 P.M. on 20 September 1954 by Sardis reservoir personnel. Reservoir stages had fallen sufficiently by this time to expose the apparatus. The object was a plastic case approximately 4 ft. x 1 ft. x 6 inches, with parachute harness, and containing metal, radio tubes and wires. The appending was taken to Sardis Dam Field Office where Captain Virgil Kuns, assistant flying safety officer, Greenville Air Force Base, examined it. At this time, the Air Force Officer handling the object to examine it was Captain W.C. Beasley.

5. According to a newspaper article in the Commercial Appeal dated 22 September, reservoir workers had found a strange object which is believed to be a weather balloon. The article further stated that the strange object was found in the lake and was a weather balloon.

Dear Colonel Simpson:

Thank you very much for your letter of October 5th containing a complete report of the fallen object at Sardis Lake, Mississippi.

As you are probably aware, for the past several years the air force has had a major survey program in this area and reports such as yours, which involve considerable time on your part, are greatly appreciated.

For your convenience I am attaching a copy of the "U. S. Air Force Summary of Events and Information Concerning the Unidentified Flying Object Program," which comprises all of the latest facts which have been established by the Air Force in its program in this area.

Thank you again for your interest in keeping the Air Force informed.

Very truly yours,

Signed

REFER TO FILE NO. IMKVE                                   6 October 1954.

SUBJECT:   Fallen Object - Sardis Lake, Mississippi.

TO:        Intelligence Officer, U. S. Air Force,
            Washington, D. C.

1.   On 8 June 1954, Mr. [redacted], Miss., stated that he saw a strange object fall near where he was fishing in Sardis Lake, near Sardis, Miss. Since Sardis Lake is a Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, lake and dam, it was decided to contact Mr. [redacted] and make an effort to locate the object. Mr. [redacted] was contacted and he gave the general location where the object supposedly fell.

It was determined at that time that the object was in several feet of water and could not be located. Since the normal plan of operation of our reservoir called for the reservoir to be gradually lowered during the summer months, it was felt that the object would be exposed within a couple of months and perhaps could be recovered. Close observation was maintained and the object was recovered on 20 September 1954. Air Force personnel from the Greenville Air Base were contacted and identified the object as a Signal Corps radio transmitting device. A copy of report pertaining to this object is attached hereto, as Inclosure 1, for your information.

2.   In view of the frequent reports that are made in the papers concerning unidentified objects, it is believed that this information would be of value in your office for clearing up at least one unconfirmed report.

Inclosure:
No. 1 - Report w/2 
         newspaper clippings.
