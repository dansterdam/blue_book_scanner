UFO OBSERVER
8 JULY 1954

On the night of July 3, 1954 at 2336 hrs. more, monitoring
radar at an unidentified location near Bermuda, a small
circular area was under surveillance.

There on his screen was a clear and well-defined formation of one
circular object surrounded by a smaller circular objects. They appeared
near the surface of the ocean, a mile or so offshore. There were no
check if an equipment malfunction existed or if the objects were
ground. The radar observer had called the navigator, then the
aircraft commander, to observe the objects.

At this point the radar scope camera was turned on the set and a
number of frames taken before the objects went out of range. Meanwhile, a check indicated no radar activity in the area.

The radar operator who had 10 years in service, 3500 radar hours
and 150 hours as a radar observer, stated that he was familiar with
ship and aircraft tracking patterns, and this was the most peculiar return
he had encountered in his ten years of service, concluding with "I've
seen ships before on the scope - in fact, I was tracking one before
these things" and showed no indication of nervousness, and not a
cloud present.

The photos were examined, and other informal checks and investigations
made. Blips on the photo were valid objects, as compared to the
numerous radar photos of spurious returns, which suddenly appear and
disappear.

A detailed check with the Navy revealed that the objects seen were
definitely a Navy vessel in company with six destroyers and one
submarine, enroute from the Mediterranean area to a U.S. Base.

AC-36 aircraft flying over the Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda reported receiving a peculiar radar return on the night of [illegible date]. The return consisted of a clear and well defined circular formation containing 7 and at times 8 objects.


- page 25 -

Photographs were taken of the scope and were included with the report. The operator reported that no naval activity was observed and that this was the most peculiar return he had encountered in his 10 years of experience.


- page 26 -

An inquiry to the Navy produced the definite identification of these reported objects as having been an aircraft carrier accompanied by six destroyers and one submarine enroute from Naples to Norfolk.
