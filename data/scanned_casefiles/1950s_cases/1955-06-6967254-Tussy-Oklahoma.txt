4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: ■ Ground-Visual □ Ground-Radar □ Air-Visual □ Air-Intercept Radar

5. PHOTOS: □ Yes ■ No

6. SOURCE: Civilian

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Five (5) Seconds

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One (1)

9. COURSE: ESE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
One (1) round, green object, the size of the room with a fuzzy outline appeared through the windshield of the observers' car for a period of five (5) seconds and then faded. The object seemed to have a orange colored tail that was approximately three (3) times the size of the object in length. The tail appeared to be "cut off" in a straight line and did not come to a point. The course of the object was a level flight path to the ESE.

11. COMMENTS:
Due to the delay in transmission authorized, a check of maps and radio facility charts failed to reveal any beacons or flight paths in the area of sighting. The fading of the object and its close proximity of the two colors would tend to eliminate the reflection possibility. In the opinion of this hqs the sighting was generated by astronomical activity, i.e., meteorite.

This report was received by AF Form 112.
