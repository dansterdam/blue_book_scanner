Most of the text on this page is illegible or redacted. There appears to be some handwritten text in the bottom right corner of the page, but it is too blurry to read clearly. The page appears to be a document with multiple sections blacked out, leaving most of the page blank.

    Two (2) balloons with two strings of lights dragging. Appeared as a string of lights moving through the air. Moving slowly in ESE course.

11. COMMENTS
    This analyst spoke to Lt Davenport, one of the pilots who took intercept action on the objects. The objects were definitely established to be two balloons, at 19,500 and 17,000 feet respectively. The balloons appeared to be connected by a long cable. Lights hanging from where all along the cable. Although this was a rather unusual balloon sighting, evaluation of this headquarters is "was balloon."

Case 185, Denver, Colo., Aug. 12, 1956-Mrs. Mary McCaffrey and son were going west from the window of their room on the eighth floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel when they saw the water move east from the mountains. "It was bigger than the Target airplane and the edges were clearly defined," the said the Rock Mountain News.

It had been hovering over the city and they could see it plainly for several minutes. Then sky and weather stationary was at rest. It was a big, bright object with lights floating in the sky over and near Arvada Heights in the N.W. the Dept. and Lowry AFB Police Sgt. Jim Mullen and other observers looked at the lights which floated and bobbed in the northeast. He said they looked like they were suspended from balloons.

Other observers said the lights changed colors.
