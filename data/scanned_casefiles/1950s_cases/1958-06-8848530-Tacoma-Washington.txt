[Handwritten text]
Our June 26, 1958. I was called
to Northport Neb. After had seen a light
in the sky and wanted someone else
to see it.

Looking about southeast from the front
of shed, however, while as out in the country.

I saw a bright orange or white light
about the size of a barn hole. More
from left to right, then down, so that
it almost went into the ground - then
about back up into the sky, about
30°. Then due to a heavy fog which
was coming in at the time, faded from sight.


- page 26 -

I see handwritten text on the page, but parts of it are difficult to read with complete certainty. Here's what I can discern:

Page 10 is noted in the top right corner.

The handwritten text appears to read:

"I believe it was light, was something more spectacular a/or hallucination. Caused from... before, in that Samuel... direction, that the light, and a body of water, caused this..."

Some words are partially illegible or unclear, so I've represented those with ellipses or approximations.

Here is the text I can discern from the image:

There are also some handwritten notations on the diagram, including:
9:20 PM
10 min.
30 sec.
4 sec.

The image appears to be a celestial or navigational diagram showing a spherical projection with a horizon line and a city/landscape silhouette at the bottom.

Dear Senator Smith;- In regard to the enclosed,as written by Col.Boyd B White of the Dow Air Force ,Feb.12th 1959. As you will see that the letter is dated back in '59,with the idea of me getting back the $&& pictures;now it wasn't pictures I gave him,it was negatives,but be as it may,I sure would like to have them back,and was wondering if you could hurry things up a little by investigating the said problem.

I would like to have them,as quite a few people are awfully interested in the subject (flying Objects) and the picture I have left are very interesting to them.

As you haven't heard from me for quite some time, will say that I was a friend of ______'s quite a while ago;they have sold the house he lived in at Winterport.

Dear [redacted]:

I am writing in reply to your query concerning your photographs. Shortly after your initial sighting, I sent a qualified officer to investigate the situation. His information, together with the photographs that you sent me, were given to Air Intelligence for their review and analysis.

Past records have shown that sightings such as you have made, are usually attributed to natural phenomena. Even so, the Air Intelligence takes great pains to study all available information and photographs in order to ascertain the innocence of such incidents. As of this date, I have not received your photographs from the Intelligence people. Upon receipt, however, they will be forwarded to your residence.

Sincerely,
