RADAR-TRACKED SIGHTING
7. DETAILS ON AIR INTELLIGENCE

A radar object was observed by the Air Defense System whose characteristics approximately met the standard Rube Goldberg Military specification. The object was discovered at approximately 15,000 feet altitude moving south at approximately 9,500 miles per hour. Two radar units observed the object over a 20 minute period, and noted that the object made several directional changes and deflections. At one point, it changed course from 120 degrees to 180 degrees without a noticeable reduction in speed.

The object was tracked until it disappeared from the radar screen at a distance of 100 nautical miles from the observer. The observer noted that the object had violated no protocols and did not appear hostile.

8. Disposition:
The radar record and the observer's report attached to this document have been forwarded for analysis.

7. (a) The specific nature and characteristics of the object have yet to be determined. No further sighting reports have been received from this area.

(b) The sequence of radar reports from the object has been placed in a pending file and will be reviewed further.

9. Further actions:
Additional radar tracking stations in the area have been informed and have been requested to remain on alert for similar objects. Further instructions will be forwarded to analyzing stations as needed.

2. DATE AND PLACE ACQUIRED: 19 August 1955, Klamath Palls, Oregon
                                   Date: 22 August 1955

3. PRC-31. F-75-10471. Subj:  UFO Sighting

4. ABSTRACT: Complies with paragraph 21, AFPR 200-2

"UnassT-ified" Classification: "

5. DETAIL: At about 9 a.m. 19 August 1955, a heavy mist in process of lifting near Manna Pools-Ranch Kerker Krumhurn State who had taken a cottage here for a week, reported a metallic object with what looked like ripe yellow bands bouncing over the metallic having, and disappeared.

The reports will be seen to throw a large mystery this entire incident as there seems no way of verifying the whole thing, only say we believe them implicitly since they are reported as reliable sources. Fear of ridicule being connected to the AF prompted the USNR to request us to take all details. 

In conclusion, the objects observed seemed to be the size of mouth fishfood and not bird or insect, clouds of birds may have made the objects. 

It is reported that this type basin is not one over sea-level in this region, being in moist proof to establish further if much can be added to this ascertain report "
