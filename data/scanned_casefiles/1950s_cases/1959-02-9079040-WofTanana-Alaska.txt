SURVEILLANCE LARGE BALLOON BY COMPANY NOW PROBABLE CEASED OR BECAME UNRELIABLE AT 150152. SINCE PLOTS BECOME ERRATIC FOLLOWING THAT TIME, IT IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE THAT TARGET AND ORBITING AIRCRAFT BECAME CONFUSED. SO IT IS BELIEVED THE TARGET FELL STRAIGHT TO EARTH AT OR VERY NEAR THE POINT OF THE SUCCESSIVE FIRING PASS AT 0148Z, BLME 1557. AT IS BELIEVED ALL OR A PORTION OF THE BALLOON ENVELOPE FLAILED OR BROKE LOOSE FROM THE BOX AND FLOATED EARTHWARD AT A MORE LEISURELY RATE RESULTING IN SUBSEQUENT TARGET REPORTING. PARA 5 THE TARGET PAYLOAD PROBABLY STRUCK THE EARTH AT OR NEAR THE TERMINAL VELOCITY FORCE RESULTING IN RUPTURE AND BURYING IN SNOW. DARKNESS AND POOR WEATHER HAVE PREVENTED SEARCH OF THE AREA. PARA. 6. RESULTS OF SEARCH EFFORTS ARE BEING REPORTED TO NORAD THROUGH OPERATIONAL CHANNELS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS OBJECT IS FOUND. AT THAT TIME WE WILL FORWARD THROUGH NORMAL

DTD 14 FEB 59. IF THE PILOT'S ESTIMATE OF SIZE IS CORRECT, THE BALLOON WAS TOO SMALL TO BE A SEEHOOK BALLOON. A CHECK FAILS TO REVEAL ANY PROJECT IN OPERATION THAT UTILIZES THIS TYPE BALLOON, OR ONE THAT WOULD HAVE DRIFTED TO ALASKA. IT IS POSSIBLE THE BALLOON COULD HAVE DRIFTED OVER FROM USSR TERRITORY, OR BEEN RELEASED FOR THIS PURPOSE. HOWEVER, WHERE THE BALLOON CAME FROM OR ITS SPECIFIC PURPOSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED UNLESS THE BOX IS RECOVERED AND SUCCESSFULLY ANALYZED.
