AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: CLEVELAND
REPORT NO.: 2253
DATE: 9 JUNE 1952

1. On 22 June 1952, the Air Intelligence officer was notified that a flight of jet aircraft had received a visual sighting of an unidentified object on 20 June 1952. The object was sighted in the vicinity of Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, at approximately 1500 hours local time. 

The object was first observed at an approximate altitude of 20,000 feet. It was traveling in an easterly direction at an estimated speed of 500 knots. The object passed under the flight of jet aircraft at an estimated distance of 3 to 5 miles. No unusual maneuvers were observed and the object appeared a bright red or orange in color.

No confirmation can be made as to the origin or identity of the object. Its speed and reported altitude are considered beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. It is believed that the object was not a natural phenomenon such as a meteor or a reflection from some surface. At the present time, no conclusive evidence can be established as to the nature of this sighting.

No other sightings of a similar nature were reported in the area at the time of this incident.

The image appears to contain a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The report describes the object as a "large illuminated oblong-shaped object" with a "very smooth surface" that appeared to be "illuminated by an intense yellow-white light from the surface". The object was observed on June 27, 1952 at Lamoyne, Pennsylvania, and was seen to be traveling southward and altering its course, with the observation estimated to last three or four seconds.

DESCRIPTION: At 23:22 EST, 27 June 1952, at Lamoyne, Pa., a civilian observer reported observing an unidentified flying object. The object was described as a large illuminated oblong-shaped object with a very smooth surface. It appeared to be illuminated by an intense yellow-white light from the surface. The object was traveling southward and then altered its course. The observation was estimated to be three or four seconds.
RELIABILITY: This office can give no definite explanation of the sighting. However, a commercial airliner a Martin B-52 - was reportedly in the Lamoyne area at the time by the Harrisburg Municipal Airport tower. A civilian guard claims to have definitely identified the object as a Commercial airliner.

Arthur Bidlack, 1952

Middleboro, Pa.

June 25, 1952

The night of June 20, 1952, at 11:35 o'clock, my husband and I observed a strange object in the sky which I shall describe.

The object was oblong in shape and moved rapidly and silently. It had no lights as such, but the object itself appeared to glow, somewhat like a fluorescent light. Its path was erratic and it made sudden turns and stops. This strange object was in sight for several minutes before disappearing.

- page 16 -

This image appears to contain handwritten text, but no photographs. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text from the document:

The sighting of the object was north and had a very high speed. It moved westerly and had many lights which were a part of the object and it seemed to be very high. The search light was a steady beam, not a flashing light. Red lines in the object were a part of the design. The object was very high and moved very fast, seeming to take no time at all to go across the sky. We did not hear any sound. The object was brightly lit and had some form of propulsion that was not visible. We observed the object for only a minute or so.

- page 17 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a document containing handwritten text.

The text on the image is as follows:

At a tremendous speed the object seemed to disappear as it traveled in an erratic manner with the horizon as a background. This was a vivid moving light, a bright luminous object, the size of an automobile, which appeared and disappeared. The object was not larger than the size of a man's head when viewed against the horizon. The object was very high and moved extremely fast, much faster than any known aircraft.

I have seen many comets and I'm familiar with the stars, but this was no comet or star. This was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It was not reflecting sunlight. It seemed to have a power source of its own and there was no exhaust trail. The trajectory was so erratic, much different from that of a meteor or satellite, and the speed unbelievable. I would estimate it to have been traveling at a minimum of 2,000 mph.

INCIDENT: SIGHTING OF AN UNUSUAL AERIAL OBJECT
EVALUATION: UNUSUAL
SUMMARY: At approximately 10:12 PM CDT, 25 June 1952, the on-duty officer at the Abilene Air Force Base Radar site observed on the radar scope a target which was traveling at extremely high speed and made a sharp turn. The target was observed for approximately 1 minute 20 seconds before it disappeared from the scope. The object was estimated to be traveling at a speed in excess of 1,800 mph and made a sharp turn of approximately 30 degrees. The object was not tracked by any other radar installations and no visual sightings were reported. It is the opinion of the radar operators that the target was a genuine one and not a false echo or malfunction of the equipment.

STATEMENT

On the morning of 23 June at 1104, I drove home from the club, but my car the garage and I walked out to see how the weather was in the morning for golfing.

The sky immediately above was clear. There were stars visible and there was no moon. To the north and the north east there was a sudden bright flash which was a 'lightening' flash. As I was looking up, I noticed this blue light moving across the sky from southwest to northeast. My first impression was that it was a meteor. But upon closer examination, I say [sic] that the speed was much too slow and that it was not the usual trail of a shooting star. As I continued to watch the object, a blue light appeared to pulsate around the object. The object continued in a straight line at an apparent constant altitude to the northeast. As the object reached the horizon, the light went out and no sound could be heard. I would estimate the altitude at between 15 and 25 thousand feet, and the speed somewhat faster than a jet. The object disappeared behind a cloud and could not be the reappearment.

[REDACTED]
Report of Investigation of Unidentified Object Sighted in the Air on 24 August 1952.
At 2130 hours, 24 August 1952, I received a telephone call from [REDACTED], who stated that he had observed a strange object in the air over [REDACTED] at approximately 2115 hours, 24 August 1952. He stated that the object appeared to be round and giving off a red glow. [REDACTED] stated that the object was moving at a high rate of speed and appeared to change direction abruptly. [REDACTED] stated that two other people were with him at the time and that they had all observed the object.
As soon as possible after receiving this call, I made an appointment to interview [REDACTED] and the other two people who had observed the object. The interview was conducted at [REDACTED] on the evening of 25 August 1952. During the interview, [REDACTED] stated substantially the same facts as had been given to me over the telephone. [REDACTED] and the other two observers, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], corroborated [REDACTED]'s statement. All three stated that the object appeared to be round and glowing red, that it was moving at a high rate of speed, and that it made an abrupt change in direction.
During the interview, I asked the observers several questions concerning the size, altitude, speed and maneuverability of the object, but they were unable to provide any definite information on these points. They stated that the object was observed for only a short period of time and that it disappeared from view before any accurate measurements or observations could be made.

After studying the subject, it is the opinion of the Project BLUE BOOK staff that there is no evidence that the object observed was an aircraft, weather balloon, or other known object. There were no definite identifying features noted and no confirmation of the observation could be made. This report is being filed under the project name of UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

The observer's account seems to be in substantial agreement with the known cases on such subjects and the general nature of the incident would tend to corroborated the information furnished. The object was observed for a considerable length of time and was described in some detail, lending greater credence to the report.

The object was described as a silver, glare-type object of large apparent size which was observed maneuvering at high speed and altitude. It was sighted for approximately 15 minutes. No further details are available. The object could not have been an aircraft, weather balloon, or other known object according to the information furnished.

The three jet airplanes which were in the area at the time and time of sighting were reported to be unrelated to the object.

There appears to be no reasonable explanation for the incident based on the information available. The object was observed by a reliable and apparently credible witness under good conditions of visibility.

AF FORM 112—PART II
APPROVED: 1 JUNE 1952
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: MAJOR ARTHUR P. RUPLE, OPERATING OFFICER
A-12, TSUAX-BEAM, HIGHTSTOWN, N. J.    ID-31-525                        PAGE     4     OF    10     PAGES
During the course of an investigation a sightseeing party was made which lasted for over 1/2 hour. Details have been very carefully obtained from the crew of the aircraft and members of the sightseeing party who were aboard. The details tend to be precise and identical in the various descriptions, leading us to conclude that the data has been very accurately obtained.  
The described objects were clearly visible and were observed to maneuver in a manner which could not be duplicated by any known aircraft. The objects were circular in shape, appeared metallic, and gave off a bright glow, which seemed to pulsate or flicker. The objects were observed to make extremely sharp turns and stops, and appeared to have a very high rate of speed. They were observed to climb rapidly into the clouds and disappear from view. No noise was heard from the objects at any time.
The undisputed reliability of the observers and their complete lack of any known association with the subject of unidentified flying objects leads us to attach great significance to this sighting, and we respectfully submit this report for your information.
"JULY 10 1952"
This is to confirm and date in writing, as to an object sighted in the sky on 
Objects: A bright, shining, metallic-looking circular object. The object was first noticed by a member of the sightseeing party at approximately 5:35 pm. The object was observed for a period of about 30 minutes. During this time it was observed to make extremely sharp turns, stops, and rapid climbs, not possible for any known aircraft. The object appeared to be about the size of a large automobile. Its color was metallic and it gave off a bright glow which seemed to pulsate or flicker. At times the object appeared to be surrounded by a halo of light. The object was at an estimated altitude of 7,000 to 10,000 feet, and at one point appeared to be trailing what looked like smoke or vapor. At the end of the 30 minute observation period, the object suddenly climbed rapidly into the clouds and disappeared from view.
Conditions: Very clear, no winds, very slight breeze blowing from the northeast. Visibility excellent.
The reason why I called the Air Force at Park was, I was very much impressed by what I saw, and I wished to notify the proper authorities that this object had been observed, and I firmly believe that it was not any type of known aircraft, and I sincerely hope that this information will be of value in your investigations.

PAGE 5 OF 10 PAGES

The case describes a sighting with certainty in our [REDACTED] with reported height and speed of the object. It states that two military personnel observed a red, egg-shaped object on July 4, 1952, and the day of the observation was June 30, 1952.
The object was in the Henderson, Pennsylvania area. It was reported to be larger than a B-29 bomber and to fly at a high rate of speed. 
STATEMENT OF [REDACTED]
On June 30, 1952 I sighted an unidentified flying object traveling at a very high rate of speed. This object was a bright red color and egg-shaped. It appeared to be much larger than a B-29 bomber. I am reporting this incident because I feel convinced that this was no conventional aircraft.
STATEMENT OF [REDACTED]
On June 30, 1952, I also sighted the same unidentified flying object as [REDACTED]. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed and was a bright red color and egg-shaped. It appeared to be much larger than any conventional type aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PART Ill 
CONCLUSIONS / : The source of the sighting has been possible known jet aircraft in the sky but the object was described definitely as moving in an erratic random fashion. It was reported that the object changed direction and speed at various times and this accounts for the fact that it was considered very unusual.

INFORMATION OF AN UNIDENT UFLYING OBJECT

2/22% Witnesses: The object was first seen at approximately 5:30 pm on 2/21/52 by the ground observer corps personnel stationed at Keesler Air Force Base, Miss...

2/23% Witnesses: The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes and then lost to sight. It reappeared a few minutes later and was observed for another 3 or 4 minutes before being lost again. The object moved in an erratic and unconventional manner, rapidly changing direction and altitude. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and emitted no trails or exhaust...

2/24% Witnesses: The object appeared to me to be larger than any known aircraft and was traveling at a very high rate of speed.

2/25% Witnesses: This object could have been a balloon of some kind, but its maneuvers were not characteristic of a balloon.

2/26% Witnesses: I would judge the time to be from these sightings however, I would judge the time to be from three to five minutes.

2/27% Witnesses: You should make a further check on this as the object appeared to be maneuvering or at least changing in altitude and position as viewed.

The report contains no photographs, only descriptive text from various witnesses about an unidentified flying object observed near Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi on February 21-22, 1952.

There is no evidence that it did take place as it was described. The object was described as some type of flying plate, disc or elliptical aircraft that hovered and then disappeared at a rapid rate of speed. No visible means of propulsion were noted. No sound was heard. The object was only visible for a short period of time.
The pilot was unable to determine the size, speed or altitude of the object. He only saw it for a brief moment. He lost sight of it after it appeared to accelerate rapidly and disappear from view.
I The pilot is a reliable and experienced observer. He was in an excellent position to observe the object as he was flying at approximately 7,000 feet altitude at the time of the incident.
The pilot has not heard of any other similar incidents in the area and does not know of any airborne aircraft or known objects in the vicinity that could have been responsible for what he observed.

DATE: 13 JUNE 1952
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT 
REFERENCES: (A) OPERATION TATTER
(B) INCIDENT REPORT DATE 13 JUNE 1952
UNCLASSIFIED OF 39 PAGES
SUMMARY: The sight ing occurred a t approx 0100L, 13 JUNE 1952. The officer, Major - and I can't identify the name of the other witness.
THE INFORMATION: Major - and an unidentified witness were on the flight line of an airbase in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area on the morning of 13 JUNE 1952. At approximately 0100L they observed an unidentified object which appeared to be hovering over the southeast quadrant of the base. The object was described as round, about the size of a B-36. It had a bluish-white glow and seemed to be descending slowly. After 5-10 minutes of observation, the object accelerated and departed at a high rate of speed, going out of sight in 5-10 seconds. During the time of observation, the object did not appear to make any sound.
EVALUATION: This incident is being reported as an UNIDENTIFIED flying object. The observers could not determine what the object was, and there is no logical explanation apparent at this time. The detailed description of the object and its observed movements indicate that it was not likely an aircraft, balloon, meteor, or any other natural phenomenon. There is an apparent inconsistency in the time of observation (5-10 minutes) and the high speed departure (5-10 seconds). Additional information may be available which could clarify this point.
CONCLUSION: IN ACCORDANCE WITH AR 380-5, THIS DOCUMENT IS CLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED.
