AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

9570th Fly Tng Sq (10), PARC, MCCL

1. At approximately 1500, 22 June 1952, the Group Intelligence Officer and Assistant Intelligence T/Sgt Boord's Davis the Flight Engineer on B-29 36-4640,
after he reported a brief run, maintained flying object.

The intelligence officer sighted the object to be manned with a pointed oval trailing edge. The trailing edge appeared to have an opening in the center. The object was approximately 200 feet long and 40 feet thick. The color was a dark blue with a white trail or exhaust being red.

2. No conclusions can be drawn as to the aerodynamic features, other than it appeared flat. A trail of reddish sparks and streaks of light beginning, appeared
making it seem behind the object. The speed could not be determined. The object was observed and sound was heard. The source stated that he was going out the flight and estimated 200-300 ft. of the aircraft window. The source observed the object through clouds, approximately 1 mile away. It appeared to have dark wings. The time of sighting was 1520 - 21 June 1952, lasting approximately 100 feet 6000 feet. The aircraft was directly over Kelly AFB on a heading of 107 degrees.

3. T/Sgt Davis has approximately 68 hours as navigator on B-29 and six years of flying experience.

The weather was clear with tops of clouds at 6000 ft. The visibility was 20 miles. The wind was 10 to 15 knots.

4. This is an information summary of sighting.

10. Immediately after T/Sgt Davis reported the object to the aircraft commander, a turn was executed to the right through 360 degrees, but the object was not in sight. No other action was taken to check the object.

11. No other aircraft were observed in that area at the time of the sighting.

AIR FORCE LETTER NO. 200-5, 29 Apr 52

SUMMARY:

Mrs. [REDACTED], Lemoyne, Pa., reporting: observing
an unidentified object on 27 June 1952 at 2230 HOUR EAST

Mrs. [REDACTED] reported that object was a large illuminated oblong disc-
shaped object. According to the observer the object had a very smooth sur-
face and appeared to be luminous by an intense yellow light from the
inside. She described it as having a tail not perceptibly connected to the
main body. An intense yellow flame emanating from the tail appeared to be
its exhaust.

She said that it was traveling southward and then altered its course due
west, maintaining a constant altitude. No estimate of the speed could be
given other than it was traveling very fast. Faster than any jet she had ever
seen. Mrs. [REDACTED] could not estimate its altitude. The length of the ob-
servation was estimated to be three or four seconds.

Mrs. [REDACTED] claims that she has seen both comets and jet aircraft and
that this object had the appearance of neither one.

Mrs. [REDACTED] husband, Mr. [REDACTED] also observed the object.

This Office can give no definite explanation of the sighting. However,
a commercial airline, a Martin 202, was reported in the Lemoyne area at the
time by the Harrisburg Municipal Airport tower. A civilian guard claims to
have definitely seen a meteor at the same time.

Nite Duty:

The night of June 29, 1952,
at 11:35 o'clock, my husband
and I observed him a very
clear sky the object which
I shall describe.

The object was oblong
in shape and was lighted
throughout itself with
an intense yellow light.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

the outline of the object
was moth and not
invagulable in any way. The
light in the light field and
the whole thing with its
intensity heat was not fire.
It was a steady bright light.
But in the back of the object
and a little apart from the
end of the object was a
trail of red and yellow fire
which was nicely different
than the light in the body.
We thought the tail was
some form of exhaust.
We observed it for about
3 or 4 seconds and it flew
north and made a sharp
turn west and traveled

Here is the OCR text from the document:

at a turn note of
speak.
It flew straight and
curved to have a definite
course, and flew with the
shape or didn't stop as down.
It looked to be high but I
cannot estimate its altitude.
It was silent with no sound
at all.

The tail was not very
long, in fact the body of
the object was long & then
like tail.

I have seen planes, comets
and meteors. This was in
no way like any of these
three objects. It was entirely
different, and made a strange
sight there. Mas

STATEMENT

On the morning of 28 June at 0101, I drove home from the clubs, put my car in the garage and walked out to see how the weather would be in the morning for golfing.

The sky immediately above was clear. There were stars visible and there was no moon. To the north and the south there were thunder heads and occasional lightning flashes. As I was looking up, I noticed this blue light moving across the sky from southwest to northeast. My first impression was that it was a meteor. But upon closer examination, I saw that its speed was much too slow and that it had no tail. As I continued to watch the object, a blue light appeared to pulsate around the object. The object continued in a straight line at an apparent constant altitude to the northeast leaving no trail and no sound could be heard. I would estimate this altitude at between 15 and 25 thousand feet, and the speed somewhat faster than a jet. The object disappeared behind clouds to the northeast.

REPORT NO: 
ID-24-5428

PAGE 4 OF 10 PAGES

During the course of my investigation a telephone call was made to Major John T. Tate, 4708th Combat Intelligence Flight, Fifth Fighter Interceptor Wing, and he stated that he was familiar with the general area of the reported sighting, and that no unusual sightings had been reported by the crews of the aircraft. I am making to confirm the number of these cases as this squadron is on ADC to 5215 AFB, Selfridge, at present.

The description given to me by all four witnesses appear to coincide, and except for the movement by Mr. Knight of the statement that the object was globular, no cars of the description were changed.

I was unable to obtain an interview with Mrs. ________ or with the unidentified civilian woman.

Each of the four witnesses I was able to interview submitted a signed investigative statement. The statements read as follows:

"Daily 10 1952"

"While in my description and data in writing, as to an object sighted in the sky on June 20, 1952:

Object: A bright, shining, metallic-looking circular object. The only description I can give of this was that it looked like a new silver dollar so as you could see a small area of it.

Description of Disappearance: As this object started to disappear it left like a circular puff of smoke as were, swirled, and the object was positioned as though some one takes a piece of white chalk, laid it sideways, and sliced a spot on a blackboard.

Direction of Disappearance: As this object started to move away it seemed to turn from appearing on its side, to its narrow side, and it could not be seen at all. The position of the object was from the second row of seats.

Time of Sight: The first night was from the beach at Seaside Park, New Jersey, at approximately 4:05 p.m. June 20, 1952, and the second night at 4:25 p.m. same date. The second point of observation was on the bay front about one mile from the first point of observation.

Weather Conditions: Very clear, no clouds, very slight breeze blowing from the north.

The reason why I called the Air Force at Fort Dix, New Jersey was very curious, as to what I had seen, and after reading an article in the Philadelphia Bulletin and the Look Magazine, I decided that I would call and see if my observation could be of any significance.

time for someone with authority in our Force to know of my experience,
on I think it was my duty to.

I did not report this on the day I saw it, as I didn't want people thinking
I was a crackpot, and as I thought of 10 more I (could) be call the Post,
and that was on July 4, 1952, and the day of the occurrence was June 30, 1952.

The article in the Bulletin was in reference to some people who had reported
sightings in Sharpless, Pennsylvania.

I promptly the proceeding facts to be true to my knowledge, and all information
to be true as I would be with this human eye.

STATEMENT BY [REDACTED]

"On June 30, 1952, Monday, I with the naval others sighted this object at
about a 75 degree angle, out over the ocean. This object was round like a
silver dollar. I could not see any markings or windows. The height, I
believe was about 11,000'. The disappearance was complete. It just
disappeared from view in about 2 min side toward up, with puffs of smoke, and disappeared.
The time was sighted this object was about 4:05. The method the check
4:25."

STATEMENT OF [REDACTED]

"On [REDACTED] in the company of the following persons, [REDACTED]
and [REDACTED] I watched this object, and after reading both my husband's and
[REDACTED] statements, I know that they saw the same object. I am certain
that the object was completely stationary, but now it was as if it did appear both
these stationary, I truly agree with both these observations."

STATEMENT OF [REDACTED]

"On [REDACTED] in the company of the following persons, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]
and my husband, observed the appearance of this unidentified object, and after reading
with what they were. I did not see it disappear followed by the two marks rising
and one puff falling, whereas the. Certainly did not in 15 September. (The
preceding facts to the time as I saw it.)"

After reading each of these statements I interrogated each of the witnesses
and transcribed a copy of the interrogation. This copy reads as follows:

INTERROGATION OF MR. [REDACTED]

S/Sgt [Redacted]: Mr. [Redacted], this object that you saw, was it close and stationary or was it moving and hard to detect?

Mr. [Redacted]: As far as I can say it was so close that it was a very bright reflection from the sun and very easily noticed.

S/Sgt [Redacted]: Do you think this object could have been a balloon or some type of possibly one of the Navy's lighter-than-air craft commonly known as a [Redacted]?

Mr. [Redacted]: No, I do not, for I've seen quite a few of those things and also some weather balloons, and I don't think the object resembled these at all. In the first place, I was too close to have seen a weather balloon from up that high.

S/Sgt [Redacted]: Were there any projections or unusual aerodynamic features to this object other than the fact it was perfectly round?

Mr. [Redacted]: Not that I could tell. The height, the only thing that I could tell was that it was silver and with round and shiny.

S/Sgt [Redacted]: Can you give me any definite idea as to the length of time the object remained in sight each time?

Mr. [Redacted]: No, I can't. However, I would judge the time to be from three to five minutes each time.

S/Sgt [Redacted]: You remarked that the object appeared to have rather than to move around. Can you give me an opinion as to what it might have been doing?

Mr. [Redacted]: Well, it appeared to me that it might have been watching what might have been doing some kind of target practice, because one of the planes might have been doing some kind of target practice in the area. We didn't pay too much attention to the airplanes, as we were too interested.

S/Sgt [Redacted]: Did you notice any unusual markings on the aircraft, or rather any markings of identification at all?

Mr. [Redacted]: No, I didn't, for they were too high up.

S/Sgt [Redacted]: Do you have any idea as to what altitude the aircraft were operating?

Mr. [Redacted]: No.
