Box 9586
Hq 1125th FAC (ATC)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
2 February 1953

Dr. Lincoln LaPaz
Institute of Meteorites
University of New Mexico
Albuquerque, New Mexico

Dear Sir:

During our discussion on 8 January 1953, you asked me to check two sightings for you, one on 17 October 1952 in the Albuquerque area and one on 20 November 1952 in the Hutchinson, Kansas, area. I'm sorry it has taken so long to answer but I've been traveling quite a bit.

The sighting on 17 October 1952 that at first appeared to be the visual observation of an object that was simultaneously tracked by radar did not turn out to be that. On checking we found that there was no correlation between time, or direction of the reported object, and the radar pickup. It appears that the radar return was due to interference and the object visually observed was a regular meteor.

The Navy has no permanent record of any radar tracks from Hutchinson, Kansas, on 20 November 1952, at least none that I could find. It is still possible that some think was tracked but as I told you, unless it was considered to be unknown no record would be kept. Our files show no reports that could have been this meteor. I checked plus or minus four days thinking that possibly the dates reported were incorrect but could find nothing.

Yours very truly,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT
Capt, USAF

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: Report of Unidentified Flying Objects
Location: Killeen, Texas
USAF OAFF AT BASE, Killeen, Texas
Date of Observation: 17 October 1952
Date of Report: 22 October 1952

Distribution: STRATEGIC, A, MATS
Headquarters USAF, Directorate of Intelligence, ATIC, OPEN 1001

SUMMARY: (Enter below a summary of report. Give disposition in final endorsement paragraph. See instructions on reverse side of report.)

1. Due to lack of technical knowledge, and inexperience in analysis of reports of this nature, this headquarters is not qualified to properly evaluate the attached reports.

2. Personal contact with the observers, plus their profession and the condition of their letters (items 1 & 2) would certainly indicate that they are mature and competent individuals. Their statements in the report, however, are an illusion or phenomenon rather than imagination. Of apparent significance however, is the fact of a city of approximately 1500 population and many Fort Hood personnel, no additional reports were received at this station or at Fort Hood.

PAGE 2 OF 2

1. At approximately 2215 CST on 17 October 1952, Mr. and Mr. who were attending in the yard of the house which they jointly owned were watching an unusual group of light like objects moving very rapidly across the sky. Mr. immediately called to be an elongated rectangle of light, moving at jet like speed from North to South then making Southeastward. As they watched the Southeast they appeared to be turned off rather than disappear. At the same time they appeared as several objects, each holding five relative position in formations, though bobbing as in rough air. To Mr. they appeared as a rectangular rather than square formation of objects. Both gentlemen agree however, that the light did not seem to emanate from the objects but appeared as a reflected light. They did not glow nor did they leave an exhaust trail or any visible indication of the method of propulsion. No unusual movement or gyration was noted and the objects were soundless.

2. Mr. and Mr. do not agree on the period of time the streak or objects were observed. Mr. states approximately five seconds, Mr. at altitude of about one thousand (1000) feet and were observed through approximately 110 degrees of arc and about 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon. Though both deny any experience in aviation, they state the objects they saw could not have been an aircraft.

3. A check with local authorities failed to reveal corroborating observations nor did they have knowledge of spot lights or searchlights being used in the city. There were no reports of aircraft flying in the vicinity of the city at the time of observation.

Initially reported by this Hq. TT Msg. OPNS 1001

1. At approximately 2215 CST on 12 October 1952, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] of the First Methodist Church of Killeen were watching a small group of 11 light objects moving erratically across the sky. Immediately called the [redacted] attention to the phenomena. Mr. [redacted] noted what appeared to be an elongated rectangular or light, moving at first like a beam from North to South then turned off rather than disappear. As they veered to the Southeast they appeared to become objects, each disappearing through relative position in formation, though looking as in rough air. The [redacted] gentlemen agree however, that the light did not seem to emanate from the objects but appeared as reflected lights. They did not glow nor did they leave an earth trail. Both were positive in their observation.

2. Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] did not agree on the period of time the streak or other was visible. Mr. [redacted] stated apparently five seconds. Mr. [redacted] thought it was a longer period of time. Questioning revealed that they were at an altitude of about one thousand (1000) feet and were observed through approximately 110 degrees of arc at about 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon. Though both were in aviation, neither could have been an aircraft.

3. A check with local authorities failed to reveal corroborating observations nor did they have knowledge of spots of something being seen in the city. There were no reports of aircraft flying in the vicinity of the city at the time of observations.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officers:

1. Personal contact with the observers, plus their profession and the cop-
oration of their letters (incls 1 & 2) would certainly indicate that they are
making in mind, or were(generally) intelligent, and their report thereof is the
result of an illusion or phenomenon rather than imagination. Of apparent sig-
nificance is the fact that of a city of approximately 15,000 population
and nearby Fort Hood, an Army installation of approximately 20,000 personnel,
no additional reports were received at this station or at Fort Hood.

October 21, 1952

On the evening of Friday, October 17, 1952 at approximately 10:15 P.M. the Reverend Mr. [illegible] and I were standing in the back yard of the Methodist Parsonage at [illegible] in the city of Killeen, Texas. As I glanced up into the sky I caught sight of a strange group of approximately ten round, not well defined, spots or blobs of light in a single and equidistant sequence moving across the sky at an angle of approximately 60 to 70 degrees with the earth. Light seemed to reflect from rather than emanate from the objects which were moving from north to south at a very rapid rate of speed, being in sight for only about five seconds in an arc of slightly more than 100 degrees. The formation of a single straight line was maintained for the entire interim; however, as the objects moved toward the south, the formation seemed to veer toward the south-east in what would give the impression of rough air, the size of the formation as well as the separate objects which constituted it seemed to diminish, giving the effect of distance. The impression of velocity was re-emphasized by the rather sudden fading of the entire phenomenon. My first impression as evidenced by my remark to Mr. Greenwhich was that of a group of ducks in flight; however, movement was much too rapid. The absence of any sound, and the apparent lack of light of sufficient strength from the city to reflect from the objects at such a height quickly discounted this thesis. The duck thesis, however, is valuable in determining the relativity as to distance, sequence, formation, size, and proximity of the phenomenon.

A few estimations, though only relative, and in complete ignorance of air speed, height, etc. are perhaps in order. The speed of the phenomenon would [illegible text at bottom of page]
