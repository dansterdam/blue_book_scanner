FLYING SAUCER OVER NORWAY--Reports of a flying saucer over northern Norway were received in Oslo on Mar. 18. One report said the object, sighted the night before, was elliptical and its flight was accompanied by a whistling, humming sound. Another said "lit up the sky like a floodlight" as it passed over the far northern island of Froya. A Norwegian Air Force officer said there were no planes in the area at the time.
