Text in main body of document:
"The Midwest was visited on the morning of May 23rd, when observers in Kansas City saw four silver, disc-shaped objects flying in formation at extremely high speed. At one point during their flight two of the objects broke formation and veered off, but soon rejoined. It took the objects only four minutes to cross the sky."
