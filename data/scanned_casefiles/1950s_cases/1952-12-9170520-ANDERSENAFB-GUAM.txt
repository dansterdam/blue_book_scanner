AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified flying object, Guam, M.I.
DATE OF INFORMATION: 19 Dec 52
PLACE: Andersen AFB, Guam

13-a. On 19 Dec 52, at 0650, three (3) ground crew personnel of the 54th Strat. Recon. Sqdn. reported that they sighted an unidentifiable object traveling at an approximate heading of 270 degrees at an estimated speed considerably in excess of that of a conventional jet aircraft.

The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape, silvery color with a bright silvery flame trailing from the aft section. There was no exhaust or vapor trail observed. A similar or the same object was observed by two pilots of a B-17 at approximately 100 miles from Guam on a heading approximately 270 degrees during the same time span as the original sighting from the ground.

There appears to be no reason to doubt the validity of the observers' claims of sighting a flying object. Although the ground observers have not been trained in aircraft identification, the two pilots have had considerable experience and stated the object sighted did not appear to be a conventional type aircraft to their knowledge.

The text in the document is as follows:

SIGHTING OF MAJOR JAFFIN

On the morning of 19 Dec. 1952 while enroute from Kadena to Anderson AFB, Guam in an R-47G, as the pilot, I was flying in the left hand seat. Capt. McDonald, who was in the right hand seat, spotted an object which appear ed to be another aircraft in our vicinity, this object at times appeared to be another aircraft in our vicinity, at times appeared to be lighted and at other times it was not visible.

It was cylindrical in shape and I was unable to notice any distinguishing shape or marking section.  The tail colors of the object were not discernible to me; however, the body color was a luminous color and was moving horizontally in a westerly direction.

This incident occurred prior to our at 0700K, at the 10-mile boundary to Guam. I would estimate the time to be between 0645 and 0655 K. We were flying at 7000 feet and the object appeared to be at about 5000 or 6000 ft. Our ground speed was about 150 degrees at 150 degrees.

The object was easily discernible to me when first sighted but only remained in view for approximately 20-30 seconds. From the clouds and horizon, I estimated the distance between the object and our aircraft to be 20 - 25 miles.

Checking with Guam control at 0700K, I inquired if other aircraft were in the area and was informed that there were no other aircraft known to be airborne in the vicinity.

On the 19 december 1952 approximately 6:30 p.m. there was flying at 7,400 feet an unidentifiable object of 150 degrees in view a few AY Engines traveling about 20 degrees to our course and approximately the same altitade. The object appeared to be about 30 to 40 miles away. 

The object appeared to be silver white in color, with a bright blue-green trail like flame at the rear. It had a vapor like trail appearing approximately three times its own length traveling. This object was in my sight for several seconds before it passed into a cloud. At the time this object was in view we were heading 180 degrees when this object was in view to rize through 210 miles in 2.2 minutes. when I first sighted the object I called the radar operator's attention to it.

Here is the text from the document:

On 19 December 1952 about 2030 hours while carrying out a routine call, I saw a round object, approximately 3'4" in diameter, hovering some 12' to 15' above the ground. At first I thought it was a light, but as I watched, the object moved laterally some 40' to 50' behind a bush and then returned to its original position. This occurred several times. The object appeared to be metallic in color and was emitting a glow. After observing the object for about 5 minutes, I turned to look at the Sergeant who was with me, and when I looked back, the object had disappeared. I only saw the object for about 1 second, but I don't think it was a star or a planet. It was definitely something unusual that is hard to explain. I have observed many strange things in the sky, and this was one of the most puzzling. It was certainly not an aircraft or anything I'm familiar with.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

DATE: 29 December 1952
TO OBJECT: 0630. I was sitting in front of the window looking out when I noticed a bright light approach from the northeast. As it came closer it appeared to be a solid object. The object hovered over the Andersen Air Force Base for approximately 3 to 4 minutes. It then made a sharp turn to the northwest and accelerated rapidly out of sight. The object was round in shape, about the size of a car, and appeared to have a bluish-green color. There was no trail of any kind, no exhaust visible, and no noise. It was absolutely silent. The object was at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 feet. The weather at the time was clear with no clouds in the sky.

Anderson AFB, Guam
19 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
From 2050 to 2055 hours an unidentified serial object was sighted from three superimposed C-47s flying at 12,000 feet. The object appeared to be going north, 2 to 3 miles from Anderson AFB, and climbing to an altitude of 17,000 feet. It was observed as an incoming B-17 115 miles from Guam on a westerly heading. The object or objects in all cases were reported to be on a heading of 270°, appeared cylindrical in shape, of silvery color with a bright flame trailing from rear. The object was considered to be in considerable excess of the conventional jet and in each case the sighting did not exceed 15 seconds.

II. Discussion of Incident
The object was seen at 0850 a.m. at which time it would be too bright to see a meteor or satellite. The object appears to that of an observed B-52 returning directions from the unknown detection site. The time and direction of flight hold indicate that this object was five minutes alter the other sightings and yet the object was reported to have been going west of Anderson AFB. The seeming discrepancy here might be explained by the fact that the time estimate by the B-17 pilots was off. The object appears to be going towards an unknown location rather than in conjunction with other sightings but the description of the object does not coincide with usual balloon descriptions.

III. Conclusion
Unknown.

SUBJ: "Flying Saucer"; Observation of
1. At 0250 hrs., Friday, 19 December 1952, I observed an object in the sky similar to the illustration in Life magazine of April 7, 1952. This object, while similar to the illustration, was somewhat larger in appearance and traveled at a speed estimated at 75 to 100 miles per hour. It appears to have a pulsations near the forward end and near the rear. The object was first observed through binoculars and was tracked for several minutes while it was traveling in a northerly direction, apparently at a very high rate of speed. The object was seen at two different points but no accurate estimates of the distance or the rate of speed could be determined.

STATEMENT OF MAJOR McKOWN

On the evening of 19 December 1952 while enroute from Kadena to Anderson Air Force Base, Guam, an incident was reported by the undersigned, Captain McDonnell, who was in the right rear seat. Captain McDonnell pointed to the object and brought to my attention the fact that a silver-like object appeared to be another aircraft in our immediate vicinity as we were looking closer. I realized that the object could not be some of our own aircraft.

It was cylindrical in shape and I was unable to notice any distinguishing marks on the shape or distinguishing condition. The tall seemed to have the appearance of exhaust from the rear end about one-half the size of the object. This outline of the object was illuminated color and was moving horizontally to the west in a downward direction.

This incident occurred in our SHIP, a 700K, at the 100 mile boundary to Guam, and I would estimate the time to be between 0545 and 0525 LT. The object appeared to be about 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Our magnetic heading at the time was 250 degrees.

The object was at considerable distance so when first pointed out but only remained in view for approximately six (6) seconds. From the closure and horizon references I estimate the distance between the object and our aircraft to be 20 - 30 miles.

Operation with own contact at 7000K as I inquired if other aircraft were in the area and was informed that none were known to be, although is reason aircraft had departed Anderson.

Text found in the document:

On 19 December 1952 at about 0650 hours, I was sitting in front of Ross Dock #3 on the 54th Strategic Reconnaissance Ramp Army Air Field, Andersen AFB, Guam. I was looking at the northern sky, when I noticed an object travelling at a tremendous rate of speed, leaving a trail behind it. At first I thought I might see it. When I looked in the southeasterly direction of the sky, suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw an object come from behind a bank of clouds. It was so bright I called to the other fellow, "Look at the shining star!" As I continued to watch the object, it was circling and climbing rapidly when the bright light went out. After a few seconds it reappeared and the light pulsed in another opening between clouds. It was traveling in such a irregular motion, that I could not see that there were any distinct portions to it, a bright, shiny surface, and it seemed to me to be a trailing star. After the light went out, the object still continued, and I was able to see a silver, silvery blue trail behind the object other than the bright silvery blue flame which seemed to disappear. The object did not flame was long and slender and traveling about twice as fast as any jet plane I've ever seen. When it last saw it, it disappeared behind a cloud bank just north of where I was watching. It seems to have traveled a tremendous distance before disappearing altogether. It didn't show up again.

22 December 1952

STATEMENT

On 22 December 1952 about 0650 hours while awaiting take off call on the 2143 radar scope, Airman Harry A. W. Tobias (Dome Door #2), 1522d Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron, reported seeing an object over the runway (approximately) 1/30 Johnson, Lt. was discussing the UFO called by attention as a "falling star".

When he said "It's gone behind that cloud bank", the object was painting in a southeasterly direction.  

There was an open space in the clouds and Airman Johnson, and Adams, and I157203219, could see the object again. It appeared to be travelling in a very straight line very fast - it was about 270 degrees from compass directions (checked later). The object was travelling about twice as fast as a jet plane. It had a bright silverness trailing from the rear end. There was no trail or vapor trail behind it - I could not hear any noise and there had been no sound that it would have carried the sound away. 

I only saw the object for about 4 seconds, but I don't think it was a meteorite for the following reasons: First, it travelled in too straight a line - meteorites usually have erratic paths; and second, I have observed falling stars before, and have never seen one travel as fast and with such a bright silvery appearance as this object. To me, it appeared to be a man-made object, but I could not identify it.

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN MAO DONALD

On the 19 December 1952 approximately 0530, we were flying at 7500 feet on a heading of 150 degrees when I saw a bright object traveling about 20 degrees to each side of the nose of the aircraft. The object was silver-white in color, with a bright blue ball like flame at the aft end. It appeared to be traveling faster than the aircraft.

The object appeared to be silver-white in color, with a bright blue ball like flame at the aft end. It appeared to be traveling faster than the aircraft.

This object was in view we were about 130 miles NNW of Guam. When I first sighted the object I called major Dickerson's attention to it.
