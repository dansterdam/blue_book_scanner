Wing Intelligence Officer

NON APPLICABLE

13.a. On 19 Dec 52, at 0650K, three (3) ground crew personnel of the 54th Strat. Recon. Sqdn. reported that they sighted an unidentifiable object traveling an approximate heading of 270 degrees from Anderson AFB, at a speed estimated to be considerably in excess of that of a conventional jet aircraft.

b. The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape, silvery color with a bright silvery flame trailing from the aft section. There was no exhaust or vapor trail observed. A similar or the same object was observed by two pilots of a B-17 at approximately 130 miles from Guam on a heading approximately 270 degrees during the same time span as the original sighting from the ground.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

There appears to be no reason to doubt the validity of the observers claims of sighting a flying object. Although the ground observers have not been trained in aircraft identification the two pilots have had considerable experience and stated the object sighted did not appear to be a conventional type aircraft to their knowledge.

STATEMENT OF MAJOR KNOWN

On the morning of 19 Dec. 1952 while enroute from Kadena to Andersen in B-17, #3664, an object was sighted by the undersigned. At the time of sighting, I was flying as pilot in the 1st hams seat. Capt. Machowsky who was in the right seat pointed to the object and brought my attention to it. This object at first glance appeared to be another aircraft in our immediate vicinity but on looking closer, I realized that it was not a conventional type of aircraft.

It was cylindrical in shape and I was unable to notice any distinguishing shape of the nose or leading sections. The tail seemed to have the appearance of exhaust gases extending to the rear about one-half the distance of the object. The solid part of the object was aluminum color and was moving horizontally in a westerly direction.

This incident occurred prior to our ETA, 0700K, at the 100mile boundary to Guam, and I would estimate the time to be between 0645 and 0655 K. We were flying at 7000 feet and the object appeared to be about 9000 or 10000 feet. Our magnetic heading at the time was 150 degrees.

The object was easily discernible to me when first pointed out but only remained in view for approximately six (6) seconds. From the clouds and horizon I estimated the distance between the object and our aircraft to be 20 - 30 miles.

Checking with Guam control at 0700K, I inquired if other aircraft were in the area and was informed that none were known to be although a Rescue aircraft had departed Andersen at 0648K.

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN JOE DONALD

On the 19 December 1952 approximately 6:30, to were flying at 7,000 feet on a heading of 150 degrees when I saw an object traveling about 30 degrees to our course, and approximately the same altitude.

The object appeared to be about 30 to 50 miles away.

The object appeared to be silver white in color, with a bright blue ball like flame at the aft ends, it had a vapor like trail approximately three times its own length. This object was in my sight for about 15 seconds before it passed into a cloud. At the time this object was in view we were about 1.5 miles N.W. of Guam. When I first sighted the object I called Major Harold's attention to it.

CONFIDENTIAL

On 19 December 1952 about 0650 hours while awaiting roll call in the 5146 Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (map area (some book 72), I was walking a (?) line near camp take-off to the runway. John Johnson, who was about over one of the runways (approximately), W/O Johnson, etc. who was sitting at a left, caused by attention to what he expressed as a "falling star".

Then I turned to look, as said "it's some kind that cloud behind something in a southwesterly direction".

There was an open space in the clouds and Johnson and Adams and other kept watching. Suddenly, about 2 or 3 miles away, suddenly a silvery, metallic object which appeared to me to be cylindrical, almost round, began leaving the clouds. It was traveling in a very straight northwesterly path, passing about 1750 degrees (true bearing) and seemed to be traveling about twice as fast as a jet plane. It had a bright silvery flame traveling from nose ends. There was no noise until or vapor trail behind it. I could not hear any noise and it was slowly moving. I would have carried the sound away.

I only saw the object for about 1 second, but I don't think it was a meteorite for two reasons. First, it traveled on two straight a low - I have observed falling stars and they always had some curve to their path. Second, it was too silvery appearing. Definitely I looked so me as though there was a bright silvery flame attached directly to it. The flame seemed to be slightly larger than the object.

STATEMENT

On 29 December 1952 at about 0859, I was sitting in front of nose tents 2 on the 50th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron map room at Anderson AFB, Guam. The map was showing the current cloud and weather conditions and I had been reporting swimming to base and I was just looking all around the skies watching. I might have hit. Near I looked in the southwestern part of the sky. Suddenly into view came a large silvery blue object, falling there. It continued on two east and west behind a large cloud. It was traveling in such a straight line that I no lower thought it was a falling star. I could see and was sure two objects pertains to it a bright, shiny silvery fruit end and a bright silvery blue plane coming out of the west end of a forward portion. There was no noise and no odor or vapor trail. While the object was longer than the bright silvery blue plane which seemed to be slightly longer than the object itself. The object and plane was long, and slender and traveled about twice as just as my job. I've ever seen. Then I last saw it, it disappeared. While I could make out details, I could see another opening in the clouds, but it never reappeared. It didn't turn or take any maneuvers while we saw it.

Anderson AFB, Guam                                                19 December 1952

I.    Description of Incident

From 2050 to 2055 hours an unidentified aerial object was sighted from three separate points of observation -- (1) ground crew personnel at Anderson AFB, Guam, (2) Naval Officer 10 miles south of Anderson AFB, and (3) from an incoming B-17 115 miles from Guam on a westerly heading. The object or objects in all cases were reported to be on a heading of 270°, appeared cylindrical in shape, of silvery color with a bright plane trailing from the rear. The speed was considered to be in considerable excess of that of a conventional jet and in each case the sighting did not exceed 45 seconds.

II.   Discussion of Incident

The object was seen at 0850 a.m. at which time it would be too bright to see a meteor or star. It appears that all observers saw the same object since descriptions, directions given to the unknown, and time of sighting all coincide. The B-17 pilots sighted the object 115 miles west of Guam, five minutes after the other sightings and yet the object was reported to have been going west of Anderson AFB five minutes earlier. This seeming discrepancy here might be explained by the fact that the time estimate by the B-17 pilots was not 100% accurate. The object appears to be going too slow to be a meteor and all local aircraft have been accounted for. There was a scheduled balloon launch at Guam at 2100Z close to the sighting time but the description of the object does not coincide with usual balloon descriptions.

MEMORANDUM

From: 64
To: 30
Subj: "Flying Saucer"; observation of

1. At 0650 hrs, Friday, 19 December 1952, I observed an object in the sky similar to that illustrated in Life Magazine of April 7, 1952. This object, while similar to the illustration, was somewhat more narrow and longer. It was intensely brilliant and of the green color. It appeared to have a nucleus near the forward end and was surrounded by a haze of light which streamed out behind, giving the whole object a torpedo shape. It passed south of O'Omar Hill was traveling in a westerly direction, apparently at a very high rate of speed. The object was seen between clouds at two different points but no accurate estimates of the distance or the rate of speed could be determined.

2. This is for your information and use as may be appropriate.

STATEMENT OF MAJOR McKOWN

On the morning of 19 December 1952 while enroute from Kadena to Andersen in B-17, # 3661, an object was sighted by the undersigned. At the time of sighting, I was flying as pilot in the left hand seat. Captain MacDonald who was in the right seat pointed to the object and brought my attention to it. This object at first appeared to be another aircraft in our immediate vicinity by a looking closer, I realized that it was not a conventional type of aircraft.

It was cylindrical in shape and I was unable to notice any distinguishing shape of the nose or leading section. The tail seemed to have the appearance of exhaust gases extending to the rear about one-half the distance of the object. The solid part of the object was aluminum color and was moving horizontally in a westerly direction.

This incident occurred prior to our ETA, 0700K, at the 100 mile boundary to Guam, and I would estimate the time to be between 0645 am 0655 K. We were flying at 7000 feet and the object appeared to be about 9000 and 10,000 feet. Our magnetic heading at the time was 150 degrees.

The object was easily discernible to me when first pointed out but only remained in view for approximately site (6) seconds. From the clouds and horizon I estimated the distance between the object and our aircraft to be 20 - 30 miles.

Checking with Guam control at 0700K, I inquired if other aircraft were in the area and was informed that none were known to be although a Rescue aircraft had departed Andersen at 0648K.

STATEMENT

On 19 December 1952 at about 0650 hours, I was sitting in front of Nose Dock #2 on the 54th Strategic Reconnaissance Ramp Area at Andersen AFB, Guam, M. I., awaiting roll call. One of our aircraft had been reported returning to the base and I was just looking all around the skies thinking I might see it. When I looked in the Southeasterly part of the sky, suddenly, this object flashed out from behind a bank of clouds. It was an object I called a "falling star". It continued on from the East and went behind a large cloud. Then the other fellows turned to look, it was gone, momentarily, and then reappeared in another opening cloud. I was traveling in such a straight flat line that I no longer thought it was a "falling star". I could now see that there were two distinct portions to it; a bright, shiny metallic front end and a bright, silvery blue plane coming out of the rear end of the forward portion. There was no noise and no smoke or vapor trail behind the object other than the bright silvery blue flame which seemed to be slightly longer than the object itself. The object was long and slender and travelling about twice as fast as any jet plane I've ever seen. When I last saw it, it disappeared behind a cloud bank just south of us. "We kept watching further along where there was another opening in the clouds, but it never reappeared. It didn't turn or make any maneuvers while we saw it.

STATEMENT

On 19 December 1952 about 0650 hours while awaiting well call in the 54th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron Ready Area (Nose Dock #2), I was watching a 794th ARS B-29 take-off to the NE. When aircraft was just about over the runway (approximately), 1/50 Johnson, M. T., who was sitting at my left, called my attention to what he expressed as a "falling star".

When I turned to look, he said "It's gone behind that cloud bank", pointing in a southeasterly direction.

There was an open space in the clouds and Airman Johnson, and Adams, and myself kept watching this opening for about 1 or 2 seconds. Suddenly a silvery, metallic object which appeared to be a cylindrical flashpan quite away behind the clouds. It was traveling in a very straight horizontal path heading about 270 degrees (from compass direction checked later). The object was traveling about twice as fast as a jet plane. It had a bright silvery flame trailing from its rear end. There was no smoke trail or vapor trail behind it. I could not hear any noise and 1° there was any, the wind was from the NE, not strong, but it would have carried the sound away.

I only saw the object for about 1 second, but I don't think it was a meteor. First, it traveled too straight a line - I have observed falling stars before, and they have always had some curve to their path. Second, it was too silvery metallic appearing. It definitely looked to me as though there was a bright silvery flame attached directly to it. The flame seemed to be slightly longer than the object.

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN MAC DONALD

On the 19 December 1952 approximately 0630, we were flying at 7300 feet on a heading of 150 degrees when I saw an object traveling about 90 degrees to our course, and approximately the same altitude. The object appeared to be about 20 to 30 miles away.

The object appeared to be silver white in color, with a bright blue like line at the aft end, it had a vapor like trail; approximately three times the own length trailing. This object was in my sight for about 45 seconds before it passed into a cloud. At the time this object was in view we were about 130 miles NNW of Guam. When I first sighted the object I called Major McKewan's attention to it.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

2. Unidentified flying object.
3. At 0635 on 19 Dec 1952 an unidentified flying object was reported being sighted from Andersen AFB, Guam.
4. At the same time, 0635, a similar or the same object was sighted by a Navy Commander.
5. At 0635 the same or similar object was sighted by two pilots as a position 115 miles from Andersen AFB, Guam.

The object appeared to be silvery in color with a bright silvery blue flame trailing behind. The estimated length of the object to three times its length. The speed of the object appeared to be continuous at 700 feet per minute or 7 miles per hour. The object was not reported being audible. The object in all aspects disappeared after an interval of observation.

The Naval Commander stated the object appeared very similar to that illustrated in Life magazine of April 7, 1952. All sightings were from approximately 0635 to 0645 and no sighting was for more than 45 seconds duration. All sightings, both ground and air, were visual. The three ground observers were two Air Force officers and one civilian.

Three of the ground observers were at Andersen AFB (13 degrees 35'N - 144 degrees 56'E). The coordinates of the object were at an altitude of distance or altitude but stated the object was traveling on a heading of approximately 270 degrees. The Naval Commander was located at approximately 13 degrees 27'N - 144 degrees 43'N 15'E. No estimate was made of the altitude or distance but stated the object was horizontal, and available on the reliability of the Naval Officer's sighting. The three airmen were comparatively unanimous in stating that the object was horizontal, and did not have the appearance of any meteor ever observed by them.

The two pilots have had considerable flying experience and it is felt that their judgment is sound. One of the pilots is a weather officer and stated the object did not appear to be a meteorological phenomenon. The ceiling was as follows: at Andersen AFB during the time of sighting was as follows: ceiling 1000 feet overcast, estimated 9000 feet broken, visibility 8 miles, wind 020/18, altimeter setting 29.85.

There was no activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sightings. There was no physical evidence or photographs of the sightings. There was no interception or identification action taken on the sightings. At the time of sighting the only known traffic within the area was a Rescue SB-29 which had taken off from Andersen AFB at 0640.
