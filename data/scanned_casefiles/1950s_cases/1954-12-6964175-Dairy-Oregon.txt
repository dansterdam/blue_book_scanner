10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
ROUND, SILVER COLORED, 10 FT. IN DIAMETER. RAPID TAKE OF SPEED, SOUND SIMILAR TO "WHEE", STOPPED ONCE, OBSERVED WITH 10 POWER GLASSES, RIFLE SCOPE AND SURVEYOR TRANSIT.

11. COMMENTS
IN THE LIGHT OF CONFLICTING INFORMATION (DESCRIPTION GIVEN DOES NOT DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A PRONOUNCED DIVERSION) IT IS FELT THAT THE REPORTED OBJECT WAS CLEARING WHEN FIRST OBSERVED ON AN APPROX HEADING OF 120 THEN EXECUTED A 90 DEG CLEARING TURN TO THE LEFT ON AN APPROX HEADING OF 20 GIVING THE ILLUSION OF STANDING STILL WITH THE SUN AND DIVERSION EXPANDING THIS ILLUSION, SHORTLY AFTER PERFORMING THE CLEARING TURN ON A 20 HEADING THE ACFT LEVELED OUT ON A (CONT)
