that bring the "travel" or "motion" of the saucer into direct degree bias of "motion." I believe there is a "flow" in its' body when transversing from a tangitial to a vertical magnetic field. Being as we know it electrodes – magnetic. is 8 x 10, therefore why can't there be an "electro" del.magmetic field in front, both and side of the saucer at all times, thus creating a line a lines of she-magnetic concentrating," as such diagonal before.

(P.T.A.) Would send as say, 15% of electro-magnetic concentrating"

(P.T.B.) Would send as say, 10% of electro-magnetic "concentrating"

(P.T.C.) Would send as say, 50% of "concentrating" 

also the side-way motion, or travel inside is from front-to-rear, outward, in a spherical form, either as a rod or shaft of form is elongated, or shortened.

Of course concerning the shape of the object it would be of a circular nature, such as the saucer pattern making, of this universe and spiral degrees of this universe "Hole" in the center of saucer.

The document contains three simple drawings that are part of the data entry related to a UFO sighting report. Each drawing appears to represent different aspects of the UFO sighting:

1. The first drawing depicts a triangle with a dotted line expanding from one apex. 
2. The second drawing is also of a triangle with an arc above it, possibly indicating movement or a trajectory.
3. The third drawing is a half-circle or dome shape with a straight line cutting through horizontally at the middle and a small segment marked "45".

37) Was this the first time that you saw
an object, an object like this? (Answer Yes)

38) In your opinion what do you think this
object was? And what might have caused it?
(Answer: I believe the object was a U.F.O.
Why? Because it was travelle
far an air-plane, it like most curious
his a very clear sky. It was about

was irregular course at any time. Had a

39) Do you think you could estimate the speed
of the object?
(Answer:) At the time I saw the object I could
approximately lasted for 17 seconds, I estimate
its velocity at the night after sunset, 10 minutes
after, that circulating the two objects till day
later, that velocity at some hundreds miles per
hour. Though it was not as high as the [illegible]
the time element is the differential [illegible])
