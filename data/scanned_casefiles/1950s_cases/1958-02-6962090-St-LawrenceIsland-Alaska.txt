PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE
28 Dec 53

2. LOCATION
St. Lawrence Island, Alaska

3. DATE-TIME GROUP
Local: 28/1217
GMT: 28/1217

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

5. PHOTOS
No

6. SOURCE
USAF Airman

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
20 mins

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
Stationary 235 deg

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
W.W. group observer saw a bright light, size of half dollar, close to the horizon. Observed for almost half-hour. Rpd apparently because termination of line of sight was in USSR territory.

12. CONCLUSIONS
(Checkboxes are unchecked)

11. COMMENTS
Pilots of the area, plus requests for further data indicate that the light observed was, without doubt, on the observers island. The very low elev (2 deg in the horizon), with the known high elevations tend to support this.

OFFICER. OBSERVER IS RELIABLE AND QUALIFIED OBSERVER OF WEATHER
PHENOMENA. ANGLE OF AZIMUTH IS PROBABLE GOOD PLUS OR MINUS 15
DEGREES. A MORE ACCURATE AZIMUTH WILL BE DETERMINED BY USE OF TRANSIT
IN RELATION TO MOUNTAIN AND OBJECT, WHICH WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER,
UPON SUITABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THIS STATION. TIME OF INSTANT
RAISE IN PRESSURE IN FIRST CASE REPORTED IN A ABOVE COINCIDES WITH
TIME DURING OBSERVER SIGHTING OBJECT. OBSERVER STATES THE USE OF THE
CIRCULARS INDICATED TO HIM OF A GREAT DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT SINCE
AN INDICATION DOES NOT HELP MUCH OVER THE NAKED EYE. HYPOTHESIS:
LIGHT CREATED FROM A SOURCE SUCH AS AN EXPLOSION A CONSIDERABLE
DISTANCE AWAY WEST OF THIS STATION CAUSING A RISE IN PRESSURE AT
THIS STATION. BAROGRAPH CHART FOR 28 FEB 58 FOR THIS STATION HAS
BEEN SENT TO 7 WEATHER GROUP, ELMENDORF, ALASKA IN REGISTERED MAIL

(119) ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND

ELEVATIONS IN FEET

USSR
Gulf of Anadyrsky

ISLAND

Point of Observation
Approx 285-7

The document appears to be a map of St. Lawrence Island, showing geographical details, elevations, and the boundary between the USSR and the United States.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

SCALE 1:1,000,000

ANADYRSKIY GULF (75)

N 6400-W17100/160x140

At the bottom of the map, there are grid references and coordinate labels such as GE, HE, JE, JF, KE, KF, and AL.

The map appears to be of the Anadyrskiy Gulf region, showing geographical features, latitude and longitude lines, and various grid sections. The scale is 1:1,000,000.

TENTATIVE ANALYSIS - St. Lawrence Island
UFO Sighting 28 Feb 58

Basic, Essential Data:

1. Semi-circular in shape; first jagged on top - latter smoothing off

2. Size: about half dollar. However, note: AS OBSERVED THRU 7 X 50
BINOCULARS! (Object was therefore 1/7 this size to naked eye)

3. Stationary. No movement reported.

4. Almost one half hour in sight.

5. Direction (azimuth) from Ob. Pt. - approximately 285째 (Rept. states could be plus or minus 15째)

Missing Essential Data:

1. Azimuth given - but no elevations. A line of sight plotted (Aero Chart #119, St. Lawrence, Island) from Northeast Cape (observer's point) splits the island almost length wise - and appears to terminate on USSR soil in the vicinity of the Gulf of Anadyrsky.

2. If the elevation is low - possible that it could have been some light or object on the island itself, as there are a few high points (although the conditions would not necessarily applicable)

3. If an elevation was high - it could indicate unknown activities or operations taking place in the Gulf of Anadyrsky area.

Significant Points:

1. The bright star Capella was in the exact line of sight given by the observer approximately 40째- 45째 elevation (which was not given).

2. With binoculars (and the known characteristics of planets and stars observed at high latitudes) this star would appear unusual, particularly if observed through slight haze or fog. Note, that the object remained stationary for almost one half hour!

3. Although stationary for an exceptionally (for UFOs) long period. Neither of the two radar stations could pick it up.

4. Any explosion (leaving smoke, mushroom debris, etc.) would normally not remain suspended with the same shape, for such a period of time.

CONCLUSIONS:

On the basis of the limited data given, and pending receipt of further data, it is the opinion that the object observed probably was an astronomical body.

JOINT MESSAGEFORM - CONTINUATION SHEET

FROM: COMDR ATIC

WESTERN SHORES. IF HIGH ANGLE, POSSIBILITY OF UNKNOWN SOVIET ACTIVITIES OR OPERATIONS MAY BE CONSIDERED.

1. HOUR HYPOTHESIS: HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ANY SMOKE, MUSHROOM CLOUD, ETC. RESULTING FROM AN EXPLOSION WOULD REMAIN IN SAME POSITION, WITHOUT CHANGE IN SHAPE FOR ALMOST ONE HALF HOUR.

2. SIGNIFICANT TO POINT OUT THAT BRIGHT STAR CAPELLA IN ALMOST EXACT AZIMUTH GIVEN BY OBSERVER, AT ABOUT 40 TO 50 DEGREES ELEVATION. UNUSUAL APPEARANCE OF CELESTIAL BODIES OBSERVED IN ARCTIC REGIONS, AND ESPECIALLY IF OBSERVED THROUGH BINOCULARS IN DARK WELL KNOWN TO UFO ANALYSTS, PARTICULARLY IF ANY HAZE, FOG, ETC. EXISTS BETWEEN OBSERVER AND OBJECT.

3. REQUEST ACTION BE TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 4B AND 6B, AFR 200-2, AND THE RESULTS MADE KNOWN TO THIS CENTER.
