The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document. The page appears to be text-based, containing handwritten notes and details about a reported UFO sighting.

Transcribed text from the document:

THE OBSERVERS WERE LOOKING AT A CLOUD WHICH WAS COVERED BY CLOUDS.

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE OF INTELLIGIBILITY, SINCE AT REPORT WAS NOT MADE UNTIL 7 DAYS LATER.

IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THERE WERE ANY SPECIAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS IN THE AREA AT TIME.

THE OBSERVERS WERE MEN OF GOOD REPUTE AND A RE CONVINCES THAT THEY SAW SOMETHING UNUSUAL.
