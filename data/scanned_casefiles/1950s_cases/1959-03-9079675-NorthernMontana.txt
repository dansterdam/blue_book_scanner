I. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: The crew of the F-89J, call sign "BOARDPIPS 27".

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: The pilot and radar observer appeared to be well qualified and their report was considered to be highly reliable. The carbon copy crew maintains very few records during flight and for this reason the times and other details may not be as accurate as possible. The observers did not make hasty estimates where a possibility of error existed.

III. INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED: The following named crew members of "BOARDPIPS 27" were interviewed at MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE, MONTANA on 24 March 1959:

NAME - RANK - AFSC - RATING - HOURS EXPERIENCE
BOND, AUSTIN H. - 1LT - 4020-80-94 - Pilot - 233 - 21 Months
MCANALLY, CHARLES C. JR. - 1LT - 4030-07-73 - Radar Observer - 187 - 11 Months

IV. The following named Duty GCI Controller ("CANADIAN CLUB") was interviewed at MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE, MONTANA on 11 March 1959:

NAME - RANK - AFSC - RATING - HOURS EXPERIENCE
MURPHY, RONALD S. - 1LT - 272-72-38 - GCI Director - 472 - 21 Months

3. "BOARDPIPS 27" was participating in an operational AIRSCRAMBLE in an effort to identify an object appearing to be trailing a B-52 into the NORTHERN ADC DIRECTION CONTROL ZONE on 25 March 1959 at 0104Z.

03245 "CANADIAN CLUB" received a call from F-89, call sign "CUTCOME 15", minutes without any identification. "CUTCOME 15" was advised to call "BOARDPIPS 27" who was behind him for the past fifteen (15) minutes.

03054 "CUTCOME 15" informed "CANADIAN CLUB" that the object had followed him there on 34,000 ft with an estimated airspeed of 280 knots.

03052 "CANADIAN CLUB" was unable to locate the object on radar. A "SCRAMBLE" of "BOARDPIPS 27" to 25,000 ft which a heading of 260 degrees was ordered.

03104 "BOARDPIPS 27" airborne.

03112 "CANADIAN CLUB" called "CUTCOME 15 (ARSON-10935)" in regards to aircraft in his area. "CUTCOME 15" stated he had temporarily lost the object and requested assistance from "BOARDPIPS 27".

03132 Radar observer on "BOARDPIPS 27" during climb out, picked up an aircraft heading at MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE, MONTANA on his scope.

SCARDPIPE 27" reported at 20,000 FT, heading 360 degrees, at a speed of 400-500 mph.

03192 Radar observer on "SCARDPIPE 27" made ground radar contact
with "SCARDPIPE 27" and a closing rate of 1,500 mph was estimated. At times, the object was to rear of -5-22 the radar observer, changed to normal closing rate.

03314 "SCARDPIPE 15" reported to "CANADIAN CLUB" that "SCARDPIPE 27" was at -sixty (60) degrees.

03244 "SCARDPIPE 15" reported to "CANADIAN CLUB" that "SCARDPIPE 27" and the object were moving on the course of 270 degrees.

03353 "CANADIAN CLUB" relayed to "SCARDPIPE 27" that he and the object were marking on the course of MULLING 27".

03332 Pilot of "SCARDPIPE 27" reported visual contact with the object ending the following:
a. Object was forty (40) degrees right at approximately twenty (20) miles.
b. Jet and object, both blinking running lights, 15 to 20 lights were estimated to be thirty (30) to forty (40) feet apart.
c. A steady white light estimated to be from 15 to 20 feet in height was seen between the jet and green blinking lights. This light appeared to be slightly to the rear and ground and seemed to be illuminating the jet.
d. Pilot of "SCARDPIPE 27" observed what appeared to be a row of "SCARDPIPE 27" that the "object" was definitely above while flying.

03222 "CANADIAN CLUB" also reported negative radar contact. It was determined that the lights displayed on "SCARDPIPE 27" at an altitude of 30,500 FT, had blinking lights displayed and was estimated to be approximately thirty (30) miles on a heading of 100 degrees.

03222 The pilot of "SCARDPIPE 27" estimated he had closed to four (4) miles of the object. It is assumed the object observed "SCARDPIPE 27" as the distance between the two was closing rapidly and both were at an approximate 30,000 FT altitude and were seen to climb.

03294 Radar observer of "SCARDPIPE 27" observed a white/pink glow, believed to be from the position of the object. As the pilot maneuvered, no sighting of the blinking lights was made.

03302 The pilot of "SCARDPIPE 27" reported maneuvering at 550 degrees, obtaining a visual contact to a radar indicated object at a range of approximately thirty (30) miles on a heading of 320 degrees.

03321 Lack of "SCARDPIPE 27" coordination, at a speed of approximately 200 knots (230 mph) with the object steadily, pulling 4-5 G's at a speed of 0.8 mach) with the object steadily.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN CLUB advised "GADRDIFE" 27" to break off pursuit as the object was "disappearing" from sight. POSITION: Over Northern Montana
GADRDIFE "27" OVERHEARD THE FOLLOWING GARBLED MESSAGES FROM CALGARY RADIO:
"GONO-LILLUP" (...CONTROLLER ON DUTY DER FIELD STATION- SAYS TO-) "GADRDIFE 27- CONTINUE RUN TO CALGARY-LILLUP"

"GADRDIFE 27 BREAK OFF PURSUIT. RETURN TO FIELD." "GADRDIFE 27 LANDED AT LEWISTOWN AIR FORCE BASE, MONTANA WITHOUT MAKING CONTACT"
COMMENTS OF INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: The SCR-12 Fire Control System went inoperative unexpectedly during the pursuit of the unidentified target by "CANADIAN CLUB" to check the SCR-522 radar on the return flight. The radar controllers at the Great Falls Air Force Base failed to maintain coordination or control of this engagement, and cleared air traffic through the area at the 8,000 Airspace Control and Warning System. CANADIAN CLUB was continuing the pursuit at low altitude until ordered to break off under mysterious circumstances. NEGATIVE AIR CONTACT was made, and the ultimate fate of the target still remains unknown. THE DUTY SCR DIREC TOR OF THE CANADIAN CLUB RELATED THESE COMMENTS CONFIDENTIALLY.

OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
Observed by: Capt. John J. Smith, Capt. R.T. Reynolds.
Location: 30 miles north of Great Falls, Montana. 
Time: 20:20 MST, 3/9/59.
Weather: clear sky, light breeze, temp. approx 10° F.

The object was first observed in the northwest at an angle of approximately 45° above the horizon. It was traveling in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 500 - 600 mph. The object was described as being cone-shaped, with a definite front and rear end. It glowed with a reddish-orange color and left no trail. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute before it disappeared from sight.

Capt. Smith and Capt. Reynolds were flying an RB-36 at 30,000 ft. when they first observed the object. They immediately reported the sighting to the radar controller at Great Falls AFB. The radar controller stated that he had the object painted on his scope but could not identify it. 

The above information is submitted for your evaluation and filing.

Directorate of Intelligence states that the UFO could have been an artificial satellite. This is the best explanation that could be offered. No further information could have been obtained which could have added to the return which was returned which placed us by the surveillance command.

C. "The development of radar absorbent materials has been solved for a number of years with only limited success. As of 1957, a honeycomb material caused the radar cross-sections to be camouflaged. However, the structure was so complex it was not suitable for production, and is still not being used."

"Since the UFO demonstrated a high performance and was painted by a high frequency radar, some doubt is cast on the credibility of the radar observation."

References is made to the additional data included in the Air Defense Command letter of 19 March 1959. A review of this additional material indicates that there is not sufficient factual data to justify modifying the existing evaluation of this case. The original determination that the material are more likely of natural origin still prevails. However, there is not sufficient conclusive information from the data contained in the report to definitely establish the identity of the objects observed.

The object was traveling at 35 knots and changed positions at irregular intervals. It disappeared from view and reappeared in another position. The object was at all times in a rather erratic flight path, and erratic in its motions. It gave no clue to the manner of its locomotion. After the object had been monitored for some time, it descended and its speed increased to approximately 375 knots and it suddenly disappeared from view in a straight line flight, and then the object disappeared.
