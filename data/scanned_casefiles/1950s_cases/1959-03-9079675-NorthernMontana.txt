Unidentified Flying Object

SUMMARY: This report contains information about an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) observation on 26 Mar 59 at Malmstrom AFB, Montana by a F-89J pilot and radar observer during a "SCRAMBLE" from Malmstrom Air Force Base. A visual observation was made by the pilot for a period of approximately ten (10) minutes and also by the radar observers, although intermittently, for approximately the same length of time.

Observations were made from an estimated range of four (4) to thirty (30) miles. A B-52 aircraft with ground navigation range was utilized on ground navigation range with identification of a B-52 aircraft and a tanker type aircraft. The radar was switched from normal (range of thirty (30) miles) to ground (range of 200 miles) resulting in negative contact with the object.

After the visual sighting was made by the F-89J crew, it was assumed that the object observed the F-89J because at this time the object made an eighty (80) degree right turn and climbed, at speeds greater than the capability of the F-89J, and disappeared into the horizon.

Originating Agency: Dat. 5, 1006th AISS
Geiger Field, Spokane, Wash.

REPORT NO. D5-2-59    PAGE 3    OF 4    PAGES

03152 "BOARDPIPE 27" reported at 30,000 ft, heading 360 degrees, at a speed of 
        578 mach. "CANADIAN CLUB" advised "BOARDPIPE 27" to change heading to 
        360 degrees for a sixty (60) degree beam attack.

03192 Radar observer on "BOARDPIPE 27" using ground range, made radar contact 
        with "OUTCOMS 15" and a refueling tanker at approximately fifty-five (55) 
        miles. As the object was to rear of B-52, the radar observer changed to 
        normal range radar in an attempt to locate the object.

03212 "OUTCOMS 15" reported to "CANADIAN CLUB" that "BOARDPIPE 27" was at sixty 
        (60) degrees astern of tail.

03242 "OUTCOMS 15" reported to "CANADIAN CLUB" that "BOARDPIPE 27" and the 
        object were merging on the radar scope at a range of 9,000 yards.

03252 "CANADIAN CLUB" relayed to "BOARDPIPE 27" that he and the object were 
        merging on the scope of "OUTCOMS 15".

03262 Pilot of "BOARDPIPE 27" reported visual contact with the object noting 
        the following:

        a. Object was forty (40) degrees right at approximately twenty (20) miles.

        b. Red and green blinking running lights. These lights were estimated 
           to be thirty (30) to forty (40) feet apart.

        c. A steady white light assumed to be the tail light was seen between 
           the red and green running lights. This light appeared to be slightly 
           to the rear of the red and green running lights.

        d. Arrangement of the observed lights indicated to the pilot of "BOARDPIPE 
           FIVE 27" that the object was delta or swept wing type.

03262 "CANADIAN CLUB" gave "BOARDPIPE 27" permission to make his identification 
        run. "CANADIAN CLUB" also reported negative radar contact with the 
        object. "BOARDPIPE 27" reduced speed to avoid overrunning the object. At 
        this time "BOARDPIPE 27" traveling at .78 mach, heading of 310 degrees, 
        at an altitude of 30,500 ft, had running lights displayed, and was estimated 
        at 4820N-11240W.

03282 The pilot of "BOARDPIPE 27" estimated he had closed to four (4) miles of 
        the object. It is assumed that the object observed "BOARDPIPE 27" as he 
        object changed heading of 270 degrees to 350 degrees and increased speed 
        and began to climb. "BOARDPIPE 27" changed heading to 350 degrees and 
        increased to maximum speed.

03292 Radar observer of "BOARDPIPE 27" observed a white pink glow believed to be 
        in the tailpipe of an afterburner of a jet. From the position of the 
        radar observer, no sighting of the running lights was made.

03302 The pilot of "BOARDPIPE 27", heading at 350 degrees, estimated object to 
        be five (5) degrees in elevation at a range of approximately thirty (30) 
        miles on a heading of 350 degrees.

03322 Pilot of "BOARDPIPE 27" gave chase to the limits of the F-89J (13,500 ft 
        at a speed of .84 mach) with the object steadily pulling away.

03422 "CANADIAN CLUB" advised "BOARDPIPE 27" to break off pursuit as the object had disappeared from sight. Position of "BOARDPIPE 27" was 4950N-11300W.

03524 "BOARDPIPE 27" overheard the following garbled message from CALGARY RADIO (5107)-11A(LM): "CANADIAN ABYSS (numbers) - - - - CHANGE TO CHANNEL - - - - - -"

04022 "BOARDPIPE 27" overheard the following message transmitted in the blind: "CALGARY RADIO AND ALL FACILITIES GOING OFF THE AIR UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE"

04174 "BOARDPIPE 27" landed at HALLIBURTON AIR FORCE BASE, MONTANA without making radar contact with object.

COMMENTS OF INTERVIEWING OFFICIAL: The MG-12 Fire Control System (P-84) did not have any radar contacts after 02197 25 March 1959. An attempt by "CANADIAN CLUB" to check the MG-12 radar on the return flight proved fruitless. No other abnormal conditions were noted. The day following the sighting, the MG-12 radar was checked and found to be out of calibration. The Communications and Electronics Officer at the 90lst Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, HALLIBURTON AIR FORCE BASE, MONTANA, stated that during this particular time of the year, with certain weather conditions, the FPS-20 GCI radar has been known to give false or no information on the scope. The Duty OCI Director of "CANADIAN CLUB" stated that he contacted the DETECTION (CANADA) MOVEMENTS AND IDENTIFICATION CENTER airborne from 03152 to 04125 March 1959. The MOVEMENTS AND IDENTIFICATION CENTER reported no aircraft in the area at that time. It is the belief of the interviewing Official that this was an aircraft of some type, based on the report by the pilot and radar observer of the P-84.

1. Your attention is invited to SECRET message from 801st ACWRON dated 23 March 1959, Cite No. OPS 1314. The analysis, comments and questions raised by various staff agencies at this headquarters are forwarded for your information and review.

a. "A theory held by personnel of this Directorate is that the UFO could have been an aircraft with radar absorbent paint. Due to the aircraft's position in relation to the B-52, jet engines could have given the radar return which was picked up by the B-52." (ADC Intelligence comment)

b. "Consideration should be given to Canadian CF-100 or U.S. U-2. Either aircraft should have reflected well on the FPS-20 at SM-147 unless the power out-put was well below normal." (ADC Operations comment)

c. "The development of radar absorbent materials has been going on for a number of years with only limited success. As of 1957, a honey-comb material shown the greatest promise. This material can be used as a coating or, in some cases, as part of the structure to be camouflaged. However, it is only effective from 2500 to 13,000 megacycles and at the lower frequency than required thicknesses becomes prohibitive (one inch). To go down to 1300 MCs the thickness must be increased by a factor of two. The thicker material is ill-adapted to complex shapes and cannot be flown at high mach or through weather.

"Since the UFO demonstrated a high performance and was painted by a high frequency radar, some doubt is cast on the credibility of the radar absorbent

theory. There is, however, the possibility that a major break-through has been made in the field of radar absorption materials since 1957. The returns to the high frequency radar could then have been due to frequency sensitive materials having been used or merely returns from uncoated portions of the aircraft - such as the inside of the engine nacelles.

"Reference basic message. Answers to these additional questions would be most helpful to a complete analysis.

(1) Did the F-89 "skin-paint" the F-39 during the identification intercept?

(2) Did the ground radar site attempt to paint the UFO by means of their FPS-8 height finder? Results?

(3) Did the F-39 paint the UFO on its fire control radar?

(4) Were other FPS-20 radars in the area contacted for possible track information?" (ADC Communications and Electronics Comment)

2. In view of the fact that this sighting suggests a possibility of a different type of threat to the Continental United States, request this Headquarters, ATTN: ADDRI, be advised of your final analysis regarding this sighting.

Subject UFO appears to have attributes of a normal aircraft both in speed and maneuverability. There is no information in the report which would indicate any other type of airborne vehicle such as a balloon. Neither does the information indicate anomalous propagation, weapon propulsion, or equipment malfunction. Hence, no satisfactory explanation can be offered from a radar equipment standpoint.

            However, with respect to Jet engines and the properties of radar absorbing
            materials are true. However, there is not sufficient factual data to
            identify changing the original estimate that from the data available the

SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient features of narrative report. Begin narrative text on AF Form 112)
I. SUMMARY: This report contains information about an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) observation on 26 March 1959. The observation was made by a B-52 aircraft commander and his crew while flying on a HEADSTART II type mission. The B-52 aircraft was flying at 32,000 ft on a southerly heading when contrails were sighted slightly above and to the west of the B-52. The contrails proceeded northward and out of sight. Within a short period of time (approximately four (4) minutes), the tail gunner picked up an object on his scope. The object was also detected by the Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) and two (2) radar frequencies were determined as being utilized by the UFO. The UFO was maintained on the KB-9 scope for approximately one (1) hour at ranges of 8,000 to 15,000 yards. A ground CP1 station was notified upon initial contact with the UFO and a P-89 interceptor was launched at the time UFO penetrated Northern ADIZ. Soon after tail gunner picked off the UFO on scope, the UFO moved off to the rear of the scope and disappeared.

I.    DESCRIPTION OF SOURCE: The crew of the B-52, call sign, "OUTCOME 15".

II.   RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: All the crew members of "OUTCOME 15" appeared
to be highly observant, well trained in their duties and very intelligent in
their specific fields. They made no unsupported and for the most part unswervered
questions based only on the findings of their electronics gear where applicable.

III.  UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

    1. The following named crew members of "OUTCOME 15" were interviewed
    at FAIRCHILD AIR FORCE BASE (A737N-1137N), WASHINGTON, on 31 March 1959.

    CAPT JACKSON, JOHN W.        A0815189        Aircraft Commander
    CAPT BECK, JAY H.            A0806389        Co-pilot

    TSGT JONES, JOE (NMI)        AF18335234      Tail Gunner

    2. "OUTCOME 15" was participating in a HEADSTART II MISSION and after
    flying north to 55200-104200, turned to a southerly heading. Position reports
    were made to SASKATOON RADIO (5200N-104500).

    3. At 023625Z under VFR conditions. An object, trailing intermittent, thin and non-
    persistent contrails and believed to be an aircraft, was sighted in the two (2)
    o'clock position flying in a northerly direction, in contrast, "OUTCOME 15"
    was laying readily visible and persistent contrails even though it appeared that
    the object was at a higher altitude. The contrails pattern left by the object
    gave no clue to the number of engines. The path of the object was in the after-
    glow of the sunset and no lights were discernible. The tail gunner observed,
    that the object continued in a northerly direction with slight variations in its
    flight path until it was in a direct rear-wing flight, and then the object dis-
    appeared.

    4. At 024252 the tail gunner made the first electronic contact with
    an object on the scope of a MPN-9. At this time "OUTCOME 15" was flying at a
    true airspeed of 375 kts and the object was following at 8,000 yards.

    5. "OUTCOME 15" called "CANADIAN CLUB" CONTROL CENTER (A738N-111100)
    at 024252, reported that an object was trailing them. "CANADIAN CLUB" stated
    that they would launch an interceptor if the object was still with them when
    they penetrated the NORTHERN ADIZ to the states. As "OUTCOME 15" passed 3LIFT
    QUARTER RADIO (5030N-100200), SWIFT CURRENT RADIO was queried whether or not a
    fighter was in the area. The reply was affirmative, however, the fighter was
    east of SWIFT CURRENT.

    6. The EWO detected the object on the nose-tail warning system (AN/
    APS54) soon after notification by the tail gunner, and at 03052 detected the
    object on the Air-Air-PPI. The object was determined to have radar position on
    9135 megacycles. The object's radar never locked on "OUTCOME 15" but just kept
    sweeping with approximately one (1) second sweep frequency. The frequency tend-
    ed to oscillate from one (1) sweep to the next but still maintained the 9135
    megacycles. The EWO maintained contact with object for approximately twenty
    (20) minutes. The EWO then dialed to search other bands and finally returned to

7. Near HAVEN (4830N-11000W) MONTANA, "OUTCOME 15" changed course from a southerly heading to a westerly heading. The airspeed was increased from 375 kts to 420 kts and maintained increased from 32,000 ft to 31,000 ft in order to facilitate a refueling near CUTBANK (4835N-11340W) MONTANA. At this time, the tail gunner observed on the F-89, that the object had fallen back to 15,000 yards. The object then pulled up to 10,000 yards, paused momentarily, then closed to 8,000 yards.

8. "OUTCOME 15" passed CUTBANK, MONTANA at 0326Z and began final closure with the tanker for a rendezvous at approximately 0337Z.

9. At 0336Z the EWO again made contact with the object but on 91,30 megacycles. Contact was maintained for a period of about five (5) minutes, then it was permanently lost. The object's pulse recurrence frequency was estimated to be 2500.

10. It was during this period of time, as "OUTCOME 15" was closing with the tanker, that the tail gunner observed the F-89 approaching; the closest on the scope. The F-89 was at 6,000 yards and the object was at 8,000 yards when the object turned to the rear and disappeared. It was difficult for the tail gunner to follow the activity from this point on as "OUTCOME 15" was turning to the tanker. Up to this point the tail gunner had maintained continuous contact with the object. The tail gunner believed the object created a larger return on the scope of the MB-9 than was normal for a fighter. During the period time that both the object and the F-89 were painted on the MB-9, the object was giving a larger return than the F-39.

11. Throughout the encounter with the object, "OUTCOME 15" was squawking Mode 1 on IFF.
