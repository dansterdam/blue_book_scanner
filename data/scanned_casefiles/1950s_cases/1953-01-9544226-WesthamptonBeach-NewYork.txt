DETAILS:

1. This investigation requested by the Commanding General, 26th Air Division, Roslyn, New York, by letter dated 16 January 1953, file GADI(CM), concerning an unidentified, uncontrolled moving object sighted by Mrs. MAXELL, 215 Westhampton Beach, New York, of seeing an unidentified object at 0620 to 0120. The object looked like a star, was red on top and moved very slowly.

WESTHAMPTON BEACH, NEW YORK

2. Mrs. [redacted], North Beach Road, Westhampton Beach, New York, was interviewed by the writer at her home on 29 January 1953. She stated that on 15 January 1953, between 1600 hours to 1830 hours, 15 January 1953, in the tower of the Westhampton Beach High School at the class 12 hour observation, she advised that at approximately 1620 hours she observed an object which she at first in night so he an airman was very slowly into her view, traveling in a "westerly direction, northwest or west."

MAXELL could not describe its shape or size, or estimate its height or speed, except to say that it moved very slowly and appeared to waver. The unknown object was very high and at first appeared to have a "reddish glow" on the top, and later as it began to get dark it glowed white and looked like a star. Mrs. [redacted] further stated that a proximately twenty (20) minutes after lighting the first object she sighted a second object, exactly like the first, traveling quite rapidly and approaching the town from a "westerly" direction. It appeared to half circle the first object and then travel at the same speed and in the same direction as the first object.

She watched both objects until it grew dark, approximately one and one-half (1Â½) hours after sighting the first object, at which time they looked like stars and were lost to her view. Interviewed again by telephone, she contacted the New Haven, Connecticut, Civil Defense Filter Center. She stated that she reported these as unidentified objects, but the New York State Filter Center, particularly because of their "wavering", stated that she reported weather balloons, particularly because of their "wavering". Mrs. [redacted] further stated that she heard no sound from the objects and that all of her observation was with the naked eyes.

3. Miss [redacted] Village Clark, Westhampton Beach, New York, was interviewed by the writer at the Village Hall on 29 January 1953. She stated that [redacted] was a respected member of the community and is honest, dependable, trustworthy, and loyal to the United States government.

SUFFOLK COUNTY AIR FORCE BASE, WESTHAMPTON BEACH, N.Y.

4. Captain DONALD M. COHEN, AO 931 495, USAF, 126-9 Weather Detachment Base Weather Officer, was interviewed by the writer on 29 January 1953.
