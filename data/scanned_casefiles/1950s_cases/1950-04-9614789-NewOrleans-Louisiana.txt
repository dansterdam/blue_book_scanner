15. Speed: Approximately the speed of an airplane landing.

16. Sound and odors: None.

17. Trail: None.

18. Luminosity: None.

19. Projections: None.

20. Maneuvers: Sailing steadily toward shore of Lake Pontchartrain, gradually losing altitude until it landed. After landing, it appeared to hesitate a second or two and mainly tried to rise. Lifting itself a little distance, then falling back to earth (or water), hesitated another second and tried to rise again. It fell again and seemed to more or roll a short distance and come to a standstill.

21. Manner of disappearance: There was a faint reflection, appearing as though from behind the levees, and then all went dark.

22. Effect on clouds: None.

23. Additional information concerning object: Mr. [redacted] after seeing the object, traveled approximately four (4) miles up the lakeshore in an automobile trying to locate the object. At no time during the time Mr. [redacted] observed the object did it lose shape or color. Observer is of the opinion that the object may have been made of plastic and in the shape of a balloon as the color was very uniform and the object appeared to be a perfect ball of orange or red, with no glare of light emanating from it.

According to the United States Weather Bureau, at 2330 hours, on the night of 12 April 1950, the wind was blowing west four (4) miles per hour; sky was thinly overcast; lower broken clouds at 9000 feet; visibility was ten (10) miles.

25. Name and address of observer: Mr. Harold [redacted] (Hammond road), New Orleans, Louisiana and his wife observed the object also, and her observation of the object was the same as that of Mr. [redacted].

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

Did observer wear glasses? Both Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] usually wear ordinary reading glasses, but were not wearing glasses during their observation of the object. Mr. [redacted] stated that last fall (1949) he was lying in bed gazing out of the same window from which he observed the object on the night of 12 April 1950, and noticed what he first thought was lightning from a plane at an altitude of approximately 1500 feet. He remembered that lights on planes go on and off. Since the light he saw was continuous, he did not believe the object to be the light of a plane. No report was made of that object by Mr. [redacted] until it went out of sight.
