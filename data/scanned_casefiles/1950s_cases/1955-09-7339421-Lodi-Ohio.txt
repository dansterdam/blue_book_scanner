II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a very quiet and timid person. She had recently undergone a heart operation and was not in very good health. She is under the influence of her mother's                 and tends to believe what her mother believes. It is concluded that the information contained in this report is made up largely of the information she heard from her mother rather than that of herself. It is therefore the opinion of this investigator that the information is not reliable.

III. SOURCE's DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. SOURCE was visiting her mother at                 Ohio (GJM 5002) when a phone call came Mr.             also of             informed them of an object in the sky. Time of call was 23/0315 Sept 55. SOURCE saw the object in question in the South East at a bearing of 135° and 60° azimuth.

2. At the same time, a searchlight beacon, which was identified as from the Akron Airport (GJM 210A) by SOURCE's mother, was visible. SOURCE said the beacon was at             lights on the scattered clouds and haze in the vicinity of 20°. Bearing of the beacon was 90° with an azimuth of 20°.

3. SOURCE returned into the house after only a few minutes as she was not in good health. While she observed the object, it appeared to move slowly West. During her sighting, she heard two faint explosions accompanied with a bright exhaust from the object. No other sounds were heard.

4. SOURCE stated object was round and sharply outlined with a red color. Size was about that of a grapefruit held at arm's length. No estimate of its size, speed or altitude could be given due to lack of reference points.

5. At the time of the sighting, the weather was dry and cool with no wind and scattered clouds and haze. Only a few stars were visible and the moon was not in sight.

I. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted], Ohio
Age: 32
Present Position: [redacted]
Education: High School, College
Qualification: Member of the Army Air Force from 1943 to 1946 serving as a Flight Engineer.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was very pleasant and earnest, cooperating in every way. He stated he was still very interested in the Air Force and did a great deal of reading to keep up on the latest developments. His manner reflected his intelligence. He is well respected throughout the community. The information contained in this report is considered accurate to the best of the SOURCE's ability, however, it is further believed it is a misconception of a known object.

III. SOURCE's DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. SOURCE was walking from his garage to his home after returning from work. Looking into the sky Eastward, he noticed a light on a bearing of 95° and a azimuth of 45°. Time was 0000 Zebra hours 23 Sept 55 (2200 hours 22 Sept 55 EDST). At first SOURCE thought the object was a searchlight beacon, but after watching for several minutes, came to the conclusion that it was a flying object unidentifiable to him. At 0315 Zebra hours 23 Sept 55 (2215 hours 22 Sept 55 EDST) he called Mrs. Rose M. Presnick, who is the local GOC Observer, and reported the object to her for her collaboration.

2. The object was following a circular pattern, emerging from out of a haze in the East and disappearing into the haze again in the South East. SOURCE watched the object for a total of 45 minutes. The pattern of the object was regular and took one (1) minute and fifteen (15) seconds for each revolution.

3. The sight was described as hazy in the East with scattered clouds overhead. No wind was evident and it was warm and dry with no trace of daylight.

4. Sound of the object was described as more like that of a rocket as opposed to that of a jet. Color was blue gray center with bright white fringe. When first sighted, the outline was sharp, but became fuzzy before disappearing. SOURCE stated this could be because of the increase in the haze coverage.

5. Several times during sighting, SOURCE saw another, smaller object flying near the larger object. It appeared to him as if the smaller object was attempting to make contact with the larger. No increase in sound was evident when both objects were in view. Color of the smaller was the same as the larger.

6. During the time of the sighting, SOURCE saw and heard a aircraft pass over from the East to the South. He said he could definitely recognize it as a conventional type aircraft as he was used to seeing them often. He believes the town of Lodi is on a course of a regular airlines.

7. Unknown object appeared as large as a basketball and was estimated as 20 feet in diameter, traveling at 400 miles per hour. SOURCE could not

I looked our store at 2200 Sept 22, 1955 went home. I stopped in breeze way looking to the east and saw this bright light in the sky. - It went south then turned east and went out of sight. It returned from a north east direction following came flight pattern. I watched this object follow the same pattern for 15 min. It took 1 min and 15 sec to make its pattern. Then at 2245 it went in a south east course and out of sight. I was sure that it was not a searchlight - it was some kind of air ship. - It flew like a airplane and had speed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:

1. A check with the Akron Municipal Airport at Akron, Ohio revealed the following information:

    a. Their revolving beacon was operating between the hours of dusk and dawn on 22-23 Sept 1955. This beacon operates during these hours throughout the year. Revolutions per minute of the beacon is six (6).

    b. Two (2) searchlights, sixty (60) inch, arc, were operating during the evening of 22 Sept 1955. One, located approximately eight hundred (800) feet from the boundary of the airport to the West (see incl. #1) and another about one half (1/2) mile to the West of the airport (see incl. #1). These were being used for advertising purposes of a Gas Filling Station and a County Fair respectively. Revolutions of these searchlights very slow.

    c. It was also learned that the Columbia Chemical Works in Barberton, Ohio (see incl. #1), between Lodi and Akron pours chemicals into "settling beds" which take in an area of approximately three acres. The clouds coming off these beds are known locally as the Barberton Front. This mass of clouds, mist and/or haze has been seen to rise at times, to an altitude of 30,000 feet. It definitely influences the visibility of the Akron Airport at times. These cloud formations have been responsible for many strange phenomena in the past; causing reflections on clouds from beds and other light sources.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the objects seen by the observers can be resolved as known objects for the following reasons:

    a. In the case of the sighting by ROSE M. PRESZNICK and ELAINE M. MONACHINO there were two objects observed. One a known object and she other unknown. The known object was that of a searchlight projecting light on the overcast to the East of them. The unknown object was described to the investigator rather vaguely. The direction of travel was Westerly from the South East to the South West. Sound of the object was faint and steady with the exception of "two explosions like that of a firecracker." Even the sounds of the "explosions" were very faint. It is therefore considered that she cannot be absolutely sure they didn't come from the ground, a possible, and more logical explanation is considered the resolution of the sighting and became apparent during the conversation with JOSEPH F. LEATHERMAN.

    b. In the case of the sighting by JOSEPH F. LEATHERMAN there were also two objects seen. One a known and the other unknown. The known object was that of an aircraft passing from the East to the South West. Direction of travel was West by South West. Altitude was high but the sound was still distinguishable - but to him, possibly due to his Air Force experience. It seems that this is the UFO reported by ROSE M. PRESZNICK. The unknown object in this case, was described circling in a very definite pattern. Although Mr. LEATHERMAN was certain that the object was an air vehicle of some sort, it seems that he was mistaken as all evidence as received from MRS PRESZNICK and the Akron Airport point to the fact that what was actually seen was a light from a searchlight beacon projected on the overcast.

I. SOURCE: [redacted] (Civilian)
   Age: 52
   Address: [redacted], Ohio
   Present Position: GOC Post Supervisor and housewife
   Education: High School
   Qualifications: Been a member of the GOC for nearly one year and received GOC training from a representative from the Santon, Ohio, GOC Filter Center.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a pleasant woman, very friendly and anxious to cooperate, well-known throughout the surrounding community and well respected. SOURCE had made a slightly on three previous occasions, at these time she was not a member of the GOC and was reluctant to report them for fear of ridicule. Although SOURCE was intelligent and talked with assurance, it is the opinion of this investigator that she is prone to let herself imagine she sees things other than what is actually before her. The information contained in this report is considered to be unreliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. SOURCE received a call from Mr. [redacted] at 23/0315Z Sept 55 requesting she look into the South East sector of the sky to confirm his sighting of an unidentified flying object. SOURCE complied and saw the object.

2. Object was on a bearing of approximately 135° with an azimuth of approximately 60°. At the same time, SOURCE recognized the searchlight beacon from the Akron Airport(GJM 210h) about 30 miles East of SOURCE'S location. The beacon was rotating in a counter-clock-wise direction and casting reflections on the clouds and haze in the area.

3. The object was in view for a period of 25 minutes during which time it traveled from the South East to the South West where it suddenly disappeared. On two occasions during its flight, SOURCE heard a faint explosion, as that of a firecracker, and simultaneously observed a bright orangeish-blue exhaust from the object.

4. The night was dry with no moon. Scattered clouds in the vicinity and haze about one-fourth of the sky. No ground wind was noticed. Only a few stars were in evidence.

5. SOURCE heard only a faint whirring sound other than the explosions. She could not estimate the speed nor the altitude as there was no point to use as a reference. The object appeared round at first, assuming an elliptical shape as it continued on its course. During sighting, the object appeared about the size of a grapefruit held at arm's length.

6. The object had a blue-gray color with the edges much brighter than the center. SOURCE stated she had never seen anything before that gave the same appearance. When investigator described a jet aircraft cutting in its afterburners, SOURCE seemed this was not what she had seen.
