I. SOURCE:
   (civilian)
   address: ________, Cleveland 4, Ohio
   age: 25
   Present Position: Housewife
   Education: High School
   QUALIFICATIONS: none

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a very quiet and timid person. She had recently undergone a heart operation and was not in very good health. She is under the influence of her mother; and seems to believe what her mother believes. It is considered that the information contained in this report is made up largely of the information she heard from her mother rather than that of herself. It is therefore the opinion of this investigator that the information is not reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
   1. SOURCE was visiting her mother at also _______, Ohio (GJEM 5902) when a phone call from Mr. _______ also Mr. _______ informed them of an object in the sky. Time of call was 25/03/55; Sept 55. SOURCE saw the object in question in the Sky Southeast at a bearing of 135° and 60° azimuth.

   2. At the same time, a searchlight beacon, which was identified as from the Akron Airport (A/UM 2104) by SOURCE's mother, was visible. SOURCE said the beacon was throwing lights on the scattered clouds and haze in the vicinity in which it was rotating. Bearing of the beacon was 90° with an azimuth of 20°.

   3. SOURCE returned into the house after only a few minutes as she was not in good health. While she observed the object, it appeared to move slowly West. During her sighting, she heard two faint explosions accompanied with a bright exhaust from the object. No other sounds were heard.

   4. SOURCE stated object was round and sharply outlined with a red color. Size was about that of a grapefruit held at arm’s length. No estimate of its size speed or altitude could be given due to lack of reference point. 

   5. At the time of the sighting, the weather was dry and cool with no wind and scattered clouds and haze. Only a few stars were visible and the moon was not in sight.

I. SOURCE:
Address:  ████████████████████ Ohio
Age: 32
Present Position: ████████████████
Education: High School, College
Qualification: Member of the Army Air Force from 1943 to 1946 serving as a Flight Engineer.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was very pleasant and earnest, cooperating in every way. He stated he was still very interested in the Air Force and did a great deal of reading to keep up on the latest developments. His manner reflected his intelligence. He is well respected throughout the community. The information contained in this report is considered accurate to the best of the SOURCE’s ability, however, it is further believed it is misdescription of a known object.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
1. SOURCE was walking from his garage to his home after returning from work. Looking into the sky Eastward, he noticed a light on a bearing of 95° and a azimuth of 45°. Time was 0900 Zebra hours 23 Sept 55 (2200 hours 22 Sept 55 RST). At first SOURCE thought object was a searchlight beacon, but after watching for several minutes, came to the conclusion that it was a flying object unidentified. Flight B, Light A, O915 Zebra hours 23 Sept 55 (2215 hours 22 Sept 55 RST) he called to Mrs. Rose M. Preszork, who is the local CC Observer, and reported the object and her for her collaboration.
2. The object was following a circular pattern, emerging from out of a haze in the East and disappearing into the haze again in the South East. SOURCE watched the object for a total of 15 minutes. This pattern object followed was regular and took one (1) minute and fifteen (15) seconds for each revolution.
3. The flight was described as hazy in the East with scattered clouds overhead. No wind was evident and it was warm and dry with no trace of daylight.
4. Sound of the object was described as more like that of a rocket as opposed to that of a jet. Color was blue gray center with bright white fringe. When first sighted, the outline was sharp, but became fuzzy before disappearing. SOURCE stated this could be because of the increase in the haze coverage.
5. Several times during sighting, SOURCE saw another, smaller object flying near the larger object. It appeared to him as if the smaller object was attempting to make contact with the larger. No increases in sound was evident when both objects were in view. Color of the smaller was the same as the larger.
6. During the times of the sighting, SOURCE saw and heard a aircraft pass over from East to the South West. Sight said he could definitely recognize it as a conventional type aircraft as he was used to seeing them often. Flight 3A, Engine A, regular airlines.
7. Unknown object appeared as large as a basketball and was estimated as 20 feet in diameter, traveling at 400 miles per hour. SOURCE could not state.

I looked the store at 2200 Sept 22, 1955 went home. I stopped in breezeway looking to the east and saw this bright light in the sky - It went south then turned east and went out of sight. It returned from a north east direction following same flight pattern. I watched this object follow the same pattern for 45 min. It took minimum of 15 sec. to make this pattern. Then at 2245 it went in a south east course and out of sight. I was sure that it was not a searchlight - it was some kind of air ship - it flew like a airplane and it had speed.

REPORT NO 38-U703-1-55  
FLIGHT 3-B, 4602d AISS  
PAGE FOUR OF 15 PAGES

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with the Akron Municipal Airport at Akron, Ohio revealed the following information:

   a. That revolving beacon was operating between the hours of dusk and dawn on 22-23 Sept 1955. This beacon operates during these hours throughout the year. Revolutions per minute of the beacon is six (6).

   b. Two (2) searchlights, sixty (60) inch, arc, were operating during the evening of 22 Sept 1955. One, located approximately eight hundred (800) feet from the boundary of the airport to the west (see Incl. # 1). These were being used for advertising purposes of a Gas Filling Station and a County Fair respectively. Revolutions of these searchlights very slow.

   c. It was also learned that the Columbia Chemical Works in Barberton, Ohio (see Incl. # 1)?, spread Lodi and Akron clouds chemicals into "settling beds" which look like the Barberton area. The source of out of these includes known locally as "fog", to an altitude of 300,000 feet. It definitely influences the visibility of the Akron Airport at times. These cloud formations have been responsible for many air night accidents in the past; causing reflections on the clouds from the beds and other light sources.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
(REPORT NO. 3B-UFO3-1-55 PART FIVE)

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER;

1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the objects seen by the observers can be resolved as known objects for the following reasons:

a. In the case of the sighting by ROSE M. PRESZNICK and ELAINE M. FONACHINO there were two objects observed. One a known object and the other unknown. The known object was the outline of a searchlight going into the overcast to the East of them. The unknown object was described as the "biggest fireball" vaguely. The direction of travel was Westerly from the South East to the South West. Sound of the object was faint and steady with the exception of "two explosions like that of a firecracker." Even the sounds of the "explosions" were very faint. It is therefore considered that she cannot be absolutely sure they didn't come from another source, possibly on the ground. A possible, and more logical explanation is considered the resolution of the sighting and became apparent during the conversation with JOSEPH F. LEATHERMAN.

b. In the case of the sighting by JOSEPH F. LEATHERMAN there were also two objects seen. One a known end the other unknown. The known object was that of an aircraft passing overhead from the East to the South West. Direction of travel was West by South West. Altitude was high but the sound was still distinguishable as that, possibly due to his AF experience. It seems that this is the UFOs reported by ROSE M. PRESZNICK. The unknown object in this case, was described circling in a very definite pattern. Although Mr. LEATHERMAN was certain that the object was an air vehicle of some sort, it seems that he was mistaken as all evidence as received from MTS PRESZNICK and the Akron Airport point to the fact that what was actually seen was a light from a searchlight beacon projected on the overcast.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was caused by searchlight activity.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO 3B-UFOB-2-1-55 PART ONE
FLIGHT 3-3, 4602A AISS PAGE 2 OF 9/15 PAGES

I.  SOURCE: (Civilian)
    Age: 52
    Address: Ohio
    Present Position: GOC Post Supervisor and housewife
    Education: High School
    Qualifications: Been a member of the GOC for nearly one year and received GOC training from a representative from the Eaton, Ohio, GOC Filter Center.
    
II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a pleasant woman, very friendly and anxious to cooperate, well-known throughout the surrounding community and well respected. SOURCE had made sightings on three previous occasions; at these times she was not a member of the GOC and was reluctant to report them for fear of ridicule. Although SOURCE was intelligent and talked with assurance, it is the opinion of this Investigator that she is prone to let herself imagine she sees things other than what is actually before her. The information contained in this report is considered to be unreliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
    1. SOURCE received a call from Mr. ___ at 23/03152 Sept 55 requesting she look into the South East sector of the sky to confirm his sighting of an unidentified flying object. SOURCE complied and saw the object.
    2. Object was on a bearing of approximately 135° with an azimuth of approximately 60°. At the same time, SOURCE recognized the aser!ircraft beacon from the Akron Airport(GJTM 210+) about 30 miles East of SOURCE's location. The beacon was rotating in a counter-clockwise direction and casting reflections on the clouds and haze in the area.
    3. The object was in view for a period of 25 minutes during which time it traveled from the South East to the South West where it suddenly disappeared. On two occasions during its flight, SOURCE heard a faint explosion, as that of a firecracker, and simultaneously observed a bright orangeish-blue exhaust from the object.
    4. The night was dry with no moon. Scattered clouds in the vicinity and haze obscured about one-fourth of the sky. No ground wind was noticed. Only a few stars were in evidence.
    5. SOURCE heard only a faint whirring sound other than the explosions. She could not estimate the speed nor the altitude as there was no point to use as a reference. The object appeared round at first, assuming an elliptical shape as it continued on its course. During sightings, the object appeared about the size of a grapefruit held at arms length.
    6. The object had a blue-gray color with the edges much brighter than the center. SOURCE stated she had never seen anything before that gave the same appearance. When Investigator described a jet aircraft cutting in its afterburners, SOURCE amended this was not what she had seen.
