THE VISUAL CHECK AFTER RECEIVING THE REPORT AND STATED HE
SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL. HE DID SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A VERY
BRIGHT STAR IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE OBSERVER.

(12) OBSERVERS STATED THEY HAD TAKEN TWO PICTURES OF THE

If the officer was other than the
bright star seen by the OD, he would
have seen it. The observers probably
saw the bright star and it just
appeared to move, caused by atmospheric
conditions.
