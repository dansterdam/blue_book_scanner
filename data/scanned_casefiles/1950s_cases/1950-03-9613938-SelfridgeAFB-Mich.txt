SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: Director of Intelligence, Headquarters United States Air
Force, Washington 25, D. C.

1. Attached for your information are two narrative reports concerning radar sighting of an unidentified flying object.

2. The fact that the object was sighted on the scopes of two (2)
radars is considered worthy of special note.

3. Comment of technical experts, this headquarters, was solicited
and is quoted in part for your consideration:

a. "While it is relatively well known that various ionospheric
conditions cause reflections at lower frequencies, it is usually considered that these layers have no effect at the frequencies used by the two
radar sets mentioned except when temperature inversion or other atmospheric or tropospheric conditions cause ducting and spurious reflections.
Presuming that such idealized conditions existed at the time of these
observations, it is conceivable that an actual small change in physical
lateral motion in reference to the radar set could cause a seemingly
greater change in relative position of the 'object' as observed on the
radar scope due to the varying path lengths the radar energy takes to
and from the 'object' as a function of the frequency sensitive layers
and angles of incidence of the propagated wave. However, the great difference in the frequencies of the L-Band GPS-5 and the S-Band GPS-4
radar sets and the evident correlation of observations between these two
sets almost rule out the possibility of anomalous propagation effects.
Further, the magnitude of the velocity and accelerations of the three
dimensional movements of the 'object' reported are beyond the capability
of known heavier or lighter than air vehicles in controlled flight.

b. "Also substantiating this unlikelihood, is the fact that
the 'object' was reported as remaining stationary in free space for a
man-period of two minutes.

c. "Further validity is lent to the contention of the reports
by statements that first indications, which were at high altitudes, were

observed on the CPS-4 height-finder before being observed on the CPS-5 surveillance radar set. This follows logic and field experience, inasmuch as the high altitude coverage of the CPS-5 is known to be poor and the antenna is not capable of being automatically tilted as in the case of the CPS-4 on which the controller may tilt the antenna within wide limits to observe any high altitude or high angle objects. It is to be noted that previous field experience with a CPS-5 surveillance radar set has indicated that targets picked up at ranges and altitudes indicated in a subject report would probably have a reflection aspect ratio in the order of magnitude of a B-29 or greater.

4. "In the absence of detailed vertical and horizontal coverage charts for the specific radar sites and comprehensive weather reports for the area during the period of time these observations were noted, a more complete study or evaluation at this time is not feasible.

5. In summary, no known electronic phenomena, nor combinations of several electronic phenomena could conceivably produce all of the observations covered by these reports."

4. The frequency of reports of this nature has recently increased; instructions have therefore been directed to all radar installations within this command to report scope sightings of unusual objects.

5. It is recommended that reports of unidentified object sightings be reconsidered for submission from all Zone of Interior Air Force agencies.

1ST LT NARRATIVE REPORT OF 661ST AC & W SQ, SELFRIDGE AFB, MICH.

On the first occasion of noticing the strange object S bar 50, at 2805, I had just come from the Selfridge AFB Officers' Club and at I turned down Wright Blvd. on the way home I noticed a strange object directly over the Post Exchange Bldg., descending vertically at a slow rate. I stopped the car and watched this object descend to an approximate height of 5,000 feet, hovering there for approximately one (1) minute then proceeding in a westerly direction to approximately fifty (50) miles west of my position. Then the object turned south and flew approximately fifty (50) miles, then turned around and flew back north for approximately fifty (50) miles, then stopped and disappeared from my view. The above took place in four minutes (time checked with my personal wrist watch).

True perspective was not possible because it did not diminish in size or intensity as it increased its distance from me. The movement was a steady above but I cannot state the figures given above as accurate, because of the false perspective. An airplane flew by on an approximate heading of 285° at 3,000 feet just after the object moved on a heading of 270°. It was easy to determine the relative size and the diminishing size of this aircraft (C-47), as it proceeded on its course and completely faded at approximately eight (8) miles.

The object was distinguished from an airplanes by its vertical descent and its great speed in the lateral plane. It was distinguished from heavenly bodies by its rapid change in relative position from the vertical to the horizontal. Also its abrupt change in course.

The only way I can describe the light from this object is by comparing it to the light of a house window at night, at a distance of thirty (30) yards and the yellowish glow it gives off. The object had a slightly darker color and a greater intensity than a house light as mentioned above.

The object did not light up the area beneath it, although it seemed to burn with an extremely intense dull light, nor did it light up the surrounding light haze. In watching this object I was unable to determine the size, the intensity and the size of the light did not change a readily (not noticeable to me) during the entire time I watched its movement.

Although I had just come from a stag party at the Officers' Club, I was completely sober, having only one glass of beer during the entire evening. Because of this, I did not mention this experience until 9:30, the next day I saw strange happenings on the radar scopes (AI/CPS-4 and AI/CPS-5 Radar).

Here is the text from the document:

The second experience was as follows: I went on duty as Controller at 1930, 8 March 1950. At 1945 hours a blip was pointed out to me that was at 270°, sixty-eight (68) miles, 40,000 feet (measured by the ERI scope). (Cpl and I) watched this blip and is did not move for three (3) minutes. Then faded. At 2002 hours the target was picked up again and it was at 40,000 feet, lateral movement was detected in a northeasterly direction; at this time I estimated the speed at 1,500 m.p.h. At 2006 hours a target appeared at 350°, fifty-eight (58) miles at 45,000 feet. There were four (4) jet aircraft flying in the local area at this time at 24,000 feet and the altitude of the jet aircraft on a bearing of 340°, thirty-eight (38) miles, was checked at 25,000 feet on the IKI scope. The pilot stated that he was flying at 24,000 feet. This lends support of the accuracy of the ERI scope. The strange object faded after one minute. Captain M. and Lt. L. came in and I left the radar scopes.

At 2020 hours I returned to the ERI scope to see an object at 350°, thirty-eight (38) miles climb from 30,000 feet to 45,000 feet in one (1) minute, with no lateral movement detected. I went off duty and left the GCI room at 2025 hours.

On the first occasion it was cloudless, moderately bright moonlight night, with a light haze; on the second occasion, it was clear with unrefuted visibility and moon.

I am 27 years of age and have been a rated pilot in the USAF since October 1942, having over 2,900 hours flying time. I have had seven (7) months experience as a Radar Controller.

           Scoped Caused by Metallic Targets)

1. SYNOPSIS: 1st Lt. [redacted], Radar Operator
and Controller, 661st AO & W Squadron, Selfridge Air Force Base, Mich.,
and 1st Lt. [redacted], same duties, were organizing, and while on
duty on 9 March 1950 observe in radar scopes unconventional "blip"
"Blip" acted in a peculiar manner. It was assumed
that the unidentified "blip" was of an unconventional type aircraft.
Observations of "Blip" are recorded by enlisted personnel on duty
during the concerned period of time.

2. DETAILS: [redacted] was on duty with the 661st Radar Section
on 9 March 1950 to control the positions of local jet aircraft. Observations and control were normal until approximately 1945 hours, at which
time an observed a "blip" on the "PPI" scope at approximately
40,000 feet, range and azimuth holding steady at 270°, 55 miles. "Blip"
was brilliant for a few seconds, then faded, and came back at a different
location approximately five (5) minutes later. At this time other radar
operators observed this "blip" and questioned it. The estimated speed,
which was not well founded but assumed to be about 2500 miles per hour,
is a combination of vertical speed and horizontal speed based on various
vectors derived from this system. The "blip" was observed when
picked up the second time to move laterally to a bearing of 340° and
was observed to be consistent for about three (3) minutes with the "PPI"
scope. [redacted] during this period of time, did not record the information in a log. However, his curiosity caused him to contact various
jet fighters in the area to determine their altitude, bearing, and
speed. [redacted] could be used as a double check on the radar scopes.

When left the Radar Room and turned over controller work to

Scopes Caused by Detectable Targets)

[The rest of the text is as follows:]

M. W. requested that the radar screens record in the log various sweeps and coordinate the various scopes. Then after five observed the unidentified "blip", he noted a very definite rapid decrease in altitude on "NRT" scope to about 15,000 feet. The blip was not noted. The "blip" was again picked up at approximately 2045 hours on the NPRT scope.

To facilitate understanding of bearings and azrs, a 360° circle divided into four (4) segments: the Clear quadrant, i.e., 0 to 90° being Zone 1, 90° to 180° Zone 2, 180° to 270° Zone 3, and 270° to 360° Zone 4, the radar lines being cardinal directions - north, east, south and west; some of the entries from the "NRT" scopes log reveal, at 2045 hours, 156°, 49 miles, phantom aircraft; 203 hours, 146°, 56 miles; 2049 hours, 136°, 73 miles; 2052 hours, 130°, 79 miles; 2105 hours, 127°, 86 miles; 2105 hours, 150°, 52 miles, 15,000 feet; 2106 hours, 175°, 38 miles, 21,000 feet; 2107 hours, 169°, 38 miles, 25,000 feet; 2109 hours, 210°, 48 miles; 2112 hours, 116°, 51 miles, 35,000 feet; 2113 hours, 110°, 56 miles, 35,000 feet; 2115 hours, 175°, 60 miles; 2136 hours, 215°, 48 miles, 35,000 feet. The "blip" was lost after a period of time, however, in various times throughout the evening, a one (1) to three (3) second observation was made of the unidentified "blip".

Both M. W. were agreed that the approximate size of the unidentified "blip" would be similar to a B-36 and that the "blip" at times appeared to come across the various jet fighters in Zones 2 and 4. M. W. also believes that the erratic vertical readings could be attributed on the part of the "blip" as it appeared to come after the radar could hold steady on the "blip" for a period of several seconds to a minute or 60 seconds. Further estimated speeds to be from 420 miles an hour horizontal to 6500 miles per hour vertical. They observed more activity to be in vertical motion than the Radar Room was in total darkness and the readings on the logs for the time element concerned would vary and it was caused by the man making recordings to have his watch position incorrect. Both M. W. recalled 15,000 feet altitude variations within a matter of seconds on the part of the unidentified "blip". The rapid change in vertical readings would occur between 30,000 and 45,000 feet. At one time, Lt. recalled the unidentified "blip" to a distance of 120 miles.

from the station in Zone 4 and in as close as 38 miles in Zone 4. Lt. _____ advised that on Friday, 3 March 1950, at approximately 2305 hours, after he had left a stag party in the Officers' Club and having had only one beer during the course of the evening, he had observed a yellowish light in the sky. _____ in this time was driving his car from the Officers' Club in the direction of the PI on Selfridge Air Force Base. He slowed his car down and observed the light, the size and its brilliancy undetermined but described to be an approximate color and size of an electric light within a house showing through a normal size window at a distance of about 50 to 75 feet on a dark night. The light was descending vertically over the base area and at first appeared to be a flare but, due to the color of the light, it was realized it could not have been a flare. When stopped his car and observed the light further. The light then proceeded westward holding the same azimuth for approximately 50 to 50 miles. The light then went southward approximately the same distance, stopping and returning northward from the center line of sight the same distance driving the north-south traverse approximately 50 to 100 miles. This occurred within four (4) minutes of time.
