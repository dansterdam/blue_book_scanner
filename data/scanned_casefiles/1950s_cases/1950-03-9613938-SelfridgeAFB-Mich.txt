CONTINENTAL AIR COMMAND

INT 373.8 (E)

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: Director of Intelligence, Headquarters United States Air Force, Washington 25, D. C. 

1. Attached for your information are two narrative reports concerning radar sighting of an unidentified flying object. 

2. The fact that the object was sighted on the scopes of two (2) radars is considered worthy of special note.

3. Comment of technical experts, this headquarters, was solicited and is quoted in part for your consideration:

     a. "While it is relatively well known that various ionospheric conditions cause reflections at lower frequencies, it is usually considered that these layers have no effect at the frequencies used by the two radar sets mentioned except when temperature inversion or other atmospheric or tropospheric conditions cause ducting and spurious reflections. Presuming that such idealized conditions existed at the time of these observations, it is conceivable that an actual small change in physical lateral motion in reference to the radar set could cause a seemingly greater change in relative position of the 'object' as observed on the radar scope due to the varying path lengths the radar energy makes to and from the 'object' as a function of the frequency sensitive layers and angles of incidence of the propagated wave. However, the great difference in the frequencies of the L-Band CPS-5 and the S-Band CPS-4 radar sets and the evident correlation of observations between these two sets almost rule out the possibility of anomalous propagation effects. Further, the magnitude of the velocities and accelerations of the three dimensional movements of the 'object' reported are beyond the capability of known heavier or lighter than air vehicles in controlled flight.

     b. "Also substantiating this unlikelihood, is the fact that the 'object' was reported as remaining stationary in free space for a mean-period of two minutes.

     c. "Further validity is lent to the contention of the reports by statements that first indications, which were at high altitudes, were

observed on the CPS-4 height-finder before being observed on the CPS-5 surveillance radar set. This follows logic and field experience, inasmuch as the high altitude coverage of the CPS-5 is known to be poor and the antenna is not capable of being automatically tilted as in the case of the CPS-4 on which the controller may tilt the antenna within wide limitations to observe any high altitude or high angle objects. It is to be noted that previous field experience with a CPS-5 surveillance radar set has indicated that targets picked up at ranges and altitudes indicated in subject report would probably have a reflection aspect ratio in the order of magnitude of a B-29 or greater.

d. "In the absence of detailed vertical and horizontal coverage charts for the specific radar sites and comprehensive weather reports for the area during the period of time these observations were noted, a more complete study or evaluation at this time is not feasible.

"In summary, no known electronic phenomena, nor combinations of several electronic phenomena could conceivably produce all of observations covered by the attached reports."

4. The frequency of reports of this nature has recently increased, instructions have therefore been directed to all radar installations within this command to report scope sightings of unusual objects.

5. It is recommended that reports of unidentified object sightings be reconsidered for submission from all Zone of Interior Air Force agencies.

NARRATIVE REPORT OF 

1ST LT  . , 661ST AC W SQ, SELFINDGE AFB, YICH. 

On the first occasion of noticing the strange object 3 Mar 50, 
at 2305, I had just come from the Self ridge AFB Officer's Club and 
as I turned down lright 31vd. on the way to the main gate I noticed 
a strange object directly over the Post Exhange Bldg., descending 
vertically at a slow rate. I stopped the car and watched this 
object descend to an approximate height of 5,000 feet, hovering 
there for approximate one (1) minute then proceeding in a westerly 
direction to approximately fifty (50) miles west of my position. 
Then the object turned south and flew approximately fifty (50) miles, 
then turned around and flew back north for approximately fifty (50) 
miles, then stopped and disappeared from my view. The above took 
place in four minutes (time checked with my personal wrist watch). 

True prospective was not possible because it did not diminish 
in size or intensity as it increased its distance from me. The 
movement was as stated above but I cannot state the figures given 
above as accurate, because of the false prospective. An airplane 
flew by on an approximate heading of 285° at 3,000 feet just after 
the object moved on a heading of 270°. It was easy to determine 
the relative size and the diminishing size of this aircraft (C-47), 
but the object in its course and completely faded at approximately 
eight (8) miles. 

The object was distinguished from an airplane by its vertical 
descent and its great speed in the lateral plane. It was distinguished 
from heavenly bodies by its rapid change in relative position from 
the vertical to the horizontal. Also its abrupt change in course.

The only way I can describe the light from this object is by 
comparing it to the light of a house window at night, at a distance 
of thirty (30) yards and the yellowish glow it gives off. The 
object had a slightly darker color and a greater intensity than a 
house light as mentioned above.

The object did not light up the area beneath it, although it 
seemed to burn with an extremely intense dull light, nor did it 
light up the surrounding light haze. In watching this object I was 
unable to determine the size, the intensity and the size of the light 
did not change appreciably (note noticeable to me) during the entire 
time I watched its movement.

Although I had just come from a stag party at the Officer's Club, 
I was completely sober, having only one glass of beer during the entire 
evening. Because of this, I did not mention this experience until 
3 Mar 50, the night I saw strange happenings on the radar scopes 
(A/CPS-4 and A/CPS-5 Radar).

The second experience was as follows: I went on duty as Controller at 1630, 13 March 1950. At 1948 hours a blip was pointed out to me that was at 270°, sixty-eight (68) miles, 40,000 feet (measured by the HRI scope). (Capt. ____________ and I watched this blip and it did not move for three (3) minutes, then faded. At 2002 hours the target was picked up again and it was at 40,000 feet, lateral movement was detected in a northeasterly direction, at this time I estimated the speed at 1,500 m.p.h. At 2006 hours a target appeared at 350°, fifty-eight (58) miles at 45,000 feet. There were four (4) jet aircraft flying in the local area at this time at 24,000 feet and the altitude of the jet aircraft on a bearing of 340°, thirty-eight (38) miles, was checked at 25,000 feet on the HRI scope, the pilot stated that he was flying at 24,000 feet. This lends support of the accuracy of the HRI scope. The strange object faded after one minute. Captain ___________ and Lt ____________ came in and I left the radar scopes.

At 2020 hours I returned to the HRI scope to see an object at 350°, thirty-eight (38) miles climb from 30,000 feet to 45,000 feet in one (1) minute, with no lateral movement detected. I went off duty and left the GCI room at 2025 hours.

On the first occasion it was cloudless, moderately bright moonlight night, with a light haze; on the second occasion, it was clear with unrestricted visibility and no moon.

I am 27 years of age and have been a rated pilot in the USAF since October 1942, having over 2,900 hours flying time. I have had seven (7) months experience as a Radar Controller.

            ATTN: Counter Intelligence Division 

1. SYNOPSIS:  Lois L., Radar Operator and Controller, 661st AC & W Squadron, Selfridge Air Force Base, MichL, did on 9 March 1950 observe on radar scopes unexplained "Blips".   The "Blips" acted in a peculiar manner. It was assumed that the unidentified "Blips" were of an unconventional type aircraft. Observations of "Blips" also recorded by enlisted personnel on duty during the concerned period of time. 

2. DETAILS:   Lois I. was on duty with the 661st Radar Section on 9 March 1950 to control the positions of local Jet aircraft. Observations and control were normal until approximately 1915 hours, at which time, observed a blip on the radar scope at approximately 10,000 feet, range and azimuth holding steady at 270° at 25 miles. "Blips" was brilliant for a few seconds, then faded, and came back at a different location approximately five (5) minutes later. As this time other radar operators observed the "Blips" and questioned it. The estimated speed, which was not well founded but assumed to be about 1500 miles per hour, is a combination of vertical speed and horizontal speed based on various vectors derived from the instruments. The "Blip" per observed when picked up the second tims to move laterally to a bearing of 360* and was observed to be consistent for about three (3) minutes with the same scope.   __     during this period of time, did not record the information in a log however, his curiosity caused him to contact various jet fighters in this area to determine their altitude, bearing, and speed ---- could be used as a conclusive check on the radar scope.   _  than left the Radar Room and turned over controller work to

Pfrom the station in Zone 4 and in as close as 36 miles in Zone 4. Lt. 
_advised that on Friday, 3 March 1950, at approximately 23:5 
hours, after he had left a stag party in the Officer*s Club and having 
had only one beer during the course of the evening, he had observed a 
yellowish light in the sky . . 
cler from the Officers* Club in the direction of the PX on Selfridge 
Air Force Base. He blanked his cat’ down and observed the licht, its 
size and brifliancy,undarminad but described to be the approximate 
color and size of an electric light within a house showing through 'a
normal size window at a distance of about 50 to 75 feet on a dark 
night. The light was descending vertically over the Base and at 
first appeared to be a flare but, due to the color of the light, it 
was realized it could not have been a flare. He then stopped his 
car and observed the light further. The light then proceeded westward 
holding the same azimuth for approximately 10 to 15 miles . The light 
then went southward approximately the same distance, stopping and 
returning northward from the center line of sight the same distance 
giving the north-south movement approximately 80 to 100 miles. This 
occurred within four (A) minutes of time.
