REPORT. NUMBER OF OBJECT VISUALLY SIGHTED IS UNKNOWN. ELEVA-
TION OF FIRST OBJECT ON RADAR WAS APPROXIMATELY TEN DEGREES AND
AZIMUTH APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED NINETY DEGREES. LAST OBJECT
ON RADAR OBSERVED AT TWENTY DEGREES ELEVATION AND ONE HUNDRED
SEVENTY DEGREES AZIMUTH. THE FIRST OBJECT WAS VISUALLY OBSERVED
AT APPROXIMATELY TEN DEGREES IN ELEVATION AND APPROXIMATELY ONE
HUNDRED NINETY DEGREES IN AZIMUTH. WHEN LAST OBSERVED OBJECT AT
APPROXIMATELY TWENTY DEGREES ELEVATION AND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY
DEGREES AZIMUTH. FLIGHT PATTERNS WERE ERRATIC. RANGE WOULD CHANGE

FROM FOUR THOUSAND YARDS TO EIGHT THOUSAND YARDS AND AZIMUTH
FROM ONE HUNDRED NINETY DEGREES TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY DEGREES.
OBJECT SEEMED TO FADE FROM SCOPE AND VISUAL CONTACT WHEN FINALLY
LOST. THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE OBJECT ON SCOPE DURING THE THREE
HOUR PERIOD OF RADAR CONTACT. VISUAL CONTACT WAS DISRUPTED BY
INTERMITTANT FOG WHICH MOVED IN APPROXIMATELY ONE AND ONE HALF
HOURS AFTER THE INITIAL SIGHTING.

Registered in the sighting area also probably contributed to the visual sighting. -

The temperature inversion which probably produced the mirage was probably responsible for the targets on radar. The objects which were actually responsible for this sightings are uncontrolled due to a lack of information.

It is concluded that a temperature inversion with the associated mirage effects both visual and radar is the cause of this sighting.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Seattle, Washington

Date: 2 Oct 1959     Hour (Z) 08202

WX: Clear - fog moved in 1 1/2 hours after sighting.

Description: Five objects tracked on radar, several others not reported. Usually appeared in pairs. Round, size of quarter, white and blue with flickering light. Weak blip on radar. Faded after approximately three hours. Flight patterns were erratic.

Direction of Motion: Faded in area of observation.

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219)

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.):

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1):

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.):

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.:

Other: Probably Mirage

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably Good--

Analysis and Conclusions: THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THIS SIGHTING INDICATE THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING WAS A TEMPERATURE INVERSION WITH THE ASSOCIATED MIRAGE. THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN BY THE VISUAL WITNESSES AND RADAR WITNESSES WERE THE SAME THEREFORE IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT...
