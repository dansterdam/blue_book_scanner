FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 36-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

Jupiter through a Jet Trail

Venus, Mars, and Jupiter seen under unusual conditions can mystify even the most hardheaded witness. Unrecognized air turbulence and increased scattering of the light can easily create the illusion of a flying saucer.

An ex army man, a trained observer with a good knowledge of physics and optics reports the following unnerving experience [14].

"On January 9, 1954, my buddy and I had been fox hunting in southwestern Indiana. We hunted until well after sundown and headed for the car. As we neared it, a jet plane thundered through the dark. Placing game and guns in the car, I looked around it to see if the tires were OK. Happening to glance up, I let out a yell. There it was, and no mistaking it.

A flying saucer blazing in the sky. A real illuminated spaceship.

Only it was just hanging in the sky. Football-shaped, about us long as the apparent diameter of the full moon, it showed red, yellow, and bluish green. [Here he sketched a football shape, glowing red at the two ends, yellow lights gridding the middle, yellow and green arcs curving between the two ends (see Figure 10).] I carry an eight-power field glass when -

hunting and I immediately trained this on the celestial wonder. The
result was weird. It seemed to be pulsating with a quivering, twin-
kling light. We watched it for some five minutes, trying to figure
out what we were seeing. Then the spaceship began to get smaller,
simply reducing in size without moving. Smaller and smaller it be-
came and in another five minutes it suddenly contracted into a
planet—Jupiter, I believe it was. [Jupiter was in the eastern sky
some 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon.]

"When we realized what we were watching we began to try to
figure out the 'why.' Suddenly we realized we were looking directly
through the path of the plane at the planet and our best guess was
that the atmospheric turbulence and temperature change caused
by the passage of the jet was to blame for the strange alteration
we had witnessed. And we wondered if refraction of the golden
light could cause the reds, greens, and blues. Since neither of us
was able to take medicine in any form, we figured our observations
were about as substantial as our feeble scientific understanding
would permit.

"But anyway, I found out how people may see flying saucers and
be perfectly honest in their incomplete observations. Had a person
including the supernatural taken a good look, jumped in his car,
and had not gone home at high speed, would steadfastly have be-
lieved he had seen a flying saucer which was evidently observing
the earth preparatory to an attack from outer space."

NORTH PACIFIC
Second Officer B. M. Halmes of the American SS. Ultra, Capt.
A. P. LeCain, Master, reports the following observation:
On January 30, 1954, at 0904 G. M. T. in lat. 21°49' N., lon.
105°40' W., a brilliant meteor was observed. The body appeared
bearing 090° true at 15° elevation, disappeared on a bearing of
120° true at 5° elevation, and was visible for 4 seconds. The sky
was clear, with north by west, force 3, sea slight, air temperature
70° F., barometer 29.98 inches, ship's speed 16.0 knots. The
meteor was greenish-blue in color and twice as bright as the
planet Jupiter.

Many similar sightings have been reported, not only by astronomers, meteorologists and aerodynamicists, but good solid citizenry -- men of reputation and with keen eye sight. Typical is the report in Feb. 1954 by Northwest Airline pilots enroute from Seattle to Anchorage. They reported to the Air Force Intelligence having witnessed a strange object which flew alongside their ship, its porthole exuding a bright light. The pilots tried several times to close the gap between their ship and the object, but failed. They said the vehicle was "definitely under power's(sic) control."
