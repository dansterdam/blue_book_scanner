This page contains a photograph depicting an illustration of what appears to be a UFO or "flying saucer" seen through a jet trail. The illustration shows a spherical or dome-shaped object with alternating light and dark bands or sections. The text accompanying the image provides a description of the visual experience of observers seeing Venus, Mars, and Jupiter under unusual conditions, which could create the illusion of a "flying saucer".

Jupiter through a Jet Trail
Venus, Mars, and Jupiter seen under unusual conditions can modify the most hard-headed witness. Unrecognized air turbulence and increased scattering of the light can easily create the illusion of a flying saucer.
An expert man, a trained observer with a good knowledge of physics, reports the following unnerving experience [...]
On January 2, 1954, my buddy and I had been fox hunting in southwest Indiana. We hunted until well after sundown and were returning home in the dark. As we neared it, a jet plane thundered through the sky not far north of south. Placing some green and yellow eyes in the dark, the car sped on. Just as I started to glance away, I caught a yell. There it was, and no mistaking it. A flying saucer, standing still in the sky. A real illuminated spacecraft.
Only it wasn't moving, just hanging in the sky. Football-shaped, about as large as the apparent diameter of the full moon, it showed red, yellow, and bush green. [Here is sketched a football-shaped, brightly colored object.]

hunting and I immediately trained this on the celestial wonder. The result was not what we expected to be pulsating with a strange, irregular dimness and brilliant core blinding us five minutes, trying to figure out what we were seeing. Then the spaceship began to get smaller, simply assuming a size without moving. Smaller and smaller it became and in another five minutes it suddenly contracted into a planet. I believe it was Jupiter in the eastern sky.

When we studied what we were watching we began to try to figure out the evidence by which we determined the thing through id-field-glasses, and our best guess was that some of the planets of the solar system and their constant disturbance and temperature change caused by the passage of the jet was to blame for the strange aberration we had just witnessed. And we wondered if refraction of the golden light could cause the reds, greens, and blues. Since neither of us were in any form, we figured our observations were about as substantial as our feeble scientific understanding would.

It would seem a strange thing for most people may see flying saucers and be pro- but in their incomplete observations. Had a person with a supernatual takenantoafgoodlook, jumped in his car, and raced off at high speed, he would steadfastly have believed he had seen a flying saucer which was evidently observing the earth's preparatory to an attack from outer space.

NORTH PACIFIC
Second Officer B. M. Helms of the American SS. UFO, Capt. A. F. LeCain, Master, reports the following observation:
On January 30, 1954, at 0930 G.M.T. in lat. 51*55' N., long. 176*06' W., a greenish-blue circular object, resembling the planet Jupiter, on a bearing of 000* true at 15* elevation, disappeared on a bearing of 120* true in 4 seconds. The object was visible for 4 seconds. The time was 0930 G.M.T.
The object was greenish-blue in color and twice as bright as the planet Jupiter.

INFORMATION ONLY (NO CASE)
Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 8 June 1954 
February 1954
Flight Between Seatchkean-Anchortge

Many similar sightings have been reported, not only by air controllers, meteorologists, passengers and aircraft pilots. They apparently are becoming more frequent. On the above date an Air Liner pilot enroute from Kodiak to Anchorage reported the same type of sighting. They reported a bright light object which they lost behind their aircraft. Its portholes extruding a "bluish-green" light. The light seemed to close the gap between their ship and the object, then it failed. They said the vehicle was "definitely unidentified."
