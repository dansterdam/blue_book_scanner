1. The inclosed correspondence was forwarded to this headquarters by Captain Berkov, Director of Intelligence, Headquarters Command, Bolling Air Force Base, but was not received in Headquarters USAF until 11 April 1952. The delay in receipt of reports was caused by a misunderstanding concerning the proper method for handling this type of information.

SUBJECT: Aerial Sighting of Unidentified Object

       Directorate of Intelligence
       Headquarters Command
       Bolling Air Force Base
       Washington, D. C.

1. On Monday, 10 September 1951, I departed Andrews AFB at 1830 hours in C-47/A 45-9184, accompanied by Capt. Headquarters, Air Resupply & Communications Service, who was serving as co-pilot.

2. Flight plan was four (4) hour local for the purpose of accomplishing 60-2 requirements.

3. During the period the weather in the Washington, Baltimore, Quantico area was ceiling unlimited, visibility 15 plus, with bright moonlight.

4. At 2200 hours, while proceeding from Baltimore toward the Andrews range at an altitude of 5,500 feet, my attention was drawn to a streak of light approaching from right and proceeding on an angular course across my flight path. The track made good by the object appeared to be in the neighborhood of 70 to 90째. The object remained in sight for approximately 5 to 10 seconds at what appeared to be the same altitude at which I was flying, during which period Capt. _______ and I discussed the object. When last seen the light was proceeding slightly north of Millersville and while at first glance it appeared to be on the declining half of a trajectory, a 1/10 cloud coverage at an altitude of approximately 350 feet over Millersville prevented positive determination that the object had descended to the ground.

5. When first seen, the object appeared as a streak of blue flame approximately 100 feet in length with the color of the flame changing to white as it came. I was unable to determine the object proceeding the flame since a combination of the moonlight and light from the flame itself blurred background targets. The speed at which the object was flying was estimated to be about 500 miles per hour, and while the mass of the object could not be distinguished it definitely had mass and shape.

Hq ABS Subject: Aerial Sighting of Unidentified Object 12 Sep 1951

a. After landing at Andrews at approximately 2230 hours, this information was given to the Officer of the Day. No attempt was made at that time to desire the sighting and I am unaware even at the present time as to what it may have been. I have seen jet aircraft at night and am experienced in the operating field where flares have been used extensively. This object could not be placed in either category.

12 September 1951

SUBJECT: Unusual Sighting

To:   Director of Intelligence
       Headquarters Command
       Bolling Air Force Base
       Washington 25, D.C.

On Monday night, 10 September 1951, I was flying as co-pilot in a C-47 on a local flight from Andrews Air Force Base. At approximately 10 o'clock I would estimate our position was 10 miles northwest of Andrews at 5000' on a course at 230째.

At this time I noticed a light in the sky directly in front of us at approximately 5000' altitude, 30 miles southeast of Andrews, apparently on a course somewhere between 60째 and 90째. The light grew in intensity and magnitude and seemed to be white-hot. I would estimate that with apparent exhaust was traveling in excess of 500 miles per hour. The total time that I observed this light was in the neighborhood of 5 seconds. When the light disappeared nothing else could be seen, there were no running lights or no outline of any object visible.

I would estimate the trajectory was either parallel to the ground or slightly downward. I have never before encountered anything of this nature and it was my impression that it looked like the exhaust from a rocket.
