1. The inclosed correspondence was forwarded to this headquarters by Captain Berkow, Director of Intelligence, Headquarters Command, U.S. Air Force, but was not received in Headquarters USAF until 11 April 1952. The delay in receipt of these reports was caused by a misunderstanding concerning the proper method for handling this type of information.

2. Captain Berkow has been informed of the proper procedure for handling such reports.  

3. Enclosures are forwarded for information and retention.

SUBJECT: Aerial Sighting of Unidentified Object

Bolling Air Force Base
Washington, D. C.

1. On Monday, 10 September 1951, I departed Andrews AFB at 1830 hours in C-47A 45-918, accompanied by Capt. ______ Headquarters, Air Resupply & Communications Service, who was serving as co-pilot.

2. Flight plan was four (4) hour local for the purpose of accomplishing 60-2 requirements.

3. During the period the weather in the Washington, Baltimore, Quantico area was ceiling unlimited; visibility 15 plus, with bright moonlight.

4. At 2200 hours, while proceeding from Baltimore toward the Andrews Range at an altitude of 5500 feet, my attention was drawn to a streak of light approaching from the right and proceeding on an angular course across my flight path. The track made good for the bright streak was SE to NW. I remained in sight for approximately 5 to 10 seconds at what appeared to be the same altitude at which I was flying, during which period Capt. ______ and I discussed the object. When last seen the light was proceeding on a slightly northerly track and while at first glance it appeared to be on the declining half of a trajectory, a l/10 cloud coverage at that time made determination almost impossible. I estimate that the object had descended to the ground.

5. When first seen, the object appeared as a streak of blue flame approximately 100 feet in length with the color of the flame changing to white at the end. It was unable to determine the object preceding the flame which appeared to consume it. An illumination from the object following the flame trail which the object was leaving resulted in the observer's statement that the object was flying was estimated to be about 500 miles per hour. And while the mass of the object could not be distinguished it definitely had mass and shape.

UNCLASSIFIED
HQ ARS Subject: Aerial Sighting of Unidentified Objects 12 Sep 1951
After landing at Andrews at approximately 2230 hours, this information was given to the Officer of the Day. No attempt was made at that time to describe the sighting and I am unaware even at the present time as to what it may have been. I have seen jet aircraft at night and other objects used extensively. This object could not be placed in either category.

HEADQUARTERS
AIR RESUPPLY AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

12 September 1951

SUBJECT: Unusual Sighting

TO: Director of Intelligence
Headquarters, United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

On Monday night, 10 September 1951, I was flying as co-pilot in a C-47 on a local flight from Andrews Air Force Base. At approximately 10 o'clock I would estimate our position was 10 miles northeast of Andrews at 6000' on a course of 230Â°.

At this time I saw an object ahead of us at approximately 8000' altitude, 30 miles southeast of Andrews, apparently traveling in excess of 600 and 900 miles per hour. The light was of great intensity and magnitude and seemed to be white-hot. I would estimate its speed to be in excess of 500 miles per hour. The total time that I observed this light was in the neighborhood of 2 seconds. When the light disappeared, there were no trailing lights or no outline of any object visible.

I would estimate the trajectory was either parallel to the group of slightly downward. I have never before encountered anything which would lead me to believe the exhaust from a rocket.

Captain, USAF
