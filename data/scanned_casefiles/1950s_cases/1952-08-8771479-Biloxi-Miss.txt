[DECLASSIFIED]

STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, authorized to administer oaths in cases of this nature, etc., in Biloxi, Mississippi, and upon being duly sworn according to law, made the following voluntary sworn statement:

"At approximately fourteen (14), 26 August 1952, I, stationed at Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi, the observer, sighted an unidentified flying object in the sky near Southeast of my home base. The object appeared to be round and flat in shape and reddish-brown in color. Observing as a trained radar operator, I could not accurately determine the size of the object but a rough estimate would be somewhere around nine (9) feet by eleven (11) feet.

"The object was following an East Southeast course and would move from the course to the right, move back on course, and then move to the left. (2) observed the object approximately 15 to 20 miles from my location, traveling at a fairly high rate of speed. I observed two (2) trails, similar to the trails of jets seen at night, coming from each end of the object, making forward progress at a rapid rate of speed. I could hear no sound coming from the object and observed no aerodynamic features.

"From the time I first saw the object until sunrise, I took twenty-three (23) pictures of the object. Upon development of the film, however, all pictures were underexposed."

Biloxi, Mississippi

Subscribed and sworn to before me this, the twenty-ninth (29th) day of August 1952, at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi.

1. At approximately 1015*, 25 August 1952, the observer, a civilian, while sitting in the west end of the approximately 1,015 x 2,000 ft. Keesler AFB runway, observed an unidentified object in the approximate geographical position of 290°/4,800'31". The object was described as being toward west and rise in shape and seemed to move in color. It was stationary at first and then moved from approximately nine (9) miles by Wilson (15) west to within two (2) miles of the observer. The object was round, white, and appeared to be about the size of a (2) miles. Altitude similar to that of high-flying aircraft. The object was located in a cloudless area of the sky.

2. The period of observation was established as being approximately (75) minutes. During which time, twenty-five persons, including the observer, saw the object. Upon development, however, the sills was discovered to have been unintentional.
