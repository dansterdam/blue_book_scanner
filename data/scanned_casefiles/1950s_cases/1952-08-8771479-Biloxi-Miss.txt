STATEMENT

Voluntarily appeared before me, the undersigned, certain information regarding an incident which occurred in the vicinity of Biloxi, Miss, on the evening of 25 August 1952.

On the above date, at approximately 7:15 PM, I was standing in my back yard at Biloxi, Miss, when I noticed a bright light in the sky approximately 35 degrees above the horizon to the southwest of my location. This light was brilliantly illuminated and appeared to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. As I continued to observe the object, it began to move in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. The object then stopped, hovered for a period of approximately 30 seconds, and then accelerated in a westerly direction at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The entire observation lasted approximately 45 seconds. The object did not appear to be an airplane, meteor, or any other known type of aerial vehicle, nor was there any sound associated with its movement. I have had considerable experience in observing aircraft and I am absolutely certain that the object I observed was not a conventional type of aircraft. 

I hope the above statement is of assistance in your investigation of this incident. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Respectfully,
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED], Biloxi, Miss.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DATE OF INFORMATION: 8 AUGUST 1952
LOCATION: BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI
DETAILS: Witness reported observing an unidentified flying object on the night of 8 August 1952. The object was described as circular in shape, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright light. It was observed for approximately 20 minutes, moving at a high rate of speed, before disappearing.
EVALUATION: The object could not be identified as any known type of aircraft. No further information is available.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The document is an "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" and contains detailed textual information about a reported UFO sighting, including the location, date, description of the object, and other details.

The text in the document is as follows:

REPORT
1. The object was first observed by witness(es) at approximately  1700 hours, 18 August 1952, in the vicinity of Biloxi, Mississippi.
2. The object had a flaming white light surrounding the center, which appeared to be the shape of a flying saucer, and was observed for approximately 30 minutes.
3. The object was observed by several witnesses to be hovering and then flying at a high rate of speed.
4. DETAILS:
a. No.
b. PHENOMENA
c. OBSERVATIONS
d. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: The witnesses are considered to be reliable and their observations are considered to be potentially valid.
e. SIZE OF OBJECT: Approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter.
f. COURSE FOLLOWED BY OBJECT: The object was observed to be hovering and then flying at a high rate of speed.
g. SPEED OF OBJECT: Estimated to be in excess of 1000 mph.
h. MANNER OF OBSERVATION: Visual observation.
i. COMMENTS:
A tentative conclusion is that the object observed may have been a "flying saucer," as the description fits that of a typical "flying saucer" sighting. However, the high speed of the object, in excess of 1000 mph, is considered to be beyond the capabilities of current aircraft. Further investigation is required to determine the exact nature of the object.

ON 26 AUGUST 1952, AT APPROXIMATELY 1920 HOURS, A FORMATION OF BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED IN THE SKY BY NUMEROUS PERSONS IN THE BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI AREA. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO BE FLYING IN AN EAST TO WEST DIRECTION AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES AND WERE VISIBLE TO PERSONS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE BILOXI AREA. OBSERVERS WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT NUMBER OF OBJECTS IN THE FORMATION AS THEY APPEARED TO BE IN CONTINUOUS MOTION. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO MAKE SUDDEN AND ERRATIC TURNS AND CHANGES IN ALTITUDE. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECTS. WHILE THE EXACT ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECTS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED, THEY APPEARED TO BE FLYING WELL ABOVE 10,000 FEET.

A/S COMMENTED: THIS REPORT IS ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE ONE RECEIVED ON 26 AUGUST 1952, CONCERNING A FORMATION OF BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS OBSERVED OVER THE BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI AREA. ACCORDING TO INFORMATION RECEIVED, THESE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED BY NUMEROUS PERSONS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE BILOXI AREA, AND APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IN AN EAST TO WEST DIRECTION. THE OBSERVERS WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT NUMBER OF OBJECTS IN THE FORMATION AS THEY WERE IN CONTINUOUS MOTION, AND WERE OBSERVED TO MAKE SUDDEN AND ERRATIC TURNS AND CHANGES IN ALTITUDE. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECTS, WHICH APPEARED TO BE FLYING WELL ABOVE 10,000 FEET. THE DETAILS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT ARE ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THOSE REPORTED PREVIOUSLY.
