On the night of Friday, February 11, 1955, Miss [redacted] and I were walking across the Western
State College Campus on our way to a dance hall at the Student Union Building. As we were walking, for
the dance we decided to wait for awhile in some other place between our library and what is known as
Cherry Hall. I had not yet known when I first sighted an orange colored object in the sky. From where I
was standing, the object appeared in a southeastern direction. I would say the time when I first saw it
became I thought it might be far from a long distant point. It was approximately 200 feet high. The object
had a fairly good visibility about it. After calling

While in attention to the object we watched
it for several minutes. While in the air the fight
flogged around some time, the normal figure eights, and
would suddenly go out while moving forward. It would
the object to large, slowly out of safe bay, move then
and then on with occasional to-night drags, almost
anyone of the object would be unable rise rapidly
and soon disappear. The object would be fairly quickly
until they slated to rise, they would then disappear
in seconds.

We watched the object appears, disappears, and reappears
on the same aerial line when nine sighted a
group of six or eight objects going out, in a northeast
direction. The objects spread to the thin an uncompleted
V-formation. There were two objects side by side company
on side. The following is a period sketch of the flight:

of the sighting the sky for a few minutes, then
the objects appeared in side direction and spread
to by flight each other. They definitely were being
controlled from some sort. The group were very smooth
and tight.

These object would disappearing one at a time, but for a few minutes there was always one object in the sky. The object usually disappearing in a few seconds direction.

The night of Feb. 18 was a very warm, starlight one. Vision was unlimited so it was impossible to mistake the altitude of the object. We continued watching the object until 19:50 hrs., at which time the object was still in the sky.
