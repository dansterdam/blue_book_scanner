UNCLASSIFIED

Three objects approximately the size of a white Navy flare moving without sound or exhaust trail at an approximate altitude of 5,000 feet at a speed greater than any plane ever observed by him.

a. Being on land, first object was white, with second object half the size of the first object, and the third object being half the size of the second object. By the case of an automobile three white lights, the largest of which was about the size of a jet plane, without sound or smoke.

[Several lines are blacked out]

b. Formation: [blacked out] objects appeared to be moving in a triangular formation. [blacked out] gave no estimate to the altitude between the objects, although he stated they seemed to be much higher. The formation did not change during the maneuvers described in succeeding paragraphs. [blacked out] objects appeared to be moving in a formation directly behind each other. [blacked out] distance between the lights. The formation did not change during the maneuvers described in succeeding paragraphs. By [blacked out] this observer's description of the formation corrected.

c. Maneuvers: All three (3) observers stated that they first observed the lights to the north of the observation point, and that the lights moved in a direct course from north to south over the northwest runway of Westover #3, Mass. First observer estimated first observation to be approximately five (5) degrees above the horizon, and that they disappeared approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. He stated that the formation seemed to be climbing toward the part which he had under observation.

d. Manner of Disappearance: All observers stated that the lights disappeared suddenly at the same time, apparently going behind a cloud bank in the southwest skies.

e. Time Sighted: All observers stated that the approximate time of sighting was 10:45 hours, 5 August 1952 and that the total time of observation was from two (2) to five (5) seconds.

f. Manner and Location of Observations No optical or mechanical aids were employed. All observers were standing in the parking area near the 1000 ft. transient headquarters, a location approximately in the center of Westover #3, Mass. [blacked out] noticed the objects first and called [blacked out] attention to them.

a. Identifying information on Observers:

[Details about an observer from Philadelphia High School, assigned as a Form 5 Clerk in the 15th Air Transport Group, with approximately 30 hours flying time]

Weather Conditions: All observers described the sky as clear to the north, with estimated ceiling a low portion of the sky. Weather conditions at 0025 EST, 5 August 1952, were reported by the Weather Service, Stewart AFB, Mass., as follows: Ceiling 1200 to 2100 broken, visibility 7 miles, wind south at 10 knots.

1. Sighting Conditions that might account for sightings: None however, reports showed the Goodyear blimp was in the vicinity, Comtop Squadron, Stewart AFB, Mass., and reflected that there was no jet activity over Stewart AFB, Mass., at the time of alleged sightings. No other evidence connected with this sighting could be established.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Country: Singapore, B.C.C.
Date of Report: 9 August 1952
Date of Incident: 3 August 1952
Prepared by: Kirkwood C. Myers, Captain, USAF, A/Airlo
From: Air Liaison Office, Singapore, B.C.C.
Source: Singapore Standard Newspaper

1. The following article appeared in the Singapore Standard Newspaper on 3 August 1952.

UNUSUAL SEEN OVER PENANG

Penang, (S.P.)- Several residents in Tanjong Tokong, believed that they saw the flying saucer travelling at a great speed from the direction of the sea towards the land twice last night.

At 7:40 p.m., they first saw a very bright round "object" travelling from the sea towards the land. About two hours later, another similar object was seen speeding in the same direction.

One Chinese resident said today that the "object" travelled at a terrific speed without any noise. Then it was very high up in the sky, like that of a moon, but it was very high up in the sky.

"Suddenly, it disappeared before I could look at it carefully", he said.

Last Thursday evening, excitement was also caused in Ayer Itam when villagers there noticed a bright "massive" speeding across the sky.

The object was said to have radiated a bright greenish light and disappeared behind the hills near Bukit Tentera.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM 4670th Flying Training Wing    REPORT NO. IR-33-2
Pinecaetlo Air Force Base         PAGE 2 of 2 PAGES
Orlando, Florida

Between 0700 and 1000 hours 5 August 1952, an unidentified object was
observed over Orlando, Florida, by Roosevelt Park, Orlando, Florida.

The object appeared to be a solid silver ball, with no audible sound
or visible exhaust. The diameter of the object was estimated to be slightly
less than the length of B-33 type aircraft.

The object was first observed at 0700, hovering at an estimated 5000
feet altitude. Object was in sight approximately ten minutes when it flew
east towards the main section of Orlando at a very high rate of speed, and
disappeared. This was repeated several times in the next three hours,
with duration of sightings ranging from three to ten minutes.

At each sighting the object appeared to hover, with little or no lateral
or vertical movement, and then leave the area at a very high rate of speed.

Just prior to acceleration the object appeared to glow, as though from
intense heat.

At 0930 hours 5 August 1952, the object was observed by Orlando, Fla. These
observers were a top of the USAF missile team when they encountered an object
hovering above the city. Description and identification of the object was identical to that as described by previous and subsequent sightings.

At the time of sighting visibility was unlimited, with 7/10 coverage
of cumulus clouds.

No interception was made and no photographs were taken.

The observers have had no previous experience in aircraft observation.

Aircraft from this base were flying in the vicinity during period of
observation, but no report of unidentified objects were received from the
base, or nearby Naval Air Station or McDill Air Force Base, Patrick Air Force
Base, were reported in this area during time of observation.
