APPENDIX IV
Korea - 24 February 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On the night of 24 February 1952, at 2315 local Korean time, the navigator B-29 observed an unidentified aerial object. The B-29 was picked up by searchlights and about 45 seconds later the navigator sighted an object approaching from 7 o'clock. The object was estimated to be over Antung this time. The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape and had a rapidly pulsating gaseous type of exhaust trail. The exhaust trail was approximately three times the length of the object with both the tail blast and the object bluish in color.

When first observed the object appeared to be climbing at 45°, however, it leveled off approximately 4,000 ft. from the B-29 and turned toward the B-29 as if taking up an interceptor course. The object continued to close on the B-29 at high velocity for approximately 15 seconds after which time it broke off level flight and headed down, passing under the B-29 at a great angle. As the object began to descend the flare diminished in size and got brighter. The navigator estimated that the object came within 3000 ft. of the aircraft and "it appeared to be the size of an automobile". (Assumed to mean the same size as an automobile viewed from 3,000 ft.)

The B-29 was flying at 22,000 ft. altitude and at a speed of 200 knots.

The searchlights stayed with the aircraft for approximately four minutes and weak inaccurate flak was encountered during the entire incident.

Weak electronic signals were picked up by the electronic counter-measures operator for a short time.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

More details on the sighting have been requested from FEAF. Since the object resembles a surface-to-air guided missile, the incident has been referred to the ATIC guided missiles group.

Mr. C.F. Zimmerman, ATIA

Reference Telecon from CG FSAF JAPTC-238 dated 26 February 1952, re sighting of object on night of 24 February 1952. Based on performance deduced from the reported information, object appears to be a subsonic surface-to-air guided missile, possibly of the German Schmetterling type. Current estimates credit the Soviets with the capability of having an operational surface-to-air guided missile of this type now, although until this time there has been no intelligence on which to credit the Soviets with more than a capability. A more complete evaluation of this sighting will be made upon receipt of complete information from FSAF.

At 2315I, a B-29 on leaflet mission at XB 2858 heading 030°, altitude 25,000 ft. was picked up in searchlight beam by two lights on right side of act. Within 15 seconds after first visual contact by searchlight, individual object was seen approaching; acft position on ground estimated to be at XB 2342. No launching blast was observed and object appeared to approach act. at an angle of 300 from the last haze. Then observer initially spotted object, it appeared to be round in shape and bright blue in color. At it came closer to the acft, the forward mass of objects indicated with tail approximately three times length of the forward mass of objects. The color of the tail was the same as object and appeared to be a rapidly pulsating gaseous type propulsion blast. Observer saw object for an estimated 45 seconds. The course of the object was at an angle of 45° from horizontal, of 150 velocity, last in trajectory until it leveled off approximately 4000 ft. For acft, it was normal flight altitude, turned to the left as though making a correction to intercept acft at a predicted point. The object continued to close in toward interception point on level with acft for about 15 seconds and then broke off in flight and head down and underneath. acft at gradual angle. At the closest point, the object appeared to come within approximately 300 ft. of acft and appeared to be in size of matchbox, an 1/8 inch thick, off-white in color. The indicated air speed of acft was 250 knots and acft remained at 22,000 ft. altitude. Searchlights continued to illuminate acft and navigators, inaccurate flak was encountered during entire period. Capt and navigator were working on charts, reduced to four flight pictures, and kept ship illuminated for approximately four minutes. Comments of interrogating officer indicate searchlight tracking was excellent. Pilot executed evasion action in a series of "S" curves, then made a standard dive and searchlights and flak ceased. Weather was clear and visibility unlimited.

Navigator who observed object is experienced. Served in WW II, holds grade of Captain and has flown 15 combat missions over North Korea. Has never observed object previously and is of the opinion that he saw a rocket. His is positive that object was not searchlight projected or controlled. In his manner of expression, the air crew who reported observing anything unusual, he is considered extremely reliable and rational.

Comments of Interrogating Officer: Bright blue flame suggests possibility of alcohol and liquid oxygen fuel. Changes in course of flight, or possible indication of electronic guiding device.
