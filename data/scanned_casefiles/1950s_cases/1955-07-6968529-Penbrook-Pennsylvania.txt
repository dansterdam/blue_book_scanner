The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and another curved line labeled "B" to illustrate how high the observed object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen and when it was last seen. 

The second sketch contains two larger drawings. The drawing on the left shows a landscape with buildings and mountains in the background, and a person standing in the foreground. The drawing on the right shows a more abstract landscape with a curved horizon line.

Based on the instructions provided, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

42. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7-6-55

I have served as Chief Observer of a Civilian Defense Aircraft Observation Post in Penbrook, Pa. from 1943 to 1955. During this time there were many aircraft reported by other observers. The object I observed became a separate problem to investigate. It did not become lost in the many other aircraft I have observed over the years. The speeds, directions of flight, and altitudes were not the normal air traffic that I am used to seeing. This object was highly maneuverable, alternating between hovering and rapid motion. The light of the object was highly intense and brillant, but not the steady glow of any known aircraft. The color was a brilliant white with some blue-green around the edges. The observations lasted several minutes and the object finally disappeared very rapidly. The experience left me quite shaken and disturbed by what I had witnessed, as this was no normal aircraft.

This occurrence lasted for this duration is similar to numerous "sightings" we have had of the same type of falling objects. There is no special or distinctive feature about it. It descended rapidly slowly from almost overhead to the horizon. The appearance of these objects are flat as a sheet of paper, or like metal heating circles to balloon a well corroded. Their movement is in straight direction as no zig-zag or change in course. Their color varies from silver, gold, black, green, blue, reflecting same as sunlight from above. Their sighting may vary from a few seconds to a few minutes.

CONTENTS:
I.  SUMMARY: Unidentified Flying Objects were sighted by Mrs. EDWARD SUPE in the Penbrooke, Pennsylvania (COPY BLDS) area on 13 July 1955. 
AS directed by Headquarters 4602d AISS per telephone conversation, 13 July 1955, the preliminary investigation was conducted. Mrs. SUPE was contacted and questioned regarding her reliability on 13 July 1955. It was established that she has no record of previous UFOB sightings and that she was supervisor of the 648th AC&W Squadron, which made all of the preliminary UFOB reports in the area. She stated that she would be willing to cooperate in any further investigation regarding SOUR AND WITH ascertainlists.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FIGHT 3R, 46024 AIRS
I. SOURCE: Anne Chamberlin (Mrs.)
Address: 2740 Ludwig Street, Penbrook, Pennsylvania
AGE: 42
Occupation: Housewife
Qualifications: Received 600 hours (4$ years), auxiliary police-woman during war.
II. INVESTIGATION: Viewed concerning her sightings of UFOB's to determine her reliability. Mrs. Chamberlin stated that she was to determine the time and duration of the sightings and described them as round, glowing objects about 50-60 feet in diameter. She stated further that she is an observer of the Ground Observer Corps and that the objects she has observed resembled the fighting lights as those sometimes seen in high altitude flights. She stated that she had been alone when observations were made but that other observers during periods of observation could not apparently confirm her observations. During entire conversations Mrs. Chamberlin was calm and cooperative and described objects to be of metal type, emitting multi-colored lights, and circular in shape. SUBJECT continued to emphasize her desire to be cooperative and of her patriotic desire to assist in the Air Force operations as a SOURCË continued to emphasize her desire to be cooperative and of her patriotic desire to assist in the Air Force operations as a member of the Ground Observer Corps and because of these factors and lack of technical background.
2/33: Arthur J. Brays, AF 19 387 462, Det. 4, 6670th AISS, Harrisburg, Pa. was telephonically interviewed and stated that he is USAF supervisor of Mrs. Chamberlin and believes Mrs. Chamberlin to be sincere, however she observed very few sightings and these were occasional and brief. It was therefore 2g Brays' opinion that Mrs. Chamberlin's reliability as an observer would be rated as poor and that she was never able to observe or verify such sightings. It was therefore 2/Lt Brays' opinion that the reliability of Mrs. Chamberlin in these matters would be rated as poor.
