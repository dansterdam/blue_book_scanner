This occurrence listed in this questionnaire is similar to numerous "sighting" we have had of the same type of falling objects. There is no special or set time of the day or place in the sky for these objects must be seen as "true" or no round to form.

The appearance of these objects are off as a sheet of paper or thin metal heavy enough to follow a set course or direction as no breeze or study wind changes their course. Their description may be round, square, oblong, leg shaped, rectangle on any shape - hanging in air from height 2 inches to 14 size of newspaper, also they may range in colors from silver gold, black gray, green, blue, yellow & khaki. There has been a couple of observations where these objects burst into flames close to or contact with the ground at little lake near...

SUMMARY:

I. CONTENTS:
PART ONE: Reliability of Mrs [redacted], Penbrook, Pennsylvania, (GUPL 1118)

II. SUMMARY: Unidentified Flying Objects were sighted by Mrs [redacted] at Harrisburg, Pa, on 12 July 1955 as well as on previous occasions. As directed by Headquarters 4602d AISS per telephone conversation, 13 July 1955, a telephonic investigation was conducted by Flight 3P to determine reliability of SOURCE. SOURCE was interviewed by telephone on 13 July 1955 and her immediate USAF supervisor was contacted and questioned regarding her reliability on 15 July 1955. This reliability report is a result of interviews with SOURCE and her immediate USAF supervisor. The Commanding Officer of the 648th AC&W Squadron, which made all of the preliminary UFOB reports in these cases, and the chief who had conducted the preliminary investigation were contacted but neither could give any information regarding SOURCE's reliability.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Flight 2F, 4602d AISS                REPORT NO.                   PART ONE
                                                                         PAGE    1   OF   1   PAGES

I. SOURCE:   Anne Chamberlin (Mrs)
    Address: 2740 Ludwig Street, Penbrook, Pennsylvania
    Age:     42
    Occupation: Housewife
    Qualifications: GOC Observer for past four and one half (4½) years, auxiliarly policeman during war.

II. RELIABILITY: On 13 July 1955 Mrs Anne Chamberlin, was telephonically interviewed concerning her sightings of UFO's to determine her reliability. Mrs Chamberlin advised that she was 12 years at age, that her sole occupation was that of housewife, and that she possessed no technical education or experience along those lines. She stated further that she is an observer for the Ground Observer Corps, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and that she has observed similar sightings as these she reported over a period of 4½ years, since operation "Skywatch" began. She stated that she had been alone when observations were made but that other observers during periods of duty had reported similar observations. Mrs Chamberlin could not specifically describe these and alternate verbal descriptions, such as lines, paper and/or cardboard of silver color with yellow centers. During entire conversation Mrs Chamberlin was unable to be specific concerning observations and described objects differently each time. It was difficult to maintain conversation on this topic alone as source continued to emphasize her desire to be cooperative and of her patriotic regard of duty at present and of her efforts during the war as an auxiliary policewoman. Based on above, it appeared that Mrs Chamberlin was over-zealous in her desire to be of service, and because of these factors and lack of technical background, reliability of SOURCE is rated as poor.

S/Sgt Arthur F Bray, AF 19 387 463, Det 4, 4670th GOC, Harrisburg, Pa was telephonically interviewed and advised that he is USAF supervisor of Mrs Chamberlin and described her as tending to be somewhat eccentric. Sgt Bray stated further that he believed Mrs Chamberlin to be sincere, however she was overly cooperative and often exaggerated. Sgt Bray stated that she has made such observations over a long period of time and that he has expended a great amount of time at Mrs Chamberlin's post but was never able to observe or verify such sightings. It was therefore Sgt Bray's opinion that reliability of Mrs Chamberlin in those matters would be rated as poor.
