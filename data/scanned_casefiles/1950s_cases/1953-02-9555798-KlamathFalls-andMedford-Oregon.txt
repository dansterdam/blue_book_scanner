I.    Description of Incident

At 2159 PST a round red stationary object was sighted by a CAA operator for 10 minutes time. The object seemed to fade in and fade out intermittently and eventually faded out completely. The observer estimated the unknown to be at a 270° azimuth from his position and at an altitude of 10,000'. Weather at the time of sighting consisted of scattered clouds at 2,000' with 10 miles visibility.

II.   Discussion of Incident

Project Blue Book and its contract astronomer evaluate this report as definitely caused by the astronomical body Venus. Many similar reports have been received by ATIC during February of an object in the western sky appearing to change color and fading intermittently, and almost all such reports have been found to be Venus.

It is interesting to note in this and other similar observations that experienced CAA and Air Force personnel have been understandably confused by this bright planet, comparatively isolated, low on the horizon and sometimes seen through a high haze layer causing a rapid change in color. Red is the color given most often.

III.  Conclusion

Was Venus.
