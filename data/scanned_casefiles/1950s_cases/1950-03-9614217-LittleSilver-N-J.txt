The text on this page is very faint and partially illegible. I can make out some words and fragments, but cannot confidently transcribe the entire text. The visible text appears to be handwritten and is located at the bottom of the document. There are also two hole punches visible on the left side of the page. The top and middle of the page are mostly blank with a light gray background.


- page 3 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a blank or nearly blank document page with hole punches on the left side, typical of a file or report document from the 1950s. The page is grayscale and appears to have some very faint marks or smudges, but no readable text is present.


- page 4 -

The image appears to be a very low-quality, grainy black and white document with significant degradation and noise. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor image quality. There are two circular holes punched at the top of the document, likely for filing purposes. The text on the page is too blurry and distorted to be accurately transcribed.

MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE:

1. On 23 March 1950, at approximately 1000 hours, Andrew J. Reid, Civilian Intelligence Officer, Security & Intelligence Division, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, interviewed Mrs. Lewis Prentiss, at her residence, Clover Lane, Rumson, N. J., in the presence of Virginia McNally, Secretary, and the son of Mrs. Lewis Prentiss.

Mrs. [redacted] stated that she was riding in her car on Ridge Road, Fair Haven, N. J., on 15 March 1950, shortly after 1730 hours, to meet her husband at the Little Silver railroad station. She noticed three perpendicular objects with vaporous lines in the sky. At first she thought it was sky-writing and seeing no plane she thought possibly it could be a queer formation of clouds. A car passed her, in which two men were riding, and she noticed their interest in the same object. This car stopped a short distance from her and she noted the license number "NJ 14 E New Jersey."

She continued to watch the phenomena in the sky, which she described as three port holes with lights behind them, or lights that might be viewed through a fog. The weather was very clear and early evening daylight. Around these three luminous round forms there seemed to be a density of 'sky-blue' colored gas. The objects were not disc-like in form.

She further stated that she could not estimate the height or speed, as she had no conception of distance or speed in the air. The objects proceeded toward Atlantic Highlands in an easterly direction toward the Atlantic Ocean.

After returning from the railroad station, with her husband, she telephoned the Rumson Police Headquarters and asked Patrolman Otto Pearl, on desk duty, if anyone had reported as unusual phenomena in the sky. She then reported the incident to the Provost Marshal Office at Fort Monmouth and the Newark News, Newark, N. J.

Mrs. [redacted] further stated that she drew an illustration of the objects she saw in the sky. (Photostatic copy attached.)

Case No. 1023

MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

On 29 March 1950, Investigator, Military Intelligence, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, interviewed the individual at his residence, Hartel Hill Circle, Port-mouth, Oceanport, New Jersey.

He stated that at approximately 1752 hours, 15 March 1950, he arrived in Little Silver, New Jersey, by train from New York, N. Y., to his home. As he walked from the train to his automobile he looked over his shoulder, west by northwest, to observe the sky, as it is in his habit to predict the weather from the appearance of the cloud formation and the sun's reflection on the sky in the west. At this time, he noticed that the sun was on the horizon surrounded by scattered cloud formations and visibility was unlimited. Whiles looking he saw three distinct vapor trails very close together that he thought at first glance was sky writing. After considering this possibility for a moment he concluded that no one could be sky writing at that hour of the evening. In Jarman's estimation the vapor trails were at an altitude of approximately 40 to 50 thousand feet and traveling at a speed of a normal sky writing plane. Jarman further stated that his observation was of approximately ten seconds duration and that the vapor trails formed four distinct lines in altitude during this period of time. (The four fingers calculation was concluded by holding his hand at arms length, palm inward and sighting with one eye at the vapor trail). The four fingers covered the vapor trails).

Due to the distance, he was unable to determine what was causing the trails, although he concluded they had just started when he first observed them.

He presently occupies a position as Mechanical Engineer. He was formerly an officer and served with the 306 Field Artillery, 77th Division, during World War II. He stated that he was also an Intelligence Agent during this period and reported periodically to G-2 in Washington, D. C.

1. On 23 March 1950 Investigator [redacted] Intelligence [redacted] using a [redacted], Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, interviewed [redacted] at his place of employment, The E. guish [redacted] Bank, N.J., where he is employed as an automobile mechanic.

Bank, N.J. stated that he was at Ridge Road and Buena Vista Ave., Red noted three white streaks in the sky but could see nothing except the three white streaks. He could not tell what was causing the streaks, except [redacted] could make out three shiny objects which seemed to be in the sky. The sun was just setting and it appeared to him that the rays of the sun were casting reflections from the three objects in the sky. These three objects were moving toward the ocean, coming from a southwesterly direction. These three objects were at a high altitude and made no noise that could be heard. The objects continued on their course and disappeared toward the ocean.

24 March 1950

1. On 23 March 1950 Thomas J. McHANAY, accompanied by John F. KANE, Investigator, Military Intelligence, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, interviewed her residence, Locust St., Waterwitch, Highlands, New Jersey.

1950, while she was walking home on Waterwitch Avenue and upon reaching the Waterwitch Railroad Station, she noted that occupants of an automobile suddenly got out of their car and looked toward the sky. She also looked out the sky and observed three luminous discs, very bright and shiny, with white streaks projecting from the rear of each of the three discs. The male occupant of the automobile said he thought the object resembled some sort of rocket. He said he wished he had a camera so that he could take a picture of the odd sight.

A passenger bus then came along and stopped and the passengers alighted from the bus and also watched the strange phenomena.

described the objects to be gliding along in the sky at a fairly altitude. The objects were visible to the naked eye from the ground. He said that when he first sighted the objects, they were approaching from a southwest direction. The objects continued on over the ocean and disappeared. The sun was setting in the west. The objects were moving without making any noise that could be heard. They did not appear to be airplanes and did not appear as though they were propelled, but were traveling at a high rate of speed.

stated that she was born in Newark, New Jersey, and has resided Waterwitch, Highlands, New Jersey for the past twelve years; is forty-three years of age and is a housewife.

County Chairlady for the Red Cross and is also Chairlady for the Sister Kenny Foundation and Publicity Chairlady of the Highlands Democratic Club.

MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

1. On 24 March 1950, Justus R. LILZE JR., Investigator, Military Intelligence, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, interviewed [redacted] Maintenance Section, Maintenance Branch, Squier Signal [redacted], Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.

[redacted] stated that at approximately 1800 hours, 15 March 1950, he saw two long and rather thick streaks of vapor with a weaker one between them. An indistinguishable object at the head of those streaks moved rather slowly at even speed and in absolutely straight line from almost directly west (somewhat south of west) to almost directly east (somewhat north of east).

The phenomenon was clearly visible for approximately three to four minutes (1800 to 1804 hours). The distance between the vapor streaks stayed the same all during the observation. There was absolutely no sound. The object passed somewhat south of Red Bank.

[redacted] further stated that because of the fact that absolutely no sound could be heard, the vapor streaks were clearly separated with the blue of the sky visible in between, the phenomenon moved rather slowly, or at least appeared to do so, although the whole distance from its point of apparent appearance in the western sky to its vanishing point high up in the eastern sky was covered in about four minutes, he came to the following conclusion:

The object which was painting the very long, vapor streaks into the absolute cloudless sky was either a very large airship or plane with three engines or jets, flying very high, or three smaller planes flying in absolute perfect and equally spaced formation, also very high, in an absolute straight line. Since visibility was perfect, he estimated the distance covered by the object during his observation to be at least 40 miles (in four minutes). The speed of the object, therefore was about 600 miles per hour.
