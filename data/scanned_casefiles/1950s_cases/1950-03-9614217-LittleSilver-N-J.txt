CASE NO. 1023 
MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE:

On 23 March 1950, at approximately 1600 hours, Andrew J. Reid, Civilian Intelligence Officer, Security & Intelligence Division, Fort Monmouth, N.J., interviewed Mrs. Leola Frenckle, 11 Clever Lane, Ramson, N.J. in the presence of Virginia McNally, Secretary, and she further stated that she was riding in her car on Ridge Road, Fair Haven, N.J. on 6 March 1950, shortly after 1700 hours, to meet her husband. As she was driving along the road, she noticed three persons in the sky - writing and seeming to plane as though possibly it could be a queer formation of clouds. A car stopped here, and she and those were riding said she noticed their interest as to the same object. This car stopped for a short distance from hers and she continued to watch the phenomena in the sky, which she described as three luminous round forms hovering and moving as if by some intelligent control through the sky. The objects appeared to be luminous and seemed to be a density of "sky-blue" colored gas. 

Mrs. Frenckle further stated that she could not estimate the height or speed, as she had no conception of distance or speed in the air. The objects proceeded to Atlantic Highlands in an easterly direction toward the Atlantic Ocean.

After returning from the railroad station, with her husband, she telephoned the Rumson Police Headquarters and asked Patrolman Otto Peart, on desk duty, if anyone had reported any unusual phenomena in the sky. She then reported the incident to the Provost Marshal Office at Fort Monmouth and the Army News Service, N. J.

Mrs. Frenckle further stated that she drew an illustration of the objects she saw in the sky. (Photostatic copy attached.)

Case No. 1023

REPORT TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

On 23 March 1950, at approximately 11:35 AM, Investigator, Military Intelligence, interviewed WENDELL CIRCLE, at his residence, Wendell Circle, Fort-ad-Rock, Oceanport, New Jersey.

On 23 March 1950, at approximately 12:45 PM, he arrived in Little Silver, New Jersey, by train in transit from New York, to his home, 14 March 1950, he observed an unidentified object in the sky as it looked over his shoulder, west by northwest, to observe the sky as it passed over his home. He stated that the object was very high in altitude, and the visibility was unlimited, while he watched the object he estimated the length of the object to be approximately 40 to 50 thousand feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 2 to 3 thousand miles per hour. Further stated that his observation was of approximately ten seconds duration and that the vapor trails he saw, although somewhat diffused, were at an attitude of approximately 40 to 50 thousand feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 2000 to 3000 miles per hour.

Due to the distance, it was unable to determine what was causing the trails he saw, although he concluded they had just started when he first observed them.

He apparently occupies a position as Mechanical Engineer. He was formerly an officer and served with the 206 Field Artillery, 76th Division, during World War II. He stated that he was also an Intelligence Agent during this period and reported periodically to G-2 in Washington, D.C.

MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

1. On 23 March 1950 Investigator--, a Civilian, Intelligence Agent, interviewed W. B. Platt, at his place of employment, The B. Altrich Bank Note Works where he is employed as an automobile mechanic.

Platt, N.J., at approximately 7:22 A.M. EDT, observed three bright objects in the sky about three miles west of Tenafly, N.J. He could not tell what was causing the streaks, except he could make out three shiny objects which seemed to be trailing something. The sun was just setting and it appeared to him that the rays of the sun were casting a reflection from the three objects in the sky. These three objects were moving toward the ocean, coming from a southwesterly direction. These three objects were high altitude and made no noise whatsoever. They continued on their course and disappeared toward the ocean.

MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE
1. On 23 March 1950 Thomas J. McMANAMY accompanied by John F. KANE, investigators, Military Intelligence, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, interviewed Mrs. WEXLER, Route 20, Wateritch, Highlands, New Jersey.
She stated that at approximately 1740 hours on 15 March 1950, while she was walking home on Waterwitch Avenue and upon reaching the Highlands Railroad Station, she noticed the occupants of an automobile suddenly get out of their car and look up toward the sky. She also looked at the sky and observed three luminous, bright and shiny, with white streaks projecting from the rear of each of the three discs. The male occupants of the automobile said he thought he would be able to take a picture of the objects if he had a camera, so that he could take a picture of the odd sight.
A passenger bus then came along and stopped and the passengers alighted from the bus and also watched the strange phenomena.
Mrs. WEXLER described the objects to be gliding along in the sky at a good rate of speed and said that the objects appeared to be about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. She said that when the objects first sighted, they were traveling from the south, but later changed direction and continued out over the ocean and disappeared. The sun was setting in the west. The objects were travelling at a high rate of speed. They did not appear to be airplanes and did not appear though they were propelled, but were travelling at a high rate of speed.
She stated that she was born in Newark, New Jersey, and has lived in Highlands, New Jersey for the past twelve years; is forty-three years of age and is a housewife.
She was serving as Chairlady for the Red Cross and is also County Chairlady for the Sister Kenny Foundation and Publicity Chairlady of the Highlands Democratic Club.

MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

1. On 24 March 1950, Justus E. LILIE JR., Investigator, Military Intelligence Section, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, interviewed Pvt. Jeffrey, the Jet Observer, Headquarters, Maintenance Branch, Signal Section, 

Spar and reported that at approximately 1900 hours, 12 March 1950, he and two long and white streaks observed crossing his rear (somewhere between south or west) to almost directly east (somewhat north of east).

The phenomenon was clearly visible for approximately three to four minutes (4000 to 4500 hours) during the vapor trails of the vapor trails which was almost absolutely no sound.

It was further stated that because of the fact that absolutely no sound could be heard, the vapor phenomenon is clearly separated from the blue of the sky, in that the vapor trails were so very thin and wispy in characteristics, the apparent appearance in the western sky to its vanishing point high in the eastern sky was observed in about four minutes.

In absolute perfect and equally spaced formation, also very high, in an absolute straight line. Since visibility was perfect, he estimated the distance covered by the object during his observation to be at least 400 miles (at four minutes duration). The speed of the object, therefore, was about 600 miles per hour.

1. Direction of Flight
2. Length of Streaks.
