1 December 1950

Statement of Major [redacted]

On Thanksgiving Day, 23 November 1950, between 1508 and 1525, I saw four objects which I could not identify.

They appeared to be about 3/8" in diameter, perfectly circular and very hi[redacted]. They were brilliantly white, almost porcelain white. By measuring the distance and time involved, they were moving very fast.

The first object came from about 2.0° and, when over Montgomery, ascended to a very great height. As it descended, it appeared to turn over and over. This object then moved off rapidly to the NE and disappeared. My wife saw this object as it was descending over Montgomery and moving off to the NE, as this object rolled over several times while ascending and descending I could tell it was round when viewed from the bottom and thin when viewed from the side.

A few minutes later another one passed over very quickly, same direction, level flight, disappeared to the NE. I was not able to obtain a witness to this one as my wife had gone inside the house. It was after this I called out Captain [redacted] and told him I had seen some unusual objects. For several minutes we saw nothing. Captain [redacted] went into his house.

After a few minutes two more of the objects came over together, they came from about 180°, one continued on out of sight to the north rising rapidly but the other turned and came back over. This object then began to ascend and rapidly passed out of sight. As soon as I saw these objects I called Captain [redacted] who came out at once and definitely saw these objects. He could not identify them either.

All 4 of these objects appeared to be about the same size. However, one of them seemed to have an antenna (the one of the last two that moved to the north and then returned to ascend). I am sure the objects were not balloons. The weather was clear, no clouds, a check with Base Weather indicated the wind was from [remainder of text cut off]

Statement of Captain

On the afternoon of Thanksgiving Day, 23 November 1950, while I was in my quarters, ELIC LAFS, Major knocked on my door and said, "I just saw a flying saucer." Captain, who was with me at the time, and I went out-side to talk to Major. Later that same afternoon, after Captain had left my home, Major knocked again and asked me to come outside in a hurry because he thought I would be able to see another object ("flying saucer") before it got out of sight. I ran outside and quickly focused my eyes on an object that he pointed to. I instantly saw a second object.

As far as I can remember they were directly over the building in which we live; they were white in color; one following the other. I remarked to Major that one object looked like a seagull suspended in mid-air with its wings extended but stiff and motionless. The second object appeared to be two lengths behind the leader and at the same altitude. The second object looked like a white ball, the diameter of which appeared to be the same as the width, at the widest part, of the object that looked like a seagull. They were stationary for about one minute. Then they started moving north and gaining altitude.

They disappeared about 30 seconds after they started moving. The two objects kept the same relative position to each other during the entire time.
