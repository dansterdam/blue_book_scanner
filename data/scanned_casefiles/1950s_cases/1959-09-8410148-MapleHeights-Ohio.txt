What appeared to be an oval shaped object (about the size of an auto radiator) called to attention of the writer. The object remained stationary, Dull white or light grey in color, No visible means of propulsion, no exhaust, no windows or markings on the outside. The object remained motionless for about 10 minutes, then rose straight up, at a very high rate of speed, and was lost to sight within 2 to 3 minutes. The object was very quiet and without any visible means of propulsion. This sighting was made by 4 adults, 3 men and 1 woman. The object appeared to be 500 to 700 feet above the ground and about 1/2 mile distant. Due to the size, location, and manner of departure, the writer believes the object was under intelligent control.

The image contains two sketches that appear to be part of a UFO investigation report. The first sketch shows a curved path or trajectory of an object above the horizon, and the second sketch shows a larger view of a landscape with a person standing in the road.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
