SCIENCE NEWS LETTER

THE WEEKLY SUMMARY OF CURRENT SCIENCE

ASTRONOMY
Amateur Discovers
Two New Comets
See From Cover

A BRITISH SCHOOL teacher and amateur astronomer has reported sighting two new comets. Comet Alock 1959, as one is called (named after its discoverer), George Alock(s), is the brightest comet seen in several years. It was first seen on Aug. 30.

The photograph on the cover of this week's SCIENCE NEWS LETTER is a ten-minute exposure of the comet, taken at the U. S. Naval Observatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., on Tuesday morning, Sept. 1. The short lines going across the picture are stars. They are trailed because the plate was moved during exposure to follow the comet's motion.

Comet 1959, the other comet discovered by Mr. Alock, is reported to be not as bright as Comet 1959. It also lacks the tail observed on Comet 1959.

STRANGE ASPECTS OF
TEXAS BRANIFF CRASH

On the front page of the November 1959
issue of the Bulletin, comment pertaining
to the crash of a Braniff Airways turbo-
prop airliner elicited further information
from David Wuliger, APRO member in
Houston, Clippings containing press state-
ments made by R. B. Carleton, vice-
president in charge of operations for
Braniff, included the following informa-
tion: Carleton, who had been leading a
crew of airline technicians investigating
the crash scene, said an engine explosion
may have caused the crash. He also
said that glass window parts in a recov-

ered portion of the 113,000 pound airplane
showed signs of tremendous exterior heat,
but that the blast which disintegrated the
big ship did not come from within the
plane. A veteran Air Force pilot testified
before a three-man Civil Aeronautics
Board that he had seen a massive, much-
room-shaped red stationary glow in the
area on the night of the crash. The
officer, Maj. R. O. Braswell of Ellington
AFB, Houston, was on his way from
Shreveport, La., to Lubin in a C-47 when
he spotted the atomic-cloud-shaped burn-
ing mass, three to five degrees above
him—an enormous thing, he said.

The Houston Press reported on Decem-
ber 10 that 200 Fort Hood soldiers fanned
out through the woods and fields near
Buffalo on December 9 in further efforts
to turn up additional pieces of the air-
liner, which crashed on 29 September
1959. CAB investigator John Crockett declined reports that a deadly air-to-air Side-
wind missile had somehow broken free
and homed in on the airliner, causing the
crash.

On October 21st, the Houston Press
reported details of the hearing which
took place in the Buffalo, Texas gym-
nasium. Several of the statements by
witnesses are most important. CAB in-
vestigator Joseph Zamudis said that at
11 p.m., just 9 minutes before the crash,
the flight engineer had looked the fact
that they were cruising at 15,000 feet,
air speed 275 knots, all engine instru-

Eye-witness W. S. Webb testified that
he had just gone to bed on the night of
September 29 when, while gazing out
the window, he "saw a light in the sky."
I thought it was lightning at first, but
it didn't disappear. A few seconds later
a ball of fire that looked like a star
shot through the sky. Then I heard a
noise like something was falling through
the sky. It was a whooshing, shrill sound.
I guess the first was two-thirds of
the way from the ground when it
exploded."

A 39-year-old retired engineer, Jackie
J. Cox, testified: "I was going home to
Buffalo when I noticed a low lying cloud
in the sky and heard the noise of a plane
which sounded louder than normal. You
could feel the vibrations on the ground.
I heard the plane for about 10 seconds
and then saw a bright orange light in the
sky. It spread to cover the entire sky,
as if phosphorus or magnesium were
burning." Mr. Cox said after he had
driven about a half a mile he noticed
another flash, which appeared twice. Af-
ter the second flash there was a noise
like thunder.

Billie Guyton of Centerville testified
that he noticed a small glow spread to
cover the sky, that he saw a falling
object come from the glow, first going
forward and then straight down. After
the object fell, he heard a thunderlike
noise.

It appears that something else was in
the sky that night near Buffalo—some-
thing in a cloud. At the same time, in
the same location, an airliner carried 34
people to their deaths.

Perhaps this is why 250 military per-
sonnel searched the area for the second
time weeks after the initial investigation
and search were completed.
