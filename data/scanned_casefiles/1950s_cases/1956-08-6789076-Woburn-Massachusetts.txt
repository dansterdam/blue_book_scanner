ATIC FORM 329 (REV 25 SEP 57)


- page 1 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

13 NOV 56 14 05

[Most of the text in the body of the document is too illegible to read clearly]

At the bottom of the page, there are some handwritten notes:

3/4 = 1
3/4 x 7 = 5

[There are also some partially legible signatures or scribbled notes on the right side of the page]

The document appears to be a partially redacted or poorly scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report dated 13 November 1956.
