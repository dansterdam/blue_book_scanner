I first noticed these objects when I glanced up and saw three bright lights in line moving from the S.E. almost directly overhead. I called every one's attention to them and said that they did not seem to be planes. The rest of the people present agreed that they did seem strange. I said then, "I wonder if they are flying." No one replied to that. Off with distance we could see three lines of a place. Then one of the women said that just 36 miles or most. I then saw a plane at night that looked like lines fairly. We flew in that formation. Everyone then agreed to that point. About then the objects disappeared behind the next door house. But just before they did, the middle one faded out. It did not wink or like a light does, but rapidly faded out like firefly sometimes do.

THE THREE OBJECTS WERE IN A STRAIGHT LINE THE FIRST ONE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE ONE TRAIL THE REAR ONE. THE REAR ONE ALSO WAS A BIT TO ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER TWO LINE. THE DRAWING

AND IT SEEMED TO FLUTTER OR WOBBLE A BIT. THE FIRST THE JUST FLEW VERY STEADY DURING THE ENTIRE SIGHTING. THEY WERE A BRIGHT ORANGE-WHITE, AND STAYED THE SAME COLOR, EXCEPT FOR THE MIDDLE ONE WHICH PHASED OUT. THEY WERE FAIRLY SHARPLY OUTLINED, MORE OVAL OR LESS SHAPED, THAN ROUND. THEY FLEW IN A SLIGHT CURVE TOWARDS THE MEADOWS TOWARDS UPPER MANHATTAN AND THE BRONX, WHICH WAS ABOUT 30 MILES (CAN) AWAY, FROM THE LOCATION WHERE I SAW THEM.

THEY SEEMED TO TRAVEL ABOUT AS FAST AS A JET ONLY WITHOUT NOISE, WITHOUT ANY TRAIL OF ANY SORT. THEY WERE ABOUT AS LARGE AS THE HEAD OF A KITCHEN MATCH. WAS FIRST SEEN, AND WAS LAST SEEN, ABOUT HALF THAT SIZE, AS THEY TRAVELED AWAY FROM ME. THE SPEED REMAINED STEADY, WHAT LITTLE THEY WERE. I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM VERY CERTAIN THEY WERE NOT PLANES. IT GAVE ME A EERIE FEELING WATCHING THEM, AND APPARENTLY IT AFFECTED THE REST OF THE PEOPLE PRESENT THE SAME WAY, TO NO ONE SAID VERY MUCH DURING THE SIGHTING. OR IMMEDIATELY THESE AFTER. I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED IT WITH MANY PEOPLE.
