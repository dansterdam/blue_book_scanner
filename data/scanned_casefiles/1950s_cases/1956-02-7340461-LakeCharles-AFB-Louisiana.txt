The image contains two hand-drawn sketches that appear to be representations of the observed object. Based on the instructions, there are no human faces present in the image, so I will describe the sketches without identifying any individuals.

The text in the document states:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Whistling sound
b. Color - White in color, glowing in a bright glow

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as the time, position, color, direction and speed of travel, shape, etc. Place a mark beside the drawing to show the direction from which you saw the object.

The two sketches provided show two oval-shaped objects, with one appearing more elongated than the other. The sketches appear to be hand-drawn and are labeled "Changed to" and "Cloud-like".

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
                b. Like a bright star

                d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

There appears to be no photograph present on this page of the Project Blue Book report document. The page contains a questionnaire with various questions about the sighting of an unidentified object, including instructions to draw a picture showing the motion of the object. The respondent has provided handwritten answers to the questions.

The text from the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Moving up - Slowing velocity

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. feet

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Quarter
e. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Faded out

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine what you could construct the object out of what type material would you use? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Material similar to stainless steel or aluminum. The size would be about 4 or 5 feet in diameter and would appear disc-shaped. Its peculiar characteristics - maneuvering ability, velocity, and ability to disappear could have been achieved by some means of repelling gravity, using a method of propulsion not presently known. The object could have been utilizing an energy source as yet undiscovered by man.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved line with an "A" and "B" labelled on it, along with an object above the horizon line. The second sketch contains two panels - the left panel shows a landscape scene with a person standing on a road, while the right panel depicts a smaller landscape sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
