8.    No other unusual circumstances which might account for this sighting were
      reported. Intensive surface, wave making to diminish possibilities of watches,
      billows, aircraft, glares, etc. as being source of sighting. None of the above
      could be counted as having been in the area.

9.    No interception action was taken.

      of the sighting. Pilot reported negative visual contact.

11.   Preparing officer: 1st Lt DAVID A GILBERT, 1070-2 AACS Det., GOA
      Officer. Comments: Sighting reports appear to be conclusive. After investigating
      possible explanations with some known objects, cannot definitely involve an unidentified object.

12.   Negative physical evidence or photographs were obtained.

STATEMENT

21 October 1957

At 1740 on the 12th of Oct. an unidentified object was sighted by A/2C Pringle and A/2C Hargreaves. The above named airmen were on duty in the control tower at the time. The object was at an unknown altitude in the vicinity from the station. When first sighted the object appeared to be approximately 6 degrees above the horizon, then first observed it dropped to approximately 3 degrees above the horizon. When first sighted the object was south 108° of Mildenhall. At 1800 when the object was obscured from the two's vision it had moved approximately 10-15 degrees. At 1765 the weather observer working in the tower was notified. The wx observer said he could not identify the object, but it definitely was not a star or other celestial body. At 1803 Lakenheath A.T.C. was advised that they had no aircraft in the area. At 1801 Mildenhall A.T.C. was advised, they also said they had no aircraft in the area. The U.F.O. was obscured from the twr's vision at 1800 by clouds.

During the sightings of the object it appeared to be circular and a light yellow color at first, then changing to a definite orange and being obscured by clouds.

At 1926 Lakenheath RATCC advised HT twr, they could see an object to the SE of LD. LAPON said the object was changing colors from yellow to green and was stationary. Lakenheath checked an balloon in that area plus aircraft and reported neither in the area. HT received a wide alert. At 1930 Lakenheath advised HT they saw 3 large objects on their radar. At 1935 two jets were scrambled from (illegible) miles. The two jets were also stationary. The 3rd target was moving slowly toward the station. Also the target(s) were visible from Lakenheath. HT was advised and also picked up targets which coincided with Lakenheath.

At 2155 the twr advised flight service of the U.F.O.

At 2040 Schulthorp WK station picked up the unidentified targets on their radar. The position coincided with those Lakenheath Control and Mildenhall GCA had reported. Schulthorp WK station tracked one of the targets from NW of LD to 9 miles S of HT, then it turned to go west.

At 2255 Schulthorp had a stationary target 8 miles NE of HT at this time they reported turning of their radar.

STATEMENT

21 October 1957

Time First Observed: 1718 Local
Where Observed From: West end of GCA shack
Position: West of Field, hovering

Appearance: Circular beige colored light. Changed shades, but stayed same color. Dismissed same as star.

Tower notified GCA at 1920 of object tracked visually from 1718 with azimuth described object as similar to one sighted at 1718 by GCA. Climbed out west door of shack and noted object first sighted was cons. Power advised Lakenheath Control had sighted object visually, then on radar. Coordinated with Lakenheath and noted in position they indicated. Two targets appeared on scope approximately 11-13 miles NNW of Mildenhall.

Appearance on scope: Util's other targets. More circular than rectangular. About 6/16 (dim) unable to cut out fuzziness with gain control. Time: 1934 Chiggia appeared to hover. Maintained radar contact for approximately 4-5 min. Then targets began to fade. (Targets definitely not clouds.) Radar reported unusual difference of radio receivers at this time. Lakenheath had some disturbance. Radar: 11K 4-7-8-9 (units) slight to short of reliability. In Quadrant: 4-5-6-7-8-9 to make low approaches to hill at approximately 4000. Indicated unidentified, had radar from scope. At this time, Pilot did not request any unusual objects on low approach to W/T 29.

Balthorpe weather radar reported 2 objects at 2141 local, 270 of IT. Position were checked and 2 targets were at same position on our surveillance scope approximately 4 miles SE. One was under on our search scope, but unidentified. Showed additional tracking. Utilizing approximately 4-5-9 miles SE of IT at this time (covering) then the tracking approximately 4-5-9 from IT. Inbound. Presumed it was meteor, however, later reported over radar. Total position was approximately 115 mi. Pilot was not requested to investigate. No more data available.
