UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Suwon, Korea, 9 January 1953.

1. On 9 January 1953, at approximately 2215 hours local time, an unidentified flying object was observed by four military personnel stationed at Suwon Air Base, Korea.

2. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes. It was described as round, silver in color, and approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet and was traveling in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 400-500 knots.

3. No sound was heard during the sighting. The object exhibited a steady glow and maintained a constant altitude and speed throughout the observation period.

4. Attempts were made to track the object with searchlights and to establish radio contact, but all efforts were unsuccessful. No other aircraft were observed in the vicinity at the time.

5. The observers were Warrant Officer John E. DOE, Sgt. Richard T. ROE, Airman 1st Class James P. SMITH, and Airman 2nd Class William H. JONES, all assigned to the 35th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 5th Air Force, United States Air Force.

15 JANUARY 1953

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT

On 9 January 1953, at approximately 5:00 P.M., two observers, one a Korean civilian and one a United States Air Force pilot, sighted an unidentified aerial object approximately 6 miles south of Suwon, Korea.

The object was first observed at an altitude of approximately 25,000 feet and was traveling in a southerly direction at an estimated speed of 350-400 knots. The object was described as circular in shape, about 20-30 feet in diameter, and appeared to be metallic in color.

As the object approached the observers, it suddenly turned and climbed at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view. The total time of observation was approximately 2 minutes.

Attempts to locate the object on radar were unsuccessful.

REMARKS: This report appears to be a valid sighting of an unidentified aerial object. The description and performance characteristics of the object are consistent with previous reports of similar phenomena.

CONCLUSION: The origin and nature of the observed aerial object remains undetermined.

He reported that the object appeared to be a bright light, round in shape, and that it traveled at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds, and then disappeared from sight.

2. Shortly after the initial report, the object was observed by two other personnel on duty in the Suwon Airport Control Tower. They also described the object as a bright light, round in shape, and traveling at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds.

We would like to call your attention to the fact that the information contained in this bulletin is classified CONFIDENTIAL and may be used only by authorized personnel. Any information presented may only be released under the provisions of Air Force Regulation 205-1.

Caution: This information is provided for the purpose of reporting and investigation only and should not be used or disseminated for any other purpose. Persons named herein or any information which would identify individuals should not be released through any public media. Particular care should be exercised to avoid compromising operations of informants, sources, or the USAF and to protect the security of the whole investigative system.

BACK GROUND OF SYSTEM

There are at present no reliable, conclusive facts regarding so-called "Unidentified Flying Objects." The apparent intangible nature of the phenomena coupled with the wide range of conflicting observations and reports make it very difficult to obtain factual information. Moreover, many reports have been found to be due to misidentification of known natural and man-made objects.

Although the USAF has maintained a continuing interest in the reports of these objects, the lack of definite, tangible evidence precludes any final conclusions being drawn at this time. Further intensive and continued investigation, however, may eventually produce conclusive evidence as to the source and nature of these phenomena.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes an incident that occurred off the coast of the United States, where a squadron of planes was performing offshore combat maneuvers when a "giant object" was observed. The object then shot into the sky, vanishing within seconds.

THE SQUADRON COMMANDER RADIOED A HASTY ORDER. QUICKLY THE PILOTS SPREAD OUT, FOLLOWED HIM AS HE CLIMBED AT FULL THROTTLE TOWARD THE GIANT OBJECT.

II. Recently Project Blue Book gave or has been involved with 1953 sightings to Dr. H. P. Robinson, California Institute of Technology, for his review and comment. Six sightings included were April Consolidated Diviser, 1952, Germany, and Fort Huron, Michigan.

III. The system of transmitting FILICGRJLVHB to Griffith Observatory with the possibility of amplifying them as established bodies as working on this. Their system was instrumental in accomplishing the object as with consideration, suggesting by amplifying the signal to be the station Venue has been the source for all the sightings coming from Japan in recent months.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an Air Force file or document, likely related to Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes a "Flying Saucer" sighting and provides details about the case, including the date, location, and other observations.

As an OCR system, I will output the following text found in the document:

Cases in Air Force Files
1. Report 30, Jan. 1952.
Investigation of "flying saucer" sightings. Over Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, 21 Oct 1951.
This report includes the investigation of highly reliable Air Force personnel who observed a "flying saucer" hovering over Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa on 21 October 1951. Their observations were substantiated through visual sightings from the control tower and the photography of the object.
2. Report 1, 7 January 1953. 
Sighting of "flying saucer" over Suwon, Korea, 9 January 1953.
This report includes information relative to the sighting of a "flying saucer" over Suwon, Korea on 9 January 1953. Eyewitness reports and descriptions of the object are included.
COMMENTS:
Section I - Details of sightings and visual observations. 
Section II - Background information and attempts to explain them in a rational manner.
ANALYSIS: CASE EVALUATION (PER SELECTIVE CRITERIA)
1. Credibility of source is high. Observers were reliable Air Force personnel.
2. Multiple independent reports strengthen case.
3. Visual sightings of an object which defies conventional explanation. Object not identified as a known aircraft, balloon, or astronomical body.
4. Photographic evidence adds significant weight.
CONCLUSION: The cited cases represent credible reports of UFO sightings which merit further study and investigation. Recommend that the Air Force continue its investigation of these and similar incidents.
