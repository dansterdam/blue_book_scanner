SUMMARY: (State under summary of report. Give significant to final war-warning paragraph. List incidents in lower left. Begin last of report on AF Form 112-Part 112)

Scrambling out of Greater Pittsburgh Airport at 0300S, 24 May 1954, COI Flights "Norm" informed that a 600 position spotted an orange light at about 35,000 feet. 1 then climbed to 17,000 feet. I observed a strong, bright, slightly west of the city at the aircraft. Occasionally the light alternated to a red slow. Although my observations were limited, I was indicating that the light was definitely a solid object. The light disappeared three times, reappearing west of Detroit at approximately 26,000 feet. An estimated 10 miles away. Thereafter visual contact was made. Positive identification of the object in the area was not possible. The condition was clear and the visibility was extremely good.
