Chapter v

OUT OF THE SKY: METEORS AND FIREBALLS

About one o'clock in the afternoon on November 30, 1954, a spectacular meteor flared across the southeastern part of the United States and exploded. Many persons in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi saw the bright flash high in the sky, followed by a trail of smoke, and heard three violent detonations. Over the town of Sylacauga, Alabama, a nine-pound fragment of the falling meteoric body crashed through the roof of a house, bruised the left arm and hip of the unlucky resident, and came to rest on the floor. Members of the American Meteoritics Society collected detailed descriptions of the event from many witnesses and added this daylight fireball to the official list of observed meteorite falls from which meteorites are recovered [1, p. 128].

UFO addicts, however, apparently regarded both the meteor and its fragments as unnatural phenomena, and a leading exponent of the saucer theory characterized the bright flash as "mysterious," the explosions as both "strange" and "mysterious," the nine-pound fragment as a "shining black object" that was "labeled" a meteorite, and the entire incident as a "queer business" [2, p. 231].

To the astronomer who specializes in the study of meteors the only "queer" aspect of the episode is that saucer publications list so few mysterious UFOs for that particular week when similar spectacular fireballs were almost a commonplace in the southeast states.

On November 29 a meteor flew over Alabama at 5:30 P.M., and about two hours later another with a long tail soared over Florida. On November 30 at 5:00 P.M., a few hours after the fall at Sylacauga, another bright fireball flashed over Alabama. Shortly before midnight the same night a meteor named over North Carolina, so brilliant that its copper-green light illuminated the interior of cars on the highway; blue-green fire shot out above treetops, changed to magnesium white, and then slowly faded. Detailed observations of all these appeared in the scientific journal Meteoritics [1, p. 128].

There's Gold in That Thar Meteorite

SYLACAUGA, Ala., Dec. 3.— 
The owners of the only meteorite known to have struck a human said today they plan to sell the object "to the highest bidder" and hope to get more than $5,000.

Mr. and Mrs. Hewlett Hodges said the $5,000-price was suggested by an attorney who was charged to see that no one tried to keep the meteorite from its rightful owners.

Mrs. Hodges was on a sofa Tuesday when the ninepound rock came crashing through her roof. The meteorite badly bruised her. She entered a hospital because of nervous shock, she said.

The Air Force now has the stone and sent a message to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. A colonel from Wright-Patterson was telephoned Mr. Hodges and assured him the meteorite would be returned. But he couldn't say when.

A Muncie, Ind., munitions factory, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the state museum of natural history are among those interested in purchasing the object.

DAILY NEWS
ROUND TRIP

Alabama's Star Now
Closer To Housewife

WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.— The nine-pound, "transient" meteorite was on the next-to-the-last leg of its travels which started when it fell from the skies 10 days ago and bopped in Alabama housewife on the arm while she was resting.

Democratic Rep. Kenneth A. Roberts of Alabama said Hulet M. Love, an attorney from Talladega, Ala., obtained the meteorite for Mrs. Hulet Hodges, Sylacauga, Ala., housewife, in a ceremony in his office yesterday.

Rep. Roberts said the Air Force turned over the stone to Love, who represented Mrs. Hodges, after he had arranged for its return a week ago. The meteorite had been under study at the Air Technical Intelligence center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton.

Maj. Gen. Joe W. Kelly, director of Air Force liaison on Capitol Hill, handed it over to attorney Love. He said the Air Force had taken possession of it last week as part of its responsibility for "everything that falls from the skies."

Love said Mrs. Hodges plans to sell the meteorite to the highest bidder. He said several "fantastic offers" have been received, ranging from $2 to $20,000.

She Gets Back
The Meteorite
That Hit Her

Washington, Dec. 9 (U.P.)— Mrs. Hewlett Hodges got her meteorite back today. The Air Force formally returned to the 32-year-old Sylacauga, Ala., housewife the 10-pound meteorite that crashed through the roof of her home Nov. 30 and struck her on the arm and hip.

Mrs. Hodges is hospitalized. Her attorney, Huet M. Love of Talladega, Ala., accepted the stone from Maj. Gen. Joe W. Kelly in the office of Rep. Kenneth A. Roberts (D-Ala.) and said it would be sold to the highest bidder.

$20,000 Offer

Love said the Hodges have received "fantastic offers" for the meteorite, ranging up to $20,000. He said he would turn the stone over to the Smithsonian Institution for a thorough scientific analysis before it is sold.

E. P. Henderson, Smithsonian curator, said the meteorite was the first witnessed fall that ever struck a human being. "It smashed through the roof of the Hodges' home and struck Mrs. Hodges, causing a bruise," Kelly said the Air Force took temporary possession of the stone as part of its responsibility for "everything that falls from the skies."

Go and Catch a Falling Star

When John Donne wrote "Go and catch a falling star" he thought he was creating an image of impossibility. But Mrs. Hulett Hodges of Sylacauga, Ala., who perhaps doesn't read John Donne (few people do), these days, very nearly caught a falling star. Rather, it very nearly caught her. She was struck on the hip and hand by a meteorite that ripped through the roof of her home while she was taking a nap. It was only a nine-pound meteorite, an astral fragment which the skies will never miss.

Now Mrs. Hodges, it is her meteorite, her personal evidence that stars once really fell on Alabama.

Now they want to take it away from her. "They" means the Air Force and the State Museum of Natural History. The Air Force has taken possession of the meteorite and says it will be sent to Washington for scientific research. The museum, located in Tuscaloosa, says it wants the meteorite for display purposes.

Mrs. Hodges, who obviously is a forthright woman, says she wants the meteorite neither for display nor for research. She merely wants to preserve it, in the good old American fashion, as a souvenir to talk about when folks drop in.

"Science, of course, must be served, and perhaps some kind of a compromise can be worked out whereby the Air Force can conduct its experiments and return the meteorite forthwith to Mrs. Hodges. In her turn, she might be willing to lend it to the museum occasionally, say on alternate Sundays. But it might well be made the law of the land: any meteorite falling on any person shall belong to said person. Let others go and catch their own falling star."

IN EVANSVILLE

Ex-Daytonian Seeks
Mrs. Hodges' Meteor
By BETTY A. DIETZ
Daily News Staff Writer

When "Mrs. Hodges' meteorite" leaves Dayton's Wright-Patterson Air Force base, it may continue under the Dayton Influence.

For if Siegried Weng, former Daytonian, has his way, "the star that fell on Alabama" will wind up in his custody at the Evansville, Ind., Museum of Arts and Sciences.

Weng, director of the Evansville Institution, says museum officials are "up in the clouds" over the prospect of acquiring the meteorite that fell on the Salamanca, Ala. housewife.

Mrs. Hewlett Hodges was lying on a sofa in her living room when the nine-pound meteorite made her see stars last week. Mrs. Hodges, whose hip and hand were bruised by the blow, is believed to be the only person who was ever hit by a meteorite and survived.

FOR 20 YEARS director of the Dayton Art Institute, Weng said Tuesday in a telephone conversation that the Indiana museum's bid of $5000 for the meteorite still tops the list of nearly 100 offers. An attorney for Mrs. Hodges also indicated she was particularly interested in seeing the Evansville museum get the meteor.

Dick Cull Jr., writing for The Daily News bureau in Washington, Monday revealed that the Smithsonian museum would like to have the heavenly rock. But curators there admit they aren't willing to pay more than $100 a pound or a total of $900 for the meteor.

If the owner—Mrs. Hodges—can get a higher price, she'd better take it "with a kiss," said a spokesman for the Smithsonian's division of mineralogy and petrology. The larger the meteor, the lower the value, he added. However, the Smithsonian has offered a free appraisal of the meteor.

The rock was delivered Monday to Wright-Patterson Air Force base where it is being studied by Air Technical Intelligence center officials.

WENG SAID the meteor is of scientific interest for two reasons. "First, many have been hit by meteors before but Mrs. Hodges is the first to survive. Second, the rock may substantiate the theory that the core of meteors is very cold."

When R. Malcolm Koch, president of the Evansville museum and an astronomer by avocation, talked to Mrs. Hodges she was astonished when he asked her if the meteor had been cold. Mrs. Hodges told Koch the rock had been too cold to handle, according to Weng.

Acquisition of the meteor should make the Evansville museum a national shrine. Weng is convinced. The museum, which has an all-public planetarium, one of two in Indiana, is now raising funds for new quarters. Weng said the drive has thus far brought in $169,000, against a needed $560,000.
