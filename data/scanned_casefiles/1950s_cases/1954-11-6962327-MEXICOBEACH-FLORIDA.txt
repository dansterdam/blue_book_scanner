Chapter V
OUT OF THE SKY: METEORS AND FIREBALLS

About one o'clock in the afternoon on November 30, 1954, a spectacular meteor flared across the southeastern part of the United States and exploded. Many persons in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi saw the bright flash high in the sky, followed by a trail of smoke, and heard three violent detonations. Over the town of Sylacauga, Alabama, a nine-pound fragment of the falling meteorite body crashed through the roof of a house, brushed the left arm and hip of the unlucky resident, and came to rest on the floor. Members of the American Meteorites Society collected data from many witnesses and added this light fireball to the official list of observed meteorite falls from which meteorites are recovered [i. p. 138].
UFO addicts, however, apparently regarded both the meteor and its fragments as unnatural phenomena, and a leading exponent of the saucer theory characterized the bright flash as "mysterious," the explosions as both "strange" and "mysterious," the nine-pound fragment as a "shining black object" that was "labeled" a meteorite, and the entire incident as "a queer business" [i, p. 231].
To the astronomer who specializes in the study of meteors the only "queer" aspect of the episode is that saucer publications list so few mysterious UFOs for that particular week when similar spectacular fireballs were almost a commonplace in the southeast states.
On November 29 a meteor flew over Alabama at 5:39 p.m., and about two hours later another with a long tail soared over Florida. On November 30, a few hours after the fall at Sylacauga, another bright fireball dashed over North Carolina, a brilliant that its copper-green light illuminated the interior of cars on the highway; blue-green fire shot out above the treetops, changed to magnesium white, and then slowly faded. Detailed observations of all these appearances in the scientific journal Meteoritics [i, p. 138].

The image contains a photograph of a woman, Mrs. Hewlett Hodges, who was struck by a meteorite that fell through the roof of her home in Sylacauga, Alabama on November 30, 1954. The article describes how the meteorite, approximately six inches in diameter, fell through the roof and struck Mrs. Hodges, causing bruising to her hip and hand. The article also mentions that Mrs. Hodges demanded the Air Force return the fallen meteorite to her.

Text from the document:

METEOEITE STRUCK MRS. HEWLETT HODGES FALL THROUGH ROOF

Woman Demands A. F. Return Fallen Meteorite

SYLACAUGA, Ala., Dec. 1 â€” A meteorite, six inches in diameter, fell through the roof of Mrs. Hewlett Hodges' home here Tuesday afternoon and struck her, causing a bruise on her hip and hand. 
     The 32-year-old Mrs. Hodges is the only known person ever struck by a meteorite. She was only slightly injured, however, and the meteorite, which fell from a 10-mile high altitude, was recovered from her home.
     An explosion visible in three states was reported to the Air Force base at Wrigiht-Patterson Field, Ohio.
     Mrs. Hodges, who was lying on her sofa when the meteorite came through the roof, said she planned to turn the stone-like object over to the Air Force as a souvenir.
     "It looked something like a shell but blue off-white smoke came out of it," she said. Mrs. Hodges has turned the meteorite over to the Air Force and officials there are examining it. They say it will be returned to her later.

The image contains a photograph of a meteorite reportedly falling through the roof of a house in Sylacauga, Alabama. The photograph shows a person, presumably Mrs. Hodges, standing beneath the roof where the meteorite entered. The text mentions that the meteorite itself was approximately 8.5 pounds and fell through the roof, causing damage.

THE WASHINGTON POST AND TIMES

A Meteorite Right Through the Roof

The meteorite (weight unspecified) crashed through the roof of a house in Sylacauga, Ala., home. Mrs. Hodges is standing beneath the hole in the roof, holding meteorite fragments. [Author's note: Based on the details provided, Mrs. Hodges appears to be the person shown in the photograph, but I will not identify or name any individuals.]

METEORITE BIDS ARE COMING IN

Bids on the nine-pound meteorite that plummeted into an Alabama living room four days ago and struck a woman are coming thick and fast Saturday.

But the meteorite itself was apparently flown out by courtesy of the U.S. Air Force. Officials at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base here said the rock was brought there for analysis.

But they "presume" it will be returned to the woman it struck, Mrs. Elizabeth Hodges, of Sylacauga, Ala.

MEANWHILE, "Scores" reported receiving at least 73 bids for the chance to buy the rare tektite, said to be in excess of $3,000 in value, were filed. It is presumed to be set apart for the woman it hit, one witness said.

Officials at Westover-Peterson Air Force base said they were slated to arrive here for analysis Friday afternoon. It's in yet. But they "presume" it's en route.

Air Technical Intelligence Center specialists will study the curious visitor before returning it to its owners, Mr. and Mrs. Hewlett Hodges of Sylacauga, Ala.

MEANWHILE, Hodges reported receiving at least 75 bids for the object, including one from the public museum. The highest bid so far, he said, is "an excess of $500" to the highest bidder.

Mrs. Hodges, who was struck on the hip and hand by the stone when it hurtled into her home Tuesday, remained in a Sylacauga hospital, recovering from bruises and nervous shock.

ROUND TRIP
Alabama's Star Now 
Closer To Housewife

WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 - (NEA) -
The "transient" meteorite which fell from the skies 10 days ago and landed in Alabama is now closer to the housewife's kitchen than the Democratic Rep. Kenneth A. Roberts of Alabama and Brig. Gen. Joe W. Kelly, director of the Air Force public information office.
Brig. Gen. Kelly said the Air Force had taken possession of the meteorite and is responsible for its safekeeping. He said the Air Force had "established a claim" to the meteorite, lest it fall from the skies again.
Mrs. Hodges, whose husband has tentatively identified the object "as the highest ever known to hit the earth," said several "fantastic offers to buy it" have been received, ranging from $2,500 to $5,000.
In keep the meteorite from its original owners, the Hodgeses, the Air Force has now transported the meteorite from its landing place in Sylacauga, Ala., Dec. 3 - and has whisked it off to the Eglin Air Force Base. The meteorite has not been seen by the Hodgeses since that day.
The Air Force now has the object and several scientists in other branches of the armed services are studying it. The object is being studied at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

When John Donoho raced to the Washington for scientific research. The museum, located in Tuscumbia, says it wants the meteorite for display research purposes. Mrs. Hodges, who obviously is a pretty woman, says she wants the meteorite merely to preserve it in the good old American fashion, as a souvenir to talk about when folks drop in.
She merely wants to preserve it. in the manner of the good Old American fashion, as a souvenir to talk about when folks drop in.
But the Museum demands now that they have possession of this meteorite, perhaps some kind of a compromise can be worked out whereby the Air Force can get a sample of the meteorite for its research, and Mrs. Hodges. in return, can keep what is left, which she might be willing to send it to the museum occasionally, say on alternates. But it must well be explained to her the law of the land; any meteorite or falling star shall belong to said person who first finds it.

Ex-Daytonian Seeks
Mrs. Hodges' Meteor

By BETTY A. DIETZ
Daily News Staff Writer

When "Mrs. Hodges" meteorite which "fell on Alabama" will wind up in the custody of the Evansville Institute of Arts and Sciences.

For Dr. Stanton Weng, former director of the Evansville Institute, said Monday he will seek the nine-pound meteorite made by the former housewife, Mrs. Hodges.

Mrs. Hodges' husband was blinded by the blow, it is believed to be the only person who was ever hit by a meteorite, according to the Smithsonian. The rock was delivered Monday to the Wright-Patterson Air Force base near Dayton, O. for the U.S. Air Technical Intelligence center officials.

WENG SAID the meteor is of scientific interest for two reasons: first, many have been hit by meteors before Mrs. Hodges was the first to survive, and second, the rock may substantiate the theory that the core of meteors is very cold.

When R. Malcolm Keck, president of the Evansville museum, talked to Mrs. Hodges she was uncertain whether the meteor had been sold. Mrs. Hodges told Kech the rock would be given to the Evansville museum, according to Weng.

Acquisition of the meteor should be a public effort, Weng said, adding that he is convinced the museum which has an all-public participation, is now raising funds for new quarters. We were given the address of Mrs. Hodges in Washington, D.C. and are attempting to get in touch with her, Weng said.
