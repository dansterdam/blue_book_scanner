AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

Dir/Intelligence, CALC                 TR-9-53                 Page 2     of 2

On 27 January 1953, LA HORA, Panama Spanish language daily, printed the following:

"HAVE YOU SEEN THE FLYING SAUCER...?"

On 17 January 1953 this paper received information that a Flying Disk was seen in the early morning hours over Aguadulce. A reporter of this paper from Chiriqui interviewed a local Capital City journalist who was traveling at the time, and who claimed to have seen, without intense brilliance, without the appearance of any known aircraft. This information, seen by the reporter, and not by the writer, claims that while traveling from publication until today so that the aerial defense of the Panama Canal could be previously alerted.

In an interview with Julio E. PATRUÑO, Director of the newspaper, it was learned that the picture (Enclosure 3) [partially redacted text]

[Several lines of text are redacted]

The Reporting Officer read a report from [redacted] that three were other witnesses who also did not clearly see about 0530, 19 January 1953, near Santa Los Sucias Hill and residents of the village of Peral also reported sighting similar or the same object.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER: [partially redacted] is well known for printing news that will create interest and sensation.

The man assigned the job of illustrating a flying saucer knew so little about photography that he tried to illuminate an object of intense brilliance by covering a white spot on a negative rather than making a black spot.

It is possible that the whole story is fiction. The editors of the local papers Foal that the Public Information Officer at Caribbean Air Command should have released the last similar incident, reported in TR-70-52, to the local news. Their first knowledge of this report came via a Drew Pearson syndicated column. There appears to be some resentment at being scooped.

A esta redacción han llegado informes de que a paratos no identificados se vieron el Lunes 19
en la madrugada cerca de la población de Aguadulce. - Mientras un redactor de este periódico
se dirigía de la ciudad de Chitré hacia esta capital, pudo observar un aparato a gran velocidad
igual que con inmensa brillantez cruzaba el espacio, sin tener las apariencias de nave aérea conocida. - Este fenómeno impresionó de manera particular a nuestro redactor y corresponsal
quien no queriendo alarmar demasiado en receso y esta información a que hoy se da la publicidad
para que las defensas aéreas del Canal de Panamá informen sobre este suceso.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Voladores
En Aguadulce

LA HORA
DIARIO POPULAR
MARTES 27 DE ENERO DE 1953

At the top right corner, there is also a notation: AF 480 327

The rest of the page appears to be mostly blank or too faded/low contrast to read clearly.


- page 6 -

Text found in the document:

Platillos Volados
Vistos En Agua

(VEA PAGINA 9)

There is also a small logo or symbol in the top right corner that appears to read "LA MA"

The document contains a faint photograph or image in the center, which appears to be an oval or circular shape, but the details are very indistinct.


- page 7 -

The only clearly legible text in this image is at the top left corner:

ATIC 1092916B

The rest of the document appears to be a very faint, low-contrast black and white document with folded or creased edges, but the text is too illegible to read.


- page 8 -

The image appears to be a very low-quality, grayscale scanned document with significant noise and degradation. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor scan quality. There is a faint outline of what seems to be a mountainous or hilly landscape at the bottom of the page, but no clear text can be discerned.
