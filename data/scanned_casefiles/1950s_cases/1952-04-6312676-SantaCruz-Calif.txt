April 16th, 1952.

Dear [redacted],

Got set for a rather odd deal and you can do as you see fit with what I'm about tell you and so help me, it's one McCoy.

One of our shooters recently left the club temporarily and insisted that I keep his Argus 20x spotting scope for him until next Tuesday, so I gladly took it over not having one of my own. Last Tuesday evening we were favored with an exceptionally clear atmosphere and as the first stars began to appear my pseudo - scientific urge came to the fore and I mounted the afore said scope on a tripod, and while waiting for complete darkness to set in I studied myself by watching the formation of heavy (numerous?) from territory. They maneuvered over Santa Cruz for possibly 30 minutes and then returned to their base.

There was still a faint light in the west and I began to work on a group of stars just a little bit high and to the right of Uranus. I started to move the tripod to another position when I caught two very faint ovoid objects approaching from the southwest at a great terrific rate of speed. They crossed the entire horizon at about five or eight seconds and were gone from view. At first I thought they were jets, altho there weren't any flying lights visible, and waited for the next. No such "nothing". Completely blank, only by the tintinnabulations of my alcoholic heart as it tried to skip out under my seventh rib.

I've made several checks on light conditions, star positions, relative distances and stuff every evening since then, and those given would approximate a two inch diameter at fifty feet, or slightly smaller. Color, to mine gray, phosphorescent and barely flickering. Speed, as fifteen hundred to 2000 ft altitude, 900 to 7 or 8 m.p.h.

But, if they had been in our interested atmosphere surely they would have seen, or a quick or sound wave, and if they were way out beyond they must have been of tremendous size and their speed would have been well up in the thousands.

Now, I can't make out a drawing man my case, account of its increase with my showing you nothing. I can by 100 1.00 yrs. notice for the price of a fifth or two, poor grade stuff, and waking up in the morning without a hangover is well worth it, so you can see the value is totally color-proof.

I haven't said anything here as I don't want to be quoted off by anyone in a crazy news-would. Besides, the school teacher who lives in the front apartment and more than to secrecy, but this morning I heard over the radio that

the Aich Pose had sighted several of these critters near
Las Vegas yesterday. I saw mine Tuesday evening, April 15,
at about 7:40 P.M.

I'm sending you a rough casting of my impression
of these sightings, and you can make a little experiment if
you wish. This represents a view of my group as one
looks due west. Now make this picture in your right hand
end hold it as far to the left, as you can reach, keep your
eyes on the light spots, now swing the picture as far
as you can to the right away, so back of "Hill," facing
there is to it, that's the way I saw it. My Group.

If you think your outfit would be interested in
what I've written you're welcome to give it to them. If not,
it is yours for whatever you choose to do with it. For
my part, I know enough to couple or block, say, any
I'm sure, so we - up and cast aside cold, tea and then
many cigarets.

Hoping you are the same

yours narcotic two.
