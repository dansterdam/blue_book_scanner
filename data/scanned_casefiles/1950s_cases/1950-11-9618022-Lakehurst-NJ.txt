2. As indicated in the attached letter (Para 1) no definite conclusions can be reached on the information presented. However, it has been the experience of this office that observations in the air especially at night are often very deceiving even to the most experienced observers.

3. A check of the files in this office reveals no other reports which add anything to the report in question with regard to both the time and location involved. Request the matter be investigated by your office to determine whether any other persons reported similar observations which would coincide from the standpoint of time and general location.

1.   The enclosed report is forwarded to your department for analysis and comment. It is probable that a definite conclusion cannot be reached from the facts presented in the report.

2.   The nature of the observation suggests a possibility of the object being a lighted balloon. However, this explanation was exploded when LJUG Haven was interviewed by Lt. Technical Capabilities Branch. LJUG Haven stated that jet fighters had made intercepts on his aircraft on many occasions. He stated that the light had appeared much greater than a jet fighter. It appeared to circle his aircraft at a terrific rate of speed, even when climbing. The rate of climb was estimated to be over 2000 feet per minute. Therefore, it would not be possible to class this incident as a lighted weather balloon, if the description is considered accurate.

3.   It is requested that this report be reviewed and evaluation forwarded to this Headquarters.

Subj: Encounter with strange phenomena while night flying

1. While on a routine night radar navigation flight from NAS Atlantic City on the night of 7 November 1950, the following incident took place. I was flying an AD-4Q, returning from seaward, and homing in on NAS Lakehurst. As we approached Lakehurst at approximately 5,500 feet, I became aware of a single steady white light to my starboard about five (5) miles, which I judged to be another aircraft's fuselage light. This light was slightly above me, at about 4,000 feet and moving in a southeasterly direction at approximately my airspeed or slightly greater. Because of the steady light, I believed this was another military aircraft operating from Lakehurst or Atlantic City and instructed my crewman to switch our radar to "intercept" so we could test out this part of our gear before returning to base. The time was 1915, as we were due to land at 1930. Then I pulled up in a slight climbing turn in order to get on this object's tail. The visibility was extremely excellent with no overcast, and with all the stars and planets showing brightly, it was no effort to discern the motion of this object because of the background of stars. After rolling out on this object's course, it turned a little more southerly and seemed to settle down somewhat. I was directly behind it, still somewhat lower. In less time that it takes to tell, this light, without making any kind of reversal turn, bore down on me in a slight dive, passing directly over my canopy, at an incredible speed, about 100 to 200 feet above. Puzzled at this, my first reaction was that I had originally met some other aircraft without running lights and that it had been a close miss for both of us. Informing my crewman of what took place, he disregarded his radar operation and proceeded to witness the following events. I then pulled into a tight "flipper" reversal turn in order to see this light again. As before, it was still slightly higher than I, and this time I was positive we were on his tail. Pushing to normal rated power and climbing, I attempted to hold the light in front of me, this object made another hard on pass, veering slightly port and below so that my crewman could see it too. Now with nothing but a single white light, close to 10 to 12 inches in diameter, it moved with fantastic speed. Since we were close to Lakehurst, about five (5) miles north, I tried contacting their tower twice on 142.74 mcs. with no response. Still engaging in this cat and mouse game with this light, and recalling that our own squadron had some jets and other AD's

airborne, I switched to our squadron common frequency, and requested assistance from any "confine" aircraft in the vicinity. The Commanding Officer and his wingman in two F9F's answered, and set course for Lakehurst, NJ meanwhile, after five (5) to six (6) passes, this object and I got into a port orbit. I frequently checked by instruments for altitude and engine limitations, and flew in a 60Â° climbing brk, indicating 130-135 kts. This light continued to turn about me in wider climbing turns, making about two orbits to my one. At 11,500 feet I abandoned the chase and simply orbited in order to keep the object in sight. Then the Commanding Officer reported over McGuire AFB at 11,000 feet I turned my lights on "Dim" to "Bright", reporting we were still in a port orbit, but I estimated the object's height at about 18,000 feet still climbing in a wide orbit and growing dimmer, by the time they arrived over me, the object still appeared, though faint, at about 25,000 feet. All this took place in a period of 25 to 30 minutes, and at the Commanding Officer's suggestion we returned to base. The Commanding Officer never did sight the light, but his wingman did.

Having had experience with jets against conventional in "Dog Fights", I have a good idea of their speed, but this object in the encounter described previously was making at least twice the speed, or approximately 600 kts. While it was possible, I tried hard to distinguish a shape or form of wing or airfoil, but could see nothing; but this white light. Pulling up even more after it passed, I tried to see if I could hit its wash or slipstream, but there was none. Only this single steady white light that could move with phenomenal speed and maneuverability.
