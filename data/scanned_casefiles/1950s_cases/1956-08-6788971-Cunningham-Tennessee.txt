SUMMARY (Enter concise summary of report.  Give significance in first narrative paragraph.  List indicators or lower left.  Begin text of report on AF Form 118a.)

A UFOB report was made by Post Supervisor of 06324 Ned, Cunningham, Tennessee on 9, 10, and 11 August 1956.

The object was reported as being red when still or hovering and yellow when moving.

The size varied; when still it appeared the size of a softball and the size of 20 ft diameter when moving.

Sound of the object was similar to that of a helicopter, but not like that of an airplane engine.

Sound could only be heard when object was moving and stopped when object stopped.

The report relayed to ADC (ADDC) 416 J. BYERS told the Filter Center instructor to forget about the report since radar had nothing in the area.
