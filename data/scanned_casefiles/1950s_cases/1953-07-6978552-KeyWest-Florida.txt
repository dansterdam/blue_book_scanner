24 July 1953                                UNCLASSIFIED                   Key West, Florida

Description

Between the hours of 2200 and 2230 EST, a student at the Fleet Sonar School, United States Naval Base, Key West, Florida, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over the town of Key West. The object appeared to be approximately the size of a pin point or a star, very bright white in color, proceeded rapidly from low on the western sky line to a point directly forward and overhead. The object then blinked out momentarily before descending below the eastern skyline. No aerodynamic features, trail, exhaust, propulsion system, or sound were noted. Speed was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object's true size or its distance from him. The observer stated that the object appeared to move in regular smooth circles.

Discussion

Inquiry was made as to the observer's general reputation and character. His supervisor in Sonar Operations stated that he had no knowledge of the observer except during duty hours. The supervisor gave him a character rating of "very good," "above reproach," and described him as a quiet, conscientious, good student - not outstanding but above average. The interviewer stated that the observer appeared to be stable, well-adjusted, and very consistent with his answers after considerable questioning.

The weather at the time of the observation was reported as a broken overcast. Clouds were reported to be solid to the west where the object disappeared. A check with CAA office of U.S. Weather Bureau at Boca Chica Key reveals a ceiling of 22,300 feet.

There were several aircraft in the area and one of them was equipped with a searchlight. There is a possibility that the observer saw the searchlight scanning the area.

Conclusion

Other - Probably searchlight on aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM Wing Intelligence Office    REPORT NO 7
156th Tg Gp (W)                 PAGE 2 of 4 PAGES
ATIA, Miami, Florida

1. Report follows of the information obtained by this office in compliance with message AFOIN-ATIAB-7-25-B from the Commander, ATIC, Wright Patterson AFB. Delay in reporting was caused by inability to contact the observer due to the message daring between 1 August 1953, the time concerned in arranging for a definite time and place for interviewing the observer, and the need for coordinating available transportation consistent with the scheduled commitments of this wing in moving to Charleston, South Carolina. Contact cooperation was extended by all levels of command contacted, both Air Force and Navy, in order to insure completion of the investigation. Pertinent information is submitted in the order established by paragraph 7a, AFR 200-2.

a. Only one object was sighted on each occasion. It was very bright white in color but so small that the observer stated he could just barely see it. It was reported to be about the size of a pin point or a star of ordinary size and luminance. No aerodynamic features, trail, exhaust, propulsion system, or sound were observed. Speed was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object's true size or its distance from him. It was reported to have traversed an angle of 120° from west to east in the one and one half minutes during the first sighting on 24 July 1953 and 60° in approximately forty seconds during the second sighting on 1 August 1953. The object took a course of slight course, vertically, from west to east; however the individual course was said to have been observed and both occasions. These maneuvers, or changes of course, were described as lateral 15° angular legs, or zig zags, along the vertical course and level or lateral circles. The observer was insistent that the individual track legs were from 2 to 3 miles in tracking, and at the same angles, and that they varied from side to side along the vertical course. As reported to the interviewing officer, these changes in course can be most accurately described as the type of course described when tracking a missile, with altitude, deflection, or zig zags, or turns, were described as regular, smooth, and all of the same type. A graphic description of these maneuvers is included as enclosure 1.

b. On 24 July 1953 at approximately 2100 EST, the object blinking out and reappearing four or five times. On 1 August 1953, it disappeared but was believed that an illusion of reverting the effects of perspective when observing a circle made by the observer. Observers were certain the object's course on 24 July and 1 August was very bright during the entire observation at 24 July 1953.

b. For 24 July and 1 August the times of sighting were reported to be between 2200 and 2230 EST and at 2135 EST, respectively. Converted to Z time these would be 0300 to 0330 and 0235. The first sighting lasted for approximately one and one half minutes and the second for approximately one minute. Estimates were checked by the interviewing officer and found to be consistent with his estimates.

c. Both observations were made visually from the surface with the naked eye. The observer states he does not wear glasses and claims to have 20/20 eyesight.

d. Observer was standing on the porch of his landlady's house at 624 Wilkinson Street, Key West, according to 30° N, 81° W. Observer stated that he was a civilian employee at the submarine base, Key West, and his

DATE OF REPORT: 5 August 1953

FROM (Agency): Wing Intelligence Section
656th Trp Carr W2 (M), MIA, Miami, Fla.

PREPARED BY (Officer): 1st Lt DONALD J. TWOMBLY
SOURCE: Military Observer

SUMMARY:
On 24 July and 1 August 1953 Seaman Apprentice [redacted], a student at the Fleet Sonar School, United States Naval Base, Key West, Florida, observed an aerial object in the sky over the town of Key West. The first sighting was between 2200 and 2230 EST and the second was at 2135 EST. The object appeared to be about the size of a pin point or a star, was very bright white in color. On 24 July it proceeded rapidly from low on the western skyline to a point directly forward and overhead. On 1 August it appeared at the same point on the horizon but was obscured by clouds at the zenith of its flight path. No mechanical characteristics were noted. The object made no sound. The military visual observation was not observed to modify a regular arc vertically. The observer does not appear to be extremely extroverts, appeared to be very stable, and desires no publicity rather, he, at times, gave the impression of him wishing to be checked against his own sighting.

This addendum is made only to note that the observer appeared to have been skeptical of his own sighting and checked it against whatever known data were available to him with the result that he decided he had seen some object with which he was not familiar.

At no time did he exhibit any excitement about the sighting. He gave
the impression that he wanted to be very exact in his answers and give
precise data for all aspects of his observation. He stated he had
mentioned the sighting to any newspapers and he would not trust them to
give a true version of his account, nor to protect him from public ridi-
cule. He asked for and received permission to call the interviewing

north-south line and that he attempted to maintain a check on the flight path by this method throughout the observation. On this basis, he noted the object was noticed first due west at approximately 30° above the horizon and immediately above the sky line which was formed by trees surrounding the house. It proceeded generally due east, except for the maneuvers described in paragraph b above. No estimate of the distance or height was attempted by the observer since, he stated, he did not know the true size of the object. He stated the object did not travel as fast as a meteor.

a. The observer stated that on 24 July he was accompanied by his wife and that he called his landlady, a Mrs. [illegible name], out of the house to watch the object. On 1 August he was alone when he first noticed the object and called his wife, Mrs [illegible name] and Mrs [illegible name] out to time the object again. The three women were not interested due to the limitations of the observation.

Approximately [illegible] is a student at the Fleet Sonar School, Key West. He enlisted on 9 October 1952. His parent's home is at [illegible]. Chaster, Pennsylvania and he lives with his wife. He has been married approximately six months. He has no children or dependents other than his wife. He was born on 11 July 1931 and is 22 years old. He completed two years of schooling at La Salle College, Philadelphia, where he majored in English literature and minored in language and government. He has worked during summer vacations as a life guard, life guard supervisor, and he was employed in the maintenance department of La Salle, during his academic years, as a general maintenance worker. He is fairly familiar with astronomy, claiming to be able to recognize a few major constellations, but he stated he is not interested in astronomy beyond that. He is strongly interested in flying, believing that some type of flying objects might exist but that he is not very concerned; and is not worried about the possibility of the phenomenon. He was emphatic in declaring the object did not resemble any known aircraft. He stated that since before, in the summer of 1949, while he was a student at La Salle, he first noticed an object which was described as a metallic, flash first observed as stationary or moving, and then sighted at a 45 angle and disappearing after a very smooth but quick maneuver.

23 November 1953

Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just not gotten down to looking over the large batch of accumulated reports. I must say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these approaches that incident in interest. There are a few interesting sightings, but none of these is information sufficient to make a follow-up profitable.

Of the interesting ones, the very similar sightings of 24 July and 1 August at Key West would warrant follow-up if they were more recent. With present information, I have no suggested explanation.

The 25 July Perrin AFB Texas also holds possible interest from the standpoint of maneuvers and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by civilians of Dennison, Texas.

It is too bad there is not more information on Creole, Ala. These cases cover four separate days. There is possibly pay dirt in these.

Finally, the Sidi Slimane sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain on the books as unexplained.

As for the remaining 30 or so, there is so little information coming through that I have only cursory explanations that there is no percentage whatever in considering them seriously.

Thus, out of the total number there are 4 independent sets which, if staff and time were available, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I vote for sticking with the Black Hawk case until it is explained. If this case can be explained, others would follow suit.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, we are proceeding slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence. Since the observations covered several hours and sightings were both visual and radar, it is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this case. Failure to identify pinpoints a possible real weakness in our defense set-up. I hope to have a preliminary report on this case soon.
