Description
Between the hours of 2200 and 2230 EST, a student at the Fleet Sonar School, located at Key West, Florida, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over the town of Key West. The object appeared to be approximately the size of a pin point or a star, very bright white in color, proceeded rapidly from low in the western sky to the zenith, The object was observed to blink on and off and it showed variations in the rate of its apparent motion. Its dynamic features, trail, exhaust, pulsation system, etc. could not be determined due to the object's true size and or its distance from the observer. The observer stated that the object disappeared and moved in a regular, smooth motion.

Discussion
Inquiry was made as to the observer's general reputation and character. The observer was interviewed and stated that he had no previous experience with such phenomena and it gave him a "character rating of 'very good'." The observer indicated - not outstanding but above average. The interviewer stated that the observer appeared to be a sincere and honest individual with his answers after considerable questioning.

The weather at the time of the observation was reported as a broken overcast. Clouds were reported to be solid to the west where the object disappeared. A ceiling of 12,000 feet was reported by U.S. Weather Bureau at Rome-Chico Key seven. A sighting of 22,300 feet.

There were several aircraft in the area and one of them was equipped with a searchlight. There is a probability that the observer saw the searchlight.

Conclusion
Other - Probably searchlight on aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency) W124 Intelligence Office
LOCATION Key West, Florida (CN)
REPORT NO. 7
PAGE 2 OF 4 PAGES

SUBJECT: Information obtained by this Command concerning sighting of unidentified aerial objects.

1. On 26 July 1953, the Commander, ATIC, Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, was notified by ATIC that a delay in the progress of this investigation was being caused by information contained in the previous intelligence report received on Saturday, 25 July 1953. The time consumed in arranging for investigators and the time need for coordination.

2. This case had been filed for investigation and the investigator had been dispatched when on 26 July 1953 a telephone call was received from ATIC stating that the object sighted was, in all probability, a searchlight reflection or some other common and easily explainable phenomena, and that the investigator should be recalled.

3. Accordingly, on 27 July 1953 the investigator was recalled and the investigation terminated with the following pertinent information submitted in the order established by para. 7b, 20 July 1953:

a. Only one object was sighted on each occasion. It was very dim and seemed to waver in motion. The sighting was just barely noticeable. It was reported to be about the size of a pinpoint or a star of ordinary size and luminance. No characteristics or dimensions are reported, since the observer did not know the object.

b. The object was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object. Sightings were made at 23:20 and 23:55, 24 July 1953, and lasted approximately 10-15 seconds during the second sighting on 1 August 1953.

c. No other objects were observed in conjunction with the sightings. These sightings apparently are identical with those described in ATIC message 0024, 26 July 1953.

d. The individual sightings appeared to be of the same size, distance, duration, and at the same geographical location, which was observed to be approximately over the Key West NAS.

e. As reported to the interviewing officers, there were no changes in course or speed, since the object(s) remained stationary during the entire period of observation.

f. The object, as it appeared to the observer, was very dim and just barely perceptible. Evaluation indicates that it could have been a reflection of some sort, such as a searchlight or the moon reflecting off a high cirrus cloud in the area. No unusual maneuvering or sound was observed.

g. Attached as inclosure 1 is a diagram prepared by the observer showing the position and course of the object as observed on both occasions.
 
h. No photograph was obtained of the object.

i. On 1 August 1953, the observer obtained an impression that the object's course on 24 July 1953 was from the N to the S, and on 1 August 1953 was from the W to the E. However, this impression may be unreliable, and the object's course is actually unknown.

j. For 24 July and 1 August the times of sightings were reported to be 23:20 and 23:55, respectively.

k. The angles of elevation for the sightings were not determined.

APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: FLYOBJECT
PLACE: KEY WEST FLORIDA - KEY WEST 
DATE: 5 AUGUST 1953
PREPARED BY: DONALD J. TIMBLY

SUMMARY: (Omit the detail necessary to report. Give impressions in usual well-organized paragraph. Limit narrative to 1 sheet, single side of report (on AF Form 112âPart I).

On 24 July and 1 August 1953 two apprentice training students assigned to the Naval Station at Key West, Florida, observed and reported a flyobject maneuvering in the sky at about 2220 and 2330 EST and the second was at 2135 EST. The object appeared to be about the size of a small aircraft and maneuvered with a high rate of speed and a rapid change of direction. No trail or exhaust was observed. The object emitted a bright light and appeared to be controlled and even under intelligent guidance. No sound was heard and the observer does not believe the object to have been a meteor or aircraft in flight.

Technical characteristics were not noted. The object was never closer than about one mile and therefore, detailed characteristics could not be observed to modify a regular report. The observer does not appear to be excited or over-imaginative and seems sincere and truthful in his statements.

This experience had common features upon the report other than to note that the observer appears unusually well-balanced and reliable in his evaluation of his own sighting and checked it against whatever object with which he was not familiar. The object with which he was not acquainted was not familiar to him and therefore, he made a factual report as he observed it.

PAGE 4 OF 4 PAGES

The interview continued and he was conversing more easily as the end-to-end process data he had observed about his sightings was discussed in detail. He gave precise data for all aspects of his observation. He stated he had not consulted the witness or anyone else and his account and his opinions he would not relate to the public media. 

The weather and winds aloft conditions at time and place of sightings were as follows:

24 July 
Observer: reported a "broken overcast" which cleared up sufficiently to leave just of the sky clear. Clouds were reported as solid to the west and overcast at about 5,000 feet. Surface winds were 230 degrees 8 knots, aloft 270 degrees 15 knots, peak velocity to 25 knots. 

4 August
Weather: Observer reported a heavy overcast stretching from the eastern horizon to the southeast at about 10/10ths. Winds aloft 280 degrees 55 knots, decreasing to 300 degrees 47 knots. Winds at surface 240 degrees 11 knots.

No unusual activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, was reported or discovered which might account for the sightings.

No evidence of any physical evidence of the sightings was reported or discovered.

No official investigation or identification action was taken.

The reliability of this observer is considered high. The observer showed he has had experience with aviation and holds a responsible position with the Air Force at MIA., Miami, Florida, and began operations at Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, as a weather observer.

The report describes an incident on July 24, 1952 where an observer attempted to maintain a check on the flight path of an unknown object that was noticed by trees surrounding a house. The observer stated the object did not travel as fast as a meteor and estimated its size to be about 30 feet in diameter. The observer was accompanied by his wife and another person at the time. 

The report also mentions that the observer was a resident of Key West, Florida and had no background in astronomy. He stated he was not interested in astronomy, but would like to make a career. The report provides additional details about the sighting and the observer's account.

The document also mentions an inquiry made regarding the observer's general reputation and character, which was described as being "good" and "conscientious". Overall, the document appears to be a detailed report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object in Key West, Florida on July 24, 1952.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just now gotten down to looking over the large batch of accumulated reports related to the interesting incidents of 21 July and 1 August of this year. The details and following of these cases are more recent.

With present information I have no suggested explanation. 

The details of the sightings are consistent with the observations from the standpoint of maneuvers and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by military personnel. However, there is not more information on these cases than four immediate days. There is probably additional pay dirt in these cases.

It is true there is not more information on Creole, Ala. These cases cover four immediate days. There is probably pay dirt in these cases.

Finally, the did slinmane sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain on the books as unexplained.

As for the remaining 39 or so cases there is so little information concerning those which do not have obvious explanations that there is no pertinent information to include.

Thus, out of the total number there are 8 independent sets which, if staff and time were adequate, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I vote for sticking with the Black Hawk case until we have squeezed it dry. I hope others would follow suit.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, we are proceeding slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence and radar. It is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this case fully until a satisfactory and substantial solution is achieved in our defense set-up. I hope to have a preliminary report on this case for you soon.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek

The image contains three sketches depicting different perspectives of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a shape above it to illustrate how high the object was above the horizon when the witness first saw it.

The second and third sketches provide a larger view of the object's position relative to the observer. The second sketch shows the object's position when the witness first saw it, and the third sketch is a smaller example of how the larger sketch could be completed to show the full extent of the object's position.

Text Transcription:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Rather to scale the sketch as an example of how it could complete the larger sketch.
