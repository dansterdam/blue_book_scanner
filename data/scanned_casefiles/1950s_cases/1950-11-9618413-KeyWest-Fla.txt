SIXTH ENDORSEMENT on FANTULANT Restricted aerial msg 968 of
21 November 1950

From: Commanding Officer, Fleet Air Weather Training Unit, Atlantic
To: Chief, Technical Analysis Division, Intelligence Department,
Hdqtrs AMC, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio

Subj: Unidentified aircraft reported 14, 15 November 1950

1. In answer to request for information contained in the first
endorsement under paragraph (a):

a. With regard to size and shape, the pip was slightly smaller
than that of a B-50. The intensity of the pip was very weak similar
to that of an F-80.

b. No track is available as the radar pips were very weak and
only noticeable while maneuvering in the vicinity of CGI intercepts.
The aircraft was probably making runs on the Interceptor which was
flying with his warning light on. It has been found through experience
with this ground radar that jets are usually unobservable while
approaching or returning on a straight course, but show up quite well
during the steep turns incident to making runs on a propeller driven
aircraft which is being tracked.

c. Model SK General purpose search radar with a frequency of
2870 M.C.

4. AN/APS-6 airborne intercept radar (x band).

e. Negative, the F6F-5N that made the visual contact was the
blacked out target for the F6F-5N that made the radar contact. A
momentary video contact was made on the unidentified aircraft by the
Interceptor F6F-5N slightly before being sighted by the target F6F-5N.
Momentary contacts were made by the ground radar over a period of
about 9 minutes.

5. No surface targets, ship or land, were in the vicinity.

A. Under paragraph (b), the following is submitted:

a. Same as answer a, b, and f above.

b. (Item with good visibility at 15,000 feet where contacts occurred.

c. Momentary contact was made, but not enough of a track or pattern observed to be able to attempt an intercept.

d. No GCI was attempted due to the limitations explained in 1 b, above.

e. Evaluation of the appearance of the radar pip plus the speed involved led the GCI controller to believe that the unidentified target involved was a jet type aircraft of the approximate configuration of a B-45. This view was concurred in by the pilots involved. The only thing observed that was unconventional was the lack of lights on an aircraft, passing through the airspace warning area.

SYNOPSIS
Three Officers of the 374th Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McGlellan Air Force Base, McGlellan, California, reported sighting what appeared to be a rocket at 0240 hours Central Time, 1840 hours Pacific Standard Time, on 18 November 1949.

From an aircraft flying at an altitude of 18,000 feet, the object was sighted at approximately 49 degrees north latitude, 141 degrees west longitude, traveling on a slight descent, at a great rate of speed on a heading of 270 degrees. When first observed it was at an altitude of approximately 19,000 feet and disappeared in a layer of clouds with tops at 14,000 feet. The object appeared to leave a trail of fire about 50 feet in length, and 40 feet in diameter, and was in view for approximately 10 seconds. No unusual disturbances in radio transmission or reception. Radar not operating at time of sighting.

AT MC CLELLAN AIR FORCE BASE, MC CLELLAN, CALIFORNIA

2. On 21 November 1949, First Lieutenant, Weather Observer Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McClellan Air Force Base, McClellan, California, made the following statement relative to an unusual sighting on 18 November 1949:

"Friday November 18th 1949 on Lark Dog mission, I sighted what appeared to be a rocket, at approximately position 12, 49 degrees north, 141 degrees west. We were flying approximately 18,000 feet at 0240 GCT. We sighted what appeared to be a rocket crossing in front of the aircraft traveling at a great rate of speed. It appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 19,000 feet traveling at a slight descent on heading of 270 degrees. I called the object to the attention of the pilot, co-pilot, and the engineer, the object then appeared into the layer of altocumulus clouds, the tops which were about 14,000 feet in altitude. It was leaving a trail of fire which appeared to be about 50 feet in length and 40 feet in diameter, and gave the appearance of being followed by a ball of fire. The flame was white in color. The object was traveling at such a rate of speed it could not be estimated. The object appeared to be 1 mile distance as it passed our aircraft."

3. On 21 November 1949, First Lieutenant, Pilot, Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McClellan Air Force Base, McClellan, California, made the following statement relative to an unusual sighting on 18 November 1949:

"On Lark Dog mission 18 November 1949, 1840 hours Pacific Time, I observed what appeared to be either a rocket or a meteorite descending gradually on a generally westerly heading. The object was traveling at a great rate of speed and trailing a flame which was extremely bright. Its precise size were difficult to judge because its distance from us could not be estimated accurately. It dispersed to what appeared to be our same altitude or slightly lower and either burned out or disappeared into a layer of clouds."

4. On 21 November 1949, First Lieutenant, Pilot, Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McClellan Air Force Base, McClellan, California, made the following statement relative to an unusual sighting on 18 November 1949:

"On the 18th of November 1949 during a routine Lark Dog Weather mission, I witnessed an unusual sight.

At about 1840 hours Pacific Time in the evening, a brilliant light arose through the sky from a heading of approximately 270°.

The aircraft, at the time, was on a heading of 140° flying on automatic pilot. Lt., the weather observer, was the first man to notice the unusual phenomena and called it. When I did notice me, I turned out the window, I saw a brilliant light shaped somewhat like a large cigar on a downward path heading toward the ocean, however in a few seconds (approximately 10 seconds) the light was abruptly extinguished.

I have no idea of what the light may have been. At first I thought it might have been a falling star, but the phenomena lasted such a long time and the light was so large in relation to falling stars or meteors I had seen, I dismissed the possibility of its being a star."

5. On 3 January 1950, Sergeant, Dropsond Operator, Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McClellan Air Force Base, McClellan, California, stated he had been on Lark Dog mission on 18 November 1949, but could give no information relative to the object sighted by Lieutenant.

NOTE: [Partially obscured text] position is located in the rear pressurized compartment of the aircraft. There are blisters located on both sides of the compartment and one on top, but no forward visibility.

6. On 13 January 1950, Staff Sergeant, Radio Operator, Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McClellan Air Force Base, McClellan, California, stated he had been on Lark Dog mission on 18 November 1949, but could give no information relative to the object sighted by Lieutenant. Stated further that there had been no unusual interference or disruption of radio transmission or reception during the flight.

1. This command has reviewed the included report and it is considered that the information regarding the radar detection of unidentified aircraft on the nights of 14 and 15 November 1950 appears to be possibly correct. However, there are some indications of weather effects entering into the detection of radar targets.

2. In general, insufficient information is contained in the attached report to allow a well-founded evaluation to be made of the radar targets. It is suggested that the source of the basic report be requested to submit another more complete and coordinated report. Answers to the following questions are desired:

a. 14 November 1950 Incident

(1) Did the radar scope pip of the unidentified target detected by the ground radar set resemble that of conventional aircraft? If so, what type or size conventional aircraft?

(2) Can a track of the unidentified target be supplied to this command? If not, give as complete details as possible regarding range and maneuvers of the target, and continuity of the radar target echoes.

(3) What type ground radar set was used to detect the target, particularly what was the frequency of the transmitter?

(4) What type radar set was used in the intercepting F6F-5N?

(5) Was the F6F-5N that made visual contact with an unidentified aircraft the same as the one that had previously made a radar contact? Also, was radar contact made on the sighted aircraft either before or after visual sighting by either the airborne radar in the F6F-5N or the ground radar?
