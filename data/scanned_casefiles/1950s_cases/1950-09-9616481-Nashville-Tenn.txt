Article Text:
NASHVILLE, Sept. 17 - (UP) - Residents here and at Cookeville more than 80 miles to the east reported seeing "bright orange streaks" or "balls of fire" in the sky shortly before dark Sunday.

From Cookeville, Livingston, and Buffalo Valley, all in the way to Nashville, farm and town folk craned their necks and speculated about the strange aerial display that appeared in the sky shortly before 6 p.m., moving to the Southwest.

Some said the flame colored streaks were rockets. Others thought they marked the trail of a plane. The more imaginative spoke of "flying saucers," and such. Skeptics said the sky was just playing tricks, that it was the reflection of the sun on cumulus cloud formations.

At any rate it wasn't an optical illusion. Hundreds of people stood in the street at Cookeville and neighboring towns to watch.

Among them was Everett Derry, president of Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, who was stumped like the rest.

Uniformly the heavenly phenomenon was described as for hours of orange-hued aerial lines of light, moving slowly (or maybe so high it just seemed slow) in a southwesterly direction.

Derry said weathermen could offer no precise explanation, but they weren't excited. "Probably reflection," they said.

WITNESSES AT THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN office saw the display at a great height and at a great distance. They settled on the jet plane explanation.

Among those who saw the show, one sentiment seemed to prevail - "In this day and time, perhaps, anything might happen."

Joe Mabry, manager of Radio Station WHIN at Cookeville, said he saw two parallel streaks traveling northwestward and said more than a dozen persons telephoned his station to report seeing the streaks and to inquire about them. Among the callers, he said, was Everette Derry, president of Tennessee Polytechnic.
