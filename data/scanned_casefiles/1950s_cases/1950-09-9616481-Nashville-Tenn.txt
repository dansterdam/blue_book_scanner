Streaks in Sky Mystify Middle Tennessee Observers
Middle Tennesseans were puzzled by unexplained streaks that disrupted the Sunday night sky. To some, it appeared to be "flying saucers." To others, it resembled "meteors." Whatever the cause, the phenomenon was witnessed by farm and town folk over a wide area.
Among them was Everett Derry, weatherman for a Nashville radio station. Describing the sight, he said, "they seemed to be heavenly phenomena - orange-hued parallel lines streaking across the sky."
Other weathermen could offer no explanation, but said "they reflected the light."
WITNESSESS and THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN said the streaks appeared at a "high altitude" and were "visible for a great distance." They settled on the jet-plane explanation.
Among those who saw the show, "one sentiment seemed to prevail - they would not have missed it for anything," the paper said.
