I can definitely say that it was no hallucinating, either lights, reflection or anything else that is visibly identifiable. I have read and read reports for years of these mysterious objects, and was hopeful as to their actual picture. Until I actually saw one myself.

In my opinion science will not then have facts. Full in trying to find out what these objects are.

P.S. See next page for off the record document.

Some professors, namely psychologists psychiatrists + some clear seers + possibly
writers have publicly admitted of frequent
reports to be something "are the mass
hysterics and/or hallucinations.
While some expo to my be clearing this
category, I seriously doubt that
the entire country is merely seeing things
that actually aren't there.
How we to tell could we have won
world war II with people all over mass hysterics
+ hallucinations!

Middletown Air Materiel Area                                   Intelligence Office
                                                                Olmsted Air Force Base, Middletown, Pa.
DATE OF REPORT

DATE OF OBSERVATION
2 August 1952

SOURCES
John L. Spiegel, 2d Lt, USAF
Civilian Observer

Air Force Letter No. 200-5, 29 Apr 52

Mr. [redacted], Marietta, Pa., reported observing
an unidentified flying object on 2 August at approximately 0853.

Mr. [redacted] first noticed the object while parked on a hill, approximately
one mile west of Marietta (7655N - 4005E). Mr. [redacted] noted that he noticed
a brilliant white light suddenly appearing at a point N.E. of his position.
According to Mr. [redacted], the object was traveling West to East, approximately
400 above and parallel to the horizon. He reported that the object maintained
a straight course without altering altitude or direction and suddenly vanished
in the East.

The object was physically described as a brilliant white light with a relative
size of approximately half the size of the moon. Mr. [redacted] could not observe any
exhaust or trail and could not report any sound as being heard. Although no
accurate estimate of altitude or speed could be given, the observer described the
object as traveling "very fast" and as being at a "low altitude."

The observation was collaborated by Mrs. [redacted], Marietta, Pa. Mrs. [redacted]'s location was approximately one mile
east of Mr. [redacted]. She reported observing an object at approximately 0100½. Mrs. [redacted]
description of the object was similar to that of Mr. [redacted] with the exception that she
observed the object to have been climbing at approximately a 45° angle. While she believed the size of the object she
believed the object to have been orange in color.

Mr. [redacted] educational background included a high school education and the
man may be described as having average intelligence. He served as a radio
operator with the USAF during World War II and has had some experience with air-
craft. Mrs. [redacted] background was not determined.

The weather at the time of the observation was clear, with 10-mile visibility.

This Office can offer no definite explanation for the sighting. The facts
given seem to rule out the possibility of aircraft or astronomical phenomena as be-
ing the explanation. (i.e., size of the object and its behavior).
