civilian defense people whom he knows quite well, to Bays Landing, and several other places which appear to have been South of the position of these objects, and who might have been able to furnish information as to what they looked like from that angle. None of these people had any information whatsoever on this incident, and was quite confident that if any observations had been made, the people contacted would have known about it.

The last piece of evidence I would like to bring in varies a great deal from all the other observations. was a pilot who lives near Toms River, was contacted by a friend that night to go out and see the unknown objects considered of above average reliability and an above average observer. He saw 12 objects.

He observed them for 5 minutes, during which time he says they were flying in a left-hand circle formation. (He has drawn this on his Form A.) Their color was orange, their shape was round or slightly oval, they would stand still at times and then would speed up, always keeping in the circle. He estimates their speed at between 2 and 3 thousand mph, and their distance at 2½ miles at 2000' or 70 miles at 50 - 60 thousand feet. When we contacted again at Lakehurst NAS, Capt. Hanson asked if he had any further information to add, either as to additional data gathered or in the way of opinions on the subject. replied that he had no further information not stated on the Form A, and that if we wanted any opinions, that was just too bad, as he didn't want to "end up in a strait-jacket."

This same general type of opinion was voiced by all the other observers. That is, that these objects were frightening, awesome, that they were glad when they went away, and they don't want to ever see them again.

shows the objects as they disappeared in the South West. The objects
hovered in the south for about an hour, not covering much area of the
sky. One object would remain stationary and the other two would cir-
cle around it; then one of the circling ones would assume the central
position and the other two would circle (a game of ring around the
saucer! no doubt.) At approximately midnight, the objects streaked
off suddenly to the south-west, disappearing because of fading and
distance, apparently, and becoming smaller as they disappeared.

went to his point of observation. Figure C shows the three objects as
he observed them, looking due south out of the top window of the police
station. evidence was the same as the and the
and the other people on Drive. His observations were
intermittent, as he was on desk duty that night and had to keep running
back and forth to answer phone calls, some of which were from people
wanting to know what "those lights" were.

The longest time anyone saw the objects from Toms River was an hour
and a half, which is what the police chief said was his total time.
Actually, no new evidence was uncovered in talking to these people, except
that it was definitely brought out that these things could not have been
searchlights. Mr. of has had a great deal of ex-
perience with searchlights in WW2 a/a work. There was general agreement
that if there had been any cloud cover, that these objects could have been
likened to a searchlight beam reflected off a cloud base. However, the
night was perfectly clear and starry, with no cloud whatsoever. The objects
were round or oval, they were a white or off-white color, glowing, with

Report to Bluebook
on the investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects
in the New Jersey area, night of 1 Jan 54.

J. R. Gluck
Project Henry, PPS-161

18 February 1954 I made a phone call from New York to the
Intelligence Officer of the 568th Air Defense Group, McGuire AFB, New
Jersey, from whom ATIC had received the Form A3 on this case. A Capt.
Peterson was contacted, advised of my status on this project and of the
incident in question. He was familiar with the situation, promised full
cooperation, and asked if I would like to come down the next day.

19 February, arrived via train and bus from New York, found Capt.
Peterson, who turned me over to a Sgt. Alkire, of the 4602 AISS. A
staff car and driver were obtained and we drove to Toms River, N. J.

Upon arrival at Toms River we went first to the police station.
Alkire had established contact with these people before, when the initial
investigation had been conducted. The chief of police and one officer had
been among the observers. Then we proceeded to the home of Mr. & Mrs.

[Redacted names] who live on [Redacted] in Toms River, and a police car, with
the officer who had been an observer, came to meet us.

Three sets of observers are neighbors. Mrs. [Redacted], whom I would
call a better than average observer, took us across the street to the
backyard of the [Redacted] residence, from where she had made her observations.

She pointed out the beginning and end points of the visual sightings and
two photos were taken with a Polaroid camera I had rented in New York. These
photos are Fig. A and B. The first one, looking directly South, shows three
objects which were observed by seven people on [Redacted]. Photo B

pinpoints them very close to Tuckerton.

In Marlton we visited Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] Photos taken of their points of observation are shown in Figures B and F. Mr. [redacted] was driving home from Camden when he noticed streaks of light going past his windshield. His teen-age son was with him and they both noticed the objects at about the same time. They kept on driving, and after about 5 miles, when they reached their home, they could still see the things so they got out of the car and watched them from in front of the house. Mrs. [redacted] was ill, but finally they persuaded her to come out and see the lights, which she did, for a few minutes. The [redacted] did not observe three objects.

They saw six of them, in two groups of three. Each set would be doing different antics at different times, but the main maneuver was, as described at Toms River, that one of the three would remain stationary and the other two would circle around it. Mrs. [redacted] said the circling motion was always to one direction, but she couldn't remember whether it was clockwise or counterclockwise. The objects would change positions and one of the circling ones would take a turn at hovering. There was no definite frequency to this circling, no uniformity of motion or rhythmic pattern. The observers agreed that the circling objects moved around "pretty fast" and probably circled in not more than 2 to 3 seconds. As Figure F shows, after maneuvering in the limited area dotted in by [redacted] the objects sped off directly south, covering the 60 degrees in a matter of one to two seconds, and getting smaller and fainter as they disappeared. As will be seen by the photograph, these things were at a very low elevation, being seen behind some trees. In general, the evidence does not differ from the information received in Toms River. That is, that the objects were round or slightly oval, had the appearance of being self-luminous (likened then to a neon light), the edges were fuzzy but the total shape of the objects were well defined. Again, we asked about the

fuzzy edges, although the round shape was distinct, and they were a little
bit smaller than the moon. That is, they subtended about half a degree of
arc. There was not too good agreement on this point. A lot of people
said you would have had to hold a silver dollar or even a baseball at arms
length to cover these objects, which is in contradiction to other observers
(whom I would consider the better ones) who stated that a dime or even an
aspirin tablet would have covered these objects and that they were definitely
smaller than the moon. None of the observers throughout the state saw any
beams coming up from the ground which would indicate that the objects were
searchlight reflections. A couple of the observers said that their first
impression had been that these actually were searchlight beams playing
around, but that they could see no beam whatsoever, and from the manner in
which these objects streaked away into the south west sky, that it would have
been impossible for them to have originated from one single point on the
ground.

After getting the photo from the police station roof, I took
a bus back into New York.

20 February (Saturday morning) I contacted Dr. Hynek in
Middletown, Conn., and told him I thought it would be a good idea if this
investigation were continued. He agreed with this suggestion and I then
called Sgt. Aldire at McGuire AFB. He advised me to come down Monday
night and put in a full day Tuesday on this case.

23 February, Captain Hanson, the AISS CO at McGuire obtained
a staff car and we then drove to Marlton, N. J., which is just 33 of Camden.
The Marlton Observer's name had been obtained through a call to the Tuckerton
Beacon. This newspaper had carried a story on the incident, but no one in
Tuckerton, evidently, had seen the objects themselves. We called the CD
director and the police chief in Tuckerton, and they knew of no observers.
This is indeed strange, as will later be shown, the fix on these objects

gulls' wings." The main light, she said, varied in intensity. At Toms River, 4 people out of 10 stated that the three objects they observed changed brightness. The--- said that the main object was not as bright as the moon, and that if you had not been looking in the same general direction as these objects, you probably would not have noticed them at all. That is, they were not bright and flare-like, or glowing to such an extent that as soon as you came outside you would jerk your head around and exclaim "what's that?"

Th--- saw these objects at a low elevation; the only direction given was SSE. They got into their car and drove about 5 miles SE, watching the objects slightly to their left as they traveled. We had --- and his mother make independent sketches of what they saw. --- drew one large object and two smaller, slightly oblong ones, which he said circled the larger object constantly for the 15 minutes they observed. As to the disappearance of these objects, it was not a question of seeing them streak off, fade, or become smaller. Th--- attention had been diverted for a moment; when they looked around again, the objects were gone.

After returning from Woodbury, we called Mrs. --- at Surf City. Her name had also been mentioned in the Tuckerton article. We asked her a few questions over the phone, and she was quite willing to cooperate. She observed 3 objects for about 20 minutes. She said they were white, very plain, round, and not misty. They were at a higher elevation at Surf City, which is to be expected because of the shorter distance to them.

The only direction given by Mrs. --- was "a bit to the right when facing Beach Haven." From her description, let us assume not more than 20° as a course to these objects from just --- way.

Captain Hanson then made several calls to the Atlantic City

possibility of searchlights. They were definite in their response that these could not possibly have been searchlights because there was absolutely no beam and because of manner of disappearance of the objects. They also said that the sky was perfectly clear.

The one thing reported by Mr [redacted] that is completely different from any of the other observers is this: He states that when the objects were disappearing, that their color was red. When asked how red, he said "oh, about as red as Mars." This isn't very red, and I am wondering how much value we should place upon this observation. No other observers reported any color changes in the objects.

[Redacted] said that these objects were apparently about the same size as a pea held at arms length. At no time did any of the observers in any of the places visited say that these objects resembled stars. That is, they were extended sources with definite round or oval shapes. Incidentally, the moon was just before new, so at midnight it had not yet risen.

[Redacted] gave us the address of an observer in Woodbury, a suburb of Camden. There is a 12 mile distance between the Marlton and Woodbury points of observation.

Mrs [redacted] in Woodbury runs a real estate establishment, and when Capt. Hanson and I came in, she was all ready to sell us a 50,000 dollar house. She was quite impressed that we were investigating the incident, especially in view of her own opinions and emotions on the subject. She had just finished Adamski's book, and the previous night she had made a wish "to see a flying saucer." Her son, [redacted] is quite an intelligent boy, about college age, and his objective observing compensates for his mother being so flighty. Mrs [redacted] evidence differed from the Marlton observers. First, she said there were "several" objects - at least four, and secondly, that the main object, an "enormous, as big as the moon" silvery sphere, was circled by "waves of light, rectangular and white, like sea waves."

Captain Hanson learned, through and the Operations Officer of the 560th Air Defense Group, that after watching the objects for 5 minutes and being unable to establish their identity, called McGuire AFB in an effort to have some F-94s scrambled to the UFOs. The McGuire people contacted thought was "pulling their leg." They had no word from their ADCM on any objects, there was no radar evidence from any source, and they could not scramble any jets unless officially notified to do so.

The fixes are shown on the map. This seems to narrow the objects down to a point centering on Beach Haven, an island off the coast. When this position had been established, Captain Hanson suggested that perhaps the Navy was conducting an operation of some sort out there; doing some landings, some frog work, or whatever, at Little Egg Harbor or Great Bay. He said this had been done in the past, and that the terrain is very good for training exercises of this type. However, he contradicted himself in saying that the incident took place on January 1, and that it was rather unlikely that so soon after a holiday such an exercise would have been scheduled. He declined to contact anyone at Beach Haven itself. He said it was not worth it, getting these people all worked up, and he didn't want to take the chance of getting this into the newspapers. If the fix is correct, it should mean that Beach Haven residents would have seen the objects directly overhead. However, people in Tuckerton, Mayes Landing, and Atlantic City, as far as we have been able to ascertaining made no observations.

From the altitude-azimuth coordinates, and observational data gathered on angles subtended, and angular velocities, Dr. Hynek has found the following minimum values:

Altitude    4 miles
Distance    1,500 feet
Speed at which UFOs broke off    90,000 mph.
