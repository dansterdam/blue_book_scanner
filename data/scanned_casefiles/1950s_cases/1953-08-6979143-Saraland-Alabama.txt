STATEMENT OF
SARALAND, ALABAMA

On 2 August 1952 at 16:30 - 17:30 PM local time, I was sitting in my back yard gazing at the stars when I saw the bright reflection of the sun on the object appear to be about 20 feet in diameter and hovering a few feet above the ground. As the object appeared to be descending slowly to the ground, I became frightened and watched to see what would happen next. The object turned to a dull lead color and made no sound, so I went to the door to point it out to my wife to witness it also. When I returned, the object had disappeared. The time of sighting was less than a minute. By outside appearance it seemed clearly to be some type of aircraft in the area at the time of sighting. I did not see or hear any other aircraft in the area at the time of sighting.

The image contains no photograph, only text describing an unidentified flying object sighting. The text describes an object sighted on August 2, 1953 near Saraland, Alabama. The object had a shape similar to a parachute or balloon, was traveling at a very high speed, and emitted a bright light that reflected off the ground. The object appeared to be spinning while descending, and due to its high altitude and distance, no sounds were associated with it. The sighting was observed by a witness located southwest of Fairview, Alabama, with coordinates provided. Additional meteorological details are also included in the text.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The Intelligence Officer of the 1773 AQC conducted an investigation and obtained the following information:

On 31 July 1952, at approximately 2000-2330 hours local time, Mr. **** (name redacted) of Saraland, Alabama, observed a bright light in the sky near Saraland. He stated the light was the size of a basketball at arm's length, stationary at first, then moved to the east and then back to its original position. The light then began to move in an erratic manner, making sharp turns and stops. It was difficult to estimate the size, speed and altitude of the object due to the lack of reference points. The light appeared to be a fairly high altitude. The object was observed for a period of about 30 minutes and was associated with the glow and was mistaken as the retraction of the gear on an aircraft. The observer, who was on the roof of his house, was alone at the time, and there were no other witnesses.

On 1 August 1952 at 2030 hours local time, the same observer reported seeing a similar object in the sky. This object appeared as a bright light, bluish-white in color, larger than a star, and appeared in the same general area as the previous sighting. The object remained stationary for several minutes, then began to move in an erratic manner, making rapid turns and varying its speed. It was observed for about 45 minutes before disappearing from sight.

On 2 August 1952 at 1700-1730 hours local time, the observer again saw a similar object in the sky. This object appeared larger and brighter than the previous two and seemed to be metallic in appearance. It made a series of rapid turns and darted back and forth for several minutes before disappearing behind some trees. The observer estimated the object was at an altitude of about 5,000 to 7,000 feet."
