And distance from the observers. No sounds were associated with this object and the duration of sighting was less than a minute. Individual did not see aircraft in the area. In the area of the sighting, location of the observers at the time of the sighting was southwest of Satsuma, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 50 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 05 minutes West. Reliability 2-.

On 17 August 1953 at 0355 hours local time, [redacted] and [redacted] were looking for the Little Dipper when they saw the flying object. It appeared as a bright reddish glow heading from the North to the South, and on the East side. Object was traveling at a high rate of speed and at a fairly high altitude. Both observers agreed that this object far exceeded the speed of jet aircraft they had seen in this area. Duration of the sighting was approximately three seconds. Neither of the observers saw or heard any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. There was no sound associated with this object.

It appears to be a matter of a chance location of the observers at the time of sighting was in Satsuma, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 51 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 05 minutes West. Reliability 5-.

Reliability of observers is as stated above.

No interrogation was attempted since the sighting was late in being reported.

The weather is reported as in Enclosure #7.

STATEMENT OF SIGHTINGS
SARALAND, ALABAMA

On 2 August 1953 at 16:30 - 17:30 PM local time, I was sitting in my back yard facing to the NE, when I saw the unidentified object. The part of the sky sighting that caught my eye was the bright reflection of the sun on the object appeared to be long with a wide top and tapering to a point at the bottom. The path of flight was away from me to the SE and in a forward direction. Due to the bright reflection of the sun on the object, it appeared to be spinning in it's downward flight. It appeared to be small due to the altitude and distance and the duration of the sighting was less than 2 minutes. No unusual associated with object. I did not see or hear any aircraft in the area at the time of sighting.

Numerous city and location names are visible, though some are difficult to read clearly due to the map's density and image quality.

Handwritten notation appears near the top of the page, but is not fully legible.

The image appears to be an aeronautical chart with various grid sections, roads, and caution areas marked, with a dense network of lines and annotations.

Detailed at approximately 1300 CST, 26 August 1953, an 18700 ATC message was received directing the Intelligence Officer of the support group of Strategic Air Command to investigate a report of a flying object sighted from 21 July 1953 through 17 August 1953, inclusive.

The Intelligence Officer of the 1702d ATC conducted an investigation and obtained the following statements from the observers:

On 31 July 1953 at approximately 2000-2030 hours local time, Mr. [redacted] of [redacted], Alabama, was on his way home from several miles North of Creola, Alabama, when he sighted an object through the windshield of his vehicle. From the Southwest, crossed his way and disappeared to the Northeast. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and was a fairly high altitude. The object showed a bright, fluorescent color and duration of sighting was for only a few seconds. No sounds were associated with the glow and did not appear to resemble a meteor or a shooting star. The location of the observer at the time of sighting was North of Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 36 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Reliability 3-3.

On 1 August 1953 at 2030 hours local time, Mr. [redacted] was getting into his vehicle when he sighted the flying object. This object was on the spot near the highway at a high angle of elevation. He could not estimate the altitude other than stating that it was at a fairly high altitude and that this object was not too far away from where he was standing. The object appeared to glow a golden color in the remaining part. Light did not resemble a meteor or a shooting star, and no sound was associated with this light. Duration of the sighting, the observer stated, was a few seconds. Location of the observer at the time of the sighting was in Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 36 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Reliability 3-3.

On 2 August 1953 at 0330 hours local time, Mr. [redacted], Methodist minister, was on his way home from Slocum to Saraland, Alabama when he sighted the flying object. He was driving an amber color object with the headlights of other cars on the leading edge. He gave the appearance blurred and moved toward the west. The object was heading from the North to the South in a straight and level flight parallel to the highway, on the east side, at a high altitude. Sighted object was estimated to be 6-6,000 feet high. It appeared to be fairly large in size with no sounds associated and traveling at a high rate of speed. Upon the individual stated he has knowledge of Meteorology and that the object was neither a meteor nor a shooting star. Observer did not see or have any different in the area at the time of the sighting. Location of the observer sighting was at Creola, Alabama, latitude 30 degrees 32 minutes North, longitude 88 degrees 32 minutes West. Reliability 3-C.
