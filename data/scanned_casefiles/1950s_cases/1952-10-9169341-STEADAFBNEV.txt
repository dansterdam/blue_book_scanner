The object appeared to be composed of an energized substance that emits light. When stationary, it was very similar to a star with the exception of blinking or revolving lights that appeared from time to time from a position above the main body of the object and at variations in intensity of the light reflected or produced by the object itself.

The object remained to the west of us at all times during the period of observation. Its most significant characteristic was the illumination mentioned above with the main body appearing to be oval in shape with a lower portion also oval that appeared to be similar to a large search light. The lower part of the object was only visible when the object appeared to turn, which may account for the variation in intensity of the overall illumination. In other words, when the object turned toward us, the brightly lighted lower portion was visible.

There were two blinking or revolving lights just above the main oval that at times appeared red and green.

The object went through three types of maneuvers - altitude change, hover and horizontal change. The altitude ranged from a roughly estimated 30,000 to 60,000 ft. The object appeared to spend most of its time hovering. The horizontal speed is roughly estimated in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. The distance of the object from the aircraft ranged from roughly 50 to 150 miles.

The object appeared to hover, change altitude and move horizontally unlike any aeronautical development known to this observer. In appearance, it most closely resembled a large dirigible that has been brightly illuminated.

The red and green lights mentioned above lead this observer to believe that the object was man-made and the manner in which it maneuvered definitely established that the object was controlled.

SUBJECT: (Unclassified) UNKNOWN SUBJECT(S):
Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft
at West Barrington, Rhode Island, at
2205, 26 October 1952
POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE

TO:   Director of Special Investigations
      Headquarters, USAF
      Washington 25, D. C.

SYNOPSIS:

On 26 October 1952, at approximately 2205 hours, West Barrington, Rhode Island, observed two (2) unidentified airborne objects. No activities or conditions developed to account for sightings. Appears to be a reliable, mature individual who considers it his duty to report such incidents, made notes of the observation shortly after the sighting, which he referred to in relating the information. (OSI, B-2, Confidential)

DETAILS:

1. At approximately 2205 hours, 26 October 1952, West Barrington, Rhode Island, sighted two (2) unidentified airborne objects and reported these sightings to the Commanding Officer, 1524 Fighter Squadron, Air National Guard (RI), Hillsgrove Airport, Warwick, Rhode Island. On 25 November, was interviewed by Special Agent FRANCIS E. BARRETT and gave the following information:

a. Description of objects: Two (2) egg-shaped objects, from a distance of from eight to ten miles appeared to be side of a small coin. Objects appeared smooth with no ports or tail assembly and did not leave a vapor trail. Objects appeared to move in formation at

a speed much greater than the fastest jet aircraft and covered approximately fifteen degrees in an estimated one-tenth of a second. The course of the objects was estimated to be due south when first sighted by objects who was facing a northwesterly direction. Objects were estimated to be two to five degrees above the horizontal and maintained that elevation during the entire time sighted. Described the color of the objects as "silvery light", unlike any star or meteor. The objects appeared to be over Providence, Rhode Island, which is a distance of eight to ten miles in a northwesterly direction. The objects produced no audible noise or vibrations.

b. Objects were sighted by [redacted] at about 2205 hours EST, 26 October 1952 and were clearly observed for an estimated one-tenth of a second in the clear and for a fraction of a second through trees which obscured the line of vision.

c. Sighting was by visual observation only.

d. Observer sighted the objects from the yard of his residence in West Barrington, Rhode Island.

e. Identifying information on observer [redacted] twenty-four years of age, has recently completed five years of active service with the U. S. Navy and is at present a student in a local radio school. Advised that while in the Navy, he underwent extensive training in radar and served as a radar man for about three years. Appeared to be familiar with various types of aircraft and stated that he has never observed a comparable object. He was advised that while in the public service he did not report it immediately because he was afraid of the unfavorable publicity that such a report might create. However, [redacted] stated, he reported the sighting within two days to the 1524 Air National Guard (at) Hillsgrove Airport, Warwick, Rhode Island. USAFOIN advised that he inquired of persons in the neighborhood, but that no one had observed the objects. After sighting these objects, he wrote down all he could recall, and he used this information in relating the details of his observance.

f. Weather Conditions: [redacted] stated that at the time of sighting, the weather was clear with very little wind and visibility was excellent. The U. S. Weather Bureau, Providence, Rhode Island, advised that weather conditions at 2205 hours, 26 October 1952, were high, broken clouds, no precipitation, visibility excellent, with very little wind.

g. No activity or condition is known that might account for the sighting. Advised that at the time of the sighting, he was casually observing the stars and lights of Providence because of the excellent visibility.

h. No physical evidence exists and no interception action was taken.

i. Manner of disappearance: Objects moved behind trees located nearby and were observed for a fraction of a second through openings in the trees.

ACTION:

One (1) copy of this report will be forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, Attention: ATIC. No further action is contemplated by this District Office.
