The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing the observation of an unidentified flying object.

the object appeared to be composed of an extremely bright light, and it was very similar to a star, although it was not stationary. it varied in intensity from time to time, from a position above the main body of the object and its variations in intensity or pulsation by the object itself.

the object maneuvered to the west of us at all times during the period of observation. its most significant characteristic was the diminishing and increasing in size and shape with the main body appearing to be oval in shape with a lower protrusion also oval which appeared to be similar to a searchlight. the object changed hue from time to time, and the variation in intensity of the overall illumination, in other words when the object turned toward us, the brilliant portion was visible.

there were two distinct or pulsating lights just above the main oval that at times appeared red and green.

the object went through three types of maneuvers - altitude changes, horizontal changes, and oscillating or rocking motions. the horizontal speed was roughly estimated in excess of 1000 miles per hour. the distance of the object from the aircraft ranged from a roughly estimated 50 to 150 miles.

the object appeared to hover, change altitude and move horizontally, constantly unlike any aeronautical device known to this observer. in appearance, it most closely resembled a large dirigible that has been brightly illuminated.

the red and green lights mentioned above lead this observer to believe that the object was man-made and the manner in which it maneuvered definitely established that the object was controlled.

Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft
at West Barrington, Rhode Island, at
2205, 26 October 1952
POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, USAF

SYNOPSIS:
On 26 October 1952, at approximately 2205 hours, Barrington, Rhode Island, observed two (2)
unidentified airborne objects. No activities or conditions developed to account for sighting, made
by observer who considers it his duty to report such incidents, and who is referred to in relating
the information. (OSI, B-2, Confidential)

DETAILS:
1. At approximately 2205 hours, 26 October 1952, two (2) unidentified airborne objects were
sighted over Barrington, Rhode Island, described as egg-shaped objects, approximately 30 feet
in diameter, traveling at a high rate of speed approximately 2000 to 3000 feet in altitude. The
objects appeared to be the size of a basketball, and did not leave a vapor trail. Objects appeared
to move in formation at a high rate of speed.

a speed much greater than the fastest jet aircraft and covered approxi- mately fifteen degrees of arc in a estimated one-tenth of a second. The lights of the objects were reported as blinking on and off. The objects appeared to be two in number, traveling in a northwesterly direction. Objects were estimated to be two to five miles high and maintained that elevation during the entire time sighted. The observer also described the color of the objects as a steady yellowish-white light, similar to a star. The objects appeared to be over Providence, Rhode Island, which is situated about fifteen mile inland eastward from the observer.

b. Objects were sighted by at about 2205 hours EST, 26 October 1952 and were clearly observed for an estimated one-tenth of a second which caused the entire incident.

c. Sighting was by visual observation only.

d. Observer sighted the objects from the yard of his residence at West Barrington, Rhode Island.

e. Identifying information on observer's twenty-four years of age, has recently completed five years of active service with the U. S. Navy and is at present employed in a local radio school.  He has advised that while on the lookout for aircraft in radar service, observed for about three seconds two unidentified objects in the sky and stated that he has never observed a comparable object before which convinced him that report it immediately because he was afraid of the unfavorable publicity that such a report might create.  However, because of the unfavorable publicity that reporting the sighting has inadvertantly created in his community, he advised that shortly after sighting these objects, he wrote down all he could recall and he used this documentation in relaying the details of his observation.

f. Weather Conditions: stated that at the time of the sighting, the weather was clear, with very little wind and visibility was excellent. The U. S. Weather Bureau Providence, Rhode Island, reported that on 26 October 1952, there were clear skies, no precipitations, visibility excellent, with very little wind.

g. No activity or condition is known that might account for the sighting. He was usually observing the stars and lights of Providence because of his excellent visibility.
