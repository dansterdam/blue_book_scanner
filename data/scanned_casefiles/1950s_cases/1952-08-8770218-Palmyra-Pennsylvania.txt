AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(UNCLASSIFIED) Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Table, FLYOBREP)

LOCATION Middletown Air Materiel Area
DATE OF REPORT 27 August 1952

PREPARED BY (Originator) John L. Spiegel, 24 Lt, USAF

REFERENCES (Coord number, directive, proforma report, etc. as applicable)

SOURCE Civilian Observer

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in first one-sentence paragraph. List locations at lower left. Attach map of report on AF Form 112—Part II)

1. On [redacted] Palmyra, Penna., [redacted] reported sighting an unidentified flying object on 24 August at 21502.

2. [redacted] described a "very bright" light in the feet approximately. The light was moving from [redacted] northward steadily at 450 alone. The light was visible for approximately five minutes and three times during this period it "blinked" an and off. At the end minutes it disappeared and did not reappear.

Three other members of [redacted] family also witnessed the sighting. Persons employed as signal maintainer on the Reading Railroad [redacted].

The observer explained that there was an aircraft in the area at the time which he was also observing, but he stated that the sighting from that plane were quite different from the light which he reported.

Weather at the time was clear with 15 miles visibility with winds at 5 at 5 from the northwest.

This office can offer no definite explanation of the sighting.

The length of observation seems to discount the probability of an aircraft, but it would appear that a weather balloon is still a strong possibility.
