Here is the OCR text from the document:

on 27 June 1952 Mrs.

of the Public Information Office, on telephone Rect 29100, ext 260, that

she, her husband, two children and a
neighbor had seen a flying saucer. Her
conclusion that the object was a flying
saucer, was stimulated by her neighbors
who, after hearing her 1st experience, said
she had seen a flying saucer.

Capt. Haussman was contacted and by telephone
gave a brief description of the incident. Mrs.
Oppenheimer was contacted and gave
the following description:

While on the roof of her
apartment building early Friday morning
June 27, Mrs. observed a
round, disc-shaped object hovering in
the direction of Laguardia Airport. The
object then stood up on end and sailed off
at terrific speed toward downtown Manhattan.
It was a thick object with a dull gray
light around it. When the object disappeared
