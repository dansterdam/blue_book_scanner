point of the aerial object that flashed over Western Washington early Sunday. As the map shows, the object, apparently a meteor, traveled from south to north and have been identified at the point indicated on the map. Position was determined by eyewitness reports from an officer and various ground observers. After tracking, following of the object traveled to the northwest into an area not covered by the map.

Dated lines and arrows indicate direction of flight of eyewitnesses who established approximate location of the head.

(rest of first paragraph is illegible)

Cal. T. Allen Bennett, commanding officer of the 25th Air Force Defense Division, McChord Air Force Base, also leaned toward the theory that the object which exploded at 1:26 a. m. was a meteor, but he said his office is making a thorough check of eyewitness reports and is anxious to receive them.

Bennett said he doubted that the object could have been an aircraft or guided missile.

None of the radar installations in the Pacific Northwest network picked up the object, he said.

ANGLE—
Asked if the speed of the object Bennett said that the angle, rather than speed, probably was what caused it not to show as a "blip" on the radar scopes.

"If it was a meteor, it was probably coming nearly straight down. That would make it very difficult to track. The indications might be so insignificant that radar wouldn't pick it up," he said.

"If it was an aircraft or a guided missile, we would have picked it up," he continued.

REQUEST—
Bennett asked that anyone finding a "strange" piece of material report it to his organization at McChord.

Bennett said that the ground observer phase of the air defense setup is not at present on a 24-hour basis, and said no ground observers had reported seeing the flash.

The two-second blast, a tremendous blue-white flare, caused no ascertainable damage, but police, fire department and newspaper switchboards were jammed by hundreds of anxious calls from suddenly awakened persons.

Many believed, after the blast, (continued on Page 2 Column 1)

ourt Meteor Explodes With A Roar;
Scares Thousands In Seattle
By Associated Press

SEATTLE, May 11—A giant meteor swished across western Washington and exploded with a tremendous flash and roar over Seattle at 1:26 a.m. today.

It frightened thousands of persons as it lighted the sky and rattled doors and windows.

No pieces were found, however, and the greatest damage seemed to have been inflicted on the people's nerves.

A 30-second rumble followed the breaking apart of the celestial visitor into an estimated four to large pieces.

Altitude Estimated

Witnesses found it difficult to estimate the object's altitude and speed, but triangulation fixed the ample power explosion point somewhere over a mile high in the central Seattle area.

The Coast Guard estimated from early reports that it might have been as low as 2,000 feet when it burst. However, Capt. Bert Carlson, a Northwest Airlines pilot, finds said it appeared to be only a little over B. Pert. below his altitude of 8,000 feet.

Newspaper and police switchboard were jammed by excited callers whose fear ranged from explosion of an atom bomb to an earthquake. Very few thought of a meteor.

Police and state patrolmen practiced fruitless efforts to find pieces of the meteor.

"It was a blue-white magnesium color," they reported over the police radio. "It lit up the sky like chain lightning."

There were no estimates immediately available as to the size of the meteor.

Like Chain Lightning

Reports to the Coast Guard said the object broke into eight or 10 pieces. Two other patrolmen, J. H. Davis and R. G. Carmody, witnessed the incident from the bridge across Lake Washington, five miles southwest of Greenlake.

There is also an advertisement for "Terminix" and an advertisement for an arthritis treatment that reads "Arthritis Torture 'Nearly' Locked My Joints".

Was Eerie Explosion a Meteor?

SKY-BLAST ROCKS

SEATTLE -- An unidentified radio-possibly a giant meteor -- rumbled like a freight train across the sky and exploded over Seattle early Sunday.

The Air Defense Command began an immediate investigation.

The explosion rattled this industrial city of 600,000 persons in a circle 300-miles wide and knocked city dwellers from their beds.

The blast was visible from 60 miles away, and occurred at a height estimated as low as 2,000 feet.

THOUSANDS of persons were awakened by the concussion, but there was no report of damage.

The phenomenon was at first definitely believed to be caused by a meteor explosion within the earth's atmosphere.

But astronomers said it was almost impossible for a meteor within 2,000 feet of the ground before integrating.

Some pointed out, however, that it might have been higher than reported by observers.

Dr. Fred L. Whipple, Harvard University meteor expert, said that if the Washington blast had been a little lower it might have wiped out all of Seattle and its inhabitants.

AN ASTRONOMER at the Yerkes Observatory, Lake Geneva, Wis., said the Seattle Northwest Airlines Pilot Bert Carlson sighted the object as he prepared to land at Seattle-Tacoma international airport. He said it was at about 7,000 feet when it suddenly shattered into eight pieces with a bright flash.

Yerkes experts were inclined to doubt that the object exploded even as low as 7,000 feet.

"Fireballs usually explode 10 to 15 miles up," he said.

"However, anything can happen, and the reported form of the explosion suggests that it was somewhat lower than the usual height."

The familiar surfaces burn off rapidly from friction with the air and they often explode from the tremendous heat.

"METEORS" surfaces burn before the goal direct.

Headline: Explosion a Meteor?

ROCKS SEATTLE

[Partial text from the article, some sections are difficult to read fully:]

Whipple, daily meteor expert at the Yerkes Observatory, said...

AN ASTRONOMER at the Yerkes Observatory, Lake Geneva, Wis., said the Seattle phenomenon apparently was a "fireball" - a big meteor heavy enough to penetrate into the earth's lower atmosphere.

But the Yerkes expert, Prof. Gerhard Kuiper, said...

"METEORS surfaces burn off rapidly from friction with the air and they often explode from the tremendous heat." Fragments are seldom found. Kuiper said, either because they burn up before reaching ground or because they are too small to be noticed.

"However, anything can happen, and the reported force of the explosion suggests that it was somewhat lower than the usual height."

THREE SEATTLE police patrol cars reported the object exploded over Green Lake in North Seattle at about 2,000 feet.

Sidney Howick, weather observer at the Seattle-Tacoma airport weather bureau, said: "It was sort of a light-green, light-thing. It lasted two seconds at most."

Most observers agreed the object was travelling from southwest to northeast when it blew up.

"Everything turned like fireworks or something were fireball or something falling straight down like fireworks. That came in another couple of seconds. Two or three minutes later I heard the rumble."

Ten hours after the explosion, there were no reports of damage or recovered fragments.

Sector, 26th Air Division (Det):

0350    Radio report of explosion over Seattle was relayed by CGC, this Bn.

0360    An object believed to be a meteor was sighted coming from the north and
        going north. The object crossed over Seattle. The police at 7:20 contacted
        by a Northwest Airlines pilot, Seattle Police, who may have other. The
        exact description was not known but it continued to be a bright object
        given off its speed. The airlines pilot was not available to verify.

1125    The pilot of the Northwest Airlines was ----. Down 4:40.
        No reports sighting the object 2 minutes before hearing the light flash.
        However, a CGC (CG-3) and expected to a rockety, vivid blue, with
        green or orange central portion. The object was seen to be below his A/C level (7000 ft) with 14th strike, flash which lasted
        the sky but not the ground. He did not see a real explosion.

        The A/C was landed at Sea-Tac. The Sea-Tac controller at Bremerton
        close to the object as it landed in the Eastern
        Washington State Patrol, Seattle wrote: "Sighting the object. Sighting was
        from a "green" at the north end of the object. There was not precisely
        explained. Apparent of a green or yellow island. He saw it close and
        some 2 seconds later felt the blast. Apparently no one has ever seen
        masses of people sighting the object because of the volume of call's.

1305    The University of Washington professor mentioned in the reports of
        Seattle. He now says he believes the explosion to be a meteor and is
        completely at a loss for a project. The whole is to be not say.

From evidence available it is the opinion of the undersigned, the
unidentified object was a meteor.

Air Force Checks Data
On Presumed Meteor
(Continued from Page 1)

An earthquake had rocked the
Pacific Northwest.

After hearing descriptions
of the object, trained ob-
servers agreed the visitor was
most likely a meteor that fell
from deep space, to blow itself to
pieces as friction from the atmosphere heated it to extreme temperatures.

Possible explanation was
guessed the object to be a "Russian bomb."

At least four competent ob-
servers had examined view of
the "fireball." They were the
pilot and control tower man
of Northwest Airlines at Tacoma International Airport.

A United States Weather Bureau
observer there and a control tower operator.

PILOTS SAY IT —

Capt. B. C. Carlson and Co-
pilot Earl Perry, flying a Special Airlines plane from McChord Air Force Base, were the
first (listed at 1:52 a. m.) by the
watch and burst into flame
near Chehalis, Wash., said Capt.
Carlson said:

"We were approaching the

heart of a due west course at
1,000 feet. The flash increased from south to north
across our course, apparently
between us and the airport."

Perry and Carlson said no
sound accompanied the meteor.

But, from the observation roof
at the airport, Weather Observer
Sid Howick traced the course of
the ragged manners of flame and
felt a "definite shock wave" about
2 to 2½ minutes after the first
flash.

From the airport control tower,
Civil Air Reconnaissance Specialist Arthur Weaver astronomically noted:

"Observed very brilliant blue
light at 1:52 a. m. (PDT). Appeared to originate from northeast direction. Land tremor (explosion)
noted about 2 minutes afterward."

OVER WIDE AREA —

The flare was seen and the
tremor was felt in Seattle and
surrounding communities. The State Patrol reported the blast was felt in
several Tacoma and Bremerton
areas. Hundreds of Seattle residents jarred out of sound
sleep were Mrs. G. V. Rooney,
5106 6th St., who said: "The
windows rattled and we thought
the house was coming down."

S. W. Skelly, 7125 44th Ave.
SW, who described the rumble
that followed the flash as a
shock wave that shook my house."

SAY FLASH —

From the window of his Mercer
Island home, Guy L. Bellinger,
7424 W. Mercer Way, saw what
he described as a "tremendous
flash of light."

"The light seemed to go
straight up, like a huge electronic something like when a
transformer explodes. The
flash was so bright it looked
almost as high as Mount
Rainier."

Bellinger said there had
been a terrific explosion. I
heard for a shock. It seemed
like 1½ to 2 minutes before the
shock wave hit."

Engineer Reports
On Meteor

No one got a better "fix" on
Sunday's meteor than Don E. Lyman, Seattle engineer, who went down in his home, 16633-19th Ave.
S. W., when the flash blinded
him momentarily.

Working quickly, he went to
his watch, compass and map.
These were his observations:

1. The flash came at 1:52 a. m., by
his watch, which was accurate in
duration. The normal brightness
of the flash was maintained for
about 1/10 of a second.

2. The mercury or mineral was a mercury or mineral with a trace of
no trace of uranium.

3. The flash was followed by a
deep, shaking tremor which lasted about 2½ minutes after the flash.
In his opinion the explosion occurred 50 to 75 miles above the horizon and
at 2½ minutes after the flash was
15 degrees above the horizon and
15 degrees east of north.

The tremor had a deep, long
lasting sound apparently down

Air Force Checking Presumed Meteor That Shook Seattle

Not Seen On Radar

Astronomers throughout the nation, and the United States Air Force, guardian of the skies, displayed keen interest Sunday in the fiery object that flashed across the Seattle area in the blackness of the early morning, then exploded violently.

Scientists who make a study of outer space concluded the object was a large meteor which plunged through the earth's blanket of air and disintegrated into flaming meteors.

However, the Air Force has become interested in all key visitors of the area and is in the process of keeping a radar watch of all things, natural or man-made, that pass overhead.

CHECKING DATA—

As eyewitness accounts of the strange light and following blast came in from widely scattered parts of Western Washington, astronomers were quick to point out that an unusually big fireball had been a very spectacular sight for those who saw it.

Col. G. Allan Bennett, commanding officer of the 25th Air Force Defense Division, McChord Air Force Base, said he learned of the object from eyewitness reports and is anxiously trying to check them.

Bennett said he doubted that the object could have been an aircraft or guided missile.

None of the radar installations in the Pacific Northwest noticed the object on their screens, he said.

ANGLE

Asked if the speed of the object may have altered the radar, Bennett said that the angle, path and probably route was what caused it not to show as a "blip" on the radar scope.

It was probably coming nearly straight down. That would make it very difficult to track. The indications might be significant that the radar wouldn't pick it up.

"If we saw an aircraft or guided missile, we would have picked it up," he continued.

REQUEST—

Personnel asked that anyone finding a "strange" piece of material report it to his organization at McChord.

Bennett said that the ground tremor was not at present on a 24-hour basis, and said no ground investigation has been made of the flash.

The two-second blast, a tremendous noise like a giant class, cut and no aftershock damage was reported. Switchboards were jammed by hundreds of anxious calls from suddenly awakened persons.

LINE OF FLIGHT—Shown on this map is the path and the traveling time of the mysterious object, apparently a meteor, traveled from south to north and burst into fragments at the point indicated on the map. Positions were determined by eyewitness reports from an official Air Force triangulation observer, after being checked with United lines and arrows indicating direction of flight of eyewitnesses.
