Portent of the aerial phenomena over Western Washington early Sunday. At the same glance, reports from several cities, received from south to north, indicated that an unidentified phenomenon was observed traveling from south to north and had been detected by several observers. After bursting, fragments of the phenomenon were carried across an area covered by the map. Several beams of light were reported by observers, who established approximately positions of the beams.
(Past-Intelligence Map)
Col. T. Allan Bennet, commanding officer of the 25th Air Force Defense Division, McCord Air Force Base, also leaned toward the theory that the object which exploded at 1:25 a.m. was actually some kind of aircraft or guided missile. However, he said his office is making a thorough check of eyewitness reports and is anxious to receive them.
Bennett said he doubted that the object could have been an aircraft or guided missile. None of the radar installations in the Pacific Northwest network picked up the object on their screens, he said.
ANGLE-
Asked if the speed of the object may have eluded the radar, Bennett said that the object, whatever speed, probably would have shown up on the radar scope. He said it was not to show a "blip" on the radar screens.
"If it was a meteor, it was probably coming nearly straight down. That would make it very difficult to track. The indications might be so insignificant that radar wouldn't pick it up," he said.
"If it was an aircraft or a guided missile, we would have picked it up," he continued.
REQUEST-
Bennett asked that anyone finding a "strange" piece of material report it to his organization at McCord. 
Bennett said that the ground observers phase of the air defense setup is not at present on a 24-hour basis, and said no ground observers had reported seeing the flash.
The two-second blast, a tremendous blue-white flare, caused no ascertainable damage, but police, fire department and newspaper switchboards were jammed by hundreds of anxious calls from suddenly-awakened persons. 
Many believed, after the blast, that it was a crash of some kind.

COURT METEOR EXPLODES WITH A ROAR: ON SCARES THOUSANDS IN SEATTLE
SEATTLE, May 11 - A giant meteor swished across western Washington and exploded with a tremendous flash and roar over Seattle at 11:25 a.m. today. It frightened thousands of persons as it lighted the sky and rattled doors and windows.
The flash, however, and the greatest damage seemed to have been inflicted on the people's nerves.
A 30-second rumble followed the blinding flash of the celestial explosion. Early estimates placed the area of the blast at four to five miles north of Greenslake, in north central Seattle.
Witnesses found it difficult to determine the altitude of the object, but they estimated its size as comparable to a large piece of tinfoil.
Northwest Airlines pilots, however, said it appeared to be only a little larger than a baseball.
Early reports to the Coast Guard said the object was sighted first as a blinding light in the north and of steadily moving toward the south. They reported the object had exploded into five pieces approximately five miles southwest of Greenslake.
Police and state patrolmen preceded forth fruitless efforts to find the pieces of the meteor.

Was Eerie Explosion a Meteor?

SKY BLAST ROCKS

SEATTLE — An unidenli-
fied object — possibly a me-
teor — "ripped like a
freight train" across the
sky over Seattle and ex-
ploded early Sunday.

The blast, which was felt
as far away as Forest
Hills, Wash., 40 miles from
Seattle, was seen by thous-
ands of persons. The explo-
sion, which created a seis-
mic disturbance, shattered
windows and shook build-
ings. The blast was estimat-
ed as loud as 5,000 tons of
TNT. The U. S. Air Force
said the blast was probably
a "bolide," a bright meteor
that flashes and explodes
within the earth's atmos-
phere.

The blast was heard by
persons in a wide area, ap-
parently reaching as far as
50 miles from Seattle.
James E. Yunge, of the U.
S. Coast and Geodetic Sur-
vey, estimated the height
of the explosion at 20,000
to 25,000 feet.

Dr. Fred L. Whipple,
Harvard astronomer, said
that the Washington blast
was higher than reported
by observers. Whipple said
that the blast could have
originated within the
earth's atmosphere.

Norwood Allison, pilot,
reported seeing a brilliant
saucer-shaped object about
2,000 feet high estimated as
low as 2,000 feet.

Thousands of persons
were awakened by the ex-
plosion, but there was no
substantial damage.

The Air Force said such
a blast was first definitely
believed to be within the
earth's atmosphere and
was almost impossible for
a meteor to get within 2,000
feet of the ground before
disintegrating.

THREE SEATTLE police patrol reported the ob- jects exploded over Green Lake in North Seattle at about 1:0 A.M. 
Sidney Horwitz, weather observer at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport, said the weather had been highly unusual, with a "lifting-off thing" lasting two seconds at most.
"Everything turned blue. As soon as it went out there were streams or something falling down in those trees. That came in three or four minutes later. I heard the rumble."
Most observers agreed the object was traveling from northwest to southeast, and some thought it broke in two before disappearing.
Two or three minutes later there were no reports of damage or recovered fragments.

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
At approximately 0132 PST, on 11 May 1952, many individuals reported sighting a vivid blue object with flaming sparks or streamers coming nearly straight down over Seattle, Washington. The object exploded in a brilliant flash, lighting up the sky and then disappeared. After the explosion, some of the witnesses reported a tremendous shock wave of approximately nine seconds duration.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION
Two local astronomers were contacted and they stated that the object was a meteor. At the present time the astronomers are searching for fragments to confirm their statement.

III. CONCLUSIONS
Object was probably a meteor but file will not be closed until confirming evidence is found.

Air Force Checks Data
On Presumed Meteor
(Continued from Page 1)
it was learned that the tremor had rocked the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, approximately an hour before the first sighting was reported.
Garland and Carlson said that about 1:08 a.m. (PST) they saw a bright light "move across the sky from north to north." The light, they said, was followed by a burst of light and a report.
Lt. Col. Donald E. Keyhoe traced the course of the object and said that it was estimated to be traveling at a speed of 1,200 to 1,400 miles per hour.
"This speed and the explosive nature of the burst of light indicate the object was not an airplane or meteor, and the fact that it was observed from several different points rule out the possibility of a hoax or hallucination," Keyhoe said.
OVER WIDE AREA
The flash was seen and the report heard over a wide area including the Seattle and surrounding communities. The flash and report were practically simultaneous, indicating that the object was not far from the ground.
"Typical of hundreds of Seattle residents, John Lovelady stated, 'I was working in my backyard when the flash came. We went to the windows, pulled back the curtains and saw the rumble and flash which seemed to come from the ground near Green Lake.'"
5 4 FT. FLASH
The flash was estimated to be 54 feet long and was visible for about 2 to 3 seconds. The report or explosion was heard 4 or 5 seconds later. It was described as a low rumbling roar.
Though flight was seen, there were no reports of any aircraft in the area. The Air Force and the Civil Aeronautics Administration checked thoroughly but could find no record of any planes in the vicinity.

Engineer Reports
On Meteor
An air force report stated that the object was "larger than Don E. Johnson's flash camera." According to the report, the object appeared to be traveling at a speed of between 1,200 and 1,400 miles per hour.
The object appeared to be about 54 feet long and the flash lasted for 2 or 3 seconds. The explosion or report was heard about 4 or 5 seconds later.
"The tremor which shook the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, had occurred about an hour before the sighting was reported," the report stated.
The report concluded that the incident was "an extremely intense and spectacular meteor" and that it had caused the tremor felt in the area.

AIR FORCE CHECKING PRESUMED METEOR THAT SHOOK SEATTLE
Not Seen On Radar
Astronomers & the United States Air Force, guardian of the nation's air defenses, have been unable to find any trace of an object that apparently rocked the area in the early hours of Saturday morning, though it was observed violently. Scientists who make a study of meteorites and meteors have been unable to find any trace of impact on the earth's surface at the spot where the object hovered briefly before disappearing. The Air Force has been checking the area thoroughly but has been unable to find any trace of the object.
CHECKING DATA
All available agencies have contributed every scrap of information they have been able to gather on the mysterious incident. Reports from widely scattered areas have been forthcoming, but the object, which was said to have been so brilliantly lighted, has been described vaguely and variously.
REQUEST
It is requested that anyone who might have photos or motion pictures of the object to forward them to his organization at once, for study and analysis.
