1. DATE: 5 November 1957

2. LOCATION: San Antonio, Texas

3. DATE/TIME GROUP: Local night, GMT 05/15+52 (2)

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. SOURCE: Civilian

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 seconds

7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Oval shaped obj approximately 60 ft long. More blunt one end & similar to luminous light, but did not make a light on the surface of the ground. No trail. Observer states that he felt a gust of warm air as the object left the area with a swishing sound. Radio & lights on car went out & car engine stopped. As the car slowed down observer noticed a lighted object approx 200 yards to the left of the road hovering near the ground. Rose vertically in a NE direction.

9. COMMENTS: Probably the result of an over active imagination. (Following Sighting). Duration 7/only 3 secs. Obj has character of being stationary & hovering. Also error in time since sighting at night and 15-5 not consistent. Evaluation probably not conclusive. Additional description considered as unreliable.CONFID. DATA.

the manner of disappearance.

There was 300 foot ceiling with light
rain and fog. If it would be
impossible to see any data likely
