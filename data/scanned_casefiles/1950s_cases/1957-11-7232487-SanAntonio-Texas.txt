The observers comments on detection, sightings, directions or maneuvers of object/phenomena.

This is a 300-foot ceiling with light rain and fog. It is a wonder be visible to observer in certain areas. The object was silent in movement and is impossible to estimate size or speed of object but to ascertain it was definite control flight performed by some intelligent being.
