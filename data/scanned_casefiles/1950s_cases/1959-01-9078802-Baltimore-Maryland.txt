Dear Sir:

I have enclosed information on a mysterious object which I saw following an airliner. I hope if you can give me an answer to what we saw, you will let me know. I have yet to think that what I saw was not a flying saucer, but must have some logical explanation. I am aware you it was not any astronomical phenomena, because I am the president of the [blacked out] astronomical Society, and I know most of the astronomical objects, such as meteors, comets, or asteroids, and what they look like. Please if you can give me any information on this, please let me know.

Sincerely yours,
[signature blacked out]
