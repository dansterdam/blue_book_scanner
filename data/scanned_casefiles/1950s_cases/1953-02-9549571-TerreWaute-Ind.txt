Terre Haute, Indiana                                                1 February 1953

I. Description of Incident

A military aircraft, on a 270° heading 10 miles west of Terre Haute sighted a close group of moving lights changing color from red to blue, to green to yellow. The pilot estimated their altitude to range between 30,000 ft. to 15,000 ft. Flying in a manner similar to conventional aircraft. Searchlights from the St. Louis area seemed to be following the unidentified lights. The time of sighting was about 2130

II. Discussion of Incident

ATIC made a check on local aircraft and found that there were many commercial and military flights in and out of St. Louis at the time of sighting. It is possible that searchlights from St. Louis picked up one of these aircraft. The observing aircraft was 100 miles away from St. Louis which probably accounts for the changing color of lights.

III. Conclusion

Possibly aircraft.

Dear Sir:

Would you please send me the following information:
Why is the Flying Saucers secret?

In February 2, 1953, a York transport aircraft with thirty-three passengers and pilot and co-pilot, vanished over the Atlantic area, is worth through a cloud and came out in pieces? (Please explain).

Thank You
