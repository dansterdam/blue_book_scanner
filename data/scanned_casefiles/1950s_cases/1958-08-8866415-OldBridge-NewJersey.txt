To Whom It May Concern:

Last evening about 9:00 a few friends and I were observing an object in the sky for about 3 hours. We would like to know what it was.

Our location is Central Jersey, and the object appeared not very far above the North East horizon. It seemed to follow the same pattern of movement, going from side to side, covering a short distance. It would appear in the same place and disappear in the same place. It was very bright. Once it seemed to move in a complete circle.

We are all very curious and anything you can tell us would be appreciated.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
(Mr. & Mrs.) [redacted]
Old Bridge, N.J.

   1. There is very little information in Mr. and Mrs.       letter on 
          which to base a valid conclusion. However,^the following is submitted on which to 
          base a reply: 
/	a. At 9:00 P.M., EST, 27 August 1958, the star Alphertz, which is a 
          second magnitude star, was in the northeast, approximately 30 degrees above the 
          horizon. 
/	b. At 9:00 P.M., EST, same day, the planet Mars was just beginning to 
          appear above the northeastern horizon. 
/ c. In an area where there are a lot of exhaust fluzes of all types, as in 
          the observer's case, the heavenly bodies appear to play all sorts of tricks. 
/         d. It is the opinion of this office that the observers were looking at one 
          of the bodies mentioned above.

                                         17 September 1958

Dear Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 28 August 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object observed by you at Old Bridge, New Jersey, on 27 August 1958.

There is insufficient data on which to base a valid conclusion. However, the following is offered as a possible solution:

At 9:00 p.m., EST, 27 August 1958, the star Alpherats, which is a second magnitude star, was in the northeast, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.

At 9:00 p.m., EDT, same day, the planet Mars was just beginning to appear above the northeastern horizon.

In areas such as central New Jersey where industrial haze or exhaust fumes are present in the atmosphere, heavenly bodies can be mistaken for unconventional or unidentified flying objects. Therefore it is quite possible that you observed either the planet Mars or the star Alpherats on that date.

                                      Sincerely,

                                      LAWRENCE J. TACKER
