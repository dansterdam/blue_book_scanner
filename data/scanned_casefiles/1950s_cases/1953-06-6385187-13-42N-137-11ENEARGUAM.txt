UNCLASSIFIED 
FLYCRAFT
SIGHTING NEAR GUAM (12-42N 137-11E)
17 June 1953
Major John E. Rhodes, USAF

PAGE FLYCRAFT #3, based on information forwarded in INTSUM, dated 3 June 1953, from Naval Air Station: Agana, Navy 913. Distribution to MAT3 headquarters; other neces - distribution to AIC.

Sources: Lt jg R.H. Tillow, USN 433996
          Lt jg W.A. Flaherty, USN 503435

Salianella Intelligence: 
1. At 2355, 5 June 1953, in area 12-42N-137-11E at 3,000 feet while flying MA3 F4-23-705, the aircraft commander, Lt. JG. R.H. Tillow, USN, observed a green light. The light was first observed at a distance of approximately 10 miles. The green light came from above and behind the aircraft and was on a collision course with the aircraft. The green light came to within 100 feet of the aircraft and then made an instantaneous 90 degree turn and disappeared. The green light was observed at a distance of approximately 20 miles. The color of the light was a bright emerald green. 

2. At 1430, 5 June 1953, in area OPEN 12-42N-137-11E, at an altitude of 5,000 feet, while descending, Lt. Jg. W.A. Flaherty, USN, observed a bright light. The light appeared to be larger than a star and was traveling at a high rate of speed. The light made an abrupt 90 degree turn and disappeared.

COMMENTS: It is believed by the reporting officer that what the two aircraft commanders have observed is a portion of an interplanetary craft. Numerous sightings have been reported by other MAT3 personnel in recent dates. It is suggested this matter be given adequate attention by the intelligence agencies in view of the grav- ity of the observations.
