Scientific Intelligence

1. At 132002, 5 June 1953, in area 1342N - 137lls at 9,000. feet while flying 
MATS trip P 230/04, the aircraft commander, Lt/JG R. W. Hagen observed a green light 
which appeared to extend over a considerable area. The object was moving too slowly 
for a meteor and too fast to be a flare. At 1340Z, green light was observed ahead 
at a distance of approximately 20 miles. The green light came from above 
12,000 feet, plus-minus approximately 1,000 feet. The green for miles around.

2. At 1420Z, 5 June 1953, in area 0922N - 162233, at altitude of 3000 feet, while 
flying MATS trip P-231/04, the aircraft commander, Ltud. P. A. Tufo, observed what 
seemed to be a green flare at flight level.

Comment: It is believed by the preparing officer that what the two aircraft 
commanders can view a portion of a meteor burning itself out in the atmosphere, since 
numerous meteors have been observed by other MATS personnel on recent dates. It is 
not felt that this sighting was a distress signal since there were no reports of any 
other aircraft or surface vessels in distress in this vicinity at this time.
