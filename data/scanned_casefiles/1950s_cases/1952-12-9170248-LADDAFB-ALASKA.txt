9. COURSE: WSW

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
White oval shaped object (light) traveled at a noticeable speed on straight course on a 240° heading. Obj moved to change from white to red as if atmosphere had something to do with it as it gained altitude. Obj then took a 160° heading rapidly speeded until it appeared as falling star falling to the earth.

11. COMMENTS:
1. Too long for a meteor.
2. No a/c were reported in area.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
(Various checkboxes, with none specifically marked)

characteristics. The color of the light seemed to change from white to red as if the atmosphere had an effect on it as it gained altitude. Object unidentifiable due to darkness of night, speed of object, and position of observer. Object not audable. When on ground, nothing of a motor, engine, or other propulsion nature was noticed. Temperature approximately -22° and noise could be (have been) heard at very long distances with no wind at that temperature. Upon landing, (Note: After F-94 landed) the object moved in an erratic flight path for a period of three minutes until it was pointed out again to the pilot and a ground crew members.(???) Then it took up a heading of 160° gaining speed until it looked like a falling star or meteor. Descending all the time, it continued to become a brighter red as it reached the earth. The light appeared to diminish its forward speed and descent to the earth as a helicopter would. At this point the light was noticeably more red than before. Time: 090616½ to 090626½.

Weather conditions: Night, VFR CAVU.

1. Reference is made to TWX, this headquarters, date-time-group 10/022B2, Dec 1952.

2. The following summary is a synopsis of information obtained both by interrogation and by a statement made by the observers, which is attached as Enclosure No. 1.

(a) The object observed was a 11 it appearing to be approximately one half to one mile away, a landing craft at a distance of one half to one mile away, distance decreasing at one point to 200 yards as indicated on Enclosure No. 2. Flight was much more intense and larger than a star. No filament or directional beam were notable. The object was white at that point.

(b) Time of sighting was from 09/0612Z to 09/0326Z.

(c) The object was not observed by anything other than visual means. It was first observed by Lt. Daylea, the Radar Operator, who called the pilots attention to it. Throughout the landing maneuvers, Lt. Davies kept it in sight, except during approach and during touchdown. Speed of the observing aircraft (an F-94A) varied from 230 MPH when the object was first sighted to 110 MPH at time of original sighting. The aircraft was at an altitude of 3,000 ft.

(d) Observations were made at Ladd Air Force Base. For headings of aircraft and object, see map attached hereto as Enclosure No. 2. When first sighted, the object was located with the aircraft and approximately 200 - 1000 yards distant from the aircraft. The object's altitude beyond its flight is estimated at approximately 2000 ft. and up.

(e) The object was observed by 1st Lt. Thomas W. Davies, Radar Observer, and 1st Lt. Donald A. Dickman, Pilot. Lt. Davies has been flying in this theater for 1½ years, Lt. Dickman for 2 years, 3 months. Both are regarded as reliable witnesses.

(f) The weather was CAVU with negligible winds. Temperature was -22°.

(g) There is no activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise known at this time which might account for this sighting. Further investigation is being conducted at this base to determine any possibility along this line, and any further information, if developed, will be forwarded in a supplemental report.

(h) No physical evidence has been developed in connection with this sighting.

(i) No interception or identification action was taken due to a recall of the aircraft during an alert at the time.

(j) After landing, the Radar Observer and the Pilot watched the object fly off in a south-westerly direction; making the last directional change indicated on the map, end dive swiftly toward the ground disappearing behind intervening buildings. Lt. Davies then went to the operations office and called Ladd tower and Crane Control to see if any aircraft were reported in the vicinity at the time of his observations. He was given a negative report in both instances.

3. a. Unidentified airborne object (light) heading approximately 240° at 2,000 feet altitude. On straight course for approximately one (1) minute then it started increasing its speed noticeably, approximate size of large cabin light or two (2) engine transport or diffused light of that nature. Shape non-reflective, white in hue oval in shape. Altitude 2,000 feet. Continued on 240° heading at 2,000 ft altitude for approximately two (2) minutes. No jet or rocket stream noticed.

b. Serial number 49-2522, heading 060°, F-94A, land-jet, one engine, USAF insignia, 2,000 feet altitude, speed 200 knots per hour. Name Starfire, serial number 49-2522.

c. Not applicable.

4. Aircraft serial number 49-2522, F94A, 1st Lt Donald A. Dickman pilot, 1st Lt Thomas W. Davies radar observer, was on base leg to approach for landing when 1st Lt Davies called attention to pilot of a target at 11:30 o'clock some altitude, target moving from starboard to port. Target affirmed by pilot. The F-94A was heading 060°, target was heading 240° approximately parallel and 150° to fighter flight.

During the next 30 to 45 seconds, target increased its speed noticeably. When F-94A, serial number 49-2522, turned on base leg, heading approximately 240°, target continued on heading approximately 240° same altitude. From position of base area target seemed to ascend at a phenomenal rate with a straight course and very erratic flight characteristics. The color of the light seemed to change from white to red as if the atmosphere had an effect on its altitude. Objectionable due to darkness of night, speed of object, and position of observer. Object not audible. When on ground, nothing of a motor, engine, or other propulsion nature was noticed. Temperature approximately minus twenty-two (-22) degrees and any noise could be heard at a very long distance with no wind at that temperature. Upon landing, the object moved in an erratic flight path for a period of three (3) minutes until it was pointed out again to the pilot and two (2) ground crew members.

Then it took up a heading of 160° gaining speed until it looked like a falling star or meteor. Descending all the time, it continued to become a brighter red as it reached the earth. The light appeared to diminish its speed and descended to the earth as a helicopter would. At this point the light was noticeably more red than before. Time 090605Z. Weather condition, night VFR CAVU.

1.    Reference is made to TWX, date-time 110645Z, this headquarters, symbol LF'WF-3.

2.    The following information, submitted in accordance with Air Force Letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952 is presented in conformity therewith as a summary of the information contained in the transcript of Inclosure 1.

    (a) Object sighted consisted of a white light, oval in shape. Size could not be determined, except that it was much larger than any visible star. It ranged in color from white to blue (bluish-white). Only one object appeared. No aerodynamic features were observed, since no silhouette was seen. No accurate estimate of speed can be made since distance of object was unknown; however, observers felt it was very much faster than any jet aircraft. No exhaust or means of propulsion was visible.

    (b) Time of sighting was 11/C/417Z. No positive check can be made on duration of observation, but observers estimate the total elapsed time from four to ten seconds.

    (c) Observation was visual only, from the air. Aircraft was a EC-3, flying at 9,000 feet at approximately 150 M.H.

    (d) Observation was made at approximately 146° 25', 64°N. Light was first seen at approximately the 9 o'clock position and leaving in level flight from right to left, disappearing when in the 9 o'clock position. It appeared to be at approximately 12-13,000 feet altitude; however, since distance of object was

from the aircraft was not known, definite altitude cannot be ascertained. After circling approximately a 100 arc of visibility, the object disappeared abruptly with no trail or trace. At the time of the observation, the aircraft was on a heading of approximately 260° magnetic, and the object traveled in a southwesterly direction.

(e) Observers were _____ Captain, and _____ Co-pilot of flight 100, Alaska Air Lines, coming from Seattle. Both are very experienced, having flown in this territory for from six to seven years, and are considered to be extremely reliable. Captain _____ has had prior experience in such sightings, having been an observer to a much more detailed sighting several years ago over Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, which received much publicity at the time.

Co-pilot _____ who was standing in the aisle of the flight deck at the time did not see the object, but noticed the pilot's and co-pilot's heads turning to watch the object.

(f) Weather was clear, with winds less than 10 knots, variable, and temperature was -1°.

(g) At the present time, no condition, with a meteorological or other which might account for the sighting is known; however, local sources are being checked for this information and if an affirmative answer is found, this information will be forwarded in a separate, supplemental report.

(h) No physical evidence is available.

(i) No interception or identification action was taken other than a rather tardy attempt at electronic surveillance, for the reason that the initial report was not made until some time after the landing at the aircraft.

(j) Pilot called Ladd Tower immediately after the sighting and requested information regarding any other aircraft in the area of the sighting and was given a negative answer. He was told that there were three aircraft in the vicinity of Ladd making their approaches.

SUBJECT: Interrogation of Unidentified Flying Objects     11 December 1952

The following is a transcript of an interrogation made 11 December 1952, 
at the Northward Hotel, military personnel present: Lt Col William Brown, 
Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and Training, Maj John Allshorn, Wing 
Intelligence, Maj Walter Henry, Wing Weather, personnel interrogated: 
Captain [redacted], Pilot; co-pilot, [redacted] and co-pilot [redacted] 
of Alaska Air Lines. (Pilot, co-pilot of which Air Lines was also present.)

Q. Where were you when this happened?
A. We were half way between Fig Delta and Sielow. [redacted] was standing 
in the aisle between us when this darn thing came across from about one 
o'clock.

Q. How long was this visible?
A. Pilot: Only for about three or four seconds.
   Co-pilot: I could see it for about ten seconds; I took my eyes off it 
   to look at [redacted] the pilot, then looked back at the object again and 
   could see it until last, it just over the wing.

Q. What direction was it going, in?
A. It was going in a straight line, horizontal to the horizon, toward 
   the left wing.

Q. What color was this?
A. It was a blue, greenish white.

Q. Was there any shape to it other than the light?
A. No, we could just cut out the lights.

Q. What time did this take place?
A. It was just about 610 or 615.

Q. How far away did it appear?
A. Suddenly, say because there was nothing to compare it to. The crew 
   that saw it the other night might be able to give you a better description 
   since they saw it below the overcast.

   When Air Lines, I saw one about a year and a half ago up 
near Northway. The radio called us and asked if we had seen anything. 
The stations at Northway and Lahard could not see it from the ground. I was 
about ten or eleven o'clock at night. This it is roughly the same as 
these guys described it. It never faded or anything. It traveled in a

very horizontal path from Northway toward Galena.)

Q. Did this one the other night impress you in any way as far as distance?
A. Just that it was going like hell.

Q. It didn't give you any feeling of how far or how close?
A. I would say it was about twelve thousand feet, but no couldn't tell how far it was away. I could see the lights of Ladd and Eielson and it was bigger than any light I've would make out. At about 14 to 15 miles light - there was no beam to it.

Q. Was it rose intense or brighter than any star?
A. Yes, and bigger. It really amazed me because I never saw anything like it before. It was just horizontal and fast.

(Remainder of text partially obscured)

Q. Does it give you any directions about reporting these things?
A. They never said anything. We were going to call it but we didn't know just what to say and we thought it was a lot of confusion. When we got on the ground, there was a reporter at Operations. He told him we didn't see anything. We saw five or six people on the same thing. It has to be something. We know that what was traveling, it would be in Seattle in about twenty-five minutes. We have had jet go by us and this seemed to be going four or five times as fast as a jet.

(Also saw one at Ladd a couple of years ago over the airport at about three hundred feet. Everyone must have seen that one. It looked like a big cigar with lights, with about fifteen turbos sticking out of the back of it. The officers up in the tower were looking at it with glasses.)

Q. What was your first impression of this one that you saw the other night?
A. We thought it might be a missile, but there were no traces behind it.

Q. How long have you been flying up here?
A. We have all been flying up here about five or six years and we have never seen anything like this that before other than what we have mentioned.

ATIC DOCUMENT 103473 is a report of unidentified vapor trail observed by 3 officers at the Narsarsuak Air Base in Greenland at 1607Z on 12 Dec 52. The report goes on to evaluate the vapor trails as being possibly those from a hostile aircraft on a reconnaissance mission. States that this is the second time reported unidentified vapor trails have been observed in a three-day period over Greenland.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

PROBLEM: To obtain additional information on the reporting of contrails sightings in Greenland 10 and 12 December 1952.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION:

2. Received message AFOIN 27501 which was garbled, AFIN 27525 dtd 10 Dec 52 was corrected copy. These were followed by AFIN 27571 confirming cable (from Sonderstrom AFB Greenland).

3. Received AFIN 28916 dated 12 Dec 52 from Narsarssuak AB Greenland.

4. Cables received 10 Dec indicated contrails heading of 360° which would not indicate hostile aircraft proceeding towards the U.S.

5. Cable received 12 Dec contained insufficient information to make a flash evaluation. Investigation revealed no SAC, MATS or Canadian aircraft could have been involved. At the date time group stated in this cable are correct. Navy is continuing to investigate if it could have been one of their aircraft.

6. The Command Post obtained information that three F-86s landed at Narsarssuak at 1450 Zulu, 12 Dec on a classified mission. There is a possibility that these aircraft could have been responsible for the reported contrails due to a discrepancy in the reported time.

7. A check with the weather service at Andrews AFB revealed that between 1200 and 1800 Zulu, 12 Dec, the visibility was 15 miles and the ceiling varied from 5 to 6 thousand feet with 10/10ths stratus cumulus. While it is possible that contrails could have been seen below the overcast by these ground observers, it is certain that the aircraft could not have been more than 15 miles and possibly much closer. Further information concerning the contrails is so vague that it is questionable if contrails could have been observed.

8. The provisions of paragraph 203 of JANAP 146 B were only partially complied with in Cable 27571 from Sonderstrom AFB.

9. While the report from Narsarssuak does not fall into a CIRVIS category since it was not observed from the air, the information required in the case of CIRVIS messages should have been reported.

10. Cable 28916 from Narsarssuak indicates that the cable was prepared for dispatch at 1100 Zulu reporting an incident that occurred at 1657 Zulu of the same date. It was dispatched from Greenland at 1617 Zulu and received here at 1809 Zulu. The discrepancy of time and preparation and the time of sighting indicates either a capable or typographical error either in time or date. The fact that both sightings occurred within

seven minutes of the same time of day at approximately the same place could have been a possibility that there may have been the same sighting. All messages were sent under flash priority which is the highest priority and will put them through any circuit immediately. JANAP 146B provide for sending such information in the clear with an emergency priority. As a result of this improper use of flash priority considerable anxiety was caused in Headquarters, USAF.

ACTION:

11. CG ADC was advised bypriority cable that no further information was available in this Headquarters.

12. Attached message was prepared for dispatch to CG NEAC requesting additional information.

FLYO BRPT                                                        16 December 1952

1.  Object sited was a light, comparable in size, intensity and color to a large bright star. No aerodynamic "nature" trail or exhaust or propulsion was seen. Speed varied from very fast to very slow - no approximation can be made since the distance of the light from the observer cannot be accurately established. Size and intensity of light appeared to diminish as it traveled its northerly course.

2.  Time of sighting was from 17/0555Z to 17/0615Z (local time 1955 hrs. to 2015 hrs. on the 16th of Dec.) with intermittent disappearances.

3.  Observation was visual from the ground, no optical or electronic equipment was used.

4.  See attached map for approximate movements of objects. General direction should be fairly accurate, however, since distance is not known it must be kept in mind that the observed locations as shown on map are only an inaccurate estimate.

5.  A/1c RICHARD A. LOWE, 74th Air Rescue Sqdn. (on outside guard duty at 74th Air Rescue Sqdn.) was first to observe light and saw it for the longest length of time. He has been in this theater 13 months. This 1st first experience with unidentified flying objects and no evaluation can be made as to his reporting reliability.

A/1c RICHARD J. KOACH, 74th Air Rescue Sqdn. (on inside guard duty) was shown light by A/1c LOWE. He has been in this theater 17½ months. This has first experience with unidentified flying objects and no evaluation can be made as to his reporting reliability.

1st Lt. LEROY P. OAKLEY, 74th Air Rescue Sqdn. (on duty as duty controller) was shown the light by the above mentioned airman who had completed better than half of its course. Lt. OAKLEY has been in this theater 22 months and from his experience in flying should be a qualified person to report such observations. However, since he observed the object for only a short duration, he does not have too much to report.

6. Scattered clouds at 12,000 feet, solid overcast at 20,000 feet, temperature 00 to -100, winds negligible.

7. No activity or condition known which would account for this sighting.

8. No physical evidence available.

9. No action taken by observers or alert Air Defense Center or surveillance agencies. It was not reported to organizations' Intelligence Section until late the following day.

10. Check of Base Operations by personnel preparing this report determined that there was no conventional air traffic in the area from 17/0515/ to 17/2045/.

1. Position of observers throughout observation.

2. General direction (line of sight) in which light was first noticed at 1955 hrs. (1)

3. Point at which observer estimated light to be at time of original observation. At this time it had a definite up and down motion. He ascertained this by its position over a nearby telephone pole.

4. Broken red lines (← → ←) denotes light's course and distance as estimated by observers.

5. Red line denotes general direction (line of sight) at which A/1c LONG was joined by A/1c ROACH in observation at approximately 2000 hrs. LONG states object traveled very swiftly (faster than jet) when first starting from point (3) and then slowed down to a barely perceptible movement before arriving at the intersection of lines (4) and (5). At this point the light blinked off momentarily and LONG requested ROACH (who was just inside the Bldg.) to come out and observe. Light continued in same general direction and very slowly with a discernible ascent to line (6) at which time it again momentarily blinked out. At this time Lt. OAKLEY (also in the hangar) was requested to come outside and observe. This was at approximately 2005 hrs.

6. From line (6) to (7) all three (3) observers watched light ascending slowly until it disappeared at intersection (7).

7. At intersection (7) it disappeared and was seen again at approximately point (8) by LONG and KOACH, and disappeared shortly thereafter.
