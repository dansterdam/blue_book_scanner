The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a case related to a UFO sighting in Atlantic City, New Jersey on 25 October 1954.

Here is the text from the document:

SUMMARY OF ATLANTIC CITY CASE

On 25 October 54, a memo was received in ATIC-5 from the 
AF Press Desk, Washington. Attached to the memo were several 
Atlantic City Newspaper Clippings dated 30 July 1954, relating a 
UFO report. The object had been seen by approximately 300 persons 
in the Atlantic City area on 29 July 1954.

There were no significant characteristics concerning the 
description or performance of the object, and quite a number of 
persons had reported the object "hovered" over the area for 
1-1 hours.

The above description, "hovered," immediately indicated the 
possibility of a balloon. The file on balloon launchings and tracks 
was referred to for possible launchings made on/about the 25/27 
of 28 July 54.

An experimental balloon was launched on 27 July 54 in the 
vicinity of Manchester, New Hampshire. Refer to attached map which 
depicts the approximate flight path of the balloon.
