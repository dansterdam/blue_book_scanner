29 October 1954

SUMMARY OF ATLANTIC CITY CASE

On 25 October 54, a memo was received in ATIAR-5 from the AF Press Desk, Washington. A, tached to the memo were several Atlantic City Newspaper Clippings dated 30 July 1954, relating a UFO report. The object had been seen by approximately 300 persons in the Atlantic City area on 29 July 54.

There were no significant characteristics concerning the description or performance of the object, and quite a number of persons had reported the object "hovered" over the area for 1½ hours.

The above description, "hovered," immediately indicated the possibility of a balloon. The file on balloon launchings and tracks was referred to for possible launchings made on/about the 26, 27 or 28 July 54.

An experimental balloon was launched on 27 July 54 in the vicinity of Manchester, New Hampshire. Refer to attached map which depicts the approximate flight path of the balloon.
