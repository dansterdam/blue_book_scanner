About size of average star, brighter than star. First looked like falling star until it stopped and hovered for approx 2 min, it then moved and stopped again for 1 or 2 min, it repeated this movement again a total of 1 times together.

Shapeless light, white no sound, moved like "falling star". Approached NE, stopped and hovered on several occasions, after each hover it made a radical change in course. During hovering, light appeared to rock and sway.

11. COMMENTS
Rate of speed, faster than any jet a/c.

TO THE DIRECTOR THE TOTAL SIGHTING IS NEGATIVE 15

A/C QUITE THE MOST QUALIFIED OBR. WHILE THE OBSERVATION IS

ACQUAINTED WITH THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJ. WAS AT AN ESTIMATE 5-7000 FT

OR HIGHER WHEN FIRST SEEN THE OBSERVER FELT QUITE, IT WAS A WELL-

PAST AND VIEW A/C UNTIL IT STOPPED MOMENTS. THE CENTER OBSERVED

PHYSICALLY NOTED HIS POSITION IN ATTEMPTING TO GET ASSISTANCE BY

CORRELATING THE SIGHTING AND A LESS QUALIFIED OBSERVER WITH THE

OBJ. IN VIEW FOR AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF TIME. THE SIGHTING

TERMINATED WHEN THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJ. MADE A VERTICAL CLIMB OUT

OF SIGHT. MANNER OF SIGHTING WAS VISUAL THE OBSERVERS WERE

1 M/SGT, HIS WIFE AND AN AIRMAN. THEY WERE IN THE HOUSING AREA

OF MARCH AFB. THE WEATHER AT TIME OF SIGHTING: NO SCATTER 1°

SCATTERED 1° MILES VIS. AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING THERE WAS "T" ANY

ACTIVITY ON THE AIR DROME OR IN THE AIR A FEW MIS. AFTER THE

SIGHTING A B-29 A/C PASSED LOW THRU THE AREA. THE ONLY B-29

KNOWN IN AREA WAS A B-29 AF3127 WHO ACCORDING TO MARCH TOWER

PARKED AT 23377 ON 11 OCT. 55. A CHECK OF LOGS AT M-23 SHOWS THE

ONLY THING THEY HAD IN THEIR AREA WAS A C-118 MATS 33269 AT

17,200 FT OVER ST ANDREWS AT @3167.
