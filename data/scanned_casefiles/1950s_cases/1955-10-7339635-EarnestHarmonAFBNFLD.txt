TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

THE TOTAL DURATION OF SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY 20-25 MINUTES. THE OBJECT WHICH FIRST APPEARED WAS A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WHICH GRADUALLY INCREASED IN SIZE. IT WAS AT AN ESTIMATED DISTANCE FROM THE OBSERVERS OF 25 HIGHER THAN FIRST SEEN. THE OBJECT THEN SPLIT INTO TWO AND SUBSEQUENTLY BROKE UP INTO FIVE FAST AND HIGH AS UNTIL IT STOPPED SUDDENLY. THE OBJECT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, REDDISH IN COLOUR AND APPEARED TO BE METALLIC, REFLECTING LIGHT IN ITS POSITION AS ATTEMPTING TO GET BEHIND THE CLOUDS. IN THEIR VIEW FOR AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF TIME. THE SIGHTING TERMINATED WHEN THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT MADE A VERTICAL CLIMB OUT OF SIGHT. MANNER OF SIGHTING WAS VISUAL. THE OBSERVERS WERE 1 MAJOR, HIS WIFE AND AN AIRMAN. THEY WERE IN THE HOUSING AREA AT ERNEST HARMON AFB. THE WEATHER AT TIME OF SIGHTING WAS REPORTED AS 4-5 SCATTERED CIRRUS MILES. AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY ON THE AIR DRONE OR IN THE AIR A FEW MILES. AFTER THE SIGHTING A T-33 A/C PASSED LOW THRU THE AREA. THE ONLY T-33 KNOWN IN AREA WAS A T-33 AT HARMON TOWER ENGAGED AT 23,377 ON 11 OCT, A CHECK OF LOGS AT M-33 SHOWS THE ONLY THING THEY HAD IN THEIR AREA WAS A G-1-19 AT 17,000 FT OVER ST ANDREWS AT 2216-7.
