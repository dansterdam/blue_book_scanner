1. Enclosed with the black and white negative and print is an enlarged color print which was developed from the enclosed color negative. This color print shows the traces which were outlined in color negative. There is no reason not to assume that the white streak across the sky is a vapor trail.

2. The two dark streaks accompanying the vapor trail are distorted in a similar manner as the two vapor trail but are not parallel to it. We do not have an explanation for the two streaks although one suggestion is that they are possible shadows of the vapor trail against clouds. We do not know if such a condition is possible. We also checked the film for possible photographic defects, but since we were limited to just the one frame we were unable to form any opinion.

Dear Sirs,

At approximately 4:15 P.M., Feb 12, 1959, I chanced to glance out of my window and noted that a jet plane had just passed overhead leaving a vapor trail. Next, it was noted that two objects had apparently cut through the layer of strata clouds cutting two very conspicuous swaths across the blue sky above.

The important thing was that the three lines were parallel so I immediately secured cameras to take a photograph, though this only took less than a minute. The former parallel lines were distorted due to the high wind.

The enclosed photographs should give you an idea of the situation.

This was the second time I have observed this. The first was last summer when I saw a 14th Air Force trail, follow an object and above the line. In both cases the plane and objects or object were traveling from SW to NE.

I am a UFA researcher and will appreciate an explanation of the phenomena.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted with black marker]

Dear Major Friend, yesterday, I wrote you a short note and indicated in the second paragraph that the tapes and photographs you received from me had not been returned by ATIC. I was in error, as they arrived perfectly yesterday.

If you a pleasure meeting with you and, I will consider it a privilege of all you personally in the future.
