Leaving home - walking toward car - facing west -
Saw Orange Star - bigger than Jupiter -
Was moving in a Westerly direction.
Turned car around to face East - sat & watched for
few minutes.

Turned car at least south - fixed window - heard
a sound like a drone - or more than one airplane -
no resemblance to sound I get on conventional type motor.
When the lights moved their eyes they disappeared,
the movement from east to west cut and turned, the
left light moved slight out & to and the right light
remained in at all times.

They were too close to gather to be same type of an
airplane. If the plane was really high the height would
not be as long could height as they appeared.

This person was looking toward Jupiter as he does frequently. Saw another light - orange tint - coming turned him 75°. Bearing - as it approached it appeared like two light. Went into have and fetched a home-made telescope. Definitely saw two light - could not tell whether they were joined or not. Light turned toward North of them only one light was visible. While covering the plane he saw light again - this time through window - came toward him of them. Undoubtedly.

RT 20.113; still talking telephone, the light appeared again about 5° higher than previously. Legs - about twice ago of Jupiter. Slowly moved West - could definitely see two light. No they moved overhead one light stopped on and the other was flashing. Had some sound to it - heading west and disappeared beyond woods toward Dayton.
