SUMMARY: (Enter condensed summary of report. One significant fact in first sentence paragraph. List inclosures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112 - Part II)

An unidentified brilliant white object was sighted off the coast of New Jersey at approximately 2045 Eastern Standard Time on 12 October 1952. The sighting aircraft was approximately 25 miles North of Atlantic City on a northerly heading and the object was over the water at approximately 12 o'clock. The GCI station was contacted and the controller vectored the aircraft toward the unidentified object. The airmen flew on a heading of 080 degrees toward the object for approximately 10 minutes apparently without getting any closer to the object. The lane picked up by the GCI station failed and the aircraft was directed to return to its home station.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. In accordance with AFR 200-5, 29 April 1952, the following report is submitted.

2. While on combat air patrol an unidentified brilliant white light was sighted off the coast of New Jersey at approximately 2045 Eastern Standard Time on 12 October 1952 between New York and Atlantic City at this time and the light was sighted at approximately 2 O'clock high. Object was first noticed to be a star not then considered as an uncontrolled object, but gradually lose altitude, and in comparison with stars in the area the object was far more brilliant. At this point the CGI station was called and asked if they had a contact on anything in that area. The controller reported that he had a faint contact and vectored an aircraft on a heading of 090 degrees which was within 2 or 3 degrees of a course which would have taken the aircraft straight for the unknown object.

3. The aircraft was on a heading of 210 degrees and at a reported distance of several miles. While flying toward the light at an indicated air speed of 250 knots, the bright object appeared to move gradually to the right and also gain in altitude to a position of approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the observers. Both observers at this time thought that the object could possibly have been an aircraft at great distance with its landing lights on. However, after flying toward the object for about 10 minutes, both observers agree that the object was a circular to egg shaped with what appeared to be a mid-wing with approximately 30 to 20 degrees dihedral. Directly below and as a part of the circular section there appeared a tail or cone shaped section of the same brilliant white light. This cone or tail seemed to vary in size, sometimes appearing short and then longer.

The object when described was likened to an F-86 aircraft standing on its nose except that while the fuselage of an F-86 is long and slim the object was oblong or egg shaped. The complex object as maintained above glided with the same brilliant white light. The object appeared to remain in the same general area and there was no indication of continuous, ground or maneuver with the exception of a gradual change in position in both elevation and azimuth, as described above. Observers suggested that the tail of white light which projected below the cylindrical portion which was a part of the object. Had it been an exhaust flame the color would have differed.

1. In accordance with AFR 200-5, 29 April 1952, the following report is submitted.

a. While on combat air patrol an unidentified brilliant white light was sighted off the coast of New Jersey at approximately 2045 Eastern Standard Time on 12 October 1952, Aircraft was approximately (25) miles North of Atlantic City at this time and the light was sighted at approximately 2 O'clock high. Object was at first believed to be a star but this was eliminated as a ground or ground object to gradually lose altitude, and in comparison with stars in the area the object was far more brilliant. At this point the CGI station was called and asked if they had contact on anything in that area.

The controller reported that he had a faint contact and was vectored on a heading of 080 degrees which was within 2 or 3 degrees of a course which would have taken the aircraft straight for the unknown object. The aircraft was an indicated altitude of 20,000 feet and the object was located approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the aircraft at a reported distance of several miles. While flying toward the light at an indicated air speed of 250 knots, the bright object appeared to move gradually to the right and also gain in altitude to a position of approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the observers. Both observers at this time thought they were possibly looking at some sort of aircraft at great distance with its landing lights on. However, after flying toward the object for about 10 minutes, both observers agreed that the object was a circular to egg shaped with what appeared to be a mid-wing with approximately 30 to 40 degrees of dihedral. Directly below and as a part of the circular section there appeared a tail or cone shaped section of the same brilliant white light. This cone or tail section appeared to very in size, sometimes appearing short and then longer.

[Hand-drawn sketches of "Tail Cone" with annotations]

The object when described was likened to an F-86 aircraft standing on its nose except that while the fuselage of an F-86 is long and slim the object was oblong or egg shaped. The complete object as a platform moves glowed with the same bright white light. The object appeared to remain in the same general area and there was no indication of continuous, sound or maneuvers with the exception of a gradual change in position in both elevation and azimuth, as described above. Observers could note no exhaust, no rotation or propulsion and the entire object glowed with a brilliant white light. Observers suggested that the tail of white light which projected from the main body of the object was cone or tail shaped since it was of the same color as the rest of the object. Had it been an exhaust flame the color would have differed. The CGI station finally lost contact with

a. Whenever object it had on its scope and also the aircraft did not appear to be pat-
ting any closer to the brilliant object, the controller directed the ovserving air-
craft to return to home base.

b. Object was first sighted at 2045 Eastern Standard Time 12 October 1952
and was under observation for approximately 20 minutes.

c. Observation was by visual means from an F-94B type aircraft at 20,000
feet indicated altitude with an indicated air speed of 250 knots. The object could
not be picked up by aircraft radar.

d. When object was first sighted, the observing aircraft was approximately
25 miles North of Atlantic City at 20,000 feet indicated. The object was
out over the water at approximately 2 o'clock and roughly 20 to 30 degrees above
the observing aircraft. Observers estimated the object to be at 50,000 feet and
several miles away.

e. Flying experience of observers is as follows:
(1) Robert Sonnett, Pilot, 2nd Lt, AC-2222849, total flying time 500
hours with 1 year 9 months operational.

(2) James W. Wallace, Radar Observer, 2nd Lt, AC-2224023, observer
time 150 hours with one year experience plus 11 months naval
aviation cadet pilot training and 150 hours student pilot time.

f. Weather at time of sighting, ceiling and visibility unlimited with
slight ground haze. Temperature at 20,000 feet indicated was 15 degrees.

g. It is believed no meteorological activity or condition can account for
the sighting.

h. No photographs were taken.

i. Interception action was as follows: Shortly after sighting the
bright object, the 646th AC&W Squadron was contacted and asked if they had picked
up anything in the area of this sighted object. The controller reported he was
faintly painting an object and then vectored the aircraft on a heading that was
aimed at 3 degrees of the unidentified object visually sighted. The aircraft
blew on the ground station scope finally faded and the P-94 aircraft was direct-
ed to return to its home station.

j. There were no other aircraft observed in the general area of the sight-
ing.
