I. A F102A FROM LANGLEY AFB RETURNING FROM AN INTERCEPTION WAS VECTORED INTO THIS AREA. AIRCRAFT REPORTED FLARES AND SHELL BURSTS FROM NAVAL VESSELS IN THIS AREA. A NAVAL AIRCRAFT (BEECHCRAFT) FROM OCEANA NAS WAS NEAR THIS AREA AND WAS VECTORED TO THE APPROXIMATE POSITION. AIRCRAFT REPORTED NO SIGHTINGS.

J. NO OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE IN THIS AREA AT THIS TIME.

K. BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY CLOSE POSITION OF THIS UNIT FROM THE POINT OF OBSERVATION, MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO OBSERVE THIS OBJECT FROM THIS LOCATION. VISUAL OBSERVATIONS, WITH THE AID OF FIELD GLASSES WERE MADE. IT APPEARED IN MUCH THE SAME MANNER AS REPORTED BY THE NAVAL PERSONNEL. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE INTELLIGENCE SECTION ARE THAT THIS SIGHTING WAS ON A PLANET OR STAR. ESTIMATE OF RELIABILITY BASED ON OBSERVATIONS BY THIS UNIT'S INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AND NCOICINTELLIGENCE CONFIRMING REPORT OF NAVAL PERSONNEL.

L. NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE.
