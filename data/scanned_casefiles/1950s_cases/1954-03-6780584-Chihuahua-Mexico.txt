The Director C.I.

This took place about seven or eight years before you (plural) conducted the first atomic experiment. There was (or "I was in") an army which was armed with suddenly appeared a flash and every soldier was converted into those such as those of the cigarette which he smoked. And many other things, which I have seen, take place in the spiritual world. In the years go by in the material (world).

Letter PL
The Director of Scientific Investigations

My attention being distracted for a moment on March 5, 1974, between 9:30 and 10 at night, I went into the courtyard of my home. As in the habit of watching the sky, suddenly I saw a blue object and later it produced a white glow of light and I observed that it was a product of colored lights (instead of white) that very same "sector". The next day, March 6, at 8:40, "not fall", went upstairs and observed it. I noticed that as it started it became smaller up to the point of becoming continued with the stars. I remained three about three minutes watching it, but the curious thing for me was that it glided away with an accelerating speed and when it was almost in front of me, it took on moving toward the south. If you were to place yourself as that your back was to the north, you would have found that it traveled from left to right producing a very perceptible screen, which I heard very well, and for another three minutes, as so, I watched it as it traveled in a constant direction.

With materialistic eyes,
Sincerely yours
