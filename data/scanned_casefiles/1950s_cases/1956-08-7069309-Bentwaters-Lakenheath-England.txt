TRANSCRIBED TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Dear Sir:

Reference your UFO study: you probably already have this item in your file, but, in case you don't, I will briefly outline it and you can contact me for full details if you want them.

I retired (30 years service) 1 April 1967 from the USAF. I have placed my name, rank, and serial number at the top of the page if you want to check on my authenticity. I had excellent clearance in the past (and still have a secret during the course of Air Traffic; I won't bother listing the types and locations, although I could supply all those if necessary).

I have never mentioned this incident, as I was pretty sure it is considered classified, and the only reason I feel free to give you details is because you are an official government agency.

On 13 August 1956 (approximately late September--I can't remember the exact date or month), I was on duty as Watch Supervisor at Lakenheath RAF Station (also USAF Station) in the Radar Air Traffic Control Center. It was the 5:00 p.m. to midnight shift, and we had either four or five other controllers on duty with me.

At about 10 minutes past midnight, the scope showed what at first appeared to be an unidentified aircraft traveling at tremendous speed northbound. It was estimated by the operators to be traveling about 4,000 mph. Anyway, it was picked up by our Sculthorpe GCA Unit calling on our radar, and the target was traveling at tremendous speed.

The pilot said they had checked with the London Control Center, and that nothing unusual was showing on their scopes. About 15 minutes later, the target went off our scope, but apparently reappeared about 30 miles southwest of Sculthorpe. It was then tracked by Sculthorpe GCA for about 30 minutes, after which it disappeared.

He said the tower-directed landing was aborted, and the object just appeared to be 50,000 feet at one instant and then at ground level the next. The aircraft immediately had all kind of electronic equipment malfunction and had to be escorted back to its starting point. I immediately had all the men keep careful logs on everything that transpired.

I called and reported all the facts to this point, including Sculthorpe GCA's initial report, to the 3rd Air Division Command Post at London. They in turn notified 3rd Air Force Command Post, and them hooked into the USAF chain of command.

I have never mentioned this incident, as I was pretty sure it is considered classified, and the only reason I feel free to give you details is because you are an official government agency.

Transcription of the text in the document:

I also hooked in with my local AFB Commanding Officer and my unit (AFCS) Communications Officer on my switchboard. And they were also listening in on this telephone conversation, and they had heard from the Radar Commander on my switchboard, and they all know of the facts concerning this incident and were conversant with the details of the report on the target's movements and location. The target made several changes in location, always maintaining an altitude of about 600 mph and always from movement from point to point. The movement varied from 8 miles to 20 miles in length - no set pattern as far as time. Time spent between movements also seemed irregular. The AFB was very busy answering questions - listening to theories, guesses, etc. that the conference line was carrying. This continued for some time. After I imagine about 30 to 45 minutes, it was decided to scramble two RAF Interceptors to investigate. This was done. The RAF interceptors came from the RAF Station. They got off after as I will mention later.

The interceptor aircraft took off from an RAF Station near London and approached Lakenheath from the southwest. Radio and radar contact was established with the RAF Interceptors at a point about 30 to 35 miles southwest of Lakenheath inbound to Lakenheath. On initial contact we gave the Interceptors all the background information from the UFO's (which was stationary at the time) distance and bearing from Lakenheath. The UFO we explained was much closer to the RAF Interceptors now than it had been when the information was first relayed to them. As the interceptors approached Lakenheath, the UFO (which appeared stationary) executed a very fast maneuver and at a tremendous rate of speed departed in a southerly direction. The interceptors were unable to turn quickly enough, or increase speed sufficiently, to overtake it. Also mentioned in the report were the details concerning the light which passed below them. Its altitude was 5,000 feet.

We instructed the RAF interceptors to guide them to the UFO. This was partly guesswork, rather than actual contact, since the UFO had now disappeared from radar. This vectoring of the interceptor was done in an attempt to establish visual or radar contact. Shortly after, we were told the intercept aircraft had lost the UFO and it was not re-acquired. The pilot said, "Roger, Lakenheath, I've lost it." There was nothing more heard from the intercept aircraft after that. The UFO had disappeared.

The text in the document reads as follows:

believe it varies and 200 to 600 feet is closer to the truth and, in addition, the timing of the appearance atmospheric conditions may also help determine
The interceptor pilot continued to try and shake the UFO for a considerable time (we could not communicate occasions! ly and we could not reach him over the radio, how long he was attempting to intercept the UFO we are not certain)
He finally said, "I'm returning to Station Lakenheath." As near as we can determine this was at 0122 Z. The pilot was never able to overtake the UFO and it finally disappeared from his radar.
Now let me report something which I have just learned. The officer who drove the interceptor (who stopped and chased the UFO) has been interviewed here (in London) and he advised the interceptor that the UFO target lost all power during the chase, that it appeared to stop and hover, then suddenly accelerate to a fantastic speed.
 number two interceptor pilot could not get closer than about 1 mile, he was never able to close on it.
whatever it was, it was maneuvering in a most incredible fashion - like nothing we have ever tracked before. I am disturbed because we had his radar on it and yet he could not get within range to do anything about it. He felt quite certain that this was a solid object - not some freak radar target.

Dear Sir:

I have your letter of March 4th and I note your inquiry concerning our interest in the unidentified objects sited over Bentwaters and Lakenheath, England on August 13-14, 1956.

These occurrences were of considerable interest to us and we pursued the matter thoroughly. Unfortunately the information obtained was somewhat fragmentary and inconclusive. It would appear that Air Force radar and air defense personnel made repeated visual and radar observations of unidentified objects in the Bentwaters-Lakenheath area on these dates. The objects reportedly displayed high speed, extreme maneuverability and other performance characteristics which could not be readily explained or associated with any known aircraft.

However, while the observations were numerous and made by highly reliable observers, we were unable to obtain data which would positively identify the nature and origin of the objects. The Air Force investigation, while extensive, produced no definitive findings. The possibility that the objects were of extraterrestrial origin was considered but not firmly established.

I regret that I cannot provide you with more definitive information on this intriguing incident. Our knowledge remains limited and inconclusive. If any additional pertinent data should come to light, I will be pleased to inform you.

Sincerely yours,

(redacted)
Chief, ATIC

Locating an area to the west, which appeared to be about 4 to 6 miles distant, a grayish white object, luminous in appearance, was observed moving through the sky at a high rate of speed. The object was circular in shape and about the size of a basketball. It appeared to make a soft humming sound. After about 15 seconds the object suddenly went out, leaving a trail of white smoke or exhaust in its wake. The incident was reported to the authorities. Weather conditions at the time were clear and calm.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Reference is made to my letter of 20 November 1956 in which I stated that I would send you the finalized material on the Lakenheath case. The enclosed is the final information regarding this incident.

I am relieved to find that they carry it under an unclassified category. This, of course, is gratifying to all concerned.

I have included a rough plot of the three radar and one visual observation. These sightings, in my opinion, cannot be satisfactorily explained as conventional targets. These sightings, in my opinion, cannot be satisfactorily explained as conventional targets. These sightings, in my opinion, cannot be satisfactorily explained as conventional targets.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

SUBJECT: Report for RAIC - Two Sightings from Bentwaters. Lakenheath, England

1. On the basis of the information contained in the report as forwarded to this office, it is considered that the incident under reference does not warrant further investigation at this stage.

2. On the basis of the available information, the time at which the sightings occurred places them outside the period of darkness when most reported sightings of unidentified objects have occurred. The speeds reported and maneuvers observed are, however, within the capabilities of some conventional jet aircraft.

3. Inasmuch as the sightings have been reported to various military agencies in the United Kingdom, it is suggested that this matter be discussed in detail with the proper authorities concerned prior to any final action. It is believed that this procedure may result in obtaining additional information which could be of value in evaluating the reports. 

4. You may desire to express to the reporting individuals our appreciation of their having brought this matter to our attention. It may be advisable, however, to advise them that no further investigation appears to be indicated at this time, pending the results of any action by the United Kingdom authorities.

The text in the document is as follows:

AT BENTWATERS: - Colored object was observed visually for approximately 45 minutes. This object appeared to be orange-red in color and 20-30 feet in diameter. It was observed hovering at an altitude of between 500-1000 feet. Two pilots of the USAF interceptor squadron were vectored to investigate and made visual contact with the object. After approximately 45 minutes, the object accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from view. Ground observers on the base also confirmed the sighting.

THIS IS CONFIRMED by the original intelligence report which states that our radar observed the aerial lghting. Ground observers watched the same object through optical trackers. Radar picked it up later than the visual observers, but lost track of it as the object accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed. Visual sightings were confirmed as being of the same object. Observers were trained personnel. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and was observed over an extended period of time. Under atmospheric conditions, the object could not have been a meteor, shooting star, or any other celestial object. This event remains unexplained.

2. Dr. Hynek was in agreement with the undersigned's comment to the SAC Commander in England and Headquarters USAFE, considering the many variables and other seemingly conflicting data involved in the UFO report.
3. Upon receipt of this sighting, Dr. Hynek was unavailable to review this report at the time of the application to the undersigned for guidance from the Harvard University Authority for satisfying the inquiry from the U.S. Astronomical Society Conference held in Berkeley, Calif.
4. The following action was taken in an attempt to resolve this matter:
a. Copies of all teletype messages from England were left in the custody of Dr. Hynek (deposited in safe in classified material assigned Dr. F. L. Whipple, Director of Astrophysical Observatory). A hand receipt signed by Dr. Hynek obtained the UFO case file.
b. Dr. Hynek will discuss the matter with Dr. Whipple who is in charge in Boston-Cambridge and with Dr. Hawkins, British astronomer-physicist, now with the observatory in Cambridge. Dr. Whipple is considered the foremost authority on satellite observations (if astronomical bodies is the world). With Dr. Hawkins participating an interested party (the undersigned UFO observer and experienced astronomer from England), the conference should produce something of note. This conference arranged by Dr. Hynek will be no expense to USAF.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DECLASSIFIED BY AUTHORITY OF
DATED 27AUG1956
LOCATION: Bentwaters, England
DATE: 29 August 1956
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects
SUMMARY: 
On the night of 13-14 August 1956, at approximate 2230 hours, unidentified luminous objects were sighted in the sky over RAF Station Bentwaters, England, and RAF Station Lakenheath, England. The objects were tracked on radar by both stations and observed visually by the pilots and ground control personnel. One object in particular was tracked on radar and visually observed descending to a low altitude, hovering briefly, and then accelerating at a high rate of speed. The unidentified objects were also observed and tracked on radar at RAF Station Sculthorpe.
DETAILS: 
At approximately 2230 hours on 13 August 1956, the RAF Radar Station at Bentwaters, England, picked up several unidentified targets on their radar screens. The targets were also observed visually by the pilots and ground control personnel at the station. The radar operators tracked the targets for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, during which time the objects made several abrupt changes in speed and direction. One object in particular was observed descending rapidly to a low altitude, hovering briefly, and then accelerating at a high rate of speed and disappearing from sight.
Simultaneously, the RAF Radar Station at Lakenheath, England, also picked up several unidentified targets on their radar screens. These targets were also visually observed by the pilots and ground control personnel at that station. The radar operators at Lakenheath tracked the objects for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, during which time the objects made several abrupt changes in speed and direction.
The unidentified objects were also observed and tracked on radar at RAF Station Sculthorpe.
The radar operators at all three stations reported that the unidentified targets displayed characteristics that were not consistent with known aircraft. The objects were able to make abrupt changes in speed and direction that were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.
CONCLUSION:
The unidentified objects observed over RAF Stations Bentwaters, Lakenheath, and Sculthorpe on the night of 13-14 August 1956 remain unidentified.

2. At approximately 2300 hours on 13 August 1956, the RAF Radar Intercept Officer at Bentwaters reported that the Bentwaters and Lakenheath radar stations had detected a number of unidentified, high speed, high altitude targets over the area. The targets were observed to make abrupt changes in direction and speed, disappearing and reappearing on the radar scopes. These targets were tracked for a period of approximately 6 hours.

3. At about 0010 hours on 14 August 1956, one of the unidentified targets was observed to split into two distinct targets which then closed in on an R.A.F. fighter aircraft which was airborne and vectored to intercept the targets. The fighter pilot reported that as he closed on the targets, they executed a sharp turn and rapidly accelerated, pulling away from the fighter at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour.

4. The fighter pilot stated that the targets appeared to be solid, metallic, disc-shaped objects, approximately 30 feet in diameter. This incident lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes."

VISUAL SIGHTINGS

The following is a report concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects in the vicinity of Bentwaters and Lakenheath, England. The report is dated August 7, 1956.

The report states that on the night of August 13-14, 1956, at approximately 00:30 hours, an unidentified object was observed by the control tower personnel at the Royal Air Force Station, Bentwaters. The object was described as a bright light, moving rapidly through the sky. It was observed for approximately 15 minutes.

Simultaneously, at the Royal Air Force Station, Lakenheath, radar operators detected an unidentified target on their screens. The object was tracked for over an hour, moving at varying speeds up to 600-700 knots. Attempts were made to intercept the object with RAF fighters, but the fighters were unable to get a visual identification.

The report concludes that the visual sightings and radar trackings appear to be related and that the nature of the object or objects observed remains unidentified.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

19 August 1956

1. At approximately 2200 hours on 13 August 1956, radar operators at Bentwaters and Lakenheath Radar Stations, England, observed several unidentified targets on their radar scopes. The targets were tracked for two and one-half hours, and their speeds were estimated to be between 600 and 700 mph.

2. The targets were observed to make abrupt changes in course and speed, far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. The targets were tracked at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 feet. No visual sightings were made from either radar site.

3. Fighter aircraft from RAF Bentwaters were scrambled to intercept the targets but were unable to gain contact.

4. This incident was reported through regular intelligence channels to higher headquarters.

SUBJECT: (C) Evaluation of Lakenheath Reports (Cont) 

Meteors, however, do not account for all of the phenomena observed. Capt Gregory, who made subsequent returns because of the ionization of the object leaving the radar scope, believes that the unusual and unorthodox motion of these objects as observed by the radars have over in the past observed meteors on their scopes and, if so, how such racons are different from the ballistic trajectory noted.

7. Dr. Whipple and the writer discussed the Lakenheath incident in length. Dr. Whipple pointed out that inasmuch as these facts are later hours than the ground observers. This suggests needs clarification inasmuch as the intermediate other portions of the report which indicate that at least in certain times visual and radar sightings were simultaneous.

8. Dr. Whipple stated that as far as the report at hand is concerned, no obvious physical solution is suggested. He deepened the inadequacy of the typical UFO report as a scientific document. He further stated that the nature of such reports is not likely to change if the Air Force was serious in its attempts to resolve this problem, both scientifically and in the public mind. The officials considered that some additional scientific progress must come if the probability of arriving at such solutions is to be increased.

9. The present writer submits that it might be considerable, potential material is the raw data from which one must work and that is general the investigator in any scientific data. In short, Dr. Whipple asked the writer whether the contents of any other corroborating or otherwise witnesses bearing on the credibility of data and facts as precisely those areas from which the maximum UFO reports originate. The writer responded that this had indeed been suggested in the past but this was because of considerations of expenses and of possible public misinterpretation.

The writer responded that this had indeed been suggested in the past but this was because of considerations of expenses and of possible public misinterpretation.

The Lakenheath report could constitute a course of action as far as future public demands, if the Air Force was to make a factual analysis of the air-ground radar performance, and make the results known publicly. However, it is not believed that such a course of action would be fruitful owing to possible claims of a mysterious character photographed. This would be especially true if during the time of such UFO reports from untrained observers continued to come in from that area.

Text from the document:

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: (C) Evaluation of Lakenheath Reports

1. The original Lakenheath reports and the preliminary evaluations made by ATIC were submitted to the undersigned for examination, evaluation and comment. Visits were requested to discuss these with Dr. F.H. Seitz. Accordingly, Lt. Col. Duffy and the writer interviewed Lt. Col. Price and Major Johnson of the Air Force Security Service, in view of the fact that sightings occurred at the time of ferrell Beacon and Dr. Whipple is a recognized authority on meteors. Following comments will accordingly be invited to cover the three points.

2. It is to be regretted that no unusual a sighting report did not contain more specific information on which to base an evaluation. The Lakenheath report is one of the more unusual UFO reports involving electronic countermeasures and visual observations and subsequent activities by fighter planes. Yet, the report does not state whether it was definitely established that visual and electronic sightings were coincidental, even if they occurred for over an hour. Additional information would be extremely valuable for an evaluation which might enable one to charge weather conditions, with any precision relative to "anomalous propagation" such as frequently occur with radars.

3. It would be most valuable to have "independent statements from the various observers both at Bentwaters and Lakenheath". Report states that the "observers" are listed. Intelligence specialists. An analysis would be greatly aided by having independent statements from such highly trained observers as the original report indicates the observers were.

4. The implication of the original report is that the objects were sighted simultaneously by ground-visual, air-visual and ground-electronic means. Their apparent movements and direction of travel seem highly irregular. Angular rate of motion of objects is deduced not to have been consistent with normal aircraft.

5. With the above in mind, the preliminary reports submitted by Capt. Gregory appear to well summarize the evidence. The reason for this is, upon more detailed examination of the report, inconsistencies and discrepancies of the original report mentioned in paragraph 2 above seem highly unlikely. For instance, it seems highly unlikely that the Perceived meteors could have maneuvered in the manner described by the observers. Particular if the two phenomena, visual and electronics, were not definitely established to be coincidental. Certain aspects of the report seem to indicate that the apparent motion of the objects in the visual sightings were exceptionally slow, which is unusal for meteors. But additional information would be required to determine whether the two phenomena were indeed interconnected, and rules may be given to the answer of the objects as sighted visually are "anomalous propagation".

Visual Air Sighting: The two air pilots who were vectored to search the area claimed that visual contact was made with the object, which appeared as a clear white light, moving, and with apparent rapid acceleration. The performance beyond visual characteristics was considered by the pilots to be of considerable significance.
It appears to the air command authorities from this case that while certain meteorologic phenomena could account for portions of the observations, the totality of the information cannot be satisfactorily explained in meteorologic or aircraft terms. The first reports (approximately 1 hours in duration) appear conclusively to indicate sightings of an unusual nature which extend the capability of rational explanation in the form of presently known meteorologic and aeronautical phenomena.
As a result of witness interviews and study of the technical data, it appears that the physical and physiological characteristics of the sightings suggest strongly that they were not caused by natural meteorologic phenomena and its attendant optical effects. However, despite the apparently numerous and reliable witnesses, certain elements of the report cannot be conclusively established beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore the exact nature of the phenomenon observed cannot be determined with complete certainty.
On the basis of the above, the limited data provided, there is no material evidence which would conclusively prove the reality of these sightings. This is simply because the observations did not permit sufficiently complete and accurate data collection which could substantiate the existence of intelligently controlled air vehicles of unconventional origin. All that can be established is that certain unusual aerial phenomena were observed which have not yet been fully explained in terms of presently known physical principles.

ITEM: Capt. Gregory

From the information submitted, it is impossible to ascertain a determination of the sources of these sightings. Certain facts which are available, however, are indicative that the sightings were not any conventional type example, the fact that a number of ships appeared and disappeared simultaneously seems to indicate the possibility of a control or guidance and their characteristics of weather patterns is the disappearance of all of the objects in question at about the same time which would indicate a possible guided propagation. This also tends to preclude the possibility of the targets being material targets.

3. A more thorough analysis of these UFO sightings would be desirable, which would permit determination of actual conditions prevailing, such as temperature inversions, moisture data, and an accurate comparison related to known weather patterns. This could provide valuable clues to the actual causes of the sightings which were reported, which may have been natural phenomena and not necessarily anything unusual.

2. The reported sighting is considered and apparently could be explained as follows:
     a. The personne were observed and apparently could be interpreted as meaning they saw objects...
     b. The two personne are now of opinion they saw an aircraft..., during the period between 21st and 29th of August.
     c. In interviews afterwards, it seems the individuals might, at first, have overestimated about the observed object, but later, their impressions were considerably modified.

d. It is possible that the object sighted were Air Force aircraft conducting high altitude or supersonic flights in the area at that time.

e. Although collating the several reports, there does not appear to be sufficient evidence to indicate the presence of unconventional aircraft or missiles in the area during the period in question."

Apparently the lights were sighting to determine by ICAO/RAF.

The lights were variable and seemed to be maneuvering, but no definite conclusions could be reached as to their nature.

One object appeared to be from 10-15 miles in the distance and was observed to ascend to a high altitude very rapidly.

It is requested that complete details of this incident be furnished to the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

GIST: Most significant are the reports of three contacts of UFOS tracked on the Bentwaters GCA radar from approximately 12 miles, each time. These contacts were tracked at speeds varying from approximately 600 to 1200 miles per hour; a single UFO was tracked by the Bentwaters GCA from approximately 30 miles to 12 miles per minute, or more than 1,800 miles per hour; a third UFO was reported as tracked by the Bentwaters GCA from a distance of approximately 20 miles to a distance of 6 miles in less than 20 seconds, which gives an exceptionally high speed.
The GCA operators stated that these radar sightings were of the opinion that malfunctions or the GCA itself did not cause these radar sightings.
The following information was obtained from USAF personnel assigned to the 51st Fighter Bomber Wing. This information indicates the reliability of all the following sources of information is estimated to be usually reliable:

On 17 August 1956 the following information concerning subject Unidentified Flying Object was received from S/Sgt Lakenheath RAF Station Bentwater, England, Control Tower Shift Chief, 1254th AACS Squadron, RAF Station Bentwater. 
Sgt ___ initiated that his attention was first called to the object by its position, size and unusual color. He was also aware that the Bentwater GCA was tracking unidentified targets at the same time, but could not establish contact with them. The object was described as about the size of a pea held at arm's length, bright orange-red in color. It was first observed changing to bluish-white. No discernible details or structure were visible, and the object appeared only as a light. It was observed visually with the aid of 7 x 50 power binoculars. Time of observation was about 10 minutes. The object was in sight for about 2-3 minutes and then disappeared, reappearing in a different position. The observer felt the object was under intelligent control.
2/Lt___, 1364th AACS Squadron, RAF Station Bentwater, England reports the following information relative to subject Unidentified Flying Object:

Sgt ***** stated that 12 to 15 unidentified objects were tracked 
by Radar GCA (GROUND CONTROL APPROACH) station #2 at RAP BENTWATERS, 
1956.  This group was picked up approximately 8 miles southwest of 
RAP Bentwater, and they appeared to be traveling at approximately 
600-800 knots.  At the latter point on the course of these objects, 
they disappeared from the radar scope entirely.  One of the objects, 
however, was observed to leave the formation and descend at a very 
sharp angle and then return to the formation.  This individual object 
was observed to converge to one issue.  The larger object then were to the 
north and disappeared.

Lt ****** stated that the 12 to 15 unidentified objects were
tracked by 2 observers in the GCA (GROUND CONTROL APPROACH) Station at 
RAF Lakenheath.  The other objects were unidentified and did not 
conform to any known type or radar signature.  Airspeed of the object 
was estimated from 600-800 knots.

Sgt ****** advised that these objects appeared as normal targets on the GCA scope and that at times they were almost pin-point in size.  He stated that the unidentified objects in this report UNCLASSIFIED

The following information pertaining to an Unidentified Flying Object sighted on the Bentwater GCA at 2100Z, 14 August 1956, was submitted by the Operations Desk Officer, RAF Station Radio Lakenheath, England:

AIRMAN A indicated that he tracked the Unidentified Flying Object on the GCA radar from approximately 2100Z, 14 August 1956. The object traveled at an estimated speed of 400-700 MPH. The object maintained a level altitude. At one point the object disappeared from the scope, only to reappear shortly thereafter. The object was observed visually for a short period of time before again disappearing.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

REPORT NO.: 8-1-56
The unidentified flying object was picked up at an estimated 20 to 30 miles east-southeast of Bentwaters and flew a constant course of about 270 to the northeast at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 miles per hour. This speed was calculated by estimating the lapsed time that the object was in the vicinity of the VORTAC stations as approximately 20 miles west and it was estimated that the object covered this distance in approximately 1.5 minutes. The electronic counter measures and radar operators stated that some view of the speed of the object could be obtained by the revolution of the A/Z2 indicator, and that this indicated a speed of approximately 600 to 800 miles per hour.
The unidentified flying object was tracked by two separate radar stations VORTAC and CPS-5 in the vicinity of Bentwaters and Lakenheath, England. These radar stations tracked the object and the visual observers also saw the object pass through the sky. The visual observers estimated the altitude of the object at 3000 feet.
