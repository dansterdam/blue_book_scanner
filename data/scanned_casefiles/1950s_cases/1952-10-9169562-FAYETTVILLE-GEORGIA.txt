Two remarkable falls of angel hair were reported in France on October 17 and 27, 1952, in both incidents, witnessed observed in the strangely shaped, cottony cloud at a heig[ht of] several thou- sand feet. Above it was a long, narrow, cylindrical object trailed by a white plume, moving slowly across the sky and accompanied by twenty or thirty smaller objects that looked like puffs of smoke.

Following a broken path, they made rapid zigzag motions, and left a broad ribbon of white substance that slowly drifted to the ground and clung to trees, telephone wires, and roofs of houses. These masses of white threads were described as like wool, nylon, or Fiberglas. When rolled into a ball they became gelatinous and disappeared within a few hours; set on fire, they burned like cellophane.

To French entomologists, the angel hair seen in October 1952, was no mystery at all. The objects dancing the strange ballet were not spaceships, but spiders. Far from performing mysterious experiment, they were merely carrying out the well-established routine of migration.

Each year the young spiders of most species leave the nests of their infancy and prepare to establish their own homes. Crawling by the hundreds or the thousands to the tops of fence posts, walls, or trees, they spin long silken webs, inflated by the air, carry the tiny emigrants up from the ground. These gossamer parachutes drift up and along on rising air currents, sometimes to great heights; they may soar for a few yards or for many miles over hills and valleys. These migrating balloonists have been observed as high as 14,000 feet, and at sea 200 miles from any land. Eventually drifting back to earth, the spiders detach the now useless parachutes and move off to build new nests for the coming year, while the abandoned gossamer may pile up in great masses on trees, fences, telephone wires, and ground, to decay and vanish in a matter of hours.

These gossamer showers sometimes include so many outward webs that the filmy blankets of fine silk may be several inches deep and may cover an entire landscape like snow.

These migrations occur in spring or, more frequently, in autumn—but only when the weather is exactly right. Spiders may sit patiently for days, waiting for a calm, clear, windless day. On such days the steady upward currents of air from the sun-warmed ground carry the spiders gently aloft [?]. The association of angel hair with UFO sightings is completely natural. The drifting patches of gossamer reflect the sun brilliantly. A whole armada of saucers can appear simultaneously overhead and then vanish as the gossamer cascades to earth.

The description of the material and the date of the fall both indicate that the angel hair observed in France in October 1952 was of arachnid origin. Even the weather was exactly right—superb, with a sky of cloudless blue—for the migration of a mother of spiders.

Second Officer G. R. Roberts of the American S. S. Adabelle likes reports that on October 17, 1952, at 1010 G. M. T., in lat. 28°20' N., lon. 90°82' W., a brilliant light-green meteor was observed bearing 385° at an approximate altitude of 30°. So intense was the initial flash that the meteor illuminated the entire northwest horizon and as it descended pieces were observed falling from it which "resembled burning gasoline being thrown from a barrel." This phenomenon, which was of 5 seconds' duration, disappeared bearing north at approximately 8° altitude.

Weather clear, wind N. force 2, visibility Yallahs, barometer 80.02 inches, temperature air 74° F., sea 79° F.

Third Officer Frank Kaminski, of the American S. S. Atlantic Seaman, Capt. Martin E. Dahl, Master, reports that while en route to Port Said at 1955 G. M. T., October 18, 1952, in lat. 35°67' N., lon. 15°48' E., he observed a comet-like streak which appeared in the north at an altitude of 35°, which moved in a westward and downward direction for about 2 or 3 seconds when at a bearing of 345° it exploded with a blinding flash which illuminated the entire area for about a second. A trail was visible in the path of the object to where it exploded, then curved upward and back to the eastward in a hook-shaped formation of rust-colored smoke.

This trail was visible for at least 10 minutes before it disappeared completely.

A similar observation was made by Mr. Kaminski on the night of November 16 in South Suez Bay, but was bright orange in color and cigar shaped. It was headed at an altitude of 15° and was visible about 5 seconds.

Chief Officer Gerald F. Burgess of the Canadian S. S. Rincon Hills, Capt. E. A. Mallock, Master, reports that at 0015 G. M. T., October 28, 1952, in lat. 12°30' N., lon. 64°58' W., he observed a meteor originating very close to the star Acrus altitude 24° bearing 170°. It was not traveling as fast as the usual meteor but was twice the size of Venus when setting and had a tail giving off a very brilliant greenish light. The direction of travel was 240°, and it was still visible when less than 5° above the horizon. When passing behind clouds it gave the effect of lightning, although there was no lightning at the time.

Weather partly cloudy, wind N.E. force 4, air temperature 84° F.

Questions asked in SKD TIG-4399-C. He stated that observations had never been made of any phenomena which could be mistaken for unconventional missiles or aircraft. He further stated that all observations made were routine or continuos studies of known or natural heavenly bodies, and that all objects sighted were explained by previous astronomical knowledge or natural laws of the universe.

2. COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer: This completes SKD TIG-4399-C and its cancellation is suggested.

1. Transmitted herewith, in accordance with AFL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, are the compiled reports of the Imperial Iranian Army relating to unidentified flying objects in Iran. Inclosures 1, 3, 4, and 5 are the Persian language documents, and Inclosure 2 is an Iranian Army translation to English of what was apparently a table for the compilation of the various reports.

2. For the most part, these reports are discounted by the Asst. Chief of Staff, G-2, Iranian Army; he feels that the observers are incompetent and their reports are generally unacceptable. In spite of this they all have common characteristics, which he can not explain. He does feel, however, that most of the objects could be explained as meteorological balloons, jet aircraft, or meteors, any of which would stimulate the undetected observer to build up a story about what he saw.

3. Insofar as possible, this office is complying with the directives of AFL 200-5. Paragraph seven directs separate reports for single incidents which is impractical in this particular case.

Translation of Incl No. 1

From G-2, 5th Branch to Chief of Staff, Army, subject: Extract from Reports Received Relative to Luminous Objects Sighted in Iran; Foreign Investigations and Opinions.

1. American Air Force Investigations of Flying Saucers. It has been three years that in the States of the U.S. flying objects of many different types (cigar - spherical objects like saucers) have been seen. These were single or in groups, moved very fast, with somewhat similar to that of a walking snake, and had no sound. They would suddenly turn in direction 50 or 150 degrees. Experts and offices allied to this subject have various opinions. A portion maintains that these things are not made by human hands, but were reflected light or mirages, but other groups do not access this theory.

2. Investigations of the English Government. The English government with many investigations has found that these things are not figments of the imagination, that they are some sort of air weapon and are manufactured in communist countries, perhaps in Russia. Because of this an office for the investigation of these flying saucers was created. The office has been occupied with a group of scientists, pilots, and photographers. This office has been under the Air Ministry, with a general officer as head. From the studies it became evident that these saucers move from sea to sea. Even the start, air and sea maneuvers of the western powers have sighted each day several flying.

3. In Iran. There have been 13 reports of luminous objects, all of which are connected to the boundary of Russia (ward parts of which are attached). (Translator's notes: Performing probably to a map which was attached to original report.) The other two are from Kazerun (29°38'N 51°52'E) and Lamerd (near the border of Baluchistan). The luminous objects are in various opinions spherical, rocket-like, or saucers, and all are luminous and move very fast. The sighting of some of these was not longer than a few seconds and three reports stated that they made a terrible noise.

G-2 Report: It is probable that in Iran these are explainable things which were not understood; in spite of that, the following points are made:

1. It is possible that these sightings have been atomic weapons first from Russian territory - such as 1, 4, 5, and 7. (Probably referring to Incl. 2.)

2. Probable astronomical bodies.

3. Probable optical illusions.

4. These things were various bodies.

5. Perhaps machines for photography or the completion of atmospheric studies.

The text on this page appears to be in a non-English language, possibly Arabic or another script that reads right-to-left. However, the text is very faint and partially illegible. I can see several lines of text, but cannot confidently transcribe the specific words due to the poor image quality and low contrast.

I apologize, but the text in this image is extremely difficult to read clearly. The document appears to be a typewritten page with dense text, but the image quality is very low contrast and blurry. While I can see there is text present, I cannot confidently OCR the specific words and sentences. The document seems to be an official report or document, with some handwritten markings visible at the top right corner, but the details are not legible to me.

I apologize, but the text on this page appears to be in a language or script that is not easily readable or recognizable. The document looks like a scanned page with text, but the characters are blurry and indistinct. I cannot confidently transcribe the text without risking significant errors. The page appears to be from a document related to Project Blue Book, as you mentioned, but the specific content is illegible in this image.

On the evening of October 31 at 7:30 PM
while traveling from Highway #85 toward
Atlanta some 8 miles from Fayetteville
a strange object was seen flying overhead

This strange object appeared to be
flying at three tops level as I approached
it. It was of orange color and
very similar to low air blimps. I
was traveling at a speed of 60-70
miles per hour as I approached
this object. It was coming directly
over the road some 200 yards
ahead so I immediately thought
of falling aircraft and tried to
stop. However, I went under the object
while was moving very slowly some
the road. As I passed under,
the radio in the car was silenced
by as if traveling over a bridge
or under pass. There was no
state - just silenced until object was passed.

As I quickly got out of the car,
the object seemed directly over head
at an estimated 500 feet. The
length was estimated 40 times the
height and width. (80' x 20' x 20')
A clear bottom view, side view, and
angle view was seen. After.

The text on this page is mostly illegible. There are some handwritten lines of text that appear to be in a language that is not English, possibly Arabic or another script. At the bottom right of the page, there is a handwritten note that says "Jack-05". The document appears to be an old, scanned black and white document with significant fading and low contrast.

Here is the text from the document:

lingering for about 20 seconds overhead the node seemed to point in a 45° clomb steadily increasing in speed and angle of climb until it disappeared slightly to the left of the moon and in an easterly direction. The speed was tremendous and completely disappeared in approximately 40 seconds.

There were no sparks nor was there any sound. The night was very clear and stars and moon very bright. There were no light beams visible and I looked all around.

This object was very dull, orange near the center line and was brighter near the outer border edge.

As the object passed between the view of moon, and my location, on the upward climb, the color seemed to blend in with that of the moon, but was still visible.
