24 July 1958

MEMORANDUM FOR: Captain Mistech - ACIN-Wf3a

SUBJECT: General Orbital-Track Checks for Air Sciences Division.

1. This office has received a number of UFO reports from COC posts in the Green Bay, Northern Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota areas. A currency check discloses that these are primarily staffed with high school students now on vacation and elderly people with time on their hands. Their reliability is obvious. However, would appreciate if a check for Satellite be made on the basis of the following observed in that area:

a. Time: Between 2120 to 2140 hours (local).
b. Date: 12 July 1958.
c. General direction: SSW to ENE.
d. UFO appearance: Very small, white and round.

2. Just received UFO report from Air Attache, France - there were four military observers. Basic data:

a. Place: AE France (50 N - 4 E).
b. Time: 2127 Z (GMT for that area considered G. Therefore, local time same).
c. Date: 11 July 1958.
d. General direction: 180 - 190 degrees to 1050 degrees, estimate, i.e. generally SE to NE.
e. Appearance: Round, white. In sight approximately one minute.

3. Your comments and results of your computations may be hand written directly on this memorandum. Would appreciate it if you would give me a call.

Comment re sighting No. 1:

Date: 12 July 1958
Hours: 2120 - 2140 local
Place: Area near Greenbay, Wisc.)

13/0:20 - 0240 July
88 W, 4500 (Covers area to the North
and west also)

a. 0240 Z on 12 July 1958
Over Lake Huron at 135 miles altitude.

(Sputnik III rocket) was

Using general observation point of 45 degrees N - 90 degrees West
the satellite (1958 △ ) of Sputnik III followed the rocket portion
by about 8 minutes at this particular time. It's orbit was about 115 miles
to the West of rocket site, but still pretty much in the visibility
range i.e. (visible at 45 degrees N and 75 degrees - 80 degrees W) upper
half of lower Michigan. Although the direction of motion is consistent
with that of sputnik III, no further component seems to have been sufficiently
low off the eastern horizon to be seen in the area described.

Comment re sighting No. 2:

Date: 11 July 1958
Time: 2127 Z
Place: NE France (50 N 4 E)

1958 AT (rocket) should have been in the vicinity of the sighting
area (50 degrees N, 4 degrees E) at 2117 Z on 11 July at an altitude of
165 miles traveling in a direction of 25 degrees.
