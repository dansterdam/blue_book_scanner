AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(UNCLASSIFIED) Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title) (UNCOVERED)
Middletown Air Materiel Area    DATE OF INFORMATION    Olmsted Air Force, Middletown, Pa.
13 August 1952    13 August 1952

Air Force Letter No. 200-5, 29 Apr 52

SUMMARY: (Enter brief summary of report. Give significance in first and second paragraphs. List incidents in brief.)

An unidentified flying object, a high school student, Millheim, Pa., reported observing an unidentified flying object at approximately 2130-2135, 12 August 1952, together with three other teen-age companions, while driving southeast of Millheim (4050 - 7830). The object was described as a yellow light, approximately 120 times the size of a star, which remained stationary. The object was described as remaining in a stationary position high above the ground horizon. The total observation lasted from 5 to 10 minutes. The observer reported that when he stopped his car to get a better look at the object, it slowly faded out. No of the companions verified his description corroborated Salona's.

Your observation was further verified by Mr. [redacted], an adult of South Penn Street, Millheim, Pa., who stated that while driving on a highway southwest of Millheim near Spring Mills, Pa. (4050 - 7735), at approximately 2130, he observed an object similar to that given above. [redacted] described the object as being approximately 10 - 230 above the horizon, a light approximately northeast in direction. He was driving the observation and did not stop his car. Therefore it is possible that the object only appeared to be moving and could give no accurate description of the object's speed or altitude. Mr. [redacted] flight captain of a local flying club, made a night observation and finally making a sharp turn to the South and disappearing.

The weather during the observation was clear with 16-mile visibility.

While there has been heavy meteor activity in this area for the past few days, the object described in this Report cannot be considered as an astronomical phenomena.

There are several navigation lights located in the Millheim area; however, a reflection from such lights would be improbable on a clear night.

The possibility that the object was in reality an aircraft cannot be dispelled; however, the length of the observation (10 to 20 min) seems to invalidate this possibility.

The possible presence of a weather balloon in the area has not been established, however, the intensity and size of the light would not appear to be that of a balloon.
