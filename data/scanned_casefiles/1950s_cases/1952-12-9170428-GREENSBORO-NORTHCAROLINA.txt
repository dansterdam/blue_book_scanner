Transcription of the text in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED
Hurstville, South Carolina 15 December 1952

I. Description of Incident:
At 0915 EST an RF-80 over this location visually sighted a circular silver object about the size of a half-dollar. Object was seen for a period of 15 seconds and approached from the east, changing direction and altitude erratically, and was lost from sight at a relative bearing of 330° at approximately 30,000 ft. The weather was clear.

II. Discussion of Incident:
Since this sighting occurred 10 minutes before a similar one at Greensboro, North Carolina, the possibility of this being a hoax should be explored. The following conclusions have been drawn: The objects could not have been a normal weather balloon, because the prevailing winds dictated that any free-floating object would have been carrying it from Hurstville, South Carolina, to Greensboro, North Carolina, and not in the opposite direction. Secondly, the objects could not have been a single jet aircraft traveling from Hurstville north to Greensboro, thereby necessitating a ground speed of 690 mph, with a general wind from the north at 75 knots and the sightings were 10 minutes apart thereby indicating the sightings were 10 minutes apart. Neither could they have been jet aircraft, as fighter pilots indicate that the objects probably were not jets. Although there was much belief that these objects were in both sightings, a thorough examination has been eliminated as a possibility for the above reason.
Both sightings occurred within an hour of a scheduled rawinsonde weather balloon ascension at Greensboro, and an unscheduled rawinsonde release at Hurstville incidentally, very characteristic of the type of balloon observations received by ATIC, the conclusion reached is that the object seen at Hurstville was possibly a balloon.

III. Conclusion:
Possibly a balloon.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Major Gray's report on 12 December 1952 while flying straight and level at 30,000 ft. as number two man in a two ship formation (C-45) sighted an unidentified object at 11 o'clock position about 5 miles away. The object appeared to be a silver, disc-shaped object and was observed for approximately 1.5 to 2 minutes. It appeared to be closing on the aircraft and suddenly made a sharp climbing turn and disappeared from sight. The sighting was reported to be similar to a previous formation on 10 December 1952 when a similar object was observed.
It was determined that the object was not a meteorological phenomenon and it did not observe it. The sighting was witnessed by the two pilots and it was brought to the attention of the flight leader, but he did not observe it. It was about that time that winds aloft at this time were reported at 3500 at 75 knots.

STATEMENT CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

On 15 December 1952 while flying straight and level at 15,000 feet, as number two man in a two ship formation (2 RF-80's), I observed an unidentified object at 11 o'clock high position. The time was approximately 0915 and we were heading west over Greensboro, N.C. at the time of sighting. I first noted the object by its silver color, reflections from it, and its oscillating movements. I was flying close formation at the time, approximately 300 MPH, the right wing of the lead aircraft and observed a reflection approximately 6" to 12" above the leader's canopy. At first I thought that it was another aircraft doing "Lazy Eights" at 30,000 feet*or higher; however from past observations of aircraft doing this maneuver at high altitudes, I decided that it was rising and falling too fast to be another aircraft. I called it to the attention of the flight leader, but he did not observe it. About that time we went into a bank and I lost sight of the object and did not observe it again.

Shortly thereafter another two ship element reported an unidentified object. Recognizing their call sign as two pilots in my squadron, I requested that they try to get a good observation since I too had noted it. Since it was some distance away, I could not determine too much about it. However, from my position it appeared about the size of a 50 cent piece and I felt that it was at least 10 miles away. As a rough estimation, it appeared to be looming and gaining about 3,000 feet at a rate of about 5,000 feet per minute. It appeared circular in shape, but distance precluded an accurate description.

STATEMENT CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

I was in a flight of two RF-80's flying north at approximately 300 MPH at 25,000*. I spotted an object over Greensboro, N. C. at about 6:10 p.m. It was a bright silvery object (approximately 35,000') and it made an arc around to our 6 o'clock position. I called it to the leader's attention and he also spotted the object. Time was 0925. 

It was observed for approximately 45 seconds. Speed and size unknown. The object was bright silver in color and appeared to be spherical in shape with two projections on top.

I was undetermined whether the object was moving or hovering after it went to 6 o'clock position. We did not try to intercept the object.

Greensboro, North Carolina
15 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
An AF-20 in flight over Greensboro sighted a silvery, round, spherical object with a clock-like luminous glow around the fuselage. The object was observed by the pilot on 15 December 1952 at approximately 7:35 p.m. The pilot was on a north heading at 25,000 feet traveling at 300 mph.

II. Discussion of Incident
The airforce show that AFB were in the area at the time of sighting as was a balloon released from the weather station at Greensboro. The pilot probably could have recognized the aircraft but a silvery, round, weather balloon might not be so easily recognized due to its small size. It appears that the latter explains the cause for this sighting. 

III. Conclusion
Probably a balloon.

This eliminates the possibility that such objects were the same balloons. The objects could not have been a single spot of light because it covered an area 175 miles in 10 minutes or so.

Transcription of the document text:

Synopsis of Two sightings:

1) 09/15 EST - Hartsville, S.C.
2) 09/21 EST - Greenboro, N.C.

40 - 45 minutes sighted
115 Miles between Greenboro & Hartsville. 
Traveled 95 m.p.h. from 260°.

3-3 minutes
4-9 m.p.h.
5-23 m.p.h. detached lights
8.73 m.p.h. constant speed

Object sighted at Greenboro would have traveled 34.5 miles in 15 minutes. The object seen at Hartsville is located 115 miles away from Greenboro.

These sightings further eliminate the possibility of a local object, and the object seen in the two towns appears to be one and the same.
