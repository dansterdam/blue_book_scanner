UNCLASSIFIED

Hurstville, South Carolina                                                15 December 1952

I.   Description of Incident

At 0915 EST an RF-80 over this location visually sighted a circular silver object about the size of a half-dollar. Object was seen for a period of 10 to 15 seconds and apparently was oscillating, losing and gaining altitude alternately. The pilot was on a 270° heading at 15,000 Ft. and saw the unknown at a relative bearing of 330° at approximately 30,000 ft. The weather was clear with CATU conditions.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Since this sighting occurred 10 minutes before a similar one at Greensboro, North Carolina, the possibility of the two pilots actually seeing the same object has been looked into. The following conclusions have been drawn: The objects could not have been a single weather balloon launched at Hurstville, South Carolina, because the prevailing winds for the general area were from 360° at 75 knots, or blowing directly against a free floating object and carrying it south. Or the original observation point, nor north Greensboro, could not have been a single jet aircraft traveling from Hurstville north to Greensboro. The distance is 115 miles between sightings and the sightings were 10 minutes apart.

Thereby necessitating a ground speed of 690 mph. With a general wind from the north blowing at 75 knots at 25,000 ft. it seems unlikely that a jet could hit this speed. Furthermore the description of the unknown as "round and silver" from experienced fighter pilots indicates that the objects probably were not jets. Although there was much local air traffic in both sightings, aircraft has been eliminated as a possibility for the above reason.

Both sightings occurred within an hour of a scheduled rawinsonde weather balloon release at Greensboro, North Carolina, and an unscheduled release around the Hurstville area. Taking the descriptions of both objects, which are, incidentally, very characteristic, as of a balloon observations received by ATIC, the conclusion reached is that the object seen at Hurstville was possibly a balloon. At Greensboro probably a balloon.

III. Conclusion

Possibly a balloon.

368d Tactical Reconnaissance Gp

Major Gray:
    On 15 December 1952 while flying straight and level at 15,000 ft, as number two
man in a two ship formation (2RF-305), I observed an unidentified object at 11 o'clock
high position. The time was approximately 0915 and we were heading west over Hartsville, S.C. at the time of sighting. I first noted the object by its silver color,
reflections from it, and its oscillating movements. I was flying close formation
at the time, approximately 300 mph, off the right wing of the lead aircraft and
observed a reflection approximately 6° to 12° above the leader canopy. At first I
thought this was an engine airstart doing "way slant" at 30,000 ft. However,
from past observations of aircraft doing this maneuver at high altitudes,
I decided that it was rising and falling too fast to be another aircraft. I called
it to the attention of the flight leader, but he did not observe it. About that
time we went into a bank, and I lost sight of the object and did not observe it again.

    Since it was some distance away, could not determine too much about it. However, from my position it appeared about the size of a 50 cent piece and I felt that
it was at least 10 miles away. As a rough estimation, it appeared to be loosing
and gaining about 3,000 ft. at a rate of about 5,000 ft. per minute. It appeared
circular in shape, but distance precluded an accurate description.

    Shortly thereafter another two ship element reported an unidentified object,
Reconnaissance, their call sign as two pilots in my squadron, I requested that they
try to get a good observation since I too had noted it.

1/Lt. Williams:
    I was in a flight of two RF-80's flying north at approximately 300 mph at
25,000 ft. I spotted, an object over Greensboro, North Carolina, 11 miles first
seen at 11 o'clock high (approximately 35,000 ft.) and it made an arc around to our
6 o'clock position. I called it to the lead's attention and also spotted the
object.    Time was 0925. It was observed for approximately 45 seconds.    Speed and
size unknown. The object was bright silver in color and appeared to be spherical
in shape with two projections on top.

STATEMENT CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

On 15 December 1952 while flying straight and level at 15,000 feet, as number two man in a two ship formation (2 RF-80's), I observed an unidentified object at 11 o'clock high position. The time was approximately 0915 and we were heading west over Hartsville, S. C. at the time of sighting. I first noted the object by it's silver color, reflections from it, and its oscillating movements. I was flying close formation at the time, approximately 300 MPH, the right wing of the lead aircraft and observed a reflection approximately 6" to 12" above the leader's canopy. At first I thought that it was another aircraft doing "lazy Eights" at 30,000 feet or higher; however from past observations of aircraft doing this maneuver at high altitudes, I decided that it was rising and falling too fast to be another aircraft. I called it to the attention of the flight leader, but he did not observe it. About that time we went into a bank and I lost sight of the object and did not observe it again.

Shortly thereafter another two ship element reported an unidentified object. Recognizing their call sign as two pilots in my squadron, I requested that they try to get a good observation since I too had noted it.

Since it was some distance away, I could not determine too much about it. However, from my position it appeared about the size of a 50 cent piece and I felt that it was at least 10 miles away. As a rough estimation, it appeared to be losing and gaining about 3,000 feet at a rate of about 5,000 feet per minute. It appeared circular in shape, but distance precluded an accurate description.

STATEMENT CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

I was in a flight of two RF-80's flying north at approximately 300 MPH at 25,000'. I spotted an object over Greensboro, N. C.

It was first seen at 11 o'clock high (approximately 35,000') and it made an arc around to our 6 o'clock position. I called it to the leader's attention and he also spotted the object. Time was 0925.

It was observed for approximately 45 seconds. Speed and size unknown. The object was bright silver in color and appeared to be spherical in shape with two projections on top.

I was undetermined whether the object was moving or hovering after it went to 6 o'clock position. We did not try to intercept the object.

Greensboro, North Carolina                                                   15 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
An RF-80 in flight over Greensboro sighted a spherical object with a bright silver color at about 0925 EST on 15 December 1952. It moved from a 12 o'clock high position to a 6 o'clock high when the pilot lost contact with the unknown. Pilot was on a north heading at 25,000 feet traveling at 300 mph.

II. Discussion of Incident
Two aircraft from Shaw AFB were in the area at the time of sighting as was a balloon release from the weather station at Greensboro. The pilot probably could have recognised the aircraft but a silver, round, weather balloon might not be so easily recognised due to its small size. It appears that the latter explains the cause for this sighting.

III. Conclusion
Probably a balloon.

Here is the text from the document:

This eliminated the possibility that low-flying objects originally was the camera balloon. The objects could not have been a single jet plane seen flying white because it curved.

115 miles in 10 minutes or:

10% or 20m
115        X = 690
10x = 6700

a speed of 690 m.p.h. This is too fast for a jet burning rotary horizontally from the south.

Conclusion: unbelievable

Analysis of Two Sightings:

1) 0915 EST - Hartsville, S.C.
2) 0925 EST - Greensboro, N.C.

115 miles between Greensboro & Hartsville. Straight line.
10 knots 75 knots per hour from 360°

Ft = 433
Vx = 93 m.p.h.

Sighted would have 2.1/2 miles in 30 min.

Sighted would have 2.5 miles in 15 min.

1.5 miles in 3 min.

Object sighted at Greensboro would have traveled 34.5 miles in 10 minutes. The object seen at Hartsville is located 115 miles away from Greensboro.

Most important factor eliminating the possibility of both objects sighted being one in the same: Object was seen first at Hartsville at 0915 and would have been able to be seen at Greensboro.
