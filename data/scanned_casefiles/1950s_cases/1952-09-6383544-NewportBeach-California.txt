10. CONCLUSION
BIRDS

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
1 luminescent object pale gold. One sighting at 2135, one at 4:07 AM. Sound like soft breeze. Second object was quite low, 1st far away. Objects came directly overhead. 11-15 objects in formation at 1st sighting. Flight North to South. Flight in straight line.

Witness 62 year old lady. Reported the objects to COC. Letter to ISAF in 1965. No Investigation. Sighting too old. Observation is characteristic of a flight of birds at night reflecting light from the ground. Duration, formation sound areas of sky through which the objects passed all consistent with this analysis. Also directions to South tends to add to theory of migratory birds such as ducks or geese being in formation.

The page contains three diagrams:

- Bottom left diagram: A landscape scene with a road or path and a silhouetted figure
- Bottom right diagram: A smaller landscape scene with a similar perspective

The page number 230 and the title "FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER SPACE" are clearly visible at the top of the page.

which I put it down -the
day after I saw the "U.F.O's"
then I put the back aside
and forgot to send in
my notes- today something
ill me to that back and
there were my notes. So
this time I am sending
them in as others saw
their objects in this area
at the same time and they
may have reported their
sightings in Laguna Beach
and Long Beach, Calif. Even
my notes may be helpful.
At the time I saw these
objects I was an observer
of "G.O.C." for U.S.A.T.
I am the former wife
of Colonel H. Louis, Mississippi

Gentlemen: I am not
sure that your office
is the proper place to
send my report but that
address is all I have. I
got appendix "I" from the
back of a book written
by Harold E. Keyhoe in 1953,
also got your address
from Appendix #1, same book.
When I finished reading this
book "Flying Saucers" from
outer space, I filled in the
sheets in the back of
the book from my notes

Mrs Bmt/man/SAFOIR/728%2/2 Sep 65

Dear Bmt/Advisor:                                                 SEP-7 1965

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which
you could not identify.

Due to the time lapse involved, it is not possible for us
to investigate your report. We received no other reports from the
California area for 23 September 1952.

The books by Donald Keyhoe are considered to be science
fiction by the Air Force.

I am enclosing the report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force
UFO project. I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING

UFO Sighting, 23 Sep 52, California

25 AUG 1965

Hq USAF LAWDOC (New Haven)
Wash D C 20330

This office is in receipt of a letter from the reporting an unidentified flying object which on 23 Sep 52. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mr.

Your observation of an unidentified object in 1952 is too old to warrant an investigation by the Air Force. There were no reports from the California area 23 Sep 52.

Since you reported this object to the Filter Center at Santa Monica, California, we can assure you an evaluation was legally at that time made by the Air Force. No known or conventional object was sighted flying by the Air Force.

The attached brochure explains the unidentified flying object program to date. The Air Force appreciates your interest in this.
