Salem, Oregon... March 5, 1958... Mrs. Elton Piper, 4347 MacLeay Rd.
reports seeing a very blue streak trailed by a flashing red area about the
size of a red large iron traveling East at approx speed of 1165 MPH...
Must have been a jet plane because UFO's do not exist says the USAF.

The rest of the document appears to be a grid or chart with intersecting lines and some small markings/notations, but the text is too faint or blurry to definitively transcribe. The image looks like a technical diagram or map with a crosshatched grid pattern.


- page 4 -

The image appears to be a technical diagram or chart with a grid of intersecting lines and numerous small dots. The lines create a complex geometric pattern across the page. Some text is partially visible at the edges of the document, but it is too illegible to read with certainty. The bottom left corner contains the letters "FCC" and the image has some edge distortion and fading typical of an older scanned document.


- page 5 -

This image appears to be a detailed map or chart, specifically a projection map with latitude and longitude lines. The map covers a large geographical area, likely showing North America and surrounding regions. The map is filled with numerous grid lines, numbers, and small text annotations. Due to the image quality and density of information, many of the specific text details are difficult to read clearly. The map has a curved, distorted projection typical of certain cartographic representations, with more detailed gridding and annotations in some areas compared to others.

This image appears to be a map or chart with latitude and longitude lines. There are various numerical annotations across the map, which seems to show parts of North America, the Pacific Ocean, and possibly parts of Asia. The map is in black and white, with a dark vertical band on the left side of the image. The map includes geographical outlines and curved lines representing what might be weather patterns or other geographical data. However, the specific text and numbers are too small and blurry to be precisely transcribed.

SAUCERS OVER PORTUGAL
by Sr. Mariano Alves

LISBON - In the Spring of 1958 four jet pilots of the Portuguese Air Force were on a problem between Gramar and Lisbon (near Lisbon) swarming and called to each other on their communications gear. The four brightly glowing saucers were from a cigar-shaped "mother" ship. They observed the four saucers close alongside and then the problem watching the mother ship and the saucers for some 25 minutes. They told of their sighting and Sr. Mariano Alves of Lisbon personally interviewed them.

The story was carried in the papers for a couple of days and then their senior officer told them that it might be better if they did not talk too much about it. When asked "Why" Sr. Alves became interested in the UFO phenomena because of the strange story recently revealed to him by a young friend of his from the South of Portugal, who is an engineering student.

Sr. Alves reports to the SPACE-CRAFT DIGEST: "As he knows the confidential nature of the observation, he will tell it to you as if I myself have lived it.

Because the statement of my friend F. is that which seems to me the most interesting, I will transcribe it here."

(The rest of the text continues but is partially cut off at the bottom of the page)

There is also a black and white photograph of a person (Pilot 14) on the left side of the document.

Watch Tonight
For Sputnik II

Contrary to an earlier report, Sputnik II may be visible tonight to Daytonian, Kenneth E. Kissell of Fairborn said yesterday.

It should be seen at 7:38 p.m. at 16 degrees above the western horizon moving northward, he said. The satellite should reach its highest point in the sky a little west of due north and disappear over the northern horizon. "It'll be about as bright as the brightest star."

Sputnik II may also be visible at 7:08 p.m. tomorrow at 28 degrees above the western horizon as it moves northeast and in a similar path.

Kissell is chairman of the local "moonwatcher" team here which has a station at Civil Defense headquarters at Stillwater sanitarium, 8100 N. Main st.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR FEBRUARY 22, 1958

LANGUAGE
Longer Words Found
Easier to Understand

> LONGER WORDS to identify letters of the alphabet are more easily understood than shorter ones, two scientists report in Science (Feb. 7).
They suggest the familiar Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, and so on alphabet letters placed with longer words to increase their intelligibility. A person named Sedgwick, for instance, might explain the spelling of his name this way: "S as in student, E as in examination, D as in department, G as in industry, W as in welcome." (as in companion, K as in kingdom.)

METEOROLOGY
See Advance
Storm Warning

> DETECTING the formation of hurricanes and predicting the paths of these great tropical storms for several days in advance are foreseen in a report issued by the Smithsonian Institution.
R. C. Gentry and R. H. Simpson of the Weather Bureau's National Hurricane Research Project, West Palm Beach, Fla., reported meteorologists are now making "considerable progress" in understanding the basic mechanisms of hurricanes. They believe some day it may even be possible to put "power brakes" or steering wheels on the great storms.

Doing this, however, means obtaining control of as yet unknown forces in hurricanes themselves. The natural force of the great storms is so much stronger than anything man can ever hope to bring against it that control by any external means probably will always be impossible.
Radar and storm-plunging reconnaissance planes are two fruitful sources of hurricane information.

The discovery of spiral rainbands is among the recent findings concerning the tropical storms. Most of the heavy rain in hurricanes, the second greatest factor in loss of life and property damage, occurs in rainbands that spiral inward toward the storm's center. Between the two bands, rainfall is relatively light and near the outer edges of these centers.

Most hurricanes, it is now known, have several centers that may or may not be the same.

There is the center of wind circulation, the point of lowest air pressure and the point around which the spiral rainbands rotate. Locations of these centers may differ by as much as 20 miles.

Hurricanes frequently move along or at right paths that wander back and forth across the relatively straight path the storm was expected to follow. Some of these oscillations have a short period of 12 to 36 hours.

ASTRONOMY
Martian Atmosphere Has
Very Little Water Vapor

> ALL THE WATER vapor on Mars equals that found in a box of earthly air two feet long and ten feet high.

If this vapor were condensed to liquid water, it would form a film one-tenth as thick over the entire surface of the planet.

This is the final conclusion of the most delicate examination yet made of the Martian atmosphere. Findings were done by the National Bureau of Standards scientists, Dr. G. C. Kies and Mrs. Harriet K. Kies, and C. H. Corlis and Mrs. Edith L. P. Corlis.

They found the upper limit of water vapor surrounding Mars by examining photographs of sunlight reflected from the planet when the light was spread out into its rainbow colors or spectra. Their observations were made from both the Washington, D.C., and Georgeown College Observatories.

The Martian spectra were compared with those of the moon's sky as a check. This was done because the moon is known to be essentially without an atmosphere and because the same sunlight is reflected from it.

In decerning Martian water vapor, the photographs distinguished it from the atmosphere, the spectra photographs were taken when the planet was near and moving away from it during 1956.

ENGINEERING
Army Using Invisible
Light to Carry Messages

> INVISIBLE rays of infrared light are being used to transmit voice messages over considerable distances by Army Signal Corps engineers at the Electronic Proving Ground, Fort Huachuca, Ariz.

The "invisible light" waves can be made into a very narrow beam which can only be intercepted or tapped by a perfectly secret communication system. Once perfected, the new radio or wire messages are fed electrically into the infrared, since an enemy would not even be aware the light beam existed without special equipment.

Radio or wire messages are fed electrically into the infrared transmitter, and the output at the receiving end can be put on a telephone line, radio transmitter or public address system as desired.

The range of the communication system can be extended by putting relay stations on hilltops to take advantage of the line-of-sight characteristics of the wave, similar to television signals.

The communication systems now commonly used by the Army, such as radio and wire, have certain drawbacks that the new system may be able to overcome.

In time of conflict, radio traffic is so congested that it may become inadequate, while wire is time-consuming and the wire is vulnerable to cutting.

PHYSIOLOGY
New Technique Studies
Heart Muscle "in Action"

> A TECHNIQUE of analyzing the heart muscle "in action" may provide science with a better understanding of the intricate mechanism of the heartbeat.

Designed by Dr. William J. Whalen of the University of California at Los Angeles Medical School, the method makes possible simultaneous physical and biochemical measurements of heart muscle action.

Tiny strips of human and animal heart muscle are suspended in a small chamber which is attached a physiological vibration, and rate of contraction.

Various types of drugs can be put into the chamber to test their effects on heart tissue.

Though the use of this technique is still experimental, Dr. Whalen believes the heartbeat may be eventually established and perhaps, some chemical changes associated with heart failure, Dr. Whalen says.

The work is described in Circulation Research, and is being supported by the Los Angeles County and American Heart Associations.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for February 22, 1958

ASTRONOMY

Jupiter Makes Appearance

March, the month that sees the official end of winter with the coming of the vernal equinox on the 20th, is also a good time for observing the planets.

By JAMES STOKLEY

WITH THE COMING of March the planet Jupiter enters the evening sky early enough to appear on the accompanying maps. These show how the sky looks about 10:00 p.m., your own kind of standard time, on March 1, an hour earlier at the middle of the month and two hours earlier at the end.

Jupiter is low in the east, in the constellation of Virgo, the virgin, to the left of the star Spica. The planet is so bright, minus 1.9 on the astronomical scale, that even with the dimming of its light by reason of its low altitude it is a conspicuous object.

But Jupiter is not the only planet to be seen on March evenings. About the 20th, between Mercury will put in a brief appearance. For several evenings around this time you may see it low in the west as the sky darkens, until about two hours after sunset, when it, too, will descend below the horizon. It is not as bright as Jupiter, but is more brilliant than any other star, so it will be easy to locate if you have a clear view. It is not shown on our maps, since its position is drawn.

Brightest star of the March evenings is Arcturus, the jigger, in Cains Major, the great dog, which stands in the southwest. To the right is Orion, with two first-magnitude stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, and the three stars between them that mark the belt of this warrior. That was the way the stars were depicted on the old star maps. The figures of the figures were drawn around.

To the right, and a little higher, you can see the bull, with bright Aldebaran to its left. And moving upward, you come to Gemini, the twins, with Castor and Pollux, the first a star of the first magnitude. To the south of Pollux is Procyon, the brightest star in the figure of Canis Minor, the lesser dog.

Following the Zodiac Path

To the left of the Gemini is Cancer, the crab, a rather inconspicuous constellation which it is one of the 13 marking the path through which the sun, and planets move on to move. But to the left of Cancer is Leo, the lion, quite a distinct constellation with the bright star Regulus leading the lion's head, forms the "sickle," or question mark.

Continuing along the zodiac path, below Virgo, in which Jupiter now stands, comes Libra.

The sun reaches this halfway point on March 20, at 10:56 p.m. EST. This is called the "vernal equinox." "Vernal" because in this part of the world it marks the beginning of spring, while "equinox" refers to the day and night which are now almost equal, with the sun rising directly east, setting directly west, and above the horizon for exactly half of the 24-hour day.

Equal Days and Nights

Actually, however, this is not the case, and the equality of day and night, or the periods during which the sun is above and below the horizon, comes a few days earlier. There is an effect refraction, whereby the earth's atmosphere acts as a prism and bends toward the earth rays of light entering from outside. This has the effect of making any celestial object (unless it is exactly overhead) appear a little higher than it would if there were no atmosphere. Refraction is greatest at the horizon, where it raises an object a little more than the apparent diameter of the sun and moon. As a result we can see the sun before it has actually risen, and continue to see it after it has really set.

The fact that we call this the vernal equinox is evidence of our Northern Hemisphere background. As the sun moves northward, it is daily climbing higher into our skies. Its being higher is increasing and summer is on its way. But to the people in southern countries, this northward journey may mean that the sun is gradually getting higher.

will be visible low to the west in the evening twilight and this will be the best opportunity this year to see it.

Mercury's Revolution
Mercury is the innermost planet of the
solar system; it is so close to the sun, compared to the earth's distance of
93,000,000 miles. The diameter of Mercury
is 1000 miles, that of the earth is 7,915
miles, and it revolves around the sun in 88 days.

While it makes one such revolution
marking a "year", the earth also has been moving, so Mercury catches up to us
every 118 days, when it comes nearly between earth and sun, in the position called
"interior conjunction". Then, of course, it
cannot be seen, but about 22 days before
this and 22 days afterward, it is seen
farther away from the sun, either to the
east or west. This is called an elongation,
and it is the eastern elongation that comes
on the 29th. Then it follows after the sun
in its daily movement across the sky, and
sets well after sunset. Only at such a time
can Mercury be seen in the evening sky.

The reason that an elongation to the east
in the spring is more favorable than one in
the autumn is found in the way the planet
stands with respect to the sun.

On Nov. 20 it will be just as far away
from the sun as it will be on March 20, but
then it will be to the left of the sun and not
as much above it. This month it will be
well above the sun, and the same amount of
elongation will make for the greater delay
in setting after the sun has gone down.

So look for Mercury at the end of March.
You will not have as good a chance to see
it for another year.

ARCH.                                                1958    PONTA PORAN, BRAZIL
                                                    (LORENZEN P. 141)    34 WITNESSES

MR.    MARIO GONCALVES (SEE RELATED REPORT FOR FEBRUARY 19, 1958). HIS GIRL    0
FRIEND, HIS YOUNGER BROTHER AND OTHER FRIENDS DROVE OUT ON THE PONTA PORAN    0
ROAD. BETWEEN TWO SMALL WOODED AREAS GONCALVES STOPPED HIS JEEP AND THE BOYS    0
SAW. LOOKING FOR A *FLYING SAUCER* WITH THEIR FLASHLIGHTS. IT WAS ABOUT 10,300    0
*M.    GONCALVES AND HIS GIRL FRIEND IN THE CAR SUDDENLY SAW A BRIGHT OBJECT    0
HANGING OVER THE THICKET AHEAD OF THEM.    THE BOYS HAD SPOTTED THE THING, TOO.    0
THEN EVERYTHING LIGHTED UP AS BRIGHT AS IF IT HAD BEEN DAYTIME. WITH    0
UNEXPECTED SUDDENNESS, THE OBJECT STARTED TOWARD THE RUNNING YOUNGSTERS.    0
THE BOYS WERE QUICK, HOWEVER, AND THEY REACHED THE CAR AHEAD OF THE OBJECT.    0
THEN EVERYTHING LIGHTED UP AS BRIGHT AS IF IT HAD BEEN DAYTIME, BUT THE    0
LIGHT WAS BLOOD-RED.    GONCALVES SAID HIS HAIR STOOD UP ON THE BACK OF HIS    0
HEAD. THEY WERE DIRECTLY UNDER THE THING -- IT WAS LARGER THAN THEIR CAR AND    0
SEEMED TO BE MADE OF POLISHED METAL.    IT APPEARED TO BE SO NEAR THEY COULD    0
HAVE STRUCK IT WITH A SHORT POLE.    GONCALVES, FEARING THE OBJECT MIGHT COME    0
DOWN ON TOP OF THE CAR, STARTED THE JEEP AND HEADED BACK TOWARD TOWN.    0
    BUT THE UFO WAS -- THROUGH PLAYING.    IT FOLLOWED THEM, FLYING JUST BEHIND    0
THE JEEP AND ABOUT NINE FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.    THE JEEP AND THE SURROUNDING    0
AREA WERE ILLUMINATED BY THE BRIGHT GLOW EMITTED BY THE OBJECT. NO NOISE.    0
NEAR CAVE FROM 17. GONCALVES DROVE AT BREAKNECK SPEED OVER THE NARROW,    0
BUSH ROAD. THE CHASE LASTED ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES, UNTIL THE JEEP REACHED    0
ANOTHER THICKET WHERE THE ROAD PASSED THROUGH THE WOODS. GONCALVES HOPED THE    2
OBJECT COULDN'T FLY UNDER THE SMALL TREES.    HE WAS RIGHT, FOR THEY WATCHED THE    2
OBJECT PASS BEHIND THE TREES AND DISAPPEAR.    THINKING THE OBJECT HAD LEFT,    2
THEY RELAXED.    BUT WHEN THEY LEFT THE PROTECTION OF THE WOODS THEY SPOTTED IT    2
AGAIN OVER THEM THICKET, HIGHER IN THE SKY NOW, AS THOUGH THE OBJECT WERE    2
WAITING FOR THEM TO REAPPEAR.    THE ROAD CURVED TOWARD A HILL AHEAD.    2
ROSE AWAY, THE OBJECT DIVED AT HIGH SPEED, NOT TOWARD THE JEEP BUT STRAIGHT    2
TOWARD THE TOP OF THE HILL. WELL AHEAD OF THE VEHICLE, THEN IT DESCENDED OVER    2
THE HILL, STOPPING ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.    IT BLOCKED THEIR    2
WAY. THE JEEP HAD STARTED TO CLIMB THE HILL.    GONCALVES WAS PANIC-STRICKEN.    3
    HIS DAUGHTER CUT OFF ESCAPE TOWARD TOWN. HE COULD NOT GO BACK. HE MADE HIS    3
CHOICE -- HE KEPT GOING.    THE JEEP PICKED UP SPEED AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE    3
PREPARED FOR THE INEVITABLE CRASH.    3
    THEN A STRANGE THING HAPPENED. AS THE CAR CLIMBED THE HILL, ITS HEADLIGHTS    3
GRADUALLY RAISED UNTIL THE BEAMS OF LIGHT HIT THE UFO DIRECTLY.    NO    3
MOVEMENT OF EVERYONE IN THE JEEP, THE OBJECT BEGAN TO WOBBLE VIOLENTLY, THEN    3
STRAIGHTEN UP INTO THE AIR AS THOUGH IT WAS RUNNING AWAY.    GONCALVES KEPT    3
ACCELERATOR PRESSED DOWN.    THEY PASSED JUST A POINT NEAR THE UFO HAD SAT,    3
THEN THEY KEPT GOING.    THEY PASSED JUST UNDER THE OBJECT, BUT IT DID NOT    3
TOUCH THEM.    MINUTES LATER THE OBJECT BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE JEEP AGAIN, IT    3
SAT AT A DISTANCE.    AFTER TEN MINUTES OF THIS, IT CHANGED COURSE AND CLIMBED    4
VERTICALLY. ITS LIGHT WENT OUT AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FEET AND IT VANISHED    4
TO DARKNESS.    4
