SUBJECT: VISUAL OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. On 6 March 1958, at 1945 hours, local time, a visual observation of an unidentified flying object was made by two Airman stationed at Walnut Ridge Air Force Base, Arkansas.
2. The two Airmen were conducting a routine patrol when they observed a bright light in the southern sky. The light appeared to be moving in an erratic manner, sometimes hovering, sometimes darting rapidly in various directions.
3. The object was observed for approximately 20-25 minutes before it disappeared from view. During this time, the object was observed to change color from white to red to green. The size of the object appeared to vary during the observation, but was estimated to be approximately the size of a full moon.
4. At no time was the object observed to leave a trail or exhaust. The object appeared to move in a silent manner.
5. The two Airmen immediately reported the sighting to the Base Operations Office. The report was then forwarded to the Commanding Officer, Detachment 2, 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron, Malden Air Force Base, Missouri, for further investigation.
6. This report is submitted for your information and any further action deemed appropriate.

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

OUR REFERENCE WAS A LONG OBLONG Object which appeared to be about 35-40 feet long and about 10 feet thick at the center tapering to about 5 feet on the ends. It was silvery in color and seemed to be spinning or rotating on its longitudinal axis. When first sighted it was at approximately 15,000 feet altitude and moving in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of 300-500 knots. As it passed overhead, the rotation was visible as the reflected sunlight played on its surface. As it receded in the distance, it seemed to gain altitude and speed and was lost to sight.

Near it, at about 10,000 feet, was a smaller object which appeared to be a light gray or white in color and rectangular or elliptical in shape. It was motionless and remained in the same position relative to the larger object during the sighting.

What was very strange about this was that it was perfectly silent--no sound was audible at any time. Also it was a clear, cold day and visibility was excellent, so these objects could not have been any kind of natural phenomena like meteorological balloons or the like.

These two objects were sighted by several highly reliable and thoroughly competent observers, all of whom gave practically identical descriptions. Their sightings lasted about 2 to 3 minutes before the objects disappeared. Every effort was made to get additional information, but it was impossible to do so.

SAUCERS OVER PORTUGAL
by M. Mencarini Alfani

LISBON - In the spring of 1958 four jet pilots at the portuguese Air Force base near the capital city of Lisbon saw a strange phenomenon - four glowing saucers hovering and darting in the sky. The pilots were from the 4th Fighter Squadron and they were able to scrutinize the objects through their cockpits for some 30 to 45 minutes. They did in fact, declare that the saucers were performing in a rather amazing way. Not only did they hover, but they darted off in different directions with tremendous speed. The pilots estimated the objects were moving at speeds greater than 3,000 mph. The saucers also gave off a bright glow and were whitish in color. After some time, they simply accelerated out of sight.

Apparently a number of other witnesses from the ground also saw the objects, including civilians living nearby the air base. These witnesses confirmed the observations of the pilots and testified that the saucers were maneuvering in a most unusual way. Their speeds and abrupt changes of direction were far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. The incident created a great deal of discussion in Portugal, where the population is very interested in the problem of unidentified flying objects. Many Portugueses [sic] believe that the phenomenon poses a serious scientific problem and deserves careful study. The pilots who sighted the objects have been interviewed by students of the subject and they stand firmly behind their report. They insist that what they saw could in no way have been conventional aircraft of any kind. The incident will be a source of speculation for a long time to come."

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book report. The image shows a newspaper clipping with text describing a report related to the Sputnik II satellite.

Contrary to an earlier report, Sputnik II may be visible tonight to Daytanians Kenneth E. Klassen and Vernon said yesterday. The satellite should be seen at 7:58 p.m. at 23 degrees above the western horizon. The satellite should reach its highest point in the sky at 25 degrees above the western horizon. The satellite's highest point in the sky is about 25 degrees above the western horizon. The satellite should reach this point about 10 minutes after it is first seen.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for FEBRUARY 22, 1958

ARMY USING INVISIBLE LIGHT TO CARRY MESSAGES

The Invisible rays of invisible light are being used by the Army to transmit messages through the air. Using this technique, the Army can communicate with troops in the field without the knowledge of the enemy.

Radio and wire messages can be tapped and intercepted by the enemy, but these invisible light rays cannot be picked up or disrupted by physically connecting a device to the beam. Over the horizon, the invisible light rays can be transmitted to a receiver that converts the light signals into communications.

This invisible light communication system has several advantages. It is not affected by weather conditions and cannot be jammed or interfered with by the enemy. Since the transmitter and receiver do not require an actual physical connection, the communication system is very difficult to locate and tap.

The Army is studying how to best utilize these new invisible light communication techniques on the battlefield, where enemy forces cannot detect or disrupt the transmissions.

METEOROLOGY

See Advance
Storm Warning

Descriptions of the formation of hurricanes and predicting the paths of these giant tropical storms are given in research being done at the Smithsonian Institution.

D. S. Gentry and R. H. Simpson of the Weather Bureau's National Hurricane Research Project, West Palm Beach, Fla., reported meteorological data yielding new clues to the basic mechanics of hurricanes. They believe some of the complex features of the great storms may be unraveled.

During this, hurricane season, means obtaining accurate forecasts have become increasingly important to civil defense agencies themselves. The natural disasters threaten damage and loss of life during the peak of the hurricane season.

Any clue to the complex meteorological information concerning these storms is of vital importance.

The meteorological conclusions of the researchers are among the newest information.

JUPITER MAKES APPEARANCE
March, the month that sees the official end of winter with the coming of the vernal equinox on the 20th, is also a good time for observing the planets.

BY JAMES STOKLEY

WITH THE COMING of March the planets Jupiter and Saturn are the most prominent in the evening sky, as shown by the charts. These show how the sky looks about an hour after sunset on the dates indicated.

Jupiter is low in the southwest at the beginning of the month and two hours earlier at the end.

Jupiter is low in the east in the constellation of Virgo, the virgin, to the left of the two stars known as the "Pointers." This is a good time to observe the planet, as it is then highest in the sky during the evening hours. Its light also shines with a brilliant gleam.

But Jupiter is not the only planet to be seen in March. Saturn, which is in the east at the beginning of the night, is also a conspicuous object. For several evenings around the 20th, as if it were trying to compete with Jupiter, Saturn becomes noticeably brighter, until it appears almost as brilliant as its fellow.

When it is high in the south, which it now is, with its rings tipped to the right at a rather low angle, Saturn makes a beautiful telescopic object. Through a good amateur telescope, the rings and the ball of the planet can be seen.

Following the Zodiac Path
To the left of the Centaur, the Constellation Cancer, the Crab, has other conspicuous objects which are interesting to observe. For example, the path through which the sun, moon and planets move, known as the zodiac, can be traced through this constellation.

One can see it passing from west to east, and the bright star cluster in the crab, known as Praesepe or the Beehive, is near the middle of this path. This is a conspicuous star cluster, easily seen with the unaided eye on a clear night.

Besides these, there are other interesting things to note about Cancer. On the following pages are the descriptions in order from brightest to faintest, of the various stars and star clusters in this region of the sky, which are shown on the two sky maps.

The text appears to be neatly typed and formatted, covering topics related to the movement of Mercury and providing astronomical details.

Mercury's Revolution
Mercury is the innermost planet of the solar system. It revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit at a distance of 36,000,000 miles. The diameter of Mercury is 3,000 miles, one-third of the earth in 88 days.

While it makes one such revolution, the earth also has been moving, so Mercury catches up to it every 116 days, when it comes into "inferior conjunction". Then, of course, it cannot be observed, since it is in the glare of the sun. But in its farthest away position from the sun, it can be observed for a short time in the morning or evening sky. This is called an elongation.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

MARCH 29, 1958 - PONTIAC, ARKANSAS
On the night of March 29, 1958, a 24-year-old man, his younger brother and other friends, drove out from Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, looking for a "flying saucer" with their flashlights. They had sighted a bright object in the sky several days before and wanted to see it again. 

After driving some distance, they spotted a bright, glowing object in the sky a few miles away. It was about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and seemed to be hovering over the ground. As the group approached the object, it started moving. They followed it in their car, shouting at it. The boys were quick, however, and they reached the car ahead of the object. 

When the object came closer, the boys said its hair "stood up on the back" of his head. As it drew nearer, the object appeared to be surrounded by a bluish glow. The object then went behind some trees and the group lost sight of it. After a short while, they spotted the object again, this time moving rapidly through the trees. It disappeared from sight.

The group continued driving, hoping to see the object again. At one point, the road curved toward a hill. As the car climbed the hill, the object was spotted again, hovering just above the treetops. As the car approached, the object shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The group then returned home.
