Mystery Object
Sighted in Sky
Over Southside

Richmond (AP)—A mysterious and shiny "thing" flashed across the Southside Virginia horizon yesterday and—Astronomers, Weather Bureau officials and science fiction fans were taking turns today guessing what it was.

Was it a meteorite? Was it just a bright star, perhaps? Or—how to explain—a flying saucer?

Hundreds of folks in the Southside region swore it was real. They described it as about a "thing".

To some it appeared round. To others, big. To some very big. To others, small.

[Some text is illegible in the bottom portion of the article]

At the University of Virginia Observatory said the same thing. L. D. Rubin, a Richmond area weather man, volunteered an answer, though "Nothing but a fireball," said Rubin. A fireball is a huge meteorite which usually spied nothing out of the ordinary.

State police dispatched a trooper into Powhatan, scene of most of the reports. The trooper noted headquarters that he had spied nothing out of the ordinary.
