Mystery Object
Sighted in Sky
Over Southside

Richmond (AP)—A mysterious and shiny "thing" flashed across the Southside Virginia horizon yesterday and astronomers, Weather Bureau officials and science fiction fans were taking turns today guessing what it was.
Was the "thing" a meteorite?
Was it just a bright star, perhaps?

Or—here we go again—a flying saucer?
Whatever it was, hundreds of folks in the Southside region swore it was real. And 'that was just about all they could agree on about the "thing."

To some it appeared round. To others, oblong.

To some it was big. To others, small.

Sheriff W. F. Simpson of Powhatan County described the "thing" as very high and in the shape of a smoking top, with lights flashing at its top part.

Commonwealth's Attorney William R. Fears said "it looked like a an egg."
Minister Cooper Garrett, traveling the Richmond-Petersburg turnpike at the time, said it was a

huge object, shaped like a glass 'S

Among the folks who might
know, Weather Bureau officials said they hadn't seen the weird phenomenon and therefore
couldn't offer any help. Astronom-

ers at the University of Virginia! Observatory said the same thing.
L. D. Rubin, a Richmond amateur weather man, volunteered an answer, though. "Nothing but a fireball," said Rubin. A fireball is a huge meteorite which usually

disintegrates long before it reaches the earth.

State police dispatched a trooper into Powhatan, scene of most of the reports. The trooper notified headquarters that he had spied nothing out of the ordinary.
