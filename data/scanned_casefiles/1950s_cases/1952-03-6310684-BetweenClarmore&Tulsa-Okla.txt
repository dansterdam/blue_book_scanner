Wright Air Development Center

REPORT NO.                    PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

On a flight from Muroc, California to Wright-Patterson AF Base on 7 March 1952, an unidentified flying object was observed between Tulsa and Claremore, Oklahoma. Wing Commander Kent was flying co-pilot on a C-54, at 10,000 feet cruising at 190 mph. At 0100, halfway between Tulsa and Claremore, a very bright light was observed at 1 O'Clock position moving slowly from right to left at the same altitude as the airplane. The object appeared to be another aircraft with a very bright light on it. As the object passed through the 12 O'Clock position, it went out one second and came on again. There were no navigation lights observed. When it passed to the left, it seemed to lose altitude and went out two more times. As it lost altitude, it finally went completely out. The weather was clear.

It was only one to observe the object. No interception or identification action was taken.

[Partially obscured text] made the statement that the object might have been another aircraft.
