OFFICIAL ATIC REPORT--NORFOLK, VA

A DC-4-type aircraft, piloted by 2 airline pilots, was approaching Norfolk, Va., 14 July 1952, about 20-25 miles out on NE leg of traffic at 8,000' when 6 unidentified objects were first sighted approaching a/c on heading about 60 deg at approximately 2,000'. When objects reached point under & slightly to right of a/c, one of the observers saw them roll up on edge and instantly shoot off on heading 270 deg. Along with change of direction, two more objects appeared from behind and joined formation. Speed of discs was estimated at well over 1,000 mph. When first seen, they were glowing on top side, with intense amber-red light. Diameter was approximately 100' (estimated) and they appeared perfectly circular. They approached DC-4 in narrow echelon and appeared to decelerate before changing direction. Rapid acceleration, climbing of 6 objects was noted; immediately after changing direction and flattening out, glow disappeared entirely. They reappeared at once, glowing brilliantly again, and then, remaining stationary position, diminishing on heading of 26o deg. Their glow was extinguished again, this time in sequence rather than simultaneously, and they were lost from view.

ATIC comments: Five jet a/c were in vicinity of Langley AFB at the time. After various checks, it was concluded objects were not the 5 jet a/c. Other checks for known airborne objects were made with negative results. Sighting occurred at 2012 EST for period of 15 seconds.

Conclusion: Unknown.

JULY 13, 1952 - NEAR NORFOLK, VIRGINIA (KEYHOLE-1953 P 37) 2 WITNESSES
AT 9:12 P.M. A GROUP APPROACHED DC-4 APPROACHING NORFOLK, VIRGINIA ON ITS WAY TO MIAMI. AT THE CONTROLS WAS FIRST OFFICER. THE SECOND OFFICER, BOTH MEN HAD BEEN FLYING FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS, WITH THOUSANDS OF HOURS IN AIRLINER COCKPITS. 
SUDDENLY AN OBJECT FEET IN DIAMETER, YELLOW-WHITE IN COLOR, APPEARED FROM NEWPORT NEWS WHEN A RED GLOW APPEARED AHEAD. THE PILOTS OBSERVED SIX HUGE, DISC-SHAPED OBJECTS RACING TOWARD THEM, BUT AT A LOWER ALTITUDE. THE DISCS, WHICH WERE FLYING IN THE FLAT POSITION, HAD A BRILLIANT ORANGE GLOW LIKE RED-HOT METAL. BY COMPARISON WITH GROUND OBJECTS, THEY SEEMED ABOUT 2,000 FEET BELOW. WHEN THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE 100 FEET IN DIAMETER, THE SIX OBJECTS WERE IN ECHELON FORMATION. THE LEADER AT THE LOWEST POINT. APPARENTLY SIGHTING THE DC-4, THE FIRST OBJECT ABRUPTLY SLOWED, ITS BRIGHT GLOW DIMMING NOTICEABLY. AS IT SLOWED DOWN, THE NEXT TWO OBJECTS WOBBLED FOR INSTANT TO MATCH COLORS. IT SEEMED THESE OBJECTS FOLLOWED THE LEADER AS IF THEIR SIGNAL HAD COME TOO QUICKLY. 
THEN IN UNISON, ALL SIX DISCS FLIPPED UP ON EDGE. FROM THAT BRIEF GLIMPSE, THEY SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 15 FEET THICK, BUT ONLY THE UPPER SURFACES GLOWED. THE SIDES AND UNDERBODY APPEARED TO BE DARK.
WITH A VIOLENT CHANGE OF COURSE - AT LEAST 150 DEGREES - THE OBJECTS STREAKED AWAY, FLIPPING BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL FLAT POSITION. THEY AGAIN LINED UP IN ECHELON, THEIR GLOW BRIGHTENING SWIFTLY AS IF FROM AN INCREASE IN SPEED.
A SECOND AFTER THIS, TWO OTHER DISC-SHAPED OBJECTS RACED UNDER THE DC-4 AND JOINED THE SIX AHEAD. IT TOOK TO CATCH UP. THESE TWO SEEMED TO GLOW THE BRIGHTEST OF ALL.
JOINED THE OTHERS WHEN THEIR GLOW REAPPEARED. THE PILOTS SAW THAT ALL EIGHT OBJECTS WERE NOW IN LINE, HEADING WEST. THEY CLIMBED TO A HIGH ALTITUDE AND QUICKLY VANISHED IN THE NIGHT. 
ESTIMATED THE OBJECTS' SPEED WITH A DALTON MARK 7 COMPUTER. THE DISTANCE COVERED, FROM THE FIRST SIGHTING TO THE POINT OF DISAPPEARANCE, WAS ABOUT 50 MILES. THE STRANGE OBJECTS HAD TRAVELED THIS DISTANCE IN NOT OVER 15 SECONDS, OR AT A SPEED OF 200 MILES A MINUTE.

There is no photograph present in this document. The document appears to be a textual report on a UFO sighting that occurred on July 14, 1952 in Chesapeake Bay, Virginia.

The text of the document is as follows:

UFO SIGHTING
CHESAPEAKE BAY, VIRGINIA
14 July 1952

A DC-4-type aircraft, piloted by 2 airline pilots, was approaching Norfolk, Virginia at approximately 2:30 p.m. EST on 14 July 1952. The aircraft was at an altitude of 6,000 feet. Just as the aircraft was about 60 deg. to the right, two objects were first sighted approaching a/c on heading about 60 deg. at approximately 2,000'. 
When objects reached a slight to right of a/c, one of the observers saw them roll up on edge and instantly shoot off on a heading 270 deg. After this display of maneuvering, the two more objects appeared from behind and joined formation. Speed of these objects was estimated at well over 1,000 mph. Their display of directional changes, stops and starts was astounding. Close-in color (brilliant on (side) brilliant and pulsating. They appeared perfectly circular. They approached the DC-4 in narrow echelon, and appeared to decelerate before changing direction. Within milliseconds, a dimming of glow was noted; immediately after changing direction and flashing out, a sudden re-intensifying occurred. This re-intensifying occurred on two occasions. Their glow was extinguished again; this time in sequence rather than simultaneously, and they were lost from view. Sighting commenced at 2012 EST on 14 July 1952. Total duration of sighting was 15 seconds.

Air Force Comments: Five jet a/c were in the vicinity of Langley AFB at the time of observation. After thorough checks with surrounding Air Force channels it was concluded that the 5 jet a/c. Other checks for known airborne objects were made with negative results.
Air Force Conclusion: Unidentified.

The sighting is one of the so called "classics." This sighting has been included in the books of Edward J. Ruppelt, THE REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, Doubleday; Keyhoe: FLYING SAUCERS, Doubleday; and Donald H Menzel and Lyle G. Boyd, THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS, Doubleday.

1. At approximately 2200 hours, 16 July 1952, two objects were observed in the sky over this base. The objects were first sighted in the southwest at an approximate altitude of 10,000 feet traveling at a speed estimated to be between 600-700 mph.

2. The objects were observed to suddenly change direction to the northwest and accelerate to a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 mph. After reaching this high speed the objects were observed to suddenly make a sharp turn and disappear from view.

3. The objects appeared to be round in shape, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and were observed to emit a red-orange glow.

4. Observations were made by Captain XXXXX, the Base Operations Officer, and other members of the base personnel. All observers were experienced in the identification of aircraft. The sighting was also confirmed by the control tower operator.

5. This report is being forwarded for your information and analysis.

OBJECT OBSERVED WAS EMITTING A BRILLIANT REDDISH AMBER GLOW AND ALL WERE 06
PROGRESSING ON A HEADING OF 69 DEGREES. DIRECTLY TOWARD THE PAA DC-4. THE 07
ALTITUDE OF THESE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE 8000 FEET. 08
PILOT CALLED THE NAVIGATOR'S ATTENTION TO THE OBJECTS AND BOTH OBSERVED THE 09
OBJECTS CLOSING IN THEIR DIRECTION. PILOT LOST SIGHT OF THEM WHEN THEY WENT 10
BELOW THE GLASS SHIELD ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE. HE IMMEDIATELY RELEASED HIS 11

THE NAVIGATOR, WHO WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE THESE OBJECTS CONTINUOUSLY. 13
IT RECALLED THAT JUST PRIOR TO THE TIME THE OBJECTS WERE BELOW 14
THE DC-4, THE FRONT ECHELON SEEMED TO BE DECELERATING BECAUSE IT APPEARED THAT 15
IT WAS CLOSER TO THE OBJECTS THAN IT HAD BEEN. 16

Transcribing the text from the document:

THE FRONT THREE OBJECTS FAILED TO HOLD THEIR POSITION IN RELATION TO EACH OTHER, WHILE THE REAR SQUADRON CONTINUED SMOOTHLY. THEN THE ENTIRE GROUP OF SIX OBJECTS ROLLED TO THE LEFT IN PERFECT UNION AND THEN RECOVERED TO LEVEL FLIGHT.
INSTANTLY THEREAFTER, THE ENTIRE GROUP OF OBJECTS CHANGED THEIR DIRECTION TO A 150 DEGREE CHANGE...NO SIGN OF ARC WAS OBSERVED.
THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE WEIGHTLESS AND CHANGED A 150 DEGREE DIRECTION IN SILHOUETTE AND IRREGULAR DEVICES.
UPON COMPLETION OF THE TURN, THE SIX OBJECTS EMITTED A VERY BRILLIANT GLOW...THE LIGHT WAS CONVENTIONAL, UNCONVENTIONAL OBJECTS EMITTING.
THE RIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL FORMATION, ALMOST INSTANTLY THEREAFTER, ALL REAPPEARED IN THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION.
REAPPEARED ON THE OBJECTS INSTANTANEOUSLY AND THEY APPEARED TO BE IN A STEEP CLIMB...THIS TIME RECOVERED AND LEVELED OFF.
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THEY WERE LOST TO VIEW. THE OBJECTS WERE DEFINITELY NOT CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
ESTIMATED VELOCITY DEFINITELY EXCEEDED 1,200 MILES PER HOUR.
ESTIMATED SIZE OF OBJECTS 30 TO 40 FEET IN DIAMETER. ESTIMATED ALTITUDE 10,000 TO 15,000 FEET.
ESTIMATED SPEED, BY USE OF A PENCIL HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH, APPROXIMATELY 1,700 MILES PER HOUR.
ESTIMATED LENGTH OR DIAMETER WAS FROM 30 TO 40 FEET, IN RELATION TO THE CITY AND SURROUNDING AREA.
THE WHOLE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A DULL GLOW WITH STEADY GLOW OF LIGHT, AND MORE RED THAN AMBER.
THIS LIGHT ON TOP OF THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE INTERMITTENT AND NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE OBJECTS...SINCE IT WAS NOT REFLECTED OFF THE OBJECTS.
IT DID NOT PULSATE BUT WAS STEADY, AND THE OBJECTS WERE SHARPLY OUTLINED.
THERE WAS NO CORONA OR HAZY PERIPHERY SURROUNDING THEM. THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT WAS IN RELATION TO THE RATE OF ACCELERATION.
THE SIDE GLOWING APPEARED RELATED TO THE DIRECTION AND SPEED OF THE OBJECTS.
IT WAS FOUND THAT SEVEN TO EIGHT SECONDS AFTER THE OBJECTS CAME INTO VIEW, NO EXHAUST FLAMES OR TRAILS WERE OBSERVED.
OF THE 25 OR 30% OF PASSENGERS ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT OBSERVED THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS, HOWEVER, THE AIR FORCE ADVISES US THAT 7 TO 10% OF THEM WERE OUT OF NORMAL COLOR VISION.

WHEN THE OBJECT PASSED WITHIN 300-400 YARDS OF THE I-0-4, THE PILOT AND OBSERVER SAW THAT IT WAS OVAL IN SHAPE, EMITTED A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT, AND HAD NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION. AS THE OBJECT PASSED, THE PILOT OBSERVED THAT THERE WERE NO MARKINGS OR APPENDAGES OF ANY KIND, NO FLASHING LIGHTS, AND NO MEANS OF STEERING OR CONTROLLING THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT THEN SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN SLIGHTLY AND CONTINUED ON A STRAIGHT COURSE TO THE NORTHEAST AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 400-500 MPH.
2. THE LIGHT WAS SIGHTED BY THE PILOT AND OBSERVER OF THE I-0-4 AIRCRAFT DISTINCTLY AND FOR A SUFFICIENT LENGTH OF TIME TO BE ACCURATELY OBSERVED AND REPORTED. THE MANEUVERING OF THE OBJECT, PARTICULARLY THE APPARENT ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION, IS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. THE OBJECT WAS UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND APPEARED TO BE OF UNCONVENTIONAL DESIGN AND PROPULSION.
3. THE GLOW OF LIGHT ON THE CAP SURFACE WAS RELATED TO THE POWER SOURCE, AND HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE ON SOME PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS. THE ABSENCE OF SOUND-NOISE, VIBRATION, OR FLAME, COUPLED WITH THE APPARENT SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY, STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OF ANY KNOWN TYPE.
4. THE LIGHT DID NOT PULSE, BUT WAS STEADY, AND THE OBJECT DID NOTAPPEAR TO BE AFFECTED BY WIND OR GRAVITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS A NORMAL AIRCRAFT. IN SHORT, THE APPEARANCE, MANEUVERABILITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE OBJECT SUGGEST THAT IT WAS NOT OF CONVENTIONAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
F - The objects are definitely not of earthly origin.
CONTENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
The observers are considered reliable, and evidently saw what they described. The witnesses were in view for about 2-3 minutes, and gave a detailed account of what they saw. They were unable to identify the objects and were quite puzzled by them. They kept the objects in view until they disappeared from sight. After the incidence, the observers were interviewed by the intelligence officer, and they gave him the details again as they had reported them.
It is considered that they were in a good position to observe, and their observations are worthy of credence. The objects flew at a very high altitude and speed, and maneuvered in a manner which would be extremely difficult for any known earthly aircraft. The intelligence officer stated that in his opinion the objects were not of earthly origin.

2300 hours while sitting in his automobile at an outdoor theater north of Mouasseur, Morocco, the witness observed several objects in the sky. The objects appeared to be on a fixed course moving from south to north and appeared to be about 500 feet and moving at a very rapid rate. Three objects took several minutes to pass overhead. The witness stated that the objects seemed to be controlled by some external means and that their paths were erratic with sudden stops and changes in direction. The witness could not determine the exact nature or size of the objects, but he said that the flame and light end trailing behind the objects were several smaller solid or flame objects that appeared to be under the control of the main objects. The witness estimated that the objects were about 500 feet in diameter and were varying greatly in speed, some objects or direction of flight. The witness considered the experience unusual but was unable to draw any conclusions as to the exact nature of the objects.

CASE 11
15 July 1952

A red type piloted by 2 airline pilots, was approaching Norfolk, Virginia, about 30-35 miles out on the US 17 leg of the range, at 8,000' when 6 unidentified objects were first sighted approaching eye on a heading of about 60 deg at approximately 7,000'.

The objects were observed to make a right turn of 90 deg at a distance of 1 to 1 1/2 miles, b-lina at a speed of 1.5 to 2 miles a minute, markedly faster than the airline pilot's ship. After the objects had made this turn they continued on a heading of 270 deg, rolling back to a flat position. This change of direction was made with the suddenness of a bullet as flashing out past a stone wall after the first change of direction two more of the objects appeared from behind and to the right of the DC-4 and joined formation. The objects were estimated to be over 1,000 mph. When first seen, they were closing on the top side with an intense amber-colored light, and resembling a glowing red hot coal. Their diameter was approximately 100' (estimated) and they appeared to be perfectly circular. They approached the DC-4 in a narrow echelon formation, almost in trail, and appeared to accelerate just before changing direction. With the acceleration, a blinding of their intense glow was noted, and immediately after this change, the glow disappeared entirely. They reappeared at a distance, glowing brilliantly again, and began climbing on a heading of 270 deg. Their glow was extinguished again, this time in sequence rather than simultaneously, and they were lost from view.

ATIC Comments: Pilots jet n/s were in the vicinity of Langley AFB at the time of observation. After various checks with operations, it was determined at the time that no other aircraft were in the area. Other checks for known aircraft prove negative. Sighting occurred at 2012 EDT on 15 July 1952 for a period of 15 seconds.

Conclusion: Unknown.

3. Interview with Lt COLE:

He is a pilot with the 6148th Tactical Control Squadron, TAC, 5th Air Force. Pilots were flying their aircraft on a routine training mission over the MANCHURIAN BORDER, KOREA, on 7 July 1952. At approximately 1232 hours, two unidentified aircraft approached their flight of aircraft. These unidentified aircraft appeared to be flying at an estimated speed of 600-800 mph, and were observed for approximately 15 minutes. The pilots obtained a good visual observation of the unidentified aircraft and stated the following narrative record:

"I was the first pilot, and the other pilot was [REDACTED]. We were flying our aircraft in a routine training mission over the MANCHURIAN BORDER, KOREA, on 7 July 1952 at approximately 1232 hours, when two unidentified aircraft approached our flight. These unidentified aircraft appeared to be flying at an estimated speed of 600-800 mph, and were observed for approximately 15 minutes. The objects seemed to be metallic in appearance, and had a long, cylindrical shape, with no wings, tail, or protruding parts. The objects emitted no smoke, flame, or exhaust, and their flight path was a series of abrupt changes of direction, with no circling or maneuvering as would be characteristic of our aircraft. At the time of the sighting, the flight was at an altitude of 20,000 feet, and there was excellent visibility. Both pilots stated that the objects were unlike anything they had ever seen before, and that they could not identify the objects. It is difficult to judge the exact size of the objects, but they appeared to be in the range of sixty to eighty feet in length. The pilots did not obtain any photographs of the objects because the aircraft were not equipped with cameras that were ready for this type of mission. As the objects approached, my aircraft was at 20,000 feet, heading 040°, and the objects seemed to be on a collision course. Just prior to the closest point of approach, the objects made an abrupt 90° turn and continued on a south-southeast heading, maintaining their original high rate of speed. At the time of the sighting, ground radar was not operational in that area, so no positive radar tracking was obtained. The pilots stated that the objects seemed to ignore their presence, and maintained their original course and speed throughout the encounter."

DO NOT CIRCULATE (Confidential)
Sighting by personnel near Cazneau base in French Morocco on the 7th of July, 1952. At approximately 1545 hours local time, several personnel observed two (2) other unidentified aircraft coming from the north and heading in a southerly direction at a very high altitude. These objects appeared to be much larger than the jet aircraft stationed at that base. The objects were seen to make a sharp right turn and disappear in the clouds. The initial sighting was approximately 15 minutes.
4. In accordance with AFOIR Letter No. 'D' dated 23 October 1959 and related directives, the following information is being forwarded:

DOCUMENTARY
Text from the document:
On 12 July 1952, the text of an article which appeared in the "Atlantic Review" on 5 July 1952, the following was reported by Bud Gardner:
"Flying Saucers" have been seen in the Casablanca sky. And their flight over the city was observed by several people for about ten minutes. The T.W.A. station manager here, the following is a statement by Bud Gardner:
On the roof terraces at the Play Club last night when all of a sudden Danny Louis said "Look, Look, Look". With that, 24 Louis (Bunny's husband), O. D. Griffin, Mrs. V. Knoll, her husband and her daughter, Batty Handcock and myself looked up to the sky. Very rapidly, what looked like a formation of about 20 to 30 objects passed by, giving the impression of some glowing discs or metallic objects.
The formation appeared to be the same type used in military air maneuvers with one trailing the other.
When we first saw them, they were about "one o'clock" and moved across the sky about "three o'clock" in a matter of seconds. We just couldn't believe our eyes. Had one or two people seen them it could have been considered an optical illusion, but with five people observing them, we know that they could not have been the lights of an aircraft, nor anything else we are familiar with. These glowing objects were completely silent, and no sound was associated with them.
Some must have had different versions of what the shape of the objects were, because we all had a different opinion of what they looked like. Looked like, looked like reflecting objects, some like discs, and the general opinion was that they were of metallic construction.

DETAILS: (Continued)
with Bureau of Standards and Development Division during World War II. He visited Morocco under official cover as an American civilian aeronautical engineer. He was stationed at Wright Field, D.C. No other persons or crew or passengers aboard accompanied him on this journey.

Weather and Wind Conditions: Weather at Nouasseur, Viruandie, Morocco, was clear and calm. Wind was negligible, 2 to 3 miles per hour. At the town of Sefrou, 34 miles from Nouasseur, it was raining and the wind velocity was from 15 to 20 mph from the southwest.

Meteorological or other Conditions: No meteorological or other conditions.

Persistence of Any Physical Evidence: No physical evidence remained.

Information of Illumination: Additional information is not available on this case. The report is based on a message received, indicating that:
"A report was received from the Office of the Air Attache, American Embassy, Rabat, Morocco, stating that a "flying saucer" was observed on or about 22 June 1952 at Nouasseur Air Force Base, approximately 15 miles from Rabat. This report requested that a thorough investigation be made and the results forwarded to this office."

The following information were gathered during the course of the observation of the unidentified type aircraft:

a. The saucer was in a controlled formation, and during deceleration, position was in relation to a companion craft that had made a similar approach but did not hold as long.

b. The glow or light on the top surface was related to the propulsion system in operation. It diminished as the object descended and approached the ground.

c. Indications of the object's size was estimated at ten to fifteen feet.

d. The object did not respond to natural laws, and appeared to maneuver in a manner suggesting electromagnetic propulsion or control.

e. No physical characteristics were noticeable except that it was noiseless and appeared to be under intelligent control. It did not reflect or project any beam or light, and there were no exhaust emissions observed.

f. During the period of observation, the object was tracked by radar and photographed, but no results have been received to date.

Dear Tom:

Regarding the notification made by you on your publication. I have thoroughly checked the case file and I cannot agree to the changes you have indicated. My only reason for not agreeing to the changes is that the situation as I see it is that the cause of the sighting may really lie in a singular and probably mundane case. My request to point out a number of things about the modifications.

1. The word "sequence" is the exact word used by in his hand written statement.

2. "Sequence" is one thing, "irregular order" is another and they don't have the same meaning.

3. The case file states that the object was estimated to be 100 feet by using a pencil.

4. I can find no place in the record where it states that other persons observed the objects. 

That's all I can say in the record. I can find no evidence that would indicate that the weather visibility is stated in your article is the weather one that would have a sufficient probability to cause any interference that would give the apparent magnitude that others have mentioned.  

I'm sorry that I can't agree to your proposal now, but I have to be fair to the people who have had previous access to the case file.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

The lights were first observed at approximately 2145 hours on 7 July 1952 by the Novasseur AFB control tower operator and several other base personnel. The lights were observed to the west of the base at an estimated altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and were moving in a southwesterly direction at an estimated speed of 500 miles per hour. The lights were described as being whitish in color and were visible for approximately 3 to 5 minutes before disappearing. No sound was heard and the lights exhibited no trail.

Dear Lt. Flubb:

I was one of the two American World Airlines pilots who watched close red-orange lights maneuvering in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico on July 14, 1952. 

As I reported at that time, we were flying an air mail run from Houston to Miami. Suddenly we noticed an array of lights which appeared at about 27,000 feet altitude. After watching them for a two-hour session, we landed, and I immediately reported what we had seen to the control tower at Miami, and later to the other authorities concerned.

Since the experience which was so vivid, I have maintained considerable interest in other reports of similar incidents, as I feel the phenomenon is of the best informed. Any information you can give me regarding these sightings and the results of your investigations would be greatly appreciated, and would tend to satisfy my curiosity.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Very truly yours,
Lt. Cdr. Gair

INFO: ... we had no out of sight of identification except that the sky was clear with clouds and visibility was good. This OVNI flew rapidly at high altitude, straight and level, and crossed our sky from the west to the east in about 10 minutes. It was observed by two officers and one airman at NOUASSEUR AFB, MOROCCO. One of the officers tracked it on radar at a speed estimated at 750 mph and an altitude estimated at 35,000 feet. This OVNI appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape and was observed to be shiny or luminous. There were no sound or trail visible. The radar plot shows a straight course with no change in speed or altitude during the observation period. From previous reports, this seems to be one of the many similar type objects reported by observers at various locations. As a matter of interest, the officer tracking this OVNI on radar stated that the time of observation coincided with the overflying of the base by a scheduled USAF B-36 aircraft, but the radar target did not correspond in any way to the B-36 either in speed, altitude or course.

HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY
CAMBRIDGE 38, MASSACHUSETTS

January 13, 1952

Dear Capt. [Redacted],

I am really very appreciative of your thoughtful letter of January 13. I am glad to see that you have given this matter serious consideration. And, though I explicitly stated that I could not be of assistance in your investigation, I am pleased that you are continuing your efforts and I hope you will be good enough to let me explain my position, which I think is that of the average scientist at the Air Force, so that we may understand each other better.

I suppose that I cannot disguise you of your full right to inve3tigate this matter, but I am simply a person cooperating with the Air Force in an endeavor to suppress any misinformation and to give you in common with many others, are subscribing to "saucers" messages that the Air Force, for reasonly considering this to be necessary to meet an emergency that appears more imaginary than real, is seeking to impose restrictive measures on the dissemination of what appears to them inconstrovertible evidence than anything warrants.

However, the air force view may not be official and conceivably may be mistaken. I have always been an advocate of military secrecy only when I believed it to be necessary in the national interest. In the present case I strongly suspect that the military view is influenced by considerations that I cannot approve, and I would not be willing to become a party to imposing such restrictions. I have made my position clear in my talks. I have had opportunities to consider this matter from many angles and I have come to the conclusion that there is no good reason for imposing the restrictions that have been proposed. 

I was impressed by the fairness and restraint with which you have presented your case. I hope that the attitude of the Air Force will become more enlightened on this matter. If I can be of any assistance in making the problems involved better understood, I shall be glad to do so. However, I do not feel that I should commit myself to a position that I cannot fully approve.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

January 13, 1952

One further point. I am in as much casting aspersions on the honesty or the competence of airline pilots. ATIC files bulge with reports of unreliable pilots, both civilian and military. They constitute beyond question the most reliable data available. ATIC knows that reports similar to mine have been made, and full investigations of them are in progress. 

The great bulk of these reports has been solved. It is your definition of "solved" I question. Reasonable, no matter how experienced these pilots may be, who have often "seen" things which are now known to be merely reflections, balloons or other natural and terrestrial phenomena. After all, no one is questioning the integrity of the pilot or crew. The reports indicate only that these pilots, for whatever reason, have mistaken mundane things as strange objects. I am still more disturbed by the competence of the pilot or crew who have made the report. But, when we have such wealth of evidence as to their integrity, and can make errors of evaluation of what they have seen, I think I have every right to question your interpretation - not the observation itself.

Let me put this another way. If a six-year old boy comes to me and tells me that he has seen a dog or a cat out in the yard, I have no difficulty believing him. But if the Harvard University professor who lives next door to me tells me the same thing, I may be a little skeptical because, after all, this is the professor's field and he ought to know better. Uncertainty does not necessarily lie in the observed fact itself, but in the competence of the observer to make a proper identification. I check and find that perhaps he actually did see a strange animal scurrying about outside. The trailer looks like a bear, but really it is impossible explanation at all but a rather rare combination of circumstances.

If the boy reports that he has seen a lion in the yard, I am still more disturbed. I do not immediately accept his report, however. I do not know, however, whether he is lying or not. If I am other the other hand, the Harvard professor whom I know to be eminently reliable, reports the same thing, I am inclined to believe him, considering that a circus wagon might also have met with an accident, releasing a lion. In any event, I am much more impressed by report from a competent observer than from an inexperienced one.

Now, and finally (I think goodness), suppose that the boy reports that he has seen a green lion with two heads out on the lawn. I tend to disregard such reports, suggestive as they are of irresponsibility, perhaps he is simply playing a joke. In brief, he would fall in the "hogwash" class, unless it is satisfactorily explained that he must have seen something. I don't suppose that two-headed lions are a downright impossibility. I have seen several varieties of incredible beasts in my lifetime, mostly imaginary."

January 16, 1952

Observed in a bottle filled with formaldehyde and exhibited in a glass box. They may have been taken from a baled package that had obviously been submitted for many years. Usually nature makes some care of such freaks by killing them off at an early age for one reason or another but apparently they manage to grow to a good size and go on existing, creating some degree of consternation. It has become accepted, particularly, that the Darwinian theory of evolution is not wholly applicable to certain phases of life. They may represent an extremely primitive form, which had actually been in the state of developing for millions of years and which still retains in the adult form, the more complete double reflection of a general hollow to the central nervous system. They have an unexpectedly long head and appear to be characterized by a large mass of white crystalized material of a nature that has not been definitely determined as yet. It is intended that they be subjected to careful analysis for all of the factors involved. However, it is not always possible to apply the accepted reasoning to the types of living organisms encountered in the neighborhood and for some reason, which have never been noted to, the type should not be considered as coming within the established category... substantiate the story. But if I can come up with anything concrete that throws any light on the identification I do not have to speculate for I have a duty to do so. The Fay Island affair is of course a similar case. But you will no doubt recall that of the green, forest-like peculiarities.. do not have to depend such as to what he saw... you may be unable to reconstruct what actually happened across the date. The more critical thing is that, Captain ---------- is precisely the attitude that faces the scientist today, and for that reason it is not possible to condemn him in any way if he cautions that this is something more probable in the direction of the natural, rather than the supernatural, and that the natural laws of science are not necessarily what they seem. That, if any, is on you to prove that the other explanation is permissible. This merely that other critiques have been made in the neighborhood about the same thing as does not prove that the object sighted was the same as what was observed here, which is different and strange.

You refer to a TV program on which I was supposed to appear and did not. I simply that I am afraid to use my other informants and will not. It is only that I cannot reveal the identity of all.

The mere thing, Captain -----------, is to say that I am watching my theories... They are more than theories. They are facts. The reports submitted far back years ago are still being accumlated and still provide strong indication that ATIC files, however, as a physical and as a project in much generation, is a novel officer in charge of numerous missions and radar, and as an expert in many other fields comparable to those found by airlined pilots have been made for many years.

Transcribed text:

The nature of many of the phenomena have been known for many years. Both civilian and military observers have reported them, but their utility to mankind is presently unproved. I find that they are completely compatible with normal air phenomena and established norms. The Air Forces have investigated reports of them ever since they first received reports concerning this subject. But it has since become apparent that they have been frequently dismissed and proved that this was not proper and I am not saying, however, that I have done more than theories to support any lasting conclusions. 

Let us return to another point. Of course I do not know what you actually reported to ATIC. I suppose it takes a decidedly fairly important command that you think you have recognized, an importance that they think they have, however impossible under strict scientific-legal investigation. I have never been in a position to do more than indicate my qualifications. Even less, I have been informed of reports from individuals previously quite unknown to me, though I am quite sure that they were describing something out of the ordinary had they so wished.

It is true, however, that I welcome the opportunity to ask you a few more specific questions. I am not quite as native as you are however to this kind of thing so I was to something a little deeper and more precise on the side of a crack in a DCd, in order to judge the configuration of the observer.

There is a point of disagreement. I agree that you can estimate angular speeds and similarity speeds. This is a rough estimate of a course of the object. This means that they may not have taken a little more than a minute to estimate the course estimation has considered the full moon.

Now, if you know 7.8 sec it is quite the same size. Of course, this leads to the point that I do not argue much to the position of an image of an object of unknown size as it lies beyond our reasonable examination. It may be closing on us, partially show your figure, and destroy my ability to judge distance depends upon subtense angle as well as your subjective impression. The distance between two eyes is a 63 feet, for example. This seems to indicate that most people can judge distance accuracy beyond a certain number. In fact, the most people cannot judge distance at all, and must rely on other clues from the object.

Of course, as I look up the street, the situation is much different. I can see evidence that indicates the landing of some kind of craft, which is probably not at all strange. For one thing, there are imprints in the snow, to the right of my automobile, and part of it is disturbed in a way that I cannot explain by the wind or anything else. This first that I observe distinctly is that there are signs indicating some kind of activity in this area.

Things are different, on the whole, from the usual. I may be mistaken, of course, but it is indeed impossible for anyone - not even myself - to make certain judgments as to what may have occurred here. There are certain things concerning which I am unable to come to any definite conclusion just now.

It is, after all, conceivable that there may be a perfectly natural and ordinary explanation for what I see. This is just what I cannot make up my mind about at the present time. I wish I could explain what I think I saw. You can estimate for yourself how far this goes beyond the ordinary and commonplace. In the long run, I suppose, the affair will be satisfactorily cleared up, but in the meantime I am left with a feeling of uncertainty.

No, let me make a second observation regarding this case. The several different views of the landscape, including the sky overhead, seem to indicate the possibility of some unusual activity here. If, as I think, this point is established, it suggests that there may be an entirely new realm of natural phenomena to be explored. There is not your usual ground, nor anything he can explain in the usual way, that is to say, in terms of those people and things we are accustomed to see and accept as the normal order of nature.

I accept your suggestion about the matter, but on the whole I cannot see how an event of this sort could be satisfactorily explained in any ordinary manner. It is hardly likely to be mere coincidence. I am merely trying to find out some of the basic details that did not appear in the official report.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Place and Date of Intelligence: NOVASSEUR AFB, MOROCCO, 7 JULY 1952

Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. At 1830 hours on 7 July 1952 from Novasseur Air Force Base, Morocco, an object was sighted in the sky to the East by the sparras wing provost marshal. The object was bright and round and appeared to be about 12-15 feet in diameter at a distance of about 50 yards from the observer. The object was at an altitude of about 1,000 feet, and was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes. 

2. The object suddenly checked out and disappeared in the direction of the north. No deviation in course. 

3. Spanish national, USAF ground crew hired employee, sighted the object and stated it was an aircraft of some kind but of a very different and unconventional design, the wings were very short and object moved at a very rapid speed. 

4. The following reports were given to the Preparing Officer at Novasseur Air Force Base:

a. Capt. Ira Fairchild, AO 518332, Purchasing and Contracting Officer, 5th Air Depot Wing, stated that the object resembled a meteor, however, visibility was good - Object resembled a meteor, however, it was hovering and oscillating and then shot away at a very high rate of speed. 

b. Capt. Gerald M. Carleen, AO 519301, Deputy Director of Maintenance, 5th Air Depot Wing, stated that the object resembled a large ball of flame and was hovering and oscillating and then shot away at a very high rate of speed.

either the ATIC files or in your TRUE article. (At this moment I do 
not have either of them here in my office, while I am discussing, and 
some of the quotations I may make you may be erroneous.) But
it was never clear to me, until now, although perhaps it should have 
been, that we saw the object out of the upper window. I do not recall
with you, however, that you should have been relieved from the neces­
sity of checking on reflection, from motion, of which you are at least
mentioning. These are the interesting facts that not only
clearly valuable data are lost and irretrievable, but they 
know what you remember was not what we know now with
that the brilliant objects we saw were none of your reflections. To my
astonishment, your comment has been established from real others. They 
look like, move like, and have the basic characteristics of real objects. 
Except where you say the reflection is rather more detail than the ob­
ject itself. This, I think, is likely to have a hasty, transparent quality, 
but at critical stage I think you are bound to elaborate further as 
to why this could not have been a reflection from some bright object
exterior the light incident on the windshield. This, I have been trying to
find out one further point and thus far have had no direct answer.
Although I have a definite impression that the position of a L.G.M. I am not sure 
whether the side windows are vertical or not. I have the impression
that they are all inclined, so that the lower edge is further from the 
center of the cockpit than the upper.

I have already taken much too long on this letter. But, 
you see, I am trying to be thorough and diligent. Will you please give me 
again, if you will, the bearing of your craft at the time of the sighting
and its ground air speed. Will you please indicate where bearing on
which you first saw these objects and the angular attitude below or
above the horizon. Will you please indicate which window you saw
these from initially. Will you please indicate which window you were 
looking through during your visual observation. Will you then
indicate what window you saw these disappear from, and where you 
were situated in the cockpit. Will you indicate the bearing on which 
they disappeared. Were they higher and higher and higher and higher 
bigger and bigger as they came in and smaller and smaller as they 
disappeared. You have placed a great deal on their lighting so edge
but I am still not quite clear as to what happened at the end of the 
flight, or the beginning.

I should like to have an objective statement from you
since you emphasize this point. Will you tell me if you were a be­
liever in flying saucers prior to this sighting? At what time did you 
change your opinion if you were not? Were you 
actually looking for flying saucers and discussing them with
me shortly before you made your observation? Does that ...[redacted]

"Agree with your conclusion that these sightings were of the 13 January events.

I am further aware of the fact that a few people in the Air Force, mostly in a position to evaluate such things concerning my books, do not agree with the conclusion arrived at by Project Blue Book at the time. This is not the reason why it is brought up here, but rather to state the whole UFO business.

The situation is due to the bad questioning of the pilots by the various investigators. This is evidenced by the inconsistencies of the incompleted information of the group at that time. But the group now believes us at ATIC are doing a pretty good job. And one by one, to agree at least with my help, the classic cases are being eliminated.

You have made public statements, as have I, I claim that my friend is much changed from what I knew or saw from NIC? that I have heard from you to date.

Yes desire UFO's as I indicated, in a rather special way, so that an object change in the U.S. could be an unknown - but I enclose with this some reasonable close explanation as to why we should not call variable air line pilots, unusual, confused, many of them started by reliable airline pilots, experts, conscientious, etc. I cannot insist many reports where an airline pilot has pulled his plane up to try to avoid a sighter sighter I think that the trouble with the NIC viewpoint is the influence that desires should be withheld on the books have withheld on certain related. Certainly correct, will never settle for anything less than a completely contesting the Air Force and insist from there that flying saucers have stopped from other space father than UR's I frankly prefer the Blue Air term general phenomenon."

Capt. PAA
January 19, 1952

Definition implies the idea that Rappelt had toward the flying saucers from space and the interpretation of this, despite some discrepancy which he has and his views. He was not aware of the major objection hypothesis that I have proposed.

I am sending copies of this letter to, though I cannot through view show it with the same views. Sufficient the reader be informed that I am handling with care, lest he be falsely aware of his conclusions.

I have difficulties with the public relations to the view that there is any suspicion or controversy about what, as some persons believe. It is my opinion that there may be intelligent living in many places in the universe, perhaps on many planets, as is the case. If the interpretation of the vision of unidentified flying objects, sometimes called "flying saucers", by a number of reliable and technically trained observers during the past few years is correct, it would seem that travel through space by intelligent beings from some other world than this may be possible. If true, this interpretation would be of the greatest significance.

However, if the interpretations and conclusions are invalid, then the whole subject is not worth serious consideration. My reason for writing this letter is to explain my position and to reveal the considerations, doubts, and difficulties involved, and to seek your reaction. There have been many publications and much discussion about these possibilities; and I still feel that, no matter how unlikely they may seem, they should not be lightly dismissed. I am always aware of the possibility of self-delusion, and constantly strive to avoid it to the best of my ability.

I am tentatively scheduled to fly from Kansas City to New York on March 19, returning to Kansas City on March 22. I should have the good fortune to have you and may be allowed to meet with you to talk more about this. I will fly in complete confidence and hope that we might have a shorter to talk. I for one would welcome the opportunity.

Washington 6, D.C.

Dear Doctor Keyhoe:

Please reiterate the view element between your last letter and this later one, and I concur that the matters, flying in are not my only concern responsible.

Thus, you for asking the fine scion down your busy schedule to write a line page letter.

As work I have engaged the services for your intended your to write and may not have to have a person the return. In any event, I anticipate that you will not hear from me for an indeterminate period. We are urgently indicated that you have some contact by A.F.O.I. and as soon however a person that has been in communication with your office on the subject is presently my sole conduit.

1. Your request seems to all A.F.I. please.
2. Your depanking of Project Bluebook ("they didn't even even know what the hell was going on here,") is precisely academic. I want you to be careful in your use of this material, as it is rather desperately needed to "try to piece together the genuine."
3. Your annual inquiry is a letter to Dr. Manly - "By the way, how are the plans for the Congressional hearing progressing?"
Can certain your position on the position of the Air Force. 4. Your definite statement that the A.F. did not silence you could not permit me to assume that you now know if not closely associated with the matter. The F.B.I. advising that it is not a fact unrelated did not send any further instructions as to the matter.

The classic cases are being resolved.

If all this data the will as never been as officially formulated as this correspondent has observed, this U.F.O. business could be a little extra due they seem toward to the matter.

It is not necessary, as you claim it to be, that the government is informed the registered on the subject. Firm indications that the military intelligence on the matter are inconsequential as F.B.I.

SUBJECT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
NOVASSEUR AFB MOROCCO 
7 JULY 1952
1. THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AF REGULATION 200-2, DATED 14 SEPTEMBER 1950.
2. AT APPROXIMATELY 2200 HOURS LOCAL TIME ON 7 JULY 1952, A MASTER SERGEANT AND A CAPTAIN OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER NOVASSEUR AIR BASE, MOROCCO. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF THE SKY, MOVING IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 30,000 TO 40,000 FEET. THE OBJECT WAS TRAVELLING AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 600 TO 700 MILES PER HOUR.
3. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE SEVERAL ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION, BOTH HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY, AND AT ONE POINT HOVERED MOTIONLESS FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE DISC-SHAPED, APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 40 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND EMITTED A BRIGHT, STEADY LIGHT. 
4. AFTER BEING OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES, THE OBJECT INCREASED ITS SPEED AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION.
5. OFFICIAL WEATHER REPORTS FOR THE AREA INDICATE CLEAR SKIES AND UNLIMITED VISIBILITY AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. THERE WERE NO KNOWN AIR OPERATIONS IN THE AREA WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE OBJECT. 
6. IT IS THE CONSIDERED OPINION OF THE WITNESSES THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS NOT OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT ORIGIN.
7. PLEASE ADVISE OF ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR INSTRUCTIONS.

Text extracted from the document:

Be aware that you are on express in many fields of physiology and physics, and I do not at all claim to a complete understanding of your ability, but I am simply not satisfy with the simple explanation that you gave for the behavior of several objects who were apparently detected in your areas.

The duration of proof is the crucial factor. Doctor Turner, if you are aware of every single theory I have investigated, you must be amazed at the fact that this is still going on. Sub-normal cases, we know, must usually terminate in a certain way. Non-normal cases do not conform to the rules, so we have a very awkward situation on our hands.

In my records, I note that your postmarked envelope's date was 9/9/52, so it took your book a month to reach here.

DELETED is discussing a report on observations made on 7/6/52. Apparently a "Rescue Air Officer" was involved and made some comments. The report discusses the behavior of certain objects that were detected, and notes that the "duration of proof" is a crucial factor. It also mentions various theories that have been investigated, and notes that "sub-normal cases" tend to terminate in a certain way, while "non-normal cases do not conform to the rules", leading to an "awkward situation". The report also mentions that the postmarked envelope containing the report was dated 9/9/52, so it took a month for the book to reach its destination.

Transcription of the text:

"Baron George, Formerly, Science Editor of Time Magazine was talking your friend.

A capitol letter is placed in front of each paragraph herein to facilitate reference.

A. There are what appear to be more than a hundred variations in the report - your initial "object" has now become a "machine," "cigar-shaped machine," "torpedo-shaped machine," "rocket-shaped object," etc. As the man said, it is growing larger in your imagination. 

B. You refer to "a sudden acceleration and maneuver which I am unable to explain." In your report you said the object "seemed to stop and hover for about 5 minutes" and then "took off at a tremendous speed." This is hardly an "unexplained" maneuver - it is a known capability of virtually all jet aircraft.

C. You profess to be "disturbed" by the "implications" of this report. What implications? That we have some remarkable aerial devices developed by another nation? Or that we have them ourselves? Either possibility would be extremely interesting, but hardly disturbing. The implications are certainly not that flying saucers from another planet are visiting us.

D. The above were from recent letters. No DOUBT you are receiving mysterious calls, threats, visits, etc. Unfortunately, this is the price one pays for sticking his neck out. As the man said, if it is true, it is of the greatest importance - and if it is not true, it is a waste of time. In either case, I would suggest you to clean your own house before meddling in mine.

E. BILDERBACK mentioned in 1954. Ls an old curiosity called "Skunk Hollow." At the end of each paragraph, please refer to source, date, page, etc, so that I may check it in the records. We would be much more interested in investigating the possible espionage and subversive aspects that may be involved.

F. In a recent letter you also wrote, "We still have the names and addresses of some responsible citizens who were eye-witnesses." I would be delighted if you would furnish me with the names, addresses and statements of these witnesses. We would like to interview them in detail.

G. I would be most happy to discuss this matter further with you, provided you will clean your own house and cease and desist from this "meddling."

H. Your experience with the "horrible creatures" sounds very interesting, and I would like to hear more about it, if it is not too upsetting to you. It is obviously a matter of great importance and I would appreciate your cooperation in making a thorough investigation. Please advise when and where we might meet to discuss this further."

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"About 2300 hours on 7 July 1952, the undersigned received a telephone call from the Master Sgt at the Aircraft Control & Warning Station at Nouassseur Air Force Base, Morocco, reporting a sighting of unidentified flying objects.

The Master Sgt stated that approximately 8-10 lights were observed traveling at a very high rate of speed. The lights appeared to be traveling at an altitude of approximately 10,000 ft and were heading in a generally northeasterly direction. The lights were observed for a period of about 30 minutes and then disappeared from view.

It is possible for a HEAVY layer of stratosphere haze to conceal the upper layers of the atmosphere. This could account for the observed lights being visible at approximately 10,000 ft. The lights were observed through binoculars and the unaided eye. The Master Sgt described the lights as being round, about the size of a basketball, and about the brightness of a "bright star".

1. The side window of a B-24 is inclinated approximately 10 degrees from the vertical. On the night of 7 July 1952, a B-24 crew on a training flight from Nouasseur reported sighting several unidentified objects. The objects were visible through the side window, traveling at an estimated speed of approximately 300-400 knots.

2. Our weather reports show no unusual phenomena on the night of 7 July 1952."

OCR Output:
Initially, I saw them from my seat at the window, and I gazed at them for possibly half a minute or more. Their appearance suddenly attracted my attention from outside. I happened to be looking towards the front window, and I guess they must have appeared from behind the corner curved window as I saw them.

As they appeared to me, they were about 20 degrees above the horizon and west from the line of the front window. They seemed to be in an inverted saucer-shaped formation - that is, the bottom part was dome-like, and the top was flat or slightly concave. There was no trail or vapor stream behind them. Their color appeared to be a dull silver or aluminum, and they reflected the light from the sun slightly. Their speed was at least four or five times the speed of a jet plane, and they moved in a horizontal path, i.e., they did not climb or dive at any time while I observed them. Their motion appeared to be a steady progress, gliding, without any jerking or irregularity.

As I was both looking through the first window and then through the quarter window at the front, I noticed them very distinctly. In size, I would judge them to have been larger than a fighter plane, possibly two or three times as big, but this is a difficult dimension to estimate accurately. Their course was from west to east and rather high, as I previously stated.

The sighting lasted, as I mentioned, for possibly half a minute or a little more. Then, they simply disappeared from sight entirely as though they had been switched off. I did not see them break up, explode, or make any other abrupt change in their appearance. They just vanished, and I was unable to locate them again through the windows after they had disappeared.

Frankly, I was quite amazed at the sight and described it as accurately as I can recall. I have no other comments or conclusions to offer, save that it was a most unusual and unexpected experience.

The objects sighted are and an after-recovery. Said

The so-called "semi-static" brilliance of the objects.

The objects turned on edge and back flat again.
The objects assumed various eccentric maneuvers, however
understandable in the beginning, not understood later. They
made no apparent noise.

No other scientific or military personnel were witnesses, only
pilot, copilot and bombardier-navigator. Glare had the crew
blinded initially, too bright to determine shape and size. Shapes
varied, but could not determine exactly what they were.

The fact that the objects were observed between our aircraft
and the moon implies, if it had been a celestial source, is U.S.S.R.'s
capability to have this eccentricity, size and brilliance of performance, from a technical standpoint which we do not presently
possess. Therefore, if it is a celestial source, it would have
disclosed the fact of our previous lack of knowledge of this type
of performance. It is questionable whether any earthly device
could have exhibited the tactics and performance manifested.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"With reference to the mysterious "Flying Saucer" which was said to have appeared in the sky over Nouasseur AFB, Morocco, on 14 Jul 52, the following information is furnished:

There was a strong consensus among the officers who saw this object that it was indeed real and one of the most bizarre phenomena they had ever witnessed. Their descriptions of the object were fairly consistent, indicating they all saw the same thing.

The object was described as a large, glowing, slightly elliptical body, estimated to be about 60 feet in diameter, which moved with a very high rate of speed and appeared to be under intelligent control. It was observed to make abrupt changes in direction and altitude, and to accelerate rapidly when departing the area.

The object was sighted by several officers, including the base commander, and was tracked on radar for a period of approximately 15 minutes. Radar plot indicated the object was traveling at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,800 mph. 

...No satisfactory explanation has been found for this incident. The object did not resemble any known aircraft, either manned or unmanned, and its performance characteristics were quite beyond the capabilities of any aeronautical vehicle presently in existence."

In a new york time, aug 19 1952, an official report of the united states air force was revealed. They referred to a small strange flying vehicle, about the size of a small automobile, sighted over the novi ligure, italy air force base in morocco by air force observers on july 7, 1952.

It would be a mistake to have any serious speculation about the nature and origin of this object, since very little is known about it. no photographs were taken.

Text extracted from the document:

HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY
CAMBRIDGE 38, MASSACHUSETTS 

February 14, 1952

Dear Capt. [REDACTED],

I am certainly grateful to you for your letter of February 9. The report that you gave me was not prepared with the thought that it would receive wide distribution. I do not have time for a lengthy reply, but I shall try to answer a few of your questions.

Is the sightings report, I am not sure whether I am "adding to the Air Force files". Or whether they were willing to investigate. But for your consideration, I have enclosed a summary of the information received. The sighting referred to, and the discussion of it, has already been the subject of careful scrutiny and analysis. The conclifion reached, based on the circumstantial evidence, is that the object seen was a reflection. The "light" involved was traced to the lighted windows of a bomber. The "rapid ascent" and "rapid descent" were attributable to the movement of the bomber relative to the observer.

My recent access to Air Force files was denied since the incident was considered obscure and to be of no great consequence. The possibility of conveyance of certain information was hampered by certain instructions, not to be revealed - to be disclosed only officially. I believe that my position as a civilian is in the current position of the Air Force, who by official pronouncement still consider serious study of such cases as COMING within their purview. And from such disclosures and from my examination of the files, I have come to the conclusion that none of their explanations, including some of the classic categories, satisfies the situation of some of these cases. I was unable to obtain any voluntary assistance on their part. This continues to be a source of my disappointment. I am not criticizing, I am explaining this by way of information. It is not possible for me, by taking about dying gagets or investigating the sightings myself, to advance knowledge in this field. Perhaps some general improvement in the official position of the Air Force towards civilian participation in such matters might help me,

I am returning this to you in accordance with my custom of destroying material.

Capt. February 2, 1952

Book, incidentally, I should have indicated that it is this book that prompts my writing time to a debate with you and Dr. Hansey. I know though I may not express with any success what I am driving at, I certainly cannot believe and have fairly certain the position of the defences as a result of such contacts. This is something which I certainly cannot do.

I am not going over this question of burden of proof again, but the facts records show examples where one of the prime tests for a U.F.O. and points has been eliminated. This were supported pilots. The record of the matter was admittedly not thorough, and nothing was final and conclusive proof, that I have claimed.

As for the "solecism" when someone produces a text as a actual case of a possible sighting, however the point that I know cannot make with either you or Dr. Hansey, and certainly not with out particular pattern. We have definite answers for most of these, including even the "will to believe" that some of the cases where factual data is clearly missing, such as the possible the lack of of a Sighting or the lack of anything to match those cases where the data are available and where by consequences the identity of an extraterrestrial source was identified.

With reference to the reflection to the reflection on television. I do not recall ever having been consulted by television or I.V.H. Most of these I have to turn down because of the pressure of other business. Despite a number of times when I have written I prefer to refer in travel. Certainly, if I did turn that one down, it was not unkind to do with. I would have to compare dates to say, but I do not think I was out of the country. We would have to compare dates to see. But I do a tremendous amount of work through my office with nervous and yet I am not entirely certain through my office whether I should have accepted since it such an investigation from Capt. Hall other. I do not even know who he is.

Charles Manasy, who has also written me, and to whom I intend to send a copy of this letter, where I am of the chance "non-terrestrial "U.F.O.'s." This I expect to use this term "non-terrestrial".

Perhaps the reason why I am taking the time to correspond with you is due to the fact that your sighting is unique. I have not seen official records of each your claim that sightings like yours were seen in many areas.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DATE: 25 July 1952
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS SIGHTED NEAR NOUASSEUR, FRENCH MOROCCO, 12 JULY 1952
INFORMATION FROM: OSI REPORT, CAPT MARC D. ROSEN, CAPT, USAF

The text in the document discusses sightings of unidentified flying objects near Nouasseur, French Morocco on July 12, 1952. It mentions details such as the objects being metallic, silvery, and performing rapid maneuvers. The report was prepared by an OSI (Office of Special Investigations) officer named Capt. Marc D. Rosen.

Capt. February 14, 1952

I think it is highly unlikely that your sighting represents a non-terrestrial UFO, merely because the sighting fits the generally accepted pattern of the now familiar phenomenon. There is no certainty in reaching this conclusion. This is essentially a matter of opinion, based on the reasons for disbelief in this case which are as follows:

I do not think it was usefully commented on your description of a saucer-like object which was about the size of a basketball, moving at a high rate of speed with a number of oscillations or pulsations. One thing that it does not imply is that inertia can be nullified or overcome by some mechanism not subject to severe acceleration, in one direction would be only momentarily. Such mechanism would seem to require a departure from the laws of physics as we know them. Any rapid acceleration or deceleration in this direction would undoubtedly impose severe physiological stresses on any living creatures aboard. If you contend that there were no such effects this would cause the occupants to be thrown against one side of the interior, it would seem to me that such an effect would be highly improbable, if not physically impossible.

With respect to your question about charge of a single sizer, this is a very disperse. Only in the distant narrow sense, as in a vacuum tube, and usually only for the presence of a passing charged body, can you get a beam of charges of a single kind. The repulsive forces of these charges usually cancel out, so that no beam would be the normal result.

Case February 14, 1952

Card to Olapenga there. And you, if you are considering this a report, please disregard it. This is my delayed answer to the unusual occurrences near Nouasseur AFB, Morocco, Because it is inconsistent with "the law of physics and mechanics".

The details of the sighting. I have not had a chance to plot them on a diagram or analyze them. What confuses me is the fact is your statement that the witness horizon was considerably lower than normal. This would indicate that the object showed and distance covered in 13 minutes was 12 miles or approximately 58 miles an hour. Your stating the sighting was 43 minutes after sunset. The sky should have still had good visibility which contradicts the brightness of the object. The theoretical and of twilight is 6.11.

You have raised the question of the terrestrial explanations. It is agreed with your data with information. There are still plenty of terrestrial explanations that could be given to these occurrences. There are still plenty of terrestrial explanations that could be given to these occurrences. In my opinion, it is much further from the study these basic naturalist extraordinarily explanation. In my opinion, it is much further from the study these basic naturalist extraordinarily explanation. You refer to detection by other means. I am always a bit a few cases where reports are being heard of the Investigate. But they only came a shortly such as the Florida scout master, unrelated worse than the reported saucer.

With reference to your final question, there is nothing to support the claim to date from the Hydm 1949 probe to have been in the earth's orbit. It was certainly not a Harvard observation. 

I enclose herewith my tentative schedule on the form C-39 for us to consider and to discuss the subject at our next meeting. This would be a continuation.

Again, I want to thank you for your frank and belief to any questions. As I want to both know how these we stood.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 95--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

Three including: First Officer William E. Nash and Second Officer William H. Fortenberry. As a pilot spending much of his life in the air, Captain Nash had long been interested in the question of UFOs, and during the long night hours of over-water flights he had often seen the phenomena that he now felt to match the description. In five separate displays, various types of aerial phenomena appeared - strange lights, clusters of lights, blunted discs, and the multi-colored images of discs and oblique spheres. As a pilot, he had never seen any unidentifiable aerial phenomenon that appeared to be under intelligent control--until this particular night, when he was not watching for UFOs.

Shortly after 5 p.m. E.S.T. the plane was cruising on automatic pilot at about 5,000 feet over Chesapeake Bay, and approaching Norfolk, Virginia. The sun had set and the night was almost entirely dark except for a few dim lights on the ground. Fortenberry, sitting at the right as copilot, was staring intently at the dash instruments, and Nash, in the pilot's seat at the left, was studying out the city lights and landmarks of the route. Nash had just called attention to the Lights of Newport News and Cumberland, ahead and to the right of the plane, when at 8:12 a brilliant red glow suddenly appeared in the sky, apparently between Newport News and the aircraft, and so low that it might almost have been on the ground. One of our many incredible witnesses on first seeing a UFO. "What the hell is that?" Looking through the front windows of the cockpit, they watched two series of brilliant multi-colored lights performing horizontal course changes roughly a mile below the plane. Almost disturbingly, they perceived that the unknown was actually a procession of six red-orange lights, glowing like hot coals. Shooting forward like a stream of red tracer bullets, the line of lights moved out over Chesapeake Bay until they were only about half a mile away from the plane. They appeared to be sharply defined, large, circular disks, arranged in a narrow echelon formation-like a set of stairs tilted slightly to the plane's right, with the leader at the lowest step, each following disk slightly higher and to the rear, and the last disk at the highest point (see Figure 17). Realizing that the line was traveling away from them at a terrific speed, they radioed that the line was receding rapidly.

Text extracted from the image:

Figure 17. Reported movements of the Chesapeake Bay disks. (1) disks at the approach; (2) disks over and rescue; (3) the change in direction and velocity. Nash flipped off his seat belt so that he could move to the window on the side. During this brief interval he was not able to see the objects, but Fortenberry kept them in view. As he later described, their amazing behavior: all the disks simultaneously ceased their action and one by one flattened out to the right. Still on edge, they suddenly reversed their positions so that disk 6 became the leader (Figure 22).
This shift took place only a brief second and was completed by the time Nash reached the window. Both he and Fortenberry then observed the disks flip back from the concave to the flat position. In the same fraction of a second, the entire line changed direction as a sharply as a ball bouncing off a wall and shot away to the east. Two similar disks darted out, apparently from beneath the plane, and joined the line (Figure 23). The disks suddenly disappeared, immediately reappeared, abruptly began a steep climb to an altitude-above that of the plane, then vanished not in sequence, but all at one time. As described earlier, the ground controllers had tracked for a period of 12 to 15 seconds; their velocity would have been 1,200 to 1,500 miles an hour.
After a quick check showed that no one else in the aircraft had observed the lights, the pilots radioed a message to the CAA station at Langley Air Force Base. Officials there, and later ones at Newport News, had been in the region at the time of the sightings but they were ruled out as an explanation. Both pilots were informed that seven other persons, apparently on the ground, had reported wireless lights in the Norfolk area; the Air Force files contain no record of these reports and it is probable that these persons missed the most tantalizing details for UFOs.

A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE NASH-FORTENBERRY DISC

In the hope of solving the mystery, even though a decade has passed, the authors of this book have made a thorough study of the available evidence and present the results in the pages that follow.

We wish to thank Prof. C. R. Manning, who, through the courtesy of the U.S. Air Force, allowed us to examine the files of Project Blue Book and to discuss the case with several persons concerned in the investigation.

When observations relating to a strange phenomenon seem to point to a conclusion that contradicts the main body of scientific knowledge, the reaction of the scientist is generally to reject the evidence as questionable. This is impossible. The data of the Chesapeake Bay case indicate that something happened which is impossible by the standards of the Chesapeake Bay observers. The next step is to re-examine the assumptions on which the conclusion that the UFO had an extraterrestrial origin is based. The belief that the UFO had an extraterrestrial origin is based chiefly on two assumptions: first, that the estimates of the disk's size, distance, and speed were reasonably accurate; and second, that the disks were solid objects. If either assumption is unsound, the extraterrestrial theory is unnecessary and the incident becomes much less of a puzzle.

Both witnesses were alert and experienced observers. Nevertheless, their determinations of distance and size, and hence of speed, are open to question because of the very fact that the disks were unidentified phenomena. Angular estimates are usually reliable when an observer is judging the position and speed of other known aircraft moving in the sky. But when the moving object is a strange and unfamiliar one against an empty sky or flat ground containing no visible objects for comparison, the observer's ability to judge distance and size becomes very little. The ability to judge distance depends largely on the binocular vision of the observer's eyes, expanded by a span of about 2.5 inches. If an object is at any greater distance, they subtract an angle of about one-tenth of a degree, less than one tenth the diameter of the full moon. This is a physiological fact, and means that if the observer is more than 300 feet away from an object of unknown size, he cannot determine its distance accurately unless he knows how large it is. Using angular estimates, the witnesses in the Chesapeake Bay case calculated that at the point of closest approach the disks were a mile lower than the plane and about half a mile to the north-northeast. Mentally converting their angular estimates with that of a DC-3 aircraft at this distance, the observers arrived at an estimate of size-whose accuracy depends on having a known distance. The circularity of this process indicates the weakness of all such estimates. Even the most skilled observer cannot accurately judge the distance of an unidentified object when he does not know its actual size, and he cannot judge the size unless he knows its distance.

Over Stratford, Connecticut, on May 15, 1952, a cloudless day when visibility was unlimited, two Navy aircraft reported a near collision at about 2000 feet. The Navy pilot filed a complaint stating that the two planes had missed each other by a distance of only about 600 feet. According to the commercial pilot, the planes had had a leeway of about 4500 feet-a more than sixfold difference! [5] Thus good pilots can differ widely in estimating the position of objects in the sky, even known aircraft seen in full daylight. With an unrecognized phenomenon seen in fullness or in similarities, as in the Chesapeake Bay case, good estimates are impossible.

The extraterrestrial conclusion depends even more strongly on the assumption that the disks were solid objects. If they were not, the element of impossibility disappears and the case becomes merely the report of an unusual natural phenomenon. The authors believe that the disks were not solid objects at all, but rather masses of ionized gas or plasma, similar to ball lightning. This hypothesis explains their apparently impossible speed, size, and disappearance, as well as the circular, glowing appearance.

Extracted text from the document:

The second observation that the UFOs were material objects. Nearly every one of the descriptions is in direct conflict with this idea. The material of construction, for example, if performed by solid objects, should have produced a shock wave that would have blown vegetation to Norfolk. Newport News, and points west. Only one observation even suggests that the unknown had a material surface, which would indicate a solid body. The witnesses, specically qualified this statement, however, by adding that though the object appeared to be a solid body, it did not become clearly visible. Thus the three-dimensional structure was not actually observed, but only inferred. The night was dark, the UFOs were glowing like hot coals, and were apparently some strange light. Even if the disks had been solid objects, an observer could actually have seen only a circular-shaped light that gradually narrowed to a very thin ellipse; if he believed the object to be solid, he might infer the presence of other surfaces. But a silhouette is hard to ect thick and an unrifled bottom surface, even if they had been present, would not have been detectable.
Of the other observations, all are inconsistent with the theory that the UFOs were material in nature. All, however, are completely consistent with the theory that the disks were immaterial images made of light.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 97—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

Images made of light can glow with brilliant colors, can show well-defined counter-shapes, and can flip on and off. Since they are not subject to the forces of gravity and inertia they can travel at incredible speed, change direction sharply and instantaneously, and perform all of the maneuvers ascribed to the UFOs. On the other hand, these observations have become credible, and the major part of the problem remains unexplained.

Only one problem remains: just exactly what produced the images? Of the many possible explanations, we first considered the simplest, an astronomical source. The UFOs appeared to be in the sky as stars, i.e. 35,000 to 45,000 miles distant forty-five minutes after sunset. The night was dark, for the moon had just entered its last quarter and would not much later. Apparently, the only planet visible at that time was Jupiter, which is so bright that it would have been conspicuous. Moreover, since Jupiter set more than an hour after the sun, it should have been visible above the western horizon at the time of the sighting. But since it was not particularly brilliant, having a magnitude of a little more than -2.6, we put aside the astronomical theory, for the moment, as improbable.

We next explored the possibility of multiple reflections in the glass windows of the cockpit, produced by a light source inside the plane (such as a cigarette), or in the air outside (such as a searchlight). Like the astronomical theory, this idea was set aside as incredible. Learning to distinguish between a reflection and a real light seen through a cockpit window is part of every pilot's training. When he sees a strange light, he automatically makes the proper checks. Furthermore, Nash and Fortenberry had observed the disks through three separate windshield observations.

Accepting the overwhelming probability that the source of the UFOs was outside and below the aircraft, we concluded that it was illuminated by a light source, probably from the ground area near Newport News and Norfolk, with several airfields and military installations, included countless possible sources such as a searchlight, an illuminated advertising sign, or an aircraft. Stratification of light waves or temperature and/or humidity could have multiplied such a light into a series of glowing disks. The source of this theory, of course, depended on the prevailing weather conditions. According to the reports, on the night of July 14 normally a third of the sky was obscured, but was covered with thin cirrus clouds, practically invisible, at lower altitudes. Light, even and calm, and a temperature inversion existed. Under such conditions the suggested mechanism would obviously not operate.

A more detailed survey of the weather conditions, however, quickly showed that the picture was greatly oversimplified. At the time of the sighting, the night had already become quite dark. Yet the sun had set only forty-five minutes earlier, and, according to the observers, the disks should have ended until gone had time. Thus there must have been a dense cloud bank low in the west.

The document appears to be a news article from the "Atlantic Courier - Casablanca, French Morocco" on July 21, 1952, reporting on "Flying Saucers in Morocco" and describing various sightings of "Cigars and Luminous Locomotives".

The full text of the document is as follows:

FLYING SAUCERS IN MOROCCO (2)
Cigars and Luminous Locomotives !
By the last few weeks, brief reports have been published in the French and American Press giving accounts of the observations made by the people of Casablanca.
The most recent reports have covered new incidents which seem to be on the increase according to local LIFE.
No. 1 - was observed from the terrace of the American Pay Club in Casablanca by Mr. and Mrs. Ed Levin. Mr. and Mrs. J.D. Breit and two other members of the Club. According to their detailed report was published in the July 12th issue of Life Magazine.
Different Versions
We note that these five American observers had a different version of what they saw. Some of them thought they had seen elongated cigars, while others thought they had seen diamond shaped objects.
We understand the population of Casablanca have also seen objects of this nature as one followed and studied closely for hours it says the report. Blue-white neon light
The lighting corresponds to that usually produced by Mr. and Mrs. Idris Pierce, who describe these mysterious luminous locomotives as being about 9 p.m. The object was moving slowly from East to West, in a perfect silence.
Forty Witnesses
Party other people saw this incident and among them were in front of the Sangier-Sour four at Casablanca, and a French journalist, Monsieur Germicl and Monsieur Benoit, who were able to observe more details. This group was able to distinguish the speed, color, and size of the objects and counted more than forty witnesses.
Though all these reports covering what was obviously various sightings of these strange incidents No. 2, it would seem reasonable to assume that it was the same object which was observed at different times and places and by persons of high standing whose testimony is worthy of consideration.

to distinguish between a reflection and a real light seen through a cockpit window is part of every pilot's training. When he sees a strange light, he automatically goes through this problem. Further more, Nash and Fortenberry had observed the disks through three windshield observations.

Accepting the overwhelming probability that the source of the UFO was outside and beyond the immediate vicinity, it was considered that a celestial phenomenon near Newport News and Norfolk, with several satellites and searchlights on Jamestown and Williamsburg and the Surry power stations, accounted for the sighting. An illuminated advertising sign, or beacon, Stratford on the James River formed a condition could have multiplied such a light into a series of glowing disks. The accuracy of this centers on the prevailing weather conditions. According to the report, on the day following the incident a bright moon was obscured by high, thin cirrus clouds and there was some temperature inversion. However, it should be noted that, notwithstanding the night was cloudless and sharply clear, there was no apparent haze. Visibility was unlimited and no temperature inversion was apparently existing. Under such conditions the suggested mechanism would obviously not operate. 

A more detailed survey of the weather conditions, however, quickly showed that this theory was greatly oversimplified. At the time of the incident, the time of the sighting was precisely determined. Becoming quite doubtful the time element, the true solar elevation was calculated. This clearly showed that a moon phenomenon could not have existed and, therefore, the airplane, having sighted the objects, found that they should not have existed until about a local time. 

Thus there must have been a dense cloud bank low in the west. Also, according to Captain Nash, there was probably some unstable air which in itself indicates the possibility of temperature and/or humidity. 

A thorough study of the situation showed that inversions of both temperature and humidity must have been present. In the summer of 1952 all the eastern coastal stations from Maryland to Virginia reported extremely low temperatures and increased humidity, a condition which continued for over a week and was the cause of the lack of cloud cover during the day. In periods of heat and drought, the opposite condition marked inversions favourable to extreme reflection or reflection. Small in extent, existing only by day and August, temperature and humidity observations may not be detected by radioactive observations [s]. During July and August, temperature and humidity inversions occurred almost every night in the coastal regions and accounted for the radar angels so frequently observed during these weeks.

The fact that the sighting occurred over Chesapeake Bay is significant. A body of water absorbs more heat from the sun than the land and the air over water is warmer than that over land. The cooler air from the land is carried over the water by the land breeze and, under the warm air, is heated by the water and rises, so that the land and sea breeze front has a visible effect.

The air over a lake, river, or other body of water also has a higher concentration of moisture than the air over land areas, and this moisture, heated from below, can produce an extremely favorable condition for optical mirage, called discontinuities of both temperature and humidity, must have existed conditions the UFOS appeared. A light on the Virginia coast, shining directly overhead toward the plane, could not have been the object observed. A change in the orientation of the light or a shift in the location of the observer could have made by the disks.

Whether the plane was flying at a point speed of about 325 knots, 375 miles an hour, it would have traveled about a mile.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Also, according to Captain's notes, there was probably some moisture in the air, which in itself indicates inequalities of temperature and/or humidity.

A thorough study of the situation showed that inversions of both temperature and humidity must have been present. In the summer of 1952, the Chesapeake Bay area was subjected to extreme drought, and the ground cooled rapidly after sunset, causing the lake of cloud cover during the day. In a period of heat and drought, the nightly cooling preceding sunrise marked inversions favorable to excessive reflection or refraction. Small in extent, existing only briefly in one place, constantly changing location, such inversions may not be detected by conventional observations [sic]. During July and August, temperature inversions occurred almost every night in the general region and accounted for the radar angels so frequently observed in the Washington area during those weeks (see Chapter XX).

The first of the sightings occurred over Chesapeake Bay at midnight. A body of water cools more slowly than the land, and the air over water is warmer than that over land. The cooler air from the land is carried over the water by convection currents. Blows in and under the warmer air, is heated by the water and rises, to be replaced in turn by the further flow of cold air from the land. The air over a large, open body of water may contain pockets or other bodies of water who has a higher moisture content than over the land and can form an invisible haze. All these facts had been insufficiently to the conclusion that such sharp gradients of temperature and humidity must have existed over Chesapeake Bay on the night the UFOs appeared. A light on the Virginia coast, shining northward toward the plane, could easily have been spread out into a series of images like those observed. A change in the orientation of the light or a shift in the location of the inversion would account for the abrupt change of course made by the disk."

The Chesapeake Bay Case. 
Two of the most famous UFO cases, the Nash-Fortenberry and 
the Tombaugh sightings, have never been completely explained 
even though the witnesses have usually competent, the incidents 
fully described, and the basic facts not in dispute. Although the 
probable type of mechanism involved is clear in each case, determining specifically what factors combined to exactly what way to 
produce the phenomenon has so far proved impossible. Neither case, 
however, supports the theory that the UFO had an extraterrestrial 
origin.

GALLERY 96 - THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

Their many hours in the air, they had made careful estimates of the performance of these machines. Nevertheless, no reasonable explanation of the disks was found.

At the time of this incident flying saucers had been big news for many weeks. Both Life and Look magazines had recently published special discussions of the possibility that flying saucers came from other planets, and newspapers were printing dozens of reports of sightings by eye-witnesses, all coming through the air at meteoric speeds (see Chapter VI). At ATIQ, the small staff of eight men were swamped with saucer reports, far more than they could deal with properly, and some of the investigators were privately convinced that UFOs did come from outer space [1]. But public opinion, which was slow in coming to this conclusion, remained far behind those in the know.

The incredible velocity and instantaneous change of course reported were of course impossible for any earthly vehicle; no known metal could have escaped being melted by the friction and so swift a passage through the dense atmosphere at 2500 feet, and no human flesh and bone could have survived the instantaneous change of direction. Nash and Fortenberry frankly stated their own conviction: "Though we don't know what they were, what they were doing here or where they came from, we are certain in our own minds that they were intelligently operated craft from somewhere other than this planet." [2].

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report detailing the sighting of strange "flying saucers" near Norfolk, Virginia by two veteran Pan American Airways pilots.

Text from the document:

"Two veteran Pan American Airways (PAA) pilots reported today that they saw eight "flying saucers" near Norfolk, Va., last night.

W. B. Nash said he and W. H. Fortenberry saw six of the strange craft, estimated to be 100 feet in diameter and "glowing orange-red," fly in formation some 6,000 feet beneath their DC4. 

The six "things" turned westward sharply when the PAA plane passed overhead and were joined by two other similar flying discs, Nash said. The eight "saucers" zoomed upward to an estimated 10,000 feet altitude before the glowing light emanating from them "multiplied off" and they disappeared into the sky, Nash said.

Nash, 35, estimated that he and Fortenberry "watched the whole maneuver" for between 10 and 12 seconds.

Nash, a first officer for PAA and a flying employee for 10 years, said he and Fortenberry "would make the eight objects were definitely intelligently controlled -- whether from within or without the earth, we couldn't say."

"Also," said Nash, "we can be reasonably positive that none of us -- as we know pilots -- could physically endure the centrifugal force that would be imposed on the occupants when making these things of such violence as these objects showed."
