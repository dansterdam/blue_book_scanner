OFFICIAL ATIC REPORT--NORFOLK, VA.

A DC-4-type aircraft, piloted by 2 airline pilots, was approaching Norfolk, Va., 14 July 1952, about 20-25 miles out on NE leg of range at 8,000' when 6 unidentified objects were first sighted approaching a/c on heading about 60 deg at approximately 2,000'. When objects reached point under & slightly to right of a/c, one of the observers saw them roll up on edge and instantly shoot off on heading 270 deg. After change of direction, two more objects appeared from behind and joined formation. Speed of discs was estimated at well over 1,000 mphs. When first seen, they were glowing on top side, with intense amber-red light. Diameter was approximately 100' (estimated) and they appeared perfectly circular. They approached DC-4 in narrow echelon and appeared to decelerate before changing direction. With deceleration, dimming of glow was noted; immediately after changing direction and flattening out, glow disappeared entirely. They reappeared at once, glowing brilliantly again, and began climbing on heading of 270 deg. Their glow was extinguished again, this time in sequence rather than simultaneously, and they were lost from view.

ATIC comment: Five jet a/c were in vicinity of Langley AFB at the time. After various checks, it was concluded objects were not the 5 jet a/c. Other checks for known airborne objects were made with negative results. Sighting occurred at 2012 EST for a period of 15 seconds.

Conclusion: Unknown.

JULY 13, 1952 - NEAR NORFOLK, VIRGINIA       (KEYHOE-1953 P. 57)   2 WITNESSES:
AT 9:12 P.M. A PAN AMERICAN DC-4 APPROACHED NORFOLK, VIRGINIA ON ITS WAY TO:
MIAMI... ALL THE CONTROLS WAS. FIRST OFFICER [REDACTED] SECOND OFFICER [REDACTED]
WAS ACTING AS THE COPILOT. BOTH MEN HAD BEEN FLYING FOR MORE THAN:
TEN YEARS, WITH THOUSANDS OF HOURS IN AIRLINER COCKPITS.
CRUISING AT 8,000 FEET, THE DC-4 WAS A FEW MILES FROM NEWPORT NEWS WHEN A
RED GLOW APPEARED AHEAD. THE PILOTS OBSERVED SIX HUGE, DISK-SHAPED
OBJECTS RACING TOWARD THEM, BUT AT A LOWER ALTITUDE. THE DISCS WHICH WERE
FLYING IN THE FLAT POSITION, HAD A BRILLIANT ORANGE GLOW LIKE NEON METAL, OR
BY COMPARISON WITH GROUND OBJECTS, 2000 FEET BELOW THEM, THE OBJECTS APPEARED
TO BE 100 FEET IN DIAMETER.
THE SIX OBJECTS WERE IN ECHELON FORMATION, THE LEADER AT THE LOWEST POINT. I
APPARENTLY SIGHTING THE DC-4, THE FIRST OBJECT ABRUPTLY SLOWED, ITS BRIGHT
GLOW DIMMING NOTICEABLY, AS IT SLOWED DOWN. THE NEXT TWO OBJECTS WOBBLED FOR
AN INSTANT... TO THE PILOTS IT SEEMED THESE ALMOST OVERRAN THE LEADER, AS IF
ITS SIGNAL HAD COME TOO QUICKLY.
THEN IN UNISON, ALL SIX DISCS FLIPPED UP ON EDGE. FROM THAT BRIEF GLIMPSE,
THEY SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 15 FEET THICK, ONLY THE UPPER SURFACES GLOWED. THE
SIDES AND THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE DARK.
WITH A VIOLENT CHANGE OF COURSE -- AT LEAST 150 DEGREES -- THE OBJECTS
STREAKED AWAY, FLIPPING BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL FLAT POSITION, THEY AGAIN
LINED UP IN ECHELON THEIR GLOW BRIGHTENING SWIFTLY AS IF FROM AN INCREASE IN
POWER.
A SECOND AFTER THIS, TWO OTHER DISC-SHAPED OBJECTS RACED UNDER THE DC-4 AND
JOINED THE SIX AHEAD. IN THE TWO OR THREE SECONDS IT TOOK TO CATCH UP, THESE
TWO SEEMED TO GLOW THE BRIGHTEST OF ALL.
SUDDENLY ALL THE OBJECTS WENT DARK. WHEN THEIR GLOW REAPPEARED, THE PILOTS
SAW THAT ALL EIGHT OBJECTS WERE NOW IN LINE, HEADING WEST, THEY CLIMBED TO A
HIGH ALTITUDE AND QUICKLY VANISHED IN THE NIGHT.
AFTER RADIOING THE NORFOLK TOWER, [REDACTED] ESTIMATED THE
OBJECTS' SPEED WITH A DALTON MARK 7 COMPUTER. THE DISTANCE COVERED, FROM THE
FIRST SIGHTING TO THE POINT OF DISAPPEARANCE, WAS ABOUT 50 MILES. THE STRANGE
OBJECTS HAD TRAVELED THIS DISTANCE IN NOT OVER 15 SECONDS, OR AT A SPEED OF
200 MILES A MINUTE.

UFO SIGHTING
CHESAPEAKE BAY, VIRGINIA
14 July 1952

A DC-4-type aircraft, piloted by 2 airline pilots, was approaching Norfolk, Virginia, 14 July 1952, about 20-25 miles out on NE leg of range at 8,000' when 6 unidentified objects were first sighted approaching a/c on heading about 60 deg at approximately 2,000'.

When objects reached point under & slightly to right of a/c, one of the observers saw them roll up on edge and instantly shoot off on heading 270 deg. After change of direction, two more objects appeared from behind and joined formation. Speed of discs was estimated at well over 1,000 mph. When first seen, they were glowing on top side, with intense amber-red light. Diameter was approximately 100' (estimated) and they appeared perfectly circular. They approached DC-4 in narrow echelon and appeared to decelerate before changing direction. With deceleration, dimming of glow was noted; immediately after changing direction and flattening out, glow disappeared entirely. They reappeared at once, glowing brilliantly again, and began climbing on heading of 270 deg. Their glow was extinguished again, this time in sequence rather than simultaneously, and they were lost from view. Sighting occurred at 2012 EST on 14 July 1952. Total duration of sighting was 15 seconds.

Air Force Comments: Five jet a/c were in the vicinity of Langley AFB at the time of observation. After various checks surrounding AF agencies, it was concluded that objects were not the 5 jet a/c. Other checks for known airborne objects were made with negative results.

Air Force Conclusion: Unidentified.

The [redacted] sighting is one of the so called "classics." This sighting has been included in the books of Edward J. Ruppelt, THE REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS; Keyhoe, FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER SPACE, Holt; and Donald H. Menzel and Lyle G. Boyd, THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS, Doubleday.

The first paragraph in the left column appears to start with "...in Washington today, 150 to 20 miles..." but much of the text is too faint or blurry to read with complete certainty. The document appears to be a typed report with significant portions that are difficult to make out due to the image quality.

JULY 14, 1952 NORFOLK, VIRGINIA (WP AF5 FILES)                2 WITNESSES

FIRST PILOT                     CO-PILOT                     ON A PAA* C1

DC-4, WERE EN ROUTE FROM NEW YORK CITY TO MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND

OBSERVED SIX UNUSUAL OBJECTS. THEY WERE FLYING AT 8000 FEET, WITH A TRUE

HEADING OF 200 DEGREES AND WERE APPROXIMATELY 24 MILES FROM NORFOLK WHEN

OBSERVED THE SIX UNCONVENTIONAL OBJECTS APPROXIMATELY TEN MILES DISTANT IN

ECHELON FORMATION.

EACH OBJECT WAS EMITTING A BRILLIANT REDDISH AMBER GLOW AND ALL WERE

PROGRESSING ON A HEADING OF 60 DEGREES, DIRECTLY TOWARD THE PAA DC-4. THE

ALTITUDE OF THESE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE 2000 FEET.

                CALLED                     ATTENTION TO THE OBJECTS AND BOTH OBSERVED THE

OBJECTS COMING IN THEIR DIRECTION.     LOST SIGHT OF THEM WHEN THEY WENT

BELOW THE GLARE SHIELD ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE. HE IMMEDIATELY RELEASED HIS

SAFETY BELT AND CROSSED OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE COCKPIT, BEHIND

                    WHO WAS ABLE TO OBSERVED THESE OBJECTS CONTINUOUSLY.

RECALLED THAT JUST PRIOR TO THE TIME THE OBJECTS WERE BELOW

THE DC-4, THE FRONT ECHELON SEEMED TO BE DECELERATING BECAUSE IT APPEARED THAT

AF FORM 112-PART II                                                 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. The DC-4 piloted by [redacted] was approaching Norfolk, Virginia, about six minutes (20-25 miles) out on the NR 23, at 1600, when, on a clear day, when six amateurs were first spotted over Hampton Roads or the city of Newport News, approaching the aircraft on a heading of about 500, at about 2,000 feet. When they reached a point under and slightly to the right of the DC-4, in an arc, instantly shoot off on a heading of 270°, rolling back to a flat position. This change of direction was made with the suddenness of a knife cutting a stone wall and was not a turn in the sense that conventional aircraft make a turn. Immediately after the change of direction two more of the discs appeared from behind and to the right of the DC-4 and joined the formation.

2. The speed of this disc was estimated at well over 1,000 mph. When first seen, they were glowing, on the top side with an intense amber-red light more brilliant than the lights of the cities below, and resembling a glowing red-hot coal. Their diameter was approximately 100 ft. (estimated) and they appeared perfectly circular. They approached the DC-4 in a burst of speed, almost in trail, and appeared to decelerate just before changing direction with the deceleration was noted at a climbing or level attitude, and immediately after changing direction and flattening out, the glow diminished entirely. They reappeared at once, slowing brilliantly again, and began climbing on a heading of 270°. Their glow was extinguished again, this time in sequence rather than simultaneously, and they were lost to view.

3. The following impressions were received by [redacted] and [redacted] and are of interest:

a. The maneuvers were in a controlled formation, and during deceleration prior to the change of direction they did not scatter. Particularly, but some altitude overran the leader. After the turn they were again in good formation.

b. The glow or light on the top surface was related to the power source, since in deceleration the light dimmed, and apparently brightened when power was again applied.

c. Thickness of the objects was estimated at ten to fifteen feet by flash and not enough to accommodate a man standing erect.

d. The objects did not respond to natural laws, and appeared weightless without turning or coming to a stop.

e. No physical characteristics were noticeable except as already mentioned. The light on top of the surface was internal and not projected. Since it was not reflected off the DC-4.

f. The light did not pulse but was steady, and the objects were sharp-edged as if by rheostats, or reduction of power. They were climbing, then climbing as if by rheostats, or reduction of power. They also went completely off instantly and instantly reappeared.

r. The objects are definitely not of earthly origin.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. The observers are considered reliable, and evidently saw just what they described. The objects were in view for at least five seconds, possibly ten seconds, since then, then appearing, not out of the left passage, and to the other side of the cockpit and picked them up again as they completed their turn and watched then disappear.

2. Assuming that they were in view ten miles before the turn and ten miles after the turn and then second elapsed period in this period, the distance covered was twenty miles in ten seconds, a speed fantastic to contemplate.

2100 hours while sitting in his automobile at an outdoor theater north of Nouasseur
Air Base near Casablanca, Casa., the witness sighted an object in the sky that
appeared to be on fire. Object was moving from south to north and appeared to be
over runways at Nouasseur. The altitude of the flying object was approximately
500 feet and moving in level flight. It took approximately 7 seconds to pass
across 90 degrees of horizon. General outline not clearly seen. Plane from object
appeared as a tear drop in shape and light was at median intensity. The color of
the flame was light red. Trailing behind object were several smaller dots of flame
that appeared to be continuing from main body and turning behind wing. Flame was
changing direction, altitude, or appearance. Flame was not of the blue-white
variety of a shooting star. Object did not resemble a falling meteor either in
speed, color or direction of flight.

CASE #11

15 July 1952                                                Norfolk, Virginia

A DC-4 type a/c, piloted by 2 airline pilots, was approaching Norfolk, Virginia, about 20-25 miles out on the NE leg of the range, at 8,000' when 6 unidentified objects were first sighted approaching a/c on a heading of about 60 deg at approximate 2,000'.

When the objects reached a point under & slightly 200 to the right of the a/c, one of the observers saw them roll up on edge and, not make a turn in an arc, instantly shoot off on a heading of 270 deg, rolling back to a flat position. This change of direction was made with the suddenness of a bullet or ricocheting off a stone wall after the first change of direction two more of the objects appeared from behind and to the right of the DC-4 and joined formation at 201°.

The speed of the discs was estimated at well over 1,000 mph. When first seen, they were glowing on the top side with an intense amber-red light, and resembling a glowing red hot coal. Their diameter was approximately 100' (estimated) and they appeared to be perfectly circular. They approached the DC-4 in a narrow echelon formation, almost in trail, and appeared to decelerate just before changing direction. With the deceleration a dimming of their intense glow was noted, and immediately after changing direction and flattening out, the glow disappeared entirely. They reappeared at once, glowing brilliantly again, and began climbing on a heading of 270 deg. Their glow was extinguished again, this time in sequence rather than simultaneously, and they were lost from view.

ATIC Comments: Five Jet a/c were in the vicinity of Langley AFB at the time of observation. After various checks with surrounding AF agencies, it was concluded that objects were not the 5 Jet a/c. Other checks for known airborne objects were made with negative results. Sighting occurred at 2012 EST on 14 July 1952 for a period of 15 seconds.

Conclusion:
Unknown

4. In accordance with MCSR Letter No. 99 dated 23 October 1950 and Letter Department's of the Air Force, Headquarters, United States Air Force, Washington 25, D. C., entitled "Report of Unidentified Flying Objects", dated 8 September 1950, following information was obtained through interview and is set forth:

Shape: Definitely circular in shape and very flat.

Size: Estimate approximately 100 feet in diameter. Determined by use of patch, diameter of objects approximately one and one-half inches on pencil at arm's length. Believe distance of objects at closest proximity to 2 km. American aircraft at 6000 feet. Also, estimated size of unconventional aircraft in relation to city and surrounding area.

Color: Whole top surface appeared to be a hot coal, with steamy glow of light, a little more color than a cheap tail light. For more brilliant glow than the lights of Norfolk and Newport News, Virginia. Glow was extinguished directly after turn. Glow reappeared approximately 6 miles out and was again extinguished a few seconds later.

Number: Six unconventional aircraft in original formation and two additional unconventional aircraft joined on original flight. Original flight in general formation in 2 flights of 3 or a formation of 6, with the first 3 stacked up as if they were accelerating or decelerating. Entire flight appeared to fly like a group of fighter.

Aerodynamic Features: When observed on turn, appeared very thin in flight, no exhaust, planes or trails observed, no navigation lights or running lights observed. Only reddish rather brilliant glow from top surface.

Propulsion System: Objects appeared to have no weight, accelerated and then changed nearly instantaneously. Mach correction of 1-20 degrees instantaneously and no slip or sliding observed. Optical co-pilot -- Degree of glow from objects is directly proportionate to rate of acceleration. Also, side of glow controlled direction and speed of aircraft.

This following information was furnished this headquarters by the Commanding
Officer, 1815th AACS Group, Nouasseur, French Morocco in his SMLS, dated 15 July
1952, and is the text of an article which appeared in the "Atlantic Courier" on
12 July 1952.

"Flying Saucers" have been seen in the Casablanca sky, and their flight over
the city was witnessed by several people including Mr. Bud Krueger, the TAA representative here. The following is a statement by Bud Krueger:

The conversation was general and we were all enjoying the cool, cool breeze
on the roof terrace at the Kay Club last night when all of a sudden Bunny Lewis
said "Look up there, is that an airplane?"

With that, Ed Lewis (Bunny's husband), O. O. Giffin, Mrs. Vi Knoll, her
husband and daughter, Harry Handcock and his wife Martha and myself, looked up
in the sky. Coming from the north, traversing the sky very rapidly, was a
formation of what looked like four ghostly shapes.

The formation appeared to be the same type used in military air maneuvers
with one "thing" in the lead, one on either side and one trailing.

When we first saw them, they were about "one o'clock" and moved across the
sky with great speed. They seemed to be flying at a constant speed. We lost sight
of them as they came into the illuminated area of the moon.

Had one or two people seen them it could have been considered an optical
illusion, but when as many as nine people saw them, it could hardly be considered
as such. No known that they could not have been the light of an aircraft, as most
commercial and private aircraft have blinking light. These objects were completely
illuminated with a neon type glow. Also another was a sensation of sound, which
would also rule out the possibility of it being a known type of aircraft.

Most everyone had a different version of what the shape of the objects were.
Some of them thought they looked like pillows, others thought they looked diamond
shaped, and still others thought they looked like "Flying Saucers."

Airport flying in the vicinity of Langley AFB, Virginia, at the
time of the sighting of the unconventional aircraft.

5. The following impressions were received by [REDACTED] and
during the course of the observation of the unconventional type aircraft:

a. The saucers were in a controlled formation, and during deceleration
prior to the change of direction, they did not hold perfect
formation, but some almost overstran the leader. After the turn they
moved again in good formation.

b. The glow or light on the top surface was related to the power
source, since in deceleration the light dimmed, and apparently
brightened when power was again applied.

c. Thickness of the objects was estimated at ten to fifteen feet
by hatch and at not enough to accommodate a man standing erect,
by Fort-Newberry.

d. The objects did not respond to natural laws, and appeared
weightless. They were not affected by gravity or momentum since
they changed direction 150 degrees without thinking or coming to
a stop.

e. No physical characteristics were noticeable except as already
mentioned. The light on top of the saucers was internal and not
projected, since it was not reflected off the body.

DETAILS: (Cont'd)

1. The Light did not pulse but was steady, and the objects were sharp, outlined. There was no corona or hazy radiology surrounding them. The timing was as if by chance, or reaction of power.  They also went completely off instant, and lastly responsive.

2. The objects are definitely not of earthly origin.

3. One (1) copy only of overlay of WDO 357 concerning sighting location is attached to reports of Headquarters OSY, Contracting General, A.G. OSH District Office No. 21 and OSH District Office No. 76.

Dear Tom,

Regarding the modification made by Mr. [redacted] on your publication.
I have thoroughly checked the case file and I cannot agree to
the changes. I really don't care whether you use the modifica-
tions or not. Thus up to you. My only reason for not agreeing
to the changes is that the case is a classic and many authors
have written many words about this particular case. I'd like
to point out a number of things about the modifications.

1. The word "sequence" is the exact word used by [redacted] in
his hand written statement.

2. "Sequence" is one thing, "irregular order" is another
and they don't have the same meaning.

3. The case file states that the object was estimated to
be 100 feet by using a pencil.

4. I can find no place in the record where it states that
other persons observed the objects.

5. The weather as stated in your article is the weather
that's stated in the record. I can find no statement that says
visibility was "unlimited".

I'm sorry that I can't agree to your proposal Tom, but I have
to be fair to the people who have had previous access to the case
file.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

July 8, 1953

Lt. Anderson G. Flues,
Asst. Army Project Bluebook Officer,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Lt. Flues:

I am one of the two an American World Airways pilots who watched eight red-orange lights maneuver below a DC4 near Norfolk V.A. last July 14.(1953)

A complete report of this sighting was given to an Army Major and three "special Investigators, U.S. Air Force" in a two hour session which, the other pilot and I spent it in the morning after the sighting. I have never received any information regarding the manner in which this sighting was obtained, and would appreciate any news you can give me regarding this.

Since this experience which was so vivid, I have maintained considerable interest in other reports of these phenomena. Undoubtedly, Project Bluebook is the best informed source of information regarding these sightings and the results of thorough investigations. I have heard that you have some information which is available for interested people at their respective bases or other points. I could not sincerely be grateful for anything which you can send me to help assuage my curiosity.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Yours Very truly,
[Signature redacted]
Lt., USNR

HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY
CAMBRIDGE 38, MASSACHUSETTS

January 4, 1952

[Redacted name]
Key Biscayne
Miami 41, Florida

Dear Capt. [Redacted]:

I am really very appreciative of your thoughtful letter of January 12. I am sincerely trying to get to the root of these sightings. And, though I originally had doubts and still do in special cases, I have none whatever concerning the sincerity of the majority of members of NICAP, including yourself, Dr. [Redacted], and others. Perhaps you will be good enough to let me explain my position, which I think is that of the average scientist as well as the present position of the Air Force, so that we may understand one another better.

I suppose that I cannot disabuse you of your belief that I am really not sincere. You are not the first person to imply that I am simply a "stooge," cooperating with the Air Force in an endeavor to suppress information about flying saucers. In this you, in common with many others, are undoubtedly to some persons has the Air Force, government officials, and many scientists are conspiring to keep secret incontrovertible evidence that flying saucers are extraterrestrial in origin. At least let me say for the record, whether you believe it or not, that I have never been an official consultant to any government agency on the subject of flying saucers. Twice on occasions I gave unclassified popular talks, once to the Navy and once to a group at Arlington Hall, Virginia. In these lectures I expressed essentially the opinion given in my book. I have had many problems and difficulties with the Air Force. I am in no sense expressing approval of their or their methods of investigation, especially those conducted under the law [Redacted]. However, the Air Forces recently opened their files to me without restrictions. At one time they had offered to do so but had tried to impose too many restrictions. A classification can mean. This I refused to do. I assume this may be the origin of the statement Keyhole quoted from CHOP in one of his earlier books that I had not taken advantage of an opportunity offered by the Air Force to inspect their data.

[Redacted Name], Capt. FAA                                                     -2-                                                     January 13, 1962

One further point, I am in no sense casting aspersions on the honesty or the competence of airline pilots. ATIC files bulge with reports from pilots, both domestic and military. They constitute beyond question the most reliable data available. ATIC takes the reports seriously and does one honest if, at times, incompetent job of evaluation. The great bulk of these reports have been solved. In your definition of the word, therefore, they are no longer UFO's. Nevertheless, no matter how experienced these pilots are, we have many examples of pilots who have buzzed mirages of stars, who have reported reflections from ice crystals, balloons and many other natural and terrestrial phenomena. There is no question concerning the proper identification. The reports are completely clear. And again I say that this does not cast doubts on the competence of the pilot or his integrity. But, when we have so much evidence that pilots will every bit as much appreciate as you have made and can make errors of evaluation of what they have seen, I think I have every right to question your interpretation-not the observation itself.

Let me put this another way. If a six-year old boy comes to me and tells me that he has seen a dog or a cat out in the yard, I have no thought of questioning him. If he tells me that he has seen a cow, I may be a little skeptical because even the Hollis professor at Harvard University who used to have the right to lecture his cow in the Harvard yard, no longer keeps one. I checked and find that perhaps he actually did see a cow. A farmer carrying a cow in a trailer was in an auto accident outside. The trailer broke loose and crashed, releasing the cow, which wandered into the yard. Not an impossible explanation at all but a rather rare combination of circumstances.

If the boy reports that he has seen a lion in the yard, I am still more skeptical. First of all I will demand greater proof. However, I do not immediately rush out and notify the police that a lion is loose. I may check the papers to see if the circus was in town, considering that a circus wagon might also have met with an accident, releasing a lion. In any event, it is much more probable that the child has seen an unusually large yellow dog or cat and mistaken it for a lion. Or perhaps it is just one of those large, toy stuffed lions left on the lawn by a neighbor's child.

Now, and finally (thank goodness), suppose that the boy reports that he has seen a green lion out on the lawn. I have to reassure myself concerning the integrity. Perhaps he is simply playing a joke, teasing me. In brief, he would fall in the "hoaxer" class. But if I am satisfied that he must have seen something, I look around for other explanations. I don't suppose that two-headed lions are a downright impossibility. I have seen several two-headed cats in my lifetime, mostly

preserved in a bottle filled with formaldehyde and exhibited in a glass house.
They may have been fakes but they looked impressive. Usually nature
takes care of such freaks by killing them off at an early age. But I would
regard--and I think you would too--the report as registering some further
degree of astonishment. Incidentally, casually, would prove that
the boy, looking out through a double storm window, had actually seen a
double reflection of a green pillow in the room behind him, the pillow
crumpled so that it happened to resemble a lion. Or it may be that a
large dog, had nevertheless knocked into a table at some point
spilled on him, and that he was standing, at the moment sighted, beside a
large pane of plate glass scheduled to be put in a broken window.

Now, sometimes careful investigation can disclose all of
the factors involved. However, it is not always possible to duplicate the
exact condition. The green dog may have just been passing through the
neighborhood and, for some reason, was never seen again. Of course,
if others report a green dog, one would have a tendency to want
to substantiate the boy's story. But if I can come up with a reasonable
explanation or even a possible explanation that is far more probable than
that of the green, two-headed lion, I do not have to apologize for involving
I do not even claim that I have distorted the facts. The boy is quite certain
as to what he saw. Even my inability to reconstruct what actually happened
does not in itself prove that a green, two-headed lion was roaming around.

Thus, Capt. _____ is precisely the dilemma that faces the
scientist today. And, for the record, let me state that, in my opinion, a
real, live, green, two-headed lion is far more probable an object than the
interplanetary UFO's that you and the NICAP group want us to accept. The
report, if any, has on your part no prove that no other explanation is
possible. The mere fact that you or others cite that other objects have
been seen in the neighborhood about the same time does not prove that the
objects sighted are what you claim them to be.

You refer to a TV program on which I was supposed to
appear and did not. You imply that I am afraid to face you or other air-
line pilots. Nonsense! I cannot recall the incident at all.

One more thing, Capt. _____. You say that I am "parsing my
theories." They are more than theories. When I wrote my book on Flying
saucers I had to use theories, largely, because I did not have access to this
ATIC file. However, as a physicist and as an expert in radio propagation,
as a naval officer in charge of many aspects of radio communication and
radar, and as an expert in meteorological optics I could show that reports
similar to those made by the airline pilots have been made for many years.

[Redacted], Capt. PAA                                                January 18, 1962

The nature of many of the phenomena have been known for many years. When I have discussed these with many pilots, both civilian and military, I find that they are completely unaware of the ability of a bright star near the horizon to appear to maneuver. The Air Force was aware of this. The Air Force scientific advisor was aware of this. But it has since been definitely demonstrated and proved that this can happen under certain conditions of temperature inversions. I am not saying that what you saw resulted in a temperature inversion, but I am saying, however, that I have more than theory to go on.

Let us return to another point. Of course I do not know what you actually reported to ATIC. All I have to go on is their fairly lengthy and detailed report. I recall the transcribing difficulties may arise from time to inadequacy of transcription. I have myself been frustrated from time to time by a gap in the ATIC reports, some of them resulting from inadequate questioning. For example, what they may question is the UFO. This is being asked of the UP. They may refer to the description of the UFO as seen by the observer. If it may refer to the observer's estimate of the course of the UFO. These are two quite different things.

Be that as it may, I welcome the opportunity to ask you a few more specific questions. Perhaps I am not quite as naive as you suspect. I had even gone to the length of getting a photograph of the side of a cockpit in a DC6, in order to judge the configuration of the windows.

Charge
Here is a point of disagreement. I agree that you can estimate angular size and angular speed. This is equivalent to your statement that they would approximate the size (angular) of a DC6 at 2,000 feet. This means that they were a little more than a quarter of a degree in diameter, something less than half the diameter of the full moon.

Now, if you know the distance, you can get the true size. Or, if you know the true size, you can get the distance. Date-wise this is, to the point that I tried to make a previous note - we can possibly determine the distance of an object of unknown size if it lies beyond approximately 30 feet. With a single eye you can't do anywhere nearly as well. Try closing one eye, partially like your arm, and try to bring a little finger of one hand against the pointer finger of the other. Ability to judge distance depends upon binocular vision. The distance between two eyes is two and one-half inches. At 30 feet, the two eyes subtend an angle of approximately one fortieth of a degree. In fact, most people cannot judge distances accurately, beyond 150 ft.

Of course, as I look up the street, the situation is much different. I can see that automobiles are more than one building at the corner, which is probably too fast a way. To the fact that I subconsciously make allowance for size of an automobile, and part of it is due to the fact that I can see the object between me and the more-distant corner.

Things are different, on the other hand, in the air. Against either the sky or the ground, tests have clearly shown that it is indeed impossible for anyone--not even you, sir--to make accurate estimates. And when you stare that a pilot could judge something between an unfamiliar something that is halfway between his plane with the ground, you are talking absolute nonsense. And I don't care how experienced a pilot you are. I do not mean this unkindly or critically. This is just a well-known statement of scientific fact. I know objects, yes. I or other scientists can estimate from the angular movement now yet a (illegible word), no. Is darkness or semi-darkness the ability to judge it even less.

Now, let me make a second observation--observation that your comments about the visibility of visibility, through the several different windows of the cockpit, including the curved section, may possibly--though not necessarily--destroy my reflection theory. However, by raising this point, I obtained an important and significant additional bit of information. This should have been my original point. That is not your fault, as such, as that of the Air Force, for failing to ask the proper kinds of questions. Only recently has the Air Force gotten around to asking the right questions under different types of circumstances.

In unusual type of reflection could have been required, to account for this type of instantaneous several-like a ricochets--strongly suggests the reflection hypothesis. For only a reflection is not responsible to the laws of physics such as inertia. Now I realize that the flying saucer believers have tried to promote the idea that, somehow or other, mysterious and very advanced scientists have found a way of making themselves immune to acceleration of 500 or 1,000 G's. This is something I don't believe. The reflection, I would conclude, if it was a reflection, was of some illuminated object outside of the plane. Therefore, it could not have moved in the way it did.

I accept your correction about the eastern horizon. There may have been some obscuring clouds that might not be critically visible. If you find me frustrating to deal with, it is certainly not because I am willing to credit observers other than scientists with sense. I am merely trying to find out some of the basic details that did not appear in the report.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

Directorate of Intelligence    5-317-52

The following is the edited teletype message received 23 July 1952 from Major W. Mac Sparran, Wing Provost Marshal, 80th Air Depot Wing.

An unidentified flying object was sighted at Nouasseur Air Base 2125 hours 13 July 1952. Leland H. O'Neal, Atlas Constructors employee, driving south on road parallel to eastern boundary of base airfield object, which first appeared to be a jet with afterburner at 1000 feet, compass heading south by southeast. Object now extremely bright and appeared to be an elliptical body of luminous white with pale red flaming trail. Object observed 30 to 40 seconds. Object suddenly blacked out in flight and disappeared. Object gave off no sound. During period of observation. Line of flight was horizontal and with no deviation in course.

Rafael Gil Sanchez, Spanish national, USAF local hired employee, sighted object from Base Power Plant 1 mile west of O'Neal's position. Sanchez's story substantiates O'Neal's on all points. Sanchez further stated that object was first narrow and bright, but gradually dimmed and expanded, then abruptly disappeared.

Second unidentified flying object was sighted at Nouasseur Air Base 2237 hours, 13 July 52. Object sighted by at least seven airmen and several officers from three points on the base. All reported observing, for 5 to 10 seconds, a round, bright, bluish-white object which flew in an arc over flight line and runway and vanished over horizon. All personnel interviewed stated emphatically that object was not shooting star, flare, or weather balloon. Object descended toward west at high rate of speed.

The following reports were given to the Preparing Officer at Nouasseur Air Force Base 25 July 1952.

Capt Ira E. Vance, AO 312132, Purchasing and Contracting Officer, 80th Air Depot Wing, driving from Boulhaut to Casablanca-13 July 1952 sighted unidentified flying object at approximately 2145 hours. Object appeared southwest in the direction of Casablanca. Visibility was good. Object resembled a meteor, however, it was larger than any meteor observed in his experiences. Object was low on the horizon and closer to earth than meteor. Object resembled a large ball of flame which remained bright during its flight and then suddenly disappeared. It was observed for only a few seconds. No sound was audible to the observer and no electronic interference was noted. Capt Vance did not report this sighting until approached on the subject by the preparing officer because he was convinced it was a meteor.

Capt Ira E. Vance, 1st Coord. Transportation Officer, 80th Air Depot Wing, Mrs. Evelyn Bell, and Mrs. E. Carlene Vance also occupants of the automobile driven by Capt Vance had an opportunity to observe simultaneous object for approximately 20 seconds. Their respective statements substantiate the Preparing Officer's report except that they described the object as a long airplane with bright lights. Capt Vance again stated object was a meteor. Light appeared along the cabin lights of C-47 or C-64 aircraft. Object suddenly disappeared in 1-2 seconds.

Capt Maro G. Bliss, AO 160227, Chief, Aerial Activities and Miscellaneous Repair Station, 80th Air Depot Wing, sighted aerial object 13 July 1952 at approximately 2145 hours.

either the ATIC files or in your TRUE article, (at this moment I do
not have either of them here in my office, while I am dictating, and
some of the questions I am about to ask you may be redundant.) But
it was never clear to me, until now, although perhaps it should have
been, that you saw the objects out of the right window. I do not agree
with you, however, that you should have been relying from the near-by
city of checking on reflections. You should have at least mentioned
some of these basic data. These are frustrating facts that we who
attempt to evaluate the sightings have to go through. Much of the
really valuable data has been lost and irretrievable. But let me say this
in your somewhat agitated protestation that "we know damned well
that the brilliant objects we saw were none of your reflections." Rec-
ollections, per se, cannot be distinguished from real objects. They
look alike, move alike, and have the basic characteristics of real objects
except where there is a change of aspect between the object itself and
the mirror or reflecting glass. In brilliant daylight, of course, where
you see a reflection, it is likely to have a hazy, transparent quality.
But at night this is not true. I think you need to elaborate further as
to why this could not have been a reflection from some bright object
or objects on the left-side of the plane. Also, I have been trying to
find out one further point and thus far have had no direct answer.
Although I have a photograph of the cockpit of a LCG, I am not sure
whether the side windows were vertical or not. I have the impression
that they are all inclined, so that the lower edge is farther from the
center of the cockpit than the upper.

I have already taken much too long on this letter, but,
you see, I am trying to be honest and direct. Will you please give me
again, if you will, the bearing of your craft at the time of the sighting
and its ground and air speed. Will you please indicate the bearing on
which you first saw these objects and the angular altitude below or
above the horizon. Will you please indicate which window you saw
these from initially. Will you please indicate which window you were
looking through when you saw them apparently reverse. Will you then
indicate what window you saw them disappear from, and whose you
were standing in the cockpit. Will you indicate the bearing on which
they disappeared. Will you tell me whether these appeared to get
bigger and bigger as they came in and smaller and smaller as they
disappeared. You have placed a great deal on their flipping on edge
but I am still not quite clear as to what happened at the end of the
flight, or the beginning.

I should like to have an objective statement from you,
since you emphasize this point, "If you tell me if you were a be-
liever in flying saucers from outer space prior to this sighting? At
what time did you change your opinion if you were not? Were you
actually looking for flying saucers and discussing them with
shortly before you made your observation? Does

Capt. FAA                                                January 15, 1962

agree with your conclusion that these sightings were of interplanetary
craft?

I am further aware of the fact that a few people in the
Air Force, notably --------who has admitted to me that he was not
in a position himself to evaluate the sightings---said some derogatory
things concerning my book, "So did --------". But that is not the point.
But that is not the reason why. It is because of his --------of the whole UFO business.

The reason why we still have the dregs of unsolved
cases is due to the bad questioning of the pilots by irresponsible
groups at ATC at the height of the visitation. This is evidence
of the incompetence of the group at that time. But the group now
in charge at ATC are doing a really good job. And one
by one, to some extent with my help, the classic cases are being
resolved. You, perhaps like myself, are somewhat committed.
You have made public statements, as have I. I claim that my mind
is much more open than yours or anyone from NICAP that I have
heard from to date.

You desire UFO, as I indicated, in a rather special way,
so that an object is no longer a UFO such as is an unknown. But I
have seen UFO after UFO--some the old classics--and some that
might well have become classics, some that resemble closely the un-
solved classics where basic data are missing, many of them reported
by reliable airline pilots, civilians, commercial, and military. I do
not believe in the infallibility of the airline pilot. I have seen too
many reports where an airline pilot has pulled his plane up to try to
avoid a meteor that actually was 200 miles away from him at the time.
I think that the trouble with the NICAP viewpoint is the influence that
Keyhoe and his books have wielded on their minds. Certainly Keyhoe
will never settle for anything less than completely censoring the Air
Force and receiving from them acknowledgment that his position,
which he has slowly maintained from the start, that flying saucers
are from outer space. You notice that I used the words "flying
saucers from outer space" rather than UFOs. I frankly prefer the
NICAP term "aerial phenomena," which does not beg the question.
UFO implies the existence of a material object. In many cases, as
we have demonstrated clearly, no material object is involved, at
least any nearby material object. A mirage of Venus, Jupiter, or
Sirius actually results from light originating in a material object far
away. But it does not mean that the object is within our own atmos-
phere, as the adjective "flying" implies. In fact, this particular

definition implies the time that Ruppelt had toward the flying maneuvers from space and the interplanetary solution, when he coined it. It also shows that, despite some disclaimers to the contrary, that he and his group were not aware of the major reflection hypothesis that I have proposed.

I am sending copies of this letter to [redacted], and [redacted], whom I have come to respect, even though I do not agree with their views. [redacted] himself has indicated that these cannot be handled on a scientific basis. I think that a certain amount of "will to believe" is involved. However, I do not believe—shall we say—that there is any para-human or really intelligent life in our solar system. I do subscribe to the view that there may be intelligent life in many places in the Universe. But, as an astronomer, I am aware—more aware than most—of the vastness of space.

The amount of fuel that would be required, the amount of effort that would be necessary, if true interplanetary exploration, from stars other than our sun were to come about. Now don't just say, "There is a man who is limited in his present-day knowledge. There have been many great inventions and perhaps someone will find a way of getting around these difficulties." I am aware of all of these possibilities and still feel that, no matter how intelligent or advanced a race may be, they are not likely to be visiting around the earth. And remember that you are arguing that the visitations consist of thousands of cases, and yet no evidence—I hope you do not subscribe to the reliability of the witnesses—that a single one has actually landed.

Please believe me, Capt. [redacted] that I am writing this long letter without rancor, despite the obvious angry flashes in your own letter. My opinion of flying pilots has perhaps gone up above the result of these sightings, and I certainly fly enough, for someone who does not hold a pilot's license. I can fly a plane and have flown a plane on many occasions, with proper supervision, of course. Most of my flying is completed with PAA Flight 75, about 75,000 miles a year, which is small compared with what a pilot covers. But I do manage to keep my eyes open. I have spent many hours in the pilot's cabin. I have seen flying maneuvers that matched many of the classic cases. I have resolved what they were. I have based my resolution on my scientific knowledge. There is no question about the correctness of my observations and the Air Force has accepted them absolutely. I say this to show that I am not just an arm-chair theorist.

I am tentatively scheduled to fly PAA from Mexico City to Caracas on March 18, returning to New York on March 24. If I should have the good fortune to have you as my pilot, I will fly with complete confidence and hope that we might have a chance to talk. I, for one, would welcome the opportunity.

Key Biscayne,
Miami 49, Florida,
February 8, 1952

Doctor Donald E. Menzel,
Director,
Harvard College Observatory,
Cambridge 38, Massachusetts.

Dear Doctor Menzel:

Please forgive the time element between your last letter
and this answer. I have been flying shortly. In addition, as I mentioned
before, flying is not my only current responsibility.

Thank you for taking the time from your own busy schedule
to write a nine page letter.

I have a great respect for your intelligence and your outstanding work in various fields. Therefore I believe that this popular work cannot do you much good. You know too much to be a good Doctor Menzel and me without good reason. In spite of your denials, I think myself sufficient evidence might in your own recent letters
to actually indicate that you know more than you are now telling. To help this, I did of the "unexplainables" before the Congressional hearings
last year. To following, I took directly from your letters, and is strongly
in line with this, that, even if never before, adding the Air Force
is its mounting campaign.

1. Your present access to all A.F. files.

2. Your demoting of Project Bluebook (They didn't agree
with you, so your didn't like this plan. Your praise of the Air Force
probably because they, in stepping at straws rather desperately, have
come to you for help.

3. Your casual inquiry in a letter to Dr. Maney - "By the
way, how are the plans for the Congressional hearing progressing?"

4. You explain your position as that of the position of the
Air Force.

5. Your definite statement that the A.F. did not silence
Capt. [redacted]. How could you know if not closely associated with the
A.F.? You said, "I can say unequivocally that they (A.F.) did nothing
of the sort." [redacted]

6. You say, "and one by one, to some extent with my colleagues" classic cases are being resolved.

You claim that you have never been an official consultant
of the government on U.F.O.'s. That could be devious sophistry. You have
served with the government in other fields, no doubt in an official
capacity. This U.F.O. business could be a little extra job you may tossed
in - [redacted]

It is not necessary, as you claim it to be, that the government, through its medical investigating departments on the subject,
is "investigating to keep secret or cover up." There is a percentage of U.F.O.

The text seems to be part of a longer conversation or report, with discussions about the credibility of UFO sightings and investigations. Some words are slightly blurry but mostly readable.]

Would you like me to transcribe the full text of the document?


- page 67 -

I am sworn that you are an expert in many fields of physics, and I do not tell all aspects of your ability, but I do feel that one must stretch things quite a bit to agree with some of your explanations. The original observer has had the distinct advantage of being there, and even with your ability is in a worse position of being a "Monday morning quarterback".

The burden of proof is on you, Doctor Menzel, if you want to disprove, and how many times have you "overwhelmed" critics and yourself with a real documented case of a sighting was without actual, reflections, sun-dogs, mirages or hot air layers over the Pentagon?

In my records, I note that book reviewer of the Buffalo Evening News, 3/9/63 said of your book.

Published in a national magazine, during an interview, said about your book.

An Air Force case, in briefing a Reserve Air Officer on 1/9/64 said of your book.

My records show that a Project Bluebook spokesman, when questioned about your research, these explanations were known to the project and generally considered, gave before Menzel published his notes. They said, "We have no comment on the request of A.T.I.C., prominent scientists analyzed these claims. Most of them accepted his answers."

A.T.I.C. said about one of your explanations:- "The clouds or mirages of meteorological phenomena is out of the question as the facts are in the record, and both would occur simultaneously in the same place."

In your long explanation of how you interpret that which someone else saw, thank you for converting us all to six year old boys while nullifying yourself the luxury of restraining your own identity.

Regarding your credulity, suppose, just before the fairly recent seizure of the Godforsaken Rift Africa, a man of intelligence stated that a trip to Abyssinia had revealed that the entire who control it were hungry and etc. But he couldn't get it from then because they had big swarms. I point out that you would even have predated such a story as long thought to be extinct.

Regarding the television program on which you did not appear, I was contacted in Miami by Frank Keefe and asked to appear, with Major Keyhoe, opposite you and Willy Ley. When I arrived in Washington, Major Keyhoe advised me that you had decided not to take part, and decided not to take part.

that Kenneth Keating, Science Editor of Time Magazine was taking your place.

I have letters in my possession from Capitol Building, noting that he had invited you more than once to meet with him on the U.F.O. subject on television or radio. With you "missing", George Smith, with a very suspicious background until he looked deeper into the subject, he will briefly summarized by your book. As the man said, it is well written.

You refer to M.I.C.A.F. as "ambushed" group. The following quotes from your letters and writings rather fully prove that you are biased:

1. "In my opinion, a good five percent two-headed lion is more probable as object than the interplanetary U.F.O.'s."

2. "U.F.O.'s" (obviously meaning all) "have different interpretations or natural phenomena" (that means in a lot of cases at present time)

3. "No - scientific investigation - is desired at this time"

4. "1952 will go and so will the years 2000 and 3000 without contacts from space people unless we ourselves go out there and bring them back to earth."

5. The above were from recent letters. In TIME magazine, June 9, 1952, you said "(flying saucers) are or real as rainbows - this anticipation is like an explaining sighting by calling it a weapon of the enemy, simply is this sort of evidence not how we judge?"

6. In BLUE BOOK Magazine in 1954, in an article titled "YOUR SOURCES ARE SUNK", you wrote, "Throughout the world, a spectator has placed the human 2000 -- and now we are seeing flying saucers!"

7. In a recent letter you also wrote, "We still have the areas of unsolved cases" (underlining mine)

It would behoove you to clean your own house before calling M.I.C.A.F.'s objective research group "biased".

It seems that you do not agree that Mr. Portenberg and I will, with our experience, estimate the size of the objects we saw. I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree on that point since you were not present during the sighting. 2000 feet will help pilots' judgment at all regarding objects in the sky between the striplines and the ground. As Air Force Officer (I believe in 1947) was quoted in the Congressional Record, "a great even in judgment does develop, and the fact that the objects were between 100 and the Earth's surface was a major reason for Air Force interest."

To not "interest" that you are right, but you seem to think that I am a stooge of the government to explain away the bothersome U.F.O.'s. This approach limits you to an incomplete, therefore unscientific, investigation.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

You are quite correct when you say "You unusual type of reflection would have to be explained" to explain our sightings. I may it would have to be an original scientific analysis, a theoretical analysis, on which you base much of the strength of your reflection theory.

I guess, in common in U.S.O. reports from ground reports, and ground observer corps, there is a tendency to say "Pushing" (why don't you say, "Here theorize"?) (You don't like to be considered to be "Pushing" your theoretical line.) I am not indicating however that this is unethically. However, I do not mean that this evidence would sustain your reflection theory. Or evidence which supports your reflection theory.

Einstein, in his unified field theory, (with which, I realize, he was not yet completely satisfied), "Gravity and electromagnetism are different manifestations of the same thing. We used as a comparison, we might say, "These are not the same thing, but they are different manifestations of the same thing.

Well, first man knew water, ice and steam in natural states. Later is learned to create steam from water. Much later, relatively speaking, we know that we could create ice from water. Presumably we knew that we could create gravity from electromagnetism. (Perhaps something that would have a slight done for the present.) We might also find that we could create gravity, air, air-over with stroll, jet with stroll, and rocket propulsion. It would be way they are so frequently special following, behind our current knowledge to learn what really is going on.

Gravity, as far as we know now, affects all material in the universe. Held everything, even a human. Gravity pulls & lets go. The force we call gravity pulls it. If a strange race has learned to create its own gravity within a space craft, and control its direction, then it is not too much to say that they could change direction without radius, create instantaneous traversals without the occupants experiencing acceleration. Imagine, for they would be veiled as the shell might be a sound building block of the universe, of which everything seems to consist - even humans. (It has been suggested by the Italian physicist Fermi Pontecorvo, who transformed the theory of Dr. Bouguer-les Chils that the basic stuff of the universe might be the neutrinos. I was that the proton-electron matter lab. is presently attempting to view this occurrence.) I don't think such a happening of those strange craft would make such violent direction changes as to be so near a discomfort, and I presently can't believe, as you don't, that they are.

Please note that I say "presently" about my beliefs. All one can do in such an uncertain subject is to remain objective, skeptical, and limiting to form fixed conclusions without discoverable evidence. I also believe that there are no "experts" on this subject. I am more convinced than those who have long been closer informed than others because of their interest in the subject.

Incidentally, while on the subject of the propulsion of the interplanetary or interstellar UFO's - if it were true that they used strong electromagnetic force to create gravitational propulsion,

It said, also be true that a by-product of the electromagnetic process might be the visible ionization of the air immediately surrounding the craft. "The UFO (flying saucer) changes of power applied (heavier masses in ionization) might among the already of it (fairly glowing in an ionized state, this could explain the apparent visual phenomenon). In one moment a mass was accomplished in laboratory, in the case, and the glasses glow brightly. As we all know, air is also a ionization of plasma.

Now a question: is it possible for a heavy layer of ionized air to move? In other words, can this moving ionized air layer be a part of a craft friction - with the other ionized air being some of the ionized air, I have just suggested, about, but not necessarily against the craft. The properties of ionized air is strongly about it.

To carry is further, photos at nighter odd easy lights, etc., and oral reports, frequently indicate a firm round leading edge, and a scattered trailing edge. One photo (I don't have it) shows a light beam (I don't have the negative) some 20 to 30 meters long - increasing bulge - like a long cargo condition. Would this suggest a gradual collapse of the air pulled by the craft? A... a real test that would be whole of ionized old, left would, could a single electromagnetic charge which would resist collapse by a...

If the craft could be almost silent, the illumination of the craft also would... (next line partially illegible) that daylight reports do not report changes in shape.

And: Doctor Marcel, reflections, nitrogen, and other such manifestations things are not the only guesses one can make to explain the 29 seconds, types, illumination, and silence of the UFO's.

Now I shall try to answer your specific questions:

2. Our compass course was 200 degrees magnetic.

Initially, I saw them from my front window, and
from than from his front window. (two distinctly dif-
ferent angles of that, misinterpreted, disorderly glass/thin
coat) now than through our window, and through the win-
dow at angles, and through at least two different panes of glass possibly there, it is also observed that
window has corner curved window is 1 dia.

8. and I were both looking through the right hand
window at the time of sighting. (In somewhat the same
with a full, complete, and continuous view.)

7. We watched them disappear as we looked through the right
side window.

8. My seat was already back a bit. (It's comfortable that
way) I was easy to step into the aisle area between the seats and
lean over to continue watching.

9. The departure track of the objects was about 30 degrees
to the right (more westerly) of their approach track.

10. At the end of the flight, they progressed our "line" and
the city areas, seemed to travel about ten miles beyond that, be-
tween wild ground, seemingly, as they climbed. They continued to
town, ending one another in an irregular fashion, as though they were
apparently sensitive to controls. In doing this, they went vertically
up, then another, vertically up, and down, then from ground up
horizontally past one another, as the initial six approached to calls
appeared to be an intelligible error - losing up the formation.)
Then from a broad and perspective diminishment, we didn't look in
a given direction, but they seemed to be horizontally quite distant.
(I added from a good and perspective diminishment) We didn't continue
to watch, but they seemed to be climbing up, in a slow fashion, in
a slowed up fashion, in no particular order. Some persons have sug-
gested they were entering a carrier - or destroyer position. How-
ever this was not so. (Incidentally, they liked our sighting, but
after the reversal, and after the some time from beneath our sight
line to join the orbital six, the lights were not about our stand-
ard. No color in quality, was not luminous, phosphorescent, or
at all fuzzy, but appeared to have sharp, or in the appearance of a
very small. They were bright red, somewhat toward orange or amber. The
size of the color-shaped objects were distinct and well-defined, not
fuzzy in the least. Artists, however, sketched for P.T. purposes,
which I am aware, and they said, "sort holes and such, but will
and I carried to appear if any such illustrations were used.

11. Yes, they appeared to get bigger and bigger as they got
closer, (considerably) and decreased in apparent size as they re-
ceded.

You demand further elaboration from me concerning my state-
ment "We know damn well that the brilliant objects as we saw con-
trol your reflections". I offer the above answers to your questions
and organize the following as evidence against the reflection theory,
which I consider very weak.

1. The apparent "intelligence error" of the objects slide-
backed one another as they approached. The objects also made the

another vertically during the climb.

2. The objects pitched off and on after reversal, and
glided at intervals, in unison, at the end of the covered
climb.

3. The unusual "not coal-like" brilliance of the objects.

4. The two additional similar discs with same from same
general area. The pilot and co-pilot stated that they were not
at first sure that what they saw was a wing, as they should have
been if they had been perfected.

5. The objects turned on edge and back flat again.

6. One pilot saw the accompanying objects through four lines
of clouds. The other saw them through two, perhaps three lines further.
(The front windshield is 7-angled with two panes.)

7. Two (at least seven) ground reports of objects similar
in area, color and maneuvers.

8. The same kind of "reflections" were seen over base, with
similar pattern around at air, and by both ground and airborne
observers. Looked on by ground radar, with converging less than
minute, one for hours at a time, within ten days after our sighting.

9. Our extended experience (far greater than yours), and that
of most other scientists, in observing and analyzing natural phenomena in all natural phenomena, and our very training in scientific
analysis.

10. The fact that the objects were observed between our airport and the base.

You ask me if I had been a believer in U.F.O.'s from available sources. I had this slightly. LIFE Magazine LIFE also asked me that, and I told them "yes". I say "yes" because of the reports from reliable sources which were then in existence.

I realize now, six years after the initial report, that to have withheld the fact of my previous interest in U.F.O.'s would have been unwise. I would have concealed some of my personal experience in all quarters, and I also am quite aware of the interest which was then growing this question.

However, I feel that truth is necessary. I also feel that one should not be too hasty in giving direct attention to this subject. We must give at least one instruction to this subject. As far as the individual has unfortunately lost one of the fundamental human values for new experiences, this human wish, as expressed by my colleagues, has been increasingly politically sensitive, and is today by the over-emphasis of another of the human values.

The capacity of this era causes many problems. We should realize that we cannot possibly foresee all reactions. We would realize that we cannot understand, possibly fathom all reactions. We cannot, should analyze with understanding, interrelate, the immensity, the humanunconsciouslynessly set in the defense technique of reaction.

"Flying for U. S. Most people watch a. these with a plea of
relief and say "Ah!" "What gets rid of those dusty old flying
saucers!" Our Air Force, in suppressing information is helping
to unite the people of our nation further into sensible security,
when what our people want is a look into the matter. I am aware
and am making of some of the guts of their forefathers.

Even if the chance that the interplanetary theory is
true was a small case, proof of the theory would be the biggest
news since A.D. 1492. Because A.D. 1492 was the subject to spread - initially Magellan's voyage around the globe. I, who spent a
part of his life in the air. The fact that I had previously taken an
interest in the subject does not help your case one bit.

No, we and I had not discussed flying saucers before the
experience we had.

No, we were not looking for flying saucers. However many
other times, I had seen them looking through lights on 3 hour over-night flights, and watched the sky intently. I saw numerous air turbulent
low-powered lights, other aircraft, bright, distorted and multi-
colored forms and various other air phenomena, but in at least
five years of such watching, I never saw anything such as appeared
to be intelligently controlled until July 20, 1952 when I was
watching. I was first time on the night of July 20, 1952, and it was a
clear night that was taking advantage of it to point out to
the various pilots and landmarks as we passed then, such as Philadelphia, Washington, and Alexandria. And the same night we were possibly looking at the same spot and saying "There is Newport News and Cumberland."

We were attracted, therefore, simultaneously, by the redness
of the objects as they seemed to light up, or appear in place, then
move like small fast circular units. When they were close, they were
so near, they came close enough for us to define their shape and to
approximate their rather large size.

To answer your question about whether or not
flying saucers existed, I will conclude that the objects were interplanetary, will cite a long article published in the MIAMI DAILY NEWS on July
13, 1952.

It was at this point that Torstenberg offered the idea that
he thought chaos "would never happen from another body in the
universe".

I currently agree with your view that the U.F.O.'s do not
originate within our solar system. In fact, I wrote an article (a feature article) in LIFE on the secret on this thesis for CHALLENGE magazine,
July, 1952. I know you are a prominent astronomer and you don't agree
with this. But I told you then, but may selectively, but people, who, of all people, should know most, including close to a few, that meteors found on Earth were interstellar - not only earthly rocks struck by lightning.

J.S.S. Haldane said, "My own suspicion is that the universe
is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose."

"Instead," said, "The fairest thing we can experience is the
fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true
science."

Hudson Maxim, in a 1910 issue of an aviation magazine commenting on aerial propulsion said, "Bombs from the high air will never be a vital offensive weapon."

Army officials with a "good grasp" of tactics thought aerial bombardment a strategic many years after the above statement was made. In 1907 you were right when you said, (not with modesty) "I give you my opinion as my particular knowledge. There is no doubt about the correctness of my statement."

Even though, at present, I give the greatest credence to an interstellar U.F.O. rigid theory, there is really nothing that will help us in other places within our solar system could not be similarly valid. Merely because it probably is not "like us" we know it.

Neil Pizoor, in the British Magazine, DISCOVERY, believes that some well-known cosmology, both psychological and physical, includes some curious notions. He cited an example of existing food to liberate energy as a means of life, which would mean that animal could breathe nitrogen and drink liquid ammonia.

The study of "xenobiology" exists among eminent scientists. From the USAF reports of 1947-1949 this came from the USAAF interest in possible life on other planets. However, it is difficult to determine whether the atmosphere from the atmosphere or the ground had penetrated it.

We will soon have to broaden our concept of what constitutes living organisms. Life forms faced with different activities, stimuli, and food sources could well develop very different appearances, shapes, and chemical reactions to adapt to their particular needs.

Another thought, Doctor Maxim might (the only reason I believe in your explanation) be that only some bacteria affected by U.F.O.'s. They have been heard, and smelled (which, to a layman might seem fantastic) and have physically disturbed some vehicles and at least the place of a "core" of a "source" of disturbance, which might suggest some study by attributing this to the "visitors' imagination." (simultaneous imagination)

To clarify your question, I currently do not give credence to the theory of the "Kareeta" U.F.O. theory, but there are obviously some variables of "inside" U.F.O.'s. However, I believe that a strong, credible, and unbiased investigator cannot ignore any contacts. All must be carefully examined. Certainly one might be to the real thing.

(The old Navy-world story again) The scientific world could be cautious, incredulous, materialistic and small minded, like the Newburgh who might not believe what seemingly happened, might even deny their one-the-spot reporters sent there.

By the way, here is something I've been trying to learn for years. I wrote to the Harvard Dept of Astrophysics and the Observatory of the time (1948) for further information, but never received a reply.

Enclosed you can tell as the complete story. In 1948, in the NEW YORK TIMES, I saw an article mentioning a statement from the Harvard Observatory that there were three "near" objects called in the TIMES paper, circling the Sun in the 23rd April, 1948. I believe, was reported to be 250,000 miles from the Earth of the Earth, and one was 250,000 miles behind the Earth.

I tried to get further details, was ignored. Can you, as a fellow investigator, get more information on this matter?

I too, write without recourse, though with some impatience of your single-mindedness. I don't mind a good debate, only I have little time to participate, and I look as office and a secretary.

It would be a pleasure to have you aboard my aircraft. I think, however, that when I invited you on the contract, it would become as to state this subject until on the ground where I have billeting room.

Dear Capt. [Redacted]:

I am certainly grateful to you for your letter of February 5, the great effort that you put into preparing it, and the honesty and fairness of your manners. I do not have time for a lengthy reply, but I shall try to answer a few of the major questions.

In the strictest sense, I am not sure whether I am "aiding the Air Force in its debunking campaign," or whether they are acting in good faith. But you were completely wrong in your conclusion that ATIC asked me to help them with the "unexplainables" before the Congressional hearings. The chain of evidence, which might even be convincing to an outsider, seems to resemble the finding of arguments that Garfoos and others employ to bolster their belief in flying saucers from outer space.

My recent access to Air Force files was obtained at my own request, made through high Air Force channels. They did not come to me for help. My query to Ramey concerning Casseday's hearings was based on curiosity only for I have not heard a word as to whether the hearings are coming along or not. I believe that my position is the current position of the air force. I can state this because I have talked with the men at ATIC. And from such a disposition and from my impression of the files they have convinced me that the Air Force did not attempt to silence [redacted]. In the course of my investigation of the files, including some of the classic cases, I was able to solve a number of them and they have accepted my solutions.

I very well know voluntarily and was not after vengeance. This conclusion, the limit of my association with ATIC or any other government agency concerned with UFOs, I am not dodging this by device wording. It is not a job either unwillingly or officially "taken in." Perhaps I can explain to you perhaps in jargon to show that I really mean it. The official position of the Air Force is that UFOs are not from outer space.

The bulk of the pilot reports have been solved to the satisfaction of the Air Force and Air Force scientists. I am quite sure that the NICAP discharge will not accept this and will try to prove otherwise. As for the scientific report, I have a copy of it and will release it in my forthcoming

book. Incidentally, I should have indicated that it is this book that prompts my giving time to a debate with you and Dr. Ramey. Even though I may not agree and do not expect to agree with your position, I find that I could rather add more fairly present the position of the believer as a result of such contact. This is something which I certainly cannot get from anyone.

I am not going over this question of burden of proof again. But the Air Force records show examples where one of the pilots tried to design a UFO and where the other pilot claimed it was only a meteor. These were experienced pilots. The proof of the matter was definitly made through observation, minimizing from the ground. The convincing proof was from pilots, who experienced same. Can make scores of the type that I have claimed.

We have found similar cases of mirages of stars.

As for the Zacatecas, when someone produces an actual space ship or inhabitants thereof, I stand ready to be convinced. However, the point that I remain unable to make with either you or Ramey--and certainly not with Keyhoe--is that the great majority of the sightings fall into a simple and clear-cut pattern. We have definite answers for most of these, including even the Flatwoods and optical glare. Therefore, I do not have the will to believe that some of the cases where factual data are clearly missing, such as the precise bearing of a sighting, or the precise timing, and I do not concede that this makes that sighting valid over those where the data are available and where, by consequence of additional information, a definite non-extraterrestrial source was identified.

With reference to the television program, I do not recall ever having been contacted by Frank Edwards. I do get many requests to appear on radio and TV. Most of these I have to turn down because of the pressures of other business. Some of them I turn down because of the extra time and effort involved in travel. Certainly, if I did turn that one down, it had nothing to do with you. It could have been that Edwards hoped to get me said found that I was out of the country. We would have a company make an idea. But I do a great deal of traveling, both here and abroad, and sometimes a request through my office will ascertain the fact that I am not available.

I do not recall ever having received an invitation from Capt. Hull either. I do not even know who he is.

Charles Maney, who has also written me, and to whom I intend to send a copy of this letter, objects to my use of the phrase "interplanetary UFO's." In his wishes the term "non-terrestrial UFO's." This I accept.

Perhaps the reason why I am taking the time to correspond with you is due to the fact that your sighting is unique. I have not seen official records to back your claim that sightings like yours were seen in the same area.

SUMMARY: (This summary is a condensed version of report. Give highlights in final and intermediate paragraphs. Reproduce in final paragraph.)

Unidentified flying objects were observed at Nouasseur Air Base and other points in French Morocco 13 July 1952. This report is an edited telepinter report of these observations submitted by Major George W. Mac Sweeran, Wing Provost Marshal, 80th Air Depot Wing. Major Mac Sweeran's report is based on information obtained by the base CSI Detachment through personal interviews.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. The Preparing Officer visited Nouasseur Air Base 25 July 1952 to investigate reported sightings of unidentified flying objects.

2. Leland H. O'Neal is a graduate engineer and former Curtis-Wright project engineer on T. S. Navy Hellcat aircraft. Capt Ira Vance has 13 years experience as a pilot. Capt Marc B. Klien is a non-rated officer. He was formerly an aircraft mechanic. According to the report submitted by CSI to the Wing Provost Marshal, O'Neal and Sanchez did not convey prior to the interview.

3. Base Operations at Nouasseur Air Base reported no flares fired. Base Weather Station released balloon at 2100 hours and was airborne until 2122 hours. No known French or USAF aircraft reported in subject area at time of sightings. Visibility was good during all reported sightings.

4. Reports of sighting aerial objects appeared in Atlantic Courier, (local newspaper), 12 and 21 July issues. (See Enclosure)

5. Mr. Kruegar, TAI representative in Morocco, and party observed the reported objects from the terrace of the American Key Club, Casablanca, 11 July 1952. This initial sighting is unknown.

6. Various sightings occurring between 2100 and 2200 13 July 52 were reported to local newspaper from Marrakech, Oukamedden, Oufranon, Chichaoua, Louis Gentil, Settat, Casablanca, Bournzika, Skirat, and Ain-Sefra near Oran. Although newspaper reports were not given in detail, all were substantially the same after the initial report by 3rd Bomber to the local newspaper entitled "Flying Saucers". On 13 July 1952, all other reports followed at approximately the same time.

Capt.                                                                February 14, 1952

I think it is highly unlikely that your sighting represents a non-terrestrial UFO. Merely because that assumption fits the observed facts, and because there is no immediately available alternative, it does not justify jumping to this conclusion. This is the chief point of contention between the believers and the non-believers. If I seem to harbor the point of the reflection, I wish to eliminate that first, before I try to find other alternatives. I ask you for the details of the sighting.

I do not think I can usefully comment on your discussion of gravitation, and no one. I am perfectly aware of the latest field theory and what it implies. One thing that I does not imply is that inertia can be nullified even if gravitation could be. Anybody, whether in a field of gravitation or not, subjected to severe accelerations in one direction would unquestionably suffer a reaction in the opposite direction. In an automobile crash, the person who meets his death against the windshield does so with, may I stress, from gravity. A space ship reversing in the field where no gravitation exists at all would cause its occupants to be thrown against one side of the interior. Now, if you want to say that perhaps you can make a gravitational harness that will cushion this acceleration, you are wholly to accept it. But it is surprising that experimental studies in this field have not disclosed any telling of such an effect.

With respect to your question about a heavy layer of ionized air immediately around a fast-moving craft to protect a metal skin from friction, I would say that the cushion, if moving with the vehicle, would protect the metal. However, the cushion itself would then be subject to the friction and probably would rapidly rub off. We can possibly see the large reason or bodies entering the earth's atmosphere. A cap of ionized gas forms on the front. But the friction between this cap and the surrounding atmosphere is still great enough to develop enough heat to melt the surface of the meteor.

With respect to the photograph, I would certainly have to see it in order to comment intelligently. I have seen such alleged photographs, however. Some of them are fuzzy because of bad guiding. The image, even of a star, is some of the best cameras, is always blurred towards the edge. And I do recall having seen a picture such as you describe, blobs connected with ganglions. This is something that I analyzed and found that the person taking that picture apparently had the shutter on time exposure. At least the shutter speed and the ganglions were the two main things during the exposure. Sometimes the light entering the camera does not come at all from the direction that the image appears. A bright light falling on the lens can produce a ghost image with an effect similar to the one you describe.

As to your question about charges of a single edge, that is easy to disprove. Only in the thinnest narrow beam, as in a vacuum tube, and then usually only in a presence of a focusing magnetic field, can you get a beam of charges of a single kind. The repulsive forces of these charges

tend to disperse them. And so, if you are proposing this as an alternative suggestion, I reject it, at least in the form you have suggested, because it is inconsistent with Maxwell's laws of electricity and magnetism.

Thank you for the details of your sighting. I have not had a chance to plot them on a diagram or re-analyze them.

What confuses me a trifle is your statement that the western horizon was completely dark. My own calculations, which probably I should recheck, showed that the sun set at 19 hours and 21 minutes local time. Your sighting was located at 20:12 EST, which corresponds to 20:40 local time. This, the sighting was 45 minutes after sunset. The sky should have still had considerable brightness unless there were heavy obscuring clouds low on the western horizon. The theoretical end of twilight is 21:12.

You have stated the reasons for believing the non-terrestrial UFO explanation. I agree with Haldane and Einstein. But I also think that mystery, like charity, begins at home. There are still plenty of mysterious terrestrial phenomena and I am simply pointing out possibilities that I consider these much more likely than a mysterious non-terrestrial phenomenon. In my opinion, it is much further from some of these bacterial organisms to man than it was from inert matter to the microbes. You refer to detachment by other means. I am aware of a few cases where heating is involved. But the only cases were small, such as the Florida scoutmaster, smelled worse than the reported saucer.

With reference to your final question, there is nothing to support the claim made in the 1943 New York Times that three asteroids are circling the sun in the earth's orbit. It was certainly not a Harvard observation.

I enclose herewith my tentative schedule on PAN from Mexico City to Caracas and return. Hope to see you and I promise to avoid the subject in the cockpit, unless we chance to see some non-terrestrial UFO's. That wouldn't be something, wouldn't it?

Again, I want to thank you for your frank and honest replies to my questions. At least we both know where we stand.

Cordially yours,

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 95-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
of three including First Officer William B. Nash and second Officer
William H. Fortenberry. As a pilot spending much of his life in the
air, Captain Nash had long been interested in the question of UFOs,
and during the long night hours of overwater flights he had often
cut down the cockpit lights to search the sky. In five years of watching he had observed hundreds of meteors, various types of auroral
display, the lights of other aircraft, and the multicolored images of
stars and planets distorted by refraction, but he had never seen
any unidentifiable aerial phenomenon that appeared to be under
intelligent control-until this particular night, when he was not
watching for UFOs.

Shortly after 8 p.m. E.S.T. the plane was cruising on automatic
pilot at about 8000 feet over Chesapeake Bay, and approaching
Norfolk, Virginia. The sun had set and the night was almost entirely
dark, although the coast line was still visible. Fortenberry, sitting at
the right as copilot, was making his first run on this particular course
and Nash, in the pilot's seat at the left, was pointing out the cities
and landmarks of the route. Nash had just called attention to the
lights of Newport News and Cumberland, ahead and to the right
of the plane, when at 8:12 a brilliant red glow suddenly appeared
in the west, apparently between Newport News and the aircraft,
and so low that it night almost have been on the ground. One of
the men exclaimed, as have so many incredulous witnesses on first
seeing a UFO, "What the hell is that?"

Looking through the front windows of the cockpit, they watched
the unidentified light traveling northeast at incredible speed on a
horizontal course roughly a mile below the plane. Immediately they perceived that the unknown was actually a procession
of six red-orange lights glowing like hot coals. Shooting forward
like a stream of red tracer bullets, the line of lights moved out over
Chesapeake Bay until they were only about half a mile away from
the plane. They appeared to be sharply defined, large, circular
disks, arranged in a narrow echelon formation-like a set of stairs
tilted slightly to the plane's right, with the leader at the lowest step,
each following disk slightly higher and to the rear, and the last disk
at the highest point (see Figure 17). Realizing that the line was

apparently going to pass under the plane at the right on the co-pilot's side, Nash flipped off his seat belt so that he could move to the window on that side. During this brief interval he was not able to see the objects, but Porterberry kept them in view. As he later described their amazing behavior, all the disks simultaneously turned up on edge, like coins, so that the glowing surfaces were tilted to the right. Still on edge, they suddenly reversed their relative places so that disk 1 now occupied the last place in line and disk 6 became the leader (Figure oo).

This shift had taken only a brief second and was completed by the time Nash reached the window. Both he and Porterberry then observed the disks flip back from the on-edge to the flat position.

In the same fraction of a second, the entire line changed direction as abruptly as a ball bouncing off a wall and shot away to the west on a heading of 270 degrees. An instant later two similar disks darted out, apparently from beneath the plane, and joined the line as numbers 7 and 8 (Figure oo). The lights receded to the west, suddenly disappeared, immediately reappeared, abruptly began a steep climb to an altitude above that of the plane, then vanished not in sequence but in random order. The sighting had lasted for a period of two to fifteen seconds.

After a quick check showed that no one else in the aircraft had observed the lights, the pilots radioed a message to the CAA station at Norfolk for forwarding to the Norfolk Navy Base, reporting eight unidentified objects traveling at speeds in excess of 1000 miles an hour. In Miami, next morning, Air Force officials questioned both witnesses. According to their estimates, the disks had moved horizontally about 2000 feet above the ground until their final climb and disappearance, were about 100 feet in diameter, and about 15 feet thick. Since they apparently traveled fifty miles during the twelve to fifteen seconds they were in view, their velocity would have been some 6000 to 12,000 miles an hour.

Intelligence officials first checked the air traffic. Five jets from Langley Air Force Base, near Newport News, had been in the region at the time of the sighting, but they were ruled out as an explanation for the disks. Both pilots were informed that seven other persons, apparently on the ground, had reported unknown lights in the Norfolk area; the Air Force files contain no record of these reports and it is probable that some, at least, of these persons mistook the sunset-reddened jet trails for UFOs.

Few sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena have been more clearly described. Both witnesses were experienced pilots. Nash had flown more than 10,000 hours at altitudes of 7000 to 8000 feet and had held the rank of captain for eight years. Both men had been trained to observe accurately, to check and double-check every factor that might affect safe flying, and to regard the word "assume" as a potential killer. They shared the attitude, all cautious airmen: "In God we trust—everyone else, we check." [5] Unlike many UFO descriptions, their report distinguished rigorously between fact and inference, and it included the exact time of the sighting as well as the location, height, speed, and direction of flight.

Using a kind of "instinct judgment" gradually developed during;

A Possible Explanation of the Nash-Fotenberg Disk

In the hope of solving the mystery, even though a decade has passed, the authors of this book have made a thorough study of the available evidence and present the results in the pages that follow.

* We wish to thank Professor G. A. Massey and Captain W. B. Nash for their generous help with this problem. Although they do not agree with our conclusions, Professor Massey has kindly made available certain useful documents and Captain Nash in a lengthy correspondence has patiently answered a great many questions of detail.

When puzzling observations in a laboratory seem to point to a conclusion that contradicts the main body of scientific knowledge, the researcher first tries to repeat the experiment and duplicate the observations. If this is impossible, as with the Chesapeake Bay phenomena, he next re-examines the assumptions on which the conclusion is based. The belief that the UFO, had an extraterrestrial origin is based chiefly on two assumptions: first, that the estimates of the disks' size, distance, and speed were reasonably accurate; and second, that the disks were solid objects. If either assumption is unsound, the extraterrestrial theory is unnecessary and the incident becomes much less of a puzzle.

Both witnesses were able and experienced observers. Nevertheless their determinations of distance and size, and hence of speed, are open to question because of the very fact that the disks were unidentified phenomena. Angular estimates are usually reliable when an observer is judging the position and speed of other known aircraft moving in the sky. But when the moving object is a strange one and is seen against an empty sky or flat ground containing no standards of comparison, estimates of actual size mean very little.

The ability to judge distance depends largely on the binocular vision of the observer's eyes, separated by a span of about 2.5 inches. Focused on an object at 300 feet, they subtend an angle of about one-fortieth of a degree, less than one-tenth the diameter of the full moon. This is a physiological fact, and means that if the observer is more than 300 feet away from an object of unknown size, he cannot determine its distance accurately unless he knows how large it is or unless he can compare it with a known object. Using angular estimates, the witnesses in the Chesapeake Bay case calculated that at the point of closest approach the disks were a mile lower than the plane and about half a mile to the north-a distance of roughly 7000 feet. Mentally comparing their appearance with that of a DC-3 aircraft at this distance, the observers arrived at an estimate of size-whose accuracy depends on having a known distance. The circularity of this process indicates the weakness of all the estimates given. Even the most skillful observer cannot accurately judge the distance of an unidentified object when he does not know its true size, and he cannot judge the size unless he knows its actual distance.

Over Norwich, Connecticut, on May 15, 1962, a cloudless day with perfect visibility, a Navy aircraft and a commercial airliner plane reported a near collision at about 7000 feet. The Navy pilot filed a complaint, stating that the two planes had missed each other by a distance of only about 600 feet. According to the commercial pilot, who did not file a complaint, the planes had had a leeway of about 3000 feet-a more than sixfold difference! [5]. Thus good pilots can differ widely in estimating the position of objects in the sky, even known aircraft seen in full daylight. With an unrecognized phenomenon, seen in darkness or in semidarkness, as in the Chesapeake Bay case, good estimates are impossible.

The extraterrestrial conclusion depends even more strongly on

the second assumption, that the UFOs were material objects. Nearly
every part of the description is in direct conflict with this idea. The
instantaneous reversal of course, for example, if performed by solid
objects, should have produced a shock wave that would have
broken windows in Norfolk, Newport News, and points west. Only
one observation even suggests that the unknowns had a material
nature; when the disks flipped on edge they seemed to reveal bot-
tom surfaces, which would indicate a solid body. The witnesses
specifically qualified this statement, however, by adding that though
they had the impression that the "bottom surfaces" were unlighted,
they did not become clearly visible. Thus the three-dimensional
structure was not actually observed, but only inferred. The night
was dark, the UFOs were glowing like hot coals, and were sup-
posedly more than a mile away. Even if the disks had been solid
objects, an observer could actually have seen only a circular-shaped
light that suddenly narrowed to a very thin ellipse; if he believed
the object to be solid, he might infer the presence of other surfaces,
but a side edge 15 feet thick and an unlighted bottom surface, even
if they had existed, would not have been detectable.
Of the other observations, all are inconsistent with the theory
that the UFOs were material in nature. All, however, are completely
consistent with the theory that the disks were immaterial images
made of light.

Images made of light can glow with brilliant colors, can show well-defined circular shapes, and can flip on edge. Since they are not subject to the forces of gravity and inertia, they can travel at incredible speed, change direction sharply and instantaneously, and perform all of the maneuvers ascribed to the UFOs. On this new assumption, the observations become credible and the major part of the mystery vanishes.

Only one problem remains. Just exactly what produced the images? Of the many possible explanations, we first considered the simplest, an astronomical source. The UFOs appeared low in the we:tern sky at 8:12 p.m. E.S.T., about forty-five minutes after sunset. The night was dark, for the moon had just entered its last quarter and would not rise until much later. Apparently the only planet that could have been involved was Mercury. Settling a little more than an hour after the sun, it should have been visible above the western horizon at the time of the sighting, but since it was not particularly brilliant, having a magnitude of a little more than +0.6, we put aside the astronomical theory, for the moment, as improbable.

We next explored the possibility of multiple reflections in the glass windows of the cockpit, produced by a light source inside the plane (such as a cigarette), or in the air outside (such as the bright-red exhaust trail of one of the jets in the area.) Like the astronomical theory, this idea was set aside as improbable. Learning to distinguish between a reflection and a real light seen through a cockpit window is part of every pilot's training. When he sees a strange light, he automatically makes the proper checks. Furthermore, Nash and Porterfield had observed the disks through three separate windows having different orientations.

Accepting the overwhelming probability that the source of the UFOs was outside and below the aircraft, we concluded that it was almost certainly on the ground. The densely populated coastal region near Newport News and Norfolk, with several airfields and military installations, included countless possible sources such as a searchlight, an illuminated advertising sign, an air beacon. Stratified clouds or inversion layers of temperature and/or humidity could have multiplied such a light into a series of glowing disks. The soundness of this theory, of course, depended on the prevailing weather conditions. According to the reports, on the night of July 14 roughly a third of the sky at 20,000 feet was covered with thin cirrus clouds, practically invisible, at lower altitudes the night was cloudless and simply clear, however, was no apparent haze. Visibility was unlimited, and no temperature inversion existed. Under such conditions the suggested mechanism would obviously not operate.

A more detailed survey of the weather conditions, however, quickly showed that this picture was greatly oversimplified. At 8:12a, the time of the sighting, the night had already become quite dark. Yet the sun had set only forty-five minutes earlier and, according to the almanac, twilight should hold until have read until local time. Thus there must have been a dense cloud bank low in the west.

to distinguish between a reflection and a real light seen through
a cockpit window is part of every pilot's training. When he sees a
strange light, he automatically makes the proper checks. Further-
more, Nash and Fortenberry had observed the disks through three
separate windows having different orientations.

Accepting the overwhelming probability that the source of the
UFOs was outside and below the aircraft, we concluded that it was
almost certainly on the ground. The densely populated coastal re-
gion near Newport News and Norfolk, with several airfields and
military installations, included countless possible sources such as a
searchlight, an illuminated advertising sign, an air beacon. Strati-
fied clouds or inversion layers of temperature and/or humidity could
have multiplied such a light into a series of glowing disks. The
soundness of this theory, of course, depended on the prevailing
weather conditions. According to the reports, on the night of July 14
roughly a third of the sky at 20,000 feet was covered with thin cirrus
clouds, practically invisible; at lower altitudes the night was cloud-
less and sharply clear, there was no apparent haze, visibility was
unlimited, and no temperature inversion existed. Under such con-
ditions the suggested mechanism would obviously not operate.

A more detailed survey of the weather conditions, however,
quickly showed that this picture was greatly oversimplified. At 8:12,
the time of the sighting, the night had already become quite dark.
Yet the sun had set only forty-five minutes earlier, and, according to
the almanac, twilight should not have ended until 9:01 local time.
Thus there must have been a dense cloud bank in the west. Also,
according to Captain Nash, there was probably some unstable
air, which in itself indicates inequalities of temperature and/or
humidity.

A thorough study of the situation showed that inversions of both
temperature and humidity must have been present. In the summer
of 1952 all the eastern states were suffering from an intense heat
wave and drought, and the ground cooled rapidly after sunset, be-
cause of the lack of cloud cover during the day. In a period of heat
and drought, the nightly cooling produces marked inversions favor-
able to extreme reflection or reflection. Small in extent, existing
only briefly in one place, constantly changing location, such inver-
sions may not be detected by radiosonde observations [9]. During
July and August, temperature inversions occurred almost every
night in the coastal regions and accounted for the radar angles so
frequently observed in the Washington area during those weeks (see
Chapter viii).

The fact that the sighting occurred over Chesapeake Bay is sig-
nificant. A body of water cools more slowly than the land, and the
air over water is warmer than that over land. The cooler air from
the land is carried over the water by convection currents, flows in
and under the warm air, is heated by the water and rises, to
be replaced in turn by the further flow of cold air from the land.
The air over a lake, river, or other body of water also has a higher
moisture content than over the land and can form an invisible haze.
All these facts lead inescapably to the conclusion that sharp lo-
calized discontinuities of both temperature and humidity must have
existed over Chesapeake Bay on the night the UFOs appeared. A
light on the Virginia coast, shining northeast toward the plane, could
easily have been spread out into a series of images like those ob-
served. A change in the orientation of the light or a shift in the loca-
tion of the inversion would account for the abrupt change of course
made by the disks.

Since the plane was flying at a ground speed of about 195 knots
(225 to 250 miles an hour), it would have traveled about a mile

In the summer of 1952 all the eastern states were suffering from an intense heat wave and drought, and the ground cooled rapidly after sunset, because of the lack of cloud cover during the day. In a period of heat and drought, the nightly cooling process makes radar inversions favorable to extreme refraction or reflection. Small in extent, existing only briefly in one place, constantly changing location, such inversions may not be detected by radiosonic observations [9]. During July and August, temperature inversions occurred almost every night in the coastal regions and accounted for the radar angles so frequently observed in the Washington area during those weeks (see Chapter xiv).

Since the plane was flying at a ground speed of about 195 knots (225 to 250 miles an hour), it would have traveled about a mile during the twelve or fifteen seconds the disks were in view. This distance would have changed the relation between moving plane and stationary ground light, so that the images would no longer have been visible from the plane. By flying on, the witnesses left the phenomenon behind them.

Obviously this solution does not identify the particular beacon, searchlight, or other ground light that produced the Chesapeake Bay disks. But it does offer a highly probable explanation that is consistent with all the observations and does not depend on the presence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

The Chesapeake Bay Case

Two of the most famous UFO cases, the Nash-Fortenberry and the Tombaugh sightings, have never been completely explained even though the witnesses were unusually competent. The incidents fully described, and the basic facts not in dispute. Although the probable type of mechanism involved is clear in each case, determining specifically what factors combined in exactly what way to produce the phenomenon has so far proved impossible. Neither case, however, supports the theory that the UFO had an extraterrestrial origin.

On the evening of July 14, 1952, a Pan-American DC-3 was flying from New York to Miami, carrying ten passengers and a crew

their many hours in the air, they had made careful estimates of the
position, height, speed, and direction of flight of the unknowns.
Nevertheless, no reasonable explanation of the disks was found.
At the time of this incident flying saucers had been big news for
many weeks. Both Life and Look magazines had recently published
serious discussions of the possibility that flying saucers come from
other planets, and newspapers were printing dozens of reports of
weirdly glowing machines trailing fiery exhausts, streaking through
the air at meteoric speeds (see Chapter vi). At ATIC, the small
staff of eight men was swamped with saucer reports, far more than
they could deal with properly, and some of the investigators were
privately convinced that UFOs did come from outer space [6]. For
those or other reasons, the Norfolk sighting unquestionably received
a less adequate study than would a similar incident today. The case
was dropped and filed as an Unknown.
The incredible velocity and instantaneous change of course reported were obviously impossible for any earthly vehicle; no known
metal could have escaped being melted by the frictional heat produced during so swift a passage through the dense atmosphere at
2000 feet, and no human flesh and bone could have survived the
smashing inertial forces involved in the instantaneous change of
direction. Nash and Fotheherry finally stated their own conviction:
"Though we don't know what they were, what they were doing here
or where they came from, we are certain in our own minds that
they were intelligently operated craft from somewhere other than
this planet" [7].

MIAMI, Fla., July 15.-(UP)--
Two Pilots Sight
Eight "Saucers"
Near Norfolk

Two veteran Pan American Airways (PAA) pilots reported today they saw eight huge "flying saucers" flying at 1,000-mile-an-hour clip near N   lk, Va., last night.

W. B. Nash said he and W. H. Fortenberry saw six of the strange craft, estimated to be 100 feet in diameter and "glowing orange-red like hot coals," fly in formation some 6,000 feet beneath their DC4.

The six "things" turned westward sharply when the PAA plane passed overhead and were joined by two other similar flying discs, Nash said. The eight "saucers" zoomed upward to an estimated 10,000 feet altitude before the glowing light emanating from them "pulsated off" and they disappeared into the sky, Nash said.

Nash, 35, estimated that he and Fortenberry, 39, "watched the whole maneuver" for between 10 and 12 seconds.

Nash, a first officer for PAA and a flying employe for 10 years, said he and Fortenberry "would judge that the eight objects were definitely intelligently controlled, whether from within or without - we couldn't say."

"Also," said Nash, "we can be reasonably positive, that none of us - as we know, pilots - could physically endure the centrifugal force that would be imposed on the occupants when making turns of such violence as these objects made."
