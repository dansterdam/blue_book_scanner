UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PROJECT: 3-A, 46029 AISS
I. SOURCE: Mr. XXXXX, Green Bay, Wisconsin
Age: 28
Occupation: Serviceman for National Cash Register Company
Education: Unknown
Qualifications: Unknown  
II. RELIABILITY: Unknown
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was outside of his residence, looking at the sky, at approximately 9:00-9:15 P.M. on August 13, 1955. He saw 2 objects, in a sequence, which he first described as parachutes, but later stated that they were not parachutes. The objects were about 100 to 150 feet from him and he saw something run from the objects to the ground. The objects then made several sharp ascents and descents which seemed to stumble over each other. Source does not know what the material was that looked like pieces of pottery. Source does not believe the objects were any type of aircraft.
Source also sighted a small, transparent parachute land 100 to 150 feet from his location. Source then saw the 2 objects he had originally observed disappear, and he could not find any trace of the parachute.
Source also saw four (4) more of the parachutes which took on an appearance of bubbles, and then disappeared.
The next night the source also sighted what appeared to be a wing type aircraft, but he was not sure what it was, and stated that it might have been a hawk.
Source also saw a glow in the sky about a month ago, then a circular object with a red glow, traveling very rapidly, north to south.

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

ORIGINATING AGENCY: FLIGHT 3-A, 4602D AISS

REPORT NO.: 3-A-UD-2-55

PAGE: 3 OF 4

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

(1) The reference subject was UFOR, and this information had been made available to this office on 287, July 1955. The previous statement of the observer via telephone included the essential details and requested UFOB, and Section of the 0768th AD & W Sqdn did not personally contact the observer.

(2) The Miller Center at Green Bay, Wisconsin, was contacted by TR, and the information correlated with that given to this office. The Center stated that two policemen and later two detectives were sent to the home of the observer. The information from the interview is that the material further stated that the individual had been under a doctor's care for some time prior to the UFOR sighting, and they could not learn the nature or the ailment. They said that individual appeared sober, but his face was flushed.

(3) The UFOB observer stated that he had been in the Ground Observer Corps military service (2) years at Laona, Wisconsin, and that he does not have any military service.

COMMENTS OF FIELD OFFICERS:

1. A study of written accounts and apparent fabrication on the part of the source, and the facts that on several other occasions sources has claimed to have observed similar happenings, indicates the possibility of falsification. However, the report does not contain a detailed account of the incident to be analyzed by the intelligence personnel.

2. The value of the physical evidence is not pertinent to this case, as the witnesses did not obtain or have physical evidence that could further confirm the validity of their observation.

SIGNATURE:
RONALD B. LETH
2nd Lt.- USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer. The sighting was fabricated and is a hoax.
