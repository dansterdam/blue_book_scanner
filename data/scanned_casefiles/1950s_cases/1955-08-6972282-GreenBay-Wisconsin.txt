III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was outside of his residence, Green Bay, Wisconsin, at 2507502 August 1955, when he saw a helicopter like (4) to Five (5) feet high, with three (3) foot rotors. The helicopter landed 100 to 150 feet from and he was something run from the aircraft which looked like a little man or dog. He then ran after the aircraft, which took-off, and then he tried to change the lithium man or dog, and while doing so stumbled over some material that looked like pieces of pottery. Source does not believe that the material fell off the UFOB, but thinks that a parachute cover.

Source also sighted a small transparent parachute land 100 to 150 feet from him and something a foot high, that looked like a little man run away from the parachute. Source then tried to the parachute but it had disappeared, and he could not find any trace of the parachute, or the foot high man that ran from it.

Source also saw four (4) more of the parachutes which took on an appearance of bubbles, and then disappeared.

The next night the source also sighted what appeared to be a wing type aircraft, but he was not sure and said that it might have been a hawk.

Source also saw a glow in the sky about a month ago; then a circular object with a red glow, moving speedily north to south.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. Reference subject UFOB, the originating officer of TT MSG AIORS-03-267, was contacted via TP and stated that the information had been received by telephone from the Filter Center at Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Operations Section of the 676th AO & W Sqdn did not personally contact the observer of the UFOB.

2. The Filter Center at Green Bay, Wisconsin, was contacted by TP, and information received from Sgt Wilson who states that he spoke to observer of the UFOB, but did not see "pottery" in question. Sgt Wilson also stated that two policemen, and later two detectives were sent to the home of the observer of the UFOB, and the statement of the detectives is that the material looked like pieces of pottery from a casserole top, or cover. The detectives further stated that individual had been under a doctors care for some time prior to the UFOB sightings; however, they could not learn the nature of the ailment. They said that individual appeared sober, but his face was flushed.

3. UFOB observer stated that he had been in the Ground Observer Corp for two (2) years at Lomira, Wisconsin, and that he does not have any military service.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. Due to fantasy of UFOB, and apparent fabrication on the part of the source, and the fact that on several other occasions source has claimed to have observed what appear to be paranormal happenings, the reliability of the information is very doubtful.

2. The value of the physical evidence is not pertinent to this case in so far as the observer stated that he personally did not believe it fell off, or was part of the UFOB. The, perhaps further appears to be part of a fabricated UFOB, in the hoax category.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was fabricated and is a hoax.
