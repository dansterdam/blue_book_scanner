10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
KC-97's on refueling mission sighted 1 obj at 0705Z, contacted radar site which had obj on scope at 0708Z. Site held intermittent con- tact for 19 min, KC-97 tried to close after obj appeared (usually) to be hovering at 10 o'clock position. Obj climbed to est 40-50,000' when KC-97 tried to close. KC-97 lost visual contact Obj moved very fast, changed direction and jumped off radar scope. Formed circular patter then line abreast/

11. COMMENTS
Object still on P scope then accelerated to 1600 K and moved NE. Fighter scrambled negative results. At same time, radar was painting 5 smaller objs below KC 97's at an alt of 5 - 10,000'.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Balloons                     ☑ Possibly Balloon

PAGE SEVEN
"ARCHIE 29" CALLED "ENRAGE" CONTROL AND VERIFIED MY ACCOUNT OF THE
OBJECT. AFTER POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF "ARCHIE 29", THE DISCUSSION
OF THE OBJECT WAS REFERRED TO AS TO ITS POSITION FROM "ARCHIE 29".
I VERIFIED ALL OF "ARCHIE 29'S" INFORMATION AND CONTINUED WATCHING
THE OBJECT UNTIL APPROX 23 MILES FROM HARMON FIELD. FROM THE INFORMATION
"ENRAGE" WAS GIVING "ARCHIE 29" IT WAS APPARENT THAT "ARCHIE 29"
WOULD MAKE ANY FURTHER REPORTS ON THIS OBJECT, SO I DECIDED TO LAND
AT HARMON AND CLEARED RC FROM THIS "ENRAGE" FREQUENCY." SIGNED LT ROBERT
W SICHENKO AN T77521 AFCT COMDR, KC-ST97 ARX (TDY EHAFD)
PART 6 "AFTER WE FINISHED OUR REFUELING RUN AT APPXY 0739Z, WE
RESUMED OUR HOMELAND COURSE AND WE HEARD LT SICHENKO REPORT THE
BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS MOVING VERY FAST AND ERRATICALLY. RIGHT AFTER
THE LIGHT CLOUD OUR SAW THE OBJECT AND POINTED IT OUT TO ME. I COULD
SEE IT. IT LOOKED LIKE A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT, LIKE STAR. WE TURNED TOWARDS
THE LIGHT AND DOUBT WAS THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED MOVEMENT. IT APPEARED
STATIONARY FOR QUITE A WHILE AND THEN IT MOVED IN EITHER NORTHERLY
OR SOUTHERLY DIRECTIONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES. EACH TIME IT MOVED,
WE TURNED, WE LOST TO KEEP IT AT 12 O'CLOCK POSITION. "ENRAGE"
FIRST REPORTED WE WERE 45 MILES FROM THE OBJECT. THE SKY WAS
FAIRLY LIGHT ON THE HORIZON AND BY CONTRAST THE OBJECT APPEARED
VERY BRIGHT. IT WAS AT ITS BRIGHTEST WHEN "ENRAGE" INFORMED US THAT
WE WERE 15 MILES FROM IT. AFTER THE SKY WAS GETTING LIGHTER, THE
OBJECT BECAME DIMMER AND MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE. ABOUT 0833Z, IT
DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY." SIGNED LT DAVID GUELDNER AC 3035255 CO-PILOT,

WAS NOTIFIED AND CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD PICKED UP 4 OR 5 TARGETS

PAGE THREE
ANOTHER ACFT APPROX 23 MILES TO THE REAR OF "ARCHIE 29" REPORTED A
SIGHTING OF THE SAME OBJECT IN THE SAME LOCATION.
THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS FLYING A VERY ERRATIC COURSE, MAKING
SHARP CHANGES IN DIRECTION. BOTH ACFT REPORTED THAT THERE WERE NO
CLOUDS WHATSOEVER NEAR THIS ALTITUDE THAT MIGHT CAUSE A REFLECTION.
APRXX 0717 Z AND AREAD WARRANT OFFICER TRAGETS IN THE AREA REPORTED
POSITION, AND IT MADE RADAR CONTACT WITH A TARGET GLUING CLOSE TO THIS
STATION. THE SLIGHTED OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY SLOWLY AT THIS
TIME AN EXCELLENT RADAR CONTACT WAS MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.
THE OTHER ACFT REPTD ALSO, THAT AT THIS TIME THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE
HOVERING. THE OTHER GROUP OF OBJECTS DETECTED ON RADAR WERE
MOVING VERY FAST, SOMETIME IN A CLUSTER, THEN STRUNG OUT IN LINE
FORMATION. DUE TO SLOT ANTENNA ROTATION, HIGH SPEED AND CHANGING
COURSE OF THESE OBJECTS, SPEED CHECK WAS NOT AVAILABLE. ESTIMATE
SURFACE WOULD BE 15363 KNOTS. THIS GROUP OF TARGETS WAS
EST'D ON COURSE NO 165 DEGREES NEY AT FROM 55993-13,396 FEET,
(ASKED "ARCHIE 29" IF HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO CLOSE ON THE SIGHTED
OBJECT WITH CAUTION, FOR A BETTER REPORT. THE PILOT OF "ARCHIE 29",
LTI H G SPEER AGREED AND CHANGED COURSE TOWARD THE OBJECT. APPROXIMATE
RANGE TO THE OBJECT WAS 43 MILES. THE OBJECT WAS STILL HOVERING IN THE
APPROX SAME LOCATION. AS TIRE RANGE DECREASED, THE OBJECT BAGAN
TO FLY TILE MVC NORTHWARD. AFTER TRAVELING NORTH ABOUT 13 MILES THE
OBJECT MADE A TURN BACK SOUTH. "ARCHIE 29" CLOSED TO WITHIN 13 MILES
OF THE OBJECT, THEN IT BEGAN TO MOVE OFF IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION
AGAIN ABOUT 357 DEGREES TRUE. "ARCHIE 29" REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT

PAGE FOUR
WAS MOVING NORTHWARD AND CLIMBING. HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
NOT CLOSING ON IT ANY LONGER. AT THIS TIME I REQUESTED PERMISSION
FROM "DIGNITY" CONTROL CENTER TO "SCRAMBLE" WAS COMPLETED.
RANGE OF OBJECT BY THIS TIME WAS 33 DEGREES TRUE AT 9 MILES.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, A MOMENTARY CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT WAS MADE ON
OUR HEIGHT FINDER. ALTITUDE WAS 53533 FEET. "ARCHIE 29" REPORTED THAT
LOUIS GETTING MUCH HIGHER AND FADING FROM VIEW, DUE TO LESSENING
OBJECTS REFLECTIONS ON IT, AND ALSO SUN SHADE WAS RESTRICTING VISION.
WHENQUIRE ABOUT ANOTHER OBJECT WAS 113 MILES NORTH OF THE STATION.
SIGHTS WERE COMING INTO MISSION, AS RADAR WAS IMPINGEMENT.
FIGHTER PILOT, SHAKO 55, REPORTED HIS AIRBORNE VISUAL CONTACT.

THIS STARTED TO SET THE STAGE FOR WHAT PHENOMENON WAS NOTICED. ALL UNK OBJECTS
SIGHTED ON THE RADAR WERE WITHIN THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR RADAR SET11*
STANDS FIRST IN ANTHONY G SCRINPACE AO 514143 INC ELECT OFF, 6443
ACRON
ATw 74091077, THE NAVIGATOR GAVE US A HEADING OF 313.2 DEGREES
PART TWO JUST AFTER WE TURNED TO THIS HEADING SCHINCK READ HIS 
RECT OF THE OBJECT AND I LOOKED OVER WHEN HE CALLED IT IN AND THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD HELP IF I VERIFIED THAT HE SAW BECAUSE I SAW THE
SAME THING AT APRX THE SAME POSITION. ENGAGE IDENTIFIED BOTH OF US
MY CURSOR. ENGAGE DETERMINED THAT I WAS APRX 17 MILES CLOSER TO
TO THE OBJECT SO HE HAD ME GIVE CHANGE. THE OBJECT AT THIS TIME WAS 
APPRX 58333 FEET MY ALTITUDE WAS 18, 383 FEET. THE DISTANCE WAS APRX 
3.5 MILES. WHEN I FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECT, IT MOVED TO THE LEFT IN
A VERY PRECISE MOVEMENT AND A VERY FAST MOVEMENT. THERE WERE NO
LOW INCIDENT OF DESCASE IN SPEED. IT WAS A VERY DEFINITE FAST
MOVEMENT. IT DID THIS TWICE. WE TURNED TO A HEADING OF 633 DEGREES
AND THAT PUT THE OBJECT AT 12 O'CLOCK OUR POSITION. WHILE TRACKING THE
OBJECT, IT MADE SEVERAL TURNS TO THE NORTH AND SEVERAL TURNS TO THE
SOUTH WHICH WERE VERIFIED BY "ENGAGE".WE CLOSED OUR DISTANCE TO
THE OBJECT TO APRX 15 MILES AND AT THAT TIME I INCREASED MY POWER
AND TRIED TO INCREASE MY SPEED BUT DUE TO RUNNING LOW ON
FUEL, I HAD TO EXERCISE MY POWER ONCE MORE. OUR INDICATED AIR
SPEED WAS APPROX 313 MILES PER HOUR. WE NEVER LOST CONTACT WITH THE
OBJECT UNTIL APPROX AT 09103. WHEN WE GOT WITHIN 112 MILES OF THE OBJECT,
IT STARTED A DEFINITE CLIMB TO AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF BETWEEN
35,333 AND 48,939 FEET. AT 953297, WE LOST CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT

PAGE SIX
BECAUSE THE SUN WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US. AS THE SUN ROSE HIGHER,
THE LIGHT BEGAN TO GET DIMMER AND DIMMER UNTIL WE COMPLETELY LOST
SIGHT. IF WE HAD NOT SEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE OBJECT, WE WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A BRIGHT STAR, BUT THE VERTICAL AND LATERAL 
AND VERTICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE OBJECT KILLED THAT BELIEF. THE OBJECT
WAS SIGHTED BY AT LEAST 5 OF MY CREW MEMBERS.
AT 96252 AS WE WERE MAKING CONTACT WITH OUR RECEIVERS, WE SIGHTED AN
OBJECT WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT AT APX 103,9692 FEET. IT WAS BELOW AND TO 
TO OUR LEFT HEADING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. IT WENT FORWARD TO OUR
LEADERS POSITION AND TURNED AROUND AND CAME DIRECTLY BACK FROM THE
HEADING OF 299 DEGREES. MY SECOND NAVIGATOR CALLED MY ATTN TO THIS
OBJECT, BUT I DISREGARDED IT THINKING IT WAS JUST ANOTHER ACFT.
AFTER I PASSED CUS PO 101, WE LOST CONTACT.
JR AEO 1355AD7 COMD KC-97WARS (TDY ETAFB) SIGNED LT HOMER B SPEER,
PART 5 WE TURNED OFF AFTER COMPLEITION OF REFUELING, THE TIME BEING
APPRX 073072, AND TOOK UP A HEADING FOR HARMON WHICH WAS 125 DEGREES.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, "ENGAGE" CONTROL NOTIFIED ME OF AN ACFT AT 7 
MILES OFF MY LEFT WING. I VERIFIED THIS POSITION BY VISUALCONTACT
SHORTLY AFTER. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, AT 13, COLCK TO MY POSITION, I
NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH 3 CREW MEMBERS, WE
DECIDED TO ENGAGE. 
WE MOVED VERY RAPIDLY. I DECIDED TO CALL "ENGAGE"
CONTROL TO VERIFY THE LIGHT. I TOLD "ENGAGE" CONTROL THAT IT WAS 
APPROX. 113CLCK FROM MY POSITION AT FROM 15,000 TO 29,533 FEET,
CONTINUED TO SKY 735 MILES. I TOLD THER THAT 173 WAS MOVING VERY,
RAPIDLY SOMETHING LIKE THOSE FLYING SAUCERS. SHORTLY THEREAFTER,
