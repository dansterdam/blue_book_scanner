10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
KC 97's on refueling mission sighted 1 obj at 0705z, contacted radar site which had obj on scope at 0708z. Site held intermittent contact for 49 min, KC 97 tried to close after obj appeared (usually) to be hovering at 10-0 o'clock position. Obj climbed to est 40-50,000'. KC-97 tried to close. KC-97 lost visual contact then obj's moved very fast, changed direction and jumped off and on scope. Formed circular pattern.

11. COMMENTS
Object still on P scope then accelerated to 1600 K and moved NE. Fighter scrambled negative results. At same time, radar was painting 5 smaller objs below KC 97's at an alt of 5 - 10,000'.

"ARCHIE 29" CALLED "ENRAGE" CONTROL AND VERIFIED MY ACCOUNT OF THE OBJECT. AFTER POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF "ARCHIE 29," THE DISCUSSION OF THE OBJECT WAS REFERRED TO AS TO POSITION FROM "ARCHIE 29." I VERIFIED ALL OF "ARCHIE 29'S" INFORMATION AND CONTINUED WATCHING THE OBJECT UNTIL APPRO 29 MILES FROM HARMON FIELD. FROM THE INFORMATION ENGAGE WAS GIVING "ARCHIE 29" (T WAS APPARENTLY THAT "ARCHIE 29" WOULD MAKE ANY FURTHER REPORTS ON THE OBJECT, SO I DECIDED TO LAND AT HARMON AND CLEARED FROM THE "ENRAGE" FREQUENCY. SIGNED LT ROBERT W SCHRECK AO 17724 ACFT COMDR, KC-97SV ARX (TWO SHARED).

PART 6 WATER WE FINISHED OUR REFUELING RUN AT APPRO 37032, WE RETURNED ON OUR HOMEWARD COURSE AND WE HEARD LT SCHRECK REPORT THE BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS MOVING VERY FAST AND ERRATICALLY. RIGHT AFTER THAT THE ACFT COMDR SAW THE OBJECT AND POINTED IT OUT TO ME. I COULD SEE IT. IT LOOKED LIKE A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT, LIKE A STAR. WE TURNED TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED MOVEMENT. IT APPEARED STATIONARY FOR QUITE A WHILE AND THEN IT MOVED IN EITHER NORTHERLY OR SOUTHERLY DIRECTIONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES. EACH TIME IT MOVED, WE TURNED THE ACFT TO KEEP IT AT 12 O'CLOCK POSITION. "ENRAGE" FIRST REPORTED ME WERE 45 MILES FROM THE OBJECT. THE SKY WAS FAIRLY LIGHT ON THE HORIZON AND BY CONTRAST THE OBJECT APPEARED VERY BRIGHT. IT WAS AT ITS BRIGHTEST WHEN "ENRAGE" INFORMED US THAT WE WERE 15 MILES FROM IT. AFTER THE SKY WAS GETTING LIGHTER, THE OBJECT BECAME DIMMER AND MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE. ABOUT 0832, IT DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY." SIGNED LT DAVID GUELDNER AC 3 038255 CO-PILOT.

FOR AFOIN2A1 REF UROB SIGHTING NEAR HARMON AFB 07002 TO 27517 6 JUL
REPT, BY 2 KC-97 ACFT. DIR/INTEL NEAC EVALS THE SIGHTING REPT AS
2 DIFFERENT INCDS WHICH APPEARED TO CORRELATE AND SUPP EACH OTHER.
THE VIS PORTION OF THE SIGHTING, AS RPTD BY KC-97, IS EVALD AS BEING
VENUS AS VIEWED THRU ATMOSPHERIC INSTABILITY. AS REGARDS THE RADAR
PLOTS, THE 5 RAPIDLY MOVING ERRATV BLIPS COULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT
OF AN ELCT PHENOMENON. SUCH TRACKS HAVE APPEARED ON RADAR SCOPES IN
THE AREA AT PREV TIMES. HOWEVER, THIS IS THE 1ST SUCH OCCURRENCE
RPTD BY RADAR SITE AT HARMON. THE ADDITIONAL BLIP WHICH APPEARED
TO CORRELATE WITH THE VIS SIGHTING MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN
ELCT PHENOMENON. FURTHER, AT NO TIME AS HE OBJECT RPTD BY RADAR
SITES AT GANDER, NEWFOUNDLAND, OR ST ANTHONY, NEWFOUNDLAND,
ALTHOUGH AT TIMES DURING THE SIGHTING IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN
THE COVERAGE OF BOTH STAS. OTHER DISCREPANCIES, SUCH AS THE HEADING
OF THE OBJECT AS PLOTTED BY THE RADAR, VERSUS HEADING OF ACFT DURING
ITS CHASE, SUPP THIS EVALN THAT THERE WERE 2 SEP INSTANCES THAT
SEEMED TO CORRELATE AND WERE 1.

REF ADDAO 164 AND ADDAO 165 THIS IS FOLLOW UP REPORT OF PERSONNEL
STATEMENTS. THIS MSG IN 4N PARTS. IT INCLUDES 5 SIGNED STATEMENTS
WHICH MAY CONSTITUTES A VITAL INTELLIGENCE SIGHTINGS. PART 1 "I WAS
AT THE CONTROLS AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT
WHEN IT WAS CALLED TO THE ATTENTION OF THE CREW IN THE FOUR PART OF
THE ACT THAT THIS PARTICULAR OBJECT WAS MAKING ERRATIC MOTION
IN THE SKY. AT THIS TIME, UPON SIGHTING THE OBJECT MYSELF, I DID NOTICE
THAT THE OBJECT WAS MAKING A VERY IRREGULAR ZIG ZAG PATTERN AT A POSITION

PAGE TWO
OF APPRX 14 OCLOCK LOW ON THE HORIZON. OUR ALTITUDE AT THAT TIME WAS
16,000 FEET, OUR HEADING 125 DEGREES. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO HAVE
TAKEN THE ALTITUDE OF OUR ACFT. THE EASTERN SKY WAS JUST
BECOMING TO LIGHT UP, THE TIME BEING APPRX 0700, AND THE OBJECT
WAS VISIBLE THROUGH WHAT LOOKED TO ME TO BE A INVERSION LAYER. MY
FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT IT WAS VERY LIKELY THE MORNING STAR OR
VENUS AND THAT IS ERRATIC MOTION MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED TO REFRACTION
AND OUR OWN RELATIVELY FWD MOTION. HOWEVER AT THE TIME THAT "ENRAGE"
WAS NOTIFIED AND CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD PICKED UP 4 OR 5 TARGETS
IN THIS SAME AREA, I BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER IT WAS THE MORNING
STAR OR SOMETHING ELSE. BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SIGHTING AND
THE TIM THAT WE STARTED OUR LEFT-DOWN, WHICH WAS APPRX 1-1/2 HOUR,
IT IS MY ESTIMATE THAT THE OBJECT CHANGED ITS POSITION WITH RESPECT
TO THE HORIZON BY APPRX 15 DEGREES OF ELEVATION AND 5 DEGREES AZIMUTH.
AFTER THIS BEFORE MENTIONED ANGLE OF ELEVATION INCREASED, THE OBJECT
MOVED OUT OF THE SUSPECTED INVERSION LAYER AT WHICH TIME THE EXTENT
OF ITS ERRATIC MOTION SEEMED TO DIMINISH AND ONCE AGAIN I THOUGHT IT
WAS POSSIBLE THE MORNING STAR. SIGNED LT PAUL J DAILY AO 1697967
CO-PILOT, KC-9797ARS (TDY EM AFB)
PART 2 "AT 27052 THIS DATE, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM "ARCHIE 21"
CO-97 ENROUTE TO HARMON AFB. HIS POSITION AT THIS TIME WAS 263
DEGREES TRUE, 30 MILES FROM HIS STATION. "ARCHIE 21" REPORTED SIGHTING
AN UNKNOWN OBJECT IN THE AIR TO THE LEFT OF HIS ACFT, SLIGHTLY ABOVE
HIM, MOVING AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS. IMMED THEREAFTER, "ARCHIE 29"

Here is the OCR text from the document:

PAGE THREE
ANOTHER ACFT APPRX 20 MILES TO THE REAR OF "ARCHIE 29" REPORTED A
SIGHTING OF THE SAME OBJECT IN THE SAME LOCATION.
THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS FLYING A VERY ERRATIC COURSE, MAKING
SHARP CHANGES IN DIRECTION. BOTH ACFT REPORTED THAT THERE NO
CLOUDS WHATSOEVER NEAR THIS ALTITUDE THAT MIGHT CAUSE A REFLECTION.
APPRX 37@7Z I MADE RADAR CONTACT WITH A TARGET IN THE REPORTED
POSITION, AND ALSO WITH SEVERAL OTHER TARGETS SLIGHTLY CLOSE TO THIS
STATION. THE SIGHTED OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY SLOWLY AT THIS
TIME AND EXCELLENT RADAR CONTACT WAS MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.
THE OTHER ACFT REPORTED ALSO, THAT AT THIS TIME THE OBJECT SEEMED TO
BE HOVERING. THE OTHER GROUP OF OBJECTS DETECTED ON RADAR WERE
MOVING VERY FAST, SOMETIME IN A CLUSTER, THEN STRUNG OUT IN LINE
FORMATION. DUE TO SOME INTERNAL ROTATION HIGH SPEED AND CHANGING
COURSE OF THESE OBJECTS, SPEED CHECK WAS NOT AVAILABLE. ESTIMATE
OF SPEED WOULD BE 1500 KNOTS. THIS GROUP OF TARGETS WAS DETECTED
INITIALLY ON THE HEIGHT FINDER AT FROM 5,000-15,000 FEET.
I ASKED "ARCHIE 29" IF HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO CLOSE ON THE SIGHTED
OBJECT USING CAUTION. FOR A BETTER REPORT. THE PILOT OF "ARCHIE 29",
LT H SPEER AGREED AND CHANGED COURSE TOWARD THE OBJECT. APPROXIMATE
RANGE TO THE OBJECT WAS 45 MILES. THE OBJECT WAS STILL HOVERING IN
APPRX THE SAME LOCATION. AS THE RANGE DECREASED, THE OBJECT BEGAN
TO SLOWLY MOVE NORTHWARD. AFTER TRAVELLING NORTH 10 MILES, THE
OBJECT MADE A TURN BACK SOUTH. "ARCHIE 29" CLOSED TO WITHIN 15 MILES
OF THE OBJECT, THEN IT BEGAN TO MOVE OFF IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION
AGAIN ABOUT 370 DEGREES TRUE. "ARCHIE 22" REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT

UNCLASSIFIED OPERATIONAL IMMEDIATE

PAGE FOUR
WAS MOVING NORTHWARD AND CLIMBING. HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
NOT CLOSING ON IT ANY LONGER. AT THIS TIME I REQUESTED PERMISSION
FROM "DIGNITY" (CONTROL CENTER) TO "SCRAMBLE" WAS COMPLETED.
RANGE OF OBJECT BY THIS TIME WAS 330 DEGREES TRUE AT 8 MILES.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, A MOMENTARY CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT WAS MADE ON
OUR HEIGHT FINDER. ALTITUDE WAS 35000 FEET. "ARCHIE 29" MADE ON
OBJECT WAS GETTING MUCH HIGHER AND FADING FROM VIEW, DUE TO LESSENING
OF SUNS REFLECTIONS ON IT. AND ALSO OUR SHADED RESTRICTIONS VISION.
WHEN FIGHTER BECAME AIRBORNE, OBJECT WAS 119 MILES NORTH OF THE STATION.
FIGHTER PILOT, SHAKO 55, REPORTED HIS RADAR WAS INOPERATE
WE REQUESTED HE CONTINUE MISSION FOR ATTEMPT AT VISUAL CONTACT.
WHEN SHAKO 55 REACHED "ARCHIE 20'S" POSITION, THE OBJECT
HAD FADED FROM VIEW. BOTH ACFT WERE NOW 150 MILES NORTHEAST OF THIS
STA. ACFT WERE TRANSFERRED TO GANDER CONTACT MOMENTARILY, THEN TURNED
BACK TOWARDS HARMON. BOTH LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT." SIGNED
END LT CHARLES H DENNEY USAF SENIOR DIR, 640 ACRON
PART 3 FROM THE PERIOD OF 17035 JULY TO 23035 JULY 55, I ASSUMED
THE DUTIES OF CD AT THE 640 ACURON SITE. AT APPRX 37@3Z, I WAS CALLED
INTO OPERATIONS BY THE SENIOR CONTROLLER, WHO IN TURN ADVISED ME
OF UNK OBJECTS BEING VIEWED ON THE RADAR. IN CHECKING ALL RADAR
OPERATIONS, IT WAS FOUND THEY WERE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.

SIGNED FIRST LT ANTHONY G SCARPACE AO 941448 GND ELECT OFF, 643

PART 4 "AT 07092, THE NAVIGATOR GAVE US A HEADING OF 132 DEGREES
TO HARMON. JUST AFTER WE TURNED TO THAT HEADING LT SCHNECK MADE HIS
KEPT OF THE OBJECT AND I LOOKED OVER WHEN HE CALLED IT IN AND THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD HELP IF I VERIFIED WHAT HE SAW BECAUSE I SAW THE
SAME THING AT APPROX THE SAME POSITION. ENGAGE IDENTIFIED BOTH OF US
BY OUR PARROT. ENRAGE DETERMINED THAT I WAS APPROX 7 MILES CLOSER
TO THE OBJECT SO HE HAD ME GIVE CHANGE. THE OBJECT AT THIS TIME WAS
APPR 25300 FEET BY ALTITUDE WAS 18,600 FEET. THE DISTANCE WAS APPROX
53 MILES. WHEN I FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECT, IT MOVED TO THE LEFT IN
A VERY DEFINITE MOVEMENT AND A VERY FAST MOVEMENT. THERE WERE NO
SLOW INCREASE OR DECREASE IN SPEED. IT WAS A VERY DEFINITE FAST
MOVEMENT. IT DID THIS TWICE. WE TURNED TO A HEADING OF 030 DEGREES
AND THAT PUT THE OBJECT AT 12 O'CLOCK OUR POSITION. WHILE TRACKING THE
OBJECT, IT MADE SEVERAL TURNS TO THE NORTH AND SEVERAL TURNS TO THE
SOUTH WHICH WERE VERIFIED BY "ENRAGE". WE CLOSED OUR DISTANCE TO
THE OBJECT TO APPROX 15 MILES AND AT THAT TIME I INCREASED MY POWER
AND TRIED TO INCREASE MY SPEED BUT DUE TO RUNNING LOW ON
FUEL, I HAD TO DECREASE MY POWER ONCE MORE. OUR INDICATED AIR
SPEED WAS APPROX 210 MILES PER HOUR. WE NEVER LOST CONTACT WITH THE
OBJECT FOR A COMPLETE HOUR WHEN WE GOT WITHIN 12 MILES OF THE OBJECT,
IT STARTED A DEFINITE CLIMB TO AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF BETWEEN
35,000 AND 40,000 FEET. AT 08097, WE LOST CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT.

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE SIX
BECAUSE THE SUN WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US. AS THE SUN ROSE HIGHER,
THE LIGHT BEGAN TO GET DIMMER AND DIMMER UNTIL WE COMPLETELY LOST
SIGHT. IF WE HAD NOT SEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE OBJECT, WE WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A BRIGHT STAR, BUT THE DEFINITE HORIZONTAL
AND VERTICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE OBJECT KILLED THAT BELIEF. THE OBJECT
WAS SIGHTED BY AT LEAST 5 OF MY CREW MEMBERS.

AT 08252 AS WE WERE MAKING CONTACT WITH OUR RECEIVERS, WE SIGHTED AN
OBJECT WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT AT APPROX 10,000 FEET. IT WAS BELOW US AND
TO OUR LEFT HEADING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. IT WENT FORWARD TO OUR
LEADERS POSITION AND TURNED AROUND AND CAME DIRECTLY BACK FROM THE
LEADING OF 299 DEGREES. MY SECOND NAVIGATOR CALLED MY ATTN TO THIS
OBJECT, BUT I DISREGARDED IT THINKING IT WAS JUST ANOTHER ACT.

AFTER IT PASSED OUR POSITION, WE LOST CONTACT." SIGNED LT HOMER H SPEER,
JR AO 135-675 ACFT COMDR KC-9797ARS (DRY EHARB)

PART 5 "WE TURNED OFF AFTER COMPLETION OF REFUELING, THE TIME BEING
APPROX 07042, AND TOOK UP A HEADING FOR HARMON WHICH WAS 125 DEGREES.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, "ENRAGE" CONTROL NOTIFIED ME OF AN ACFT AT 7
MILES OFF MY LEFT WING. I VERIFIED THIS POSITION BY VISUAL CONTACT
OF SAID ACFT. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, AT 10 O'CLOCK TO MY POSITION, I
NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH 3 CREW MEMBERS, WE
DECIDED THE LIGHT WAS MOVING VERY RAPIDLY. I DECIDED TO CALL "ENRAGE"
CONTROL TO VERIFY THE LIGHT. I TOLD "ENRAGE" CONTROL THAT IT WAS
APPROX 13 O'CLOCK FROM MY POSITION AT FROM 15,000 TO 20,000 FEET,
AN ESTIMATED 59 MILES. I ALSO TOLD THEM IT WAS MOVING VERY
RAPIDLY SOMETHING LIKE THOSE FLYING SAUCERS SHORTLY THEREAFTER,
