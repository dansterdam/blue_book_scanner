MINNEAPOLIS STAR-TRIBUNE
"OBJECT SPOTTED - SPRING - 1958"

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN (AP)-A flying object, which was observed in the sky over Sweden on April 7 was officially described today as a strange phenomenon.
The object, described as a long, dark cigar-shaped object with flashing lights, was seen by several persons, including a Swedish air force pilot. The air force said the object was not an aircraft and that it remained a mystery.
The Swedish Defense Staff said the object was observed by competent observers at a number of places in Southern Sweden and that it flew at a high altitude.
The report said the object was seen for about 10 minutes and then disappeared.

The image shows the relative positions of various celestial bodies, including stars and planets, along with text explaining the phenomenon. There are no human faces visible in this image.

Text extracted from the document:

VENUS IS CHRISTMAS STAR
On December 14th Venus will be close to where the Sun sets, taking on a brilliant point that looks very star-like.
JAMES HEISER

One-Star is Brightest
This time of year Venus is at its brightest, second only to the moon in brightness.
Venus rises in the east shortly after sunset and is visible for several hours after dark.

Crescent Venus
As Venus circles the Sun, it goes through phases like the Moon. Right now Venus is a crescent, with most of the disk remaining dark.
This crescent phase makes Venus appear brighter than in its more fully illuminated phase. As the planet wanes toward a thinner crescent, its brightness will become more star-like.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for November 14,1957
SCIENCE NEWS FOR DECEMBER
A REPORT MADE AT DULUTH, MINNESOTA
TIME OF INCIDENT: 6:30 p.m., December 6, 1957
WEATHER: Skies overcast, wind from the east at 8-10 mph. Temperature around 30 degrees.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
If it tonight, and the appear half dark 
and the other half light. It moved across the sky, going from west to east, at an angular speed not much faster than a commercial jet. It seemed to climb up a bit as it moved to the east. Estimated time in sight: 1-1/2 to 2 minutes.
This night, I was on the roof of my house, looking northward. I use night time to observe the heavens, so this was not an unusual thing for me to be doing. The object first caught my eye as it moved across the northern part of the sky. At first, I thought it might be a jet, but it was much larger and more brilliant than any aircraft I had ever seen. As it moved across the sky, it seemed to be lit from within, with the darker portion on one half and the lighter portion on the other half.
As it moved to the east, it appeared to climb slightly, then went out of sight behind some trees. I lost sight of it and was unable to observe it further. The object seemed to be at an altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: This is not the first time I have seen these strange objects in the sky. They seem to be a recurring phenomenon. I am always on the lookout for them, as they are quite fascinating to observe. However, this is the first time I have seen one that was so clearly marked with light and dark portions.
The object I observed tonight differed from those I have seen previously in that it seemed much larger and more brilliant. It also appeared to climb as it moved across the sky, which is not typical of the ones I have observed before.
I am a regular observer of the night sky, and I can assure you that this was no conventional aircraft. The size, speed, and lighting pattern of the object were unlike anything I have ever seen before, either in the air or among the stars. I am at a loss to explain what I witnessed, but I can say with certainty that it was no ordinary plane or satellite.
That is why I am reporting this incident, in the hope that others who may have seen similar objects will come forward. Only through the collection of multiple eyewitness accounts can we hope to gain a better understanding of these mysterious phenomena.
I am Dec. 21 (the date), which has apparent errors in the day is 6th, as stated earlier.
This is the same sighting - the beginning of the report and details provided show it is the same case. I noticed the discrepancy in the date and wanted to correct that.

NO CASE (Information Only)                          18 December 1957
Mrs. Marcos:

TALE OF TWO DISCST
Do you remember what happened when Reverend Mr. Macellist, a scoutmaster who lived at a strange adventure with a UFOAP in 1955? He told a news reporter in a report on UFOs, "One day we saw the thing that changed history", but you admit that you cannot recollect all details. Some of them were very strange indeed and distorted, and changed the view that you had before by observations of the aerial phenomenon. According to the account, the reverend was pursuing an unknown object which had hovered low over vegetation on the hillside, discovering later that it had been carrying out some unspecified mission. 
The whole story is worth careful consideration. The object was said to have made a landing, according to the reverend, and some sort of activity transpired which was observed by other witnesses besides himself. The object was apparently under intelligent control, masking itself at times, and then suddenly reappearing. This report was passed on to official and unofficial investigators as a matter of serious import. The whole case is regarded as potentially more spectacular than some on record.

This issue is no longer important. The important thing is considering this possible hoax or case is in reality a good example of how difficult it is to determine authenticity when dealing with a subject of this nature. We cannot assert categorically that there is no truth whatever in the story, but to the casual reader it seems improbable, contrived, and even fantastic in some parts. Nonetheless, the story was told by a person who presumably had no motive for gross fabrication. The details are quite specific, and could be verified or disproved by further inquiry. At this stage the document is worthless for practical purposes - perhaps it is best to file it away, and turn attention elsewhere.

Arriving at Carimba, I contacted the authorities on the phenomenon that they knew about the flying discs. They said they had nothing to report and did not wish to make any statement. At that time I insisted on going to the farms. How I guessed right was later verified. About two leagues away, in the Camp of Mr. Joao Camargo, Derson (or some such name), Antonio Camargo, two farmers, spoke to me, saying they had seen the thing. They described the object as dark gray in color, without lighting, and the immense size (approximately 50 feet in diameter). They reported the weather, and the immense trail from a great distance. I could see the exact spot where the thing was supposed to have landed. Mrs. Dersen, wife of Mr. Marcellino DanIle, local farmer, had seen a great circle imprinted in the field. People in the lower part of the great structure shined. Intensely I called Mrs. Bonilla, but she was not at home. However, according to a few people who were of opinion that they could identify the thing that had hovered low over the hill and gone away, leaving a trail of disturbance and evidence behind.

All the pieces where the 415 meters (about 160 feet) had dropped (about 50 feet) The width of the strip forming the ring was half a meter (about 20 inches). On the north side of the place there was some moss green line left in the grass. The thing had hovered in the slope of the hill so that there is a difference in the colouring and texture of the damaged grass. The fact that the ring formed and the evidence of heating in the grass, indicates something of an appreciable weight and a controlled descent and ascent. The report states that the object was grey in colour, about 50 feet in diameter, without any lights showing, and the weather was clear and the sighting was made by more than one witness. This case, while not spectacular, does seem to contain some elements of possible substance, and might repay further discreet investigation if opportunity offered. At the moment, however, the document must be filed away, with the notation that it is a potentially interesting case, but lacks the validation that would justify any active pursuit at the present time.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a textual document from Project Blue Book, likely describing a UFO sighting or incident.

The text in the document is as follows:

North shot door yellow grass green grass South yellow grass all around. This was constituted by bands of various vegetation of the entire passage. It had become more or less uniform in density. The outer ring (yellow grass) was somewhat sparse while the inner ring (green grass) was quite dense.

Beneath the ring was constituted by the 180-degree arc of a saucer-shaped object the upper edge of which measured 53 feet in diameter. Without knowing the exact dimensions, it appeared to be between 3.5 to 4 feet in height, the highest and the lowest edge of the ring, the highest being (north shot door) and the lowest being (south yellow grass). 

The variation in density of vegetation was caused by the residue of the object, which was nothing in the vicinity did it might have a effect and suggested some electrical matter. Aside from the ring, the grass was perfectly fresh and is now pre-dominately green. There was a slight discoloration of the vegetation near the ring, which has continued no toxins. There are many more details that would take too long a time to enumerate.

I regret that getting around many difficulties I succeeded in meeting. However, certain bodies in charge of the area where the object was evidently sitting by the table in the law enforcement community is not altogether relevant. Word apparently has reached them that I was inquisitive and they took steps to avert any more so-called "Bolelia" episodes, leaving in so many words that the case of his now represents a potential radiative state in Brazil.

(The photographic documentary with details was extremely difficult to be obtained. It had been withheld no chance for good analysis. As to the material of the ring, the observation and further analysis can not be assured in other places for further verification.)

The article discusses an encounter between a teacher and what she describes as "little men in a flying cigar". The article provides details about the teacher's observation and speculates on the nature of the sighting.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                 16 DECEMBER 1957
SAYBROOK, CONNECTICUT

One of the most unusual sightings related to the Two-State UFO Study Group for adults was an encounter in December 1957 by a schoolteacher from Connecticut. This teacher, whose name and location are concealed, encountered a strange object over her home windows, and at least four passengers, which hovered near her home and seemed to be communicating with her, according to her report.

Little Men in Flying Cigar: That's What Teacher Saw
By Ralph Chapman
According to the Civilian Saucer Intelligence in New York, this is the story as the teacher told it:

"As I was sitting in my room one evening, I happened to glance out the window and saw a large, cigar-shaped object hovering silently over my house. The object appeared to be about 60 feet long and 20 feet in diameter. 
As I watched, fascinated, I noticed four small figures inside the object, peering out of windows. The figures appeared to be human in form, but only about four feet tall."

The teacher said the figures were dressed in something resembling tight-fitting metallic cloth. She said their heads were slightly larger in proportion to their bodies, and their skin appeared to be a pale, greenish color.

"I stared at the figures for several minutes," the teacher said. "They seemed to be looking around, not directly at me, but just surveying the countryside. After a short time, the object began to slowly move away, gaining considerable speed as it went. In the space of about 30 seconds, it had disappeared completely from sight."

The teacher said she immediately reported the incident to the Civilian Saucer Intelligence, which is attempting to investigate the sighting. The claim that the object was "cigar-shaped" and contained the reported occupants is considered significant by students of the UFO mystery.

Stuart Nixon, director of the civilian group, said the case is being thoroughly investigated and will be included in a forthcoming report. "We feel this is one of the most unusual sightings to be reported to us in recent years," he commented.

"PONTIAC PROJECT "BLUE BOOK"
INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 
DIRECTORATE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS 
AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO
6 December 1957
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting - Duluth, Minnesota 
ATTN: AFOIN-4A
1. At approximately 2330 hours on 6 December 1957, the following report was received from a project officer at Duluth AF Station:
2. At about 2100 hours on the evening of 6 December 1957, the on-duty tower operator and several others on the base observed a strange light in the sky approximately 15 miles northwest of the station. The light was first noticed by the tower operator and one of the airmen on duty. According to their description, the light appeared to be about the size of a star, pale in color, and seemed to be approaching the base from the northwest. The on-duty officer and several airmen were summoned and also observed the light. 
3. As the light approached, it appeared to increase in size and brightness. Suddenly, about five miles from the base, the light expanded greatly in size and gave off a brilliant white flash, illuminating the surrounding area. The flash was followed by a strange wobbling motion and the object then appeared to spin on its axis. This motion continued for about 30 seconds and the object then appeared to accelerate rapidly, gaining altitude and disappearing from view to the southeast.
4. Several attempts were made to scramble aircraft to investigate the sighting but none were airborne at the time. The tower operator, a TSGT, stated that the object was at least 50,000 feet in altitude and was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed when it departed.
5. I have no further details to report at this time.
