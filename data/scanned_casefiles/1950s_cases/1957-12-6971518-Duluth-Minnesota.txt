There is a handwritten note on the right side of the document that appears to say "Sputnik" and "Dec".

The document appears to be a page from a UFO or unidentified flying object report, specifically from the Space Craft Digest publication from Spring 1958, discussing a sighting in Stockholm, Sweden on 31 December 1956 involving a Swedish Air Force officer.

Venus Is Christmas Star

A statement was made that Venus will be close to the earth in December, making a brilliant pair that lights up the Christmas sky.

JAMES BAIEY

Crescent Venus
It will not be the same as a crescent moon. It will be a crescent in the sense that the planet will be seen as a thin curved line of light.

One-Star Is Brightest

[The rest of the text in the left column is partially illegible]

At the bottom of the page, there is a star chart with two hemispheres labeled "True North" and "True South", showing various constellations and stars. At the bottom of the chart is a note: "SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS" and the word "UNIVERSE" handwritten.

The star chart shows constellations such as Gemini, Canis Major, Orion, Pisces, Pegasus, and others, with stars positioned in their relative locations.

Science News Letter for November 25, 1957

[The text appears to be a scientific article about astronomical observations, with details about Venus and celestial time tables. The full text is quite long, and some parts are slightly blurry. I'll provide the text I can clearly read:]

[First paragraph discusses the moon, its light, and its phases]

The planets of Venus differ from those of the moon in several respects.

As the moon travels around the earth, its distance does not change very greatly, only turning about 71,000 miles in 28,000 miles.

Thus there is no great change in its apparent size, and the diameter of the full moon is about the same as when it is in a narrow crescent phase. But when Venus is full, its apparent diameter is much larger.

[The text continues with more astronomical details]

Winter Arrives

On Dec. 21 the sun, which has apparently been traveling southward in the sky, will reach its farthest southwestern point. This is the winter solstice—the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere—and it occurs at 9:49 p.m. EST.

[The bottom of the page contains a "Celestial Time Table for December" with various astronomical events and times]

A TALE OF TWO DISCS

Do you remember Deverges, that scoutmaster who lived a strange adventure with a
flying saucer, back in 1952? Do you remember what Ruppelt wrote about him in Report
on UFOs?

Many years have passed by since the strange happening in Florida and it is possi-
ble that you do not recall all details. Some of them were very strange indeed and
no satisfactory explanation has ever been given either by Project Blue Book or any
official agency. Ruppelt, interviewing the scoutmaster and, investigating the spot where
a weird machine had hovered, discovering that the roots of the vegetation on that
particular spot were unaccountably charged. Unable to crush the story as told by De-
verges, Ruppelt destroyed the scoutmaster's reputation and the whole affair was dis-
missed by official and unofficial investigators as a hoax. The whole story is worth
reading. The book written by Ruppelt is full of reticences and dubious meanings and
deals with the Deverges affair. Now, the scoutmaster who had been reading Project Blue Book
it is impossible to deny that the book is very good, but to the casual reader it
seems to destroy every scrupulously established fact about saucers, because as the head
of Project Blue Book himself should know what people are talking about. But the mature
ufologists the book might be said to have been written for the sole purpose of con-
vincing the whole world that many instances the continuous method was, graphically intro-
duced and it is apparent that the author evaded, legal action by the persons concern-
ed. By quoting or omitting their names, Deverges, for instance, is simply designa-
ted as "the scoutmaster" while Ruppelt, Chesman, Dahl and Arnold when massacred by Ruppelt
in the "many Islands affair" had their names changed to "Jackson, Richards, and Simpson."
How would it be possible to an un-named scoutmaster, or to non-existent Jacksons,
Richards and Simpsons to take legal action against Ruppelt? The ex-Chief of Project
Blue Book got away unchallenged and this circumstance, plus the officious character
of the book, gives a very dangerous precedent for future ufological publications.

This, perhaps, is no longer important. The important, according to M. K. Jessup
is to find a common denominator for certain phenomena and this seems to have been
found in Brazil very recently; a saucer apparently landed and left "early 1956" to
perfectly fresh vegetation. The story has been published by A Gazeta of Vitoria,
Brazil in January 12, 1958. Here's what happened: Marcos Saiva, reporter of A Gaze
ta heard that a flying disc had landed in a farm in the village of Sao Marcos, 24
kilometers from Vitoria, in the state of Espirito Santo. The thing had happened on
December 15, 1957 but the news only reached (the reporter at the beginning of Janu-
ary) we quote from his story:

"Arriving at Colatina I contacted the authorities on the phenomenon that they knew
about the landing. The authorities said I should look for Senhor Jose Campo Polloto
in Sao Marcos, arriving there I heard from him what I already know and it was docu-
mented by the local press."

"A little caravan comprising Mr. Jose Campo, Norbh (sic) Gamp, Annicleto
Dasso, myself and my wife, succeeded in reaching the spot, regardless of the bad
weather, and the impassable trail. From a great distance, I, Annicleto, saw where
the disc had hovered: a circular door-open ring had been left over a hill...During
the trip to Sao Marcos Mr. Campo, supplied many details to the press. Mrs. Teresa
Bonolla, wife of Mr. Marcolino Bonolla, local farmer, had seen a great circular
object hovering over the pasture on the slope of a little hill in front of her home.
The distance between the hill and the ranch home was about 300 meters (1,000 feet).
The lower part of the great structure shined intensely. Second Mrs. Bonolla, called
her grown-up sons who were inside the ranch; but when they arrived at the window the
thing had disappeared. Perhaps the arrangement of the disc was such that another
made, but for the dark-green ring left in the grass where the thing had hovered, or
landed it could not be traced strongly with the yellow color of grass all around. (During
the investigation the witnesses were unanimous in stating that the same "point" of the
fall in northern United States)."

"At the place where the disc had been we verified that the ring was circular in
shape, its diameter measured 17.4 motors (about 50 feet) and its periphery 53 motors
(about 160 feet). The width of the strip forming the ring was 1.5 meters (about
20 inches). On the north side of the ring there was some sort of concavity distort-
ing the circular shape, almost as if the local inhabitants, thinking the ring
don't, the thing had hovered in the slope of the hill so that there's a difference

of 3.5 motors (10 foot) between the highest and lowest edge of the ring, the highest being on the east side.

[The rest of the text contains multiple paragraphs discussing observations, vegetation, and details about an unidentified object. Some words are partially illegible. The text mentions yellow grass, green grass, and discusses observations of something that appears to be an unusual object or phenomenon. There are references to photographs, documentary details, and discussions about vegetation and ground conditions. The text appears to be part of a detailed investigative report, possibly related to a UFO sighting.]

The last few lines mention "Morro Silva", "Espirito Santo", and discuss some photographic evidence and details about the observation.

No Case (Information Only)                16 December 1957
Old Saybrook, Connecticut

One of the most unusual sightings related to the Two-State UFO Study Group for Adults was an encounter in December, 1957 by a retired school teacher, Mrs. Mary Starr of Old Saybrook, Conn., who reported a close-up sighting of a cigar-shaped object, having lights, windows, and at least four passengers, which hovered near her home on this close encounter. Her story, though 'fantastic', seems to ring of truth.

Little Men in Flying Cigar: That's What Teacher Saw
By Ralph Chapman

OLD SAYBROOK, Conn. Apr. 26 - Mrs. Mary Starr is a school teacher living here in Old Saybrook. She has a bachelor's degree from Middlebury College and speaks several languages.

This is the story she told as we sat before a crackling fire in the living room of her cottage on Long Island Sound:

"In December 1957, so I went to 'The Arrowhead' 10 o'clock. Sometime between two and three in the morning, I was awakened by a noise. I looked out the window and there was what I first thought was a plane in my back garden.

What She Saw
"But when I got my eyes really open, I saw that it was a craft with a body about 30 ft. long and with square port holes. Hovering above my clothesline, it could see three men inside. An antenna poked up from what seemed to be the tail of this object.

"After about five minutes it turned at right angle and I could see that it was so shallow that the men could not have been inside. It was a matter of four feet tall. It glided out of my garden, rose almost vertically, and then disappeared."

Agencies Given Report
Mrs. Starr described the incident to her friend, and then almost immediately, if she had been telling the story as a friend, The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) staff members of the National Investigations Committee heard her story.

Phenomena In Washington: and Miss Isabel Davis, a member of Civilian Saucer Intelligence in New York.

Note: It is known, is dedicated to the idea that the Air Force is not giving the public all the information it should have on "flying saucers," technically known as "unidentified flying objects" or UFO.

Civilian Intelligence Operators believe similar lines on a smaller scale. Both organizations believe that many UFO "sightings" are interplanetary vehicles which have approached or landed on the earth.

Immediately, the Air Force has never admitted such a possibility.

Failing to Investigate all
1. Being too superficial. It does not make auditors independent investigators, even scientific.

2. Refusing to make findings available to Congressional Committees or to the scientific world.

3. Retarding investigation of "sightings" which do not jibe with the available facts.

Immediate objective of the Congressional inquiry should be to get a full-scale investigation of the whole subject.

The longer range objective is to bring scientific education and a truly scientific approach to the problem. NICAP does not have the money at the present time.

DEC. 21, 1957 PONTA PORAN, BRAZIL         (LORENZ; P 138)    6 WITNESSES
MRS. IVONNE TORRES DE MENDOCA, HER THREE CHILDREN, HER SERVANT, MISS BRUNALOI
AND HER YOUNG DRIVER, MARCIO GONCALVES (SEE REPORT FOR MARCH 1958)    02
TRAVELING BY JEEP FROM HER FARM TO THE VILLAGE OF PONTA PORAN.   IN PLACES THE 04
ROAD RAN ALMOST PARALLEL TO THE FRONTIER OF PARAGUAY.   LOW-HANGING CLOUDS   04
COVERED THE SKY AND NIGHT CAME EARLY.   SUDDENLY AT 6:30 P.M. FAR AWAY TO    05
THE SOUTH, MRS. MENDOCA SPOTTED A LARGE BALL OF LIGHT ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE 06
FULL MOON. IT APPEARED TO BE CLOSE TO THE GROUND BUT SHE KNEW IT COULDN'T BE 07
ANOTHER CAR AS THERE WERE NO OTHER ROADS IN THAT AREA.   THE LITTLE PARTY DROVE 09
ON AS THEY DISCUSSED THE POSSIBLE IDENTITY OF THE THING.   THE LIGHT THEN     09
STARTED MOVING RAPIDLY IN THEIR DIRECTION; AND THEY REALIZED IT WAS NOT ONE  10
BUT TWO SPHERICAL, LUMINOUS OBJECTS FLYING SIDE BY SIDE.   THE OBJECTS      11
APPROACHED THE JEEP SILENTLY. GRADUALLY INCREASING THE GAP BETWEEN EACH OTHER 12
SO THAT WHEN THEY WERE NEAR, EACH OBJECT WAS FLYING ALONG A SIDE OF THE ROAD 13
THEY FOLLOWED A HORIZONTAL COURSE BUT OSCILLATED FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER IN 14
A STRANGE, WOBBLING MOTION AND APPEARED TO SPIN ON THEIR OWN AXES.   THEN ONE OF 15
THEM STOPPED IN MID-AIR AND DIVED TOWARD THE GROUND -- STOPPING A FEW FEET   16
ABOVE IT AND ABOUT SIXTY FEET FROM THE JEEP.   THE OTHER OBJECT KEPT          17
MANEUVERING IN CIRCLES ABOVE THE JEEP. OCCASIONALLY GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY    18
CLOSE. THE OUTLINE OF THE OBJECTS COULD NOT BE SEEN CLEARLY BECAUSE OF THE   19
INTENSE LIGHT THEY EMITTED. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE SHAPED 20
LIKE A SPHEROID ENCIRCLED BY A RING AT THE EQUATOR -- SIMILAR TO THE PLANET  21
SATURN. BOTH WERE OF THE SAME SIZE AND OF TWO COLORS -- THE UPPER HEMISPHERE  22
AND THE RING A FIERY RED-TO-WHITE GLOW, THE LOWER HEMISPHERE SURROUNDED BY A 23
WHITE GLOW. THE OBJECTS WERE EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND INTERMITTENTLY SENT        24
BRILLIANT JETS OF LIGHT TOWARD THE JEEP.                                      25
ALL OF THE GROUP WERE FRIGHTENED. THE ROAD WAS DESERTED AND THEY DID NOT     26
KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. NEXT -- ONE CHILD, FERNANDO, WAS ALMOST PARALYZED WITH   27
AND THE OTHERS HAD BEGUN TO CRY. MRS. MENDOCA INSTRUCTED MARCIO NOT TO STOP   28
THE CAR, AND HE BEGAN TO DRIVE FASTER. BUT THE EERIE OBJECTS STAYED WITH      29
THEM SOMETIMES VERY CLOSE. SOMETIMES INCREASING THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE JEEP. 30
AT TIMES ONE OBJECT WOULD GET AHEAD OF THE JEEP AND SHINE A BRILLIANT LIGHT ON 31
THE OCCUPANTS WHILE THE OTHER FOLLOWED CLOSELY BEHIND. APPARENTLY OBSERVING  32
THEM AT OTHER TIMES ONE OBJECT WOULD FLY ABOVE THEM AND DIRECT BEAMS OF      33
LIGHT AT THEM; WHILE THE OTHER DIVED TOWARD THE JEEP AT HIGH SPEED.  MARCIO  34
HAD DIFFICULTY CONTROLLING THE VEHICLE.                                       35
THIS STRANGE CHASE LASTED FOR TWO HOURS UNTIL THE LITTLE PARTY REACHED       36
PONTA PORAN. ONLY TWICE DURING THE NIGHTMARISH EXPERIENCE DID THE JEEP STOP  37
-- ONCE TO TAKE STOCK OF THE SITUATION AND ONCE TO SEE IF THE OBJECTS WERE    38
INTERESTED IN A MOTIONLESS VEHICLE -- THEY WERE. EACH TIME THE JEEP PULLED TO 39
A STOP THE REACTION OF THE OBJECTS WAS INSTANTANEOUS -- THEY WOULD BOTH DIVE  40
AT HIGH SPEED.   ONE WOULD HOVER, THROWING A BEAM OF LIGHT ON THE GROUND WHILE 41
THE OTHER WOULD APPROACH--THE ILLUMINATED SPOT. IT DID NOT LAND -- IT APPEARED 42
TO HOVER MOTIONLESS ABOVE THE GROUND AND ITS BRILLANCY WOULD DECREASE.   THEN 43
THE JEEP-S OCCUPANTS GOT THEIR FIRST REAL LOOK AT THE OBJECT. IT APPEARED TO 44
BE A HUGE METALLIC SPHERE, ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER, ENCIRCLED AT THE  45
CENTER BY A LARGE, APPARENTLY ROTATING METALLIC RING.   THE OBSERVERS SAW NO  46
DOORS, WINDOWS OR PORTHOLES. THERE WAS NO SOUND, NO HEAT, NO ODORS.          47
WHEN THE JEEP BEGAN TO MOVE AGAIN, THE OBJECTS FOLLOWED, AND WHEN THE JEEP    48
APPROACHED THE TOWN THE OBJECTS MOVED AWAY.   BUT WHEN MARCIO STOPPED TO REFILL 49
THE GAS TANK, THE WEIRD GLOVES MADE ANOTHER APPEARANCE. MANEUVERING AGAIN, BUT 50
WHEN THE JEEP STARTED AGAIN, THEY FOLLOWED.   WHEN THEY ENTERED THE TOWN,     51
PONTA PORAN, THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED.   LATER, SHE AND SOME OF HER GROUP       52
AND SOME OF HER GROUP RETURNED TO WHERE THE LAST LANDING HAD TAKEN PLACE.     53
AND FOUND AN ODDLY LUMINOUS HAZE FLOATING IN THE AIR ABOVE WHERE THE OBJECT   54
HOVERED.   THEY WATCHED IT SLOWLY DISSOLVE IN THE FAINT WIND BLOWING FROM THE 55
NORTH.   AND THEY SAW ONE OF THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARING INTO THE WEST IN THE    56
DIRECTION OF THE FRONTIER.                                                    57
