The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically the UFOB Index Card for a sighting that occurred in Parkersburg, Pennsylvania on March 1955.

The text from the document is as follows:

DATE: 5 March 1955
LOCATION: Parkersburg, Pa.
TYPE OF SIGHTING: Ground-Visual
DURATION: Approx. 60 min
COMMENTS: A limited follow-up investigation by Allen E. Hynek, revised that the object firing over the period the 5th or 6th of March 1955 continued for approximately (1) hour. This complies with the conclusion in the reports submitted that he thought the flashes and bursts were approx. over Parkersburg lasting the conclusion that he did see the slow mentioned artillery type firing over Aberdeen Proving Grounds.

Chapter IV
THE SPANGLED HEAVENS: STARS AND PLANETS

Shortly before dawn on March 3, 1955, a spectacular flying saucer appeared over Alaska. The witness, a scientist who had the rank of Commander in the United States Navy, was returning from the North Pole on the daily Air Force Harian weather flight. His mission had been to study the effect of the aurora on radio propagation, for the Department of Defense. He described his experience as follows:

A Mirage of Sirius

"We were flying southwest of Point Barrow, Alaska, not far from the Bering Strait, en route to Eielson Air Force Base in Fairbanks, and our course was roughly southeast. The night was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. I was looking out of the western bomb-blister when suddenly I saw a bright light flash on, far off in the distance, from the horizon. I thought at first it was a meteor or a lightning flash, but the object came to a sudden skidding stop about 500 feet away, thereafter idling along with our plane and keeping pace with our speed, which I could scarcely believe my eyes. The thing possessed a green and red signal lights, like a lighted propeller on the top. Beyond question, it was a flying saucer. 

It seemed to have a brilliance, brought on by fatigue. After all, we had just been up for many hours. I slumped my head back and forth, and tried to rub my eyes, but the Saucer was still there, occasionally wove or dipped. My next thought was to eliminate all possible chance that the thing was an internal reflection. I pulled my fur parka up over my head and put my face smack against the bulging surface of the blister that formed the window. Thus shielded from all internal illumination, I could still see the glowing object. I could see a pocket of light, some 10 to 15 feet in diameter and 30 to 40 feet long, and was surprised to find the sphere seemed to be rotating rapidly as it went along. It made a rapid calculation and concluded that the sphere was actually 300 feet away, as it seemed.

Then it was only a foot or two in diameter, not much larger than a basketball. My next thought was whether one of the radio jamming parachutes had somehow or other got attached to the plane by the string; obviously the brilliance, as seen by an electric light, can be quite startling. But it had been nearly half an hour since the last parachute, and the meteorologists were just getting ready to lower another through the trap. I decided to call the meteorologist immediately to look at the thing. But before I could tell him, the object suddenly took off at top speed and disappeared."

Now I was really concerned. In less than two seconds the UFO had vanished over the coast of Siberia, some 300 miles away. It must have been traveling at the fantastic speed of more than 1,000 miles a second. The Korean War was over but our relations with the Soviet Union were still tense, and I wondered if the object might be Russian missile on reconnaissance. I kept my eyes glued to the point where the saucer had disappeared and suddenly a couple of minutes later, it shot back toward the plane, more brilliantly than before.

You can perhaps imagine my relief when I suddenly realized what the object was, and at the same time realized that I had hit on the answer to a great many flying-saucer reports of a similar nature. Only someone familiar with the constellations could have identified the object. It was a mirage of Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens, actually slightly below the horizon at this time, but the bending of the light had raised the image above the horizon and had diffused the beam into the saucer form. The flashing and the apparent structure, including the pulsing properties, resulted from distortion by the earth's atmosphere.

"But why had the image taken off at first?" it did, and then rushed back?The moving plane of course was continually changing position relative to the ground features. A mirage peak on the distant horizon had briefly come between the plane and the star, obscuring the light. The light was cut off all at once, however. This abrupt disappearance, as though it were being switched away, seemed to give it the effect of zooming off. This temporary barrier also explained the sudden stops and starts and the tremendous acceleration the object seemed to make at the instant it appeared. The large atmospheric lens was simply focusing the light of the star in the general direction of the plane and thus it was centered with my eye. That is why the object seemed to duplicate the motions of the plane.

I watched the object for several minutes after its return. I was able to set full confirmation of this identification when the star rose over the western horizon. It rose in the west because the upward motion of the plane more than compensated for the westward motion caused.
