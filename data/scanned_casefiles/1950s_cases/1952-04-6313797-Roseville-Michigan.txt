PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

On 28 April 1952, at 0900 hours, Mr. [redacted], Roseville, Michigan, Phone [redacted], called the undersigned and reported the following information relative to sighting of unconventional aircraft:

• On 27 April 1952, at 1600 hours, [redacted] was in the backyard of his home at the above address with [redacted].

They were engaged in pitching horseshoes, and occasionally would watch jet aircraft as they flew over. At 1615 hours they observed in the northwest sky a round object, silver in color, high in the sky. It appeared to remain motionless. All four men saw the object. A pair of high-powered binoculars were obtained and the round object was brought under observation. It was observed to turn completely over and assumed an oval or egg shape. The object had a dark metallic, it is noted, brownish color was a door or a painted side. It seemed to drop straight down and then stop.

Two other similar objects, large, were then seen in the same area. It appeared that they came from the ball object, or just appeared in the same area as the ball object when it was under observation. Those objects suspended in space and at approximately 1700 hours all disappeared. The ball object going straight up and one of the cigar-shaped objects traveling up in an easterly direction and the other going up in a westerly direction. The speed of ascent was amazing, and in a small fraction of the time they were gone from sight, the objects observed were in view from 1615 to 1700 hours by all men visually, with the naked eye and binoculars.

During the observation of those three objects, another object was observed. It was a silver, cigar-shaped object traveling at a tremendous speed northwest. It was at a great altitude, no sound was heard. It was observed through binoculars and the naked eye. The observer had to be turned as the tracked the object to keep it in view. It traveled horizontally at a great altitude and speed.

There was no formation evidenced by any of these objects, no trail or exhaust, nor was any noise heard. The objects were all above job aircraft flying in the local area. The sky was clear, the observations were made during daylight for a period of approximately 45 minutes. No estimate as to altitude, distance or speed could be given, no photographs were taken. The sky was cloudless.

Mr. [redacted] asserting he had been in service, as well as the other men who observed these objects. There were no unusual meteorological phenomena present according to the observers, and he assured from the movement and the altitude of the objects that they were not weather balloons nor aircraft.

The undersigned has evaluated this information F-O in view of the fact that the undersigned does not know the reliability of the source nor has no way to judge the truth, credibility or probability of the information.
