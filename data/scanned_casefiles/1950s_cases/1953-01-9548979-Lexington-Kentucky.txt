(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

DATE: February 28, 1953

When I first observed the oval-shaped object, it seemed small and vaguely defined. In between 5 & 10 seconds, it grew larger, as though approaching, and became sharp and clear in shape and color.

The light from the object was steady. No wobbling motion was apparent.

At first it was in the N.E. After seeming to approach, it ceased to increase in brilliance and size. It then moved slowly across the sky (keeping at the same distance from the horizon) to the S.E.

This movement took about 30 seconds.
It stopped in the S.E., slowly grew
smaller, as if moving away; became very
vague in shape; then faded out com-
pletely. This fading out process took
between 5 and 10 seconds.
Shortly before and sometime after
observing the object I saw the moon.
The moon was not in the same direction
as the object, was not at the same
height above the horizon, and did not
have the same shape or color.
The direction of the movement of
the object was almost the opposite of
the wind direction at that time.

1 FEBRUARY 1953 SIGHTINGS

The document appears to be a table with columns for Location, Observer, and Evaluation. The locations include various cities and states such as Syracuse, New York; Minot, North Dakota; Saratoga Springs, New York; Atlantic Ocean; Rosalia, Washington; Hokkaido, Japan; and others.

The "Observer" column seems to have some names or identifiers blacked out, with most observers listed as "Military Air" or "Ground".

The "Evaluation" column contains entries like "Astro (CONFLICTING DATA)", "Astro (VENUS)", "Balloon", "Other (AIRCRAFT)", and similar categorizations.

The document appears to be a summary of UFO sightings from February 1, 1953, compiled by what seems to be a military or government agency.
