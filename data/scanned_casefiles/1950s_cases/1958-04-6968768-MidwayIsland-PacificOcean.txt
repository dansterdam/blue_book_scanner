11. LT JG Jesse W. Melvin Jr. 1563914, USN, Air Route Traffic and Approach
Control Officer prepared this report.

Comments:

No outstanding observations on the station at the time of the sighting and
none of the above mentioned individuals had any knowledge of an actual
sighting any prior to this or unidentified flying object. A thorough check
was made with the officer-of-the-day, the flying activities, central
military watch section, and other available sources. Negative reports
were received from all sources as to sighting or unidentified lights or objects.

I cannot identify the light or object reported sighted. I have known
USFN for nearly a year and have played class often with him including
in two station chess tournaments. There is a very reliable person and
a person I believe who would not report something unless it was true. It
is my belief that something and something, however, be investigated
and either in the record in the investigation or in the record of this
415 no record of this light or object.

25 April 1958

At approximately 0430K on 25 April I got up to give the baby her bottle which had fallen on the floor. I was on my hands and knees looking for the bottle when I noticed a sudden flare of light outside. There is a street lamp on a telephone pole across the road from the house. I thought that maybe the lamp was rocking in the wind. I looked up and saw a bright bluish white light in the sky right the street lamp. I thought that it was the landing light of an aircraft and stood up to watch it. After a few seconds I saw that the light was apparently motionless. I then thought of a parachute flare.

The light was very clear and distinct even though I did not have on my glasses. I am rather near-sighted and have astigmatism and should wear my glasses constantly. I returned to my bedroom momentarily for my glasses.

After watching the light for several minutes I noted the time as 0435K. I considered the light unusual and decided to try a simple experiment to see if the light was moving. I placed my nose on one of the vertical cloth strips on the vertical blinds. Toward was another strip of cloth on the other side of the blinds directly in front of the first. I could easily see the light with one eye on each side of the cloth strip. After a couple of minutes the light momentarily disappeared. Apparently closing my eye I determined that the light had shifted several degrees to the left. The front cloth strip prevented my seeing it with my right eye. A couple of minutes later the object reappeared several degrees to the right of its original position. I watched the light until approximately 0400K.

At this time I heard my wife crying and talking in her sleep. I returned to our bedroom to waken her and comfort her. I told her what I had seen but she wanted to sleep.

At approximately 0445 I returned to the baby's room to watch the object. It had moved considerably from its original position. After several seconds I settled it moving inland and almost ready to disappear inland over the edge of the roof. I ran downstairs and outdoors. The light was moving slowly inland while rising rapidly. At approximately 0450K I could no longer see the light. It appeared overhead at an extreme altitude.

While the light was moving inland, I noted 2 "marker lights" moving in a peculiar pattern. I appeared close to the right side and even with the top edge of the light. It moved to the left. When it was directly over the large light another marker light appeared on the right. Both lights moved slowly to the left and disappeared. 10 or 15 seconds later the cycle was repeated. The cycle lasted to about 15 seconds. After a couple of minutes I have looked at a chart of Sand Island. The original sighting was bearing about (?)300 from my quarters, ENH 16-A. I estimated the distance as 1 to 2 miles and the altitude about 4,000 or 5,000 feet. While moving inland the light was fading about 0450. The inclination of the light when it disappeared was 650 or 700.

The wind direction was 125° and the velocity 9 knots. I noted that the stars were clearly visible and the sky clear. This was to the west and in the area overhead where the light disappeared. I did not look elsewhere.

The light was a steady (faint-white) color like some (fluorescent) lights. No flaring, sparks or trails were noted. Neither was my fuselage or other shape than the 3 point lights noted. The circumference of the large light was about the intensity of the light. The 2 small lights had a peculiar pattern.


- page 7 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

distinct cases apart when they passed over the Large Light. Then they sort of fidel out due to their lesser intensity.

The only inside light was the orange glow from a heater in the baby's room.
I burned it off when I went to get my glasses. The only outside lights were the street lamp and the reflection from the rotating beacon.

Aerology did not have a weather balloon up in the area, nor did I notice any aircraft.

I would not have noticed this object except for the first brilliant flash.
No sounds or other unusual occurrences were noted.

Since I was not dressed at the time, do not yet have a home telephone, and did not want to take the time to get dressed for fear that I might miss something, I did not notify anyone at the time but my wife.

Due to the peculiar movements of the little lights, the following shape has suggested itself to me:

April 26, 1958

I Jerry L. West AN, USN saw on the 25th of April between 0930 and 0630 an object in the sky that I couldn't describe. I went through a strange procedure of examining colors. When I first saw it, it seemed to be about 49 or 50 miles out. Then in motion gradually. And during this time it was changing colors. First from a real bright seeming to fluorescent light to a glowing hot light, then to a Navy blue color. I watched it for about (40) minutes and at the end of this time it had moved to a distance of about a mile to a mile and a half from west end of runway 6-24. And after that I really watched it lose its way in more minutes and it seemed like it didn't move anymore. But I kept on seeing it again. And after that I didn't identify it completely.

[Typed text, partially illegible due to image quality]

At approximately 1530W it was extremely low, but at this time it commenced falling until
Highway was about 1,000 yards station.

At approximately 1530W a mosquito type of plane was experienced. It resembled the sound similar then a
vacuum cleaner in a curve. It was a very low ceiling.

Wake and lasted about thirty seconds on each occurrence. This inter-
ference was caused at about 1630 and continued for about 30 minutes.
During the three months I worked Air to Ground with this is a first oc-
currence with interference of this type.
