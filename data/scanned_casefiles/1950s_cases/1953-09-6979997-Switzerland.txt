REMARKS: (General description of what you saw - use back if necessary)
When it disappeared on the horizon, it required a tenth of a second from front to end. At the last moment one could see, lightning-like, the upper edge slip onto the lower edge; about one-eighth the width at the back. In spite of the enormous speed, it was still 2,000 times less than that of light, that is, only interplanetary.
