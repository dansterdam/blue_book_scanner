BOWLING GREEN STATE UNIVERSITY
BOWLING GREEN, OHIO

11 November 1957

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting

Air Defense Command
Ent Air Force Base
Colorado Springs, Colorado

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2, the following report is submitted by an Air Science Cadet at this detachment:

"On 7 November 1957 at 5:45 P.M. I Cadet left the city of Bowling Green, Ohio and proceeded on Route 6 headed for Clyde, Ohio. As I approached the first 90 degree curve on Route 6, about five miles from Bowling Green, I was observing the horizon and noticed something directly ahead. Immediately upon coming out of the curve, I spotted what appeared to be an object, bright silver and round in shape, approximately 35 degrees with the horizon. The object was white and as it moved upward at an angle of about 45 degrees, it turned to a brilliant silvery-white color. As it continued on its way around the next curve, I went straight ahead and stopped my car at a drop sign and proceeded to watch this object. It was dusk outside and the approximate time was about 6:00 P.M.

When I first approached the object, which I estimated to be about 1,000 feet in height, it was white and as it made an arc slightly to the south, it became a brilliant silvery-white in color. Then as it moved further south, the light became broader and more defined. The light coming from the object was much brighter than the sun and it seemed to be similar to that of a lightning flash except that it lasted for a definite period of time. There seemed to be no definite time interval between flashes of light and there appeared to be no definite time between flashes. At times the interval between flashes were longer than before.

I then turned my car around and drove to the Golden Lily, a gasoline station and bar combined, which is located just off the side of the road adjacent to where I had asked a couple of fellows if they wanted to see something interesting. The time of this was approximately 6:10 P.M. Two of them rode back to the spot with me and watched the object until it was out of sight. After charting my position on a map, I concluded that the object did not have any brilliant red flashing lights, nor trail, nor exhaust that could be seen, just a brilliant, red flashing light.

I then continued on my way towards Clyde, Ohio on Route 6, about two miles west of Rollersville. I noticed another brilliant red flashing light, the same kind as before. I was directly east and sighted the object out of my right rear view mirror."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a written report or document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting in Bowling Green, Ohio on November 11, 1957.

Mr. BOSU, Bowling Green, Ohio, 11 Nov 57, Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects (Cont'd)
the windshield directly in front of me. The object appeared to be about 45 degrees at my position with the horizon. It appeared to be coming downward slowly and to have a definite flight pattern. The time elapsed from start to light of the object due to the light of oncoming cars was lost sight of the object and didn't see it again.
I arrived in Clyde, Ohio around 7:00 P.M. I went directly to my girlfriend's home, which is about 12 miles from the city limits on Route 20. 
I decided to go back to Clyde and get some oil for my car before all the gasoline stations closed. I drove out the door, I saw another one of these brilliant flashing objects. It was very easy to observe the object, but because of the darkness of night and partly due to the house and the brilliant, red flashing light coming from it, it seemed to me that the light was brighter from the top of the object than from the bottom of it.
When I first noticed the object, it was in a northeastern position continued north and then proceeded northwest. It did not have any definite flight pattern but kept moving up and down around and about. There is a Turnpike Plaza three miles north of the city of Clyde and from the light I could see my girlfriend's house was a long way behind the object. As I drove closer toward Clyde, the object moved farther and farther away toward Sandusky Bay; the light was still very brilliant. I then directed my line of vision toward Clyde and saw another one of these objects.
I could see that this one was moving because in my line of sight it was going and I observed the object move behind the trees. I would look at one for a while, lose sight of it and look at the other one. At times I turned my head fast enough, I could see both of them flashing. Finally the first one disappeared in what seemed to be clouds very far away. The second, moving behind the trees, also disappeared in the direction of the city of Clyde. The first object I observed for about three to four minutes.

From my observation, this is to my best of knowledge an accurate report of my experience.
