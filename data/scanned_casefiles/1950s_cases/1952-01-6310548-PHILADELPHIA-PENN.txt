2. In an interview on 27 February 1952, Dr. CHARLES FEDERER OLIVIER, Director, Astronomical Observations, University of Pennsylvania, furnished the following information:

At approximately 1817 hours on 29 January 1952 a FIRE-BALL was observed in the sky over Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This meteor was blue-green in color with a short trail. He stated that the brilliancy averaged to be that of a quarter-moon. Its visibility lasted approximately 10 to 12 seconds at which time it disappeared, not less than 50 nor more than 100 miles distant from the observer. This general phenomenon was of a powerful nature and the fragments to have fallen as meteorite.

Dr. OLIVIER stated that he had received approximately 150 reports from individuals regarding this incident. These reports have been in the form of phone calls, letters, etc., as a result of which requests have been received for additional information of the phenomenon.

SUBJECT: Green Fire Balls Reported over Phila., Pa. 29 Jan 52
SPECIAL INQUIRY

BALL or METEOR inasmuch as he has "worked up numerous cases of instances of this type".

Mr. OLIVIER advised that a report of this incident will be published in a scientific journal by UNISALI and that the report will be contained in a publication known as the "Project Astronomipal Observatory" of the University.

The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin of 30 January 1952 carried the following article on the front page:
SEE A BIG METEOR? TELL IT TO ASTRONOMER
If you saw a meteor falling to the north of Philadelphia last night, Dr. CHARLES P. OLIVIER, director of the Flower Observatory, wants to hear about it.
Several persons reported seeing the phenomenon about 6:15. Some described it as a huge ball of blue and red flame. Others said the ball was green with yellow "tails". All agreed it seemed to be falling straight towards the earth.
Dr. OLIVIER, who is president of the American Meteor Society, said he had no first-hand knowledge of the matter. But he said he would like to hear by letter from those who say they saw it.
On 27 February 1952, Lt. A. T. MCHIG, Intelligence Division, Police Department of Philadelphia, advised Special Agent PIGOOD B. FETT, Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Philadelphia, Pa., were concerned and both advised their respective offices had received no reports of the fire balls.

This case is RUC.
