Reference is made to your Telecon TT-13, CASE Item 7, 12 February 1952. Object mentioned is green fireball type of phenomena. ATIC has been attempting to get further info on that conclusion were reached by the AF Cambridge Research Laboratory this issue a study of this phenomena. They have submitted a report to the Directorate of Research and Development in Washington, but we have been unable to get a copy of the report.

Mr. Lahos is a well known authority on meteorites. We have no info on his other than that he is technically qualified and that he assisted the GRF in 1947 and 1948 during the first outbreak of green fireballs in New Mexico. He is not working for ATIC, nor any Air Force agency as far as we know. It is believed that his extreme interest in the green fireballs is purely scientific in that he is head of the Department of Meteorites at the University of New Mexico. ATIC does not contemplate any action on this sighting.

      Dayton, Ohio

1. Reference is made to telephone message received from Major JOHN F. O'CONNELL, your office, at 0950 hours on 27 February 1952, requesting the accounts of information concerning a report that green fire-balls had been seen flying over Philadelphia on 29 January 1952.

2. In an interview on 27 February 1952, Dr. CHARLES POLLARD OLIVIER, Director, Astronomical Observations, University of Pennsylvania, furnished the following information:

At approximately 1817 hours on 29 January 1952 a FIRE-BALL, better known as a meteor, appeared over Northeastern Pennsylvania. This meteor was blue-green in color with great unanimity by the observers. He stated that the brilliancy averaged to be that of a quarter moon. Its visibility lasted approximately 10 to 12 seconds at which time it disintegrated not less than 50 nor more than 100 miles Northwest of Philadelphia. The general phenomena gave a strong indication that the end point was a low enough for fragments to have fallen as meteorites.

Dr. OLIVIER stated that he had received approximately 450 reports from persons from Massachusetts to Maryland. These reports have been in the form of phone calls, letters, etc., of which approximately one-third have real scientific information of value.

Dr. OLIVIER stated that he did not personally observe this meteor nor was it observed by anyone from the University of Pennsylvania Observatories. Dr. OLIVIER stated that there is no doubt that the phenomena was that of a brilliant FIRE-

BALL or meteor inasmuch as he has "worked up numerous
cases of instance of this type".

Dr. OLIVIER advised that a report of this incident
will be published in a scientific journal by himself and
that the report will be contained in a publication known
as the "Flower Astronomical Observatory" of the University
of Pennsylvania.

3. The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin of 30 January 1952 carried the
following article on the front page:

SEE A BIG METEOR? TELL IT TO ASTRONOMER

If you saw a meteor falling to the north of Philadelphia
last night, Dr. CHARLES P. OLIVIER, Director of the Flower
Observatory, Upper Darby, would like to hear from you.

Several persons reported seeing the phenomenon about
6.15. Some described it as a huge ball of blue and red
flame. Others said the ball was green with yellow "tails".
All agreed it seemed to be falling straight towards the
earth.

Dr. OLIVIER, who is president of the American Meteor
Society, said he had no first-hand knowledge of the meteor.
But he said he would like to hear by letter from those who
did, with a description of what they saw.

4. On 27 February 1952, Lt. A. T. McTAIG, Intelligence Division,
Police Department, City of Philadelphia and Special Agent ELWOOD E.
FEIT, Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Philadelphia,
Pa., were contacted and both advised that their respective offices had
received no reports of the fire ball.
