AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO. TR-1-52

Report of Unidentified Object

AREA MONITORED: War Point Conception, California

DATE OF REPORT: 19 April 1952     DATE OF INFORMATION: 24 March 1952     EVALUATION: A-2

PREPARED BY (Officer): 2 Lt John F. McGrew, Operational Intel.     ORGANIZATION: 102nd Bomb Squadron

SUMMARY:
The following is a statement submitted by Lt Hancock, Radar Observer, 102nd Bomb Squadron, on 25 March 1952:

"While on a routine mission on 24 March 1952, I observed on the ARC 13 radar scope a return which I was unable to identify. My observation was verified by Lt Long, the Navigator on our crew, and he also ascertained that this object offered a clear and distinct radar return. The return first appeared on the scope at 1645 Z am. as observed for between 20-30 seconds. Its speed was calculated at 3000 ft/H. Observation was by electronic means. We were flying: a 270 degree course, pressure altitude of 25,000. Our course was 270 degrees. Our position at the time of incident was 34 degrees, 30 minutes North; 121 degrees 30 minutes West which is 60 miles west of Point Conception. California. The object first appeared SE of us and was travelling N.W. at an altitude of less than 25,000'.

I, as Radar Observer, personally witnessed this return as did the Navigator.

Neither conditions CAA. No physical evidence is available.

Both officers concerned with this sighting have had combat experience and are regarded as highly reliable officers.

Though no shape could be reported by these officers, either definite sighting of a rapidly moving, unidentified object or possible electronic activity brought about by gun firing (which would give trace indication on radar scope) is indicated."
