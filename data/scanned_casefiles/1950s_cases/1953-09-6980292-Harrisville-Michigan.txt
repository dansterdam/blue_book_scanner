AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

63rd Ptr Intcp Sq Intell. Off.
Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Mich.

Verbal Interview with Mr. [redacted]
Bay City, Michigan on 29 September 1959.

"I am a lumber operator see. Have my own mill and we build houses in Bay City. We have 2½ boys up near Algens County. A friend of mine over in 2½ miles East of Harrisville and 2½ miles South. We don't operate until the farmers get through working so I go over there and help him with his bean crop. He was hauling in beans yesterday afternoon - I went over about 11 o'clock and helped him turn over some beans. Of course this hasn't got anything to do with it in a way and in a way it has too. So on the second load ending up he pulled south, I don't know if this is south here or not - and he made a big circle, in this beveled and the barn is east. Fairly part a big silo - it is quite a big farm and store right in front of the barn to put the beans in there. Well he was up arriving, you know when you get on a load of hay when you are not too showing beans. Normally I was down at rest. I was landing, about 20 degrees, on the beans you know. I looked up and right in the sky there was a bright object and I says to this fellow, the farmer name is [redacted] says I don't see it. He says I don't see it either. Just then, he looked over that way and I was still looking over there. He says there it is but from the time he said I can't see one it was about two seconds. I figured that taking the about 5 miles away or maybe more in two seconds. See I figured - got the speed and directional. When it come down this way I couldn't see it but I seen it when it banked like that was that's when I definitely saw, the man see a big circle. It just gets big real quick, see straightened out and when he seen it, it backed again and so see it again, and it must have went that way so they made a north course answer."

REPORT NO.
PAGE 2 OF 2

see a thing like that you don't have time to think about it but when that
thing is moving level you can't see it only when it is in the sun, just
like a moon.

Question - Well then it gave two definite turns, one heading to the south, is that right?
Answer - Yes, when it banked it went southerly.

Question - Originally when you saw it, it was heading south?
Answer - No I couldn't tell - but it must have been coming from the north for when it
banked it banked southeasterly different and banked again and we saw the
bottom and went directly east. Like it was a left angle turn.

Question - How definite banks and each of these banks you sighted the object?
Answer - Over the turbulent one - I couldn't judge the distance very well. As it went
on an angle but I would judge it was five miles or more. The time it took to
get that far I jumped up to the back of the wagon and I seen that. For about
two seconds and it disappeared and he says "I don't see it." And I said
"there it is" that was two seconds, that is how I arrived at the speed, of
course I may be off a little bit too short the speed itself. I judge
according to my watch how long it takes to say that and that would be ninety
- 150 miles per minute and 60 minutes 9000 miles. This is a little bit off.

Question - You didn't notice anything else about the appearance of the object except it
was round and was built of a shiny material evidentially?
Answer - I couldn't even see without that bottom was flat or that it came down like
a funnel. It was so bright that it hurt my eyes - just like looking into the
sun.

Question - Just exactly what time was this?
Answer - 3 PM. QMdls was in the afternoon and the sun was over your shoulder?
Answer - Right back of me because the last load we brought in the sun seemed to go right
down over the road east. As we got in as we got 1/2 or 1/4 of a mile we got
down - afraid it would rain you know.

Question - You say that you were two miles West of Harrisville and two miles South?
Answer - Yes. Almost directly west of Sanborn cemetery. I call it so many - I know
so many where it came out. The road doesn't go through that it
where it came out.

Question - You say some other man with noticed this thing, what is
his name?
