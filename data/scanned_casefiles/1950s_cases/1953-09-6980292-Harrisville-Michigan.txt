The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an aeronautical chart supply document, providing instructions and information related to the use of aeronautical charts.

AERONAUTICAL CHART SUPPLY
To insure that the airman has the latest information available, U.S. World Aeronautical Charts are revised at six-month intervals and the Airman's World Aeronautical Charts are revised at three-month periods. Chart users are advised to check the list Dates of Latest Prints on display with authorized agents.

CITY CHART SUPPLY
Authorized agents for the sale of aeronautical charts have been appointed at certain airports and principal cities throughout the United States. The charts may also be obtained from the Aeronautical Chart and Geodetic Survey, Washington 25, D.C.

MILITARY CHART SUPPLY
(REF: AFR 67-3)
Indexes or lists in the current edition of the "USAF Catalog of Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications" indicate what military aeronautical charts, maps and related information are available.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED
PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES
 
Verbatim record of interview with Mr. Ray Dietrich, Harrisville, Michigan on 23 September 1952.

"I am a lumber operator now. Have by own mill and we build houses in Bay City. We have large pulpwood operations in Alcona and Iosco Counties in Michigan and we also operate a sawmill in Harrisville, Michigan.

On 23 September 1952 at about 8:30 pm while I was working late at the mill in Harrisville my wife came down and said she had been observing something in the sky for the past hour or so. I immediately shut down the mill and went outside with her. She showed me the object which looked to be about the size of a car and was silver in color. It was hovering at an estimated altitude of about 1,000 feet and was motionless. I watched it for about 11 minutes and saw it start to move slowly to the north. I ran and got my truck and followed it for a short distance, watching it through my windshield, but it got away from me, moving much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. So on the second look, I could hardly keep it in sight it was moving so fast. I don't know if this is something new or a secret military aircraft, but I have never seen anything like it before in my life. When it first came into view, my wife yelled to me 'look at that thing in the sky' and I ran out and saw it hovering there. After a while, it started moving to the north and gained considerable speed. When it was up driving, you know when you see something way up in the sky, that's the way it was. I was literally out of this world, about 20 feet as far as I could tell - way up high. There was no sound at all that I could hear. I looked up and right in the sky there it was. I locked up and went to the house to call the State Police. They came out and looked but couldn't find anything."

Question - You were facing to the East?
Answer - Yes.
Question - And when you saw the object, it was directly in front of you?
Answer - No, it was southeast of the town of Harrisville, about the same direction as the mill, but a little south, I'd say. So that's where I saw it.
Question - And you said it seemed to be about the size of an automobile?
Answer - Yes, that's right. About the size of a car.
Question - And it was hovering?
Answer - Yes, it was hovering motionless at first, about 1,000 feet up.
Question - And what color was it?
Answer - It was silver in color. Shiny, metallic silver.
Question - And did it make any sound as you observed it?
Answer - No, I didn't hear any sound at all. It was absolutely silent.
Question - And how long did you observe it?
Answer - I'd say I watched it for about 11 minutes before it started moving off to the north.
Question - And which way did it go?
Answer - It went off to the north. I ran and got my truck and followed it for a little while, but it got away from me very quickly, moving much faster than any aircraft I've ever seen.
Question - Did you notice anything unusual about the object's motion or speed?
Answer - Well, the main thing was the speed. When it took off to the north, it gained a tremendous amount of speed in a very short time. I could hardly keep it in sight, it was moving so fast.
Question - Did you notice anything about the outline or shape of the object?
Answer - No, the main thing that stood out was the silver color and the fact that it was hovering motionless at first. The shape was hard to make out clearly.
Question - Did you get the impression of any structural details or protrusions?
Answer - No, I didn't notice anything like that. It just looked like a smooth, silvery object.
Question - Did you notice any exhaust or trail of any kind?
Answer - No, no exhaust or trail at all. It was just silently hovering and then took off at tremendous speed.
Question - Did you notice any lights on the object?
Answer - No, I didn't see any lights. It was just a silvery, metallic object.
Question - Did the object appear to rotate or change position in any way?
Answer - No, not that I noticed. It was just hovering motionless at first, and then took off to the north.
Question - Was the weather clear at the time?
Answer - Yes, the sky was clear. No clouds or anything.
Question - Did you report this sighting to anyone else besides the State Police?
Answer - No, I just called the State Police right away after I lost sight of it.
Question - Did you notice anything unusual about the time of the sighting, such as electrical or radio interference?
Answer - No, I didn't notice anything like that. Everything seemed normal, except for the object itself.
Question - Is there anything else you can add about your observations?
Answer - No, I think I've covered the main details. It was just a very strange and unexpected thing to see. I've never seen anything like it before or since.
