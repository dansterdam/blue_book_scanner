SUMMARY (Give main points in first paragraph. Indicate if report is final, preliminary, etc. Cite last report on AF Form 112—Part II)

At 0950 EST, Lt Jr R Zeitvogel pilots a Navy GBU at 6000 feet, approximately 15 miles northeast of Mitchel Field. He noticed an unconventional object between his aircraft and Mitchel Field at an altitude a greater to 20 to 20 miles. When the object appeared to move, it Zeitvogel gave chase but it seemed to elude him at a high rate of speed and climb, outpacing him until it disappeared approximately two and one half miles later.

Significance: The object was in a limited measure comparable to a balloon, a balloon was released at approximately this time, and the motion apparent between two airborne objects is extremely deceptive. In lieu of more precise information, the report remains a mystery.

1. Description:
   a. Shape: circular shape, in a horizontal plane, pancake shaped or similar
      to an open parachute in the vertical plane.

   b. Size: Estimated twenty to fifteen feet in diameter, height about one-third
      of the diameter in the horizontal plane.

   c. Color: Navy light, on a dull or light wavelength carrying on the upper surface.
      Due to the light reflection was a very light gray or white. Seemed to
      vary well. However, he could not determine that the underside was a darker
      color.

   d. Number: One no formation.

   e. No apparent aerodynamic features such as wings, tail or any means of control.

   f. Trail or exhaust: none apparent.

   g. Propulsion system: none apparent.

   h. Exhaust: none apparent.

   i. Speed: Then first sighted, estimated at 300 knots, when circling Mitchell
      AFB the object second to be spotted, up. When last sighted believed object
      was doing at least 700 knots. While at Mitchell, object circled Mitchell
      was able to fly fairly close by circling on the inside. He was doing 160
      knots and by comparing the speed for his own, the estimated 500 knots seemed
      reasonable to him.

   j. Sound: None.

   k. Maneuvers: Tight turns, south of Mitchell before he came back to Mitchell.

   l. Manner of disappearance: The object disappeared about seven miles away and
      after reaching an altitude greater than the ceiling, then at 6000 feet.

   m. Other pertinent features: While flying level, making gaining or losing
      altitude, the object seemed to have a rocking or oscillating motion.

   n. Time sighted: Approximately 0850 EST.

   o. Length of time observed: Two and one half minutes (approx).

   p. Number of observations: Visual from 10 to 15°. Speed: 150 knots, Altitude 6000 ft.

   q. Type of aircraft: Transair TLSQ3 Naval Aircraft.

   r. Location of observer during sighting: North Point of the ceiling.

   s. Location of object and its relative movement: 8° (SE) Roger Zeltweg 90888 USS, Naval Aviation,
      attached to Navy Squadrons Patrol Wing Eleven, Port Washington, N.Y. Flying experience
      eight years flying in Navy. Total pilot time approximately 1000 hours. No
      other witnesses. Lt Zeltweg seems rational, intelligent and reliable.

STATEMENT

21 January 1952

The following is a statement made by Lt. James R. Zeitvogel, USN, 304288, made in connection with the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

"At about 0950, 21 January 1952, while flying at 9000 feet, approxi- mately range (5) miles southwest of Mitchell Air Force Base, I sighted an unknown object about one and a half (1½) miles from the end of runway 30. (This was almost directly between my aircraft and Mitchell Air Force Base.)

At time of sighting, the object was on a heading of southwest (about 210°), speed about 500 knots.

The object as seen from above and from the side appeared to be oval in shape, very much like an open parachute canopy. Estimated diameter 20 to 30 feet. The object appeared to move at 200 or 300 feet altitude. After reaching a point about 3 or 4 miles south of Mitchell AFB, the object commenced a turn to port and appeared to increase speed. After completing his turn a steady of north, the object proceeded to circle Mitchell, in a counter clockwise direction, staying approx- imately two (2) miles from the field perimeter and maintaining altitude. Upon reaching a point two (2) or three (3) miles north- west of Mitchell the object straightened out on a heading of approximately 210° and climbed rapidly. No estimates of its rate of climb was possible; however his flight path seemed to be taking him up at an angle of about 10° above the horizontal. Last seen the object was on this course and at an altitude of between 5,000 and 10,000 feet at a point approximately six (6) or seven (7) miles southwest of Mitchell Air Force Base.
