1. The following information is in confirmation of information furnished generally to your command on 17 June 1954, and, also, to facilitate compliance by your command in accordance with instructions outlined in Paragraph 9, AFL 200-5.

2. On 18 June 1954, at approximately 1250 hours, this office was requested by the Provost Marshal, Air Force Missile Test Center, to contact the Air Force Missile Test Center Intelligence Officer, regarding the sighting of unidentified flying objects near Indialantic, Florida.

3. On 18 June 1954, Major G. C. SHALLOT, Intelligence Branch, AFMTC, advised that on 18 June 1954, Mr. Williams, NAS Services, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, had reported that at 2130 hours, 18 June 1954, while looking out over the Atlantic Ocean, East of Jeptha's Hall, Indialantic, Florida. The watcher was conversant, with intermittent observers. An intense white beam, bright clear, a flashlight beam, was particularly noted shining from a point of approximately 100 yards offshore. The light flashes lasted for approximately four (4) seconds and were visible for approximately 10 cycles. After an experience of three (3) minute interval, the lights began to cycle again for approximately 10 cycles. The light was turned on the spotlight of his automobile and directed two small (40) feet of water in the 12-15 area. The light cycling and catching could be seen. The lights did not reoccur after the spotlight was turned off. A check of the local charts and tides indicates approximately 12-15 feet of water in the area of the occurrence at the time.
