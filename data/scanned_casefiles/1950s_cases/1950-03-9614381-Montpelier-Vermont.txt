AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Flying Objects
USA

11 April 1950                                                                   March 1950

Report contains information on seven alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects forwarded by various LMTS Flight Service Center units. The sightings were all in the US and occurred during March 1950.

APPROVED:
JOSEPH G. HALER
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Intelligence Division

G. Two unidentified objects were observed at 1300B on 22 March 1950 over Montpelier, Vermont. The observer was Mr. [redacted], a restaurant operator of Barre, Vermont.

Mr. [redacted] stated that he saw an aircraft at high altitude. Three or four vapor trails were noted in the plane's wake. Mr. [redacted] thought that the aircraft was a B-36-type. The observer declared that two other objects "about the size of bowling balls" appeared to be flying in formation with the aircraft. Cossi also said that the objects appeared to break up cirrus clouds through which they passed. The color of the objects was white and they were on 330° heading. No estimate of their speed was given. No photographs or sketches were made of the objects; no exhaust trail nor sound were noted.

The original setting by Mr. [redacted] was transmitted from the Montpelier Radio Range Station to Boston Control (GC) who relayed it to the Flight Service Center, Middletown, Pennsylvania at 1345E.

Comments of Olmsted Flight Service Centers: The weather at the time of observation was 25,000 feet scattered clouds, visibility at 25 miles.

Kentaehle Held had a modified B-29 (AF 791) on a three hour test hop at approximately 1300B, 22 March 1950. The flight was between Lake Winnipesaukee and Lake George and was at an altitude of 25,000 feet. It is possible that this was what Mr. Cossi saw. Reflection from the aircraft may have given the impression of flying objects in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft.
