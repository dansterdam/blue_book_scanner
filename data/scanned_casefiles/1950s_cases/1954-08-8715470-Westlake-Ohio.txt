1. The following, received from the Cleveland Detachment of this
District Office, is forwarded for your information:

On 5 August 1954, Mr. [redacted], Avon Lake, Ohio, ([redacted], Metal
Equipment Co., [redacted], Cleveland, Ohio) telephonically advised Special Agent HENRY J. FISHER that he
had sighted an object in the sky on 2 August 1954.

On 5 August 1954, Special Agent FISHER interviewed Mr. [redacted] at his residence. [redacted] advised that he
sighted an object in the sky at 1717 hours, 2 August 1954,
which appeared to be southwest of Lorain, Ohio. At the
point of sight, [redacted] advised that he was at the intersection of State Route 254 and Dover Center Road, Westlake, Ohio. The object appeared to be the size of approximately fifty (50) seconds of an arc in diameter or about the size of a shirt button. [redacted] stated that the shape of the object was somewhat elliptical and appeared to be very bright, like highly polished metal. There was no evidence
of chromatic dispersion and the object was very clean in
appearance, with no distortion. [redacted] stated that the
object was at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and
seemed to be hovering. He stated that he saw the object
in this position for five (5) to eight (8) seconds, when
it suddenly dropped vertically and came to an abrupt halt
at approximately 2,000 feet. [redacted] advised that the descent took approximately three (3) seconds. The object
remained in its new position for ten (10) seconds and then
disappeared. [redacted] stated that the object faded out
of sight and likened its disappearance to a TV set being
turned off.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

[Redacted name] related that the object, when sighted, appeared to be six (6) miles from his position, and stated that when the object dropped, it appeared to be a free fall rather than an accelerated drop. When the object dropped, it appeared to change as though it had its thin side towards the observer. He stated the object had no noticeable surface characteristics, and that its descent to 2,000 feet was a definite action and not a floating or wobbling motion. He liked the speed of the object to that of a ME 109 fighter plane approaching head-on to a B-17 in flight, magnified three (3) times, or approximately 1,000 to 1,200 miles per hour.

I advised that the day was relatively clear, with no cloud formations in the northerly direction but with some cloud formations to the south and southeast. The object's location from [redacted] point of vision was at a heading of 260 degrees.

Mr. [redacted] stated that he has never sighted any object in the sky that he could not satisfy himself with its identity. He stated that he is an amateur astronomer and is a member of the Cleveland Astronomical Society. He advised that he believes he has knowledge of what heavenly phenomena are and that this, in his opinion, was not connected with any heavenly phenomena.

[Redacted name] advised that he was a member of the Air Force from November 1942 to November 1944; that he flew as a gunner on a B-17 aircraft for eighteen (18) missions, completing nineteen (19) missions over Germany; that he had never been injured as a crew member and has never experienced fatigue in any way; and that he had at least four (4) or five (5) courses in aircraft identification.

2. No further investigative action is contemplated by this District Office in instant matter, unless specifically requested by your Command.
