VERNAL, UTAH, OCT. 10-(UP)--A WHITE OBJECT THAT "LOOKED LIKE THE MOON" AND TRAILED A BLUE FLAME WAS SIGHTED BY A MAN WHO BELIEVED IT TO HAVE CRASHED 20 TO 30 MILES EAST OF HERE SHORTLY BEFORE SUNRISE.

(705) AGM CIVIL AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION SPOKESMAN AT 4604 AM, MST, SAID SOME SMALL REPORTS OF A SIMILAR TRAIL CAME FROM POINTS SCATTERED AS FAR AS TEXAS AND SOUTH DAKOTA. SOME PERSONS REPORTED SEEING IT OVER UTAH AND SOUTHWESTERN WYOMING.

THERE WAS SOME SPECULATION THE OBJECT MIGHT BE PART OF A ROCKET THAT BIT THE RUSSIAN SATELLITE IN AN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH LATE LAST FRIDAY.

MCPHERSON, ALLEN HYNES, DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. SATELLITE TRACKING PROJECT, SAID AT BOSTON, THE WAS DOUBTFUL THAT THE TRAIL HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SATELLITE ROCKETS. HE SAID AT THE TIME OF ITS APPEARANCE CRASH, THE SATELLITE AND FORTY ROCKET WHICH IS FOLLOWING IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CIRCLING SOMEWHERE OFF SOUTH AFRICA.

THE NORTH AMERICAN AIR DEFENSE COMMAND AT COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO., SAID TODAY IT BELIEVED A HUGE FIREBALL THAT WHIRLED ACROSS THE PREDAWN SKIES OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WAS A METEOR.

COMMAND OFFICIALS SAID AN AIR FORCE INVESTIGATING TEAM WOULD BE FLOWN IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTHEASTERN UTAH SITE WHERE THE OBJECT APPARENTLY CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER 4 A.M. (7 MILE SITE).

THE COMMAND CONFIRMED REPORTS THE MYSTERIOUS FIERY OBJECT NARROWLY SIDESWEPT A NAVY PLANE IN AN AREA NEAR THE COLORADO-UTAH BORDER, BUT SAID IT COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE PILOT OR WHERE THE PLANE WAS BASED.

IT GAVE THE PLANE'S NUMBER AS "NAVY 1617."

THE COMMAND OFFICIALS JOINED SEVERAL EASTERN SCIENTISTS IN RULING OUT THE POSSIBILITY THE FIREBALL WAS PART OF THE RUSSIAN SATELLITE LAUNCHING ROCKET. OTHER MILITARY SPOKESMEN IN THIS AREA REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY IT WAS A RUN-AWAY MISSILE.

A WESTERN AIR LINES PILOT, CAPTAIN JOE SEDAY OF LOS ANGELES, SAID HE SAW THE OBJECT WHILE FLYING OVER SOUTHWESTERN WYOMING. HE SAID A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE TALKED AIR-TO-AIR BY RADIO WITH THE PILOT OF THE UNIDENTIFIED NAVY PLANE, WHICH HAD REPORTED NEAR-COLLISION WITH THE OBJECT.

YET MIGHT HAVE ANY DEFINITE INFORMATION ON THE WHOLE THING UNTIL AN AIR FORCE TEAM GETS IN THERE TO SEARCH THE AREA ON THE GROUND.

THE COMMAND'S PUBLIC INFORMATION SERVICE SAID, "WE HAVE BEEN TOLD TO ANNOUNCE THAT A FULL-SCALE INVESTIGATION IS BEING MADE."

THE COMMAND SAID IT HAD A LIST A MILE LONG OF PEOPLE WHO HAD SPOTTED THE OBJECT. SOME DESCRIBED IT AS A BRIGHT RED FIREBALL, OTHERS SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A "WHITE MOON" WITH A BLUE FLAME TAIL.

A MYSTERIOUS FIERY OBJECT SKIPPED ERRATICALLY THROUGH WESTERN PREDAWN SKIES TODAY LEAVING IN ITS WAKE A FLOOD OF VARYING REPORTS AND SPECULATION BEFORE IT REPORTEDLY CRASHED NEAR THE UTAH-COLORADO BORDER.

SOME DESCRIBED IT AS A "FIREBALL" OTHERS SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A "WHITE MOON" WITH A BLUE FLAME. SOME THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE PART OF THE RUSSIAN SATELLITE LAUNCHING ROCKET, ALTHOUGH THAT WAS VIRTUALLY RULED OUT. OTHERS THOUGHT IT WAS A METEOR OR GUIDED MISSILE GONE ASTRAY.

THE AIR DEFENSE COMMAND AT COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO, SAID THE AIR FORCE WOULD MAKE A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION OF THE FIREBALL.

AT WASHINGTON, THE AIR FORCE SAID THE FIREBALL APPEARED TO BE A METEOR.

THE FIRST REPORT CAME FROM A NAVY PILOT WHO TOLD CIVIL AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION EMPLOYES IN DENVER AND SALT LAKE CITY HE NEARLY COLLIDED WITH THE OBJECT. HE SAID HE SAW THE "FIREBALL" CRASH EAST OF VERNAL, UTAH, NEAR THE COLORADO BORDER, SHORTLY AFTER 6 A.M. EST.

THE OBJECT WAS SEEN IN SCATTERED AREAS OF TEXAS, COLORADO, WYOMING, SOUTH DAKOTA, MONTANA AND UTAH.

WITNESSES AT VERNAL SAID THEY SAW AN OBJECT THAT "LOOKED LIKE THE MOON--WHITE WITH A BLUE FLAME THAT PULSED LIKE A HEART" DISAPPEAR BEHIND LOW HILLS 20 TO 30 MILES EAST OF THE CITY. SEARCHERS WERE SENT INTO THE VICINITY IMMEDIATELY.

Lower Flight Service reported this at 1105 hrs. May saw a report from Inglewood, Cliton, a tail of two 250-300 yards long, falling rapidly north to south. At 1105, Navy aircraft 1067, 2 miles East of Kyton, Utah, East bound on Victor 176, reported either a rocket, jet or unknown object passed on his port side at an angle of 30 degrees to the earth and burned out 20 to 25 miles East of Kyton, Utah. Speed was estimated as Mach-2. At 1107 Western Airlines reported missile crossed his bow and crashed in Kyton, Iowa. At 1107 Granville, 3 AC aircraft 35,000, 37,000 and 33,000, respectively saw object and gave location of crash as Kyton, Utah. The object was higher than the aircraft but not much. Burn-out was in West-Southwest direction. Seen for 12 seconds.

Brilliant object, very large, bright green. Checked with Central and Western Force and they have a sitting aircraft. We have a site up in that area and have checked with them and they have made preliminary search and found nothing. Investigation being conducted as yet that I know of. More planned. Denver radio stations stated they had received reports from persons sighting the object.

AF Believes
'Fireball'
Was Meteor
By UNITED PRESS

The North American Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs, Colo., said today it believes a huge fireball that blazed across the western skies of five Western states was a meteor.

COMMAND officials said an Air Force investigating team went to the northeastern Utah site where the object apparently crashed early this morning.

THE COMMAND continued reports the mysterious body observed narrowly sidestepped a Navy plane in an area near the Colorado-Utah border, but could not identify the object. Its basis was based on the fact that it gave the plane's number as "Navy 1067."

Command officials joined several Eastern scientists in ruling out the possibility the fireball was part of the Russian satellite launching rocket. Their military spokesmen in the area rejected the possibility.

"This is a period of heavy meteor activity," said one Air Force spokesman at the Air Defense Command. "A shower known as 'Glockerblink' was due Dec. 4" (last night) with other this one the 13th and 23rd.

"We won't have any definite information on the whole thing until-as (Air Force team gets) in there and checks it out," the public information service said.

"I have been told to announce that a full-scale investigation is being made."

- THE INDIANAPOLIS STAR

Big Fireball Traverses
Western U.S. Sky
Denver (AP) — A brilliant
ball of fire described as large
as a house, blazed across western skies in the predawn darkness yesterday. It whizzed so
close to a Navy plane that the
pilot had to make a sharp
turn to avoid a collision.

Scientists said they are sure
the flaming object was a
meteorite and had no connection with the Russian satellite
launched last week.

The Navy transport plane
pilot, Lt. Cmdr. W. S. Farrell,
said after seeing the fireball,
which he described as a near
crash in rugged country near
the Colorado-Utah border,
Norris said he had to bank
sharply to avoid the fireball.

HEADQUARTERS of the
North American Air Defense
Command at Colorado Springs
said fliers will search the area
east of Myton, in east-central
Utah.

Airline pilots told all night
tellers all the way from North
Dakota to Utah told of seeing
the flaming sky wanderer flying at 17,000 feet or below. The plane was
flying at 17,000 feet at the
time and was three minutes
past its checkpoint at Myton,
Utah.

In addition to the crew, the
4-engine plane carried 23 passengers. No one was hurt and
the plane was not damaged.

An Air Force bomber pilot,
Lt. George Wortell of Cleveland, said he thought for a
time the fireball was on a
collision course with his plane.

"When it passed instead of
hitting us, excitement turned
to awe. The cockpit was lit
up like daylight . . . it was
a big ball of blue-white fire
only five or 10 miles away.

"It went by at a terrible
speed in a descending trajectory from about 50,000 feet,
trailing a spectacular multicolored tail. It seemed to disintegrate before it hit the ground, falling in many pieces."

Capt. R. A. Anderson, who
was in the plane's cockpit
when the fireball first was
seen, said the object came
driving out of the north.

"IT WAS A BURST, green
ball of fire," said Anderson,
senior medical officer at the
Norfolk Naval Air Station.
Anderson said the object
flashed by the left side of the
transport plane and appeared
to have burned out about 1."

METEORITE
MUSEUM
BOX 148, SEDONA, ARIZONA

December 2, 1957

Dr. Fred Whipple
Director
Astrophysical Observatory
Cambridge 36, Mass.

Dear Dr. Whipple:

Recently I made a fireball survey which revealed a situation that is frightening and I think perhaps you are the man in the best position to do something about it.

On October 10,1957, a navy pilot of Lt.Commander rank was flying from Alameda, California to Norfolk, Va. carrying military personnel. He was about 96 miles southeast of Salt Lake City when he said he saw, ahead of his left side and head, coming in a collision course so he banked his plane and circled, as he did so "the fireball disintegrated under him."

There were many sightings of this fireball from widely separated points but the North American Lockheed Goeman at Colorado Springs took the pilot's statement at par and discussed a search party to the area where the pilot said it landed. I suppose they worked on the theory that it might possibly have been a mistaken idea of a meteorite. I discussed the matter with the Colonel who was in charge of that office and who himself led the searching party. When I had dispatched the matter with him and his subordinates I was really and truly frightened though I tried not to reveal this state of mind to them. The point is now that the meteor - its head disintegrated at a point more than 150 miles from where they searched a few weeks after this event. The Colonel and his staff were in a state of complete confusion and had reached the conclusion that nothing more could be done concerning the location or nature of that object.

My survey covered points on all sides of the end point of the fireball and the only thing about which the pilot was correct was the approximation direction from which it had come. That direction was approximately the same direction from which a Russian missile would be most likely. Yet I was unable to find that our radar screen had detected anything.

Now there is no question but that this was a meteor - but that it disintegrated at an altitude above ten miles.


- page 23 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Report.

practically never 15 miles, in the area between Armen and Baku, Sibernon. The terrain was covered by a spot of snow between now and then of its arrival and the completion of my survey recce no such car or made until next summer by the region is mountain out and it is doubtful whether a search is really justified not. But that it now the point of this letter.

I am writing you because this high ranking pilot and the top officials of the North American Defense clearly reveal their ability to deal with problems of identity and one of such objects. Just like dozens of other pilots with whom I have met on similar surveys through the past 20 years they do all of the wrong things and none of the right things in attempting to report and analyse the situation. This constitutes a desperate attempt under present international conditions.

I went carefully over the many dispatches that reached the DENVER POST office concerning this fireball. Anyone who understands the meteorological neighbors could have sat there at his desk and telephone and in 10 minutes could have known positively that this was a meteorite. Some could have known the general area over which it passed and where it landed.

From now on, it appears to me that unless there is so to a processing office where all such reports will be entered as are in danger of two international catastrophes. 1) a "trial shot" could derive and the military would be unaware of its until a leading could be used by the enemy to correct their aim and literally blanket our country with atomic destruction. 2) a missile or a satellite can or predestroy mechanism be set in motion initiating a war of complete destruction.

There is no question about the lack of preparation in pilots to. Goal with this situation. I have found it almost universal. One of the chief duties of this proposed processing office, would be the proper instruction of pilots, military personnel, and forest service personnel. Our fire lookouts and control towers are of utmost importance in handling the problem, providing valuable know how.

I extremely hope you will find some means of correcting this extremely dangerous situation.

Sincerely yours,
Dr. B. H. Blininger

Mr. H. H. Nininger
The Meteorite Museum
Box 146
Sedona, Arizona

Dear Harry:

Your letter of December 2 is a very important one and I certainly share with you an eagerness of the type you describe. I shall pass along to the proper authorities a copy of your letter, with your permission, and will discuss it with them. If you wish to contribute more in alleviating the situation, I would appreciate your referring me to a good documentary account of exactly how the observations of fireballs should be made so that the proper interpretations can be reached. There is not a really good account of this that might be usable by pilots and other military personnel. I suggest that you write down a few ideas and pass them around among the various meteorite students.

I really think there is a useful field of endeavor in this direction and will cooperate in any way possible.

Hope everything is going well with you.

Sincerely,

Fred L. Whipple
Director
