UNCLASSIFIED

Roslyn
and "ANF"
0112 hours (Greenwich time), on 27 July 1956 while piloting a Pan American
World Airways aircraft on a non-stop flight across New York to Paris, France, he
sighted a pulsing light which first appeared dead ahead of the aircraft at
an unestimated distance. The light was unlike any other he had ever seen and
traveled at a speed greater than any aircraft with other
characteristics. In contact.

Shape or design, inasmuch as he described the object he can only simply
pulsing light.

[Para] 3 - The following specific information is required by paragraph 61,
AFR 210-2, dated 26 August 1953, was obtained from:

(1) Description of the object.
    (a) Shape: 1 light, generally circular in size, not elongated,
        pulsing, two or three pulses per second. Interviewed
        stated it was difficult to describe. Seemed a
        light only, and there were no tangible outlines or any
        visible object connected with the light.

    (b) Size: approximate size of a pole ball as seen, without
        making any compensation for distance between the observer
        and the light.
