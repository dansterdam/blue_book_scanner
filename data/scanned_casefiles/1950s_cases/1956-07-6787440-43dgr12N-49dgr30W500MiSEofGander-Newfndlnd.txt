"TNCLR 251R.
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPT by Lt Col Carl H. Anderson Hq USAF
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object sighted 
49 degrees 30 minutes N 46 degrees 12 minutes W about 500 miles SE of Gander, Newfoundland, on 6 July 1956.
1. At 1730 local time on 6 July 1956, a Stratocruiser aircraft of MATS, en route from Frankfurt, Germany, to McGuire AFB, N.J., sighted an unidentified flying object. The aircraft was at an altitude of 20,000 feet, approximately 500 miles SE of Gander, Newfoundland.
2. The crew members of the Stratocruiser, which was commanded by Major W.G. Tobin, reported that they sighted a bright light which they could not identify. It was moving at a high rate of speed and was estimated to be 3 to 5 miles away from the aircraft. The light was brilliant and appeared to pulsate or fluctuate in intensity. The crew stated that the light was not red, green, or white as is customary for aircraft navigation lights, and that it was much brighter and larger than normal aircraft lights. The crew members were unable to determine the exact size, shape, or altitude of the object, but they are certain that it was not a conventional aircraft. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes and then disappeared from view.
3. The following specific information is submitted as requested:
(1) Purpose and circumstances of the sighting: As stated above, the object was sighted by the crew of a MATS Stratocruiser aircraft en route from Frankfurt, Germany, to McGuire AFB, N.J.
(2) Shape, size, color, number, and location of the object(s): The object was a single bright light, much larger and brighter than normal aircraft lights. Its exact size, shape, and altitude could not be determined.
(3) Manner of observation: The object was observed visually by the crew of the Stratocruiser aircraft.
(4) Time and duration of observation: The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
(5) Weather conditions: Clear, no cloud cover.
