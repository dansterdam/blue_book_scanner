24 June 1953                                                New London, Connecticut

Description

On 24 June 1953 one unidentified flying object was sighted by two Eastern Airlines' flights and one American Airlines' flight approximately 10-20 miles south-southeast of New London, Connecticut. This object appeared to burst into flames as it broke into two pieces, soon afterwards extinguishing itself and dropping into the ocean.

Discussion

This incident was solved very easily. Supplementary information received by Project Blue Book on 26 June 1953 stated "Objects sighted by pilots at approximately 26 June 1953. Two jet aircraft out of Quonset Point NAS had a mid-air collision at 2130E 24 June 1953. Aircraft fell in flames 15 miles west of Quonset Point." After interrogation of pilots, it was concluded that the flights did observe the above collision.

Conclusion

Was aircraft.

Dear Sir:

Reference your letter dated 29 June 1953 reporting an unidentified aerial object sighting by Captain D. W. Kelley on 24 June 1953 at 2130 Eastern Standard Time.

The following data will fully explain this sighting:

Two job aircraft out of Quonset Point NAS had a mid-air collision 15 miles west of their station. These two aircraft fell into the sea in flames. The time of the collision was approximately 2130 hours Eastern Standard Time, 24 June 1953.

Project Blue Book wishes to express its appreciation to your organization for reporting this incident. If at any other time in the future your organization encounters any unidentified aerial phenomena, do not hesitate to report it as soon as possible. In the past, we have had several valuable reports from American Airline pilots. Thank you again for your cooperation.

Attention: ATIA - 20

Dear Sir:

In accordance with a request submitted by Flight Service through the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, American Airlines Captain D. W. Kelly has submitted the following statement concerning an observation which he made while operating American Airlines flight 359 between Boston and La Guardia, on June 24, 1953:

"Flight 359 was just north of Moonsocket at 4,000 feet on a compass course of 247 degrees. At 2121 Eastern Standard Time a large flash of light was seen in the sky to the south. Bearing to the light was approximately 190 degrees. The flash appeared to have occurred at an estimated altitude of 14,000 feet. The light then broke into two separate lights, and the light farthest west broke into two separate lights, one much larger than the other. All lights fell seaward and were extinguished immediately upon reaching the surface. I estimate it took between one and one and one-half minutes for the objects to fall.

"I can only guess, but it is my observation the objects fell into the Sound in an area bounded by westerly, Rhode Island; Block Island and Montauk Point."

If we may be of further assistance concerning this incident, please advise.

Yours very truly,
AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.
