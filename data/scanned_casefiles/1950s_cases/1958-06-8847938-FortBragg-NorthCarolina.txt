PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 20 Jun 58
2. LOCATION: Fort Bragg, North Carolina
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
4. SOURCE: Military
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 mins

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
At approximately 2100 hrs, 2 Military officers, both pilots, observed a strange unidentified object in the sky over Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The object was described as being bright red-orange in color, moving in a straight line, and increasing in speed over a period of 10 minutes. At first, the object appeared to be about the size of a dime at arm's length, but it then decreased in size as it accelerated and moved out of sight. The object displayed a pulsating or flickering motion and increased in brightness as it moved away.

CONCLUSIONS:
The observers reported seeing a very strange and puzzling object. While the object was not identified, it does not appear to have been an aircraft or any other known type of aerial vehicle. The object's size, color, pulsating motion, and acceleration suggest it was some type of unconventional aerial phenomena. No further information is available to conclusively determine the nature of this sighting.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
LOCATION: Fort Bragg, North Carolina
DATE: 23 June 1958
SYNOPSIS: An Unidentified Flying Object was observed by Capt. M.S. Pope, USA, Group Center Wing (M), Pope AFB NO. An detailed description of the object is provided.
DETAILS: On 23 June 1958 at approximately 0052 Z, M/Sgt. LOU G. GLYNN, Capt. US Intelligence Officer, was performing routine duties in the control tower at Pope AFB, NO. Suddenly he observed an unidentified flying object at approximately 0045 Z over the countryside near Fort Bragg, North Carolina. After a careful visual and radar observation, it was determined that the object was oval-shaped, about 50 feet in diameter, and travel led at an estimated speed of 360 knots. The object then moved at great speed on a course of 360 degrees until it faded from sight. Weather at the time of the sighting was clear with good visibility.
It appears at this time that a phenomenon occurred.
