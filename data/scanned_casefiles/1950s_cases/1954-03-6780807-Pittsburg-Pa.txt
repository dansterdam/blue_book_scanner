On 11 March 1954, while attempting to pick up targets during exercise battle station war look on an object at first believed to be a stationary ground target. During the complete period of observation the object which changed position in altitude, azimuth, range or elevation. The size and shape of the object was undetermined.

The object was first sighted approximately 4220 hrs 11 March 1954, and observed until Site # 70 was relieved approximately 1500 hrs 12 March 1954.

The object appeared on the "A" scope of the track radar at sharp returns. This was still not observed on the PPI scope due to the scintillating radar being out of action. Spotters were put out but no visual contact at the target was available.

The object was sighted from Site # 70. Azimuth of the object 2563 mils, elevation 770 mils, range 9595 yds, altitude approximately 19,000 ft, and located at KL 5624.

The object was observed by Major Marcus, Executive Officer of the Battalion, Col Edward Yalomo, Range Platoon Sgt of Btry B 509th AAA Bn (Gun) (90mm) and the other members of the radar crew then on duty.

During the time of observation the weather was fairly clear and winds were approximately 40 miles per hour in velocity coming in from an azimuth of 4900 mils.

During the time of observation there were no meteorological or other conditions which might account for the radar target.

For drawing of pip return and scale drawing of minimum, maximum elevation and range returns see exhibit one and two attached.

Aircraft were dispatched from Greater Pittsburgh Airport, but information in regards to their findings were not made available to this unit.

1. The following information is in regards to an unidentified object picked up on 11 March 1954:

a. The object appeared on the track "A" scope as a pip. The object was stationary, having no appreciable speed and emitted no sound.

b. The time of sighting was 1204.5 hours. We observed a target intermittently for a mechanical trouble, until military grid site 80 at 1209.05 hours.

c. Number of observation was electronic. An AN/APS-413 was used to find target.

d. The location of observation was site 60, grid coordinates KL5221%. The target was at an azimuth of 601M, elevation 87% and range of 17.4 yards. Altitude was approximately 1500 feet.

e. No one visually observed the target, except as presented on the tracking indicators.

f. The weather was clear, with an overcast sky. The wind was 40 degrees at an azimuth of 090 mils.

1. No knowledge of activities which might account for the sighting.
2. No physical evidence of the sighting.
3. No intention or ability to identify target possible.
4. No aircraft in the vicinity at the time of our spotting.

2. The automatic frequency control would not operate continuously due to a cathode-resistor (K-26) of the local oscillator changing value. Therefore we could not lock on frequency and could not stay locked on target.

Our track was intermittent. During the time we were attempting to lock on the stationary object, because the trouble was so intermittent, it hampered the mechanic in isolating the difficulty. There would be track width for a time, and then it would fade out.

Transmitted herewith are reports submitted by units of this command relative to the UFOB reported to your headquarters by TWX on 17 March.

As of this date the radars of this command can still remain in the vicinity being seen from the area originally reported at an altitude of 120.70 PD 000 feet. This who definitely has or effect on the cluster diagram of the radar sets of this command and, whatever it is, it could conceivably be employed as a deception device or counter measure.

No further information concerning the source of this object has been in-house by the responsible investigative agency, although Headquarters, NO ADJY, released this command from the mission of tracking this electronic phenomenon until 12150K March.

It is recommended that appropriate Air Force agencies be requested not to drop the investigation of this phenomenon until a satisfactory explanation is determined. The fact that ten of the twelve M33 radars of this command reported essentially the same phenomenon makes this a matter of serious concern. In fact, the UFOB was located in the cluster of the eleventh M33 and the twelfth M33 was inoperative.

Broughton, Pennsylvania

In compliance with paragraph number 5 Circular number 6 Headquarters EIAICO dated 23 February 1954, the following is submitted:

The object picked up on the Track Radar was a completely unidentifiable object invisible to any means of identification.

The object was picked up at 2300 hours Roger time 11 March 1954 and tracked until 0600 hours Roger time 12 March 1954. Through permission of 18th AAA Group. The phenomena, however, did not persist from our success and were periodically tracked throughout the day.

The manner of observation was electronic tracking of the target. At apparent as a stationary target at an altitude of about 10,000'. The elevation was 1370°; Azimuth, 3350; and Range.

The observers were located in the M33 Van and visual observers were plotted but because of the type of day and the nature of phenomena, no visible signs could be determined.

It was definitely established that the phenomena did occur and were (all reliable) that were in the Radar unit and that we were tracking the object.

Net message of 11 March 1954, 1900 hours Roger consisted of the following data:

Wind Azimuth 5700
Wind Speed 15
Density 99.8
Alt Temp. 4.0

Net message of 12 March 1954, 0540 Roger consisted of the following:

Wind Azimuth 5200
Wind Speed 9
Density 100.7
Alt Temp. 4.0

Here is the text I can read from the document:

(cont'd.)

6. It is thought in this Battery that the phenomena in question were caused by:
electricity or static: electricity of a prominent storm point. Since the first spot in the sky.

8. There was no evidence of any physical action that can cause.

1. Cooperation with the Airforce: secured through Hqtrs. Headquarters.

BATTERY D 701ST AAA BATTALION
SOUTH PARK MILITARY RESERVATION
Abington, Pennsylvania

STATEMENT
                                                                        18 March 1954

As Duty Officer, I was called to the M33 van at approximately 0001 hours on 12 March 1954 to observe and supervise the operation of my Battery Radar crew. At this time they were on stand by surveillance and were busy trying 1 lock on a target assigned to them by Ingress. At approximately 0100 hours they succeeded in locking on the target through the clutter which is extremely heavy with it. The unmoveability and continuous stability of the target indicated that it was a bounce echo. In appearance the pip was similar to any normal target pip.

The Radar crew remained locked on the target until Elevated Altitude QRA 015 hours, without apparent movement of the target. Subsequently searches on later dates have produced the same phenomenon with very minor azimuth and elevation variations.

Master Sergeant Chess was called in from home after careful scrutiny he was of the same opinion as the undersigned as to the nature and substance of the target.

                                                                        WILLIAM R WALTERS

STATEMENT

On March 11, 1954 Site 11 went on stand by surveillance. At or about 0400 hours Express called down and gave us a plot chart (in Site 26). It took us about two hours to locate the target. When we got on the target it looked like an ordinary target. We went into automatic and stayed in automatic until we were relieved and the thing did not move.
