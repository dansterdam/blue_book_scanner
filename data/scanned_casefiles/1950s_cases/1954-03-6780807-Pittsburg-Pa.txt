1. At approximately 2300 hours, 15 January 1954, the following incident occurred:
a. It was observed by the personnel of the emplacement that a bright light, which appeared to be an aircraft, was sighted in the southern sky traveling in a northerly direction.
b. After the object had been observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, it appeared to stop and hover at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet.
c. While the object was in a hovering position, a second similar object was observed approaching the first object from the northeast. The second object also appeared to stop and hover adjacent to the first object.
d. After the two objects had remained in a hovering position for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, they suddenly accelerated and streaked off to the northwest at tremendous speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.
e. The visual sighting was corroborated by radar contact at the same time and location. The radar plot indicated that the objects were traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour.

On 11 March 1954, while attempting to pick up targets during exercise battle stations, the lights of an object is first believed to be a stationary aircraft. This object however, changed position. velocity, range or elevation. The size and shape of this object remained constant.

The object was observed visually by Major Marvin. Executive Officer of the Battalion, and Platoon Sgt. of Btry B 509th AAA Bn (Gun) (90mm).

During the time of observation the weather was fairly clear and winds were approximately 10 miles per hour in velocity, coming in westerly direction.

During the time of observation there were no meteorological or other conditions which might have accounted for the object.

The job origiinatlng this report stated that on 18 March 1954 at approximately 10:45 p.m. EST, he observed an unusual object in the sky which he was unable to identify.

The job originating this report stated that the object was first observed in the southwest sky and appeared to be moving in a northeasterly direction. The object was described as approximately twice the size of a star and very bright, emitting a brilliant white light. The object was reported to have been visible for a period of approximately 7-8 minutes.

6. The job training for this officer was released from active duty on 15 March 1954 and was not on duty at the time of the incident, but did observe the object and report it to the proper authorities.

7. No plans are now evident which might account for his ability to enter this observe the object.

8. There are no physical evidences available which might substantiate the existence of the object.

10. It is the considered but uncertain opinion of the observers that the object was possibly a meteor or other heavenly body, possibly closer than normal, and caught the light in such a manner as to appear unusually large and bright.

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

It is the contention of the writer that some physical factors were involved in the sighting, that there was more to the incident than just a visual impression. The physical factors noted at the sighting were:

1. The object moved in a manner which could not be attributed to any known type of conventional aircraft. It was capable of instantaneous stops and starts, sharp changes in direction, and accelerations which far exceeded the capabilities of any jet aircraft.

2. The object gave off a light which was illumined from within. This light was a brilliant white color and was not the reflection of sunlight.

3. The object was in view for a period of over 15 minutes, during which time it maintained a constant altitude and was under complete control and direction.

In the opinion of the writer, the behavior of the object was such that it could not be attributed to any known type of aircraft, either conventional or experimental. The maneuvers and performances exceeded the known capabilities of any man-made device.

STATEMENT

AS Duty Officer, I was called to the M33 Radar at approximately 0001 hours on 12 March 1952, to observe the operation of my Battery Radar Crew. At this time they were on stand-by surveillance of the local airspace. 

At approximately 2100 hours they succeeded in picking up on the radar screen an unidentified object which is estimated to have been about 20 miles distant from the Battery. The object was moving at a fairly high speed and had very minor erratic and elevation variations.

The object was of the opinion that it was a homing pigeon in appearance, the pip size indicating that it was a normal echo. This opinion is based on the fact that the radar crew had previous experience with homing pigeons, and the pip size and maneuvers of the unidentified object were similar to those of homing pigeons which they had tracked on previous occasions.

STATEMENT 

On March 11, 1954, Site H was on stand by surveillance, or airborne GIGI radar coverage, from 1900 to 2300 hours. ( NO 5,26 ) . It took us about 3/4 hour to locate the target which was not visible on the screen until it came within about 15 miles of our site. We kept it in automatic track and stayed in contact with it until it went off the screen. We were not able to identify the aircraft or object and could not determine its speed or altitude.
