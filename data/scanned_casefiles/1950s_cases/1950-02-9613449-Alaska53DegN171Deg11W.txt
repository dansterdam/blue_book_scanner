AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: Sighting of Unidentified Object
Location: Alaska
Date of Report: 9 March 1950
Date of Information: 10 February 1950
Prepared by: Lt. J. E. Moythe
Forwarded by: Director of Intelligence, Alaskan Air Command

SUMMARY:
At approximately 22/2355, February, while flying at 9000 feet altitude, on Tram airway No. 8, approximately 120 miles northeast of Keta Island (approximate position 53° 30' N, 171° 11' W), First Lieutenant J. Motz, USAF, co-pilot 1st Lt. 554, Bud. No. 1538), sighted a real and white "flare" in the general area, approximately 20 to 3000 feet above and slightly to the right of the aircraft, at an estimated distance of 5 miles. This object was described as elliptical in shape, with a major diameter of 5 miles. It was only slightly greater than the background. As it hovered, it increased to be 30' in diameter when it burst. As it fell, it diminished in apparent size, and the red core gradually turned to white. After a lapsed time of approximately two minutes, the "flare" disappeared into the under-sky. The pilot on other means of support was puzzled, and the plane fell momentarily.

On sighting the "flare", Motz called the attention of the pilot, First Lieutenant J. J. Carroll, that J. J. also sighted the object as it fell, and lost altitude. First Lt. Carroll was sure that this was not a meteor or meteor-like. First Lt. Motz answered a series of flares (one red and the green). First Lt. Motz, as above, stated that this was not a meteor or meteor-like, because he has flown many meteors on numerous occasions, and had always experienced a different reaction from the such air in its vicinity at these objects.

Reported as cloudless above 3700 feet. No wind noticeable.

On this object, possibly a meteor or meteorite.

SYNOPSIS
Article in Wyandotte Echo, Kansas City, Kansas, 6 January 1950, stated
Kansas City auto dealer, [redacted] who claimed to have seen two "flying Saucers" which had
crashed at a radar station near the New Mexico and Arizona border.
These craft, each carrying a crew of two, were continued of some un-
known metal and were stocked with food in tablet form. [Redacted] also
claimed to have removed from one of the craft a radio receiving and
transmitting set, which, at 11:15 hours daily, received a message in an
unknown language.

[Redacted] said that about fifty (50) of these craft
had been found in the United States in a two year period. Forty (40)
of them being presently at the United States Research Bureau in Los
Angeles. Stated it was assumed the craft had come from the
planet Venus.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was initiated at the direction of the District Commander, based on information contained in the Wyandotte Echo, dated 6 January 1950.

2. On 14 January 1950, [redacted], Kansas City, Missouri, was interviewed regarding the story appearing in the Wyandotte Echo, 6 January 1950, a weekly newspaper published in Kansas City, Kansas, at 715 Minnesota Avenue, concerning flying saucers and which quoted [redacted]. (See Enclosure #1)

Concerning this article, [redacted] said the information contained in the article was correct in its entirety and was as he received it from [redacted], otherwise unidentified, at Denver, Colorado, about two weeks prior to the article appearing in the Echo. [redacted] went on to say that he gave the information to a man named [redacted], otherwise unidentified and unknown to [redacted] over the telephone. According to [redacted], he had no idea that the information be published. According to [redacted], an engineer at the Ford Plant, Denver, Colorado, knows [redacted] and his address, as does the representative of the J. Walter Thompson Advertising Company in Denver.

At the time [redacted] talked to [redacted] in Denver, he had shown him a piece of metal and tiny receiving and transmitting set which he stated he had secured from one of the two "flying saucers" which he crashed near the Arizona-New Mexico border. The metal, he stated, was light weight and similar to aluminum. [redacted] informed [redacted] that he had taken the radio set to a radio station with which he is connected in Denver, and that tests there revealed that at 1115 hours each day a broadcast was picked up on the radio. The broadcast was in some strange language, and according to [redacted] a "Chinaman talking Japanese." Further stated that he was going to take the metal to the Ford Plant for analysis and that he did not hear what the results of this analysis were.

THE WYANDOTTE ECHO
Kansas City, Kansas
January 8, 1950

"FLYING SAUCERS" FROM VENUS, CA[...] TO EARTH BY ACCIDENT, SAYS
FORD DEALER.

The secret of the "Flying Saucers" is a secret no longer. Two
weeks ago, [redacted], well-known Kansas City auto dealer, stopped over
in Denver returning from Ogden, Utah. While there he called on the
manager and the assistant manager of the Ford agency there. Their
conversation was interrupted by a call from two engineers, arranging
an immediate meeting. One of these engineers, a man named [redacted],
revealed some startling information.

Sees Saucers

According to the story told by [redacted], he "crashed the gate" at
a radar station near the New Mexico and Arizona border after two weeks
of arranging. Here he saw two of the highly secret "flying saucers."
One of these was badly damaged, while the other was almost perfectly
intact. These objects were space ships of an unusual design. They
consisted of two parts, a cockpit or cabin about six feet in diameter,
and a ring 18 feet across and about two feet thick surrounded this
cabin. In flight, the ring revolved at a high rate of speed, while
the cabin remained stationary like the center of a gyroscope. The ship
has a bearing type tripod landing gears. The cabin was constructed of a
metal resembling aluminum, but the actual make-up of the metal has defied
analysis. [redacted] had a portion of this metal in his possession, and
gave it to one of the Ford men with instructions to send it to the Dear-
born Ford plant laboratory to see if they could either melt it or analyze
it.

Crews Dead

Each of the two ships seen by [redacted] were occupied by a crew of
two. In the badly damaged ship, these bodies were carried so badly that
11 were could be learned from them. The occupants of the other ship,
when [redacted] saw them, were in a perfect state of preservation. Medical
reports, according to [redacted], showed that these men were almost identical
with earth-dwelling humans, except for a few minor differences. They
were of a uniform height of three feet, were uniformly blond, beardless
and their teeth were completely free of fillings or cavities.

Strange Cloth and Hood

They were dressed in uniform clothing made from blue material un-
known on earth, the threads in the clothing seeming to be a sort of wire.
The jackets had six buttons, and the trousers were tight-fitting. Their
shoes were of a slip-on type. They did not wear undergarments, but had
their bodies taped. [redacted] said that it was a matter of speculation

whether this was the customary garb of these people, or whether these
were "space suits" or flying suits.

In each ship was a quantity of food in tablet form. One type of
the food was in the form of small white tablets, about half the size
of Alka-Seltzer tablets. Another type was a small brown cube, which,
when immersed in water, swelled to a volume of about a gallon. Water
contained in the ships had a weight twice as great as water on earth.

The ships seemed to be magnetically controlled and powered, as
they had no power plant in the ship itself. No armament or exploratory
equipment was found in them, since they seem to invariably crash
near radar installations; it is surmised that they are attracted by
radar, or possibly radar waves interfere with their control systems.

Lunar Clock

In addition to the piece of metal, showed the group in-
cluded a clock or automatic calendar taken from one of the crafts.
It consisted of two pieces of metal sandwiching some unusual type of
material. On the face of one of these pieces of metal appeared an
indication, which, rotating around the disc, completed a cycle each
28 days, a lunar month.

Fifty Are Found

According to the information given, there are around fifty
of these craft that have been found in the United States in a period of
about two years, and forty of these are in the United States Research
Bureau in Los Angeles.

said that the best assumption as to the source of the ships
was the planet Venus, for it is the only planet that has an atmosphere
in any way similar to ours, and it seems to have magnetic properties
that would make it the logical home base of these space ships.

Planned "Leak"

Dr. assumption as to the reason behind the apparent lack of
security is that the government desires the information to be spread
from unofficial sources, until people are more or less familiar with the
facts. He feels that the security departments of the military fear that
the sudden shock of a surprise announcement of the fact that inter-
planetary travel was possible might cause mass hysteria. No cause for
alarm seems necessary, however, for, from all indications, the Venusian
visitors are quite peaceful, and even unwilling, visitors to our planet.

AT DENVER, COLORADO

1. This is a joint investigation of Special Agent FREDERICK F. HANSEN and the writer.

2. Mr. [redacted], Region Manager, Ford Motor Company, and [redacted] were interviewed 17 January 1950. The following information was revealed. [redacted], Field Representative, J. Walter Thompson Company, has been bringing stories concerning flying saucers to Station KGYR in Denver, Colorado, since early October 1949. These stories originated with [redacted], (previously reported as [redacted]), an advertising salesman for Station KGYR in Denver, Colorado. [redacted] stories describe the construction of flying saucers and the occupants. Just prior to Christmas, [redacted] had come parts from a flying saucer, in his possession, and requested that he attempt to arrange an interview with [redacted] and [redacted] came to the Ford Motor Company office where several Ford Motor Company employees were present. He brought with him two (2) gears; several metal discs, similar to "knock out" plugs from electrical fixtures; and a gadget described as a radio. He claimed to have had the radio playing at one time and it played a type of music similar to Chinese. During the time of the visit at the Ford Motor Company the radio remained silent. While examining the gears with a magnifying glass, he discovered the Arabic numeral "6" and a small arrow. [redacted] called in one of his shop engineers who examined the gears and pronounced them "just gears". [redacted] described the small metal discs as a soft aluminum like metal which scratched easily. [redacted] claimed that a friend of his at the Wint-er-Weiss Company (auto-mobile equipment) was unable to analyze the type of metal. Immediately contacted [redacted] and Wint-er-Weiss Company and had him check the truth of the statement. Mr. [redacted] called back in twenty-five (25) minutes and stated positively that none of his employees had conducted an analysis of metal for [redacted]. At this time Mr. [redacted] offered to have the metals analyzed by the Ford Motor Company technicians in Dearborn, Michigan, but [redacted] declined the offer.

Technicians in Dearborn, Michigan, who were called to a installation near Phoenix, Arizona and had actually seen two (2) flying saucers. They were mounted on a tripod type landing gear. The entire craft could be lifted by two persons. One craft was damaged and the occupants had been turned. The other craft was intact and the occupants were a perfect state of preservation. They were three (3) feet tall, blond hair, beard-less, and had perfect teeth. These occupants were garbed in a blue uniform of cloth made from wire fabric. [redacted] mentioned that the one had a supply of food in tablet form and water weighing twice that of the water on earth. [redacted] a scientist in Phoenix, Arizona, (spelling unknown) who also told of fifteen (15) flying saucer occupants presently to earth near Phoenix and that they became invisible when pursued. It is the

firm opinion of Mr. [illegible] and Mr. [illegible] that [illegible] does not have a "full string of fish", and that he is "probably off his rocker".

Since the meeting with the [illegible] Washington newscaster and the editor of the Amarillo Globe (Texas), regarding the flying saucers, but told them that he would rather not be connected with any such fantastic tale, and stated that they would excuse a signed statement if deemed necessary.

3. Mr. [illegible], radio advertising salesman, Station KXYZ, Denver, Colorado, was interviewed 19 January 1950, in the meeting at the Ford Motor Company with [illegible] and several others. He admitted divulging to these persons information concerning flying saucers, but denied very profoundly having had any metals or gadgets. He also denied mentioning any names regarding his source of information. He stated that he had no parts of flying saucers. In his possession at present. He denied having ever seen any flying saucers or their occupants. He stated that the source of his information was confidential in nature and that he was duty-bound not to reveal such source. He stated that if he had been contacted by CIA Agent a month ago, he would have given any information he might have had. He claimed to have been contacted by his source and told to forget everything he knew, concerning the flying saucers.

Claimed to have been approached by at least three magazines and offered as high as $5,000.00 for his flying saucer story. He was also approached by a representative of the Kansas City Star. He declined to reveal any information. He stated that he fully believes that flying saucers do exist and that elementary travel is being accomplished.

4. Mr. [illegible], Field Representative, Company, Denver, Colorado branch, was interviewed 23 January 1950. Mr. [illegible] stated that [illegible] had been telling him stories concerning the flying saucers since early in October 1949. He described one as being 116 feet across and carrying 16 occupants. He stated that they had come from Venus and had made the trip in forty-one (41) minutes.

He stated the speed of these saucers was around 100,000 miles per second. He stated that his source of information was a Dr. [illegible] of Phoenix, Arizona and four other scientists. He told [illegible] that he had met these scientists through his wife, who was either related to one of them, or a friend of some of them. They had accepted a dinner invitation from a [illegible] when on route to Phoenix, Arizona from the Wyoming Oil Fields where they had conducted experiments.

Kept in contact with these scientists and gathered quite a bit of information concerning flying saucers. He told [illegible] that the flying saucers were landing near Albuquerque, New Mexico, due to the attraction of the radar installation nearby. He presumed that the radar activity had an effect on these saucers since they were powered by a magnetic drawn from the atmosphere. After landing near Albuquerque these saucers, according to [illegible] have been transported to an installation near Phoenix.
