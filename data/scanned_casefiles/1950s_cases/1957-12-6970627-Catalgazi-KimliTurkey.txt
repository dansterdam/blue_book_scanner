The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing a sighting that occurred on 13 Dec 57 and 14 Dec 57 near the towns of Catagazzi and Kilimi in Turkey. The document describes an object believed to be a guided missile that was seen moving in a westerly direction, as well as a large, bright object that was seen falling from the sky in the direction of those towns. The latter object was described as a second unidentified object moving at great speed and leaving a blue trace behind it, appearing to be about three inches above the horizon.

On 13 Dec 57 an object believed to be a guided missile was seen moving in a westerly direction headed toward the Crimea.

On 14 Dec 57 a large, bright object was seen falling from the sky in the direction of the towns of Catagazzi and Kilimi. Approximately fifteen seconds later a second unidentified object was seen moving in a westerly direction at great speed, leaving a blue trace behind it. The latter object appeared to be moving about three inches above the horizon.
