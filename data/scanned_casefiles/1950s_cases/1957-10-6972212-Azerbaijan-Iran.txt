SUMMARY (Brief concise summary of information, facts, conclusions, etc., as presented in the following paragraphs. If the information is judged to be significant, indicate why.):
American Consular Officials, Tabriz, to the American Embassy, Tehran on 16 Nov 57:
On 16 November 1957, several unidentified flying objects were sighted over Azerbaijan. The first report was at 1735 hours on 16 November, when 21 objects like "firecrackers" were observed in the southern sky. They moved at a high rate of speed and changed direction sharply on several occasions. The objects were observed by the (13th) Air Force Control Radar Station and by several other observers on the ground. The objects were observed again at 1810 hours and at 1925 hours. The objects observed at 1925 hours moved rapidly across the sky, paused, and then moved on again. The objects were estimated to be 1-2 thousand feet in altitude and were observed for approximately 15-20 minutes. There was no noise and they left no trail. The weather was clear and there was a full moon.
