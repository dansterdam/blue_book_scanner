10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) round, reddish-white object, the size of a dime at arm's length, was observed by a fifteen year old.

11. COMMENTS
The characteristics of this object seem to coincide with those of a balloon. Observer stated the object appeared, and disappeared at the same point, but yet the object went "straight up", and at the same time disappeared over the horizon. This doesn't add up but the rest of the facts seem to bear out a balloon sighting. No investigation authorized by this headquarters.
