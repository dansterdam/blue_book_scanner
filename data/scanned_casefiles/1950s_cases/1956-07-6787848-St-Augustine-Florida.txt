The text on this page is largely illegible. There are some partially visible lines of text at the top of the page, but most of the content is too faint or blurry to read clearly. 

In the top right corner, there is a handwritten notation that appears to read "3-4X2" with some additional markings.

The rest of the page is mostly blank or contains very faint, unreadable text.


- page 2 -

Most of the text on this page is redacted with black marks covering the majority of the text. The only legible text I can see is at the bottom of the page, which reads:

BE OF SUFFICIENT USE TO INDICATE

The rest of the document appears to be obscured by black redaction marks.
