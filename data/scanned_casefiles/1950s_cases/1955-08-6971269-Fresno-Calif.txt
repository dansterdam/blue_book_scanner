SUBJECT
    Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object

1. The following report was submitted through channels to the Chief, U.S. Weather Bureau, by Weather Bureau Airport Station at Fresno, California.

2. On 2 August 1955, [redacted] was taking the 2100Z aerial observation when a bright circular object was noted crossing the telescopic field of view. It was silver in color, such as a metallic surface would appear when reflecting sunlight. It was bright, and the white balloon, no shadow or markings were distinguishable on the object, but it was sharply outlined against the blue sky background. At the time, about 1:30 P.M. PST, the balloon was in its twenty-ninth minute and approaching 270,000 feet above the surface. The object had an apparent diameter of about one-fourth or one-fifth of that of the five-foot balloon at that height. The realized that such an object and height of such an object are interdependent and very difficult, if not impossible to judge, his impression at the time of the observation was that the object was far above the balloon and therefore could have been larger than the balloon. The object moved at a steady rate of speed and was tracked with the telescopic far above a half minute to as long as 10 min. This resulted in losing the balloon from the field of view, so he had to return to the balloon to continue the record. The movement of the object across the line of sight was so very fast, although much faster than the slowly moving balloon, and in a different direction. Later calculations (assuming horizontal flight) of the estimated movement indicated that the object moved at a speed of 30-130 knots if at 16,000 feet MSL, or 120-200 knots if at 65,000 feet.
