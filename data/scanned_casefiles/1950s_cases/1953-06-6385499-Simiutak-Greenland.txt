COMMENTS: Although the integrity of the observer is considered excellent, it is believed the exaggerated statements of the object. Consider of local weather station states opinion that only possibly, or pheno could be an optical illusion or familiar in the lens of the theodolite. This type balloon not expected to burst below 20,000 ft.

SUMMARY:

1. At 1445, 24 June 1953, A/2c Richard A. Hill AF 11 173 575, a weather observer with three and one-half years experience, while tracking a weather balloon through a theodolite, sighted an unidentified aerial object approximately three miles distant from the observation point at Simiutak, Greenland (6118, 4634W). The object was sighted instantly upon explosion of the 100 gram balloon, causing A/2c Hill to state the object had burst the balloon. Description of the object at this time was expressed by the observer as being triangular, red and rotating while in a hovering position. The size was estimated to be two times that of the 100 gram balloon. The object continued to hover at the altitude of approximately 18,000 feet (according to theodolite readings conducted by A/2c Hill at the time) for fifteen seconds. The observer continued to watch the object for five minutes while it climbed. Upon moving it appeared to be a red ball-shaped dot. It left no trail and seemed to be gaining altitude at a tremendous rate of speed, finally disappearing after five minutes. Object was seen by subject individually only.

2. The observer stated that the object disappeared in a northwesterly direction and seemed to be climbing rapidly. Theodolite reading of 301 degrees were taken for five minutes as the object disappeared from view. 8/13th Weather Detachment, this station, advised that the 24/1500Z phell at Simiutak showed winds at 10,000 feet 120 degrees at 14 knots, 12,000 feet 120 degrees at 13 knots, 14,000 feet 180 degrees at 4 knots, 16,000 feet 200 degrees at 7 knots. The phell between 16,000 and 18,000 feet a marked wind shift occurred. An analysis of the 15002 500 millibar chart stated winds at 18,000 feet at Simiutak were 280 degrees at 12 knots. Winds from 18,000 to 20,000 feet were northwesterly at 15 knots. The unidentified object, therefore, disappeared into the wind. Cloud conditions were 3/10 cirrus clouds at 20,000 feet at time of sighting, with 1/10 altoocumulus at 8,000 feet.

STATEMENT

I, A/2c Richard A. Hill AF 11173575, after having been duly sworn do hereby make the following statement. The statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

At 241430Z June 1953 as I was following the pilot balloon through the theodolite the balloon burst and it its place was a red object. It seemed to be twice as large as a 100 gram balloon which is about 4 feet in diameter. The balloon was at an altitude of 18,000 feet, then it burst and approximately three miles from the observation point. It held approximately the same position for 15 seconds by making slow circular movements much as a loop. The object was not discernable as to its structure but it did appear to have a definite shape which seemed somewhat triangular. Then it started moving towards the northwest picking up speed rapidly. Upon moving its apparent red ball-shaped dot. It left no trails and seemed to be gaining altitude and a tremendous rate of speed and finally disappearing after five minutes.

JOINT MESSAGEFORM

FROM: (Originator)
COMD ATIC

TO: OTHER CLEVELAND AIR BASE TRANSCEIVER
CLEVELAND, OHIO

INFO:

Regards ITT 3793. ATIC has received teletype ITT 3793 and two succeeding wires on sighting of unidentified object on 24 Jun 53 at 11:30. In written report request you inclose answers to the following questions: 1) Was the supposed collision of the object and the piball seen through theodolite or by naked eye? Your message 3140 states that observer did not see the object and the balloon simultaneously through theodolite. 2) Could a 120 gram piball be observed at 16,000' under existing atmospheric conditions? What were atmospheric conditions? 3) At what altitude was the piball set to burst? Suggest you contact weather personnel to determine if any phenomenon known to them could have caused the sighting. Was the piball carrying instruments and, therefore, a red parachute? ATIC cannot at this time find an answer for the sighting. Await your written Air Force Form 112. In reply cite ITT 3084 Pine Docks, ATCHINSON; ATCHISON.

1. An unidentified aerial object was sighted through a theodolite by a
weather observer approximately three (3) miles from Simiutak (61.11N/163.4W)
Greenland 24 June 1953 at 14:52.

2. A/3C Richard A. Hill, AF 11735575, a weather observer with three and
one-half years experience was tracking a pilot balloon at 11,000 feet. The
object was sighted instantly upon explosion of the JFO was balloon, causing
A/3C Hill to state that the object was very low.

3. The object was described to be red, somewhat triangular in shape, and
rotating while in a hovering position. Size of the object was estimated to be
twice that of the pilot balloon, which was approximately 15 feet in diameter
at 15,000 feet. The object continued to hover at 18,000 feet for 15 seconds
according to theodolite recordings continued to A/2C Hill at the time.

4. The observer continued to watch the object for five (5) minutes while it
climbed to the west. Upon moving, the object appeared to be a red yellow spot.
If left to trail and continued on the same path, it would have appeared as a
finally disappearing in a northwest-by direction after five minutes. Theodolite
readings of 301 degrees were taken for five (5) minutes as the object disappeared
from view.

5. The 6th Weather Detachment at "Thule" AB advised that the 24,500lb
pilot balloon at Simiutak sighted at 10,000 feet 120 degrees at 14 knots,
12,000 feet 120 degrees at 13 knots, 14,000 feet 120 degrees at 4 knots, 16,000
feet 200 degrees at 7 knots. The pilot was terminator at this height. Between
16,000 and 18,000 feet a surface wind check occurred at the 15 Loran, 500
500 millibar chart revealed that winds at 15,000 over Simiutak were 220 degrees
at 12 knots. Winds from 12,000 to 20,000 were northeasterly at 15 knots. Cloud
conditions were 3/10 cirrus clouds at 20,000 feet at time of sighting, with 1/10
alti-cumulus at 5,000 feet.

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer:

1. Significant factors to be considered in a preliminary evaluation are:
(1) The object was observed by one person only; (2) The sighting is unique in
that the object was observed through an instrument; (3) The object appeared
instantaneously after balloon burst.

2. The possibility that the object was in some way caused by the balloon
burst is strengthened by the fact that the object appeared immediately after
the burst. To believe that it is of any independent factor is
believing too much coincidence.

3. Although the winds at 12,000 feet were generally northwesterly, one
cannot conclude that the object's movement into a wind, etc., will continue
upon altitude measurements of the object, it is not possible to determine its
direction or travel.

4. Complete analysis of this incident is left to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Project Bluebook.

SUMMARY

Reference your message AFOIN-ATIAR-6-25-R, 302131Z concerning the Simiutak flying object (FLXOBRPT), Project Blue Book

a. Collision of object and piball was seen through the theodolite.

b. Neither the piball nor the object could be seen by the naked eye. Atmospheric conditions were scattered clouds at 8,000 feet and 20,000 feet with visibility at twenty-five miles.

c. A one hundred gram piball would not be expected to burst below 30,000 feet and possibly not until 40,000 feet of height, depending upon the pressure. There was no abnormally low pressure at the time. Piball was not carrying instruments. The Commander of 8/13th Weather Detachment believes that in his opinion the only possibility of a phenomena would be an optical illusion or parallax in the lens of the theodolite.
