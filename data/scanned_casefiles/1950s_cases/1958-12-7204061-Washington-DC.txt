the moon is more dark than in the area bathed in the "light spray", since

1. This report is in compliance to a request by Col. Glaser of AFCIN-484 dated
8 December 1958.

2. The subject photographs comprise three (3) group pertaining to (1) an uni-
dentified flying object; (2) the moon with thin, straight streaks of light touching
its image; and (3) photographs (of 35 mm film) showing several exposures of the moon.

3. The entire lot of the photographs were extensively analyzed in order to
arrive at a salient interpretation. The analysis and interpretation were se-
verely hampered by the fact that the original film was not obtained; therefore,
considering the nature of the subject, background information relative to the acqui-
sition of the photographs and from past experience with the donor's photography, there
is some doubt as to the authenticity of the photographs in general. This is to say
that the photographs could have been reproduced in such a manner as to exhibit con-
ditions or objects that never normally existed. This is entirely possible when
considering photographic or photographic reproduction techniques. The possible conditions
or objects. Only an examination of the original negatives would eliminate the atmos-
pheric or doubt pertaining to the authenticity of the exposures.

4. In group (1) the unidentified flying object appears to be a small change
purse open and having a plastic body. This is evidenced by the transparency around
its edges. It also gives the impression of having contents inside. (2) the streaks
of light on photograph #8 would be 50% miles long and 12.5 miles wide compared
with the image of the moon, assuming the streak is in the immediate area of the moon.
No angular aspects were calculable, nor was any parallel correction attempted. This
line and the other smaller ones which are not straight are actually double lines and
are much sharper in detail than the image of the moon. The lines could be (1) shall-
low scratches (2) lint or other debris or (3) a combination of both. The two rel-
atively small areas called "blurs" (one just inside, the other just outside the
edges of the moon image) appear to be the beginnings of static electricity dis-
charges.

5. Photograph #9 of the same group has an image of the moon taken at a differ-
ent date and apparently exhibits the same conditions as in photograph #8.

6. In group (3) the interest is centered around a copy photograph of a 35 mm
film strip presumably "stereo" type, in which one of the exposures of the moon has
a curious "spray" of diffused light on what are five circular objects, apparently
casting an elongated oval shadow. The cause of the "light spray" has not been
determined, although there are several possibilities that could lend themselves to
that end. The five objects in front of the moon appear to be transparent and hemi-
spherical. They cast a shadow which exhibits an umbra and a penumbra thereby sug-
gesting an artificial light source. The hemispherical could be water droplets on the

had greater significance due to Russian astronomer's claim that he had observed a volcanic eruption on the moon (Tab-B). claim is that this was just a misinterpretation of one of his pictured "blast-offs".

asked Major Friend his position and if he were free to make a definite commitment concerning the Air Force's attitude toward his development and was informed by Major Friend that the Air Science Division's interest in the matter was restricted to the images, if they were images, on the film. However, was persistent in the connection of his developer and the images, his belief is that present commercial developers would not bring out these images. The attitude of commercial was that he should be paid a cover the expenses he had incurred in making these photographs, he estimates approximately $1000.00. He expressed anger and disgust in that he had offered all of this material to the Air Force for free, along with his labor and the technique for capturing this phenomena on film, and had been rebuffed.

Major Friend requested prints of the film to bring back for analysis and/or interpretation. posed another question to Major Friend as to why he should turn the prints over to the Air Force when he had been given such an obvious run around. was informed that if he was a loyal citizen and felt, as he apparently did, that the images in the photographs constituted a threat to national security he was duty bound to release the photographs to the Air Force. He was informed that he would be in fact, bargaining with national security.

At this point informed Major Friend that the reasons the pictures had not been released by him for publication numbered four:

1. He couldn't support his family on the $10.00 a day paid to witnesses at Congressional hearings, and he was sure a hearing would result.

2. The Russians had been first in so many things he couldn't allow them to get a start here, using his pictures as a springboard.

3. He was afraid someone like would take the information and cause a panic.

4. He was afraid because of security reasons.

then excused himself from the room for the purpose of calling his attorney. Major Friend could not see or the telephone, but could hear the dialing; and the final half of the conversation. The officer couldn't determine if the connection had been made or possibly broken immediately after dialing. The final half of the conversation was very much in the same tone as previous exchange with Major Friend. Supposedly submitting to his lawyer's advice on the "bargaining" with national security point.

MEMO FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: UFO Pictures of [redacted]

I. The Investigation.

Major Friend of the Aerial Phenomena Group, Air Sciences Division, AFGIN-[redacted], visited Washington, D.C. 1 December 1958 through 4 December 1958, for the purpose of interviewing this gentleman, who has had some previous contact with [redacted] and [redacted] of ATIC concerning some photographs and a developer he has supposedly perfected, has plagued M/Gen. Watson's office with calls during the past few weeks.

Prior to contacting [redacted], Major Friend cleared with both Major Byrne of AFOIN-XL and Major Tacker of SAFIS-3. Neither had heard of [redacted] but were glad of ATIC's interest.

Initial contact with [redacted] was made by telephone on the morning of 3 December 1958. Informed Major Friend that it would be impossible to grant an appointment before approximately 1900, due to a large number of previous engagements with government people in high places and a pressing contract. [redacted] would not divulge the identity of these people or the agency with which they were associated, he later let drop broad hints like "top missile man". A specific comment of this initial contact was that outside of government service, if you don't produce, you don't eat. This one comment serves to sum up the man's attitude toward the government and more specifically the United States Air Force.

At approximately 1900 on 3 December 1958, Major Friend arrived at the Building, whose address is [redacted], where his place of business is located. [redacted] met Major Friend outside of his office area and asked to see his credentials, commenting that he didn't know the man. After inspecting the credentials, [redacted] warned that what was about to be seen was dynamite. Upon entering the place of business, Major Friend observed that the walls of the front room were littered with photographs.

Major Friend spent approximately three hours with [redacted], during which time gentleman confessed his ill feeling toward the Air Force, M/Gen. Watson, and these gentlemen - [redacted] and [redacted]. Feels that the Air Force and these gentlemen in particular are out to give one [redacted] a hard way. He had visited an earlier date concerning the photo developer he had supposedly perfected. It was determined by [redacted] that the developer was not as good as the present day commercial product (see Tab-A).

[redacted] was very enthusiastic about his photographs and felt that he had pictures of "blasts-offs" from the moon with an associated shock waves and of space ships in our own atmosphere with and without the moon as a background (see attached photographs). [redacted] felt that his photographs...

MOSCOW, NOV. 13--(UPI)--SOVIET ASTRONOMER NIKOLAI KOZYREV RECENTLY PHOTOGRAPHED A VOLCANO ERUPTING ON THE MOON, THE OFFICIAL SOVIET TASS NEWS AGENCY SAID LAST NIGHT.

KOZYREV TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPH AT ABOUT 4 A.M. MOSCOW TIME NOV. 3 WITH THE 50-INCH REFLECTOR OF THE CRIMEA ASTROPHYSICAL LABORATORY, TASS SAID.

KOZYREV DESCRIBED THE ERUPTION AS A REDDISH GLOW THAT GREW IN INTENSITY AFTER TWO HOURS.

"THERE WAS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF A VOLCANIC PROCESS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON," HE SAID.

CHAIRMAN OF THE ASTRONOMICAL COUNCIL OF THE SOVIET ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, SAID SPECTROGRAMS LEFT NO DOUBT THAT KOZYREV HAD SEEN A VOLCANO.

"WE CAN NOW REGARD AS ENTIRELY WRONG THE VIEW ON THE ORIGIN OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE LUNAR LANDSCAPE AS BEING DUE TO THE IMPACT OF METEORITES," HE SAID.

"THIS VOLCANIC ERUPTION SHOWS THAT THE PROCESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORMATION OF THE SURFACE RELIEF APPLY BOTH TO THE EARTH AND THE MOON."

                                                    74295/Bldg 828
                                                    COMMENT NO. 4

1. This report is in compliance to a request by Col. Glaser of AFCIN-454 dated
8 December 1958.

2. The subject photographs comprise three (3) groups pertaining to (1) an unidentified flying object, (2) the moon with thin, straight streaks of light touching its image, and (3) photographs (of 35 mm film) showing several exposures of the moon.

3. The entire lot of the photographs were extensively analyzed in order to arrive at a realistic interpretation. The analysis and interpretation phases were severely hampered by the fact that the original film was not obtained; therefore, considering the nature of the subject, background information relative to the acquisition of the photographs and from past experience with the donor's photography, there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the photographs in general. This is to say that the photographs could have been reproduced in such a manner as to exhibit conditions of doubt pertaining to the authenticity of the exposures.

4. In group (1) the unidentified flying object appears to be a small change purse open and having a plastic body. This is evidenced by the transparency around its edges. It also gives the impression of having contents inside, (2) the streak of light on photograph #8 would be 904 miles long and 125 miles wide when compared with the image of the moon, assuming the streak is in the immediate area of the moon. No angular aspects were calculable, nor was any parallax correction attempted. This line and the other smaller ones which are not straight are actually double lines and are much sharper in detail than the image of the moon. The lines could be (1) shallow scratches (2) lint or other debris or (3) a combination of both. The two relatively smaller and somewhat blurred images (one just inside, the other just outside the edges of the moon image) appear to be the beginnings of static electricity discharges.

5. Photograph #9 of the same group has an image of the moon taken at a different date and apparently exhibits the same conditions as in photograph #8.

6. In group (3) the interest is centered around a copy photograph of 35 mm film strip presumably "stereo" type, in which one of the exposures of the moon has a curious "spray" of diffused light on which are five circular or apparently casting an elongated oval shadow. The cause of the "light spray" has not been determined. Although there are several possibilities that could lead to an analysis to that end, the five objects in front of the moon appear to be transparent and hemispherical. They cast a shadow which exhibits an umbra and a penumbra thereby suggesting an artificial light source. The penumbras could be water droplets on the Classification Cancelled.

SECURITY CLASSIFICATION (U/FOUO)

FILE NO.                                                 SUBJECT: Conversation with Mr. _______ regarding Unidentified Objects on the Moon

TO: AFOIN-JE                                             DATE: 14 November 58 COMMENT NO: 1
                                                         70207/Bldg 828/Room 2102
FROM: AFOIN-LD

1. During my last visit to Washington, I was asked by Colonel McGarity to talk to General Watson's office regarding unidentified objects on the moon, now being making numerous phone calls.

2. To go to History, this same man is responsible for the development of some exclusive photo processing chemicals which have been used by the Ansco people. The Ansco people notified Major Randall about three months ago that this man had in his collection a photo which might be of interest to the intelligence community.

3. Mr. Fine told me that since that time he has taken many more photographs with different cameras and different telescopes. He thinks, as a matter of fact, he knows in his opinion that there are objects taking off from the moon. He says he sees "blast" off with another attack. He refers to the writings of a person named Neminger on the subject of ionic or sonic propulsion. I am not sure of the relationship of this.

4. He refers specifically to the articles which are appearing in the paper about the Soviets having seen eruptions on the moon. (An example of this type of article is attached.) No claim is that these are not eruptions but rather "things lasting off from the moon."

5. What is important in all this is that if the man has some real data it would concern either your UFO or Science Divisions. If he is not sincere, he might pass these pictures with his story to the press and cause us considerable embarrassment. I therefore suggest that this man be contacted and visited by people from your shop. My answer to him would be that I would notify the cognizant people who would carry it from there. His phone number in Washington is [ILLEGIBLE]

graphs are Tab D and are numbered to correspond to the numbers referenced
in the report from AFCIN-4D.

V. Conclusion.
It is the conclusion of the ATIC analyst that [redacted] was perpetrating a hoax, either for financial gain, for some pathological reason,
or possibly both. The unusual features of the pictures with his developer and his attempts to get money for the pictures dictates a lean toward the mercenary reason as a cause.

was going to let Major Friend have the prints because he felt that someone
was out to get this Officer by giving him a job as not as this one.
[redacted text] then made a call to his wife, more of the same simple banter.

[redacted text], on his return to the audience of Major Friend, related that
his phone and office were bugged and that he knew he was under investigation.
His sister worked at Alington Falls and according to him had not spoken to
him for two weeks because she had been so instructed. He further wanted to
know if M/Gen. Watson had sent Major Friend on the mission. Denials by the
Officer were firmly swept aside and he slowly convinced himself that
M/Gen. Watson was very definitely behind the whole thing as a result of his
calls to the General's office.

Finally [redacted text] turned over a set of his prints to Major Friend and
informed him that he was doing this only in the interest of national security.

All during the interview [redacted text] let drop intimations that his eyes
were such that he could see things which other people could see only through
the medium of photography, and that he had a theory by which he knew the
speeds of these bodies, there was continuous mention of "a wheel within a
wheel" and "Mach 2 /7".

On 4 December 1958, Major Friend briefed Major Byrne and Major Tucker
on the results of the meeting with [redacted text].

II. The Investigator's Impression of [redacted text]

[redacted text] appears to be approximately 42 years old and a man of more
than average intelligence. This man knows photography and the photographic
business, but tends to feel that everyone else connected with the industry
is less competent than he. While his physics and astronomy is limited, he
tends to make half statements using technical terms in an attempt to leave
one with the impression that he is competent in these areas. The following
is a layman's summation of the psychological attitude of [redacted text]:

1. Suffers from a persecution complex.

2. [redacted text] exhibits a superiority complex. It is hard
to tell if this is his real attitude or a defensive
mechanism for an inferiority complex.

The general appearance of the man was unkempt. He wore his clothes
in a sloppy manner and the same degree of untidiness was evident in his
business establishment. There was nothing connected with the man which
gave the impression of orderliness.

III. Actions.

On return to ATIC Major Friend turned the photographs over to AFOIN-LD
for analysis and/or interpretation.

IV. Analysis.

The report from AFOIN-LD appears as Tab-C to this document. The photo-
