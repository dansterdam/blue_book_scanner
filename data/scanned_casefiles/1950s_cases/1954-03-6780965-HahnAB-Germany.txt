THIS IS A CLEAR SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED WHITE LIGHTS SEEN FROM THE WILLIAMSPORT PA WEATHER BUREAU AT 22 KNOTS MILES AVAILABLE FROM WILLIAMSPORT PA WEATHER BUREAU AT 9,220 FT. FLIGHT THIS OCCURRED AT FOLEY PILOTS WHILE ALOFT BETWEEN 14,220 TO 16,280 FT. FROM THE LOWEST AT FORTY-FIVE KNOTS WINDS 16,940 FT. FROM THE LOWEST AT FIFTY KNOTS NO CEILING TO SPEAKING OF CLOUDS COVERAGE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER NONE TO THUNDER STORM. METEOROLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF THE SIGHTINGS SUCH AS PHOTOS ETC ARE 9-12 AS FAR AS KNOWN NO INTERCEPTION OR IDENTIFICATION ACTION TAKEN BY AIRCRAFT OTHER CAN CONTACTED TO INQUIRE IF THESE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS HAD BEEN DETECTED ON THEIR RADAR. THE TYPE AGENT SO ADVISED THIS. NO THAT THE FLIGHT SERVICE ADVISES THAT THERE WAS A JET AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA ABOUT 2445 HOURS EAST OF THE LOCATION TO WHICH THE WITNESS CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN THE OBJECTS. THEY WERE FURTHER ADVISED THAT THEIR INVESTIGATION WAS CLOSED AND NO OTHER INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED. WILLIAMSPORT WEATHER BUREAU SENT A PILOT ALOFT AT APPROX: 1333 HOURS WINDS WERE THE NORTHWEST AT FORTY KNOTS THE WILLIAMSPORT WEATHER BUREAU SIGHT OF THE THEIR WEATHER BALLOON AT 17,922 FT COMPUTATIONS BY THE WEATHER BUREAU WITH THE WINDS AT THE TIME THE WEATHER BUREAU LOST SIGHT OF BALLOON AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE WILLIAMSPORT WEATHER STATION. IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE WEATHER BALLOON WAS IN THE VICINITY AT THE TIME THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED.

The text in the document is as follows:

IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OBSERVED THAT THERE WERE FOUR (4) FLYING DISCS WHICH FLEW QUITE LOW OVER THE AIR BASE IN A CIRCULAR FORMATION WHILE THE FOURTH AIRCRAFT FLEW IN A CIRCLE TO THE REAR OF THE AIRLINER. THE OBJECTS DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE COME FROM NOR DID THEY GO TO ANY EXISTING AIR BASES OR LANDMARKS ON THE GROUND NEAR THE AIRLINER. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FLYING IN FORMATION WHILE THE FOURTH AIRCRAFT FLEW IN A CIRCLE TO THE REAR OF THE AIRLINER. THESE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME SIZE AS THE AIRLINER, IF NOT LARGER. IN COLOR, THE DISCS WERE SILVERY, FOUR (4) FLYING DISCS. THREE (3) OF THESE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FLYING IN FORMATION WHILE THE FOURTH AIRCRAFT FLEW IN A CIRCLE TO THE REAR OF THE AIRLINER. THESE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME SIZE AS THE AIRLINER, IF NOT LARGER. IN COLOR, THE DISCS WERE SILVERY. THE FOUR UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FLYING IN FORMATION UNTIL THEY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. WITNESS FURTHER STATED, VERY QUIET, ANOTHER AIRCRAFT WAS SIGHTED WITHOUT INCIDENT BY THE WITNESS. FIFTEEN (15) MINUTES LATER FLYING ATTACKS OF SOME UNSPECIFIED NATURE OCCURRED.
