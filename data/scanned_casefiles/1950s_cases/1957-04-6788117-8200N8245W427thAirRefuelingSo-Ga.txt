UFOB 1PD A PD SHAPE OF OBJECT NOT TO CLEAR CMM DUE TO BLURRED
EDGES IT APPEARED HOWEVER THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN TRIANGLER OR SQUARE
PD BRILLIANCE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE EXACT SHAPE PD B PD
SIZE OF OBJECT APPEARED ABOUT ONE TENTH OF A HALF MOON IF BOTH WERE
AT SAME ALTITUDE PD C PD COLOR WAS SIMILAR TO THE MOON EXCEPT ABOUT
TWICE MOON'S BRILLIANCE WHEN FIRST NOTICED PAREN 2202 PAREN PD
AT THE TIME IT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY PD D PD ONLY ONE WAS
SIGHTED PD E PD NO FORMATION PD F PD BRILLIANCE MADE IT DIFFICULT
TO DETERMINE ANY EXACT DETAILS PD BLURRED EDGES MADE IT APPEAR TO
HAVE SEVERAL SHAPES CMM TRIANGLER CMM SQUARE AND EVEN ELONGATED PD

G PD NO TAIL CMN TRAIL OR EXHAUST WAS SEEN PD H PD NO SOUND WAS HEARD PD I PD OBJECT AT FIRST APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AND THEN IT APPEARED TO BE ASCENDING PAREN 22@5Z PAREN AND LOSING SIGHT

BRILLIANCE PD THERE WAS NO RADICAL CHANGE BUT IRREGULAR PATH SLOWLY DRIFTING EASTWARD PD AT 2212Z OBJECT WAS LESS BRILLIANT THAN MOON

AND SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN WHEN FIRST SIGHTED PD 2213Z FIRST CELESTIAL BODY WAS SIGHTED IN THE EAST PD THE CELESTIAL BODY WAS NOT A STAR BUT BELIEVED TO BE PLANET JUPITER PD 2214Z OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ORANGE AND HALF BRILLIANT AS MOON CMN CHANGING COLOR RAPIDLY AND DIMINISHING IN SIZE RAPIDLY PD 2218Z SLIGHTLY SMALLER AND LESS BRILLIANT THAN THE PLANET JUPITER PD 2224Z OBJECT STILL DIMLY IN SIGHT PD GIVES EFFECT OF THIRD RATE STAR PD OBJECT MOVED ABOUT 5 DEGREES EASTWARD FROM WHEN FIRST SIGHTED AND APPEARED TO BE ASCENDING MORE RAPIDLY PD AT THIS TIME OTHER CELESTIAL BODIES WERE SIGHTED AND THE UFO APPEARED TO BE MOVING OUTWARD PD 2 PD A PD ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY THE FACT THAT IT WAS DAYLIGHT CMN ONLY

A HALF MOON CMN IT WAS NOT A STAR NOR A PLANET NOR ANY WEATHER EQUIP

PD B PD OBSERVED ELEVATION WAS 30 TO 85 DEGREES CMN OBSERVED AZIMUTH ABOUT 30 DEGREES WHEN FIRST DISCOVERED PD C PD OBSERVED ELEVATION REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME PD AZIMUTH ABOUT 35 DEGREES WHEN OUT OF SIGHT PD D PD HOVERING WHEN FIRST SEEN CMN THEN ASCENDING SLOWLY THEN VERY RAPIDLY PD DRIFTED ABOUT 5 DEGREES EASTWARD PD E PD DISAPPEARANCE DUE TO VERY SMALL SIZE AND OUT OF SIGHT PD F PD IN SIGHT ABOUT 25 MINUTES PAREN 2000Z TO 2225Z PAREN PD 3 PD A PD
