REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIABLE FLYING OBJECT

This report is submitted in the belief that I observed a satellite or "Sputnik" sighting which was in an orbit contrary or opposite to the two "Sputniks" now circling the earth.

On 5 December 1957, I was driving North on the New York Thruway and was one mile south of the Saugataurics exit. The object was observed to appear to lift, or east, of the bottom star in the Big Dipper. This, the constellation was projected parallel to the horizon and the two stars on the right side of the dipper were pointing upward to the North Star.

It was to the left of the bottom star in the dipper that the object appeared at 1958 EST.

The object moved from this position to my left (west thru the dipper) at a constant elevation of about 20 degrees. The object passed a rather bright star or planet in the west (not Venus, Venus was lower on the horizon) and continued movement south of west until it disappeared in the dimmer of two bright stars south of west.

Time of initial sighting was approximately 1958 EST, the object passed the bright westerly star or planet at 1956 EST (an azimuth arc of approximately 80 degrees) and disappeared at 1959 EST after traveling another azimuth arc of approximately 15 degrees. The elevation arc was relatively constant at about 20 degrees. My watch was "hacked" 30 seconds fast.

The object was not a point source of light but appeared to have length. It did not twinkle but its brilliance fluctuated slightly. It was at the brightest in the center part of its travel. The color was off-white or yellowish.

The image appears to contain handwritten text, but no photograph. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text found in the document:

The object appeared to move very fast, and no sound (of jet exhaust) was heard. The speed of movement from north to west was much faster than the speed of movement from a point west to 10 degrees or 15 degrees south of west. This indicated direction from NE to SW. The object appeared to be very distant and did not compare at all with other aircraft sightings in the area at the time.
