Like if they had in side lights.
One thing I know they are close
to be 50 meters in Dim. the

You can imagine the altitude,
no bigger no smaller, just the right size.
Is this! or do I?

Once I tell about that if we ever saw any "flying Saucers" or any thing that look like a "flying Disk" I will write you a note about it at once. By happening on the first day of November 1957. A.M.

But if you want the names of all who saw it I'll get them. I made several copies of it. If that will help you.

I saw one thing I'll try to describe it in flying. Disk. I was now if just saw it 15 to 20 seconds. I have seen it in one time I just saw it. Believe me the Mexican Air Force saw it.
