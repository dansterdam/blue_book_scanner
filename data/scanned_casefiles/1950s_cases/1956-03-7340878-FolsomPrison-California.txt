One wing shaped object, approximately the size of a B-29 a/c, black in color with red and white lights emitted a jet like noise. Prisoners thought it to be a flying wing. The object came from the southeast, made one orbit over Folsom Prison, then headed northwest. Then after four minutes of observation (total time) the object faded from sight.
No report in file.
