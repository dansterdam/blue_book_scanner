Intermittent bright light traveling at a speed estimated at over one thousand (1000) MPH, emitting no sound, except when first sighted a thunder type sound was noted.

During the flight path from south to north-north-west a bright light was observed about a very twenty degrees of arc from the observer and no lights between these points.

Owing to the dark sky no object was visible.

Ref: (a) COMFOUR Instruction 3820.1a of 19 Nov 1952

1. In compliance with reference (a) the following is reported:

a. Intermittent bright light traveling at a speed estimated at over one thousand miles per hour emitting no sound, except when first sighted a thunder-type sound was heard. Approached from southwest, made slight turn and disappeared in northwest direction. A bright light was observed about every twenty degrees of arc from the observer and no lights between these points. The light, when on, seemed to grow less intense two, three, or four times. Time the light was on seemed each time was two to five seconds. Owing to the dark sky no object was visible.

b. Observed at 2215 DST, 20 May 1955 from thirty seconds to a minute and a half.

c. Observed visually from the ground.

d. Observed three miles northwest of Malvern, Pa. Object approached from direction of Exton, Pa., at altitude of approximately 7000 to 10,000 ft. and passed overhead and then turned slightly towards a northerly heading and disappeared in a north-northeast heading.

e. Observed by CDR W. H. Hilands, USN. Twenty years Naval aviator experience.

f. Weather -- Clear dark sky with stars visible in all areas, except in area passed Exton where a light low cloud condition existed.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Intermittent bright light traveling at a speed estimated at over one thousand (1000) MPH, emitting no sound, such when first sighted a thunder type sound was noted. During the flight path from south to north-northwest a light path was observed about twenty (20) degrees of arc from the observer and no lights between these points. Owing to the dark sky no object was visible.

11. COMMENTS
Due to the elapsed time of over 3month between date of sighting and date of initial report to this headquarters, and the improbability of further investigation uncovering data of significant value, no investigation authorized by this headquarters. It is possible that the observer sighted an aircraft, possibly jet, crossing the sky at a high rate of speed with its running lights flashing on and off.
