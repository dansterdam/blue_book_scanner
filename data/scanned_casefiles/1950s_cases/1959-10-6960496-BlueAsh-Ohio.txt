Dayton, Ohio.

Sirs:

For your information-

On Sunday 11 October 1959, at about 10:00 am EST while working at the Blue Ash, Ohio airport (which is about 50 miles SSW of WPAFD) I saw that was apparently a stationary UFO.

I first saw this object while looking at a C-47 heading NE over the airport. The C-47 passed between the object and myself. The object appeared to be an exceptionally bright star.

Having fixed the location of the object I obtained a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars.

Using the binoculars magnified the object considerably. (It has been my experience that binoculars do not perceptably magnify a star.)

The object appeared to be spherical, silver, possibly metallic, and nearly as bright as the sun, the brightest side being toward the sun.

Using the magnetic compass on an airplane I determined the object to be about 200 degrees magnetic from the airport. And, then using a vernier protractor (which is normally used to adjust problems) found the object to be 57.1 degrees above the horizon.

I watched the object for about 20 minutes and it did not appear to move.

Then, with this information I telephoned Cincinnati Approach Control and spoke to _____, one of the radar observers.

He attempted to establish a radar fix, both with normal and MFI radar.

He said he was unable to establish anything.

The object appeared to be stationary for another 10 minutes and then due to the demands of our business we quit watching.

About an hour later, having the opportunity to look again, the object was gone. I scanned the sky with binoculars through the area in which the object would be if it had been a star, and saw nothing.

The weather was clear, unlimited visibility, and quite windy.

Here is the text from the document:

There were eight of us who saw the object. We all have aeronautical experience.

We all agree with the foregoing with one exception, the exception is that several of those who saw the object through the binoculars said the object was oval rather than round.

I attribute this difference to the extreme brilliance of the object and to the aberration of the binoculars.

I have in the past on two other occasions seen UFO's.

On the latter of these two occasions I saw a UFO while flying a light airplane. Both my passengers and I saw the object between ourselves and the ground, some distance ahead of our aircraft.

I was able to take a color picture ( a Kodachrome stereo transparency) of the object at this time.

I hope the foregoing information will be of some value in any investigation of the UFO's.

If I could answer any more questions on these sightings please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
Cincinnati 24, Ohio.
