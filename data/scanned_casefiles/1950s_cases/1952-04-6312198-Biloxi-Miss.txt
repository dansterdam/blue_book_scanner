SWORN STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED
22 April 1952

V. C. Maccaull. Wariant Eng., New Mexico, 783th Aircraft Control and Warning Sqdn, advises the following statement:

At 1315 MST, 13 April 1952, an observation was directed to an aircraft, which I thought to be a jet, flying at approximately 15,000-20,000 feet in the direction of the city. The object was something extraordinary due to its maneuverability. It rose rapidly to about 40,000 feet almost vertically, stopped, and then dropped suddenly to about 5,000 feet. It again rose rapidly to 40,000 feet, only to drop again. It repeated these maneuvers several times. It was a bright, silvery object, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and without any visible markings, wings, tail, or other conventional aircraft features. I cannot go into any great detail as to its structure.

As I have the approximate path or flight of the object was in sight from my position, but I still could not determine its nature. 

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 22nd day of April 1952.

OCR Text Output:

1. S/S 22 April 1952
This is the statement of Capt USAF, ____________, Biloxi, Miss referring to sighting of unidentified aircraft control and movement as reported to the Aircraft Control and Radar units on above date.

On 22 April 1952 I was engaged in routine training flights over the Gulfport area. At approximately 0130 csr time, my attention was attracted to a strange object in the sky. This object was pointed out to me by another observer, and at that time it seemed to be hovering in the sky. As I observed this object, it gradually moved away, appearing to climb at a tremendous rate of speed. The object gave off a bluish white glow which seemed to light up the sky for quite some distance. There was no sound or exhaust as would be expected from a jet, propeller, or rocket type aircraft. The color seemed to be a brilliant bluish white, as I have described, and remained constant throughout the observation. The object made absolutely no sound and maintained a steady and rapid rate of climb which I would estimate to be in excess of 2000 mph. There was no deviation or change in direction, and the object seemed to disappear in the northeastern sky.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 22nd day of April 1952.
