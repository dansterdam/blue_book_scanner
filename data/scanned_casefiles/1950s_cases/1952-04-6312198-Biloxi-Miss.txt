AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: UNITED STATES
REPORT NO: Not Applicable
AREA REPORTED ON: Albuquerque ABLE                FROM (Group): Aircraft Control And Warning Squadron

DATE OF REPORT: 21 April 1952     DATE OF INFORMATION: 13 April 1952     EVALUATION:

PREPARED BY (Officer): [Redacted] Captain, USAF     SOURCE: Visual Ground Observation

SUMMARY:
SUBJECT: Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

In accordance with ADC Ltr. 200-1, Reporting of Unconventional Aircraft, dated 21 April 1951, the following is forwarded your headquarters in los in-

13 April 1952

At 1645 MST, a strange object was sighted in the sky by several members of this organization. The object was described as circular and flat in shape; metallic or silver in color; of a size that could not be easily calculated.

There was only one (1) such object reported; there was no trail or exhaust observed, and apparently no sound to be heard. All observations were impressed most by its high speed and maneuverability.

This was a visual sighting from the ground and the ground observation was at the 769th ACCS Sqdn. area, Moriarity, New Mexico, in front of the Glinter hall. The visual contact can be considered conclusive and the personnel involved can be considered reliable as far as the organization is concerned.

Significance of Incident:
Four (4) individuals saw this object, all four (4) individuals were with and are familiar with modern aircraft; the object did not in any way resemble a modern conventional or jet aircraft.

SWORN                 STATEMENT                 UNCLASSIFIED                 22 April 1952

I, [REDACTED], 738th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Moriarty, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:

Upon leaving the dining hall, 18 April 1952, my attention was directed to an aircraft, which I thought to be a jet type. After observing this object for approximately four to five minutes, I knew that this was something extraordinary due to its maneuverability. Once during the five minutes I lost sight of it and in no time at all it showed up a great distance away from the point where I last sight of him. My idea of its structure is so confusing, seeing that I could not make out this object. Also, due to the distance at which I observed this object, I cannot go into any great detail as to its structure.

Attached hereon is the approximate path of flight the object was in as I saw it.

SHORT NARRATIVE

UNCLASSIFIED                                   22 April 1952

I, S/Sgt [redacted], 768th Aircraft Control and
Warning Squadron, Moriarty, New Mexico, do hereby with to make the
following statement:

On 18 April 1952, while leaving the mesa hall a strange type of
aircraft was pointed out by another airman. This aircraft was
circular in shape and flat, flying on edge. I was unable to estimate
the size but the color was unmistakably silver. There was no sound or
exhaust trail. The features which struck me as so unusual was the
curvability and speed. The aircraft followed an extremely erratic
flight pattern. As well as I could observe it remained in level flight
for only a matter of seconds. The remarkable turn was upon its other
climbing or diving. I was able to observe this aircraft for approximately three minutes until it flew out of sight.

Attached hereto is the flight pattern the aircraft took as I saw it.

S/Sgt, AF [redacted]

SUMMARY:

1. At approximately 2107 hours CST on 13 April 1952, while seated in a parked automobile located at approximately 15.3 miles S and 12 miles W of Keesler AFB, Robert O. Wilson, AO-562138, sighted three (3) unidentified objects in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico, south of above mentioned geographical location. The objects were reported as being three (3) in number, round in shape, and dull orange (compared by the observer as being similar to the color of faded red). In color. The observer was unable to determine the size of the objects, distance from him, or altitude of the objects. According to the observer, the objects were moving.

2. The period of observation was estimated as being from four (4) to five (5) seconds. The objects traversed the sky in a straight line. After approximately three (3) seconds, the objects appeared to change their formation on other than pattern and then vanished from sight. The observer could distinguish no definite sound coming from the objects, no maneuvers (except as noted above) no conclusion of distinguishing features were noted.

STATEMENT

UNCLASSIFIED

I, [redacted], 168th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Moriarty, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On 13 April 1952, I was coming out of the Squadron Mess Hall when I saw what looked like a flying saucer. The time was about 1645 mountain standard time. The object was traveling at an unestimated speed and at what looked like to be flying at approximately 40,600 feet. The object was visible until it turned sideways at which time it disappeared because of it's saucer like shape. After approximately five (5) to ten (10) minutes after sighting subject object it disappeared.

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 22nd day of April 1952.

Report of Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects

Information Pertinent to Objects Sighted:

1. Shape:
   The shape of the objects sighted was reported as being round, "like balls of light".

2. Size:
   No estimation of the size of the objects sighted was advanced by the observer due to his inability to determine accurately the altitude or distance away of the objects.

3. Color:
   The objects appeared to be a dull orange color, comparable to the glow of heated metal.

4. Number:
   Three (3).

5. Trail or exhaust:
   None observed.

6. Propulsion system:
   None observed.

7. Speed:
   No estimation of speed was made by observer due to lack of knowledge concerning distance and altitude. However, (unexpectedly) the observer has estimated the speed to have been very fast.

8. Sounds:
   Negative

9. Maneuvers:
   Straight line formation, flying straight across the sky. See 10 below.

10. Manner of Disappearance:
    After approximately three (3) seconds in sight of the observer, the objects appeared to change formation or alter their pattern and then vanish from sight to 1 year. (Change of formation or pattern not remembered by observer.)

At the top of the page, there is partially legible text that appears to read "Altitude in thousand of feet" on both the left and right sides of the document.

The majority of the page is a grid or graph paper with very faint gridlines. Most of the text and markings on the grid are too faint or blurry to be reliably read through OCR.


- page 36 -

Visible text:

ADRIATIC CHART
MEAN SEA

The image appears to be a grid chart with numerical markings on the left and top sides. The chart looks like a coordinate or mapping grid with fine lines creating small squares across the entire page. The top right corner contains the text "ADRIATIC CHART" and "MEAN SEA" in faint text.


- page 37 -

At the top of the document, I can partially read "ADMINISTRATIVE CHART" though the text is somewhat faint.

The document appears to be a form with multiple grid sections and tables, but most of the text is too illegible to accurately transcribe. There are grid lines, boxes, and sections, but the specific details within those sections are not clear enough to read with confidence.

At the bottom of the document, there appears to be some text, but it is too blurry to make out specific words or letters.

The rest of the text is partially legible but difficult to read clearly due to the image quality. The document appears to be a precipitation data sheet with columns for dates and measurements, but the specific details are not easily discernible.

In the top right corner, there are some partially visible numbers that look like dates: "12 APR 52" and what might be "1952" and some other numbers.

The document is a black and white table with multiple rows and columns, typical of a meteorological record-keeping form from the 1950s.

STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, authorized to administer oaths in cases of this nature, First Lieutenant [redacted], 3606th Student Squadron, 3306th Technical Training Group, Mobile Air Force Base, Mississippl, and upon being warned of his rights under the 31st Article, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and upon being duly sworn according to law, made the following voluntarily sworn statements:

"While attending the Beach Drive-in Theater on the night of 13 April, I, First Lieutenant [redacted], and my wife, sighted three unidentified objects in the sky out over the Gulf of Mexico, south of our location. The objects appeared to be in a formation or defined pattern, much in shape of a dull orange color similar to the glow of heated metal, and were traveling west. The objects appeared to be approximately thirty (30) degrees in elevation. The objects were within my sight for approximately four (4) to ten (10) seconds. After approximately three (3) seconds, the objects appeared to change formation or alter their pattern and then vanished from sight to my right (west).

"I believe that the possibility of sighted objects being confused with falling stars is precluded by the direct horizontal path of the objects sighted and the difference in color between a star and the sighted objects".

1st Lt, USAF
