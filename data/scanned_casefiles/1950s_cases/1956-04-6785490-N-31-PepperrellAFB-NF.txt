OF THE ABOVE PERSONNEL, SGT. DUFFY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS HAD
FORMAL WEATHER TRAINING, HAVING ATTENDED WEATHER SCHOOL FOR SIX
ONTHS. WEATHER AT M-31 AT 0817: CLEAR, 15 MILES VISIBILITY UP
TEMPERATURE -4, DEW POINT -6, WINDS WERE CALM, ALTITUDE 3°-43 THE
DURATION OF THIS SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY FROM 430' 430' TO 5827.
EXTIMATED POSITION IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT 64 45', 66 42". ESTIMATED
ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT WAS 500 FEET, AND THE SPEED APPROXIMATELY 30
KNOTS. DUE TO THE LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE OBJECT IT WAS DIFFICULT
TO ASCERTAIN THE SPEED AND ALTITUDE. THE OBJECT FLASHED GREY BRIGHT-
LY AT TIMES, LIGHTING THE SKY FOR MANY TIMES, THEN THE LIGHT DE-
CREASED SO THAT THE OBJECT WAS BARELY VISIBLE. THIS FLASHING OF
THE OBJECT CONTINUED SEVERAL TIMES, THE MOST PREDOMINANT COLOR BEING
RED. OTHER COLORS WERE ALSO SEEN, PARTICULARLY ORANGE AND BLUE.
THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY CIRCULAR. THE OBJECT'S
MOTIONS WERE PECULIAR I NOTED VERTICALLY. THE HEADING OF THE
OBJECT WAS NORTH, NORTH-EAST. RADAR CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT WAS NEVER
ESTABLISHED.
