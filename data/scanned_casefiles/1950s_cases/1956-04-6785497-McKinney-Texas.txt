Also disappeared w/setting of sun. Obj similar to balloon. Bright silver w/band around middle. Band did not rotate but had same position thru/out sighting. High cirrus clouds appeared at 1900. Thru TX looked 4X 24 glass looked solid.

Dear Sir:

Attached hereto is a sketch of an unidentified flying object seen over this city, or apparently over it, on April 14, 1956. Efforts have been made to identify the UFO, hence the delay of sending this report.

The UFO was called to my attention, as I am the local Weather Bureau observer, and I noted it at 8:15 P.M. on the afternoon of the date named above. It was apparently an egress northward of zenith from McKinney, and I at first thought it was a weather radiosonde balloon. On calling the Fort Worth Weather Bureau however, I learned that there were no weather ballons in the air in this vicinity. I then decided it was far higher than at first I believed, and ran a base of three miles for a tri angulation reading. The angles showed little or no convergence, and I ran another base line of the same length. This latter triangulation showed, so far as I could determine with my old prismatic compass, a convergence of about three degrees. This placed the UFO some 100,000 feet up. With an old rifle telescope I took several readings and finally worked the object out as 'standing somewhere near a minute or so, making it over 200 feet in diameter.

An amateur astronomer here placed his 200-power telescope on the UFO and drew a sketch of it for me. I am sending you a copy of this. The astronomer said it apparently was moving westward at about 100 miles per hour, though the upper air currents were blowing toward the east far greater than that. I noted the UFO from 8:15 P.M. until dark. I saw it was in opposition with the planet Venus, which I saw while watching the UFO; and about seven degrees due north of the planet. As the planet traveled westward the UFO kept its station with respect to Venus—seven degrees north: I am inclined to think that with the astronomer's (illegible) interpretation was movement was the rotation of the earth, turning away from the UFO.

Now, a most peculiar phenomenon connected with the UFO was the fact that it did not rotate all afternoon. The raised band around its middle remained stationary-north and south. There were no apparent attachments to the UFO whatever. It glistened in the sunlight like silver, though Mr. Anderson said it looked as if it was made of transparent, silvery rubber. I did not observe it through the telescope, only through a four-power glass. So far as I was able to determine, the UFO did not change its position with respect to the planet Venus at any time; and when it finally disappeared, about (illegible) degrees from its original position.

Here is the text from the document:

The UFO was so high that it glowed in the sunlight long after dark on the earth's surface. There were some cirrus clouds in the upper strata 7:00 P.M. and it was at above them. I had ascertained their height to be 11,000 feet. My rough calculations may have been off, of course, and I think they possibly were. I am inclined to believe the UFO was at least 100 miles high, as I have talked to observers as far west as 100 miles and north 50, and all them say it appeared overhead to them.

I have contacted the Weather Bureau, the Air Force bases at Carswell Base and Perrin Field and all of them say they do not have any information on the UFO--don't know what it was. It was gone on the morning of April 5.

So much for that. Now another:

On April 6, two days after the above-mentioned UFO was seen, [redacted] Street, this city, and a companion were driving five miles east of McKinney they saw a silvery object, first to eight feet in diameter, slant down a field 100 yards from them. They stopped the car and the UFO took off at a terrific speed and disappeared. They thought it resembled a balloon.

Another: On the night of April 13, nine days after the UFO was sighted over the city, I was at Mr. [redacted] house looking at cars with him through his telescope. Starting to leave at 9:15 P.M. I saw two red lights shoot low over the house tops to the south. I at first took them to be jets, but by the time I realized they could not possibly be, they had disappeared to the west. I could not ascertain how far away they were, so said nothing, save to ask Anderson if he has seen them or heard and planes. He said not. A few days later a local man called me, Mr. [redacted], called and asked if I had seen any strange lights over the city at the time and date named above. I asked him, without leading him to believe I had seen them, just what they looked like and their direction. He said they were pale blue and traveling west overhead. He said there were three of them, and they made no sound so far as he could hear. With the UFO triangled on, I could estimate their height and speed. They were about 150 feet above the ground and, as they traveled over an arc of about 40 degrees in the estimated two seconds there I observed them, they were making somewhere in the vicinity of 1,800 m.p.h. Mr. [redacted] viewing them from below, said there were three of them, and the glowed pale blue. I only saw two and they were red.

In addition to all this, I would like to state that I am no believer in flying saucers, but am admitting this for what it may be worth in view of the data you already have on hand concerning U.S.

Yours sincerely,
Captain U.S. Army, Retd.

Dear Sir:

Attached hereto is a sketch of an unidentified flying object seen over this city, or apparently over it, on April 4, 1956. Efforts have been made to identify the UFO, hence the delay of sending this report.

The UFO was called to my attention, as I am the local Weather Bureau observer, and I noted it at 2:15 P.M. on the afternoon of the date named above. It was apparently ten degrees northwest of zenith from McKinney, and I at first thought it was weather radiosonde below. On calling the Fort Worth Weather Bureau, however, I learned that there were no weather balloons in the air in this vicinity. I then decided it was far higher than at first I believed, and ran a base of three miles for a triangulation reading. The angles showed little or no convergence, and I ran another base line of the same length. This latter triangulation showed, so far as I could determine with my old prismatic compass, a convergence of about three degrees. This placed the UFO some 100,000 feet up. With the old rifle telescope I took several readings and finally worked the object out a subtending some near a minute of arc, making it over 200 feet in diameter.

An amateur astronomer here placed his 200-power telescope on the UFO and drew a sketch of it for me. I am sending you a copy of this. The astronomer said it apparently was moving vestward at about 100 miles per hour, though the upper air currents were blowing toward the east far greater than that. I noted the UFO from 3:15 P.M. until dark. I saw it was in opposition with the planet Venus, which I saw this watching the UFO, and between degrees due north of the planet. As the planet traveled westward the UFO kept its station with respect to Venus--seven degrees north. I am inclined to think that with the astronomer's observation, this city, interpreted as movement was the rotation of the earth, turning away from the UFO.

Now, a most peculiar phenomenon connected with the UFO was the fact that it did not rotate all afternoon. The raised bend around its middle remained stationary--both north and south. There were no pendages attached to the UFO whatever. It glistened in the sunlight like silver, though Mr. _______ said it looked as if it was made of translucent, silvery rubber. I did not observe through the telescope, only through a four-power glass. So far as I was able to determine, the UFO did not change its position with respect to the planet Venus at any time, and when it finally disappeared, about 9:00 P.M., it was in the same relative position.

I could not ascertain how far away there were, so said nothing, save to ask Anson if he had seen them or heard planes. He had not. A few days later a local man called me, like _______, and said he had seen any strange lights over the city at the time and date named above.

I have contacted the Weather Bureau, the Air Force bases at Carswell, Case and Perrin Field and all of them say they do not have any information on the UFO--don't know what it was. It was gone on the morning of April 5.

So much for that. Now another:

On April 6, two days after the above-mentioned UFO was seen, Mr. [redacted] [redacted] Street, this city, and a companion were driving five miles east of McKinney this; they saw a silvery object, five to eight feet in diameter, along an area 100 yards from them.
