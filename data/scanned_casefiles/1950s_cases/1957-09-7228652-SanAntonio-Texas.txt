THE U.S. WEATHER BUREAU RELEASED ONE WEATHER BALLOON AT 23307
14 SEPTEMBER 1957. THERE WAS ALSO ONE UNUSUAL WEATHER CONDITION.

WHEN THE SUN WAS SETTING, IT'S RAYS WERE BOUNCING OFF OF SOME
SMOKE LAYERS CAUSING A COLOR VARIATION FROM BLUE TO GRAY. THE
WEATHER BUREAUS' OPINION IS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SMALL ENOUGH
TO APPEAR AS SMALL ROUND OBJECTS EVEN FROM QUITE A DISTANCE.

ITEM NINE-NONE. ITEM TEN-ONE COMMERCIAL AIRLINER, FOUR ENGINED.
ITEM ELEVEN-NO UNUSUAL OBJECTS APPEARED ON RADAR. ITEM TWELVE-NONE.
