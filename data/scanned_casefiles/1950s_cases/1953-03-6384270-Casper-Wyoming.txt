Here is the OCR text from the document:

Q. When you saw it, where was it flying?
A. (To. ______) Towards the south and south. It was about 10 degrees south of southwest. I leaned against the building and took a sight across a light pole to see. I was steady, and I got a fairly good view of the direction. I was going just a little south of southeast, but I saw variation when in a constant position both to the right and left and up and down in an indefinite pattern. I mean of the location was about two or three miles away. I noticed by eye to estimate the variation which I supposed to be about two to five hundred feet of direct change.

Q. You did not attempt to try to pause between telephone lines, etc.?
A. (To. ______) There was no arrangement to get an accurate pause.

Q. You were once in a balloon outfit, in field or Y. You know how they swung?
A. (To. ______) Yes.

Q. Have either of you ever flown an aircraft?
A. (To. ______) No.
(To. ______) Several times.

Q. Have you seen jet aircraft at night?
A. (To. ______) Yes.
(To. ______) I do not recall whether I have or not, but I have in the daylight.

Q. You have seen jet aircraft at night. Did this resemble the tail cone at night?
A. (To. ______) No, not at all. The only brilliance I saw at all except in the center of the ball was a radiant, reflecting beam as in a store. They were quite distinct but were very quickly become iridescent and died away, as the object, or rather away.

Q. You said the light seemed to be somewhat intermittent or on and off?
A. (To. ______) It would flick off for just a second, pick in a regular blinking pattern as to intervals.

Q. How would you say was the elapsed time from the time you saw it until it disappeared?
A. (To. ______) Not over five minutes from the first sight until disappearance.
(To. ______) I saw it about three minutes.

And now to the 2nd batch; of 26 March 53:

In the 2nd batch, only 2 are Venus: 13 (Wartbayville) and 19 (Cape Vincent) March. There is a possibility that also the 15 March, Germany, was the star Sirius. Most interesting to me is March 18, Williams AFB. This one could be a Kenzel mirage. Would be interesting to know elevation above horizon. Would be interesting to have questionnaire filled out on this one. I f the heading had been 270° instead of 90°, these might very well have been Sundogs. My guess is, however, that this was some sort of meteorological phenomena.

Now as to the remainder, the 23 March Casper could have been a meteor if the reported 2 minutes is in error. Now large was the disk? Does altitude here refer to elevation? 'What is your opinion of this one?

The 15 March Courtlands could have been a meteor. The short time of observation seems to make follow-up not worthwhile.

The 19 March Newfoundland case is very interesting, but only one observer. The fact that the measured cells was 2700 feet a limit mx to height. Here any witnesses? If so, this would be worthwhile following up.

The 18 March Great Falls, Mont., gives us another Nocturnal Meandering Light. Can a balloon be ruled out? I think a questionnaire here would be appropriate. Maybe you ought to station a special observer at Great Falls!

The 19 March Tanawanda has insufficient data. The 21 March Elmira is quite interesting but observed only a few seconds. I don't see how Henzel can explain this one.

The 13 March Maxwell AFB has insufficient evidence.

Finally, the 14 March Greenville, could be a balloon.

In both batches there are 3 cases I should personally like to follow up. Those are Shaw AFB, 5 March; Vins AFB 18 March; and 18 March Great Falls.

My plan, Lieutenant, is to concentrate on relatively few cases that show promise of affording scientific data. I purposely want to keep the number of cases down for obvious reasons of time limitation. If it becomes possible to obtain the services of one full time assistant, then I could assign certain follow up jobs which would facilitate matters a great deal.

I hope we can discuss those and other matters at your visit here 22 April.

Best Wishes,

Sincerely,
[Signature]

P.S. Any further word on the Fort Austin Case of 17 Feb?
I should appreciate talking with Dr. Kaplan concerning the Kenzel plan.

[Handwritten note at bottom]
Write - Ask about Austin by Tex if the flight may have been a helicopter, asking why or what helicopter activity, companies, mail runs, etc.

1. Reference letter this detachment subject case as above dated 25 March 1953. A following report is being made of an additional sighting in the case location.

2. The object sighted this time was mostly like the one previously sighted but did not travel in the same direction nor in the same manner. One of the witnesses was the same (Mrs. [redacted]) as in the initial report but another witness has been added.

3. In an interview with Mrs. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted] the following information was determined:

a. The object appears as a bright orange light with no ground lighting.

b. It move very fast but no estimate of speed.

c. The object acted like it was surveying the Air Base from the air and ranged back and forth over the base like a hunting dog.

d. It appeared on an initial course of fast then ranged the base to the North and South then disappeared in the distance going East.

e. Just before passing out of the immediate vicinity of the air base it climbed very rapidly emitting rays or jets.

f. No air traffic or weather balloons in area of time of sighting.

g. Time and date of sighting: 0125 HOURS 28 Mar 53.

h. Persons sighting:

(1) Mrs. [redacted], Casper, Natrona County, Wyoming. Airway (Casper Air Base) Company, Jeannie is a College Graduate in Psychology was in Air Corps during World War II and has flown as passenger in many civil and military aircraft and was stationed at Boeing Aircraft Plant in Washington for some time.

(2) Mrs. [redacted], Casper, Wyoming, a College Graduate and a Housewife.

4. From the interview it is apparent that at least four (4) intelligent and reasonable people have seen some object that is out of the ordinary. There is no evidence of weather phenomena that could cause this reaction and it is believed that further investigation by personnel more qualified in this field is warranted.

STATEMENT                                                   23 March 1953

This is a statement from and signed by [redacted], Capt. USAF, [redacted], Capt. USAF, [redacted], Commanding Officer, Detachment 4, 4772d ground observer squadron, Casper, Wyoming.

At approximately 8:30 p.m., Sunday March 22, 1953 at the Natrona County Air Base, I was sitting in a parked car facing west on the base toward the then south side of the main base. I saw a light which appeared to me to be a plane rising from the air strip beyond the nearby vertical light beam at the weather station. It appeared to be on a low altitude course. The altitude was judged by perspective that it was a plane taking off but about to crash within a quarter of a mile east of me. When I realized there were no navigational lights on this plane, I began to watch it closely. There was no sound. I watched it as almost as rapidly, and it appeared to hover slightly above the ground. I was certain it was not an ordinary plane. I was rapidly about 125 feet and called my husband out of the building. To hurried out, he also saw the object and thought it was a plane rising to a higher altitude than when I first observed it. We watched it with me for a few seconds and called to Mrs. Elizabeth Reese who was out of the building and watched the object continued its flight in a southeasterly direction over the city of Casper and on over Casper mountain and finally faded into the distance. Briefly, the object was a light which dipped northwest to southeast direction but frequently hesitated or dip-swayed slightly and vertically to right or left. Occasionally, the single light would hold for a split second at irregular intervals. By estimate of the total time the object was in sight was not more than five minutes and possibly less.

The following is a transcription of a "Question & Answer" dialogue which took place on 25 March 1953 between Mr. [redacted] of Casper, Wyoming, and Captain Merlon J. Evans, Commanding Officer, Detachment 4, 4177th USAF Crew Quarters, Casper, Wyoming.

A. (Yes, [redacted]) A single type of orange-yellow light not resembling a fire or sun. (Yes, [redacted]) It would appear that it was on an airplane lit up, but it had more of an orange color than a white electric lights. It was more like the color of a flashlight battery almost dead.
