There are no photographs present on this page. Here is the text output from the document:

Q. When you saw it, where was it flying?

A. (censored) Towards the south and south. It was about 10 degrees north of
southwest. I leaned against the building and took a sight across a light
pole top so I watched, and I got a fairly good estimate of its direction.
It was going just a little south of southwest, but I got its variation
when in a constant position with the right and left eye and came down
in the building gutter. My guess of its location was about two or three
miles away. I watched it two to three minutes which I thought to be a.
cloud due to its laminated front of different shades.

Q. You did not attempt to try to gauge between telephone lines, etc.?

A. (censored) No, there was no arrangement to get an accurate gage.

Q. You were once in a balloon cut-away in World War I. You know how they move?

A. (censored) Yes.

Q. Have either of you ever flown an aircraft?

A. (censored) No.
           (censored) Several times.

Q. Have you seen jet aircraft at night?

A. (censored) Yes.
           (censored) I do not recall whether I have or not, but I know in the
daylight.

Q. Ever seen jet aircraft at night, did this resemble the tail cone at night?

A2 (censored) No, not at all. The only brilliance I saw at all except in the
center of the tail was a radiant, reflecting lens as in a star. They were
quite distinct but very quickly became indistinct and dulled away as the
object got farther away.

Q. You said the lights seemed to be occasional intermittent on and off?

A. (censored) It would flick off for just a second, not in a regular
blinking pattern as to intervals.

Q. What would you say was the elapsed time from the time you saw it until it
disappeared?

A. (censored) Not over five minutes from the first sight until disappearance.
       (censored) I saw it about three minutes.

The image does not contain a photograph but a hand-drawn diagram or map. The diagram appears to show the layout of an area with annotations indicating directions, distances, and features related to an observation, perhaps of a UFO, as it would relate to Project Blue Book. There is a line marked as the "FLIGHT LINE" and another indicating the "Direction of Flight of Object," with a dotted line stating "Line of Initial Sight." Distance markers such as "1/2 mile" and "1/4 mile" are noted, as well as a specific point marked as "OBSERVERS." There are notations for what look like roads or paths, with labels such as "J.S.H.WY MAIN GATE TO ROBERTSON," and "9TH AVENUE." 

The handwritten text at the top reads "GROUND PLAN OF AREA AT NATRONA COUNTY AIRPORT (NOT TO SCALE)".

As for the act as an OCR system, here is the output of all the text found in the document:

The handwritten numbers and letters scattered around the edges are more difficult to read and don't provide coherent sentences but appear to be additional annotations related to the map.

And now to the 2nd batch, of 26 March 53:

In the 2nd batch, only 2 are Venus; 13^th (Hartsville) and 19^th (Cape Vincent) Both. There is a possibility that also the 15^th March, Germany, was the star Sirius. Most interesting to me is 12th 18, Williams AFB. This one could be a lense[l] mirage. Would be interesting to know elevation above horizon. Would be interesting to have questionnaire filled out on this one. If the heading had been 270° instead of 90°, these might very well have been Sundogs. My guess is, however, that this was some sort of meteorological phenomena.

Now as to the remainder, the 23 March Casper could have been a meteor if the reported 2 minutes is in error. How large was the disk? Does altitude here refer to elevation? What is your opinion of this one?

The 15 March Courtland could not have been a meteor. The short time of observation seems to make four-ty-aps not worthwhile.
The 19^th March Newfoundland case is very interesting, but only one observer. The fact that the observers ceiling was 2700 feet puts a limit on mx to height. There there any witnesses? If so, this would be worthwhile following up.
The 18^th March Great Falls, IY9.,, gives us another nocturnal incandecent light. Can a balloon be ruled out? I think extensive ground/air search would be appropriate. maybe you ought to station a special observer at Great Falls!

The 19 March Tanananda has insufficient data. The 21 March Elmira is quite interesting but observed only a few seconds. I don't see how lense[l] can explain this one.

The 13 March Maxwell AFB has insufficient evidence.
Finally, the 31^st March Greenville, could be a balloon.

In both batches there are 3 cases I should personally like to follow up. Those are Shaw AFB, 5 March; Vms AFB 18 March; and 18 March Great Falls.

My plan, Lieutenant, is to concentrate on relatively few cases that show promise of affording scientific data. I purposely want to keep the number of cases down for obvious reasons of time limitation. If it becomes possible to obtain the services of one full time assistant, then I could assign certain follow up jobs which would facilitate matters a great deal.

I hope we can discuss those and other matters at your visit here 22 April.

Best Wishes,

Sincerely,

Allan Hynek

P.S. Any further word on the Port Austin Case of 17 Feb?
I should appreciate talking with Dr. Kaplan concerning the lense[l] plan.

Note - Ask Port Austin by TWX if the object may have been a helicopter, asking info on stored helicopter activity, companies, mail runs, etc.

A.H.

Please note that there may be some transcription errors due to the quality of the document and the way letters are represented. For example, "lense[l]" is rendered with what appears to be an editorial clarification, suggesting the typed word may have been misspelled and should be "lens".

TO: Director of Intelligence
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

1. Reference letter this detachment subject same as above dated
25 March 1953. A follow-up report is being made of an additional sight-
ing from the same location.

2. The object sighted this time was exactly like the one previously
sighted but did not travel in the same direction nor in the same manner.
One of the witnesses was the same as in the initial report
but another witness has been added.

3. In an interview with Mrs. ------- and Mrs. ------- the following
information was determined:

a. The object appears as a bright orange light with no sound
sighting.

b. It moves very fast but no estimate of speed.

c. The object acted like it was surveying the Air Base from the
air and ranged back and forth over the base like a hunting dog.

d. It appeared on an initial course of East then turned the base
to the North and South then disappeared in the distance going East.

e. Just before passing out of the immediate vicinity of the Air
Base it climbed very rapidly emitting rays or jets.

f. No air traffic or weather balloons in area at time of sighting.

g. Time and date of sighting 0125 MWT 21 Mar 53.

h. Persons sighting!

Mrs. ███████ is a College Graduate in Physiology was in Air Corps during World War II and has flown as passenger in many civil and military aircraft and was stationed at Boeing aircraft plant in Washington for some time.

(2) Mrs. ██████████, █████████ Air Svc., Casper, Wyoming a College Graduate and is knowledgeable.

4. From this interview it is apparent that at least four (4) intelligent and reasonable people have seen some objects that is out of the ordinary. There is no evidence of weather phenomenon that could cause this reaction and it is believed that further investigation by personnel more qualified in this field is warranted.

The text in the document states:

3 March 1953

This is a statement from ************, Captain, USAF, currently stationed at ************.

It approximately 8:00 p.m., Friday March 23, 1951, at the Natrona County Air Base, I was sitting in a parked car facing east on the Casper side of the soda plant of the Midwest Ref. and Bulk station. It appeared to be a plane rising from the strip beyond the steady vertical lights seen at the weather stations. It appeared to fly at a low altitude over the oil base buildings. My impression was that it was a plane taking off but soon erased when a quarter of a mile (most of mile) as I realized there were no wing tip lights but only a single horizontal light, red (then orange to a vivid yellow) a myriad of stars and watched the light from a few seconds move as I cloud of cigarette smoke going to rise 1:1/2 to 2 air miles above a similar spot I had originally noted it. At this point it was low on the order of **** to *****, by about 25° and called my companion ***********. Hospitalman S.N., such that that time the object had directly over us and at a much higher altitude than when I first discovered it. I watched it with us for a few seconds and called to Ins. Elizabeth ***** who was out of the building and without with us while the object continued the climb at a spectacularly unusually over into the of Casper and Casper (maybe 7 miles) and finally faded into the distance. During the whole course of this flight, the object had remained narrowed to the southwest direction until only horizonta-(sic) line moved quickly and vertically to right one last. Occasionally, the single light would blink out for a split second with irregular intervals. My estimate of the total time the object was in sight was not more than five minutes and possibly less.

TRANSCRIPT OF CONVERSATION
25 March 1953

The following is a transcription of a "question and answer" dialogue which took place on 25 March 1953 between Lt. *****, ********* of Casper, Wyoming, and Captain Marlon D. Jensen, Commanding Officer, Detachment #6, 17072nd Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron, Casper, Wyoming.

Q. Would you give us your full name and address?

A. (Name, address, city, state)

Q. Would you give us your occupation?

A. (Name, occupation, address, city, state)

Q. When you saw this object, you said the color was yellow. Can you qualify the color of the appearance of the light? Did it resemble a search light, a flood-light, a neon or a light of a fire?

A. (Name) A single type of orange-yellow light not resembling a fire or sun. It would appear that it was an airplane with one, but it had more of an orange color than a white electric light. It was more like the color of a flashlight battery almost dead.

Q. Could you give us an idea of about the relative size it appeared when you first saw the light?

A. (Name) It would appear about the size of a normal aircraft landing light and about was 30° from it.

Q. Did there seem to be any glow?

A. (Name) Yes, there was a glow all around it.

Q. You stated as it came towards you at altitude. Did it change in its shape? Did it become oval or flat?

A. (Name) Lots that it could be distorted.

Q. Did it zig-zag before you called it ********, or after?

A. (Name) Yes, before and afterwards.

Q. When it zig-zagged, was it from side to side, or up and down?

A. (Name) It was very erratic with no pattern.
