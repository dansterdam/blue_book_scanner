Described as oval in shape, pale pink in color, and traveling at great speed, the witness noted conventional aircraft or weather balloons in vicinity at time of sighting. No celestial phenomenon noted which would account for incident. However, spotlight use local drive-in theaters reflecting against overcast sky could have produced effect similar to the one reported.
