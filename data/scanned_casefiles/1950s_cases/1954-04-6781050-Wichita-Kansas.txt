4 April, 1954
Scotland

Over British Air Ministry policy, records on Unidentified Flying Objects have been made public in the past three years. The National Investigations Committee (NICAP) officially informed, "The British policy was examined by the Air Ministry Information Division, in denying a NICAP request for 'all' JO cases.

The official details were confirmed by the Committee on April 7 to several light and two radar watching expert personnel. The radar sightings were carried on April 4 when three Air Ministry radar observers tracked an unknown object over northeastern Scotland. The operation, at three different positions, covered the UFO - flying at 40,000 feet - flashed across their radarscopes as tremendous speed.

According to Wing Commander W. P. Atherley, Royal Air Force, the object was initially tracked at Bawdsey, City, Whitby and other stations and was later confirmed to be UFO and tracked. They were able to track a solid object and its precise course could have been plotted. No official data was made available by the Air Ministry but the report was given on a strictly confidential basis to the press.

"We are investigating the matter," a Ministry official said, but little more was known. The Air Ministry was keeping the reports under a detailed review and a decision was pending.

In its reply to NICAP, however, the Air Ministry said to deny this had been its policy.

According to the G.O.C. or the R.A. U. Scotland, the sightings were tracked on April 4 and the object was displayed above the 8,000 ft. altitude. The letter two nights previously mentioned the sightings in the first case, a record of a new sighting was made by the Commander of British Coastal Artillery.

The second UFO report NICAP requested NICAP responded between a new collision between a UFO and an RAF aircraft on April 14, 1954 involving North Weald, Lane, J. R. Salcombe. On October 14, 1954 sightings near North Weald, Lane, Salcombe were discussed. UFO's near RAF was cruising at 15,000 feet. As turned back in his comments, he saw this UFO would shortly remain low.
