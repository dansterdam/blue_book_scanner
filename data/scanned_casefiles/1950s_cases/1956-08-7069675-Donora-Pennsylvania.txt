SUMMARY: (Enter summary of report. See regulation in last paragraph. List indorsers in lower left. Begin last line of report on AF Form 112 - Part II.)

11. Assistant Group Operations Staff Officer. Mr. [redacted] gave a very accurate detailed account of his sighting. He indicated his normal reluctance in reporting his sighting until he had other witnesses who would verify him. There is not much doubt that what was reported was seen but apparent cause of phenomenon could not be determined. Radar sites which covered this area, both GCI and Tower ASI, had no radar contact. The Allegheny Observatory was not operating during this period and could not verify the sighting or provide any additional data. The Donora Police were asked to investigate and verify the sighting. They visually checked to the east and northeast from their interpretation of information received and say have missed the sighting which was south. They did not know the name or address of the person making the sighting. Negative results.

12. Negative.
