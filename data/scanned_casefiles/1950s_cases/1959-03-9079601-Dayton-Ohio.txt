By the entry on my log, I read that I reported some
TLVX'S @ Bldg 252 @ 1645 and I found summarily to
the 878. I saw 4 signals & distinct continues
in the western sky very high about 700 miles
distant on a very close azm with a fifth appearing
that form the southeast and about 20 miles distant.
The sun had set, but the sun shine very bright
in the vapor trails while of apparent course in
plodge, mas. ---- clean I able now
to see vapor trails south of the position of
their sighting & laid out toward her sighting
way, the vapor trail of a jet dust rather
of a satellite.

Following is an extract from ATIC Duty Officer Captain R J Hamborsky's report dated 18 Mar 59 for your information.

1945 - Received call from Mr. [redacted], Journal Herald, requesting information on UFO. Referred him to Information Services - Washington.

1955 - Called Mrs. [redacted] for report on UFO. See separate ATIC Form 164.

2100 - Called Patterson Opns. - no help - referred me to Wx.

2102 - Called Wright Opns. - No help -

2104 - Called Pet. Service - Capt. Hill - no help.

2110 - Called 56th Intell - no help - no radar - they will call Bellefontaine and call me back - Radar (Moonshine) did not see anything but 2 F-104 pilots saw two (2) flashes in that area and thought they might be anti-aircraft.

2145 - Talked to Capt. KOOPE - F104 pilot. He saw 6 or 7 prs. of high intensity lights - other pilot saw one pr. of high intensity lights traveling fairly fast apparently on ground southwest to northwest. They were at 35,000 ft and were over Van Wert (they think) and started a turn from 210° heading to 125° heading toward Dayton. Moonshine verifies time of sighting as 01452 and GEORGE COORDINATES FM 2000.

2255 - Called Wx bureau - they released PT3AL Balloon at 1820E at estimated 40,000 - 19,000 traveling eastward and probably was east of Patterson at 1900E.

2238 - Called Cox Tower - no help.

2302 - Called Flight Test Division WADC, 50232 - no answer.
