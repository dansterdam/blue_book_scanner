Strange Objects in the Sky Above Salvador
(Folha da Tarde, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Dec 7, 1957)

Salvador, Dec 6. In this city, too, strange phenomena were observed in the sky and they are increasing since the launching of the Sputnik. Yesterday a sighting was made by both officers and men at the regional headquarters. At 13 o'clock, while the men were practicing, it was found that a planet, perhaps Mars or Venus, was quite near to the earth. The discussion attracted the attention of Major [redacted], chief of the Communications Service who decided to study the object through binoculars. He concluded that it was not one of the known planets, not only because of its shape, which remained him of the supposed bells, but also because the distance from the earth was relatively small.

Major [redacted] suddenly cried out and had other officers, including Col. [redacted], Majors [redacted], Captains [redacted] and [redacted], then look at the sky. He exclaimed that the object was divided into two parts and that the lower one first seemed to move towards the earth, and then moved towards the south. For some time, the remaining part of the object stayed in the same position, unchanged, and then followed the other ones.

The newspaperman [redacted] who was present during the last phase of the observations and heard the explanation that the metal body looked like aluminum. Today, however, the military men refused to make any statement to the press.
