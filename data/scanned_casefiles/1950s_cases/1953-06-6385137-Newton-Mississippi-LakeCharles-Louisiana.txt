8 June 1953                                                  Newton, Mississippi

Description

On the night of 2 June 1953 at approximately 2251 hours a Convair F-89 type aircraft No. 1931 was on a round-robin flight from Ellington AFB Base to Tucalocsa, Alabama. The aircraft was on a course approximately 58 degrees magnetic moving in a northeast direction at an altitude of 3000 feet. The aircraft was 7½ miles south-southeast of Newton, Mississippi, when a watchman-green light attracted the pilot's attention.

The light had the appearance of an aircraft's navigational light and was estimated to be from 5 to 7 miles from the aircraft. The object was visible for a period of 12 to 15 seconds. The pilot thought the light was on aircraft's navigational light and that it seemed to be on a parallel course with the aircraft. The light appeared to brighten, and the pilot, thinking it was an aircraft turning into his, started to change course to avoid collision. At the time the object appeared to climb, as at the beginning of a climb, and at the same time intensifying in a greenish-white color and leaving a trail of fire and sparks similar to a 5th-of-July rocket in flight. After approximately 8 seconds of this climb, the object disintegrated into a ball of fire.

Discussion

The ATIC contract astronomer states that the object observed was a meteor. The fact that the object appeared to climb was probably caused by the motion of the aircraft as it turned to avoid collision.

Conclusion

Was astronomical (meteor).

On the night of 2 June 1953 at approximately 2235 hours, Capt. John J. Graver Jr. was piloting a Convair T-29 type aircraft, no. #170 on a round robin flight from Perrin AFB, Texas to Tucumcari, Alabama. The aircraft was on a heading of approximately 58 degrees magnetic, owing in a northeasterly direction at an altitude of 9,000 feet over the vicinity of Newton, Mississippi, in the vicinity of Newton, Mississippi, when the pilot sighted an unidentified flying object.

The object appeared on the left side of the aircraft and remained on a parallel course with the aircraft for approximately eight (8) seconds, then appeared to be distancing for two (2) seconds, and disappearing at the same time. The object was metallic and appeared to be round. Capt. Graver could not estimate the distance of the object from the aircraft.

Capt. Graver had heard the pilot of another aircraft report the object to a ground station radio and later confirmed this report that he also had seen the object and he thought, being as the other pilot had reported the object, there was no need for him to report it here at Ellington upon landing.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

On the night of 2 June 1953, at approximately 2230 hours, 1st Lieutenant William W. Heyhill, Jr. was piloting a Convair T-29 type aircraft, 1st Ign. 1951, on a round robin flight from Ellington Air Force Base, Texas to Keesler Air Force Base, Alabama to Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. The aircraft was on a course approximately 025 degrees, northeasterly, moving in a northeasterly direction at an altitude of 9,000 feet. The aircraft was seven and one half (7½) miles south of Meridian, Mississippi, when a whitish green light attracted the pilot's attention.

The light had the appearance of an aircraft navigational light and was estimated to be from five (5) to seven (7) miles from the aircraft. The object was visible on continued watch (2) for fifteen (15) seconds. The pilot thought the light was an aircraft navigational light and that it seemed to be a peculiar green with the aircraft seeming to brighten and the pilot, thinking it an aircraft turning in to him, turned to change course. At this time the object appeared to close as at the beginning of a Chandelle and at the same time light up with such intensity similar to a fourth of July rocket in flight. After approximately two (2) seconds of this close the object disintegrated into a ball of fire and sparks.

This object was reported to Meridian CAA Radio Station by the pilot of the aircraft and Meridian Radio Station told the pilot that the object had been sighted by Newlands AFB tower. Assuming this object to be a meteor, the pilot gave no further report.

On the night of 2 June 1953 at approximately 2245 hours, 1st Lt. R. L. Cornett was in Nichols F-84 type aircraft, no. 7033, on a road robin flight from Ellington AFB, Texas to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The aircraft was on a heading of approximately 26 degrees magnetic, moving in a northeasterly direction when what appeared to be a bright light attracted his attention.

The light was visible for approximately five (5) seconds, during which time it was giving off fire and sparks such as a meteor would until it ceased to burn itself out. At the first sighting of the object, it was very high and to the left of the aircraft, cording down on a forty-five (45) degree angle from the position of the aircraft.

Lt. Cornett believes that from the characteristics that he observed, this object was a meteor.

Description
On the night of 2 June 1953 at approximately 2251 hours a Convair T-29 type aircraft No. 1931 was on a round-robin flight from Ellington AF Base to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The aircraft was on a course approximately 58 degrees magnetic moving in a northeast direction at altitude of 9000 feet. The aircraft was 12 miles southwest of Newton, Mississippi, when a whitish-green light attracted the pilot's attention. The light had the appearance of an aircraft navigational light and was estimated to be from 5 to 7 miles from the aircraft. The object was visible as an estimated 1/2 to 1/3 second. The pilot thought the light was an aircraft's navigational light and that it seemed to be on a parallel course with the aircraft. The light seemed to brighten and the pilot, thinking it was an aircraft turning into his head, started to change course to avoid collision. At the time the object appeared to climb, as at the beginning of a climb, and at the same time the light was intensifying in a greenish-white color and leaving a trail of fire and sparks similar to a trail-off rocket in flight. After approximately 2 seconds of this climb, the object disintegrated into a ball of fire.

Discussion
The ATIC contract astronomer states that the object observed was a meteor. The fact that the object appeared to climb was probably caused by the motion of the aircraft as it turned to avoid collision.

Conclusion
Was astronomical (meteor).

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

In compliance with AF Ltr 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) Numerous unidentified lights that emitted a powerful yellowish glow were observed flying and maneuvering over San Antonio, Texas. Shape not discernible and lights appeared to observer to be the approximate size of an average bicycle wheel. Observer states that only three lights were visible to him at any one time but felt that there could have been as many as six due to the fact that these three appeared and disappeared numerous times in the general area. Lights first observed near and circled in no particular formation. However, towards the end of the sighting, two lights apparently flew together in aerodynamic headings north and disappeared by gradually fading out of sight. No aerodynamic features, trail or exhaust, nor propulsion system noted. Speed unestimated but observer stated that he timed one light and that it took ten seconds for it to travel from a position ninety degrees angle to a position of forty five degrees angle. Altitude unestimated. No sound was heard and maneuvered consisted of intermittent zig zag movement and a circular path by one of the lights.

(2) Lights were observed 2220 hours, CST, 2 June 1953, and were observed until 0020 hours, CST, 3 June 1953.

(3) A visual ground observation without optical or electronic equipment was made.

(4) Observer was at his residence, 211 McMurry Rd, San Houston Village, San Antonio, Texas at the time of the sighting. Lights were first observed in the southeast sky flying a circular course.

(5) Lights were observed by 1st Lt and Mrs. [REDACTED] and their next door neighbor, Captain [REDACTED].

(6) Fair weather prevailed at the time of the sightings. Visibility was fifteen miles and the wind was ten thousand feet at southeast at eight knots per hour.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, is known to have existed at the time which might have accounted for the sightings.

(8) No physical evidence of the sightings.

(9) Observer contacted Captain H. B. Cleveland, the Officer of the Day, at Randolph AF Base, Texas, who confirmed the sighting and stated that the observer definitely were not aircraft of the conventional type.

(10) Location of any air traffic in the general area at the time of the sighting unknown.

Comments of Preparing Officer

1. Query of Maxwell Flight Service Center provided additional information.

a. The date-time groups 030452 and 030517 indicate Greenwich Mean Time.

b. Aircraft transmitted the information to Meridian, Mississippi Interstate
Airways Communications Station (Cal), which transmitted the message to Maxwell Flight
Service Center via Greenville (Miss) Circuit and teletype. 030517z is the time
that Meridian transmitted the message.

c. Maxwell Flight Service Center relayed the message exactly as received,
and is unable to confirm the pilot of AF5170 to clarify identifying information.

2. A deficiency is noted. The wording of the last sentence indicates that the sighting near Jackson, Mississippi may have been by an aircraft other than AF5170
("Home station also Ellington AFB, Texas").
