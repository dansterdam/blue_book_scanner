AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PLACE REPORTED: Newton, Mississippi to Lake Charles, Louisiana
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 5 June 1953
SUMMARY: Reports the unidentified light's attempts to be a special flying object are by Capt. John V. Grange Jr., pilot of a T-33 type aircraft. The light was observed for about 2.5 hours and was paced by the aircraft for about 30 minutes. The light descended to approximately 2,000 feet, hovered for a short time, then ascended rapidly up out of sight.
CONCLUSIONS: The object was probably a special project aircraft or meteorological device connected with activities at the Barksdale AFB, and the pilot's sighting of it apparently caused no immediate concern to the Air Force.

2 June 1953

Description
On the night of 2 June 1953 at approximately 2231 hours a T-33 type aircraft from Keesler AFB, Mississippi, was over the Tallulah, Louisiana, area returning to Keesler AFB from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The aircraft was at an altitude of approximately 23,000 feet when a whitish-green light attracted the pilot's attention. The light passed the aircraft from the starboard to port side at a distance of approximately 1/2 to 1 mile from the aircraft. The object was seen to be free of any visible trail or exhaust as it passed the aircraft. Though the object was seen to be moving at a high rate of speed in a straight course with the aircraft, the pilot did not notice any sound from the object. The light appeared to brighten and the pilot, thinking it was a rocket, called for an observer to confirm his observation. As the light drew closer, it appeared to the pilot to be a 1 to 1 1/2 feet in diameter and cylindrical in shape. Just before this object disappeared, it appeared to fire a small 1 to 1 1/2 inch object which was observed to the rear of the main object at an approximate speed of 1,000 miles per hour for approximately 2 to 3 seconds before the object distinguished into a ball of fire.

Discussion
The ATIC contract astronomer states that the object observed was a meteors. The fact that the object appeared to climb was probably caused by the motion of the aircraft as it turned to avoid collision.

Conclusion
Was astronomical (meteor).

SUBJECT: Object Sighting, Newton, MS and Lake Charles, LA, 23 May 1953

On 23 May 1953 at approximately 2325 hours, Mr. John J. Coyne, Consultant of 3200 Snider, Dallas, Texas, reported to Wing Intelligence Officer that he had sighted an unidentified object while in route to New Orleans from Dallas, Texas. The object was initially observed at approximately 2247 hours CST about 25 miles north of Newton, Mississippi, traveling at an estimated speed of 700 - 800 MPH and at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet. The object maintained a steady parallel course with the aircraft and remained in sight for approximately 40 - 45 minutes, at which time it began gaining altitude and disappeared from view. The object appeared oblong or elliptical in shape, emitting a steady white light which at times appeared to intensify and diminish in brilliance.

The witness was certain the object was not a star, planet, or any known type of aircraft or celestial body. It was not affected by cloud cover encountered during the sighting. The witness reported the incident immediately upon landing at Dallas.

This report has been investigated and the facts related in this report are substantially correct.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
On the night of 2 June 1953, at approximately 2350 hours, Lt. 
Identified a red light near a small jet aircraft or other object while flying a Convair T-29 training aircraft over the Greenville, Mississippi AF Base training area. The pilot made several rapid changes in altitude and direction while attempting to close on the object, but was unable to close within a range of approximately 5,000 feet. The pilot's attention was distracted by another small light which appeared a few minutes later and continued to maneuver in the area. Neither object was positively identified or explained. The pilot and observer were unable to get closer than 5,000 feet to the objects before they disappeared from view.
The pilots had the aircraft navigational lights and were in contact with the aircraft control tower during the incident. The lights observed were unconventional in color, speed and maneuverability as compared to conventional aircraft. No sound was heard from the objects, and they disappeared and reappeared without any apparent means of propulsion observed. The report further states no aeronautical explanation for the sighting could be found.
This object was reported to the Keesler AAF Radio Station by the pilot and observer while in flight. The pilot stated he did not believe the object was a conventional aircraft and could not be identified.

2 June 1953
Description
On the night of 2 June 1953 at approximately 2251 hours a Convair T-29 type aircraft No. 1931 was on a round-robin flight from Ellington Air Base to Shreveport, Louisiana. The aircraft was on a course approximately 180 degrees and at an altitude of 9000 feet. The aircraft was 7½ miles south-southeast of Newton. Mississippi, when the pilot's attention was attracted to an object in the sky. The object was observed for approximately 8 to 9 minutes. The object was estimated to be from 3 to 7 miles from the aircraft. The object thought the light was
visible an navigation light and that it seemed to be on a parallel
course with the aircraft. The light appeared to be white in color,
similar to a fleshlite of a city. The object did not appear close enough
to avoid collision. Another time the object appeared to climb, in an
evasive action. After this climb, the object seemed to be slightly
larger than the navigation light. After approximately 2 seconds
the object disappeared.
Discussion
The AFOC contract astronomer states that the object observed was
a meteor. The fact that the object appeared to climb was probably
caused by the motion of the aircraft as it turned to avoid collision.
Conclusion
Was astronomical (meteor).

AF FORM 112--PART II UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: CG, 8 AAMA 
REPORT NO.:

In compliance with AF Ltr 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) Numerous unidentified lights that emitted a powerful yellowish glow were observed flying and maneuvering over San Antonio, Texas. Their shape was not discernible and they appeared to oscillate up and down for brief periods. It was estimated that there could have been as many as two dozen of these lights at one time, according to the fact that these lights appeared to be milling about and were not flying in any particular formation. Their movements were described as erratic and after a few seconds they disappeared. Two lights apparently flew together in formation heading north and disappeared by gradually fading out of sight. The observation of these lights lasted for approximately ten seconds and it took ten seconds for them to travel from a position ninety degrees above the horizon to the horizon. The entire phenomenon was observed to consist of intermittent zig zag movements in a circular path by one of the lights.

(2) Lights were observed 2220 hours, GST, 2 June 1953, and were observed until 0020 hours, GST, 3 June 1953.

(3) A visual ground observation without optical or electronic equipment was made.

(4) Observer was at his residence, 211 Murray Rd, San Houston Village, San Antonio, Texas. The sighting was first observed in the east to north east direction over San Antonio, Texas.

(5) Lights were observed by 1st Lt and Mrs. and their next door neighbor.

(6) Fair weather prevailed at the time of the sighting. Visibility was fifteen miles and the wind was from the southeast at eight knots per hour.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, is known to have existed which might have accounted for the sighting.

(8) No physical evidence of the sighting.

(9) Observer contacted Captain H. B. Cleveland, the Officer of the Day, at Randolph AF Base, Texas, who confirmed the sighting and stated it was officially classified as unidentified. 

(10) Location of any air traffic in the general area at the time of the sightings unknown.
