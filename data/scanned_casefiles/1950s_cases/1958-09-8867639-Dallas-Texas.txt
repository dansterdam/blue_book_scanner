The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text describes sightings of objects and rocket carriers, and discusses a possible explanation involving F-84 Crusader jet fighters.

RUSSIAN ROCKET CARRIERS AND "SPUTNIK". HE SAID THAT

PAGE FOUR RJWFW 30
THE OEJECTS FOLLOWED ROUGHLY THE SAME COURSE AS THE SPUINIKS
AND THEIR ROCKET CARRIERS. A JET AIRCRAFT VAPOR TRAIL WAS
VISIBLE TO THE OBSERVER AT. THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. FURTHER
AIRCRAFT ITSELF WAS NOT VISIBLE. THIS VAPOR TRAIL WAS ABOUT
FIFTEEN DEGREES LONG. A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THIS PHENOMENON
IS THAT THE OEJECTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN F94-I CRUSADER JET
FIGHTERS CUT OF THE CHANCE-VOUGHT AIRCRAFT PLANT LOCATED NEAR
HERE.
