Here is the text from the document:

RUSSIAN ROCKET CARRIERS AND "SPUTNIK". HE SAID THAT

PAGE FOUR RJWFHW 30

THE OBJECTS FOLLOWED ROUGHLY THE SAME COURSE AS THE SPUTNIKS AND THEIR ROCKET CARRIERS. A JET AIRCRAFT VAPOR TRAIL WAS VISIBLE TO THE OBSERVER AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING PUTTHE AIRCRAFT ITSELF WAS NOT VISIBLE. THIS VAPOR TRAIL WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN DEGREES LONG. A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THIS PHENOMENON IS THAT THE OBJECTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN F8U-1 CRUSADER JET FIGHTERS CUT OF THE CHANCE-VOUGHT AIRCRAFT PLANT LOCATED NEAR HERE.

Navy F8 96 is of x.tech color and if they were close enough to be test almost as large a baseball, the color would be readily notable.
