AT 0515 EST, Capt Govedake (telephone 3914D) called to say that at 2300 EST be and a Major Mancini (Tele 3192) observed an unusual object from WWPD City. Ohio, on 29 May 1952. They were observing the sky through 7x50 binoculars when they saw the object. It was described as a round or elliptical object which was observed near Spica and moved to Delta Corvis, 30Â° of arc, in from 10 to 15 seconds.

One half hour later the same or a similar object was observed to go over 9 to 10 miles in from 10 to 15 seconds. It was viewed through 10 power glasses and appeared to have a green light. They were not able to estimate the height but there were no sounds.

In both cases the light faded out.

Capt Govedake is a physicist with the special projects group at WADC. Major Franklin is with the Institute.
