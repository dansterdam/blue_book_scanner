At 0815 EST, Capt Govendik (telephone 35240) called to say that at 2300 EST he and a Major Franklin (Ext. 2112) observed an unusual object from Tipp City, Ohio, on 29 May 1952. They were observing the sky through a 6 inch telescope when Major Franklin observed this object moving. Both observed it and 18 and 1/2 appeared to be drifted. It was first observed near Spica and moved to Delta Corvis, 30Â° of arc, in from 10 to 15 seconds.

One half hour later the same or a similar object was observed to go from 1 to 3 between the same two stars. It was seen for from 10-15 seconds. It was viewed through 10 power Agena and appeared to have a green light on right and red on left. They were not blinking, however, and there were no sounds.

In both cases the light faded out.

Capt Govendik is a physicist with the special projects group at WADC.
Major Franklin is with the Institute.
