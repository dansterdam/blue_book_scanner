SWORN STATEMENT

I, Warren J Elgenheim, 2nd Lt., USAF, AO 13613172, 34th Air Division (Tac), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On Friday evening 17 October 1952, at approximately 2115 MST, I observed a strange object in the sky. While sitting in the Hunkupal area, I watched a local football game. I happened to look to the north and saw what appeared to be a very large meteor, the path of fall was almost vertical and toward magnetic north. The object gave off a bright blue-green color, and emitted a sudden flash when it disappeared from view.

It is extremely difficult to describe the size of the object because, at most, it was only in sight for two (2) seconds. It was, however, larger than the average falling stars. The object appeared to burn itself out rather than fall from flight. This was borne out by the unusual flash at the end of the fall. Distance and speed were other factors of which it would be impossible to give an accurate estimate due to lack of comparable size.

SWORN STATEMENT

I, Charles R Coble, Major, USAF, AO 904973, 4910th Air Base Group, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

At approximately W10 hours, on the night of 17 October 1952, while traveling into Taos, New Mexico, I observed from the car window, high in the sky, a large blue object. This object was a volley tall. This object was traveling from a north to a northeast direction at about a 45 degree angle, and was bright blue in colors. I would estimate its speed at approximately 2,500 mile per hour, and was approximately 10,000 feet above the ground.

I would say that I observed the object for about 2 or 3 seconds, and it then disappeared.

On Friday evening 17 October 1952, at approximately 2110 hours EST, I observed a strange object in the sky. While watching a football game at Municipal Stadium, I noticed what appeared to be a very large meteor east of Albuquerque traveling north. The object was a bright blue-green, and falling very rapidly. It was only in view for about one (1) second, and it was not possible to estimate any speed. The object appeared to burn itself out rather than fall from sight.

I, William J. Arrowood, 2d Lieutenant, USAF, AO 1850521, 4910th Air Base Group, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

At about 2115 hours, 17 October 1952, I saw an object about the size of a football across through the sky in a southwest to northeast direction.

I was sitting in the public schools stadium in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico at the time. I estimate the object to be traveling at a speed of over 2000 miles per hour and at an altitude of 30,000 feet. It seemed to me that this object was a meteorite and it was bright blue in color.

I would say that I observed the object for about 3 seconds, and it then disappeared.
