AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency)                REPORT NO.         TF-24-53
        Dir/Int, NEAC                                    PAGE   2   OF   2   PAGES

1. An unidentified aerial object was visually observed from the ground by a
number of military personnel northwest of Pepperrell Air Force Base, Newfoundland,
21 June 1953, at 1545Z.

2. The object, described as a thin, silver-tan object, but not visible
driver, was at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. The object was semi-stationary
and was not seen to carry out any maneuvers. Object was not seen with any trail or sound.

3. The object was still visible at 1630Z, or a total period of observation
of 45 minutes. The object was one of a first reported by Major
____________(Senior Pilot), commander of 610th Air Base Sqdn., (address withheld).

4. No CGI or GCA contact was made with the object. Weather sequence was:
3000 broken, 15 miles visibility, surface winds NW, 22K plus to 34K, winds aloft
30,000 feet 330 degrees at 120°.

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officer:

1. It was first believed that the object was a weather balloon. Checks
were made with various weather stations in Newfoundland, and it was learned
that Ernest Harmon AFB released a balloon 45 minutes prior to the time of
sighting. Which over Harmon were: 29,000 feet, 320 degrees at 125K. Pepperrell
AFB is approximately 230 miles ESE of Ernest Harmon AFB close extremely high
winds were prevailing in the general direction the balloon was reported. However,
the balloon was tracked for a period of 34 minutes at Harmon. Contact was lost
with the balloon when it was 50 miles distant at 27,300 feet. Since the
balloon was of the radiosonde type, a positive burst could not be determined,
altitude was only 29,000 feet. However, the balloon, having consumed 34 minutes and gone only 50 miles, would have to travel the remaining 200 miles in 11 minutes, thus eliminating the possibility that the Harmon balloon accounted for the sighting.

2. A balloon was also released from McAndrew AFB, approximately 90 miles
southwest of Pepperrell AFB. This balloon was released the night before the
sighting, on 20 June 1953, and first tracking at 0215, 320 degrees at 125K. But
this balloon also could not account for the sighting.

3. It is considered very unlikely that the object was an aircraft because
of the low duration of the sighting, and the covering area of the object. The
possibility of celestial or meteorological conditions causing the sighting does
exist.

4. The Director of Intelligence, NEAC evaluates this incident as an uniden-
tified aerial object.

Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson,

Now that Jennie has her preliminary clearance, she can help me handle the reports and can type the letters to you and to your successor. This will improve the quality of the typing ( \) I am sure. I cannot guarantee spelling. (neither can I.)

With respect to the two wires you sent us on June 23, there is only one thing to say: The 21 June Pepperrell AFB case must be tossed out because of grossly insufficient data. Do you think there is a glimmer of anything interesting there which would justify sending a Form A? It seems to me that reports of this kind just clutter up the wires without accomplishing anything.

The San Antonio 16 June is clearly a meteorological phenomenon and one that would warm the heart of Menzel. This was undoubtedly as suggested, namely the light of the setting sun on a high cloud.

Referring to the follow-up statement on the 10 June Detroit case, both Jennie and I still think this was a landing light and agree it could not have been a meteor.

Business is a little slow. Jen is going ahead with requesting cooperation from the air control tower operators. Her usefulness has increased in view of her temporary clearance and I hope that her full clearance will not be too long in coming.

I hope we can see you soon and wish you a bon voyage into law School.

Sincerely,
Allen Hynek

Jah/jg
