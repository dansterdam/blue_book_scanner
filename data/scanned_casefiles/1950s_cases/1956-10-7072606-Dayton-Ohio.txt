The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the letter "A" placed on it, and an object above the horizon. The second sketch contains two larger sketches. The one on the left shows a road with buildings and trees on either side, and a person walking on the road. The one on the right shows a silhouette of a mountain or hill against the sky.
