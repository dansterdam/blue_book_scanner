The following is an extract of a series of UFO sightings observed over various sections of Europe during the period 11 July-20 Sep 54. Reference ATIC 201047, dated 29 Oct 54.

Austria - 19 Aug 54
Small, gleaming disc-like object, about twice as large as Venus. Observed for 2 minutes. ATIC Eval: Possible Balloon.

Finland - 14 Sep 54
Circular flying object over Helsinki at night. Flying at 300 meters (alt), it gave off an intense light and left trail of reddish smoke. Visible for 7 sec. ATIC Eval: Possible meteor.

France - 30 Aug 54 - Paris
A Paris resident observed a luminous circular object flying over the city. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Some Department - 7 Sep 54
A 27 year old mason and his assistant observed a "flying saucer" at 0715 hrs, 7 Sep 54. The object was grey and was observed hovering over a field about 200 meters from the observers. The object oscillated slowly and seemed to have a closed door at its side. When the men had run about 50 meters toward it, the object began to fly away. Smoke was then visible from a sort of exhaust pipe on the underside. After an oblique flight of about 15 meters, the object was vertically and diagonally disappeared. No trace of the object was found by police. The object was about 10 meters in diameter and 3 meters in height, did not glow and departed noiselessly, trailing smoke. Visible for about 3 minutes. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN

Alsace Department - 7 Sep 54
A luminous red or orange disc observed by three persons. The disk stopped suddenly 300-400 meters from the ground. It seemed to have on its upper side a small luminous tail forming an integral part of the object. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data.

Italy - 14 Sep 54
Two inhabitants of Pitigliano report sighting of a round, white object making a strange, loud noise. The object came to a stand still, and then disappeared at high speed. ATIC Eval: UNKNOWN - Insufficient data

Rome - 17 Sep 54
On the afternoon of 17 Sep 54, the control tower at the Ciampino Air Base observed a mysterious object shaped like a nail or cigar flying slowly at an altitude of 1,200 meters. The object, leaving a trail of luminous smoke, was visible for 40 minutes. ATIC Eval: Probable high Altitude a/c.

Netherlands - 4 Aug 54

Ten firemen observed two "flying saucers" over the Hague on the night of 4 August between 2300 and 2800 hours. They moved at incredible speed, at times remaining motionless for as long as 30 seconds. They were flat ovals with a whitish gray light. ATIC Eval: Possible searchlight beams.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in UFO sightings throughout Europe. ATIC attributes the majority of these sightings to two basic reasons:

1. The European press has been quick to publish, in detail, UFO sightings which has resulted in intensifying a great number of personal publicity.

2. Mr. D. Keyhoe's book was recently translated into various foreign languages and went on sale at newsstands throughout Europe during the summer of 1954.

Note 17 Aug 54
To: ATIC Received two "flying saucers" over the Hague on the
15th of August between 2300 and 2400 hours. They were at interdict-
ed range. At that time a civilian at Rijswijk saw two objects. They were
flat, oval with a whitish gray light. ATIC eval: Possible searchlight
beam.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked
increase in UFO sightings throughout Europe. ATIC attributed the majority
of these sightings to two basic reasons:

1. The European press has been quick to publish, in detail, UFO
sightings which has resulted in influencing a great number of persons far
beyond actual reality.

2. Mr. D. Keyhoe's book was recently translated into various foreign
languages and went on sale at newsstands throughout Europe during the summer
