The form includes information such as the location, the number of objects observed, the length of the observation, the type of observation, and whether there were any photos or physical evidence. The conclusion states that the data was insufficient.

Netherlands - 8 Aug 54

Two pilots observed two "flying saucers" over the Dutch-German border. They moved at incredible speed, at times remaining motionless for as long as 10 seconds. They were red in color with a whitish trail.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in the sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) over Western Europe. ATIC attributes the majority of these sightings to balloon research trials by Soviet elements in Eastern Europe.

Dr. D. Keyhoe's book was recently translated into various foreign languages and went on sale in Denmark. Europe during the summer of 1954.

UNCLASSIFIED

On 14 September 1954, two "flying saucers" were observed over the base of the US Air Force at Orly, France, between 2100 and 2400 hours. They were observed to make sudden turns and stops displaying a whitish glow and traveling at an estimated speed of 500-600 mph. At one point, one of the objects was observed to make a vertical climb of 1,000 feet per second.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in the number of reported sightings of these objects over France. The interest in this phenomenon in France has been quick to publish, in detail, the various sightings as they occur, and a great number of reports have reached us from personal publicity.

As a result, "Flying Saucers", whose book is recently translated into various foreign languages, are now on sale at newstands throughout Europe during the summer of 1954.
