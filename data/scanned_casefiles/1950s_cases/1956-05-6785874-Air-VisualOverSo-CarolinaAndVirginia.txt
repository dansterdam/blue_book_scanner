Statement of 1/Lt Robert D. Anderson

STATEMENT

I was flying from Eglin AFB, direct to Bolling AFB and at 30,000 ft and object was called out by 1st Pogue (he had a flight of 5 P-47's). Within 10 minutes all of us picked out the object. (It was sighted about 10 nautical miles SW of Winston Salem) (Approximately 9:10 CDST). It had no apparent movement and we saw it until we let-down at Washington.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a young man of average build. He was quiet and very serious. He seemed to be of above average intelligence. He took a great deal of time to answer the questions put to him by the investigator and he was explicit in his answers. The information received from the SOURCE is considered reliable in the opinion of the investigator.

III. SOURCE's Description of the Object:

1. SOURCE was piloting and F-84F at an altitude of 30,000 ft, flying over open country, clear sky, wind direction: SSW 30-50 kts, temperature: cold. Object observed from sunglasses and windshield of aircraft for a period of 30 minutes.

2. Object appeared to be a solid and appeared on SOURCE's right. Object was brighter than the background of sky and similar in brilliance to a sunlight. SOURCE was looking in a northwest direction when object appeared and when SOURCE last observed object.

3. Bearings from true North when first observed 50 deg and 30 deg from horizon. Object bearing same when last observed.

4. This was the first time SOURCE had ever observed an object such as this and estimated the size to be that of a pin head held at arms length. Very sharply outlined. Ideal size or distance of object could not be determined. SOURCE states that object appeared to be metallic or highly reflective substance spherical in shape. Comparable to a large balloon with metallic finish.

5. SOURCE states that he thinks the object was a heavenly body reflected in position for a period of time and would have held to be at a great distance and altitude to maintain its relative stable position.

Statement by Lt William R Pogue

STATEMENT

During a cross-country flight from Eglin AFB to Bolling AFB, I sighted an object at about 210 o'clock position. We had been airborne approximately 40 minutes and were cruising at 35,000 ft, in a B-50. After first sighting the object, I made sure it was not a refractive glint from the canopy and then called it out to leader.

I had some difficulty in properly describing its position so the leader could see but in a few minutes the rest of the flight was able to spot it also. It was relatively very small, held a constant position, was circular or spherical and fully brilliant over its surface. Although the suns rays could not have fully covered the surface of the object which we were observing. This led me to believe it was (1) At extreme distance so that any illuminated source as small as it was would appear round and (2) A transparent object i.e. Balloon, which would appear fully lighted.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
None

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was caused by the planet Venus for the following reasons:

    a. At the time of the sighting the planet Venus, which was visible during daylight hours in May 1956, was at approximately the same position as the object.

    b. The object was described by all observers as being like a bright star. One observer stated that he felt the sighting was caused by a "heavenly body reflecting light".

    c. Although the observers' aircraft traveled many miles during the sighting the object remained stationary, indicating that the object was at a great distance from the observers.

    d. Winds aloft at the time of the sighting coupled with the distance traveled by the observers aircraft would preclude the possibility of a balloon.

    e. In a telephone conversation with this headquarters Major J. Broughton, Flight Leader of the Thunderbirds and an observer of the object in question, stated that from past experience this sighting was not caused by a balloon but could have been caused by a bright star or planet.

II. Reliability: SOURCE was a young man with a nonchalant manner. He seemed to be in a hurry to get the interview over and this may be attributed to the fact he had already filed one report. However, he seemed to be a person of above average intelligence. He gave thought to each question before answering and was sure of his answers.

III. SOURCE'S Description of Object:

1. SOURCE was piloting an F-84F type aircraft from Eglin AFB, Fl., enroute to Bolling AFB, Washington, DC. SOURCE'S attention was directed to object by other members of flight and observed the object for approximately thirty (30) minutes.

2. It was a bright day and the light was very brilliant and the sun was located to the pilot's right. SOURCE was flying over open country in a northeast direction. SOURCE was looking in a northeast direction when he first saw an and last saw the object.

3. SOURCE could hear no sound from the object and the color was bright and silvery. Edges of the object looked like a bright star. SOURCE did not observe the object make any apparent motion.

4. SOURCE could not estimate the real size of the object but compared it to a star as a common object. Estimated the size to be that of a pen a half arm's length.

5. This was the first time SOURCE had ever seen an object such as this. SOURCE could not determine the speed or distance of the object. SOURCE observed object through sunglasses and the windshield of the aircraft.

6. SOURCE was flying at 30,000 ft when object was first sighted. Object disappeared when SOURCE descended thru cloud cover for landing at Bolling AFB.

7. SOURCE stated that the object could possibly have been a star, very luminous and appeared as a star; or it was caused by phenomena of atmosphere which enabled him to see object clearly or a star out of its orbit.

Statement of Capt Billy Joe Ellis

S T A T E M E N T

I was in a flight of five (5) F-84's enroute to Bolling AFB from Eglin AFB. Flight was conducted VFR at 30,000 to about 30 nautical miles SSW of Winston Salem when the object was first sighted. I did not see it until past Winston Salem because I was on a different radio channel making a position report. I saw this object, which was very bright, and silvery and lost sight of it during the descent to Bolling AFB. Reported sighting to Base Operations Officer, Major George Taylor at Bolling AFB.
