(1) The observer is that of a young man of 29, with apparently average intelligence and observation for a man of that age. His story checks out and he appears sincere. He stated that he and other employees working at the Windmill Inn observed the object as described, and that it seems to hover or remain stationary at various altitudes and then take off at a high rate of speed.  

(2) The observer stated to this officer that he does not believe the object was a true aircraft. He stated that it was much larger and quite different in appearance from any known aircraft. The object was also relatively silent compared to any conventional aircraft.

(3) The observer stated that he does not drink, and that that day had been very normal for him. There was no indication of any reason to doubt the truthfulness of his statement.

(4) The object that caused the sighting was due to some unknown phenomenon which could not be explained or identified as a known object.

STATEMENT

While returning from Fairfax, Oklahoma, traveling on Highway 60, at about 20 minutes past 6:30, approximately one half mile west of the state line, I observed some orange colored objects on the horizon directly ahead. Within a few seconds the objects were greatly reduced in number, the shape of a disc, and traveling at a terrific rate of speed. I turned to my friend and asked him to look at the objects, but by this time they were too far away to see them out of the rear window, but with no success. We were driving approximately 30 MPH, and although I slowed down, I did not stop. A day later we were discussing the objects, and we commenced on the fact that we had heard no noise, and moticed no motion.

"From the Office 0.1' the
Lieutenant Colonel, A.C.
November 3, 1952

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object.
To: Commanding Officer,
Watson Laboratories, Red Bank,
New Jersey.

Dear Sir:

The following report of an unidentified flying object is submitted for your information.

On November 2, 1952 at approximately 12:50 A.M. we were north bound about 9 miles south of Fairfax, Oklahoma with myself driving. I first noticed the objects far west on the northern horizon directly over a small town known as Fairfax's corner. There were four bright orange colored lights which appeared to be in a fixed formation and were traveling at a high rate of speed. They appeared at first to be in a relatively straight line, but as they approached my position they seemed to be in more of a V-shaped formation. Their speed was tremendous and I would estimate that they covered the distance from the northern horizon to the eastern horizon in less than a minute. There was no sound whatsoever. The lights remained a constant brilliant orange color throughout the sighting. As the objects passed overhead I lost sight of them in the eastern sky.

I am writing this letter in the hope that perhaps you may have some explanation for these objects. I will be glad to furnish any additional information that may be required.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]"

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image:

According to the image, the text reads:

"A report was made by a Sgt. regarding our directive advice as to what the object now, whatever it may have been. That the USAF show of "hydrogen balloons" will not fit in so as to exactly explain the object in question. If you could please give any explanation as to why it would be very much appreciated as I am apparently unable as to why that this object was seen.

Yours very truly, [Redacted]"
