10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One data wing object, the size of a dime held at arms length, dark in color. Six jets in middle seemed to be bigger and the exhaust was a greenish color. Object was 25 degrees above horizon at sighting, descending rapidly, and then faded after three seconds of observation.

11. COMMENTS
The description of the object, the fact that it had a tail (or trail), the duration of the sighting, the course of the object, and the color indicate that this sighting was in all probability generated by a meteor.
