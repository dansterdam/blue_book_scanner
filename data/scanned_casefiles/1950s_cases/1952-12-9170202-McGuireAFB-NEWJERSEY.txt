6. I don't believe the blue-white light came from the same source as the blips. As Major Sheffield's report says, "Visual sightings are indicative and of little confirmatory value." I agree. Perhaps in the excitement of following the unusual targets on the scope, personnel read something unusual into an incident which they normally would have recognized, or have dismissed as of no consequence.

CASE # 19
6 December 1952                                     Off Coast of Louisiana

On the return leg from Florida to Galveston, Texas, training mission, natural gas burning from oil refineries on the Louisiana coast were noted. To check student navigator's celestial, I requested the student radar to turn on the scope, which had been off for 30 miles W of Tampa, and see if he could pick up the coast there on the 100 mile range. After the set was on for a sufficient time to warm up, I was given permission to turn up the brilliance on the sun. scope, and both student radar and I checked for coastline returns and found none. At this time the set had not be calibrated. My attention then was attracted from the scope for a period of time.

At 0525 CST Radar called for my attention to the scope and I first noted small, bright blips returns, approximately 1, with no specific grouping such a radar beacon transmits. Azimuth stabilization was on. As the sweep rotated one revolution, the blips moved SE across the scopeware more than one range marker. Radar stated at that time he had 50-mile range on; indicating a movement of 12-14 miles. With each successive revolution, the blips continued SE to a point 15-20 miles from the ship at a bearing of 70 deg and then out of the scope. At 150 deg Radar gave the Instructor Flight Engineer the time and distance which was computed as over 5000 mph. These groupings of blips occurred for about 5 minutes and speeds were recomputed. During this period, student Navigator and Instructor radio viewed the sun. scope and confirmed my observations. At this time I called for Radar to calibrate his set to eliminate any possibility of malfunction. He did this speedily and when he scanned the scope once more the blips reappeared moving SE across the scope. I called off two separate blips track and position in relation to the a/c by the clock system over interphone of the ship and as they passed at 3 o'clock, the Instructor Engineer visibly saw a blue-bright white flame go from front

to rear under our wing. Contact was broken off at 0535 after a group of the blips
merged into a 3 inch curved arc about 30 miles from our a/c at 320 deg and proceeded
across the scope and off it at a computed speed of over 9000 mph. At all times during
the contact the a/c was level and stable, the weather was clear, not a cloud in the
sky and visibility was excellent. There was a full moon giving excellent water
reflection. The a/c was flying long range cruise at the time. Radar checked the
blips at all scan till angles full up and down and didn't lose the blips until the
scanning antenna was pointed down. One gun group of blips after the scope was calibrated were noted, after moving from 330 deg to 150 deg across the scope, to arc about
and swing in behind us at approximately 30 miles and maintain speed and distance for
approximately 10 seconds and then disappear.

ATIC Comment:
All possibilities were checked for known aerial phenomena with negative results.

1. Report did not reach Intelligence Agencies until 9 December 1952. At this time Lt. R. Reed of Group Intelligence interrogated the crew members who made the sighting.

2. Interrogation revealed the objects to be arc shaped and about 1/2 inch in length on radar scope and visually as blue-white flashes of light with no discernible shape.

3. No aerodynamic features were noted in the visual sightings. Visual sightings were of split-second duration and only the light was observed. During these visual sightings the light appeared to be of a steady brilliance without any flaring upon disappearance. Speed of object was computed by flight engineer at 520 PH on heading of 120°. Object was at approx. an altitude of 18,000 feet on a heading of 120°. No changes in heading, speed or altitude were noted. Visual sighting made from right west blister. Under sightings were made over a period of 10 minutes. A total of 250 were sighted during this time. Sightings were made on both the main and aux. scopes by two. Navigational coordinates appeared to move 5 miles with each sweep rotation of scope. Each rotation is of 2 1/2 seconds duration.

4. Sighting was at 2325 CST, 6 December 1952.

5. Observation made by radar on both main and aux. scopes and visually from right waist blister of B-29 ending at 200 ft. at approximately altitude of 20,000 ft. A/C was at coordinates 23°10'N - 92°06'W on a true heading 315°.

6. A/C personnel who reported sightings have several hundred hours flying time at their various positions. All are positive in their sightings and rule out any possible radar malfunction as cause of sightings.

7. Weather was CAVU. No winds. Temperature 10°C. It is not known whether there was any activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which would account for the sighting.

8. There is no physical evidence of sightings.

9. No attempt was made to retrace A/C track or otherwise intercept object.

10. No other aircraft were observed in area at time of sighting.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

11. Radar sightings were definite and of such duration as to preclude any error on part of observer. Source are certain that sightings are not due to radar malfunction. Visual sightings are indicative and of little confirmatory value.

I, M/Sgt Purcell, B. R. AF 12010847, do certify that:

At approximately 11:25 O.C.T. an announcement was made over the interphone, to the effect that unusual objects were appearing on the radar scope.

At the time of this announcement I was relieving the student aircraft performance technician at Fontana technician.

The radar operator clocked the objects (about four or five were clocked) and called the time to me, and I computed the air speed of the objects to average 5240 statute miles per hour.

Twice during the period—11:25 O.C.T. and 11:37 O.C.T., the radar operator reported the objects to be passing at "Three o'clock". Upon looking out the window, I saw a blue-white streak travel front to rear and disappear under the wings.

I, S/Sgt Shogren, Harry D. AF 39215213, do certify that:

My observations came about as a result of the instructor Navigator. No evidence came about as a result of some unidentifiable objects that were moving at certain speeds across the radar scope. I noticed over his shoulder and he indicated about five objects that he considered to be something other than normal.

At this time I observed one small, almost round, object approaching the center of the scope from an angle estimated at about 10 o'clock. After another sweep of the scope, it appeared much closer to the center of the scope and approaching at 9 o'clock. I thought this rapid motion, on this observation, was probably the result of an unusual aircraft movement. This, however, was not so as I observed no new unidentified aircraft altitude and our altitude was constant. Therefore, there was no turbulence at any time during this period.

My second observation about ten minutes later was of three objects along long and curved. They were moving in an clockwise direction and were about halfway between center and edge of the scope. Flight conditions stable.

I, 1/Lt. Kerns, Norman AO 1365604, do certify that:

On 6 December 1952, while flying over the Gulf of Mexico towards Galveston, Texas, the flight engineer finished transferring fuel and I then turned on my radar.

I noticed an unidentified object approaching our aircraft at a terrific rate of speed. I timed it as 6 to 8 seconds. I could with my stopwatch see a known distance and the instructor flight engineer computed the speed as 5240 MPH.

I altered the course to look for the object, which was approximately 20 miles of light were noticed. The closest the objects came was approximately 20 miles.

I saw about twenty objects in all, somewhat similar in shape and three are shown as one scope at one time. I reexamined the set and there was no change.

The object was small and possibly round, with the exception of one very large return shaped as follows:

I also noticed a large return come up to within 40 miles of our tailfrom behind, and then disappear.

To the best of my knowledge, I believe that this object was real and moved at an extremely high speed and was not a set malfunction or optical illusion.

PAGE 1 OF 1

I, Neumann, William W., AO 20646632, do certify that:

On the return leg from Florida to Galveston, Texas, Training mission #6, after alerting to a track of 320° from a point 35 of 76°/6,2705-3300, natural gas burnings from oil refineries on the Louisiana coast were noted. To check the scopes, which had been off from 30 miles west of Tampa, and see if he could pick up the coast line, the 100 mile range was used. After the set was on for a sufficient time to warm up, I was given permission to turn up the brilliance on the area.

Radar called for my attention to the scope and I first noted small bright blips, apparently spontaneously, with no specific ground clues. As the radar transmits, appeared on the scope at 3200° Azimuth Stabilization was on. As the set was rotated one revolution, the blips moved more than one range marker. Radar stated at that time he had 50 mile range only indicating a movement of 15-20 miles with such successive revolutions. The blips continued to a point 15-20 miles from the ship at a bearing of 70° and then out of the scope. At 150° Radar gave the Instructor Flight Engineer the time and distance which was computed as over 5000 yds. These groups of blips occurred for about 5 minutes and speeds were recognized. During this period, student navigator and I maintained radio contact. Observation at this time I called for Radar to calibrate his set to eliminate any possibility of malfunction. No old blips were seen in the scanning. The scope once more showed the blips reappearing moving 35 across the scope. I called off two separate blips and noted an azimuth track on the close system over interphone of the ship and as they passed at 30°clock, the Instructor Engineer verified same.

Contact was broken off at 0535 after a group of the blips merged into a 2 inch diameter and moved across the scope and off its computed speed of over 5000 MPH. At all times during the contact the a/c was level and stable. The weather was clear, not a cloud in the sky and visibility was excellent. There was a full moon driving excellent water conditions.

Signed statement by a collateral source at 1st Lt. contact was 276/24 using F3 315, G3 186 and 204 TAS. The aircraft was flying full up and down and didn't lose the blips until the scanning antenna was pointed down. One group of blips after the scope was calibrated were noted.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency) 2nd Fighter-Interceptor Wing McGuire AFB, Frenchtown, NJ    REPORT NO. TR-2-53    PAGE 2 OF 5 PAGES

1. Robert P. Blonde, 1st Lt., AO 1 299 347, of the 2nd Ftr-Intcp Sq, McGuire AFB, Frenchtown, New Jersey, on 6 December 1952 while on a training flight in a F-84 at approximately 1500 hours. The pilot observed that appeared to be an object or light (round) of varying intensity. The colors of the light varied in intensity from white, red and amber. During these changes the light seemed to expand with flashing edges. No pattern in these conditions were noted. The distance was difficult to determine, but if the light were that of an aircraft using normal navigation lights the initial observation could have been calculated at approximately ten miles. No physical form was determined at any time during the chase. There were no exhaust, no sound or exhaust observed at any time.

All observing was done visually and when radar contact was attempted they received a negative result.

The pilot was at approximately 19,000 feet and 10 miles east of Newark NJ. Taking after the light at a heading of 260 degrees for approximately 70 miles and climbing to 22,000 feet he noted that at initial sighting, 70 degrees 20 minutes west and 50 degrees zero minutes north, at 10,000 feet, the object or light appeared to be level with him and that after the climb the object appeared to be higher than he upon reaching 24,250 feet. At one time the pilot thought that he was overtaking object or light at about 150 knots but is not sure of it.

The weather during the run was a few scattered clouds at 5,000 feet and visibility restricted.

There were no activities meteorological or otherwise that could have accounted for the sighting and there was no physical evidence to substantiate same.

In as much was made to overtake this object or light, but results were not active even though pilot was flying the F-84 on such for a time. No other traffic was observed during this period of chase and the pilot returned to the base after notifying the controller (tower controller).

PAGE    5    OF    5    PAGES

The pilot is a flight leader in his Squadron and has 1,347 hours time in the air. He is level headed and is not given to dramatization.

Howard De Forrey, 2nd Lt., AF 2nd 0756, 2nd Strategic Sq. McGuire AFB, Trenton, NJ, the radar observer on this flight substantiates all the facts above and has nothing to add to the other witnesses were jumping back 2% of the 5th Trainers Sq. at McGuire AFB, Trenton, NJ and 1st Edward G. Smith and 2nd Lt. Charles W. Masters of the 2nd Strategic Sq. McGuire AFB, Trenton, NJ. The flight took place on enclosed sheet 1.

2. Howard De Cardillo and 1st Lt. AF 2 2415 AFB, of the 2nd Strategic Sq. McGuire AFB, Trenton, NJ on 6 December 1952 at 1530 GMT, while on a climb out from McGuire AFB at about 5,000 feet noticed this object or light to the south of the field. He leveled with it about 20,000 feet and climbed to 20,000 feet at which time the object or light seemed to be below his altitude. The colors of the light varied from white, amber and red. At one time or another each color was predominate. The light varied in intensity and during the brightness seemed to swell with flaring edges ( ★ ) then returning to round when light decreased. At no time was a pattern noted in changes or variation during the 45 minute observation. It was noted that if the lights were that of an aircraft using normal navigation lights the observation would have been approximately 10 miles.

There was no observation as to the physical form of the object as well as no estimate of sound heard. It did appear as though the object or light was changing altitude occasionally. All the sighting was done visually and all attempts to pick it up on radar proved negative. The above was noted during the flight on which Lt. De Forrey's mission out to sea and upon returning to base the object was still seen to be in the same location (74 degrees 50 minutes west and 40 degrees zero minutes north) and at the same altitude.

The visibility was unrestricted with a few scattered clouds. To resumed activity or meteorological conditions existed that could account for the sighting and there is no material evidence in existence of the sighting.

The aircraft being on a rotary active air defense mission was unable to take any interceptor action on the sighting, but did notify the controller (tower) of the sighting.

The pilot is level headed and is not the type to be easily provoked. His judgment is average and reliable. He has ANG towers in the area.

Charles W. Easter, 2nd Lt., AO 2 264 770, the radar observer on this flight substantiates the pilot's facts with some exceptions. He wouldn't commit himself on the altitude or distance of the object or light.

Other witnesses were Darling Jack 24 of the 5th Bombing Gp, an entire crew, Frenkin, 2nd. and Robert F. Standley, 1st Lt., AO 1 208 967, with his radar observer, Howard R. Perry, 2nd Lt., AO 948 975, of the 2nd Bombing Gp, including 2nd. Flight Path No. on Enclosure 1a.

F-94 aircraft was vectored towards an unidentified flying object by GCI (Silverton) at approximately 1:40 local and remained in chase until 2000 hours. The coordinates of the first sighting were 76 degrees 20 minutes west and 40 degrees 20 minutes north. All sightings were visual, made between 15,000 and 22,500 feet. The object was moving on a dead ahead and level course of 260 degrees, the pursuing aircraft flew at 200 knots during the entire stern chase. To contact was made on AN/APG-5 radar. Visibility was 20 to 50 miles air to ground and weather was CAVU. The object appeared to be changing; in color from amber to white to red and appeared to fade once before the chase was abandoned due to lack of fuel.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Ltr from 2nd Fighter-Interceptor Sqdn, McGuire AFB, Trentson, NJ REPORT NO. TR-6-52

4. Statement by William P. Manahan, Pvt, USA, RA 124 24 762, stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey, 60th Infantry Regiment, 9th Division)

At approximately 1730-1850 hrs:

On 6 December 1952 Private Manahan sighted a bright object or light approximately 15 degrees above horizon in a southwest direction from Mount Holly, New Jersey. With the aid of a landmark, the observer was able to discern that the object flew in a straight course except for one westerly deflection of 3 to 5 degrees. The object seemed to be revolving from right to left with what appeared to be the tail light intensity, increasing and diminishing to the observer. The color of the light varied from white to yellow intermittently with no set pattern observed.

The size of the object never seemed to change during the hour of observation but the change in intensity seemed to swell the light from 1/8th inch circle (original size)( O ), to a 3/8th inch flared star shaped with an indistinguishable number of flaring edges ( * ). Weather at the time of the sighting was clear and visibility was unlimited. (See point #4 on Inclosure A). Distance and altitude not omitted.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TD-Ela/Mr. Bryant/clh/74201
SUBJECT: Evaluation of Case 15, 6 Dec 52                                     4 Oct 62

TO:    TD-E (Lt. Col. Friend)

1. It is not possible to definitely state the cause of the blips
on the scope.

2. However, three possible causes for the phenomena reported are
discussed below:

    a. Beacon returns, triggered by another radar,

    b. Returns from variations in the atmosphere,

    c. Ducting.

3. Although the report says the blips did not have the relative
positions which a beacon return would give, the sketch submitted
does appear to have the configuration which might be expected of
a beacon. If a beacon was being triggered by a radar other than
the one about which this report was made, it could easily provide
returns which would jump around on the scope as described. If
the plane's transmitter power was very low, it is possible that
it would not be strong enough to trigger the beacon. This could
explain the fact that the coastline was not seen on the radar,
although the gas flames from the oil refineries were seen. I
would expect the radar normally to see further than the eye.

4. If the transmitted power was normal, blips could have been
caused by variations in the atmosphere. These frequently cause
blips which move across the scope with speeds varying from very
slow to thousands of miles per hour.

5. If ducting were present - and over water, this condition is
not unusual - the targets could have been reflections from objects
many times the radar's normal distant from the set. These
targets may act rationally at times, and at times not, and may
be from stationary objects on the ground.
