I don't believe the blue-white light came from the same source as the original sighting's source. The incident's peculiarities are indivcative of little confirmatory value. I agree perhaps the incident's significance was overexaggerated on the report, and personnel read something unusual into an incident which they normally would have recognized or have dismissed as of no consequence.

CASE # 39
6 December 1952

Off Coast of Louisiana

On the return leg from Florida to Galveston, Texas, training mission, student navigator's celestial, I requested the student's radar to turn on the scope, which had been off from 30 miles W of Tampa, and see if he could pick up the coast where on the 100 mile range. After the set was on for a sufficient time to warm up, I was given permission to turn on the brilliance of the scope, both student radar and mine were checked for coastline returns and found none. At this time the set had not been calibrated. My attention then was attracted from the scope for a period of time.

At 0525 CST Radar called for my attention to the scope and I first noted small bright blips returns, approximately 10 with no specific grouping such as a radar beacon for transmitting. As the brilliance was increased one at a time, the blips moved out across the scope more than one range marker. Radar stated at that time he had 50-mile range on, indicating a movement of 12-14 miles. With each successive revolution, the blips continued 5Â±-20 miles from the ship at a bearing of 70 deg and then out of the scope. At 1:50 deg Radar gave the Instructor Flight Engineer the time and distance which was computed to be over 8000 yards in about 5 minutes and speeds were recomputed. During this period, student navigator and Instructor audio viewed the aux. scope and confirmed my observations. At this time I called for Radar to calibrate his set to eliminate any possibility of malfunction. He did this speedily and when he scanned the scope once more the blips reappeared moving 25 across the scope. I called off two separate blip track and position in relation to the 3/5 by the clock system over interphone of the ship and as they passed at 3 o'clock, the Instructor Engineer visibly saw a blue-white white flare go from front.

The shared image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report and does not contain any photographs. The text on the page describes a UFO sighting incident, including details about the object's trajectory, speed, and disappearance. The text also mentions that various tests were conducted to check for known aerial phenomena, but the results were negative.

CASE #25 (CONT'D)
TO WHOM THIS MAY CONCERN: Contact was broken off at 0235 after a group of the blips merged into a 3 inch curved arc about 30 miles from our e/e at 330 deg and proceeded across the scope and off it at a computed speed of over 9000 mph. At all times during the contact the e/e was level and stable, the weather was clear, not a cloud in the sky and visibility was excellent. There was a full moon giving excellent water reflections. The e/e was flying long range cruise at the time. Radar checked the blips as nil and angle full up and down. One group of blips after the scope was observed were noted, after moving from 330 deg to 150 deg across the scope, to are about 3 and dving in behind us at approximately 30 miles and maintain speed and distance for approximately 10 seconds and then disappear.
ATIC Comment:
All possibilities were checked for known aerial phenomena with negative results.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.: A-3336-52
PAGE: 1 OF 2 PAGES

1. Report did not reach Intelligence Agencies until 9 December 1952. At this time additional information was lacking concerning details of sighting.

2. Information received indicates the objects to be of strangely shaped and about 3 inches in length on radar scope and visually as blue-white flashes of light with no discernible trail.

3. No characteristic features were noted in the flight sightings. Visual sightings confirm radar contacts. The objects were irregular in shape, giving off a blue-white light, which was observed from the ground for a period of about 10 minutes and was not tracked on radar. 
Radar contacts were obtained at 25,000 feet indicating a speed of approximately 1,800 mph and of an easterly heading. However, the objects were observed to make abrupt turns and changes in direction.

4. Sighting was on 6 December 1952.

5. Observers were men from both main and air crews and visually from flight. We was [sic] at coordinates 39'30" N, 74 '20" W on a true heading 213Â°.

6. Their various positions of all are positive in their sightings and this confirms the speed and direction of the objects.

7. Weather was CAVOK. No wind. Temperature 10Â° C. It is not known whether there was any meteorological or conditions remarkable or otherwise, which would account for sightings.

8. There is no physical evidence of sighting.

9. No attempt was made to intercept/track or otherwise interrupt object.

10. No other aircraft were observed in area at time of sighting.

11. Conclusions of reporting officer and of such duration are to preclude any other interpretation. However, as visual sightings are indecisive and of little confirmatory value.

As the approximately 11:23 G.C.T. an announcement was made over the interphone, to the effect that unidentified objects were spotted on the radar scope.

As the time of this announcement I was relieving the student aircraft observer and detailed the crewmembers to their usual stations.

The radar operator clocked the objects (about four or five were clocked) and detailed and X competed the air speed of the objects to average about 400 to 500 m.p.h.

While during the period 11:23 G.C.T. and 11:37 G.C.T. the radar operator tracked the objects to an approximate altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet, and I observed the objects on the radar scope. I then saw the objects make a steep climb and disappear under the scope at an altitude of about 40,000 to 50,000 feet.

On 9/23/52 at approximately 2325 hours I observed, at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, two unidentifiable objects that were moving at a very high rate of speed in a northerly direction and which were not ordinary aircraft. These objects made erratic circles and swerves and disappeared from sight each time I observed them. They appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 5,000 and 10,000 feet.

At this time I observed one small, almost round object approaching the center of the scene from an angle estimated to be about 10 o'clock. After another sweep of the objects, this one also disappeared from sight. What appeared to be a fluorescent glow surrounded the objects, and a pulsating red light was probably visible on the smaller object, which seemed to be in the rear. However, this was not as distinct as I observed on the larger objects. Flight conditions were stable.

My second observation about two minutes later was of three objects about the same size and shape as the previous ones. They were moving in an erratic pattern and were about halfway between center and edge of the scope. Flight conditions stable.

On 6 December 1952, while flying over the Gulf of Mexico towards Galveston, Texas, I noticed an unidentified object approaching our aircraft at a terrific rate of speed. The object appeared to be elliptical in shape and I then noticed two similar objects, each about the same size as the first, trailing our aircraft. The entire one is losc to the object usually and seas it at a close range.

The color of the object was a bright bluish white and seemed to have a metallic appearance. The object closed to within 1/4 mile of our aircraft, hovered for a few seconds, then moved off at an extremely high speed and was not a jet, propeller driven aircraft or optical illusion.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

This document contains the following text:

"I, MAIENANN, WILLIAM V., A02030433, do certify that: 

On 1 December 1952 at approx. 2145, I was on a training mission in an F-94 aircraft flying from McGuire AFB, New Jersey, to Thermal, California. At approx. 2155, while over a point approx. 25 miles west of McGuire AFB, over the Atlantic Ocean, I observed a bright light, similar to that of a bright star, which had been off for some 30 miles west of McGuire AFB. The object was observed for approx. 3 minutes and it remained stationary. It then started moving at a rapid rate of speed, which I estimated to be 1,500 to 2,000 mph, and it made an abrupt turn to the left (south) and continued on in a southerly direction. The object then appeared to blend into the stars and was lost to my observation. During this period, the object seemed to change colors, first from a bright white light to a red-orange to a green color and then back to a bright white light. I checked my instruments and found no malfunctions which could have accounted for what I observed. I am thoroughly familiar with all types of aircraft, both jet and conventional, and I am positive this was not an aircraft of any type known to me. This report is made at the request of my commanding officer and I have been instructed to make it."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: McGuire AFB, NEW JERSEY
THROUGH: MAIN AIR INTELLIGENCE SECTION, EAST DISTRICT, AIR INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 
TO: COMMANDING GENERAL, AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE CENTER, ATT: OPERATIONS ANALYSIS DIVISION
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Seen on a Training Flight
1. On 6 December 1952, while on a training flight at approximately 13,000 feet over the Pine Barrens area of New Jersey, a flight of 4 aircraft observed a bright highly maneuverable object which appeared to be intensely luminous and was viewed by the entire flight during the time it was under observation.

2. The object, which was first observed by the pilot lead aircraft when it suddenly appeared approximately 20 degrees above the horizon at a bearing of approximately 320 degrees from the aircraft, remained in view for approximately 20 to 30 seconds. Initially it was sighted as a bright spot of light, then it changed shape and displayed considerable maneuverability, appearing to be at times elongated, circular and pulsating. At one point it appeared to be approximately three times the size of a B-36 bomber. Although the observer's initial impression was that the object was well beyond their aircraft, the rapid maneuvers and changes in apparent size suggested that the object was in fact comparatively close. No vapor trail or exhaust emission was observed at any time.

3. All observing was done visually and with radar contact was lost at the termination of the sighting. 

4. The pilot was at approximately 13,000 feet and 10 miles west of a heading of 330 degrees from the McGuire Air Force Base when the sighting occurred. The object was observed to be flying at a heading of approximately 220 degrees at a speed estimated to be in excess of 600 knots. The object was apparently level with the aircraft and this altitude was maintained for 20 to 30 seconds. It then climbed rapidly to an altitude estimated to be 35,000 feet and headed in a southeasterly direction, disappearing from view in approximately 60 seconds.

5. There were no activities meteorological or otherwise that could have accounted for the sighting and there was no physical evidence to substantiate the claim that an unidentified object was present, other than the reports by the pilots involved.

The text output from the document is as follows:

"The pilot is a flight leader in his squadron and has 1,247 hours time in the air. He is rated second and is not given to exaggeration. Reported the following: On the 9th of December 1952 at approximately 10:20 hours, he was on a routine training flight in the vicinity of Asbury Park, New Jersey. The radar observer on this flight substantiates all the facts above and has nothing to add to the other observations and interpretations. The object was first observed at an altitude of about 28,000 feet and it appeared to descend to an altitude of about 12,000 feet as it approached the area. The object changed direction and then proceeded to climb at a rapid rate, estimated to be in excess of 600 mph, disappearing from sight in about 10 to 15 seconds. The pilot stated that the object appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and circular in shape, a luminous white in color, and appeared to be a metallic type object. The object was under intelligent control and during the brightness seemed to swell with fiery-close effect, then returning to original size and luminosity. At no time was there any sound or trail associated with the object as it maneuvered. It did appear as though the object or light was changing altitude considerably. All the sighting was done visually and all attempts to pick up the object on radar were negative. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes. The pilot stated that in his opinion the speed of the object was in excess of 600 mph and that the type of maneuver observed would have been impossible for any known type of aircraft using normal aviation flight techniques. The observation would have been approximately 10 miles. It did appear as though the object or light was changing altitude considerably.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

CONTROL SYMBOL: IR-233
PREPARED BY: Capt ROBERT P. MASCHAR, F-12, FWS, USAF
STATION: McGuire AFB, NEW JERSEY
DATE: 8 Dec 1952
COPY NO.: 1

DIS., New Jersey, 6038 February Resgtisrrent. A approval: AT 1750-1830 EST.

Qn 8 December 1952 at approx. 1725 an object or light appeared bright in the sky approximately 1700-1930 EST.

Imitatly 15 degrees to the bright object in a northerly direction was another object or light appearing. With the aid of a landmark, the observer was able to determine that the objects travelled in a straight course approximately 8 to 10 degrees of arc.

The object seemed to be revolving from right to left with what appeared to be the tall light intensity, increasing and diminishing. The color of the light varied from white to yellow with no red patterns observed.

The size of the object never seemed to change during the hour of observation but the change in intensity seemed to swell the light from 1/8th inch circle (original size) to a 3/8th inch circle. Flared edges (1" x) . Weather at the time of the sighting was clear and visibility was unlimited. (See Point 6 on Inclosure #2). Distance and altitude not computed.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Foreign Technology Division of the Air Force Systems Command, regarding the "Evaluation of Case 15, 6 Dec 52".

The text of the document is as follows:

HEADQUARTERS'

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

REPLY TO
ATTN OF:	ED-Eis/Mr. Bryant/eln/74201

SUBJECT:	Evaluation of Case 15, 6 Dec 52

TO:	TD-E (Lt. Col. Friend)

1.	It is not possible to definitely state the cause of the blips on the scope.

2.	However, three possible causes for the phenomena reported are discussed below:
a.	Beacon returns, triggered by another radar,
b.	Returns from variations in the atmosphere,
c.	Ducting.

3.	Although the report says the blips did not have the relative positions which a beacon return would give, the sketch submitted does appear to have the configuration which might be expected of a beacon, if a beacon was being triggered by a radar other than the one about which this report was made. If the transmitter power was very low, it is possible that it would not trigger the beacon. This could explain the fact that the cautions was not seen on the radar, and the flicker of the flames from the radar's scanner were more prominent than the beacon.

4.	If the transmitted power was normal, blips could have been caused by variations in the atmosphere. These frequently cause blips which move across the scope with speeds varying from very slow to very fast.

5.	If ducting were present - and over water, this condition is not unusual - the target could have been reflections from objects many times the radar's normal range distant from the set. These reflections may not necessarily be of a timer, at this time, and may be from stationary objects on the ground.
