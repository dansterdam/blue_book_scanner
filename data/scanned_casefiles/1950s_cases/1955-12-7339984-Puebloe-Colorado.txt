SUBJECT: (Unclassified) UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT Sighted by Sam T. Taylor near La Veta, Colorado, 25 November 1955
SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO: Commander
Air Defense Command
Ent Air Force Base
Colorado

1. The Honourable [redacted] Floor Leader, Colorado State Senate, in a letter written to the Denver Office, Federal Bureau of Investigations, dated 8 December 1955, stated that on or about 25 November 1955 he had seen an unidentified object in the vicinity of La Veta, Colorado.

2. The Denver Office, FBI, referred the matter to this office by letter dated 9 December 1955. Attempts were made by this office to contact [redacted] at his home in Walsenburg, Colorado.

3. On 12 January 1956, Special Agent JAMES A. ROGERS, of this office, interviewed Senator [redacted] at the Senate Chambers, Colorado State Capitol Building. Senator [redacted] verified the date and location where he had seen the object. He described the object as being shaped like a dirigible, slightly barrel-shaped with a front end and tapering toward the tail. He compared the object when he saw it in the sky three-fourths of the diameter of a fifty gallon barrel and approximately twice the length of such a tapering tail.

He said that the object was greenish-blue in color, appeared luminous, seemed to be of a jelly-like substance and had no distinguishable features. The object did not make any sound nor was any exhaust or trail made. He estimated that the object was at approximately 15,000 feet elevation above sea level, traveled about ten miles during his observation and suddenly disappeared from view in ten seconds. He estimated that the object was in his sight for approximately five seconds and he estimated the speed of the object as being about one-half the speed of a meteor. He stated that the object suddenly appeared from view almost overhead, at a 45 degree angle, leveled off and ascended at approximately a 30 degree angle until its disappearance. He stated that the flight line of the object would have been from northwest to northeast. He estimated the altitude of the object approximately 7000 to 6000 feet. He said that the time of the sighting was approximately 1030 hours 25 November 1955, that there was an unlimited ceiling, and that there were no clouds or thunderstorms in the area. In conclusion, Senator [redacted] stated

that it is his belief that Mr. and Mrs. ________, owners of the Blaine
Cafe, Walsenburg, Colorado, had also observed an unidentified object on the
same date and that it could possibly have been the same on that was
served.

4. On 18 January 1956, S/A LEONARD R. HEDGES, of this office, interviewed Mr. and Mrs. JOHN SOSNY, Walsenburg, Colorado. The ________ stated
that on or about 1 December 1955 when driving approximately twenty-nine miles
south of Pueblo at LOCO HOUSE they observed an unidentified flying object.
________ stated that his attention was called to the object by what could be
called a vapor trail. He said that the object appeared to be white in color,
was shaped roughly like a cigarette with a pure white color, apparently resting at the top. He said that they observed the object for approximately
twenty minutes and that its movement was too slow for a jet. He said that
there were no clouds in the sky on that day and there is no normal air travel
in that area. He said that the last he saw of the object was when he was
approaching Walsenburg when it apparently disappeared over the Saley.

5. This letter is classified ________ pursuant to authority contained in paragraph 24a, AFR 205-1.
