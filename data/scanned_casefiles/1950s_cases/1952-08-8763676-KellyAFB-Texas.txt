TEXT OUTPUT:

THE COMPASS ROSE AT KELLY AF BASE, TEXAS IS LOCATED AT THE END OF RUNWAY 8-27 AND IS USED FREQUENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SWINGING THE COMPASSES ON R-26 AIRCRAFT. THE COMPASS ROSE IS LOCATED ON R-54 APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE CENTER OF THE DAILY WORK AREA, MAKING IT EASY TO RECOGNIZE ANY UNUSUAL PHENOMENA.

ON 14 AUGUST, 1952 AT APPROXIMATELY 1545 HOURS, SEVEN OF US WERE WAITING IN THE JOINT SCHOOL AT THE COMPASS ROSE WHEN ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES POINTED OUTSIDE AND SAID, "LOOK". IMMEDIATELY EVERYONE WAS ON THEIR FEET BEHOLDING A SIGHT NEVER BEFORE WITNESSED BY ANY OF US.

A ROUND OBJECT HAD APPEARED ABOUT ONE-HALF MILE DUE NORTH OF US AT ABOUT AN ESTIMATED 20,000 FEET AND WAS TRAVELING AT A RATHER FAST RATE OF SPEED DUE WEST. THE CRAFT WAS VERY EASILY SPOTTED AS IT APPEARED TO BE OF METALLIC NATURE AND REFLECTED THE SUNLIGHT AS IT MOVED THROUGH THE SKY. GRADUALLY IT STARTED A LEFT CLIMBING TURN AND CONTINUED ON UNTIL IT HAD COMPLETED A 180 DEGREE TURN AND WAS HEADING BACK THE WAY IT CAME, ABOUT 30,000 FEET. WE WATCHED IT GO BEHIND A SMALL CLOUD AND DISAPPEAR.

WHILE WE WERE DISCUSSING THE THING, IT REAPPEARED AND AGAIN IT WAS TRAVELING ABOUT AS BEFORE, DUE WEST AND AGAIN AT ABOUT 30,000 FEET. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT WE REPORTED THE OBJECT TO THE KELLY CONTROL TOWER, GIVING ITS APPROXIMATE LOCATION AND ALTITUDE. WE SEVERAL MINUTES, THE OBJECT WOULD APPEAR FOR A SHORT WHILE THEN DISAPPEAR INTO THE DISTANCE.

Space gradually growing smaller and dimmer with distance. Each appearance would be in the general vicinity but at a different spot. The last time we saw it, the thing appeared almost directly overhead and was travelling faster than ever toward the north where it finally paled away. So far as we could tell, it must have travelled at about 1500 miles per hour and executed maneuvers that did not have hover or perform any sharp movements such as radical directional changes or quick zigzag movements.

We were all at a loss as to a logical explanation of this sighting.

I certify that the statement above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
