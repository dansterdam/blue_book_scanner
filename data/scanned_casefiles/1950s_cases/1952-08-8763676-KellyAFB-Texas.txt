In compliance with AF Letter 200-3, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) Object was round and size undetermined as estimates from the observers vary from a few inches to a beacon ball (actual size). Object was luminous color much like aluminum from which conventional aircraft are made. There was only one object sighted, however, its intermittent appearances and disappearance was a continuous phenomenon. No aerodynamic features, trail or exhaust, or visible propulsion system noted. Speed was not over 150 mph. No conventional or other aerial activity noted.

(2) Time of sighting was 1545 hours, CST, 14 August 1952. Length of the observed was approximately thirty minutes (not a constant observation due to its intermittent nature).

(3) A visual surface observation without optical or electronic equipment was made.

(4) Observers were at the Compass Rose, located at the end of runway 3-27 at Kelly AF Base, Texas. Object was first sighted about one half mile due north from observers bearing West at an estimated altitude of between twenty and thirty thousand feet.

(5) Object was observed by the following listed Civilian employees at Kelly AF Base, Texas and AAC Harold S. Sparks Field, 7th Repair Sq, Kelly AFB, Texas:

[Names are redacted]

Observers have been employed at Kelly AF Base, Texas for some years and have worked constantly around aircraft and should be familiar with most types of conventional aircraft.

(6) Fair weather prevailed at the time of the sighting.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, is known to have existed which may account for the sighting.

(8) There is no physical evidence of the sighting.

(9) No interception or identification action taken.

(10) Location of any air traffic in the general area at the time of the sighting unknown.

STATEMENT

The Compass Rose at Kelly AF Base, Texas is located at the end of runway 9-27 and is used frequently for the purpose of swinging the compasses on B-36 aircraft. The Compass Rose is located on flat open terrain affording an unobstructed view of the sky making it easy to spot any unusual phenomenon.

On 14 August 1952 at approximately 1545 hours, seven of us were waiting in the parts shack at the Compass Rose for another aircraft to swing when one of the employees pointed outside and said, "Look".

Immediately everyone was on his feet beholding a sight never before witnessed by any of us.

A round object had appeared about one-half mile due North of us at about an estimated 20,000 feet and was travelling at a rather fast rate of speed due West. The craft was very easily spotted as it appeared to be of metallic nature and reflected the sunlight as it moved through the sky. Gradually it started a left climbing turn and continued this until it had completed a 180 degree turn and was heading back due East at about 30,000 feet. We watched it go behind a small cloud and disappear.

While we were discussing this thing, it reappeared and again was travelling about as before, due West and again at about 30,000 feet.

It was at this time that we reported the object to the Kelly Control Tower, giving its approximate location and altitude. For several minutes, the object would appear for a short while then disappear into


- page 16 -

Space gradually growing smaller and dimmer with distance. Each appearance would be in the same general vicinity but at a different spot. The last time we saw it, the thing appeared almost directly overhead and was travelling faster than ever toward the North where it finally paled away. So far as we could tell, it must have travelled at about 1500 miles per hour and executed maneuvers with the greatest of ease; however, it did not hover or perform any sharp maneuvers such as radical directional changes or quick zig-zag movements.

We were all at a loss as to a logical explanation of this sighting.

I certify that the statement above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

[The signature is blacked out]
