In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

DATE: September 11, 1959

Sailing on course 292°-50'W by 79°-25'W at 7 knots an hour at 333°. Approximately 0830 11:13 P.M. spotted an unidentified flying object flying at 350° at approximately 15,000 feet. The object came from the horizon or from a cloud with a bright orange-orange glow surrounding the vessel in a near parabolic shape. I estimated its position across the stern of the ship at 79°30'W by 30°8'N. The vessel continued across our stern in short wavern movements, it flew changing from orange to gray or misty, the parabolic shape changed to making the shape larger and more visible.

A.F.

Dear Sirs:

I have just recently completed a cruise with the Naval Reserve. I was placed on the destroyer U.S.S. Robinson DD-562. We left Charleston, S.C., on Tuesday, July 21, 1959.

While standing quartermaster watch on the Robinson's bridge, I witnessed a very strange spectacle. I hope your can give me a truthful explanation.

I was standing the 2000 to 2400 watch on July 25, 1959, when I noticed this object. Our position


- page 7 -

at the time I estimate to be
approximately 29°-50' North and 77°-25'West
We were sailing at 7 knots on course
334° when 2313 P.M. an unidentified
object flying at course 250° at 25,000
feet crossed our stern. The object came
out of a cloud with a bright orange
glow surrounding its vessel in a parable
shape. Eym.

I estimated the position of
the object to have been 30°-5'North by 79°-30'West

As the vessel moved across our
stern in what seemed erratic movements, its glow
changed to one of white or gray. The shape
of the parable also changed, becoming
large and more visible

[The document also includes two hand-drawn diagrams of the object, with color and shape annotations like "white", "orange", "gray", and "bright"]


- page 8 -

I realize that our position was close to Cape Canaveral and the missile launching area. I think that this was more than a missile, however, if identified it would not be verified. If it was a missile, would you please tell me.

If you think it wasn't a missile then you surely have a record on odds for its verification as it was close to the Florida coast. I would like confirmation that what I saw belongs to the N.S. and was under U.S. control.

I'll certainly appreciate any help or explanation that you can give me.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]
