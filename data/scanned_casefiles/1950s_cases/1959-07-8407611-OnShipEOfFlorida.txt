The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no photographic images.

The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "skyline" and an "A" point and a "B" point along the curved line, demonstrating how high an object appeared above the horizon when first sighted.

The second sketch contains two images. The larger image shows a person standing on a road with buildings and trees in the background. The smaller image shows a person standing in a landscape with mountains in the background.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet, which includes a written description of an observed event.

According to the text, on September 11, 1959, an object was observed flying at approximately 23,000 feet at a speed of 700-750 mph. The object was estimated to be about 15-20 feet in diameter and had a bright orange glow, surrounded by a parabolic shape. The object was observed crossing the ship's stern at an estimated position of 79째30' E by 30째S N. The observer stated that the vessel continued across the observer's stern, moving from north to south, and that the object disappeared behind some clouds.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document that appears to be part of a report or document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO reports.

Text from the document:

Aug. 5, 1959
Dear S-to:
I have just recently completed a cruise with the Moral Reserve. It was placed on the destroyer, U.S.S. Robinson, DD 562. We left Charleston, S.C. on Tuesday, July 21, 1959.

While standing quarantines, watch on the Robinson's bridge, I witnessed a very strange spectacle. I hope your can give me a truthful explanation.

It was standing the 2400 watch on July 25, 1959, when I noticed this light. Our position was about 650 miles east of Florida.

- page 7 -

The image contains a handwritten report describing an observation of an unidentified object flying over the ocean near Florida. The report states that the object was first observed at 2:13 PM, flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet and crossing the observer's ship at a heading of 350 degrees. The object was described as coming out of a cloud with a bright orange glow, appearing to be a parabolic shape. The report includes a simple sketch showing the object's shape and a description of its movement across the observer's ship.

The report text is as follows:

"at the time it was reported to be at approximately 34 50' North and 77 25' West. We were sailing at 7 Knots on course 334 when 2:13 P.M on unmidentified object flying at course 350 at 35,000 feet crossed our stern. The object came out of a cloud with a bright orange glow surrounding the vessel which was a parabolic shape. I estimated the position of the object to have been 30 5' North by 77 30' West. 

As the vessel moved across our stern in what seemed movements, it gave the appearance of an article or group. The shape of the parabola also changed, becoming larger and more visible."

M s Machen 
I judge that an position close to Cape Canaveral and the missile tracking area, I think this was a missile, than a missile, however, if unidentified IT would not be verified, if it was a missile, would you please tell me if you think it was a missile than your surely have a record on file verification as it was close to the british coast, I would like confirmation that what I saw belongs to the U.S. and was under U.S. control. 
It will certainly appreciate any help or orientation that you can give me.
Sincerely,
M s Machen
