On March 5, 1953 about 1725 hours, I, S/Sgt. Buford J. Halley was in the Base Hall eating chow when S/Sgt. Hall Snoden, CCS B at Control Van TLOC, started that he had received word from Captain Harrington, Base Operations that there was a strange object sighted over the Poinsett Area at Merry South Carolina and was heading toward Congaree, and wanted us to remain on the air.

He stated that Captain Harrington was trying to get a plane to intercept the strange object. At that time I alerted Major Russ Ames, 1st Air Force that I was in the Base Hall and our section to go on the air. I called the C. Q. here at Congaree to call the Air National Guard to see if they had a plane available to intercept the strange object.

They advised that if they would have a P-51 airborne in a few minutes they would scramble it. Call Sign 4522. That he would contact us on 141.50. About this time 5622 was airborne the bogies added 20 miles north of Congaree. The rate of the target was 170. At this time I was called to scramble 1 F-84 and Major Wayne took control of the A/C. I got in contact with the Commanding Officer, Major Butterfield to get more information whether to remain on the air. Major Butterfield informed me that 1 F-84 was scrambled.

I was on the air. Major Wayne informed me that they were tracking a target and that there would be an A/C from the ANG available to intercept. Bogies at 175 I received a call from WP that AF 401 was calling an channel 2 (143.5 mc). In my reported his position as 8 thousand feet, at Congaree 8 thousand feet. At that time tracked 2 reported a target 325° 105 miles. The target now was heading north with 6 thousand feet. They also reported that they had no other weapon. I assumed this was the bogies. I gave AF 401 a vector of 220°. We reported already 320° 100 miles. The bogies moved 320° 105 miles and failed to intercept.

I informed AF 401 that the bogies had still not been contacted. Bogie appeared 335° 98 miles which put the bogies falling 037°. I then gave the fighter a vector of 000° heading him toward the bogies. Actual reported initial target 210° 105 miles which on the map indicated that was the fighter. Gave his hlo actually to the north, to the map and he was now 2 miles north of Charleston, S. C.

Bogie was 240° 98 miles. Bogie position from fighter 12 o'clock 15 miles. Bogie was informed to orbit there. Bogie reappeared 345° 100 miles. The bogie was now on a heading of 020°. I gave 401 then another vector of 320°. I then informed fighter 401 that bogie was now over Salisbury, N. C. I then dead reckoned the fighter toward the bogies.

The bogie faded 336 pick miles which is over Salisbury, N. C. I informed the fighter 401 that a reconnaissance aircraft at 320° 107 miles. Not knowing whether the plot was the fighter or the bogie I had the fighter do an identification turn which indicated the plot was not the fighter.

I then informed 401 the bogies was 325° from Congaree and gave him a vector of 250°. Position of bogies from fighter 12 o'clock 25 miles. At that time the bogies had done an state turn and was now heading 080°. I then gave 401 a new heading of 025°, and at that time the bogies faded. The fighter 401 called and said he would orbit around Charleston, N. C. a few minutes. Later 401 called me and informed me he had only 25 minutes of fuel remaining. I gave him a vector 120° to Sumter. To reported over Sumter and said he had them also in sight. At 1246.

AF 401 was cleared from our control to go to baker channel to pan cake. After I had cleared AF 401 to go to AF 599 called in a vector to bogie. I informed him that bogie had faded and we had dropped the miss-. I told him he was cleared to go to baker channel to pan cake. Entire mission with AF 401 was conducted by dead reckoning wilkins plots received from Framed 2. At no time during attempted intercept did I exceed Control have radar contact with fighter or bogie, due to blind zone of our radar coverage. (See Radar Calibration report dated 9 January 1953).

STATEMENT

At 1655 5 March 1953, I received a call from Captain Herrington telling me that there was a strange object hovering over the restricted area near Augusta, Ga. He said to put exceed radar back on the air and try to pick up object on same. At 1705 radar was back on the air and in the target over restricted area.

When the call from Captain Herrington just came in I immediately called RADC orderly room controller, receiving no answer I then called the Mess Hall to see if any officers on radar personnel NCOs were available. At approximately 1715 3/Sgt John Hays and 3/Sgt Kelly arrived to give assistance. At that time we had approximately 7 plots on the unknown object. The initial plot J01627. The 7th plot J05552. The object was moving at the time as a heading of 060° towards Congaree. Then the object was within 11 miles of Congaree be circled so to remain 11 miles from base. He then took a direct North heading when due north of base. The object then faded at 360° 20 miles at 1725.

I took over the job of keeping the log and assuring communications while 3/Sgt Hays and Kelly worked with 1/2 cent to investigate.

At 1715 hours, 5 March 1953, I, John Hayes, was in the mess hall when S/Sgt Buford Kelley informed me that a strange object was sighted on our radar screen and viewed to be in our area, and a target was on our radar scope and the radarized area. S/Sgt Kelley and I proceeded to the control van. Upon arrival there I saw an object on the radar bearing MAC° 25 miles from congress. The object was flying northeasterly direction at about 220 miles per hour. S/Sgt Kelley called the orderly room and had the O.D. to call the National Guardanger and ask if they had an aircraft that could be used for interception.

S/Sgt Kelley told me that a F-51 National Guard 4522 would be airborne in 15 minutes and to intercept track 1. At 1725 track 1 had faded from the radar scope. WO 4522 called me on dog channel (121.5). I informed him that the object had faded from the radar but to search area north of Camden, S.C. The pilot of WO 4522 informed me that he had enough fuel for about one hour of flying. There were no further contacts. At 1800 I told WO 4522 to drop mission as he had only about 30 minutes of fuel remaining. Then WO 4522 was over Camden. I informed him that aircraft was orbiting in the vicinity of the prohibited area, and if he had enough fuel left to take a look at it. The pilot said he had enough fuel and he would take a look. I gave him a vector of 220° for base. At 1822 when over 220° when over Congaree Base. WO 4522 made a tally ho on an aircraft and reported its constitution. At that time 1816 I gave him a vector of 220° for base. At 1822 WO 4522 said he had field in sight and was changing to Baker Channel for Fam Cake.

April 9, 1953

1st Lieutenant Polk, Olsson
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear First Lieutenant:

Thank you for your letter and comments. I too think that we are getting someplace. This system of weekly reports and comments will continue. We should like to make a collection of the truly unknown cases with their follow ups so that a true scientific evaluation can someday be made. There have been no such follow-up cases in recent months. With some critical points the cases had little scientific value. I want to get to the bottom of the natural phenomena behind all this. If this is possible we should in time be able to set up some experiments to demonstrate these phenomena, and this will be the real proof of the pudding. This can come only by selecting proper cases and letting the majority of them go by the boards.

I hope that you will continue with this work and that we can have occasional meetings.

Well, here goes on this batch of 16 March. Of the 12 cases in this batch, 4 were without question Venus, and a 5th might have been two UFOs in an aircraft, data on 5 of these 16 cases were March 6 (Lewis Center), 4:15 and 11. Those of 6 Erie, Penn. and 7 March seem most probable to have been some unknown light aircraft.

Now to those that are of some interest, the most important is 5 March at Shaw AFB. Has the detailed report come yet? I should like very much to see this. I particularly wonder how the object could have speed 200 mph and still have been observed 1 hour. Very important here to establish identifiable visual and radar coincidence. In the sighting at Shaw AFB, but seen at Congaree AFB a few hours later refer to the same thing.

With reference to the Beale Falls, West 27 Feb military report and finally, on 2 March, Luke AFB, was the 30 feet of gun camera film ever developed?

Question: Is it permissible to keep the typed copies of the CY reports?

Dear First Lieutenant:

Thank you for your letter and comments. I too think that we are getting somewhere. This system of weekly reporting and comments--now POLICY UP---has continuity. With your aid I am able to make a collection of the truly unknown cases with their follow ups so that a true scientific evaluation can be made.

Before these has been so much frustration. Without a follow up on critical points the base data held little scientific value. I want to get to the bottom of the natural phenomena behind all this. If this is possible we should in time be able to set up some experiments to demonstrate these phenomena, and this will be the real proof of the pudding. This can come only by selecting proper cases and letting the majority of them go by the boards.

I hope that you will continue with this work and that we can have occasional meetings.

Well, batch 4 were without particular data and follow-up.

Just for the record, the Venus cases were March 6 (Leeds Center), 8,10 and 11; those of 5 hrs. duration, and 7 March cases most probable to have been unknown light aircraft.

Now to those that are of some interest, the most important is 5 March, at Shaw AFB. Has the verified report come yet? I should like very much to see this. I particularly wonder how the object could have speed 200 mph and still have been observed 1 hour. Very important here to establish identicalness of visual and radar sightings. I am still waiting for the same thing thru Shaw AFB a few hours later refer to the same thing.

With reference to the Craig Falls, Iowa sightings, 3 March, Luke AFB, was the 30 feet of gun camera film ever developed?

Question: Is it permissible to keep the typed copies of the TX reports?

South Carolina Area                                                                   5 March 1953

I.    DESCRIPTION

At 1545 EST, the Assistant Director of Security at the Savannah River Project observed a silver crescent-shaped object visually from the ground for a period of one hour. This object was at a very high altitude, and very little information was obtained through interrogation of the observer.

A Detachment of the 727th ACGW Squadron at Congaree, South Carolina, was notified as a result of the above visual sighting. They picked up an unidentified blip on their AN/TPS-1b type radar at 1707 EST that was approximately 65 miles southwest of Congaree over the Savannah River Project. The Air National Guard was notified with the result that an F-51 type aircraft was airborne within five minutes. The aircraft attempted intercept was 1725 EST when the blip faded northwest of Congaree. The F-51 returned to its base.

At 1752 EST another detachment of the 727th ACGW Squadron at Camden, South Carolina picked up a blip on their AN/TPS-1b type radar. At that time an F-20 type aircraft was scrambled to attempt interception. This unidentified blip was first observed to be approximately 100 miles west, and to the east, the operator had to do an identification turn. This proved that he did not have the F-20 in scope. When the object was first observed, it was approximately 100 miles west, and was 85 miles out heading in a northwest direction, then headed east, then west, and again to the east, fading at 115 miles and 8 degrees from Camden. For a total of 66 minutes, during both radar sightings, aircraft attempted to intercept the unidentified with negative results. At all times, the object stayed at an estimated 20,000 feet altitude, and was doing 200-220 mph.

II.   DISCUSSION

A check was made to determine if there were any aircraft in the vicinity with negative results. There is a time lapse between all three sightings (ground visual) as the Savannah River Project sighting was 22 minutes, and from the Congaree sighting to the Camden sighting was 27 minutes), causing some doubt as to whether the three sightings were connected with the same object. There was really not enough information contained in the report concerning the sighting at the Savannah River Project. For the observer to see an object for that long a period, it would have to be traveling at a very slow rate of speed and at a very high altitude. The radar observers were very well qualified in their fields, and their equipment was in operating condition. The radar returns were similar.

This sighting was sent to the Electronics Branch of ATIC for analysis. This branch, after carefully reviewing the report, concluded it is possibly a flying aircraft.
