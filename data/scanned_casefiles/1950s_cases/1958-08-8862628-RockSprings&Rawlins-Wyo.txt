NR31

WASHINGTON, AUG 4 (UPI)--ASTRONOMERS TODAY TOLD ROCKET-AGE MOON-WATCHERS EARLY TODAY TO GO BACK TO SLEEP -- THAT WAS NOT A ROCKET THEY SAW APPARENTLY HEELED FOR THE MOON.

IT WAS THE PLANET MARS, A NAVAL OBSERVATORY SPOKESMAN SAID.

IN NEW YORK, AN ASTRONOMER FOR THE HAYDEN PLANETARIUM ALSO SAID IT APPEARED THE OBJECT WAS MARS. HE EXPLAINED THAT, IN HIS PRESENT CYCLE, MARS WAS BRIGHTER THAN IN EARLY 1957.

MOREOVER, THE ASTRONOMER, DR. KENNETH FRANKLIN, SAID THE PLANET WOULD BECOME INCREASINGLY BRIGHTER, IN RELATION TO THE MOON, DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, NEAR NEW YORK, HE SAID, ITS BRIGHTNESS WOULD DIMINISH SLOWLY.

THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT HAS DISCLOSED THAT IT PLANS TO TRY TO LAUNCH THE FIRST U.S. LUNAR PROBE "PIONEER" FROM CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., BETWEEN AUG. 17 AND AUG. 20, THOUGH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS MAY DELAY THE FIRING INTO SEPTEMBER. THE RUSSIANS ARE KNOWN TO BE WORKING ON A 1,000-MILE ORBIT OF AND NEAR THE EARTH. THEY ALREADY TRIED ONCE UNSUCCESSFULLY.

LAST NIGHT NEWS AGENCIES AND ASTRONOMERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE PHONED BY EXCITED CITIZENS WHO REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT OBJECT IN SPACE IN THE VICINITY OF THE MOON. SOME REPORTS SAID THE OBJECT WAS HURTLING TOWARD THE MOON.

THOMAS MATTINGLY AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, ASTRONOMER OWEN MATTINGLY TOOK A LOOK TOO.

HE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THE BRIGHT OBJECT, BUT HE SAID IT WAS A BRIGHT STAR OR POSSIBLY A PLANET.

MATTINGLY SAID NO ROCKET FIRED FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON WOULD REMAIN VISIBLE IN SPACE FOR VERY LONG: IT JUST WOULDN'T BE BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE THE BRILLIANCE OF A STAR OR PLANET.

NO COMMENT WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FROM THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY, WHICH TRACKS THE U.S. AND RUSSIAN EARTH SATELLITES.

ALTHOUGH AMATEUR ROCKET-MOGULS REPORTED THEY SAW THE GLOW MOVING TOWARD THE MOON, FRANKLIN SAID THE SITUATION WAS ACTUALLY REVERSED -- THAT IS, THE MOON WAS MOVING TOWARD MARS, FROM THE EARTH.

HOWEVER, HE EXPLAINED, THE PHENOMENON WOULD GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE REVERSE WAS TRUE.

FRANKLIN ATTRIBUTED THE ACUTE INTEREST TO A RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO LAUNCH A LUNAR PROBE ROCKET AND RUSSIA'S AVOWED INTENTION OF TRYING TO SHOOT A ROCKET TO THE MOON.

Flying Saucer
Seen in Akita
AKITA (Kyodo) - A green, black-eyed "flying saucer" was reported here last night.

Two residents of Yuzawa, Akita Prefecture said they saw the luminous object at about 8:30 p.m. One witness said the object was yellow-green and had two black eyes.

She said the circular-shaped object flew across the sky southeast-northwest for about one second.

Report of Unidentified Objects
Sighted in Neighborhood of Bermuda on July 15, 1958
(per U.S.A.F. Headquarters Wire of July 15)

These objects were quite possibly fireballs or meteors (but which would depend on size and brightness which are not described). If they were large objects, they could be fireballs and, while it could remain a remarkable fact that so many fireballs could be seen in such a short space of time (ten in half an hour), it is not outside the bounds of possibility.

Their varied and sometimes opposite directions would, of course, rule out any chance of them being connected with any single normal artificial satellite.

It may be interesting to note that we have three other recent reliable reports of somewhat similar unidentified objects as follows:

Las Cruces, N.M.    July 25    03 27 U.S.
Portland, Oregon    August 1    08 26
Chapa Hill, N.O.    August 1    01 15

Color was not mentioned in the Las Cruces case. The Portland object was almost one-fourth to one-half red and was almost one-fourth of a moon in size. The Chapel Hill object was one-tenth of the moon's diameter and had a large orange tail. All were traveling in a more or less easterly direction.

Also of interest, for whatever the coincidence may be worth, is the fact that two two-intervals between the last Bermuda west-to-east sighting, and the Las Cruces and Portland observations, have a common denominator, or common period, of 345 days (all sightings on or near 211, 345 days apart). This might be purely coincidental, but it is interesting to note the two Portland sightings (the Bermuda and the Portland sightings) are only very approximately alike.

Boom, Balloons Mystify Utah Residents
SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 8
-(A)- A couple of heavenly
happenings jarred and mystified Salt Lake valley residents
First there was an explosion, later identified as a
sonic boom caused by a plane
breaking the sound barrier.

Some observers thought they
saw a missile and two chase
planes in the sky. Newsmen
were told that further information was classified, but that
the military knew of no missiles
over Utah at the time.

Moments later came the balloons—two of them, one leak-

ing an odd-smelling gas. They
floated down from the sky
and landed southeast of Salt
Lake City at Henry Engh, 45,
and his family stood in their
yard discussing the blast noise.

The boom thunderclapped
over some 30 miles of the valley, and many residents ran

outside to see what caused
it. Many reported seeing the
craft overhead—two tiny jets
high in the sky following a
larger, black craft. No damage was reported.

Maj. Gen. Maxwell E. Rich,
Utah's adjutant general, iden-

tified the noise as a sonic boom
but added: "All other information about it is classified."

He said he saw no connection between the boom and the
unmarked balloons. He ordered an Air National Guard

unit to take charge of the
plastic objects and try to
identify them.

Other operational missile units in the
Southern California and New
Mexico—as well as the Defense Department in Washington—said there was no missile firing yesterday.

The balloons were not identified immediately. The weather balloons are
their: Weather balloons are
filled with helium or hydrogen,
a spokesman said, neither of
which has an odor.

As for the boom, the Strategic Air Command headquarters at Omaha said it had no

The balloons, of clear plastic,
were about four feet long and
18 inches in diameter. They
carried no markings and had a blue paper-like material, somewhat like rice paper, between them. They carried no markings or instruments.

ORGANS, MISC. - SOURCE: SHEET REVIEW - SGT / NOTES 8 Aug 1958
Buenos Aires

NO CASE(INFORMATION ONLY)

We will begin by giving the testimony (as communicated) by Mr. Cristian Vogt of an official of the Provincial Senate at the Province of Buenos Aires, in the Argentine Republic who was driving his 1948 Ford car along the road between Usme and Bolivar on August 8, 1958, when his engine suddenly stalled. His dashboard clock stopped, showing 1:27 a.m. The witness got out his final cause of the breakdown, cleaned the distributor leads, and then tried to get the car going again, but in vain. Only then did he notice, at a distance of 300 or 400 metres, what seemed to be a machine which was approaching relatively slowly, and close to the ground. Thereupon put his lights off. The phenomenon observed by him was not completely symmetrical, as the witness speaks of a flatness of the "machine", a certain phosphorescence was given off from the thing. The phenomenon was accompanied by a soft whirring, like the noise of a fan varying according to its movement. The witness describes this "machine" as having a cupola or cupid that emitted a blinding flash. Finally, the thing rose, at a "staggering speed", towards the south, giving off whistling noises. Returning to his car, the witness found that the needle on his oil gauge had gone "crazy", but that he was able to start the engine again.

'Flying Saucers' Formed Cluster, Observers Say

Alamogordo, N.M. (UP) - A group of unidentified flying objects "clustered like a star" hovered for more than an hour near here Friday night and then suddenly "broke apart" and disappeared," witnesses said yesterday.

A spokesman for the Aerial Research Phenomena Organization filter center here said a total of nine persons had reported seeing the mysterious objects.

A check of nearly military bases, airports and the United States Weather Bureau disclosed there were no jets or weather balloons aloft at or near the time of the sightings, between 10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. filter center director L. J. Lorenzen said.

An employee of the Alamogordo school system, Isaac Car, told the filter center, "I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself."

Millions of Galaxies

Life in Space?

As we reach out further and further into space, with bigger and bigger telescopes, more and more galaxies come into view. Some, like the one Andromedis, have a spiral structure. Like a huge pinwheel. Others are shaped like a flat lens, and show few details of structure. A mind class shown in irregular shape with an particular form.

The size of the components of our universe: millions and millions of galaxies, each containing millions of even billions of stars.

A good proportion of these stars are probably accompanied by planets like those around the sun. Many of these planets may well be inhabited. It may longer seem that our earthly life is unique - or nearly so.

I want to write why I am writing you but have read some article, that seems and feel I should write to you about my sighting of a UFO.

This was one night of average in length, between 9:30 PM with a clear sky. I saw this object again, and steadily moving in the southern sky from west to east. Later it was at about a 45° angle with me at about a 45° angle south and was silent.

I thought it to be something similar to a satellite and would like to know if it was 15 - 20 degrees above the horizon - is from (15 sec) and was of my sighting.

INFORMATION, W. METEOR REPORTS FROM OCEAN NEAR AT THIS PARTICULAR D.T.G.

August 7, 1958.

Portland, Oregon    August 1    08 26

Color was not mentioned in the Las Cruces case. The Portland object charged from white to red and was almost one-fourth of the moon in size. The Chapel Hill object was one-tenth of the moon's diameter and had a large orange tail. All were travelling in a more or less easterly direction.

Also of interest, for whatever the coincidence may be worth, is the fact that the two time intervals between the last Bermuda west-to-east sighting, and the Las Cruces and Portland observations, have a common denominator, or common basic period, of about 5.5 minutes. The Chapel Hill sighting can also be included in this time grouping (115 minutes, as the common basic period for all these intervals, approximately).

(N.B. The Portland sighting time is only very approximate).
