1. The attached report, together with photographs, are forwarded for your information. These photographs were analysed by two photographic analysts at this Command and discussed with an astronomer.

2. It was concluded that the object which can be seen in the sky on these photographs is the moon, the unusual shape being caused by the movement of the moon, during the time exposure (probably five to ten minutes). The variation in brilliance along the image probably was caused by clouds dimming the moon during portions of the time.

3. A new moon came up on 18 March 1950. On 20 March 1950, at the time of the evening indicated (1720 and 1830 hours), a sharply defined crescent would be the only portion of the moon illuminated. This further confirms the above conclusion.

4. In addition, a close look at the photograph (see lower right hand corner) shows a streak of light which is typical of that caused by a moving ground vehicle on a time exposed photograph.

5. No further action on this incident is contemplated by this Command.

SUBJECT: UNDERHILL STUDIO

New York 7, New York
SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

1. On 2 December 1950, this office received a letter from [redacted] Studio, photographers, New York 7, N. Y., which contained an inquiry concerning the identity of an object discovered on a photographic print. The letter, signed by [redacted], Manager, advised that the picture had been taken 20 May 1950 (later determined to be 20 March 1950), but that the negative had just recently been printed.

2. On 4 December 1950, Special Agent JOHN H. SMITH, this office, interviewed Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted], owner of the Underhill Studio. In a joint interview, the following information was obtained:

The photograph, a night view of Manhattan, was taken on 20 March 1950 (not on 20 May 1950 as stated in letter PFUWR dated 1 December 1950) at some time between 1730 and 1800 hours. Photograph was taken by [redacted] looking south-east from a pedestrian walk near the Queens side of the Queensboro Bridge. The Queensboro Bridge extends across the East River and Welfare Island, from East 59th Street in Manhattan Forugh of New York City, to Queens Boulevard in Queens Borough of New York City. Photograph was taken with an Eklo view camera with medium lens, but [redacted] was not sure if he used an instantaneous shutter or a Cap (Time) Exposure. Another photograph taken immediately prior to the one in question did not reveal any object such as shown on the print in question. The photograph titled "Night Lights from Queensboro Bridge" was taken for use as a postcard view, requested by and delivered to Mr. [redacted] of the Heivert E. Covert Greeting Cards Company, [redacted] Street, New York, N. Y.
