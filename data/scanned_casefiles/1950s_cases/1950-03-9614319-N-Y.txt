1. The attached report, together with photographs, are forwarded for your information. These photographs were analyzed by two photo-graphic analysts at this Command and discussed with an astronomer.

2. It was concluded that the object which can be seen in the sky on the photographs is the unusually bright twin stars being obscured by the moon, the variations in brilliance along the image are probably caused by clouds dimming the moon obscuring portions of the image.

3. A new moon came up on 18 March 1950. On 20 March 1950, at the time of the evening sighting (1720 and 1930 hours), it sharply defined the edge should be the portion of the moon illuminated. This further confirms the above conclusion.

4. In addition, a close look at the photograph (see lower right hand corner) shows a streak of light which is typical of that caused by a moving ground vehicle on a long exposure photograph.

5. No further action on this incident is contemplated by this Command.

The attached report, together with photographs, are forwarded for your information. These photographs were analyzed by two photographic analysts at this Command and discussed with an astronomer.

1. It was concluded that the object which can be seen in the sky on these photographs is the moon, the unusual shape being caused by the movement (possibly five to ten minutes). The variation in brilliance along the image probably was caused by clouds dimming the moon during portions of the time.

2. A new moon came up on 15 March 1950. On 20 March 1950, at the time of the sighting (about 1830 hours), a sharply defined crescent would be the only portion of the moon illuminated. This further confirms the above conclusion.

3. In addition, a close look at the photograph (see lower right hand corner) shows a streak of light which is typical of that caused by a moving ground vehicle on a long exposure photograph.

No further action on this incident is contemplated by this Command.

The image appears to contain a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is addressed to the "Director of Special Investigations, Headquarters United States Air Force" in Washington, D.C.

The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

THE INSPECTOR GENERAL USAF
3D DISTRICT OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS
67 BROAD STREET
NEW YORK 4, NEW YORK

IN REPLY
REFER TO: 24-178

SUBJECT: UNDERHILT STUDIO
17 PARK PLACE
NEW YORK 7, NEW YORK
SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. On 2 December 1950, this office received a letter from UNDERHILT STUDIO, 17 Park Place, New York, which contained an inquiry concerning the identity of an object discovered on a photograph. The letter stated that the picture had been taken on 20 May 1950 (later determined to be 20 May 1950) but this date was recently printed.

2. On 4 December 1950, Special Agent JOHN H. SMITH of this office, interviewed Mr. UNDERHILT of the UNDERHILT Studio. In a joint interview, the following information was obtained:

The photograph, a night view of Manhattan, was taken on 20 May 1950 (not on 20 May 1950 as stated in letter) from the roof of the UNDERHILT STUDIO building. At some time between 1950 and 1953, when the photograph was being processed, an unidentified object appeared in the sky near the Queensboro Bridge and Welfare Island, from East 59th Street in Manhattan. The photograph was taken with an Exito view camera. Another photograph taken immediately prior to the one in question did not reveal such an object.

The photograph titled "MIGHT LIGHTS" from Queens-boro Bridge view, requested by and delivered to Mr. Coventry E. Covert of the Herbert F. Covert Company, New York, N.Y. was later downgraded at a year interval, declassified at their 12 years.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing only text and redacted information.

Lt. 20 Oct. file 24-178, subject Studio, to FQ CSI, dtd 8 Dec 50.

advised he believed that the object on the photograph was crashed out prior to delivery to fire

He stated that he did not notice any object in the photograph, but that he does not believe that the object is a film or lens defect.

He stated that he intended to send the photograph to the Air Force some months ago, but became so busy that he had forgotten about it until a recent date. 

3. Inclosed for your information are copies, in duplicate, of the letter from Underbill Studio, a print of the original photograph and an enlargement of a portion thereof. No further investigative activity is contemplated by this office unless requested by your Headquarters.
