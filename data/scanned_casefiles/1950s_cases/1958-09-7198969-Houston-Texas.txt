SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. On 29 September 1958, Ellington Air Force Base received a report from Doctor from Houston, Texas, that he had sighted an unfamiliar airborne object. Listed below is pertinent data relating to this observation in accordance with paragraph 15, AFR 200-2.

a. Description of the object:

(1) Shape: round with a fan shaped tail.
(2) Size: described the object as slightly smaller than a full moon but larger than any star or planet.
(3) Color: bright orange.
(4) Number: one (1).
(5) Sound: stated that no sound emitted from the object.
(6) No other pertinent or unusual features were noted.

b. Description of course of object:

(1) stated that he had gone to his back yard to feed his dogs. He stated that the object was so large and unusual that he was instantly aware of its presence in the sky.

(2) used a small compass to plot the object's azimuth and estimated its angle of elevation. The first sighting was at an angle of 35° on an azimuth of 030°. Angle of elevation 15 - 20 degrees at disappearance on an azimuth of 240°.

(3) Flight path was a continuous, straight flight path from northeast to southwest. No maneuvers were observed. Object was visible continuously.

(4) The object passed out of visual range to the southwest.

(5) stated that the object was visible for approximately fifteen (15) minutes.

c. Manner of observation:
Observation was ground visual with the aid of ten power binoculars.

d. Time and date of sighting:
(1) Period of observation was 0245Z to 0300Z, 29 September 1958.
(2) Light conditions: night.

e. Location of observer: 95° 25'W29° 42'N (southwest side of Houston, Texas).

f. Reported by: Houston, Texas; telephone. Also observed by same address.

g. Weather and winds aloft conditions at time and place of sighting:
(1) stated that a high stratus condition existed at time of observation.
(2) Wind direction and velocity at surface: 050°/4K; 6,000' 060° 10K; 10,000' 270° 10K; 16,000' 250° 15K; 20,000' 230° 20K; 30,000' 260° 30K; 50,000' 270° 40K.

(3) Ellington Air Force Base weather at 0221Z was: estimated 8,000 feet broken, 10,000 feet broken, high overcast.

(4) Visibility: twelve (12) miles.
(5) Broken to overcast cloud cover.
(6) No thunderstorms reported.

h. No interception or identification action taken.

i. No air traffic was reported in the area at the time of the sighting.

1. No photographic or physical evidence exists.

2. The Base Operations Officer prepared this report. He talked with both and by telephone. Both individuals seemed to be intelligent, observant people with a better than average grasp of weather conditions and the visual impressions created by aircraft in flight at night. Displayed good sense in using a compass and binoculars to determine the objects azimuth, elevation and identity. He recorded his findings and has them in his possession.

3. A telephonic check with the Houston Post's news staff, the Houston Chronicle's news staff, the Houston Police Department, Civil Aeronautics Administration, and the Houston Tower did not reveal any other reported observers. The 747th AC&W Squadron radar and the Houston Approach Control radar did not observe any unusual traffic during the period of Doctor Jansa's observation.

4. The flight path of the object closely approximates the route of V-18 and V-20 southwest. The speed and altitude of the object closely approximates that of conventional aircraft. The lighting, however, was completely unorthodox. It is the opinion of the reporting officer that the object was a fuselage, or similar light, on the underside of a conventional aircraft, probably a civil aircraft.
