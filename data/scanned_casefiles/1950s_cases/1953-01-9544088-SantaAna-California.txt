CASE #21 (contd - page 4)
9 Jan 53                                     Santa Ana, California

Two observers, an a/c commander and a pilot of B-29 air-wrecking a/c, first observed the object while flying on a heading of 330 deg. The objects appeared as a formation of lights approaching the a/c from a NE direction. The lights approached the a/c with such a rapid rate of closure that the a/c commander started a turn to the left, suddenly the lights and appeared to hold the same position momentarily and then made a slight rise and disappeared. The lights appeared in a slightly bent V formation and were blue in color. During the interval in which they were observed, the lights changed from a banked to a level position, stopped and banked very immediately before disappearing. No sound was heard. The time of the sighting was 1927 PST with the lights remaining in view for approximately 5 seconds thereafter. The a/c in which they were flying was on a heading of 330 deg and was over Santa Ana, California. The objects were observed at 230 o'clock or 112 of the a/c. These objects appeared to be on a plane 1,000 with the a/c which was flying at 15,500'. The speed of the objects or their distance from the observers could not be ascertained. The weather conditions at the time of sighting were clear sky, the radar while for the position were 227 deg at 12 knots. The a/c commander upon first sighting initiated a left turn in an effort to get out of the line of flight of the objects. As both were familiar with the reflection characteristics of the B-29 cockpit, these were checked to insure the lights were not a ground reflection within the cockpit. There were no other a/c observed in the immediate vicinity and none were reported by Air Traffic Control and Military Flight Service.

ATIC Comments: Two KC-97 type a/c over Santa Ana at time of sighting and other a/c were in the immediate vicinity and 1 particular a/c was equipped with a number of blue light formation lights and the object was definitely that a/c.

1. Description of Object: The observers, Aircraft Commander and pilot of a B-29 aircraft, first observed the objects while flying on a bombing mission over Korea. Two objects appeared as a formation of lights approaching the aircraft from a northeasterly direction. The objects, now some 20 miles away, were of circular shape and colors of orange and disappeared. The lights appeared in a slightly bent V formation and were blue in color. Later, the same crew again observed the objects near Okinawa, Japan, at a level position, stopped, and moved almost immediately before disappearing. No sound was heard.

2. Time of Observation: Observation was at about 1027 hrs, with the lights remaining in view for approximately five (5) seconds characteristic.

3. Manner of Observation: Observation was made visually from the cockpit of an aircraft B-29 type, aircraft; no optical or electronic equipment was utilized. Initial observation was drawn by sight only as these objects appeared as blue-white. Aircraft Commander and co-pilot were the only crew members to view the objects.

4. Location: The observers were airborne at the time of the sighting. The site was over North Korea (approx. 35N-125E) at an altitude of 20,000 feet. The objects were observed at 2120 o'clock or approximately 20 miles from the aircraft, when seen flying at an altitude of 16,000 feet. The speed of the objects or their distance from the observers could not be ascertained.

5. Observers:
a. 1st Lt. LESLIE D. BRANDT, USAF, Aircraft Commander (B-29) assigned to a combat crew of the 9th Air Refueling Squadron, 93d Bombardment Wing (L), Castle Air Force Base, California. In the past three and one half years, further, he has not previously observed unidentified objects.

b. 1st Lt. CHARLES E. LEWIS, USAF, co-pilot (B-29) on the same combat crew as Lt. Brandt. Lt. Lewis has been on flying status for two and one half years and has been assigned to the 93d Air Refueling Squadron, 9th Bombardment Wing (L), Castle AFB, Force Base, California. For three months. He reports that this is the first time he has seen unidentified objects.

6. Weather Conditions: Clear skies—the radar winds for the position were 267 degrees at 15 knots.

7. Aerial Activities or Conditions: None Determined.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Immediate Interpretation or Identification Action: The report received from the first aircraft initial contact was the first indication of the objects. As both pilots were familiar with the reflection characteristics of the cockpit, those extra precautions were taken to insure the report was not a ground reflection. The Los Angeles, California CAA radio was called and informed as to the location, and altitude.

10. Miscellaneous Air Traffic: There were no other aircraft observed in the immediate vicinity and none were reported by Air Traffic Control and Intercept Services.

STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

At 1927 (Pacific Standard Time), 9 January 1953 over the city of Santa Ana, California, on a heading of 330° my co-pilot, Lt. Charles C. Loveless, called my attention to a formation of lights approaching the aircraft from a position of 02:30 o'clock level. The lights approached at a very rapid rate of closure and I immediately effected a turn to the left. The lights stopped and appeared to hold the same position momentarily and then made a slight rise and disappeared. The total time of sighting was approximately 5 seconds. I immediately called Los Angeles radio and informed them of time, altitude and position of the objects.

The weather was clear in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. As both pilots were familiar with the reflection characteristics of the B-29 cockpit, these were checked to insure it was not a ground reflection within the cockpit. There was no aircraft in the immediate vicinity and none was reported by Air Traffic Control and Military Flight Services. The lights seemed to appear in a slightly bent V formation and were blue in color. The formation appeared to change from a bank to a level position then stopped and banked away just before disappearing. The radar winds for the position were 227°/12 knots. My co-pilot and myself were the only members of the crew to view the lights. Our altitude was 16,500 feet.

I further state that I am an Aircraft Commander (12346) assigned to a combat crew of the 93d Air Refueling Squadron, 93d Bomb Wing (C), Castle AFB, California. I have been on flying status 3½ years. I enclose a drawing of the appearance of the objects.

4 JAN 1953
SANTA ANA CALIF

The new sightings looked important. The first report was dated January 9, 1953. Early that evening, a B-29 bomber, with Capt. George Madden at the controls, was flying over California on a routine mission. Lt. Frank Briggs, the co-pilot, had the flight-hand seat. (As in all these official cases, witnesses* names have been changed.)

It was a clear night. They could see Santa Ana, some 16,000 feet below. Except for the B-29, the sky seemed to be empty. Captain Madden was checking his instruments when a flash of blue suddenly caught Briggs' eye. He stared out to the right. Coming toward them, at fantastic speed, was a V-formation of blue-lighted objects.

Briggs gave a shout of warning. Madden took one look, hurriedly swerved to the left. For a split second, the strange craft seemed to hold their speed. Then they abruptly slowed down, the V-formation twisting as if a few of the machines had overshot. Banking away, they slanted upward and vanished.

Though Madden knew of no supersonic test plane that could make such speed, he put in his mike and called air-traffic control. The answer came back: No experiment mental aircraft—no planes of any kind—were known to be in the area.
