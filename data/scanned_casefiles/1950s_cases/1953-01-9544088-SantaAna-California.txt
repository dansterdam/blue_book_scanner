CASE #21 (round - page 4)  
9 Jan 53  
Santa Ana, California  

Two observers, an a/c commander and a pilot of a B-29 aircraft, observed the objects while flying at a heading of 320 deg. The objects appeared as a formation resembling the lights formation of jets, with lights appearing at regular intervals. The lights seemed to be oscillating somewhat and disappeared and reappeared at intervals. There was a brief rate of closeness that the a/c commander started a turn to the left, suddenly the lights and appeared to hold the same position momentarily and then made a slight rise and disappeared. The lights appeared in a slightly bright V formation and were blue in color. During the interval in which they were observed, the lights changed from a banked to a level position, stopped and started only momentarily before disappearing. The time on board was 1937-1942 with the time remaining in view for approximately 5 seconds thereafter. The a/c in which they were flying was on a heading of 320 deg and was over Santa Ana, California. The objects were observed at 23:00 or 23:15 of the a/c. These objects appeared to be at a level with the a/c which was flying at 35,500'. The speed of the objects or their distance from the observer could not be ascertained. The weather conditions at the time precluded any positive identification. In most cases the a/c commander upon first sighting initiated a turn in an effort to get out of the line of flight of the objects. As both were familiar with the reflection characteristics of the B-29 cockpit, there were checked to insure the lights were not a ground reflection within the cockpit. There were no other a/c observed in the immediate vicinity and those were reported by air traffic control and identified as friendly aircraft Service.

UNCLASSIFIED
EXHIBIT NO. IDS SUPPLEMENT SHEET

This report is supplementary to the report of the investigation of an unidentified flying object sighted over Santa Ana, California on 10 January 1953.

The principal observer, who was the pilot of a United States Air Force F-86 fighter aircraft, submitted a detailed written report describing his sighting of an unidentified object which he observed at close range for approximately five (5) minutes. The object was described as being metallic in appearance, oval in shape, and approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter. It emitted no sound and did not display any means of propulsion. The object was observed to execute rapid maneuvers and changes in altitude which the pilot stated could not have been accomplished by any known type of conventional aircraft. The pilot's report has been carefully corroborated by other observers on the ground.

It should be noted that this supplementary report contains additional details and observations which were not included in the original report. These are set forth below:

1. LOCATION: The sighting occurred approximately 5 miles southwest of Santa Ana, California, at an estimated altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet.

2. TIME: The object was first observed at approximately 12:07 p.m. (PST) and was kept under observation for approximately five (5) minutes.

3. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: The object was described as being metallic in appearance, oval in shape, and approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter. It emitted no sound and did not display any means of propulsion.

4. MANEUVERS: The object was observed to execute rapid maneuvers and changes in altitude which the pilot stated could not have been accomplished by any known type of conventional aircraft.

5. WITNESSES: In addition to the pilot, the object was observed by two other United States Air Force personnel who were on the ground at the time of the sighting.

6. WEATHER CONDITIONS: The weather at the time of the sighting was clear with good visibility.

7. INVESTIGATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The sighting has been thoroughly investigated by appropriate United States Air Force personnel. All available evidence has been carefully analyzed and evaluated. Based on this investigation, it is the conclusion of the United States Air Force that the object observed was an unidentified flying object, the nature and origin of which could not be determined.

AT 1927 (Pacific Standard Time), 9 JANUARY 1953 over the city of Santa Ana, California, on a heading of 330Â° by co-pilot, i.e. Charles G. Loveless, called my attention to a formation of lights approaching the aircraft from a position of 63:30 o'clock level. The lights approached at a very rapid rate of closure and I immediately effected a turn to the left. The lights stopped and appeared to make a position maneuver at close range and then made a slight rise and disappeared. The total time of sighting was approximately 5 seconds. I immediately called Los Angeles radio and informed them of time, altitude and position of the objects. The weather was clear in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. As both pilots were familiar with the reflection characteristics of the B-29 aircraft, it was apparent the objects were checked to be ground reflections. There was no aircraft in the immediate vicinity and none was reported by Air Traffic Control and Military Flight Services. The lights seemed to appear in a slightly bent V formation and were blue in color. The formation appeared to change from a bank to a level position then stopped and sank away just before disappearance. The pilot and myself were the only members of the crew to view the lights. Our altitude was 15,500 feet. 

I further state that I am an Aircraft Commander (12343) assigned to a combat crew of the 53d Air Refueling Squadron, 53d Bomb Wing (M), Castle AFB, California. I have been on flying status for 7 years. I enclose a drawing of the appearance of the sighting.

Text from the document:

I have consulted with Lt. Colonel in the preparation of his statement in connection with sighting flying objects (lights) on 9 January 1953, over Santa Ana, California. As a result of this consultation I feel his statement is complete and accurate and I can therefore add nothing to that account.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"The new sightings looked important. The first report was dated January 8, 1953. Early that morning, a B-29 bomber, with Capt. George Mandlin at the controls, was flying over California on a routine mission. Lt. Frank Bridges, the copilot, had the sight-land to the east. (As in all these official cases, witnesses' names have been changed.) It was a clear night. They could see Santa Ana, some 10,000 feet below, for the 12-20 miles. Suddenly, a bright light appeared 4 to 5 times the size of the B-29, moving rapidly over the area. Mandlin and Bridges watched it maneuver, make a fast run, and then return at fantastic speed, to a point near the B-29. Mandlin took one look, hurriedly averted to the left. For a split second, the strange craft seemed to hold their speed. Then they suddenly showed down, the motion twisting as if a few of the machines had overshot. Banking away, they slanted upward and vanished.

Though Maddin knew of no superior craft that could make such speed, the answer came back: No experimental aircraft-no planes of any kind were known to be in the area."
