There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be a description or report.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

A 7'43" circle; description, approximate

previously seen. The intensity of the object
vas rather low, but clear. It gave
[lasing effect, with the center
bright, the edge dimmer. It went
on for about 15 seconds. (Clippings on

The image does not contain any photographs. However, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
REPORT NO.
14547 FIGHTER GROUP (AFR-1542(38))
(a) Time and date of sighting
(a) 27/3/1957
(b) Light condition - Night
(c) Location of observers: Littleton, New Hampshire. The observation was made between the Littleton Dam and the town proper, at a point where the new highway 
comes down to the lake.
(d) Identifying information of all observers
(e) Civilian
1. Dr. Roy H. Hailing Address: , Vt.
2. Dr. Warrington, Vermont - Mailing Address: 
(f) Military - Negative
(7) (a) Observers account of weather conditions - Undetermined; however, fact 
it was perfectly clear.
(b) Report from Department of 198th weather squadron, Burlington, Vermont:
Indicates atmospheric disturbance and clouds scurrying and drifting northerly at 8:30. Gusts to 30, 28' to 30' at 30, 18' at 40, 18' at 45. Wind 230' at 20.
(c) Ceiling - Variable, scattered to broken. 
(d) Visibility - 10 miles+
(e) Amount of cloud cover - 4 to 6 tenths
(f) Negative
(8) No continuous activity or conditions known which might account for the sighting.
(9) Interruption or identification action taken - None. The report was not
received until 10 days after the sighting.
(10) The witness reported no visible air traffic in the area at the time of
sighting. There was no similarity of any traffic in the area.
(11) This report prepared by the Operations Staff Officer, 14th Fighter Group
USAF. It should be noted that this USAF report holds some validity, since one of the reporting witnesses was a military officer. The case is rated as UNIDENTIFIED, probable celestial phenomenon, being a very bright stationary light, similar to the Littleton sighting last week with a local police official. If this was a celestial phenomenon, then it was no closer or higher than the reported 1600' to 2200' altitude. There is, however, no indication in the report of any associated effects, such as maneuvering, color changes, sound, or vapor trails observed, and this was no time from an aircraft because it was perfectly stationary. With this in mind, the case is considered UNIDENTIFIED.
