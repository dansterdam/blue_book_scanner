1. Request that the attached radar reports, together with
scope plots and photographs be reviewed and an
analysis be made by Comment attached in separate sheets.

2. Radar UFO report on TT Mcs carries a "Priority"
classification. The sheet (plots and photos) has resulted in
queries from Hqtrs. USAF regarding our findings.

3. With regard to the latter we point -- carrying plot indicates
that the UFO's blips appeared within a 10-3 miles
yoft off the radar unit intermittently for three hours,
which if appears that no attempt was made to visually
identify, or check on the source of sign R.

4. This office should like to bring to your attention,
according to our previous points which may or
are now being submitted. These will be having number
a screening and uncontrolled investigation by this office.

5. In accordance with our request made in our previous
filed that all possible data together with scope photos
should be submitted with single reports, we are
conclusively made. Incl. reports if successfully
that this is being complied with.

1.  Reference is made to subject report submitted from Whiteman AFB, Missouri.

2.  The information submitted, while voluminous, does not include a great deal
of data which would be required to a thorough analysis of the report. The speeds,
as determined from the charts, are all speeds so low as to indicate a ground target,
rather than an airborne target. The fact that the greatest activity took place
within 3 miles of the runway, (much of it within 1 mile) at about 1200 with no visual
sighting indicates spurious response of some kind.

3.  It is realized that the information submitted herein is of little comfort
to personnel who have seen such returns on their radars. For this reason efforts
are being made to secure a competent consultant on these matters who will be able
to provide a more positive approach to this subject than is currently possible.

1. Reference message this Headquarters, DOI-750, dated 7 November 1957.

2. Attached are six diagrams depicting the tracks of UFOBs.
The diagrams were prepared as it was noted while observing the UFOBs
on the search radar that the initial inbound tracks appeared to home
in on the radar transmitters. The targets would change direction
when they were within one (1) to two (2) miles of the radar transmitters. It should also be noted that there was no set pattern in
regards to the direction the targets were moving.

3. When on the radar scope, the UFOBs were easy to recognize
and track as they gave a good clear return that was as large and
bright as a B-47 target. A UFOB and B-47 (B-47 was in a holding
pattern on the radio beacon) were on the scope at the same time and
thus it was possible to compare their radar returns. One difference
was noted between the UFOBs and B-47 targets, the UFOBs were round
and were not distorted by the radar sweep while the B-47 targets gave
an elongated appearance on the search radar scope. On the precision
radar, the UFOBs gave a return that appeared the same as an aircraft.

4. As plotted on inclosures #1 thru 6, it appears that the
UFOBs made sharp turns or changes in direction. However, their
turns were gradual when visually observed on the radar scope and
turns could be noted primarily by plotting the target bearings from
the station.

5. Radar Photographs:
a. Inclosure #7 is a photograph of UFOB crossing the
precision scope from left to right (west to east) at 1832L 6 November
1957. (Ref incl #3 for diagram of target tracked from 1829L to 1844L
6 November 1957). The photograph is of poor quality as the camera
was hand held and the face of the radar scope was not removed. The
photograph was taken with color film, F-2 at one-fourth second. At
the time this photograph was taken, the UFOB target was comparable
to the return of a B-47 aircraft and was tracked on both the azimuth
and elevation sectors of the precision scope.

1. Except for the rather slow speeds reported, there is little of the unusual in these reported sightings. The fact that no intercepts were attempted, and also that no reference is made to visual observation or observation by other radar in the area make it impossible to determine with any degree of certainty whether the targets observed were true or false.

1. Reference message this Headquarters, DOI-750, dated 7 November 1957.

2. Attached are six diagrams depicting the tracks of UFO's. The diagrams were prepared as it was noted while observing the UFO's on the search radar that the initial blush nicely appeared to home in on the radar transmitters. The targets would change direction when they were within one (1) to two (2) miles of the radar transmitters. It could also be noted that there was no set pattern in previous to the rotation of the targets were.

3. More on the radar scope, the UFO's were easy to recognize and tracks as they gave a good clean, bright and distinct as a B-17 target. A UFO and B-17 (-B-17 was in a holding pattern on the radio beacon) were in the same area at the same time in this 10 to 10 compare their radar returns. One difference was noted between the UFO's and B-17 targets, the UFO's were round and were not distorted by the radar sweep while the B-17 targets gave an elongated return. In the same case, the 500's gave a return that appeared the same as an aircraft.

4. Plotted on Inclosure #1 thru 6, it appears that the UFO's while turning showed no changes in direction. However, their turns were radical when visually observed on the radar scope and the turns could be read readily by plotting the target's course from the exterior.

5. Radar Photomontage:

a. Inclosure #7 is a photograph of UFO crossing the precision scope. (on the left to right (west to east) at 1803.6 November 1957. (ref incl 3 for diagram of target tracked from 18:9L to 18:30L 6 November 1957). The photograph is of poor quality as the camera was hand held and the face of the camera scope was not removed. The photograph was taken with color film, 2-2 at one-fourth second. At the time this photograph was taken, the UFO target was comparable to the return of a B-17 aircraft and was tracked on both the azimuth and elevation scopes.

DOI, SUBJ: (U) Unidentified Flying Objects

be Inclosure #9,9 and 10 are photographs taken in sequence of an UFOB on the search radar. These photographs were taken on a tripod held C-6 Speed Graphic camera with black and white film at approximately one (1) minute intervals. The time element is an estimate as the exact time intervals were not recorded. Mid target was of short duration and was not reported in the message or reflected on attached diagrams (Inclosures 1-6).
