The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project 10073 record card from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

2. LOCATION: New York City, New York
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: 1) Ground-Radar, 2) Air-Visual, 3) Air-Intercept Radar
5. DURATION: Fifty minutes
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Fifty minutes
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The objects were seen moving across the sky in an easterly direction, after which they returned to their original position and seemed to stop and hover. The sightings lasted about fifty minutes.
11. COMMENTS: Several 164 were sent to the sources and the analysis of the forms indicated that the sightings were probably satellites. The initial report indicated that these sightings might represent evidence supporting this, and further investigation was not considered necessary.
