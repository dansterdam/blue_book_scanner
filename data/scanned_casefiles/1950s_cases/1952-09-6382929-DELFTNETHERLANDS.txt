AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Area, The Hague, Netherlands                IR-62-52                PAGE 2 OF 3

Following is a letter from Ms. Radio Engineer, employed by the Netherlands Cable Factory, Delft, dated 8 September 1952:

"This letter comes to you from Delft, the industrial town between Rotterdam and The Hague in the Netherlands. The Dutch Cable works are situated in this town and I am working in the Physical Laboratory of this factory.

Last week I was making tests on a V.H.F. antenna which is constructed on top of the roof. (See picture No. 1). This antenna is a 20 meter reflection, frequency 119.3 Mc/ss

Before this I got the maximum reading of my indication instrument and I took a certain moment to verify this reading with my assistant. (See picture No. 2).

Thereafter I asked him to go downstairs to get a soldering iron. I went on making tests and at his 15 C.E.S.T. (3:15 G.M.T.) I loaded the camera to make another picture of the indicator and then I suddenly saw a bright silver light, looking like a silver V2 rocket. (We had a rocket launcher just a few miles from our home during the war). There was no sound to hear but then flying came closer, it turned towards me and looked like a bright silver round plate. I thought it might be a flying saucer. As I still hold my camera I only pushed the shutter (1/250 sec) without looking in the view finder because there was no time to lose. Then I looked at the field antenna mast and I noticed a strong dip in the meter deflection of the indicating instrument. The saucer disappeared with a tremendous speed perpendicular to the earth surface. (Time 15:35 C.E.S.T., 3:35 G.M.T.)

I immediately rushed to the Photographic Laboratory where I and the experts were very excited about this photo. At home I phoned "Telegraaf" one of the leading newspapers in the Netherlands and the editor and I went to the Meteorological Institute in the Bilt (near Utrecht). The experts were very excited about this photo. They thought the bright corona around the saucer could be due to ultra violet rays and furthermore deformation because the lens of my camera was fully opened without using the diaphragm. (I had no time to lose. I only tried to make a photo in the shortest possible time)."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Airf, The Hague, Netherlands                   TR-62-52                       PAGE    3    of    3    PAGES

Following is a translation of an article which appeared in the newspaper "Nieuws van
de Dag":

STRANGE PHENOMENON PHOTOGRAPHED

[Partially illegible text follows, but the key points are:]

...and at the same time our country has at last his flying saucer! Whimsically as a young woman the enigmatic phenomenon has, for a few seconds, frolicked in the sky of industrious... and would have disappeared again, unnoticed in the haze or the ether if a young man had not been able to arrest it in its orbit.

[Rest of the text describes a photographic incident involving a radio mechanic who captured an unusual light phenomenon with a camera, with details about the observation at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]

Key sections discuss:
- A bright light moving from south to east
- "Kind of Rocket"
- Detailed description of the photographic event
- Discussions with scientists about the phenomenon
- Speculation about optical illusions and magnetic influences

The document is marked UNCLASSIFIED at the top and bottom.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

"Flying Saucer"

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing an industrial or urban landscape with several smokestacks or chimneys in the background, and a large white circular object (labeled as a "Flying Saucer") positioned in the sky to the right side of the image.
