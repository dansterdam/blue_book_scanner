Based on the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the text in the document, the output is as follows:

Between 8:30 and 8:50 on 30 March 1950, an unidentified "flying" object was observed by three observers at a stockyard in Sioux City, Iowa.

The observers, who were stockyard employees, watched the object through field glasses for 15-20 minutes. The object appeared to be silver in color, about the size of a plane at high altitudes, and was moving slowly. The witnesses described the object as a "metallic sheen" or "silver." Its speed was determined as "moving slowly" and its maneuverability was "none."

The altitude of the object was estimated to be around 20,000 feet. No sound was heard, and no exhaust trail was seen by any of the three observers.

Comments of Lowry Flight Service Center: Weather for Sioux City as of 0930 on 30 March 1950: Clear, with 15 miles visibility.
