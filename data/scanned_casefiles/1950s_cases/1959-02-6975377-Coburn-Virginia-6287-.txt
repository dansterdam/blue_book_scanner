The image shows a photograph of what appears to be the trail of a mysterious object in the night sky. The photograph depicts a bright, elongated streak of light against a dark background, with a small white dot at the top. This could potentially be evidence of a UFO sighting, though the exact nature of the object cannot be definitively determined from this single photograph alone.

Information:
On 30 January 1959, at approximately 1910 hours, the reporting officer received a phone call from a Mrs. Virginia Coburn of West Virginia, who reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the sky over her property in Virginia. Mrs. Coburn stated that she had been outside her home when she noticed a bright object in the sky that seemed to be hovering and then accelerated rapidly before disappearing from view.

The reporting officer contacted Mrs. Coburn and obtained the following additional details:
- Mrs. Coburn stated the object was round in shape and appeared to be metallic in nature.
- The object was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before it accelerated and disappeared.
- Mrs. Coburn indicated that the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet.
- No other witnesses were identified at the time of the incident.

Conclusion:
Based on the information provided by the witness, this incident is classified as an "Unidentified" sighting. No evidence or further information was obtained that would allow for a more conclusive determination of the nature of the object observed. The case will be forwarded to Project Blue Book for further review and investigation.]

TELEPHONE CALl FROM MRS. COBURN, 2-6-59

On 2-6-59 at 10:30 A.M. Mrs. Coburn called to report that on 2-5-59 at approximately 6:45 P.M. she and her daughter had observed a bright object in the sky. She stated that it appeared to be a large, round, silver object which hovered over the town of Bluefield, Virginia for approximately one-half hour before it disappeared. Mrs. Coburn said she thought it might be an unidentified flying object and wanted to report it to the proper authorities.

Mrs. Coburn was advised that sightings of this nature should be reported to the U.S. Air Force. She was courteous and cooperative throughout the call.

The body being an oval about two or three feet long and about one and one half feet wide. The top portion being somewhat rounded and the bottom portion being somewhat pointed or tapered. The entire object was a metallic gray in color and seemed to be highly polished or reflecting light. There were no visible seams, joints, windows, or other surface features on the object. The only unusual aspect was that the object appeared to be hovering silently and motionlessly about 20 to 30 feet above the ground.

The object was observed for approximately 3 to 5 minutes before it silently accelerated and quickly disappeared over the nearby trees. During the time it was observed, it made no sound and displayed no visible means of propulsion.

INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT

SUMMARY OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA SIGHTING

1. NAME OF OBSERVER: Mrs. Coburn
2. LOCATION: Coburn, Virginia
3. DATE/TIME OF OBSERVATION: February 6, 1959 at approximately 1900 hours
4. REPORTED PHENOMENA: The observer reported observing a bright, silvery object moving rapidly across the sky.

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:

The observer, Mrs. Coburn, reported witnessing a bright, silvery object move rapidly across the sky from the southwest to the northeast. The object was observed for approximately 5 seconds and appeared to be gliding or coasting rather than powered flight. No sound was associated with the object. The observer described the object as being larger than a normal aircraft and estimated it to be at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet. Weather conditions at the time were clear with unlimited visibility.

CONCLUSIONS:

Based on the details provided, the object observed cannot be definitively identified. The rapid, silent movement and unusual size and appearance of the object are factors that suggest the sighting may have involved an unidentified aerial phenomena. However, without additional evidence or information, a conclusive determination cannot be made. The case is listed as unresolved.
