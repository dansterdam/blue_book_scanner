1. It is difficult to evaluate the inclosed report without indications as to
rates of speed, etc., of the target. The studies suggest possible weather
balloons, although the evaluation Intelligence Officer Captain Davis may very well
be correct in attributing the returns to a malfunction.

2. For your information, this branch, recognizing its inability to give
adequate attention to these reports, and lacking personnel versed in weather
characteristics, etc., has recommended to the Electronics Division that immediate action
be taken to secure the services of a competent consultant who can intelligently
evaluate these reports and provide answers to the field which will satisfy them.

PROBABLY WERE AIRCRAFT WHICH WERE ERRONEOUSLY CORRELATED TO THE
TARGET PICKED UP BY THE FPS-16. THERE WERE SEVERAL OF OUR F-102'S
IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE LAST PLOTS
WERE AT NORMAL JET ALTITUDES. PART 12. OVERALL ON PATH OF UFOB
IS AVAILABLE AT 678 ACWRON, TYNDALL AFB, FLORIDA IF NEEDED. NOTE:
REASON FOR DELAY IN REPORT WAS INFORMATION FROM EGLIN AFB COULD
