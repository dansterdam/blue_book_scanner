There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten memorandum or report from Project Blue Book about a UFO sighting in Novorossisk, USSR.

The text in the document is as follows:

Memorandum of file - UFO Sighting foreign
Urgent: UFO Incident, Novorossisk, USSR

1. Conference held between Major Reyss, General Molorets, Director and 2 officers of the Air Force on Wednesday morning, 14 May 1958.

2. Purpose: To discuss incident with view to excluding nature of object might not affect security of state and resolve questions and doubts.

3. Conclusions: My Reyss concurred with the judgments. Hypothesis that, from the limited information given, the characteristics observed from the incident indicate that it was possibly short-range missile-type operations.

4. Pending receipt of further or confirming information, will leave under that category.
