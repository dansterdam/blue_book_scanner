The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically an Air Intelligence Information Report.

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Subject: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object
Location: Ko-Eun-Ri Area, Hung-Nam, North Korea
Date: 17 October 1952
Observer: Technical Sergeant Kenneth E. Porges, USAF, Co-pilot, Martin Air Grp 23
SUMMARY: Information on a certain observed aerial object by the co-pilot of a Martin bomber on a mission over North Korea. The object was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes as it maneuvered at a high rate of speed at an altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet. The object had a circular shape and no visible means of propulsion. The aircraft and crew were not affected by the object's presence. There were no unusual disturbances of the atmosphere noted.
AT's COMMENTS: The object as described exhibits characteristics traditionally associated with "flying saucers" or "unidentified flying objects." The sighting report is considered to be authentic and consistent with similar reports of this nature. However, the exact nature of the object remains undetermined.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DRS 3-6004th AFIS 
REPORT NO. 52-269

1. Estimates of size, distance and altitude are vague since no definite references could be established. Since the object came from behind and apparently did end up at some distance to the North, it was evidently moving at a speed in excess of the 777.

Observers' conversation just fail to provide any visible passing under the determined cloud cover. The object was sighted silhouetted against the darkened sky during the attempted interception.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DOC NO. 6004th AISS 52-269

STATEMENT OF T/SGT L. D. YOUNG, USHER:

On 1 October, approximately 2200 hours we had been on heading of approximately 030 at 8000 feet. As the ground was visible and aircraft was traveling over rugged mountainous terrain into Korea, we checked our position by celestial and other navigation means. It was my observation and opinion that the object we saw was flying at an altitude in excess of 40,000 feet, traveling south at a terrific speed. It was not a balloon, jet aircraft or anything else with which I am familiar. It was generally circular in shape, emitting a bright white light. I immediately made a turn back onto the reverse course and attempted to close with the object, but lost sight of it.

I can state that this object was not any aircraft with which I am familiar or any natural phenomenon that I have ever seen. I have had several years of experience in air navigation and am very familiar with aircraft of all types. I feel that this object was a solid object of tremendous speed far in excess of our own capabilities. It was not a star, planet, meteor, or anything that I have ever seen or heard of. I can only conclude that it was something other than natural or man-made.
