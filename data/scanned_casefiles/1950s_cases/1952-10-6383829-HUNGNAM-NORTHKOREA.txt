SUMMARY:
At 2200J, 12 Oct 52, Maj WB Carr, pilot of an F-51, and O.D. Young, radar observer were flying escort CAP at approximately eight thousand (8000) feet, and on a heading of one hundred sixty (160) knots and on a heading of three zero (030) degrees. Over the water off Hungnam, North Korea (T8210) they made a left turn to approximately two hundred thirty (230) degrees. While in the turn the RO sighted a reddish orange ball of light at approximately four (4) o'clock position at UTM coordinates W8000 and at an altitude of seven thousand five hundred (7500) feet. He immediately notified the pilot. At five (5) o'clock position it appeared to be from six (6) to eight (8) inches in diameter. The pilot then made a right turn to intercept this light. The aircraft speed was increased to approximately two hundred twenty (220) knots and the RO attempted to pick up the object on the radar set with negative results. There was no exhaust trail or aerodynamic features visible. The crew observed no aerodynamic features.

They then decided it must have been from the ground so they turned back on their original heading. As they turned, the object was again sighted instantly eight (8) to ten (10) miles away and traveling at a speed approximately two (2) times faster. They matched it disappear. The light burned for approximately five (5) minutes and then went away to the North. All observations were visual. The weather at the time of the observations was CAVU, visibility was good. The crew stated that they had sighted flares in this area on previous missions, but that they had sighted none on this particular mission. However ground lights were observed on this mission before and after sighting the object; but the crew stated that the ground lights did not resemble the unidentified object.

At the time of this observation Major Carr had flown six (6) combat missions in this theater. He was a fighter pilot in WWII with sixty (60) combat missions. C/O Young had completed twenty-one (21) combat missions in this theater.

AF FORM 112-PART II

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: Det 1, 6004th AMS                 REPORT NO: 52-269                 PAGE 2 OF 2

D/I FEAF Comments:

1. Estimates of size, distance and altitude are vague since no definite reference points were available. Since the object came from behind, and apparently did end up at some distance to the North, it was evidently moving at a speed in excess of the F-97.

2. A conventional jet tail glow could be visible passing under the observers at 377 was in the Port turn, and since the altitude was not determined, the unidentified could have been outside the radar cone during the attempted interception.

STATEMENT OF MAJOR W. E. CARR USMC

Flying escort CAP at about 8000 feet we turned port to heading 240 and a large orange ball of light approximately 8 light inches in diameter appeared on our starboard quarter at approximately 4 o'clock and appeared to be getting larger and coming at us so I turned hard starboard and sped up for an intercept. At this time our speed was approximately 220 knots. As this time the light appeared very near at approximately 2 to 3 thousand feet and nearly level as we speeded up. To its apparent descent and draw away rapidly to a distance of a few miles at a speed twice as fast as ours. The NO call to No Joy a few times and after approximately two minutes as we were being drawn away from our escort CAP area we broke it off. The light must have burned a total of 5 minutes appearing to descend and fade away to the north. This object did not resemble any type of flare of which I am familiar with.

STATEMENT OF GWO L. D. YOUNG USMCR

On 12 October approximately 2100 hours we had been heading of approximately 030 at 8000 feet at a speed of approximately 160 knots just off Hungham over the water were making a fort turn to approximately 230 during turn I noticed a reddish orange ball of light about 6" in diameter through plexiglass as if a plane were flying wing on us in the turn. It was way too bright for flying lights but looked close to us on-wing from behind at about 5 o'clock seemingly same altitude. No beam or flash like a ground light.

Noticed pilot. We immediately made a turn back on our course on about 030. I switched to intercept and we chased the light. After approximately 3 to 5 minutes I was unable to pick up, losing up on it or being below it at course. On either 5 mile or 10 mile range. As we chased I did not see it at 6° course. Finally decided it must be from ground and no turn back to it of course. As with 8 to 10 miles or more and much smaller say 1/3 size or less and was dimmer. Its speed now was approximately 1500 feet per minute as near as I could estimate.

At approximately 1500 feet yet both hill and shore line were 5-10 miles away or more. It just appeared like a ball with float ring like those 5 itself as near as I could tell. It traveled from close behind to far away at speed quite in excess of 220 knots. The color appeared reddish orange at first to bluish red at last. It might have been a rocket only it would have to be fired from a water or over water base. I had observed lookout lights flashed in the approximate area before from ground and afterward in area where the light was last observed. They were lower and a white or yellowish light.
