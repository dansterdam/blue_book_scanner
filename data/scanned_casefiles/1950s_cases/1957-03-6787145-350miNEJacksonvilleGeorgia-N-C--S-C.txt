Date: April 24, 1957

I was a passenger on the plane described on the reverse side.
I did not observe an unidentified flying object after the
evasive action referred to on the reverse side.

The weather was clear. I was asleep when the pilot took the
evasive action, which I was later informed consisted of zooming upwards.
I was awakened when my head struck the baggage rack above my seat
(caused I understand by the fact that the pilot leveled off too
abruptly after zooming upwards). One engine was conked out after the
accident - whether or not it was out of commission before the accident,
I do not know.

I saw no flying object at any time during the flight.

I was a passenger on the plane described on the reverse side.

I did observe an unidentified flying object after the evasive action referred to on the reverse side. It looked like a fireball, was travelling North and was in sight two or three seconds. The weather was clear. I cannot identify the object. I was asleep when the pilot took the evasive action, which I was later informed consisted of zooming upwards. I was awakened when my head struck the baggage rack above my seat (caused I understand by the fact that the pilot leveled off too abruptly after zooming upwards).

Pues dentro del avión fue que vou qude ver lo que paso pero fuera de el avión no puedo decir nada pues no ví nada. Dentro del avión suce dió lo siguiente: que el piloto y camarara no pudieron ningún anuncio para que nos abrocháramos los cinturones y al recibir el impacto del - avión pues todo el mundo se salió de sus asientos y cayeron al suelo y se qude decir que nadie salió ileso y que todos los salvavidas y demás paquetes que iban dentro del avión volaban por el aire dentro del avión y caían encima de los pasajeros. Por supuesto yo y mi niño nos agolpamos bastante. La única información que tuvimos después del accidente dicho por una de las camareras fue de que íbamos a chocar con un jet - del Navy. Tengo entendido también que algunos de los motores fallaron también.

Memorandum In File - PAA UFO Incident
Subj: Review of CRB Report Relating Case Along

1. A review of the testimony given by
thirteen (13) persons discloses that only
two observed the object. The general description
given by each:

W/O J. J. Moss - "Like a light yellow
by electric bulbs" - passed
"like a ball"

Dr. M. S. Jacko - "Looked like a fire ball
- in sight 2 or 3 seconds"

2. Other flights, ranging from 50 to
133 miles from the PAA flight in question,
all reported somewhat similar sightings at
about precisely the same time. Object was
observed by the PAA flight.

3. The distance points above make it highly improbable
that jet or rocket sightings would be observed
at such distances with the naked eye. Matters
and a variety of other details further can
be seen for both distances, only after given
the element of being much closer to the observed
object, the above only tend to support

STATEMENT

On 9 March 1957, at 0110 hours EST, I was copilot in a C-47 aircraft flying approximately 15 miles south of Columbia, South Carolina, at an altitude of 2500 on a heading of 060 degrees Magnetic. At this time I perceived a fiery object about 2 o'clock in my position at an unknown range. The object was a fiery ball, green in color, with a white trail, and in the ball. It appeared to be climbing on a course parallel to ours and at an extreme rate of speed. The object was in sight about 15 seconds and was suddenly snuffed out, as if a light was turned off. There were no clouds in the sky, the moon had set, and it was a dark, clear night with excellent visibility.

STATEMENT

On the night of 8-9 March 1957, Captain Belmont (pilot) and Major Landis (co-pilot) of 4417 MIG-16100 were flying from England AFB, S. C. The flight was made at 9000' and was uneventful until after passing Aiken, S. C. At approximately 0125 hours we cancelled our IFR flight plan and proceeded to make shallow let-down to the Shaw radio range on a heading of 060 degrees. At approximately Ohio hours at an altitude of 2500' (position 15 miles S Columbia, S. C.) at a speed 130 mph indicated an unusual phenomenon appeared off our right wing at the same altitude and flight path. The object appeared as a large ball of yellowish-green fire with a brilliant tail with a length approximately 15 to 20 times the diameter of the ball. The object appeared to be approximately 21 inches in diameter and appeared to pass within 200 yards of our aircraft. Both the fire ball and the tail appeared to be more or less solid as opposed to the thin vapor appearance of a jet or at least some exhaust. At this extremity of the tail solid globules of fire appeared to break off and gradually die out in much the same manner as flying napalm liquids. The object appeared in view for an estimated 10-15 seconds and then merely disappeared as a light goes out, with no explosion parts and other action.

Weather conditions were as follows: Clear sky, visibility 15 to 20 miles with light ground haze. Stars visible, no clouds and no moon.

Flying experience: 17 years
2500 hours military flying
1000 hours jet flying (RF-80, F-84, T-33)
Senior pilots rating
300 hours civilian flying time
Duty: Staff Intelligence Officer
Experience: 10 years

Upon landing Shaw tower asked if we had seen any unusual phenomena. They had received a report of an unusual sighting by an airline pilot.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0110, Saturday, March 9, 1957, I was riding in Captain Lloyd Finleyson's automobile. We had just passed through the North A.P. gate, entering the base on Rhodes Ave. when an extremely fast moving object entered my line of sight. The object, at an estimated altitude of 2000 ft, was travelling from a South Westerly direction to a North Easterly direction at an intermediate rate of speed, that estimated a speed similar to a meteorite. The color was a bluish green. It had a slight tail of light of the same color as the body appeared to my vision for approximately two seconds. At the end of this time I saw what appeared to be sparks emitting from the tail and immediately after the sparks appeared the entire object disappeared just as an electric bulb fades from sight, in a darkness, when the electricity is turned off. It did not appear to explode, shower sparks in all directions, just turned off. The distance from my position to the object, as hard to estimate. However, I believe the object was between 10 and 20 statute miles to the East South East area traveling from a South West to a North East position. I had the feeling that it was a natural phenomenon even though I had never seen such an object before. The weather was clear, the object appeared about six feet in diameter and I heard no noise.

Major, USAF

STATEMENT

A large fiery white ball apparently 5 - 6 feet in diameter with a trailing tail travelling from southwest to northeast appeared in the sky low enough to be clearly visible from the driver's seat of my automobile, which I was driving on Shaw AFB, at approximately 0200 on 9 March 57.

I watched it for possibly 5 - 6 seconds, during which it travelled a rapid speed on a smooth level course, then disintegrated suddenly and as it did so the white light disappeared from the fragments almost immediately and nothing more was seen.

As stated, I was driving my automobile when first sighting the object; I stopped at once and looked until it disappeared. I heard no noise from the object. I had no perspective from which to judge its distance from me and thus cannot accurately state the size of it, although as stated it appeared to be 6 - 8 feet in diameter. The night was clear.

PAN AMERICAN AIRLINES
8 MAY 1957

At approximately 3 o'clock in the morning, the pilot of an airliner from New York to Puerto Rico pulled up and over sharply to avoid collecting with a "brilliant greenish-white object" that suddenly appeared in his path. The pilot and co-pilot described it as resembling a huge glaring spotlight. A number of passengers were injured during the violent maneuvers and required hospitalization.

The fact that two other airliners approximately 175 miles away observed the object at the same time ruled out aircraft and missiles. This was later confirmed by all military and civil agencies. From a description given by the crew and passengers who happened to see the object, and from interrogation of the CAA and the Navy, the Center concluded that the object was a seldom seen form of meteor, a bolide, commonly referred to as a "fireball." The analysis was independently reviewed and concurred with by a well-known astrophysicist now with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

The Commanding Officer, ATIC, Dir Sciences Div.

Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Sir:

Before making my request, I had better tell you my official position so that you understand the better why I make it. I am Professor of Astronomy University of Penna. From 1925-1954, when I had to retire by automatic rule, I was director of the Flower and Cook Observatories. I have published scores of papers on the subject of meteors and fireballs, the last important one of which is enclosed. On pages 313 and 314 you will find a table of fireball paths and orbit, more extensive than all others ever published by an American Astronomer.

Now as to request- On 1957 March 15 at about 10 p.m., C.S.T., a very brilliant fireball or meteor passed over the Gulf States ending probably S.W. of New Orleans, in or near the Gulf. From the Navy Dept. I have one good observation from a ship, and by newspaper clippings reports by very many people, most of small value, as coordinates are not given.

as the object was so brilliant, there seems every chance that numerous observations were sent to your center where "flying saucers" etc. are worked on.

Further, as this was an astronomical body, with nothing mysterious about it, there can be no reason why reports should be classified or held from reputable scientists.

I am therefore requesting you to have the reports on this object mailed to me on loan, so that I can compute its atmospheric path and if possible its orbit in space. The reports will be carefully returned, and I will be happy to communicate the results I obtain.

As I served on the scientific staff of Aberdeen Proving Ground during 1918 and 1919, and as local consultant during the Second World War, I had the proper clearance.

Very sincerely yours,

Major Lawrence J. Tacker, USAF
Executive Officer

Office of Information Services
Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker:

Many thanks for your reply of February 27 to my letter asking for possible reports on the great fireball of 1957 March 15 which crossed several of the Southern States and ended beyond New Orleans.

From the numerous press reports received on it and from would consist it a flying saucer, could, and that the human dealing with UFO would have reports. And even if not, that some of the numerous Army pilots must have seen and reported it. But as you state they did not, that is true.

With regard to two other fireballs you mention, seen last March, I would indeed be glad to receive copies of reports in your hands. Often just one more good report enables me to compute the atmospheric path and orbit in space. In any case, we attempt to keep as complete a file as possible on such objects, and have several thousand fireball in a card file. The Hydrographic Office of the U.S. Navy sends me copies of such reports from ships; I would be most happy if the Army and Air Force would do the same. At least, such reports are of statistical value even if no path can be computed.

As to not being able to get reports, due to classification, my good friend Dr. Lincoln LaFass of the University of New Mexico has for some years gathered such reports for the military authorities, in his general region. I have in vain tried to get copies, but while he and I are on most friendly terms, he has always declined to give me copies, saying they are classified. Last year I made an attempt to secure them, aided by Col. D.M. Barringer, formerly of Air Force, but received nothing. Some are supposed to refer to UFO, but as I work out ( without his data) several orbital tracks of such objects, there is no doubt they were bright fireballs. In any case, your help in seeing that I can secure copies of such reports would be greatly appreciated and I hope of value to science and our country.

Very sincerely,

Another important point that is significant to the case is the fact that two hours before the Van Winkle
sighting, Capt. Van Winkle had been flying in the same general area and had seen a UFO—but two hours
before. In that first sighting, he would indicate, with his later radio UFO reports, that he was certain the object was not a balloon, missile, aircraft, or any other similar fireball in the same area or high.

As later checked by Civilian Sources and Military Intelligence Investigation (3rd district) and by NICAP, he would fight flying near Atlanta, Ga. with a detailed capital NICAP, he made fighting two identical reports that of Capt. Winkle.

This particular sighting Capt. Perkins was en route to San Jose on a clear flight when he and his flight engineer saw a brilliant green light during twilight, or NIWI. It was approximately 10 degrees on a horizontal course. At first, they did not realize its smooth motion; that's all noted.

The speed, Perkins said, was not as great on a horizontal course. But it did not fall like a flare, suddenly dropping in population. This certainly brought it out of the ordinary.

From evidence one, particular detail revealed Capt. Perkins went to NICAP, who again noted this.

The 3rd trail-like section might have been of red tail—suggesting the possibility of a rocket exhaust. Capt. Perkins could have been, if able, a credible witness, but he would make certain even of the Civil Aeronautics Board's being able to check the fan.

Also, the similar about by Perkins told then another such missile, with a racial flavor, had gone over the

Pan American Airliner Case
Still Unsolved, Says CAB

Despite an Air Force spokesman's claim, the cosmetic UFO report made by a Pan American World Airways captain on March 9 is still unexplained, according to the Civil Aeronautics Board. The Pan American pilot, Capt. Matthew Van Winkle, reportedly passed his log book to the CAB for investigation with an Unidentified Flying Object.

Visiting Comet
To Be Visible
On Saturday

(Near Miss permitting, a visitor from outer space) will be visible at sunset Saturday.

The Acord-Roiafd comet detached its closest position to the sun April 1 and now is observable.

It should be particularly bright and can be seen by the naked eye at sunset.

It will be shining away from the sun and should be visible with little difficulty in the April sky.

The comet, visible just above the horizon, slightly west of northwest, will be visible for two or three days.

Alrady, big in the West, the comet is making its first appearance. Acord and Roiafd, astronomers, said the comet will be visible for two or three days at the end of April.

AF Accused
of Hush-up
On Saucers
PHILADELPHIA, April 5 - A retired Marine Corps major says the Air Force has hushed up results of flying saucer investigations and "gagged" a United States Senator.

The charge was made by Donald E. Keyhoe, director of the National Investigations Committee of Aerial Phenomena.

He declared last night he will formally ask the Air Force to turn over by its organization the unidentified object reports which he said the Air Force says have been "satisfactorily identified."

Keyhoe disagrees with the Air Force, stating, which list 97% of the sightings as unidentified. He says almost 20% must be explained as unidentified.

Keyhoe, former business associate of Charles A. Lindbergh, is the committee's director. Others: Gen. Albert G. Wedemeyer, Gen. Delmar S. Fahrney.

The committee has been set up to evaluate saucer sightings and publish most answers to the question.

Keyhoe said that Richard Ruggle (D) of the Senate Armed Services Committee had been told by the Air Force not to disclose any information.

He charged that the public had never been told that Air Force jet fighters have fired upon unidentified flying objects.

He also stated he had a report of a radar sighting which showed a mid-air collision between a jet fighter and an object it was sent to intercept.

"Neither the plane nor the pilot were ever seen again," Keyhoe said.

AIRLINER AVOIDS
FLAMING OBJECT

Pilot Sends Plane Into Steep
Climb Over Atlantic—No
Jets in Area at Time

SAN JUAN, P.R., March 12 (AP)—A Pan American World Airways plane high over the Atlantic Ocean today narrowly escaped collision with a very bright object which forced the pilot to take evasive action to avoid being hit.

From passenger accounts, Captain Van Winkle suffered apparently because of the incident. Capt. Van Winkle, who was in command at the transport at the time, told of the mysterious object.

New York said a report reaching there said Captain Van Winkle had seen a very bright core and a fringe of flame.

The armed forces indicated there had been no jet planes in the area at the time.

The pilot of at least seven other aircraft saw the mysterious object.

A spokesman at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida said the object was "something strange."

Captain Van Winkle said he had pulled the plane into a steep climb, rising to 19,000 feet, when the sudden maneuver apparently averted a near collision.

On the plane's arrival three passengers and a stewardess were taken to a hospital. Mrs. and Mrs. Abraham Glickman and another passenger, Soto, and Julia Santiago Rodriguez, afterwards were hospitalized for treatment of shock. X-rays showed none of them suffered broken bones.

Force Base in Florida said the object "was no missile from our range." He said the San Juan-New York air route was far from the regular missile range.

Captain Van Winkle said his first impression was that the object had been a jet plane. But when it got closer, he said he had noticed it was not shaped like any jet he had seen. To avoid a collision, Captain Van Winkle said he had pulled the plane into a steep climb, rising some 1,500 feet in a few seconds. The sudden maneuver apparently caught those aboard unaware.

On the plane's arrival three passengers and a stewardess required hospitalization.

Mr. and Mrs. Abraham Gillow of Philadelphia; another passenger identified as Montague Soto, and stewardess, were hospitalized for treatment of shock and lacerations. X-rays showed some of them suffered broken bones.

Captain Van Winkle described the mysterious missile as a "burning greenish white object, unrecognizable but definitely not a meteor."

Captain Van Winkle, 36 years old, lives at 65 Constitution Road, Levittown, L. I.

Captain Tells of Dodge
SAY JUAN, P. R., March 9 (JP)—Captain Van Winkle said today the weather was good and clear when suddenly he spotted an object, apparently rising vertically. Instinctively, he thought it might be another plane. He said he pulled the plane about 45 degrees and rolled the plane.

Pilot, apparently I swerved it too much and at the forty-four passengers, except one or two who had belts fastened, came out of their seats and rolled on the floor.

There was about seven aircraft in the area at the time and all seven of us were aglow. Then was a distance of around 300 miles from the center of those seven aircraft.

All of us were from New York to the track from New York to San Juan.

A Runaway Missile
WASHINGTON, March 9 (UP)—The Defense Department is unable today to identify the mystery object.

A spokesman said the department had received no report on the incident. He refused to say whether a runaway guided missile might possibly have been the unidentified object.

2. Pan American Airline Case (New York)

At approximately 1:30 o'clock in the morning, from New York to Porto Rico, a "brilliant greenish-white" object was sighted. The pilot and co-pilot describe it and a number of passengers were injured requiring hospitalization.

The fact that the object was observed at 1:30 and later confirmed by all military and civil agencies by the crew and passengers during interrogation of the CAA in the form of a seldom seen form of meteor, a bolide, commonly referred to as "fireball". The analysis was independently reviewed and concurred with.

From 1957 UFO Investigator

"The UFO Investigator"

"Still Unsolved, Says CAB"

Despite an Air Force spokesman's claim, the scientific UFO panel in the American World Airways case has found no satisfactory explanation for the mysterious object seen by Capt. Van Winkle and First Officer Taylor.

During the CAB close examination hearing, Capt. Van Winkle told of seeing a strange, bright object while flying near Jacksonville, Fla.

Our Hawks, serving passengers on a flight from San Juan, Porto Rico, airliner were in turned when the pilot sighted the DC-6 up sharply to miss a "large, greenish white, clearly defined, cigar-shaped object" which was on a collision course with the plane.

The pilots of several other airliners in the same vicinity confirm the sighting.

Two weeks later jet interceptors were scrambled over Los Angeles to look for a "UFO".

According to the records, the first report of the brilliant and mysterious "light" or "craft" came in the west and was more and more will begin to come in. At the Farming light near Boulder, Colorado Boulevard is driven stopped that a site to get out and look. At it neared the Air Defense Command Filter Center in Pasadena the filter center personnel, those that could be spared, went out and looking. They saw it. Police switchboards lit up a solid red as it crossed the San Gabriel Valley.

Near midnight a CAA radar picked up unidentified target near the Oxnard AFB, at Oxnard, California, (northwest of Los Angeles) and at almost that identical time people on the airliners saw the light.

This did it, and two powerful jets, equipped with all electronic gear, screaming into the area.

But it was the same old story - no contact - the UFO was gone.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

One of the most fantastic apparitions to confront a pilot is a group
of luminous objects flaunting through the air in more or less geometri-
cal formation. The objects often seem to be heading directly toward
the plane on a collision course but, as though under intelligent con-
trol, seem to veer off at the last possible instant and then disappear
at incredible speed. The pilot usually recognizes this frightening
phenomenon as an exploding meteor or a cluster of fireballs. Oc-
casionally the sight is so extraordinary that he insists it could not
have been a mere meteor but must have been some weird space-
craft. Airmen of unquestioned competence have made this mistake,
sometimes because they more than half believe in extraterrestrial
visitors, but more often because they know less than they suppose
about meteors.

In trying to identify the alarming objects approaching his plane,
the pilot often thinks first of a meteor, then rejects the idea with
some form of the remark, "Whatever it was, it was certainly not a
meteor; I've seen meteors and I can't be fooled." He usually adds
that no meteor could travel so fast (or so slowly) as the one he
saw; so high (or so low); could have such a color; steer so "obvious"
a collision course; fly as part of so orderly a group; move in so
level (or so steeply angled) a path; maintain so steady a course;
change course so abruptly; move so silently; or create so loud a
detonation.

Such an incident occurred on a Pan American flight from New
York to San Juan early on the morning of March 9, 1957. At about
3:30 A.M. when the plane was off Jacksonville, Florida, the pilot
and the flight engineer saw a burning, greenish-white, round ob-
ject coming out of nowhere, seemingly only a half mile away and
headed across their nose on a direct collision course [sic]. In such a
situation a plane's captain cannot waste time in analyzing what he
sees, but must act. In a violent evasive move he put the plane into a
climb of about 1500 feet, during which several passengers were
thrown out of their seats and injured. At the same moment the
crews of at least seven other flights within an area of 300 miles
were reporting the same object. One witness saw it split in two and
the fiery rear section drop away. About an hour earlier, the pilot
of another plane in the area had seen the breakup of a similar me-
teor but had not reported it. In spite of all the evidence that the
unknown was a normal meteor, breaking apart as many meteors do,
the Pan American pilot, "having seen thousands of meteors," could
not accept the object as a natural phenomenon although he did
realize, after he heard the other reports, that he had greatly un-
derestimated its distance. Although the object showed all the char-
acteristics of a typical fireball, the flying-saucer cultists have tried
to convert this undoubted meteor into an "unknown object." [19,

SWERVED HIS PLANE SHARPLY SATURDAY TO AVOID A COLLISION WITH A
LUMINOUS FLYING OBJECT THAT VEERED INTO HIS PATH. (END PRECEDE)
BY CAPT.
PILOT OF PAN AMERICAN'S FLIGHT 257 TO SAN JUAN, P.R.
CONTRIBUTED BY INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICE)
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COMING RIGHT AT ME FROM AT MOST A FEW
HUNDRED YARDS, BUT AS TO WHAT "IT" WAS, I HAVE LESS AN IDEA TODAY
THAN WHEN I TRIED TO EVADE IT..AND THEN, FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT WAS.
("IT" WAS LACONICALLY DESCRIBED AS A UFO--UNIDENTIFIED FLYING
OBJECT---IN A RADIO REPORT RELAYED TO EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE
HEADQUARTERS BY A CIVIL AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION COMMUNICATIONS
CENTER THAT INTERCEPTED ____'S REPORT.
(AN UNIDENTIFIED REPORT SAID A JET INTERCEPT TASK FORCE ACCOMPANIED
BY A RADAR PLANE WAS SENT ALOFT TO INVESTIGATE FROM A STRATEGIC
AIR COMMAND FIGHTER BASE IN THE SOUTH. ITS FINDINGS, IF ANY, ARE
CLASSIFIED.
(SOME SIMILAR SIGHTINGS IN THE PAST HAVE LATER BEEN EXPLAINED
AS DUE TO THE BRILLIANCE OF THE PLANET VENUS WHEN SEEN THROUGH AN
ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE. AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING, VENUS WAS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN SKIES, ABOUT 15 DEGREES ABOVE THE
HORIZON AT HIS 10,000 FOOT ALTITUDE, WHICH COULD HAVE MADE IT APPEAR
TO BE ALMOST IN THE PLANE'S PATH.)
MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE FLYING OBJECT LOOKED LIKE A BIG
SPOTLIGHT. I BELIEVE IT WAS "ROUND". IT APPEARED TO BE ON A COLLISION
COURSE AHEAD OF MY PLANE, A LITTLE BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT, AS FAR
AS I KNOW IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
MY FLIGHT ENGINEER SPOTTED IT THE SAME INSTANT I DID. I HEARD HIM CATCH HIS BREATH. MY CO-PILOT HAD HIS BACK TURNED FROM THE COCKPIT WINDOW TAKING A READING ON
OUR POSITION FROM NAVIGATIONAL INSTRUMENTS BEHIND HIM.
FOR A SPLIT SECOND I WAS BEWILDERED. MY REFLEX, AND INSTANTLYWISE PASSENGER SAFETY IN YOUR HANDS--THE TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY
OF PASSENGER SAFETY IN YOUR HANDS--I REASONED SOMETHING LIKE THIS:
WE WERE CONSIDERABLY WEST OF OUR NORMAL TRACK BECAUSE I WAS
TRYING TO AVOID THE FIRST OF A STORM, BUT MY POSITION WAS KNOWN
THROUGH PERIODIC RADIO REPORTS.
MY FIRST REACTION, THEREFORE, THAT IT MIGHT BE A JET FIGHTER
INTERCEPT MUST BE ERRONEOUS. I HAD THOUGHT OF JETS BY REFLEX BECAUSE
THE LIGHT FROM THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE LIKE THE AFTERGLOW FROM A JET
EXHAUST.
BUT AGAIN IN THE SAME SPLIT-SECOND I RULED OUT AN INTERCEPT
BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS COME AT LEAST BY TWO--ONE PULLING ALONGSIDE OF
YOU READY FOR ACTION, THE OTHER THROWING A SPOTLIGHT ON YOUR
IDENTIFICATION MARKINGS FROM A DISTANCE TO FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE.
THIS IS A ROUTINE OPERATION WHEN RADIO TROUBLES PREVENT PILOTS
FROM REPORTING EXACT FIXES WHILE FLYING OVER APPROACHES TO THE U.S.
FROM WHICH AN ENEMY COULD LAUNCH AN ATTACK. THE AREA, KNOWN AS A
DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONE, WHICH STRETCHES MILES OUT TO SEA, IS
GUARDED AROUND THE CLOCK.
AFTER REASONING THIS OUT, I FELT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING FOR ME TO
DO TO SAVE MY PASSENGERS AND MY SHIP. THAT WAS TO PULL UP SHARPLY,
TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION. I DID SO--AT ONCE.
WE HAD BEEN ON INSTRUMENT FLIGHT UNTIL MINUTES BEFORE I SAW
THE OBJECT AND IT WAS PITCH BLACK OUTSIDE. I WAS IN ROUTINE
COMMUNICATION WITH FIVE OTHER PAN AMERICAN PLANES, AN EASTERN

FACTUAL REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

STATEMENT OF ACCIDENT:

Over the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 347 nautical miles southwest of Bermuda, B.W.I., and approximately 705 nautical miles east of Jacksonville, Florida, March 9, 1957 at 0430 AST.

Pan American World Airways Flight 257, Douglas DC-6A, N6260C.

Damage: None

Crew: Captain M. Van Winkle, Copilot D. W. Taylor, Flight Engineer J. Washuta, Purser C. E. Silva - no injuries, and Stewardess Julia Santiago, minor injuries.

Passengers: 45 - including one infant. One serious injury and 22 minor injuries reported.

Captain executed evasive action to avoid unidentified flying object.

FLIGHT DETAILS:

1. The flight involved departed Idlewild Airport, New York, N.Y. at approximately 2345 EST, March 8, 1957 on a scheduled Tourist type Flight direct to San Juan, P.R. via Tuna Intersection and the Oscar route.

2. The flight was cleared on an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan to cruise at an altitude of 19,000 ft. to San Juan with alternate Borenquen, P.R.

A. At approximately 0430 AST on 3-9-57, while cruising at the assigned altitude just west of India-Oscar check point, an abrupt climbing evasive action was executed to avoid an unidentified flying object, which action unsteated and injured a number of passengers and one crew member in the aircraft's cabin.

3. The flight continued without further such difficulty, but at 0554 AST a number 4 engine failure was experienced and the flight continued to San Juan at a lower altitude with the No. 4 propeller feathered, and arrived there at 1224 AST that date.


- page 87 -

INVESTIGATION:

1. The flight, according to the Captain involved, was in instrument conditions (no fine time) it reached an altitude of 800 ft. after take-off, until two to two and one-half hours later when it reached clear weather at a position slightly west of approximately the Delta Oscar check point and approximately 247 nautical miles north of the point involved.

A. Approximately one hour later, according to the Captain involved, while the flight was cruising in clear weather at a 19,000 ft., almost all passengers asleep, the seat belt sign off, and the automatic pilot engaged, an object described as a dim orange glow immediately followed by a brilliant greenish white light, approximately the size of an arc light or jet interceptor spotlight, apparently traveling from west to east in a right angle collision course, was observed for a few seconds, and a left turn climbing pull-up to avoid a collision was executed. The pull-up was forceful, according to the Captain, in an effort to overpass the automatic pilot, which caused the aircraft to reach violently and gain 1500 ft. of altitude in a few seconds, making an abrupt leveling off necessary to prevent stalling. Slight off bright was said to have been lost due to the maneuver.

2. At the time of the accident the aircraft, according to the aircraft flight record, was an unknown distance west and above of this clear check point on a magnetic heading of 187°, cruising at a ground speed of 198 K.

A. The magnetic track of the Oscar route is 177°. India Oscar check point is at 29°33' North latitude, 69°42' West longitude and the approximate position of the aircraft, approximately 50 miles west of India Oscar, is 29°33' North and 70°32' West.

3. The object according to the Flight Engineer involved, was a high intensity light to the right of the flight path which appeared to stand still for approximately four seconds until it was lost to sight during the evasive action. No object was indicated by the aircraft radar screen in that direction, according to the Engineer, although the radar was scanning over a 150 mile range.

4. The Copilot involved was engaged in making a

navigational loran fix at the time of the accident, accord-
ing to that crew member, and did not sight the object, nor
did the two cabin attendants.

5. Statements received from 17 of the 42 passengers
from which statements were requested indicated that all ex-
cept one were also led only to observe an object described as a Fireball traveling north. The awake
11 year old passenger indicated a sudden light with no direc-
tion or movement noticed. When other statements are received
they will be forwarded to be made attachments to this report.

6. Investigation revealed that the aircraft involved
and six other flights were on the way to San Juan over approx-
imately a 266 mile long sector of the Oscar route at the time
of the accident, as follows:

A.   PAWA Flight 215
B.   PAWA Flight 215A
C.   PAWA Flight 257
D.   PAWA Flight 257A
E.   PAWA Flight 261
F.   TransCaribbean Flight 600
G.   EAL Trip 839.

7. Two crew members of one of the six other flights
observed a similar object 145 hrs. earlier while at a
position 281 miles further north.

8. No person on board the flight nearest and approx-
imately 50 miles east of the flight involved, sighted the
object involved.

9. In addition to the sightings of the crew members
involved, a total of eight crew members on five of the six
other flights sighted the object involved, as follows:

I was awake looking through the window to my right when suddenly shortly before the plane bumped I saw a light, something that passed by very rapidly but I could not identify any particular thing. (It reminds me a room lighted suddenly out of deep darkness).

I cannot tell the direction of whatever produced the flare. The light was rather soft. It was like a light produced by the common electric bulbs. The whole thing passed like a flash.

(There was no service -- no courtesy -- nothing.
We were l ied at moronic. Told not to gel

April 26, 1957
DATE

Yes, I was a passenger on that fateful plane, I and would be
willing to say that no one saw anything. It had been pouring
rain when we left N.Y.C. and this was 3:30 N.Y. City time. The
plane was darkened and we were all asleep. When this terribly
lurch took place, everything on the plane (on luggage rack)
was thrown & hit my head on the rack above. No one bothered
to announce anything or explain anything. There was a general
feeling of panic on the plane. When the individual lights went
one, one at a time - some were donning their life jackets.
I felt the plane was out of control - when one hostess rushed by
I asked her & she didn't know (she said) & never exclaimed further.
After a good 10 min. an announcement was made: "I thought I
saw another plane in my path & swerved to avoid it." By then
no one had any confidence in that plane or pilot. No one
offered any further apologies or explanation when we left the
plane & no one slept all nite. I was thoroughly disgusted!

/s/ Marie W. Reddington
[Mrs. R. To.]

One engine gave out half way. This was announced after a
passenger noticed it. The body of the hostess lying in the
aisle was a dismal sight believe me!
