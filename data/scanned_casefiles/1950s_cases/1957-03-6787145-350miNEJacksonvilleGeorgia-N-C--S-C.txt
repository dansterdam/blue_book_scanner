STATEMENT

On 9 March 1957, at 0110 hours EST, I was copilot in a C-47 aircraft flying approximately 35 miles south of Columbia, South Carolina, at an altitude of 3,000 feet. At this time we sighted an object which was estimated to be 500 feet above our altitude and approximately 2-3 miles in the distance. The object was a fiery ball, round in color, with a white trail. As we approached to within 1 mile, the object remained stationary. Suddenly it started to speed up, and as it did so, the light was turned off. There were no exhaust or other means of propulsion visible, and the object seemed to cease to exist, leaving no trace.

STATEMENT

On the night of 6-7 March 1957, Captain Belmont (410t) and Major Landis (43rd CAB RESE) were flying a training flight from England AFB, Louisiana to the Eglin AFB, Florida, passing Allaire, 3 C., at approximately 0130 hours and canceled our IRR flight plan enroute to the Eglin AFB. Approximately 30 minutes later, our aircraft was illuminated by a yellowish-green fire with a brilliant tail with a length approximately 40-50 feet long. This fire did not cast any shadows on our aircraft. The fire completely surrounded our aircraft for approximately 15 to 20 seconds and then extinguished itself. Both the fire-ball and the tail appeared to be globes of fire appearing to break off and gradually die out at the time the fire extinguished itself. This phenomenon was observed by both of us at approximately the same time and our impression was that of an aerial phenomenon rather than a mechanical failure or malfunction of our aircraft. Weather conditions were 17,000 feet, visibility 15 to 20 miles with light ground haze. Stars visible, no clouds and no moon.

Flying time: 1:55 hours
2500 hours military flying
1000 hours fighter rating (F-84, F-33)
300 hours helicopter flying time
Witness: Landis (43rd CAB RESE)

Upon landing there was no evidence of any unusual phenomenon. They had reported a report of an unusual sighting.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0110, Saturday, March 2, 1957, I was riding in Captain Ingor's private airplane 350 miles northeast of Jacksonville, Florida, headed toward North South Carolina. The object entered my line of sight. The object, as an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 feet, appeared to be brown in color, and was estimated to be approximately 20 feet in diameter. It had a speed similar to a meteorite. The color was a dull green. It had a distinct glow, and appeared to be emitting sparks, but it did not appear to decrease in size as it came toward me. After passing within 30 feet of the wing, it appeared to be sparks emitting from the tail and immediately after a hood appeared, the object disappeared downward into the clouds. It did not appear to explode, however there were sparks in all directions. The return [sic] of the object as it disappeared was that of a meteor and it appeared to be traveling from a South West to North East direction. I had the feeling that the object was under intelligent control. The weather was clear, the object appeared about six feet in diameter and I heard no sound.

4. As stated, I was driving my automobile when I suddenly detected the objects from the far corner of my eyes. As I looked to the White at first I sight objects and then instinctively and automatically I looked up for a clearer view. They were just a split second or so from the first time I saw them to the time they disappeared from the firmament.

I watched as they passed almost a vertical course when I immediately spotted them. They were disappearing suddenly and nothing more was seen.

As related, I was driving my automobile When first sighting the objects. From the objects - I had no perspective from which to judge its distance from me and had no means by which to determine its size or it's, alhough as stated it appeared to be 6-8 feet in diameter. The flight was clear.

Text output:

At approximately 3 o'clock in the morning, the pilots
of an airliner from New York to Jacksonville, Fla. passed up and
over sharply to avoid colliding with a "brilliant greenish-
white object" that suddenly appeared in his path.  The
pilot and co-pilot described it as resembling a huge
glaring spotlight.  A number of passengers were injured
during the violent maneuver and requested hospitalization.
The fact that two other airliners approximately 175
miles away observed the object at the same time ruled out
aircraft and missiles.  This was later confirmed by all
military and civil agencies.  From a description given
by the crew and passengers who happened to see the object,
and from interrogation of the CAA and the Navy, the Center
concluded that the object was a seldom seen form of meteor,
a bolide, commonly referred to as a "fireball." The analysis
was independently reviewed and concurred with by a well-
known astrophysicist now with the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory.

Text from the document:

To whom it may concern:
Some months ago. a very strange object was seen in the vicinity of Jacksonville, Georgia - North Carolina - South Carolina area. This object was seen by a number of people and the description given by the witnesses was as follows:

The object was disc-shaped, approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter, and was observed from a distance of approximately 350 miles. Its speed was estimated to be between 600 to 800 miles per hour. The object had a distinctive glow or luminosity as it traveled through the sky. It made no sound and was seen for a period of several minutes.

The sighting was investigated by personnel from Project Blue Book and the information was included in their official report on unidentified flying objects. However, no photograph of the object was obtained due to the distance and speed at which it was observed.

Dear Sirs:

Before making my request, I had better tell you my official position. I am Professor and Chairman of the Astronomy Department of the University of Penna. From 1925-1955, when I had to retire by automatic rule, I was director of the Flower and Cook Observatories. I have a long record of research in astronomy on the university staff, and I arn well known to astronomers everywhere. 

Now as to my request. On 1957 March 15 at about 10 P.M. E.S.T., a very brilliant fireball was observed by many persons in the Gulf States region, probably S.W. of New Orleans, in or near the Gulf, from the Navy Dept. I have had many very circum stantial accounts from eyewitnesses, some of which seem very precise and important. These seem to me to be worthy of careful scientific analysis.

Further, as this was an astronomical body, with nothing mysterious about it, there can be no reason why reports should be classified or withheld from responsible scientists.

I most earnestly request you to have the reports on this event that may be in your files collated and made available to me, and I will be happy to communicate the results I obtain.

Ground during the most recent World War. I found the local commanders quite cooperative during the Second World War, and I hope I may have your cooperation in this instance.

Very sincerely yours,
(SIGNATURE REDACTED)

FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES

Major Lawrence J. Tacker, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
Office of Information Services 
Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker:

Many thanks for your reply of February 27 to my letter asking for possible reports on the great fireball of 1957 March 15 which crossed several of the Southern States and ended beyond New Orleans.

From the numerous press reports received on it and from our remarkable brilliancy and long duration, I gathered that many people would consider it a flying saucer-like object, and that the reports dealing with this fireball must have been numerous, some of the more remarkable cases perhaps worthy of special study.

With regard to two other fireballs you mention, I would indeed be glad to receive copies of reports in your hands. Often Hals are considered good reports, comparable in some ways to the more spectacular "flying saucers", and have on some occasions thrown light on possible ominous objects, and have several thousand fireballs in a card file. The Astrophysical Office of the U.S.Navy sends me copies of such reports from ships which I would be most happy if the Army and Air Force would do the same. As to not being able to get reports, due to classification, my good friend Dr. LIncoln LaPaz, of the University of New Mexico, has for some years gathered such reports for the military authorities. In his general report on the great New Mexico fireball of 1949 February 14, which was widely reported, he could get classified. Last year I made an attempt to secure them, aided by Col. D.M. Harrington, formerly of Air Force, but me I succeeded only in obtaining some key documents to refer to UFO, but was informed that no data was several orbits for such objects, which in my opinion are no doubt real products of scientific research.

And I hope that in time the value of careful study of such reports would be greatly appreciated and I hope we may some day secure copies for study and for scientific use.

Very sincerely yours,

The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report. It does not contain any photographs, but rather text describing a UFO sighting that occurred near Jacksonville, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina on March 6, 1957.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Another important incident had just been reported by Capt. Cecil D. McCreery, CAA-GCA Approach Control, JAX Approach Control office on the military frequency. (He was informed that this report was being sent to the Director of the AS, ATC, and to the Director of the ATIC, as well.)

According to Capt. McCreery's account, a CAA (FAA) pilot, Capt. Van Winkle, was flying at an altitude of 2000-3000 ft. along the South Carolina-Georgia coast at about 0500 Z, when he sighted an extremely bright object maneuvering around his aircraft. It first appeared as a brilliant green light, then "blinked out" - later reappearing as an extremely bright object with a dark silhouette. Capt. Van Winkle has reported this incident in detail, and stated that at one point the object came so close to his aircraft that he could feel the heat from it. It made a 90° turn and accelerated away at a terrific speed - disappearing from sight. He stated that the object was clearly larger than his twin-engine Beechcraft on which he was then flying. Capt. McCreery reported that Capt. Van Winkle seemed to be quite "shaken up" by this incident."

TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

Pan American Airliner Case
Still Unsolved, Says CAB

According to an Air Force spokesman's claim, 
on the night of March 13, 1957, two Pan American 
Airways pilots saw three unidentified objects in the 
air at an altitude of 21,000 feet near Jacksonville, 
Ga. The Civil Aeronautics Board, however, says the 
case is still unsolved. The Air Force claims the 
pilots saw three unknown objects maneuvering in a 
manner impossible for conventional aircraft. The 
pilots were traveling on an eastbound flight between 
Miami and New York. The CAB report states that the 
flight was cruising at 21,000 feet when the pilots 
observed three objects which they described as round 
in shape, white or green in color and of tremendous 
brightness. The objects maneuvered around the 
airplane for about 12 to 15 minutes. The pilots 
stated the objects were traveling at an estimated 
speed of 600 to 700 mph. This speed is far in excess 
of the capability of any known aircraft. The CAB 
report indicates that the Air Force conducted a very 
thorough investigation but was unable to identify 
the objects or explain the sighting. The case, 
therefore, remains unsolved. The CAB report gives no 
further details on this incident.

AF Accused of Hush-up on Saucers
PHILADELPHIA, APRIL 3
Air force senior officer in the Marine Corps accused the Air Force of "hushing up" the truth about unidentified flying objects, it was disclosed last night.
Donald E. Keyhoe, director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, said the officer, whom he did not name, will shortly tell the truth about the Air Force's policy of silence.
Keyhoe declared last night he will formally ask the Air Secretary this week to turn over to his org anization the project report on "flying saucers" which the Air Force has been steadfastly refusing to disclose.
Keyhoe said the officer told him the Air Force has possession of the project reports, and that the service has been "almost 20% certain" of the existence of interplanetary vehicles but has refused to admit this fact.
The committee, he said, intends to compel the Air Force to make public the information it has uncovered.
Keyhoe charged that the accused officer told him the public has never been told that Air Force jets have on many occasions tried unsuccessfully to intercept "flying saucers."
He also related he had a radar sighting between a jet and an object, and it was seen to "disappear". Neither the plane nor the object were ever seen again, Keyhoe said.

The article discusses how a pilot of an American Airlines flight took evasive action to avoid a flaming object while flying over Atlanta, Georgia. The article provides details about the incident, including the location, date, and some quotes from the pilot and passengers. However, there is no photograph visible in the image.

AIRLINER AVOIDS FLAMING OBJECT
Pilot Sends Plane into Steep Climb Over Atlanta—No Damage
SAN JUAN, P.R. March 6—(AP)—An American Airlines Constellation jet airliner was forced into a steep climb over Atlanta, Ga., Tuesday night to avoid a flaming object, according to the pilot's report.
Captain Matthew E. Van Winkle, Philadelphia, said the object appeared about 25 miles ahead and 1,000 feet below the airliner, which was flying at 17,000 feet on a run from New York to Miami.
He said the object seemed to be stationary, emitting a blue-white flame. Van Winkle said he threw the plane into a steep climbing turn to the right to avoid the object.
Passengers were reported to have been shaken up by the sudden maneuver, but no one was injured. The airliner landed safely in Miami.
Van Winkle said the object seemed to be stationary. He said it gave off a blue-white flame. The pilot said he threw the plane into a steep climbing turn to the right to avoid the object.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image in the provided document. The document consists entirely of text describing a UFO sighting incident.

Force Base in Florida said the object, which was no bigger than a plane, but shining like a star, first caught the pilot's attention.

Capt. Van Winkle said he and the co-pilot, Lt. J.W. Connelly, both saw the object, which was approximately 100 feet in diameter, flying along at an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 feet in a few seconds. The witnesses considered the object a very fast, fast-moving automatic device, but could not identify it. 

According to the document, three air force officers, Captain Van Winkle, Lt. J.W. Connelly, and Mrs. Abraham Gifford, a passenger, were hospitalized for treatment after the incident. The document states that the object was "unrecognizable" and that Captain Van Winkle described the sighting as a "bright light" that seemed to change in intensity. The document also mentions a "runaway missile" incident at Washington, Maryland, but states that the department had not received any report on that incident.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typewritten document describing an incident involving a "brilliant greenish-white object" that was observed by the crew and passengers of a Pan American Airlines flight from New York to Puerto Rico. The document mentions that the object was described as resembling a "huge glaring spotlight" and that two other airlines also observed the object at the same time. The analysis concludes that the object was a "seldom seen form of meteor, a bolide, commonly referred to as a 'firebolt'," based on the description provided by the crew and passengers.

Now, acting as an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

At approximately 3 o'clock in the morning, the pilot of an airliner from New York to Porto Rico, pulled up and over sharply to avoid colliding with a "brilliant greenish-white object" that suddenly appeared in his path. The pilot and co-pilot described it as resembling a huge glaring spotlight. A number of passengers were injured during the violent maneuvers and required hospitalization.

The fact that two other airlines approximately 175 miles away observed the object at the same time ruled out aircraft and missiles. This was later confirmed by all military and civil agencies. From a description given by the crew and passengers who happened to see the object, the Center concluded that the object was a seldom seen form of meteor, a bolide, commonly referred to as a "firebolt". The analysis was independently reviewed and concurred with by a well known astrophysicist now with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

The UFO Investigation
Still Unsolved, Says CAB

The Civil Aeronautics Board issued a report on an investigation by the CAB into a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object by the crew of an American airliner over the southeastern United States on March 6, 1957. The CAB report states that the object was seen for about 20 minutes and that the crew felt it was a real, solid object which was not a meteor, star, planet or aircraft. The CAB concluded that the object was not positively identified and the case was still unsolved.

The report states that at 8:15 PM on March 6, 1957, an American Airlines flight from Richmond, Virginia to Miami, Florida encountered an unidentified flying object about 350 miles northeast of Jacksonville, Florida. The object was first seen by the co-pilot and then observed by the pilot and two stewardesses on the flight. 

According to the report, the object appeared to be round, glowing, and was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 20 minutes and was estimated to be about 10-15 miles away from the aircraft. The object appeared to change color from red to orange to white during the observation period. 

The report states that the crew felt the object was a real, solid object that was not a meteor, star, planet or aircraft. The CAB investigation concluded that the object was not positively identified and the case remained unsolved.

Near midnight a GCA radar picked up unidentified targets
near the Oxnard AFB. At daylight, with searchlights playing on the sky,
nothing could be found. Some people at the AFB had seen the lights
pass over the field.
This did it, and two powerful jet equipped were unable
to find this. But if,—the so-called UFOs.

One of the most fantastic apparitions to confront a pilot is a group of luminous objects flashing through the air in more or less geometrical formation. The objects often seem to be heading directly toward the plane on a collision course but, as though under intelligent control, seem to veer off at the last possible instant and then disappear at incredible speed. The pilot usually recognizes this frightening phenomenon as an exploding meteor or a cluster of fireballs, though the sight is so extraordinary that he insists it could not have been a mere meteor but must have been some weird spaceraft. Airmen of unquestioned competence have made this mistake, sometimes because they "more than half-believe in extraterrestrial visitors, but more often because they know less than they suppose about meteors.

In trying to identify the alarming objects approaching his plane, the pilot often thinks first of a meteor, then rejects the idea with some form of the remark, "Whatever it was, it was certainly not a meteor." Whatever it was, it usually adds that no meteor could travel so fast (or so slow?) could have such a color, or meteor "obvious" that it was on a collision course. By as part of so orderly a group, move in so level (or so sharply angled) a path, maintain so steady a course, change course so abruptly, move so silently, or create so loud a detonation.

According to the document, the incident occurred on a Pan American flight from New York to San Juan early on the morning of March 9, 1957. At about 3:30 A.M., when the plane was off Jacksonville, Florida, the pilot and the flight engineer saw a burning, greenish-white, round object coming out of nowhere, seemingly only a half mile away and headed across their nose on a direct collision course. In a violent evasive move the pilot put the plane into a climb of about 1,500 feet, during which several passengers were injured. The document states that the crews of at least seven other flights within an area of 300 miles were reporting the same objects. One witness saw it split in two and the fiery rear section drop away. About an hour earlier, the pilot of another plane in the area had seen the breakup of a similar meteor but had not reported it. In spite of all the evidence that the unknown was a normal meteor, breaking apart as many meteors do, the Pan American pilot, "having seen thousands of meteors," could not accept the object as a natural phenomenon although he did realize after he heard the other reports, that he had greatly underestimated its distance. Although the object showed all the characteristics of a typical fireball, the flying saucer enthusiasts have tried to convert this undoubted meteor into an "unknown object".

OBJECT: PLANE CRAFT VERSUS JET AIRCRAFT, AS TOLD TO THE NEW YORK JOURNAL-AMERICAN OF THE PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS PILOT WHO SIGHTED A COLLISION BETWEEN A LUMINOUS FLYING OBJECT THAT VEERED INTO HIS PATH.

EARLY CAPTION: "IT PRECEDED BY 200 YARDS FROM ME VERY SHARPLY SATURATED. IT was DISTRIBUTED BY INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICE IT LOOKS LIKE A MOST DUN HUNDRED YARDS, BUT AS TO WHAT IT WAS, I HAVE LESS AN IDEA TODAY THAN WHAT IT REALLY BEFORE TRIED TO EVADE AND HIGH SPEED IT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT.

"IT" WAS LACONICALLY DESCRIBED AS A UFO- "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT" IN A RADIO REPORT RELAYED TO EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE HEADQUARTERS BY A CIVIL AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER WHICH MONITORED THIS REPORT. TASK FORCE, ACCOMPANIED BY A RADAR PLANE, WAS SENT ALOFT TO INVESTIGATE. FROM A STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND FIGHTER BASE IN THE SOUTH, IT ANY ARE CLASSIFIED.

SIMILAR SIGHTINGS IN THE PAST HAVE LATER BEEN EXPLAINED WHEN SEEN THROUGH AN ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING, AT WHICH TIMES "MIRAGES" HAVE BEEN OBSERVED.

TO BE ALTITUDE 15,000 FOOT ALTITUDE, WHICH COULD HAVE MADE IT APPEAR LARGER THAN IT REALLY WAS.

IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE A BIT SPOTLIGHT SHINING CLEARLY IN THE DARK-SEEMING CLOUDINESS, AND AS I KNOW IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

HE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT IT, SPOTTED IT THE SAME INSTANT HE DID, THAT IS HEAR HIS BREATH BY CO-PILOT. READING ON INSTRUMENTS SHOWED THAT IT WAS GOING FASTER THAN HIS PLANE.

AS YOU HAVE PERHAPS A SECOND BEFORE. IT WAS BEWILDERED, BY REFLEX AND INSTANTLY-OF PASSENGER SAFETY IN YOUR HANDS. BE PREPARED SOMETHING LIKE THIS:
THROUGH PERIODIC RADIO REPORTS INTERCEPTED MUST BE ERRONEOUS. I HAD THOUGHT OF JETS BY REFLEX BECAUSE HERE UNUSUAL FROM A JET EXHAUST PROBABLY IS RULE OUT AN INTERCEPT AGAIN IN THE SAME SPLIT SECOND IT RULED OUT AN INTERCEPT BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS COME AT LEAST 20 MILES SOME PULLING ALONGSIDE OF YOU READY FOR ACTION, THE OTHER THROWING A SPOTLIGHT ON YOUR IDENTIFICATION MARKINGS AND FLASH OUT WHO YOU ARE.

THIS REPORTING ROUTE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THESE BLUNDERS FROM BECOMING A DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONE, WHICH STRETCHES MILES OUT TO SEA, IS NOT AFTER REASONING THIS OUT, I FELT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING FOR ME TO DO TO SAVE 55 PASSENGERS AND CREW, THAT WAS TO PULL UP SHARPLY.

I HAD BEEN ON INSTRUMENT LIGHT UNTIL MINUTES BEFORE I SAW THE OBJECT, AND IT WAS PITCH BLACK OUTSIDE. I WAS IN ROUTINE COMMUNICATION WITH FIVE OTHER PAN AMERICAN PLANES, AN EASTERN AIRLINES PLANE CARRYING A TRANS-CARIBBEAN PLANE TAIL OF WHICH WERE HEADED FOR NEW YORK AT THE TIME.

1. Reference is made to conversation between General Watson and the undersigned, dated 12 March 1957, pertaining to a query by General Samford.

2. In compliance with the Commander's request for some immediate, positive action with respect to this matter, priority messages requesting immediate investigations and/or conclusive details have been submitted to the following:

a. Comdr, 4602d AISS, ADC
b. Comdr, Hqs, SAC
c. Comdr, Hqs, USAF
d. Capt, P. BLACP
e. Dept of Naval Operations, Dept of the Navy

3. ATTACKED INS teletype indicates all the above, with the exception of the 4602d AISS, may be directly or indirectly involved.

4. In compliance with the Commander's personal instructions, every effort will be made to have some conclusions or answer on his desk by 1800 hours, Thursday, 14 March. Necessary deviations to SAC organizations, as an example, may cause delay in accomplishing this.

5. Dr. Hynek, UFO project consultant, is flying to Dayton, and will arrive on the morning of this date. His contributions and review of the case should be of value to the over-all analysis.

There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. The image shows a Joint Message Form with details about a UFO sighting by a Pan American World Airways pilot on March 57, 1957 somewhere along the Atlantic seaboard. The exact time and location of the incident are unknown. The incident was given wide publicity through TV, radio, and the press release. The document requests any information or comments regarding this matter to be provided to the center by noon on March 14, 1957 in order to meet a HQ USAF deadline.

April 26, 1957 
I was awake looking through the window to my right when suddenly shortly before the plane bumped I saw a light, something that passed by very rapidly by could not identify any particular thing. (It reminds me a room lighted suddenly out of deep darkness).
I cannot tell the direction of whatever produced the flare. 
The light was rather soft. It was like a light produced by a common electric bulb. The whole thing passed like a flash.

Yes, I was a passenger on that fateful plane. I and would be willing to say that no one saw anything. It had been raining when we left N.Y.C. and this was 3:30 N.Y. city time. The plane was darkened and we were all asleep. When this terrible lurch took place, everything on the plane (our luggage rack) was thrown & hit my head on the rack above. No one bothered to announce anything or explain anything. There was a general feeling of panic on the plane. When the individual lights went out, one, one at a time - some were donning their life jackets.

I felt the plane was out of control - when one hostess rushed by I asked her & she didn't know (she said) & never explained further. After a good 10 min. an announcement was made: "I thought I saw another plane in my path & swerved to avoid it." By then no one had any confidence in that plane or pilots. No one offered any further apologies or explanation when we left the plane & no one slept all nite. I was thoroughly disgusted.

One engine gave out half way. This was announced after a passenger noticed it. The "body of the hostess" lying in the aisle was a dismal sight believe met.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

April 26, 1957
I did not observe an unidentified flying object -
and the weather conditions were good. I did think 
the information given the passengers was very
inadequate - and the care of some was very poor.

In answer to your questions - there was nothing unusual about our flight before a sudden maneuver except for bad weather up until an hour, or less, before we were thrown upwards - I did not observe the object which caused the pilot to out the plane into a steep climb - One engine was not working after this encounter - or maybe this was the case before the sudden climb.

The letter is signed by Ivan Rodriguez and provides his address. The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sirs:

I was in that plane that almost crashed with the thing they say was something like a ball of fire.

I thank God for the sake of all the passengers like me came alive. What you like to know I tell you I did see nothing because I was sleep but after believe me I cry all the way home.

Very truly yours,
