3. DATE-TIME GROUP: GMT 12/16277

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. SOURCE: Civilian

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 4-5 seconds

7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

8. COURSE: SE

9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Silver object, shape of isosceles triangle, base approx 1/2 to 1/3 as long as legs of triangle, could be covered by golf ball held at arms' length. Small vapor trail. Attn drawn by its high speed, which source described as twice as fast as F-100 series a/c.

11. COMMENTS: Probably a/c with illusion of greater speed due to effects of trying to observe fast moving objects through a sky half covered with clouds and early morning sun's slant rays intercepting between a/c and clouds.

(8) Any other unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting: None.

(9) Interception or identification action taken: 616th AROW Squadron at Foster Air Force Base, Texas reports negative traffic, of characteristics mentioned in this report, in area at time of sighting of object.

(10) Location of area of traffic in the area at time of sighting: Unknown number of BOAC aircraft in area at time of sighting. No pilot reports of unusual air activity received by this organization.

(11) Position title and comments of the preparing officer, including his preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting:

Object possibly F-102 aircraft as wing platform shape approximates that of the F-102. High rate of speed as reported by observer possibly due to low altitude of object. Tight turn and rapid rate of climb appear super-characteristic of known USAF occasional aircraft.

Preparing officer holds position of Wing Intelligence Officer of this organization.

(12) Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: None.
