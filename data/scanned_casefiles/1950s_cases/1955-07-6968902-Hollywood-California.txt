II. RELIABILITY:
    Poor. During a personal interview, Mr. DeLong spoke of having
    once reported a sighting which turned out to be a pelican
    flying over. He seemed to be satisfied and placed importance
    on reporting everything without enough forethought, as was
    evident in errors in giving observation time and size of
    object in his original report.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was on duty at the Hollywood Ground
    Observation Post at the time of the sighting (0900-15% July 55).
    The night was clear, dark, dry and cool, with a slight breeze
    blowing. There was no moon and many stars were out. A single
    object was observed for a period of three (3) to four (4) sec-
    onds. This is contrary to Source's original report, which
    stated that a second sighting.

    A. The object did not appear to stand still nor suddenly
       speed up and rush away at any time. The object faded out at
       its disappearance. The object appeared overhead at approxiate-
       ly 70 to 80 degrees from the horizon to the north, and traveled
       to the north, fading out of view at 50 to 70 degrees, and
       behind any object.

    B. Source changed the original estimate of size in his
       initial report from that of a silver dollar to that of a dime
       held in the hand at arm's length. Source does not wear glasses
       and did not use any visual aids for this sighting.

    C. Source believed this sighting to be a meteor.
