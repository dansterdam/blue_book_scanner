Most of the text on this page is illegible. I can make out some very faint text on the left side of the page that appears to be a list with numbers, but the text is too blurry to read with certainty. The document appears to be a black and white scanned page with a vertical line of holes or punch marks on the right side of the page.


- page 2 -

The image appears to be a scanned document page with very faint and mostly illegible text. The only clearly visible text is the number "51123" in the upper right corner of the page. The rest of the text is too faint or blurry to be accurately transcribed.
