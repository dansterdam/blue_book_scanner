The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report with text describing some kind of observation or event.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"THESE SMALL RED COLORED CLOUDS WERE OBSERVED TO MANEUVER VERY ERRATICALLY OVER THE ARCTIC ICE FIELD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. THE CLOUDS DISPERSED RAPIDLY AFTER REMAINING STATIONERY FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. THE CLOUDS APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 150 FEET IN DIAMETER AND WERE OBSERVED BY LOOKOUTS ON THE DECK OF THE SHIP. THE CLOUDS WERE A BRIGHT RED COLOR AND MAINTAINED THEIR SHAPE WHILE MANEUVERING. THEY WERE OBSERVED THROUGH BINOCULARS AND IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE WERE NO TRAILS OF SMOKE OR CONDENSATION VISIBLE BEHIND THE CLOUDS AS THEY CHANGED DIRECTION RAPIDLY. THE CLOUDS APPEARED LEVEL AS THEY MOVED AND THERE WERE NO REFRACTIVE EFFECTS NOTED. FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE GIVEN IF ANY OFFICERS HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS."
