SUMMARY: (Conclusion of report. Last sentence of paragraph 2.) In accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects.

On 29 January 1953 between the hours 22.25 GST and 22.48 GST the above mentioned personnel observed two unidentified objects in the sky over Grand Island, Nebraska, at an altitude of 9,000 feet on a true heading of 270 degrees and at a ground speed of approximately 700 knots. These objects were observed when they were over Grand Island and were subsequently observed to be between 2,000 and 3,000 feet above Grand Island, Nebraska.

Contacts were made with the following ground stations: Grand Island, Lexington, North Platte, Nebraska. An unidentified object was reported by radio on Channel 16-1240 and R-47 9521, flying at 29,000 feet, was contacted. This object was considered unidentified.

Lt. Dooley, who first noticed the phenomena, the light appeared instantaneously and changed color from white to red to green and then disappeared after operating for approximately 8 minutes.

CONCLUDED BY LT. DUNLAY: Pilot C-47 aircraft:
"There was a flight of very high-speed, high altitude aircraft. I estimate the speed to be somewhere between 600-800 M.P.H. I was flying at 5,000 feet when I called Grand Island and requested clearance to change my course and climb as I was unable to maintain position to observe these aircraft. The time was about 22:00 local time. The object appeared to be illuminated as they were much brighter than the average star. I estimate the size of these objects to be between 30-50 ft. in diameter. The objects maneuver when I called Grand Island and received clearance to climb. When I reached 10,500 ft. the objects had disappeared from my sight. My mind was only a pilot flying that much higher would not be able to observe the objects if they were to appear, as they seemed to disappear almost instantly. I can say with certainty that these objects were not any known type of aircraft or satellite, and they were maneuvering in an unexplained manner. The objects appeared to be circular in shape and seemed to be illuminated within as there was no outer shell or boundary that one could observe. The subject appeared to be very strange and unconventional and does not compare to any known type of aircraft or satellite."
AT THAT TIME, I CONTACTED GRAND ISLAND AGAIN AND ASKED THEM AT WHAT POINTS THEY HAD AIRCRAFT IN THE AIR BUT THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ON ANY AIRCRAFT FLYING AT THAT TIME. I ASKED HIM TO CHECK OUTSIDE AND CHECK A LIGHT THAT WAS OVER GRAND ISLAND. HE STATED HE WOULD CHECK AND GET BACK TO ME BUT HE NEVER DID. THIS WAS SOMETIMES LATER, AFTER 3-5 MINUTES LATER, THE OBJECTS HAD DISAPPEARED FROM MY SIGHT. THIS CONCLUDES MY OFFICIAL REPORT ON THIS INCIDENT. I HAVE GONE OVER IT CAREFULLY AND IT IS MY HONEST AND SINCERE OPINION THAT WHAT I SAW WERE OBJECTS OR VEHICLES OF SOME KIND THAT ARE UNCONVENTIONAL IN THEIR METHOD OF FLIGHT AND PERFORMANCE AND CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED 

25 Apr 53, Colo. Springs, Colo.

Grand Island watched to contact Commercial Flight 603, westbound, they would like to talk to him on certain Grand Island also told us that a B-47 from their base was nearby their airspace. Grand Island lost contact with the B-47 at the same time it lost contact with the Commercial flight. 

We lost sight of it about 2:43 CST. It was my impression that it was looking through any haze at the The engineers. Cpl Wanyer, repeated that the target had been seen to get lower and lower until it disappeared completely and very dim.

The object was found at Grand Island. They marked on the phenomena of the lights changing any manner. The object remained in view through the operation and was losing altitude, finally it could no longer be seen. 

I asked Grand Island if they could contact the cadets to see if they could verify flight. They said he could not contact the cadets - they were apparently all alright at Lowry.
