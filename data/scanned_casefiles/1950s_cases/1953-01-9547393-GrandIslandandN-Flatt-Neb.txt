Object was first observed when the aircraft's was over Grand Island, Nebraska by entities near and the object appeared to be between 20° and 30° above the horizon and over Grand Island, Nebraska.

Contacts were made with the following ground stations: Grand Island, Lexington and North Platte, Nebraska. All ground stations reported by radio to aircraft that the object was west of them. Commercial Flight 609, westbound was contacted on Channel D-Delta and B-47/0211, flying at 39,000 feet, was contacted, however neither could see the object reported upon.

Statement by Lt. Dooley, Pilot C-47 aircraft:

There was a high haze, a very light, high cirrus around 25,000 to 30,000 feet; it was a bright moonlit night. Stars were third to best. We were approximately 15 minutes out of Grand Island, Nebraska when I called Grand Island and received approval to make our approach. We got at up Llauding to the range, with Lt. Baker under the hood flying instruments. At the time I received clearance for our approach, a bright light appeared to be over Grand Island. My first impression was that somebody had turned on a landing light so aircraft coming that way would try to attract attention. While I was looking this thing I chartered a change color. The first time it was just a brilliant white, changed to pale blue and then to light amber then a reddish rose and finally to white. The object appeared to cover a regular cycle on these undulating colors. I brought it, Baker's attention to it, then Capt. Tressell and the engineer's. We were all watching it. On the object and its apparent size, as compared to a dime on the windshield from the pilot's seat and the dime just about covered the object. There was no trail apparent.

At that time I contacted Grand Island and asked them at what points they had a view of the sky. He said he had east and northeast glass in his tower. I asked him to check outside and check a light that was over Grand Island. He said he was just a little bit above the horizon and west. So I asked him if he would check it in North Platte and see if they had the thing in sight. This was sometime later - 7 or 8 minutes later. North Platte on first line, north Platte said the thing was just of them. Hastings on almost line, also west 30 miles. North Platte said it had gone out of sight. We still had it in sight.

North Platte weather station took a heliodite shot of it on the First sighting, and it appeared to be circular. There was some reading (all shey said was they had observed it through a heliodite). After that they had notified Lowry. The thing was apparently half-way between Denver and Grand City, so I told them to notify Flight Service, thinking it might be intercepted from Rapid City.

Grand Island wanted us to contact Commercial Flight 609, westbound, they would like to talk to us on D-Deals. Grand Island also told us that a B-47 (15 0211) flying at 3,000 feet could not sight the object. No was others going to Thunk or was from Durpack. We could see this vapor trails. He was about 100 miles south of us. We could still see the thing, but the B-47 pilot could not. Venus was just above the horizon. When we contacted Flight 609 pilots, had gone out of sight but the pilot said yes, they had seen it. It was a very bright light, and they said it was a very bright light.

We got some information from the pilot. Three nights before they took off in Chicago, same flight, they had the same impression that it was blinking a landing light. The pilot, Ray Cooke (spelling uncertain) said he followed it a long time that night. I didn't argue with him. I just got his impression. He said he was here at the right time you can see it almost any time. He said he had seen similar things several times.

We got back here at 1225, I think, and they had a CAM flight that came in from Des Moines or somewhere, and he said that it was just as they saw it every case in another week was that time of night. So we just agreed with him that that was it.

I studied astronomy for two years; I've seen Venus before. I have about 1650 hours pilot time; Capt Tressel, 2500 hours; Lt Baker about 650 hours, the engineer 200 or 250 hours. Lt Dooly has about 350 hours of pilot time flying in the last two years.

We didn't change our course. The object remained directly in front of the aircraft.

We were flying Green 3 Airway from Omaha to North Platte; and Blue 36 from North Platte to Akron, Colorado.

We lost sight of it about 9:43 CST. It was an impression that it was terribly bright. It was so bright that anything we could see through it. If anything, it was below this haze or no markers we were lifting. It appeared to be below some haze layer or haze bank or else haze layer before we got to North Platte. The object was out of sight by then. We didn't appear to be looking through any haze at it. The engineers, Cpl DeKuyper, remarked he never saw a long light that big on an airplane.

The time it went out of sight at North Platte, it was quite a distance from us. It must have been at least 100 miles from North Platte. This thing was approximately 10 degrees to the left of our position, and when it went out of sight it was maybe 5 or 10 degrees to the right. It covered an azimuth angle of about 20 degrees. The object was lost and it appeared to have dipped below the horizon, but shortly thereafter was noticed several times to reappear momentarily and vary dim.

The people on the ground at Grand Island said the color was changing. They remarked on the phenomena of the lights changing. They never said anything about the size. The object appeared in my angular coverage of vision instantaneously and came on just like something turning on a light.

I asked Grand Island if they could contact Goodland to see if they could pick it up on radar. He said he didn't have any contact with them; he would notify Flight Service at Omaha.
