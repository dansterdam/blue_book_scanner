Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], Batavia, Ohio. Having first learned of the sighting from Mrs. [redacted], an employee in the advertising department at the Omaha Co., of which I am manager, I asked for more detailed information.

On Sunday, Oct. 14, 1956 at about 6:30 pm, while traveling east on U.S. highway 52, between Ripley and New Richmond, Ohio, I saw a reddish orange object in the sky. At first I thought it was a jet trail, but the trail didn't seem to get any larger, in fact it all seemed to be traveling at the same speed, and, in a northerly direction for at least a minute then it turned straight up and disappeared out of sight.

When the object turned it did not make an arc but made a sharp turn like this.

The whole thing seemed to turn at once time. A jet would have had a curve to its turn but this did not. My wife and son were with me at the time. They saw the driving, and I did not take my eyes off it until it was out of sight. They all saw it.

Mr. [redacted] (and wife) from Ft. Thomas, Ky. Object sighted in Northeast at about 1:20 pm. Mr. [redacted] described the object as being about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. It was metal gray and without apparent wings or tail or other appendages. As said the object appeared to be stationary for about a minute, and was quite low.

Thus, in brief, are the descriptions of the UFO's seen by three separate groups on October 14, plus the photographs. I hope they may prove to be of value to you and your command.

Amidst the international crisis, I hope that I may be able to serve your command more thoroughly and expeditiously. I have not yet phoned Lt. Colonel U. S. Green in Washington in regard to the matter discussed by phone on October 6, 1956. I believe a phone call would only add to the confusion already existing as to my status. I might try by letter, however, hoping that clarification might be possible.

Sincerely

P.S. Please return the enclosed photographs and negatives to the writer after analysis as [redacted] then in my responsibility.

Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects

November 7, 1956

Captain G. L. Gregory
AFISC
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Captain Gregory:

Enclosed herewith are three photographs taken by the citizens of Hill, Cincinnati, Ohio, which may be of interest to your command. Mr. [redacted], telephone number is as follows: He is an employee of the local General Electric Co., and told the writer that he was very much interested in astronomy, particularly lunar studies. He is at present, interested in astronomy, particularly lunar studies. He is in contact with members of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society. According to Mr. [redacted] (with whom I talked), the photographs were taken through his telescopes. Mr. [redacted] cannot say of any kind of lens, nor was he able to say unusual lights in the sky. However, through powerful magnification an object appearing visually as a pinpoint of light, may show up as photographed. Hailed out were Newton ring phenomena.

Mr. [redacted] told the writer that he photographed the "object" while taking a series of shots of the moon. He has many times spoken to the writer of his interest in the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was not faked. On candid camera, he seeks no publicity. He also gave me permission to contact your command regarding the photographs. In any contact Mr. [redacted] for additional information regarding these photographs, write or call.

The photographs taken by Mr. [redacted] were taken on Sunday, October 14, 1956. CRIFO received three daytime sightings of UFO's from three separate groups of witnesses in the Greater Cincinnati area.

In Covington, Kentucky about 1 p.m., Mr. [redacted] said the sky was deep blue, and while driving in traffic, he saw large white lights that appeared the size of full moon. He said the object was stationary. By the time he had reached the next block, which afforded a visual clearing of the sky, the object had disappeared. Mr. [redacted] said that the object was unusually brilliant and large. He filed out reflection on aircraft as an explanation. Mr. [redacted] has a pilot's license.
