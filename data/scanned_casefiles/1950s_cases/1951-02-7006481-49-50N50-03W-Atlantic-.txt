MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE
Subj:  Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

At 0052 on 10 February 1951, while serving as second Plane Commander on above Flight, I was an eye witness to an unusual sighting of an unidentified object. This occurrence took place at approximately 24°50 N and 50-03 W, which is approximately 200 miles north east of Argentia, Newfoundland. We were at 10,000 feet altitude cruising on a true course of about 230° at time of incident.

At time of sighting I was occupying the right hand (CoPilots) seat and the left hand (Pilots) seat was occupied by Lieutenant G. E. BETHUNE.

My attention was first called to the occurrence by Mr. BETHUNE, who asked me to look at an unusual light which was to my right. I then saw that there was a glowing light beneath a thin layer of strato-form clouds beneath us. This light was to my right and down at an angle of about 45°. This object apparel to lie on the surface and was throwing a yellowish-orange glare through the cloud deck. It appeared to be very large and I at first thought that it could be a large ship completely illuminated.

Mr. BETHUNE and I watched the object for several minutes in trying to determine its nature. We then called our Navigator, Lieutenant N. J. P. ROGER to the cockpit to scrutinize the object and render his opinion as to its nature.

While further observing the object I saw that it suddenly started ascending through the cloud layer and it then became quite bright. The object was very large and was driving yellow-orange ring around its outer edge. This object appeared to be climbing and moving at a tremendous speed, and it appeared to be on a more or less collision course with our aircraft. When it appeared that the area of possible collision of the object appeared to make a 180° turn and disappeared over the horizon at a terrific speed. During the course of events LTJG A. L. JONES had come to the cockpit and he made a turn in the direction of the object but it went out of sight in a short period of time.

Due to the fact that this object was seen over water at night it would be most difficult for me to estimate speed, size or distance we were from it during the course of events. However, the speed was tremendous and the size was at least 200 to 300 feet in diameter. The object was close enough to be seen and observed clearly.

MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9, February 1951

1. At 00552, 10 February 1951, I was the Plane Commander of Flight 125/09 
R5D Bureau Number 56501, enroute from Keflavik, Iceland to Argentina, 
Newfoundland at 10,000 feet on an instrument flight plan. Our position 
at 10/0552 was 49-50 North, 50-03 West, on a true heading of 230°, ground 
speed 113 knots. The weather was clear with about 60 miles visibility and 
thin stratus clouds at about 4,000.

2. I was in the cabin checking the passengers when one of the 
navigators, Lieutenant M. J'J P. KOGER, came aft and pointed to this 
phenomena. I watched it for a minute and went forward to the cockpit to get 
a better view. Upon reaching the cockpit, I took the plane off of the auto-
pilot and turned to a true heading of 290° in pursuit of the object. The 
object left on a heading of about 290° true and went over the horizon in a 
very short time.

3. I would guess the speed to be well over 1500 miles per hour, and the 
diameter to be at least 300 feet.

4. My first view of it resembled a huge fiery orange disc on its edge. 
As it went further away, the center became darker, but the edge still threw 
off a fiery hue. When it went over the horizon, it seemed to go from a 
vertical position to a horizontal position, with only the trailing edge 
showing in a half-moon effect. Since I was not the first to see it, it was 
going away from the plane when I was notified. Copilot Lieutenant G. E. 
BERGHAUS was flying the plane and Second Plane Commander Lieutenant Fred 
KINGDON was flying on the right side at the time of the incident.

5. At 10/0242, I called Candor Tower on VHF and asked then if Candor 
A. F. C. had any information of an aircraft at that position and time. They 
had no such information and notified the military of our sighting. When 
we landed at Argentina at 10/0240, we were interrogated by Capt. D. H. 
PAULSEN, USAF, Pepperall AFB, and CDR NEMOYTH, C.O., VP-3, Argentina. The 
extreme speed, maneuverability, and brilliance of the object made our 
estimates as to the distance and size very difficult.

MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

1. I was navigator on flight 125/09 from Keflavik, Iceland to NAS, Argentina.

2. At approximately 0050/10 February 1951, I was reporting our position and ETA Argentina to the Pilot, Lieutenant KINGDOM. At that time we were on a turn heading of 230°, true air speed 190 knots, and a ground speed of 120 knots due to a 70 knot headwind.

3. Lieutenant KINGDOM pointed out an orange colored object about 0600 relative, or 290°, saying it appeared 11k or a small village or a ship. Due to our position, I was certain it wasn't a village.

4. I had been looking at the object about thirty seconds, which it appeared to me was another demonstration of the "northern lights" phenomena which occur at that latitude, when the object suddenly started getting much brighter, taking on shape and coming in our direction at a great rate of speed. Before getting a good view of the object, I left the cockpit to inform LT JG JONES. Due to the crowded cockpit, I did not get another look.

5. The best view I had of the object showed it to be a circular, bright orange-red disc, which was approaching us at a very great, undeterminable speed.

MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE
Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

I, Graham E. BETHUNE, was Co-Pilot on Flight 125 from Keflavik, Iceland to Naval Air Station, Argentina on the 10th of February 1951. At 0055Z

While flying in the left seat at 10,000 feet on a true course of 230 degrees at a position of 49-50 North 50-03 West, I observed a glow of light high in the horizon about 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the water. Its bearing was about 2 O'Clock. There was no overcast, there was a thin transparent group of scuds at about 3,000 feet altitude. After examining the object for 40 to 50 seconds I called the attention of Lieutenant KINGDOM in the right hand seat. It was under the thin scuds at roughly 30 to 40 miles away. I asked "What is it, the ship lighted up or a city, I know it can't be a city because we are over 250 miles out." No both observed its course and motion for about 4 or 5 minutes before calling it to the attention of the other crew members. Its first glow was a dull yellow. We were on an interesting course. Suddenly its angle of attack changed, its altitude and size increased as though its speed was in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. It closed in so fast that the first feeling was we would collide in mid air. At this time its angle changed and the color changed. It then was definitely circular and reddish orange on its primitive. It reversed its course and tripled its speed until it was last seen disappearing over the horizon. Because of our altitude and misleading distance over water it is almost impossible to estimate its size, distance and speed. A rough estimate would be at least 300 feet in diameter, over 1,000 miles per hour in speed and approached within 5 miles of the aircraft.

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

On February 10, 1951, enroute from Keflavik, Iceland to Argentina, Newfoundland as a crew member on Flight 125 a strange sight was witnessed by Lieutenant KINGDOM and Lieutenant BENNE who were piloting the aircraft' at the time. I had left the cockpit approximately 1 hour prior to this sighting. The time of the sighting was 00552 and the position of the aircraft was 49°-50N Lat and 50-03W Longitude. I was called to the cockpit by Lieutenant KINGDOM to witness this scene.

When I first saw the sight it was far away from us and rapidly disappearing over the horizon. Not being too familiar with flying in this particular area my first impression was the celestial setting of the moon and the fact that stratus layers were present to cause the bright red glow and the halo effect that was apparent.

I did not witness the entire proceedings as did some of the other pilots, but from what little I did see of it this was the impression I received. The object disappeared on a true course of approximately 290°.

I When Flight NN125 departed Keflavik, Iceland for Argentla, Newfoundland
I had the first radio watch for the first 5½ hours. After being
relieved of the watch by Reed, M. E., ALC I went aft in the Passenger
Compartment and went to sleep. After being asleep for awhile I heard
someone say something about an object on something to the starboard of the
aircraft. I raised my head to the window and saw a round object which to
me looked like it was round with a color of fire. I didn't see it only
for a few seconds then it was gone.

We were off the coast of Newfoundland about 2 hours on flight 125 from Iceland on the 9th of February 1951, when I went forward to find out if the pilots or crew would like any coffee, soda, or etc. When I entered the cockpit, compartment the co-pilot, compartment called my attention to a light at about 2 O'Clock and slightly lower than us. It looked very much like an eclipse of the sun, which was about three-fourths of total eclipse, in size, shape, and color, but the speed of the light must have been at least 520 knots. It not more. The distance the light seemed to be was from three-quarters to a mile away. At that time Mr. JONES came forward and I went aft with the passengers.

From: Dir/Int, Hq NEAC
Report No: TR-6-51
Page 2 of 2

1. The following described unidentified aircraft/object was sighted off the coast of Newfoundland by MATS Navy C-54 crew.

a. Originally sighted as a single, heavy, yellowish light, similar in appearance to that of a city. As object approached observers, it grew very bright and large, and appeared to be semi-circular in shape. Near aircraft, it did a 180° turn and was last seen as a small ball disappearing over the horizon. The speed was "terrific" and the size "tremendous" to quote observers. The difference in size between the time it was first seen and last seen as a small ball going over the horizon was described as tremendous, at least 100 times larger.

b. Sighted at 05552 on 10 February 1951 and remained visible for approximately 7 or 8 minutes.

c. Visually observed from MATS Navy C-54 #6501 of VR-1 Squadron based at Patuxant, Maryland, flying at 10,000 feet altitude, 172 knots air speed, 225° true course.

d. Observing aircraft was at 49° 50' N 50° 30' W at the time of observation. Object appeared near the water's surface at approximately a 45° downward angle from the observing aircraft and was making good a course of approximately 125°. Upon approaching, observing aircraft, it executed a sudden turn approximating 180° and disappeared very rapidly over the horizon.

e. Object sighted by 5 crew members, listed below, of the above aircraft, who are all experienced North Atlantic fliers. Calder Traffic Control reports no other aircraft known to be in the vicinity at time of sighting. All 6 observers agree on facts as stated, but there has been no confirmation from other sources. Believe C-53 appropriate.

Lt Fred W. Kingston - 173390 (first to see object)
Lt A. L. Jones - 381096
Lt G. E. Parsons - 239055
Lt N. G. P. Roger - 308875
Lt J. M. Meyer - 263836

f. Weather clear, visibility from 15 miles to unlimited, no other weather information available.

g. No unusual meteorological activity known to exist and having any influence on the sighting. This object could not have been a comet as the object was below and between the aircraft and ocean.

h. No physical evidence available.

i. No interception action taken.

2. The above information was forwarded from this Headquarters to Headquarters, USAF by Msg, MATS HQ 10 February 1951 by TWX at 1615.
