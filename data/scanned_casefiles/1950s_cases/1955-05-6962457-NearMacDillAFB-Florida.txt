Observer believed he saw "flying saucer" in form of large square glow in sky approximately two miles away and 30,000 feet high. Object was orange and was making ninety degree turns. Last he saw of it was heading straight up.

11. COMMENTS
Due to delay in receiving initial report and lack of information contained therein, no investigation authorized. Fact that obj was seen at night & fact that it could turn at ninety angles, indicates possibility of searchlight activity. Objects appearance as "a large square glow in sky" seems to confirm searchlight activity as cause.
