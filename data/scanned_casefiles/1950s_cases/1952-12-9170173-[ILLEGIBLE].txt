AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Laredo Air Force Base, Texas       ATRC IR-M-52       PAGE 2 of 3 PAGES

On 12 December 1952, a civilian pilot of an F-86D jet interceptor type aircraft was flying on a routine training mission from Laredo Air Force Base, Texas. The purpose of the mission was practicing "Airstarts" for the pilots returning to base. After completing the exercised, the pilot was returning to his base.

At approximately 1720, while waiting for permission from the tower to land, the pilot observed a rapidly moving bluish-white light in the southwestern sky. The pilot stated that the light appeared to be over the residential area, directly southwest of the base. As the object approached, the pilot could see that it was luminous and seemed to be moving at a very high rate of speed. The light appeared to be over the base for a matter of seconds only, and then shot away toward the southwest at a tremendous rate of speed. 

Lt Arnold received this information some time later. It Arnold had noticed the object, but when he attempted to locate it in the sky again, he was unable to do so. Lt Arnold circled the area in an attempt to locate the object, but was unsuccessful in his efforts.

There were only three aircraft airborne at the time, comprising the normal traffic pattern at the base. Lt Arnold questioned the pilots of these aircraft, but they had not observed the object.

In Arnold's opinion, the object was not a jet aircraft, nor could it have been a meteor, since its movements and speeds were not consistent with either of these. Lt Arnold stated that he was puzzled by the incident and could offer no explanation for the object's unusual characteristics or behavior.

The object was observed by Lt. S. Arnold for approximately seven minutes and the object appeared to be at a distance of about 3 miles. The first observed the object at 2300 hours and it disappeared from his sight at 2307 hours. The observer was able to track the flight path of the object. The size of the light was estimated to be about 1 foot in diameter and the color was a reddish orange. The motion of the object was stated to be erratic and its speed was estimated to be in excess of 500 M.P.H. and its maneuvering which consisted mainly of rapid vertical and horizontal movements was observed by the observer to be un-conventional and shortly thereafter reported the incident to the proper authority.

On the night of Oct 4, 1959, an Air Force pilot at Laredo, Texas, had a strange encounter. The pilot reported seeing a strange device in the sky. Twelve miles from the field, the pilot told ground control that he was pursuing an object. It had been no accident. The strange device had raced down at his fighter, then climbed straight up. The pilot was badly shaken by the incident. 

Three years before, many Air Force officers had been puzzled by the object at Fogie's report. The UFO intelligence officers grilled him on every detail. Did the UFO (unidentified flying object) seem to be under remote control? What was its size and shape? Its speed compared with a jet? Did the blue light blink or pulsate? The Air Technical Intelligence Center at Dayton, Ohio, and intelligence headquarters in Washington, D.C. were interested in the Laredo incident. The intelligence report was cleared for me by Albert M. Chop, the Air Force civilian expert on UFOs. Chop had learned most of the details from Project Bluebook. When he transferred to the Pentagon, he had become the Air Force's chief spokesman on flying saucers.

(The Air Technical Intelligence Center's summary of the Laredo incident was sent by a LOOK magazine writer in September 1952.)

The official conclusion on the case was: "Possible air-to-air observation."

Lackland Air Force Base, Texas
5 December 1952

I. Description of Incident:
While orbiting over Lackland AFB, a T-33 type aircraft sighted an unusual blue light. The intensity of the light was described as the normal strobe light used for identification of aircraft at night. The light was stationary, and its movements consisted of a counter-clockwise orbit over the air base. The maneuvers consisted of this T-33 and a final disappearance to the south. The pilot of the observing aircraft attempted an interception but was not able to close on the object. The objects was not identified after 2025 CST.

II. Discussion of Incident:
The student flying in a jet type aircraft was in progress at the time of sighting. The observing pilot saw these objects and should not have continued with the training when the sighting occurred. The objects appeared to be approximately 2,000 CST very close to the time of sighting. In addition, the existing glints of the object as well as the general southerly heading (which indicates that the unknown was probably a balloon-intercepting investigating aircraft).

III. Conclusion:
Probably a balloon.

CASE #1

On the night of 4 Dec 52 an Air Force pilot was flying locally in a F-86 type a/c. He was at this time he noticed a rapidly moving light at approximately 6000'. It was approaching to within (1-500'). It was apparently low to his position, which was about 2 miles SW of the base at 6000' directly SW of the base traveling on a SE course. The pilot considered the object to be a jet a/c outside the traffic pattern until he noticed the absence of position, passing, and fuselage lights. The pilot changed his turn to the left to keep the object in sight. The object continued on a SE course approximately 6 miles as of his position which was approaching toward him. He had originally sighted the object. At this time the object came immediately to the pilot's altitude of 6000' and began a wide sweeping counter clockwise orbit of the base. The terrific speed of the object still led the pilot to think it was a jet aircraft until he realized from previous jet experience that the speed should have been considerably dissipated after such a maneuver. As a position approximately 3 miles N of the air base the object went into a clockwise orbit, it immediately descend to 1500 to 200' again and continued its orbit to the left around the city of Laredo, Texas, until it reached approximately the center of the business district, at which time the object made a very rapid flitting ascent due S to approximately 15,000'. The rate of climb was terrific. At this point, the object was approximately 6 to 8 miles SW of the pilot's position (which was directly over the ramp on a S heading). The object then turned northward and immediately descended to the pilot's altitude of 6,000' again and proceeded skyward until approximately 6 miles SE of the base again and it seemed to stop as if it were hovering, going straight away or coming straight toward the pilot's aircraft. At this time the pilot added full power and proceeded directly to toward the object. The pilot's intentions were merely curiosity. Approximate 2 seconds after this action was taken by the pilot, the object appeared to close at a terrific rate in a steep climb and disappeared from sight.

CASE # 1 (COAST)
Road-car approach. At approximately 100 yards in front of the pilot's a/c the object seemed to instantly change to a vertical plane as vertically deis determined on which side of his aircraft to pass. The object passed very closely off the left wing of the a/c within 50 yards distance and the pilot noted a blurred reddish-blueish haze of indeterminate size and shape but definitely no larger than his a/c. This action happened so rapidly that the pilot was unable to take any evasive action. Immediately after the object passed, the pilot broke sharply to the left in an effort to catch a better glimpse of it. The object rapidly sped away, climbing absent to approximately 15,000' and circled to the left and began to descend self-positioning itself for another pass on the pilot's a/c. At this point, out of sheer fright, the pilot turned off all his running lights and spiraled steeply to the left, keeping the object in sight and leveled off at 1500'. At this time the object seemed to level off from its circling descent towards the pilot's a/c, turned sharply to the right and made another rapid fitting ascent into the atmosphere until out of sight. The object was observed by the pilot for approximately 7 minutes and the exact time of the head-on-pass was 2053.
The object has been referred to as an "object" because it was illuminated and only by the small, flickering blueish light by which the observer was able to track its flight path, the size of the light was described by the observer as approximately 1/2 the size of the glow emitted by normal position light on a T-33 type aircraft. Its speed was estimated to be in excess of 500 MPH and its maneuvers, which consisted mainly of rapid climbing ascents and descents, were unusually outstanding, because they were certainly not conventional. The observer parked his a/c on the Laredo AB ramp at precisely 2105 and shortly thereafter reported the incident to the proper authority.
UNQUOTE COMMENTS: AISO believes this is one on an a/c and that the maneuvers were concentrated.
