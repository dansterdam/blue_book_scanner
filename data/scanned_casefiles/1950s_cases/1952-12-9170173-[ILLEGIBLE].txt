AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Laredo Air Force Base, Texas     REPORT NO. ATRC IA-M-52     PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

1. On the night of 4 December 1952, 1st Lt Robert G. Arnold was flying locally in a T-28 type aircraft for the purpose of completing 125 60-2 requirements. After flying in the local area for approximately two hours, Lt Arnold returned to the airfield to enter traffic and land. Student training in T-33 Jet aircraft was in progress and was being observed in the tower.

2. While waiting for permission from the tower to land, Lt Arnold circled the field in a counter clockwise manner and observed the jet aircraft in the pattern and landing from an altitude of 6000'. After approximately 15 minutes of holding alert, Lt Arnold ascertained there was only three jet aircraft in training. A surveillance of the immediate area around the field to see if any other aircraft remained aloft was made by Lt Arnold to determine how much longer he would be required to hold before landing. It was at this time he noticed a rapidly moving blue-ish light at approximate traffic altitude (1500 to 2000'). It was approximately 8 o'clock low to his position, which was about two miles southeast of the base at 6000', and the light appeared to be over the Heights residential area, directly southwest of the base, and trending on a southeasterly course. Lt Arnold considered the object to be a fourth Jet aircraft still outside the traffic pattern until he noticed the absence of position, passing, and running lights.

3. At this point, Lt Arnold steepened his turn to the left to keep the object in sight. The object continued on a southeasterly course until approximately six miles southeast of Lt Arnold's position, which was approximately where he had originally picked the object. At this time, the object rose immediately to Lt. Laredo's altitude of 6000' and began a wide sweeping counter clockwise orbit of the Air Base. The traffic speed of the object still led Lt Arnold to think its was a Jet Aircraft. Presumably dissipated after such a maneuver. At a position approximately three miles north of the airfield in the object's orbit, it immediately descended to approximately 1500 to 2000' again and continued its orbit to the left around the city of Laredo, Texas, until it reached another point, which was directly over the ramp on a southwesterly heading. At this point (which was directly over the ramp on a southerly heading), the object made a very rapid flitting ascent due south to approximately 15,000'. The rate of climb was terrific. At this point, the object was approximately 6 to 8 miles southwest of Lt Arnold's position (which was directly over the ramp on a southerly heading).

Lt Arnold's altitude of 6000' again and proceeded eastward until approximately 6 miles northeast of the base again and it seemed to stop as if hovering. Approximately two seconds after this action was taken by Lt Arnold, the object appeared to close as a semicircle very rapidly from the left wing of Lt Arnold's aircraft, the object seemed to waver slightly in a vertical plane as if hesitating or with desire of its aircraft to pass. The object passed very closely off the left wing of Lt Arnold's aircraft within a distance of 50 yards and Lt Arnold noted a blurred reddish-blackish haze of undetermined size and shape, but definitely no larger than his aircraft. This action happened so rapidly that Lt Arnold was unable to take any evasive action. Immediately after the object, Lt Arnold broke sharply to the left in order to keep the object in sight. The object rapidly made a turning ascent again to approximately 15,000' and descended as if positioning itself for another pass on Lt Arnold's aircraft. It was out of the clear, turning, Lt Arnold's left turn and spiraled out to the clear, keeping the object in sight, and leveled off at 15,000'. At this time the object seemed to level off from its circling descent towards Lt Arnold's aircraft. At this point, turn sharply northeast heading and see another rapid climbing ascent into the atmosphere until out of sight.

On the night of Dec 4, 1952, a frightened Air Force pilot at Laredo, Texas. Since actual names are deleted in clearing intelligence reports, I call him Lt. Earl Fogle.

Twelve miles from the field, Fogle told air-base officers, a blue-lighted object had almost crashed into his fighter. It had been no accident. The strange device had raced headon at his lighted F-51. At the last instant, it had flipped to one side, streaking by at terrific speed.

Badly shaken, Fogle watched it flash up in a vertical climb. After a moment, the object turned, circling back as if for another pass. Fogle hastily switched off his lights, nosed down in a steep spiral. The unknown machine dived to 2,000 feet. Apparently missing Fogle's plane in the dark, it circled toward Laredo air base, then swiftly turned away. Again climbing straight upward, the machine disappeared in the night.

Three years before, many Air Force officers would have scoffed at Fogle's report. He was not ridiculed now. For two hours, intelligence officers grilled him on every detail. Did the UFO (unidentified flying object) seem to be piloted or under remote control? What was its size and shape? Its speed compared with a jet? Did the blue light blink or pulsate? On and on went the questions, worked out by the Air Technical Intelligence Center to identify UFO types. Then secret reports were put on the wires for the ATIC at Dayton, Ohio, and intelligence headquarters in Washington, D.C.

The intelligence report of the Laredo encounter was cleared for me by Albert M. Chop, the Air Force civilian expert on UFO's. Two years before, a acting press chief at Dayton, Chop had learned most of the flying-saucer story from Project Bluebook. When he transferred to the Pentagon, he had become the Air Force press specialist on flying saucers.

(The Air Technical Intelligence Center summary of the Laredo incident was seen by a LOOK research in September after Major Keyhoe's book was in print.) Keyhoe believed the Keyhoe version in substance but commented: "ATIC believed that it was an aircraft and that the maneuvers were exaggerated." The official conclusion was... [text cuts off]

Lackland Air Force Base, Texas                                                5 December 1952

I.    Description of Incident

While orbiting over Lackland AFB a T-28 type aircraft sighted an unusual blue light about half the intensity of the normal glow emitted by a T-35 position lights. The time of sighting was approximately 2048 CST and under clear weather conditions with the wind at 6,000 feet from 15 degrees at 25 knots. The object's maneuvers consisted of a counter-clockwise orbit over the air base, an apparent pass on the T-28 and finally an irregular rapid ascent and disappearance to the south. The pilot of the observing aircraft attempted an interception but overshot. The object was not sighted after 2056 CST.

II.   Discussion of Incident

Student flying in jet type aircraft was in progress at the time of sighting. The observing pilot saw these aircraft and could not have confused them with the unidentified object. A scheduled balloon launch from Lackland AFB was set for 2000 CST, very close to the time of sighting. In addition, the orbiting climb of the object as well as its general southerly heading (which ties in with the winds aloft) indicate that the unknown was probably a balloon. Project Blue Book has had many reports in the past of known balloons apparently intercepting investigating aircraft.

III.  Conclusion

Probably a balloon.

CASE #1

On the night of 4 Dec 52 an Air Force pilot was flying locally in a T-28 type a/c.

It was at this time he noticed a rapidly moving bluish light at approximate traffic altitude (1500' to 2000'). It was approximately 8 o'clock low to his position, which was about 2 miles SE of the base at 6000' directly SW of the base traveling on a SE course. The pilot considered the object to be a 4th jet a/c outside the traffic pattern until he noticed the absence of position, passing, and fuselage lights. The pilot steepened his turn to the left to keep the object in sight. The object continued on a SE course until approximately 6 miles SE of his position which was approximately where he had originally sighted the object. At this time the object rose immediately to the pilot's altitude of 6000' and began a wide sweeping counter clockwise orbit of the base.

The terrific speed of the object still led the pilot to think it was a jet aircraft until he realized from previous jet experience that the speed should have been considerably dissipated after such a maneuver. At a position approximately 3 miles N of the air field in the object's orbit, it immediately descended to approximately 1,500-1,700 to 200' again and continued its orbit to the left around the city of Laredo, Texas, until it reached approximately the center of the business district, at which time the object made a very rapid flitting ascent due S to approximate 15,000'. The rate of climb was terrific. At this point, the object was approximately 6 to 8 miles SW of the pilot's position (which was directly over the ramp on a S heading). The object then turned Eastward and immediately descended to the pilot's altitude of 6,000' again and proceeded Eastward until approximately 6 miles SE of the base again and it seemed to stop as if it were hovering, going straight away or coming straight toward the pilot's aircraft. At this time the pilot added full power and proceeded directly SE toward the object. The pilot's intentions were merely curiosity. Approximate 2 seconds after this action was taken by the pilot, the object appeared to close at a terrific rate in a

head-on approach. At approximately 100 yards in front of the pilot's a/c the object
seemed to wave slightly in a vertical plane as if determining on which side of his
aircraft to pass. The object passed very closely off the left wing of the w/c within
50 yards distance and the pilot noted a blurred reddish-bluish haze of undetermined
size and shape but definitely no larger than his a/c. This action happened so rapidly
that the pilot was unable to take any evasive action. Immediately after the object
passed, the pilot broke sharply to the left in order to keep the object in sight.
The object rapidly made a flitting ascent again to approximately 15,000' and circled
to the left and began to descend as if positioning itself for another pass on the pilot's
a/c. At this point, out of sheer fright, the pilot turned off all his running lights
and spiraled steeply to the left, keeping the object in sight and leveled off at
1,500'. At this time the object seemed to level off from its circling descent towards
the pilot's a/c, turned sharply to the right on a S heading and made another rapid
flitting ascent into the atmosphere until out of sight. The object was observed by
the pilot for approximate 7 minutes and the exact time of the head-on-pass was 2053.
The object has been referred to as an "object" because it was identified only by
the small, flickering bluish light by which the observer was able to track its flight
path, the size of the light was described by the observer as approximate 1/2 the size
of the glow emitted by normal position light on a T-33 type aircraft. Its speed was
estimated to be in excess of 500 MPH and its maneuvers, which consisted mainly of
rapid flitting ascents and descents, were unusually outstanding, because they were
certainly not conventional. The observer parked his a/c on the Laredo AB ramp at
exactly 2105 and shortly thereafter reported the incident to the proper authority.
ATIC COMMENT: ATIC believes that it was an a/c and that the maneuvers were exaggerated.
