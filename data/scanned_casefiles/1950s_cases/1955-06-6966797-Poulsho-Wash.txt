AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 1-A, 4602d ATSS                REPORT NO.    1A-UFOB-2-55        Part three    PAGE 4    OF 4    PAGES

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The opinion of the preparing officer is that the sighting was probably caused by the Sandpoint NAS weather balloon for the following reasons:

a. The duration of the sighting, one hour, purports out that the object was not self-propellant, and no aircraft were reported in the air, including helicopters.

b. The balloon released at 0832Z with the prevailing winds from 140-270 degrees would project the balloon in the general direction of Poulsbo, Washington.

c. The wind variations in velocity and direction at various altitudes would create an appearance of bouncing of the object as reported.

d. The balloon was reported to have been aloft for one hour and thirty minutes which would cover the duration of the sighting.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:

Concur in the opinion of the Preparing Officer that sighting was probably caused by the Sandpoint NAS weather balloon.
