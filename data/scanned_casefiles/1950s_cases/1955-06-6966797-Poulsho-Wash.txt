The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text in the document states:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 1-A, 46024 AT93 1A-UFOB-2-55 Part three 4 Pages
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The opinion of the preparing officer is that the sighting was probably caused by the Sergeant RAS weather balloons used for the following reasons:
a. The duration of the sighting, one hour, suggests that the object was self-propellent and not a meteor reported in the air including helicopters.
d. The wind variations in velocity and direction at various altitudes would create an appearance of bouncing or bobbing object as REPORTED.
e. The balloon was reported to have been aloft for one hour and thirty minutes which would cover the duration of the sighting.
RICHARD E. HANSEN
2nd Lt., USAF
Officer in Charge
COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Concur in the opinion of the Preparing Officer that sighting was probably caused by the Sergeant RAS weather balloons.
