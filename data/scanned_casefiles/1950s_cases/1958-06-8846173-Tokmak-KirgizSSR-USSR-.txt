I. SOURCE DESCRIPTION:

SOURCE, 47 yrs old, truck driver, quiet and reserved, pleasing, of average intelligence (four years cleanery school), cooperative, showed a positive attitude toward the interview, and appeared reliable. SOURCE remembered details fairly well. No inconsistencies in SOURCE statement were noted.

From 1957 to Apr 59, SOURCE lived in TOKMAK (4252N-7518E), and worked as a general laborer with a city comst firm on coast of a four-storied bldg in TOKMAK. One and only occasion, in Jun 58, SOURCE made the observations described in this report, at aprx 22:30 hrs at night.

II. UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OBSERVED OVER TOKMAK:

In the beginning of Jun 58, at aprx 22:30 hrs, SOURCE's landlord Mr. Georg SCHOLL, residing at # 164 Slobodskaya Ulisa in TOKMAK, knocked on SOURCE's door and asked SOURCE to come out on the street immediately. SOURCE followed that unusual request at once, and, when stepping out into the open, he immediately observed one unidentified strange object, which raced towards TOKMAK in an E or ENE direction, (coming from direction of FRUNZE (4254N-7436E). The object crossed the "CHU" river W of TOKMAK, and disappeared in S or SW direction.

Even though SOURCE was unable to estimate the speed of the object, speed must have been extremely high. Not within one minute after the initial sighting of the object, it had moved out of sight. The night was cloudless and the stars were bright. Therefore, altitude of the object could not be estimated, even though it was at least 2-3 km high. Object moved completely noiselessly.

SOURCE was able to furnish the following info on the unidentified object: against the sky, the object appeared to be oval- or cigar-shaped, and appeared to have a dia of at least 20-30 cm, if compared with something against the horizon. From it's rear produced a tiny glow, which changed from a blue-white color at it's beginning (similar to that of an electric arc-welding torch), which was very uncomfortable to the eye, to a red-yellow fiery tail. Against the sky, the object appeared to have a length of aprx 30 cm, which probably had a length of 0.5 m.

When SOURCE questioned several friends and Mr. SCHOLL about this incident, everybody seemed to be of the same opinion. "The military are testing something in the area of FRUNZE."

No further details available.
