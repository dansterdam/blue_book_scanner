SUBJECT: REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT(S)
DATE OF INFORMATION: 6 APRIL 1955
DATE INFORMATION RECEIVED: 9 APRIL 1955
PLACE: DAHLGREN, VIRGINIA

1. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
At approximately 2130 hours on 6 April 1955, an unidentified airborne object was observed passing over the Marine Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia. The object was described as being approximately 50 feet in diameter, disk shaped, and of a dull metallic color. It was observed to be traveling in a northerly direction at a speed estimated to be in excess of 500 miles per hour and at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of approximately 2-3 minutes before disappearing from view.

2. SOURCE OF INFORMATION:
The initial report was received from a security guard assigned to the Marine Proving Ground, who observed the object while on patrol. The report was subsequently confirmed by several other witnesses, including personnel from the U.S. Naval Proving Ground and officers of the Virginia State Police.

3. EVALUATION:
The reported object does not appear to be any known aircraft or other object. The size, speed, and altitude of the object, as well as the manner in which it was observed, suggest that it was an unidentified flying object of some kind. The report is considered to be credible, based on the number and reliability of the witnesses involved.

4. CONCLUSION:
The incident is considered to be a legitimate sighting of an unidentified flying object. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the nature and origin of the object.
