AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

FROM Wright Air Development Center                                                 REPORT NO.                      PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

On 11 May 1952, Mr. [redacted] observed an unidentified flying object in Deephaven, Minnesota. The object was sighted from the driveway of his home at 5158 p.m. C.S.T. Deephaven is located approximately 12 miles West of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The object was witnessed moving at great speed in a direction of approximately 100° to 120°, or in other words, East South East. The sky was clear and visibility 100%. The object was followed visually until it disappeared over the horizon. The flight was observed for about 10 seconds, during which time the object covered about 75° of the distance from horizon to horizon. At first, it was thought to be a "falling star", but after several seconds of observation, it was determined that it was traveling in a horizontal plane. It appeared to be as bright in intensity as a falling meteorite, but it had a short "tail" on it.

Its brightness did not diminish in intensity during the observation period, and no sound was heard even when directly overhead. No witnesses were reported by Mr. [redacted].

Mr. [redacted] was a liaison pilot during World War II, and as such, is familiar with aircraft. At present time, he holds the rank of Captain, F.A. in the reserves. His Serial No. is [redacted].
