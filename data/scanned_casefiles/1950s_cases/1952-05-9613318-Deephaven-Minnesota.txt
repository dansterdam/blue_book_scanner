The text of the report is as follows:

ON 11 MAY 1952, Mr. [ REDACTED ] REPORTED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN DEEPHAVEN, MINN.

THE OBJECT WAS WITNESSED MOVING AT GREAT SPEED IN A DIRECTION OF APPROXIMATELY 270 DEGREES. THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 SECONDS AND VISIBILITY WAS EXCELLENT. THE OBJECT WAS FOLLOWED VISUALLY UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON. THIS PILOT WAS ALSO AN AIRCRAFT OBSERVER. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A "FALLING STAR", BUT AFTER SEVERAL SECONDS OF OBSERVATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT POSSESSED A TREMENDOUS SPEED AND LUMINOSITY GREATER THAN A FALLING STAR. THE OBJECT CARRIED NO RUNNING OR NAVIGATION LIGHTS, AS REQUIRED BY AIRCRAFT FOR NIGHT FLIGHTS.

MR. [ REDACTED ] WAS A LIAISON PILOT DURING WORLD WAR II AND, AS SUCH, IS FAMILIAR WITH AIRCRAFT IN FLIGHT. AT THE PRESENT TIME, HE HOLDS THE RANK OF CAPTAIN, U.S.A.F. IN THE RESERVES.
