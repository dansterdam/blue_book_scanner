At the bottom of the document, there is a warning text which is partially legible:

"WARNING: This document contains information affecting the national defense of the United States within the meaning of the Espionage Laws, Title 18, U.S.C. Sections 793 and 794..."

The rest of the document appears to be very faint and mostly illegible due to poor image quality.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Republic of Korea

Date 19 Oct 1959    Hour (Z) 17 0305 Z

WX Clear - Visibility 10 miles plus

Description Approximate size of the letter "c" of the word cent on the reverse side of penny at arm's length. Object was crescent shaped. Silver in appearance.

Direction of Motion Very slow to west - in sight three hours 20 minutes.

Satellite: (AFCIN-LF3, Phone 69219)   In sight too long.

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) In sight too long for meteor possibly planet.

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-481)   N/A

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc)

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. In sight too long for aircraft moving in same/direction. Possibly balloon but wind wrong.

Other

Evaluation of Source Reliability Probably very good.

Analysis and Conclusions: It is believed that the information in this report is very accurate. The object when first seen was 246.2° bearing at 41.6° elevation when last seen 27.9.3° bearing at 5.50 elevation. This indicates the object was moving west and descending. The westward rate was approximately 12° per hour; this is very close to the rotational rate of the earth and the apparent velocity of stars. The description of the object is, other than size, the same as that of the moon. Planets such as Mercury and Venus (over)


- page 3 -

Here is the text from the document:

whose orbits are smaller than that of earth have phases the same as the
moon. To the naked eye Venus appears as a very bright star, -4.5 magnitude
at its brightest, but with a 20 power critical aid the crescent, single would
be apparent. On the date of this sighting only .350 of the surface of Venus
as seen from the earth was illuminated.

On the day and at the time of this sighting Venus was in the exact position
of the object of this report, and went below the horizon to the WSW after
approximately three hours and twenty minutes.

It is not unusual for persons viewing the interior planets for the first
time through an optical aid to be startled by the fact that it appears
as a small moon, phases and all. Our every day experiences have left us
with the impression that Venus is like a star and originates its own light
rather than reflecting sunlight the same as the moon.

There is no reason to believe that the object of this sighting was anything
other than the planet Venus.

Venus was again reported as a UFO on the night of October 19, 1959, in Korea. An observer reported a crescent-shaped silver object moving very slowly toward the west. Observing it for three hours and twenty minutes through the telescope of a transit, he obtained very exact data on the bearing and altitude, which provided the facts required for identification. The object moved westward at a rate of approximately 12 degrees an hour, a rate close to the rotational velocity of the earth and the apparent rotational velocity of the stars. Venus at the time occupied exactly the same position as the object, and went below the horizon shortly after the reported sighting [1].

At the bottom of the document, there is a standard warning/disclaimer text, but it is too blurry to fully transcribe accurately.

The document appears to be a military or intelligence report supplement, with multiple sections and numbered items, but the image quality makes complete OCR challenging.
