1. The following, received from the Cleveland, Ohio Detachment of this District Office, is forwarded for your information:

On 20 June 1954, Cleveland, Ohio, telephonically contacted the Cleveland Detachment, who of this District related to sighting an unknown flying object. Upon personal interview by Special Agent JOSEPH RIGGINBELLO on the same date, he advised that at approximately 0620 hours, 22 June 1954, he was standing on the corner of West 50th and Bridge Avenue, facing North, when he saw an object come out of the skies with the speed of wind. The object came within 200 to 300 feet of house tops, veered suddenly and went up and out of sight again.

He described the object as follows:

Shaped like a cigar or dirigible, pointed at both ends.
Gray in color (possibly bluish due to early dawn).
The size of two (2) houses combined.
Not spinning, seemed to be going like an aircraft.
Emitted the odor of burning sulphur.
Came and went in a matter of seconds.

2. No further investigative action is contemplated by this office in this instant matter, unless specifically requested by your Command.

SUBJECT: Report on Unidentified Flying Object

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters USAF

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
DECLASSIFIED DOD DIR 5200.10

1. In compliance with USAFI Letter No. 25, dated 7 January
1953, the report of sighting of an unidentified flying object by
Mr. [redacted] in Savannah, Georgia, is forwarded.

2. As related by Mr. [redacted] letter, the sighting occurred
at 1047 P.M., 21 June 1954, from his home in Savannah, Georgia.
Since filed letter answered to be sincerely noted, Mrs. [redacted]
was contacted to determine what formal procedure was in filling
the unidentified flying object report. Mrs. [redacted] advised that a
form found in a book which belonged to Major [redacted] KITCB (USMC
Ret.), entitled "Flying Saucers from Outer Space", had been followed.
Interviewer further advised that she had also seen the object on 21
June 1954 and that her husband, Mr. [redacted] had sighted the same
object on 21 and 23 June 1954. According to Mrs. [redacted], the object
appeared to be similar to an airplane with a glass bottom with orange
lights shining through the object. Mrs. [redacted] stated that some
emanation from the object and its movement at an extremely high speed.

3. An extract of the XNBOH book concerning the reporting of
unidentified flying objects was obtained and a copy is attached for
your information and assistance in evaluating Mr. [redacted] report.

4. This information was previously reported to the Commander,
Quarter LFG, Georgia, by the Detachment Commander, Quarter LFG, Georgia.

Some text is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. Here is the text I can confidently read:

1. [Partially legible first paragraph]

4. There were two wing-tip objects

[Several sections with partially legible text and some circled/highlighted sections]

6. [Partially legible text about locating or describing an object]

7. [Partially legible text with "Circle one" visible]

The document appears to be a form or report with multiple numbered sections, but significant portions of the text are too faint or blurry to read with certainty. The scan quality makes complete OCR challenging.


- page 5 -

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

17. Draw a picture that will show to scale the object or objects and include in your sketch any details of the object that you can recall. Attach any drawing to this form.

[Most of the remaining text is partially illegible due to image quality, but some fragments can be made out]

20. Place an "X" in the box indicating the point from which the object was first seen at the point where you first saw the object.

21. [Partially illegible]

22. [Partially illegible]

23. [Partially illegible]

24. [Partially illegible]

The document appears to be a form for reporting an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting, with various numbered questions for the witness to answer. However, due to the poor image quality, many sections are difficult or impossible to read completely.


- page 6 -

The image appears to be a scanned document page with typewritten text. However, due to the poor image quality and significant dark/blurry areas, much of the text is illegible. Some words and phrases can be partially made out, but a complete and accurate transcription is not possible with this image quality. The document seems to be a form or report with numbered lines, but the specific content cannot be definitively determined.


- page 7 -

Much of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and heavy shadowing/fading. While some words and fragments are visible, I cannot confidently reproduce a complete or accurate transcription of the text. The document appears to be a typewritten page with multiple paragraphs, but the specific content cannot be definitively determined from this image.


- page 8 -

The image appears to be a scanned document page with text, but due to the poor quality and darkness of the scan, much of the text is illegible. Some words and fragments can be partially made out, but a complete and accurate transcription is not possible from this image. The document seems to be a form or questionnaire with numbered lines, but the specific content cannot be definitively determined.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Top of document, partially legible]
... about your file ...
... City, May, 1954

[Middle section, partially legible]
Please indicate any special comments relating to ...

[Some list items are partially visible, but mostly illegible]

[Bottom of document]
... you completed this questionnaire ... New York Year

Much of the document appears to be very faint or blurry, making large portions of the text illegible. The image seems to be a scanned document with significant degradation and low contrast.
