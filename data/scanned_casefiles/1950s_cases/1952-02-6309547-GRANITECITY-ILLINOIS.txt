1. The following are the known facts concerning an unidentified
"target" tracked by Detachment 4, 3908B Bomb Group, stationed at Granite
City Engineer Depot, Granite City, Illinois on the night of 13 February
1952 during the evaluation mission time scheduled for the 97th Bombardment Wing.

a. Aircraft 6095 was cleared from the IP of Jacksonville,
Illinois, pressure altitude of 29,000 feet, at a range of about 75 miles
from the RBS site, on a true course of 180° at about 2230 hours CST.

b. Ground-to-air radar contact was established with a "target"
over the IP at which the range and azimuth of the "target" appeared
normal, the angle of elevation in MLS appeared to approximate the altitude
of the aircraft cleared for the run and the approach of the "target" was
as reported by the cleared aircraft.

c. The "target" was locked in automatic tracking at about
forty miles from the site, at which time an altitude check was possible;
an altitude of 18,000 feet was read by use of a double control in the
altitude circuit. Due to the fact that the progress of the "target"
along the run up to the automatic tracking range appeared normal, it was
assumed that the X-2 altitude double circuit was inoperative.

d. The "target" continued to progress at a normal ground speed
and heading to the site and appeared until a approximately twenty miles
from the site, except for the questionable altitude readings.

e. At about twenty miles from the city, the "target" increased
its speed and turned to a new heading of about 197° degrees and began
descending.

f. During the time the plotting equipment was switched from
map scale (1:250,000) to plotting scale (600 yards per inch), the

83 353.41
SUBJECT: Report of Incident (10 Aug 52)

a. The "target" was plotted "Sidewinder" and was then initially plotted at a horizontal range of about five (5) miles west of the site.

b. The "target" was recorded in the expanded scale of the plotting equipment to the maximum range possible for one setting of the controls, during which it was located 1 turn, 6 miles range and succeeding speeds during five second intervals of 924, 680, 810, 804, and 741 miles per hour.

c. During the twenty-five seconds that the "target" was plotted in recorded scale setting of the plotting equipment, the "target" maintained a heading of about 1970 or "a first plotted course" and when a gradual change to the west was detectable during the last ten seconds of the plot, showing a heading of about 2000.

d. Radar contact was made with the "target" after the plot and it headed east at an altitude of about 30,000 feet, approximating that of the aircraft using the M35 site.

2. Immediate checks were made on the M5 equipment, and it was determined that the equipment was operating normally, however, the incident could not be credited to the ground radar.

3. It is estimated that the "target" was traveling at about a speed of 1000 miles per hour during its plotted descent, then the horizontal component of its speed registered 924 miles per hour.

4. It is assumed that the "target" was an aircraft passing the beacon on its run that at about twenty miles from the site, the aircraft banked and descended across St. Louis; that the aircraft began pulling out of its descent and descending at the same time banking to the west for a new level heading.

5. No wind information was available at the site for the extremely high altitudes, but the air mass movement at about 30,000 feet was in the neighborhood of 70 miles per hour from 2600.

6. Forwarded for your information as any action deemed appropriate.

1. Enclosed are two sightings of unidentified aerial objects which merit
close look request you review for a possible explanation.

2. The first, 13 Feb 52, Granite City, Illinois, concerns a secondary coverage
sighting by an automatic tracking device which eventually reaches the
camera central panel of 1700 sq ft. In this instance, there is some confusion as
to whether the one sighted was a land up by air radar or not. A brief description as
to the presence of a possible invasion layer was requested but unfortunately
not forwarded by Central.

3. The second sighting took place at Granite City on 13 Feb 52, Project Blue
Book indicates the Visual and Radar exhibits, as well as the ground
clubber respectively, just happening to be coincident.

4. As an item of general interest. Blue Book would like to know if a mission
invasion can affect a radar or air temperature low region often less.

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Radar Returns   (27 May 1953)

FROM   AFIAS-2                                DATE 3 June 53   COMMENTS NO. 2
TO     AFIAS-5                                                 No. 3 Memo/log

1. The incident reported as happening at Granite City, Illinois, 13 Feb 52, cannot
be firmly evaluated. However, since the target appeared to be normal until the radar
tracking equipment was switched to an expanded scale for a 25 second period, it is
very likely that there was some malfunctioning of the radar; although the report states
that immediate checks of the MSS equipment determined that the radar truck was
operating normally. It is very possible that additional data obtained in the data
would be of value in evaluating this target unless similar happenings have been experienced since 13 Feb 52.

2. The radar data contained in the report from Carswell AFB, dated 13 Feb 53, is
not sufficient for analysis purposes. For instance, there is no indication that the
target observed on the ACQ-14 radar was moving, traversing, or whether data could
indicate that there was a temperature inversion and a moisture lapse at about the time
of the incident. This weather condition could cause radar ground clutter signals to
appear above the horizon. Although the report states that a check indicated that no
ground return signals were received.

3. The following information is in reply to paragraph 4 of Comments No. 1:

   "The properties of the atmosphere which determine the refractive index (bending)
   and which change with height are temperature, pressure, and moisture content.

   "Excessive refraction occurs when there is a rapid decrease of moisture with
   height (moisture lapse) and, to a lesser degree, when there is a rapid increase of
   temperature with height (temperature inversion). The most pronounced cases of excessive
   refraction occur when both of these conditions prevail at the same time."
