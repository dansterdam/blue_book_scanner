UNCLASS

HEADQUARTERS 
8903D RADAR BOMB SCORING GROUP
Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas

19 February 1952

SUBJECT: Report of Incident

TO: Commanding General 
Strategic Air Command
Offutt Air Force Base 
Nebraska

1. The following are the known facts concerning an unidentified "target" observed by personnel of the 8903D Radar Bomb Scoring Group, stationed at Granite City, Illinois on the night of 13 February 1952 during the conduct of radar bomb scoring mission.

a. Aircraft B925 was cleared from the IP of Jacksonville, Illinois, pressure altitude of 29,000 feet at a range of about 75 miles from the 8903D radar site. The B925 sites observed at the station for about 2230 hours LST.

b. Ground-to-air radar contact was established with a "target" over the IP at which time the range and azimuth of the "target" appeared on the PPI scope. The "target" proceeded northward on a straight course at a speed estimated as reported by the cleared aircraft.

c. The "target" was tracked in automatic tracking at about forty miles from the radar site, a continuous check was possible until at an altitude of 12,000 feet the "target" disappeared from the radar scope. It was assumed that the X-2 altitude doubler circuit was inoperative.

d. The "target" continued to progress at a normal ground speed and according to the radar graph until a maneuvering turn of approximately twenty miles from the site, except for the questionable altitude readings.

e. At about twenty miles from the site, the "target" increased its speed and turned to a new heading of about 197 degrees and began descending.

f. During the time the plotting equipment was switched from the main scale (1:250,000) to the plotting scale (1:120,000) per S.O.P, and the "target" disappeared from the radar scope.

UNCLASSIFIED
REPORT OF INCIDENT (10 NOB 52)
CONCERNING A SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
Initially plotted at a horizontal distance of about five (5) miles west of
the site.
1. The "target" was recorded on the contracted scope of the
plotting equipment to the south and was visible on the scope. The
plotting indicated that the "target" was traveling at an average speed of
approximately 1,000 miles per hour.
2. He "target" was observed for about twenty-five seconds. During the
initial sighting, the target appeared to be a bright, glowing object, round
in shape, about the size of a B-36 bomber. It was estimated to be traveling
at a speed of 1,000 to 1,200 miles per hour, and was observed to disappear
gradually, fading from view, after the initial twenty-five seconds of
observation.
3. Radar contact was made with the "target" after the plot
and it was tracked on the radar scope for a distance of about 30,000 feet,
approximately five miles.
4. Immediate checks were made on the 832 equipment, and it was determined that the
equipment was operating normally. Therefore, the incident could not be credited to equipment failure.
5. No wind information was available at the time, as the Wind Data Recorder was
inoperative.
6. No action deemed appropriate.

1. Six 'objects' are reported to have been observed which were described as having a general luminous glow, oval in shape. This observation was made on 24 may 1953 at approximately 11:00 PM, CDT. The objects were observed for about 20-30 seconds during which time they performed a maneuver in the sky which was described as 'spectacular' and caused the observer to 'rub his eyes in disbelief.'

Transcribing the text from the document:

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Radar Returns (C 2 May 1953)
AREA: GRANITE CITY, ILLINOIS
FROM: ATAG-2
DATE: 3 JUNE 53

1. The incident reported as happening at Granite City, Illinois, 13 Feb 53, cannot be positively evaluated. However, since the target observed by the radar installation at Granite City, Illinois was of a somewhat unusual nature, it is considered that immediate checks of the data equipment determined that this radar target did exist. An evaluation would be of value in evaluating this target unless similar happenings have been recorded before.

2. The radar data contained in the report from Carroll AFB, dated 13 FEB 53, is of interest for possible identification of the object involved. The object observed on the SCR-615 radar was moving towards the North. The weather condition could cause such ground clutter signals to be received under certain atmospheric conditions and at certain ranges of the radar. This weather condition could cause the hazy ground return signals to be received.

3. Following information is reply to paragraph 2 of Comment No. 2:
"The properties of the atmosphere which determine the refractive index (bending) and which change with height are temperature, pressure, and moisture content. Slight (transient) changes in these factors, such as temperature inversions, can cause serious radar malfunction. Low-density air may result in reduced range (column 1) and, to a lesser degree, when there is a rapid decrease of density, refraction occur when both of these conditions prevail at the same time."
