REQUEST FOR AIR TECHNICAL INFORMATION

THRU: ATIA
THRU: ATIC
TO: ATIC

UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: ATIAS-5

DATE: 29 April 1953

SUBJECT: (Conf) High Speed Korean Radar Tracks

1. PERTINENT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

Information from Hq USAF to Project Blue Book (unidentified flying objects) states that "A.F. radio news service summary of 5 April 53 indicates that luminous objects traveling at supersonic speeds have been observed and tracked on radar within the past few days in Pork Chop and Old Baldy Hills area, Western Korean Front".

2. SPECIFIC REQUEST:

1. It is requested that the above be verified and, if true, the following information be obtained:

a. The specific dates and times of both visual and electronic observations to determine if the objects seen and tracked were in reality one and the same.

b. Estimated speeds by radar, by visual observation, the heading and altitude estimates, how long observed in both cases, and the size of blips on the radar screen.

c. The location (coordinates) of the visual and electronic observations.

d. A complete description of the objects' appearance investigating the possibility that such "luminous" objects could not be high speed jet aircraft such as the F-80-15.

3. REMARKS:

a. Project 10073

b. This is a routine request, but information should be obtained as soon as possible.
