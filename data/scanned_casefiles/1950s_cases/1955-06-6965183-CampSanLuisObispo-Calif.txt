10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
One (1) long, silver object, the size of a pea held at arm's length, appeared as no nose of the object was larger that the tail of same.

11. COMMENTS:
Coupled with the sighting of San Margarita, California, it is entirely that the observers of these two separate reports saw the same thing. The fact that this object seemed long does not exclude the possibility of the object being a balloon, with much balloon activity in that area it is highly possible the UFOB was a balloon.
