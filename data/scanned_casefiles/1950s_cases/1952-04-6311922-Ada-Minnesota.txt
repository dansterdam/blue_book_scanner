The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch showing what seems to be two circular or oval-shaped objects with some kind of formation or movement, with annotations describing their characteristics.

The image appears to be a map of North Dakota with a grid overlay. The text visible on the map includes:

NORTH DAKOTA

The map shows various grid lines, numbered circles, and what seem to be county or township boundaries. The top of the map has a scale or coordinate indicator with numbers 10, 9, 8, and 7.

The map is in black and white and appears to be a vintage or historical map document.

Apr. 10th, 1952

Dear Chief

SUPPLEMENTAL INCIDENT

This date as I sat in patrol car alone with my partner, Frank Olm, Nelson I see an object in the sky which I immediately called to his attention.

It was no rolling star as we know them as it went in a horizontal line, level, its course was a circle, then because of its own part of its main body, during all this time the object as a whole was on a level plane, all parts were of the same brightness at all then all went out of sight at about the same time.

This squad was going south, we were back at Jet 22-22 at 5th and Nicollet County, patrol car was facing north and this U.S. was to our left a little on the west side of U.S. 59.

I see this same U.F.O. or one like it about 4 years ago, it was north, south, on about the same line of flight, was alone that time so said thing.

First time I see this U.F.O. I was going east on U.S.10 just a little west of Jet.10-22 and in looking in the map you will see that it took.

Don't know if this means a thing or that I should even report it to you but it struck me that as both times it went the same direction there may be something in it.

Yours Truly

Re: Memo From

I believe that you have received a memo from Officer regarding an object seen by him and his helper on April 10 th.

I talked to Officer about this before he sent in the memo and instructed him to send it in as it was an unusual condition. From 1 noticed a piece in the Bisapolis Star on April 11th regarding this different object.

I believe that this incident should be reported to the Air Force as they are interested in these conditions and have a group assigned to such work with a laboratory which I believe is located at Dayton, Ohio. I believe this would be of interest to the extent of the date when this appeared for future reference and also the description of the object.

We have not mentioned the incident around here and only a few know about it as far as we are concerned. I questioned Col. J. Partially knowing this was an object and he said it looked to him to be as large as a fair sized house and that it was travelling in a horizontal plane and disappeared to lose altitude from the time he first saw it until it disappeared from view.

Yours Very truly
