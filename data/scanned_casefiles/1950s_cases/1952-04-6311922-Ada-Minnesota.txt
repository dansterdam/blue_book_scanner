The image appears to be a map of a geographic region, containing labels and markings that suggest it is from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. However, the image does not contain any photographs. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document.

The image contains a handwritten letter addressed to the "Chief", but there is no photograph present. I will now act as an OCR system and reproduce the text found in the document:

Dear Chief:

This data we I ask is a report on a very strange object that we saw or sighted on the evening of Feb. 9, 1952, at about 7:05 pm near Ada, Minnesota. 

This, I realize, is something new as we know what a lot of people think when we tell them about it, but it's true. It was a fast moving object with a sort of a yellowish-green light that lit up the country-side very bright as it passed over. 

When this happened, we were all in the truck, it was so fast and unexplainable that we couldn't believe our eyes, and we watched it until it went behind some trees across the road from us. It left no trail or smoke or any noise as it went by. I would estimate that it was traveling at least 300 to 500 mph as near as I could judge.  

It seemed to be about 15 to 20 feet in diameter, and it was about 150 to 200 feet up in the air. There was no doubt in our minds that it was not a shooting star, plane, helicopter or anything we have ever seen before. 

This is about all I can say about the size and speed and direction. It was going from North to South. I have marked on the map where we were when we saw it and where it went behind the trees. If this interests you at all, I would be glad to give you any other information I can. I am sure you have seen other reports like this, but I thought you would want to add this one to your files too.

Yours Truly,
Dietloff Sabel

Re: Memo Fro,

I believe that you have received a memo from
me April 15 regarding an object seen by him and his brother.

I talked to Officer ,,) about this before 
he sent to the memo and instructed him to send it. it is an 8-page memo
unusual conditions. Then i referred a copy to the 118 ARROMT staff
on April 21th regard memo.

1 believe that this incident should be reported
to the Air Force as they are interested in these conditions and have
a creen designed to such event with us. I understand this has been
investigated by them and that I would like a further report on the
extent of the data when this is prepared for future reference and also
the description of the object.

We have not mentioned the incident around here
and only learned about it after the memo reached us. Anything of
this particular nature is too late as they are more than a few
it as there are none as this as only way to see if
we first saw it when it was seen in this horizon as a was
not first few as usual at dinsnpeared from the view.

Yours very truly,

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report from "Project Blue Book", which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text describes an "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" dated 3-52 regarding an unidentified flying object sighting.

The report provides details about the sighting, including the date, location, and witness statements. It discusses the visual characteristics of the observed object, such as its size, color, and visibility. The report also mentions that no physical evidence was found.

The document concludes with a warning that the information is unclassified, but disclosure to an unauthorized person is prohibited by law.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically a "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" regarding an unidentified flying object sighting near Ada, Minnesota on April 29, 1952.

The text of the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
United States Air Force

3. Mr. from (b)(6)

The sighting was investigated by the Chief, Analysis Branch of the 31st Air Division. The report states that a similar object was seen about four years earlier in the same general area, but the witness said nothing about it because he "had no other witnesses at that time."
