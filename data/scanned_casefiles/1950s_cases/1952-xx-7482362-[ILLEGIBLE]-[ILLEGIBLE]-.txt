There were at least six men, plus one officer, on forward deck. The men were all working with ropes which were being hauled up on the boat and moving on wheels. However the officer as well as the man at steering wheel, must have seen object as they would have to look, in that direction in order to have boat going in proper direction.

The boat was scheduled to leave Yarmouth dock at 6:30 P.M. so it was observed shortly after that time. I am sure the steamship lot Boston could easily give direction, time and show just boat was shifting away from dock, and elsewhere or not and by which men on the boat office. My out of the way, to the rear, watching what was being cast away, and that is the reason why no one was around the section what I was standing.

CONFIDENTIAL SECURITY INFORMATION

DETAILS:

1. This investigation opened at the direction of the District Commander, 17th District OSI, predicated upon the reported sighting of an unidentional aerial object by Mr. Road, Placitas, New Mexico.

AT ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO

2. On 21 July 1952, Mr. [redacted] Road, Placitas, New Mexico, was interviewed in the Hilton Hotel, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and stated substantially as follows:

About 2155 hours, last Friday night, 18 July 1952, my daughter and I were lying in the front yard of my home at Placitas, New Mexico, observing the Constellation Corona Borealis. About in the center of this Constellation, there appeared a yellowish-orange glowing object which was moving at a tremendous rate of speed. From our place of observation Corona Borealis was almost directly overhead and this object moved directly to the East from about 15 or 20 seconds, made a 90° turn South for about 5 seconds, turned 90° West and remained on that course for 2 or 3 seconds, when it again turned 90° South and stayed on that course till out of sight. The object did not appear to flame out, nor did it make any sound that was audible to us. I have no idea as to its size or shape; however, it appeared more brilliant than a star and to be flying on the same level as the stars. Its altitude appeared to remain constant. My daughter and I have been observing the stars for about one half (½) hour prior to sighting this object, and our eyes were accustomed to the dark. The entire period of our observation of this object was about one (1) minute. It was not a star or meteor, as we see falling stars and meteors almost every night there. I have not seen a similar occurrence.

Mr. [redacted] advised that during the war he was a Navigation, Meteorology and Trigonometry Instructor for the Army Air Corps at Long Beach, California, and was familiar with the Constellations and their positions in the sky, and also the action of meteors, constellations and falling stars.

3. An Aeronautical Chart was furnished: Mr. [redacted], which he used to locate his residence at Placitas, New Mexico, with a mark at longitude 106° 28' West; latitude 35° 18' North; which point is approximately 5 miles due East of Bernalillo, New Mexico.

         Washington 25, D. C.
         ATTN: Director of Intelligence

1. This is to confirm the telephone call made to the Director of Intelligence, Headquarters Command, USAF, by an agent of this office on 23 July 1952. In this telephone call, information was relayed which was received from Special Agent FRANCIS B. McGIVERN of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

2. According to Special Agent McGIVERN, two (2) former Air Force military personnel, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], Arlington, Virginia, were traveling on Highway #211 near Centreville, Virginia, early in the morning of 19 July 1952. While traveling, their automobile (which is owned by [REDACTED]) was struck by an object which apparently fell from the sky. This object left powder marks on the automobile and then fell to the road. [REDACTED] did not place any particular significance on this incident at the time and left the object on the side of the road where it fell. Upon arriving in Washington, they heard about the unconventional type of aircraft sighted in the Washington vicinity and wondered whether the object which hit their car had fallen from such aircraft. They thereupon referred this matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They are keeping their automobile in such a location as that it can be readily accessible for examination.

3. This office is referring this matter to you for whatever action you might deem appropriate. The Office of Special Investigations is not taking any further action.

1.  [Redacted name] reported that on the night of 27 July 1952, at 2012 EST, while sitting in a darkened room in her second story apartment she observed an unidentified object of some marine color.  Object, when first sighted, was oblong in shape similar to a cigar.  Immediately after sighting, the object changed to a round shape and then back to an oblong shape.  At first sighting the oblong shape seemed to be wavering, similar to an air current disturbance.  The object, in its oblong form, had a misty aqua marine halo around it but upon changing to a round form, the halo disappeared and the object became clearly defined.  The halo around the object was a misty aqua marine color.  Object in its round form was compared to the size of a child's ball 10-15.  No noise was heard at any time of the observation which was of 3 seconds duration.  Source also stated the object appeared to be a large than the airplanes and had noted flying over the coast line south of her apartment, and was flying over the city.  She also stated that it was traveling at a much greater speed than the jet aircraft that she had seen flying over the island.

2.  Following is the weather at time of observation:  Wind, light and variable at all altitudes; cloud coverage, 3/8 average at 3500 ft. and at 5500 ft.; Visibility, 20 miles.

COMMENT BY PREPARING OFFICER:

1.  Source was questioned over the telephone the same evening of the sighting and was interrogated personally the next morning.  She appeared to have a good substantive and was rational, composed.  She was born in Pennsylvania and had lived in different parts of the United States until coming to Hawaii in 1947.  She stated that while living in Michigan she had observed numerous falling stars and elsewhere 13 lights and experienced no facts that the object sighted was similar to any of these.

                                                                        WM L. FRISBIE
