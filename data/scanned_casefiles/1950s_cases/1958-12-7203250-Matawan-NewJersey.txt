Att: Officer in Charge
UFO Office

Gentlemen:

We would like to report the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object on
1 December, 1958 at approximately 1637 hours E.S.T.

The object when first sighted seemed to be a jet trail inasmuch it was
white in color and had that general shape. When first sighted it was inclined
approximately 60° with the horizon. It then changed to a level position. A
few moments later it seemed to turn and for end (still in a level position)
until it became a small white brilliant dot. Then without any other apparent
motion it vanished. The object was under observation for about two minutes.

Our position of observation was:
Latitude 40° 25.25'
Longitude 74° 13.51'

Approximate altitude of sighting was 3°. Approximate bearing was 230° True.
Height of observers above mean sea level was approximately 451. Apparent
distance of the object was five miles. Naturally we cannot be certain of
this since its exact size is naturally unknown. Observer position and
bearing to object was determined from C.&G.S. Chart No. 369.

Observers were:
