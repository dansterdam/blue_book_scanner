MEMO FOR GENERAL CABELL:

In regard to the incidents involving observation of an unidentified object by pilots or USAF aircraft on 27 and 28 April 1950 in the vicinity of Misawa Air Base, Japan, we are convinced that the cases actually saw what was described.

As to what the object actually was, we feel that it was not an aircraft or aerodynamic device of any sort, but was a visual effect produced by shock waves from other USAF aircraft in the area at the time each observation was made. In this connection we believe that the effect resulted from shock refraction of light rays caused by varying densities of air caused by shock waves, such as the condensation effects which can be photographed or superimposed vapor or super-cooled water vapor in the atmosphere, or a combination of both these possibilities. The distorted light signals would also explain the various colors and "pulsing" effects noted, all of which suggest not a solid thing but a "condition" which existed in the space. If polaroid material was used, its optical characteristics could have contributed to the appearances in form and color.

This case in some respects is similar to the excitement caused by "temperature inversions" over certain bodies of water, which decided the performance of jet aircraft. All this seems to prove that in advancing use of performance of jet aircraft, there will continue to be sights and sounds that were not associated with the old.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
COUNTRY: JAPAN
IT 1R-U/AG-10
ID NO. 1414305
DATE OF INFORMATION: 5 MAY 1950
DATE OF REPORT: 27 APRIL 1950
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object
SUMMARY: On 27 April 1950 at 1330 hours an unidentified aerial object was observed over Camp Haugen at 25,000 ft. A pilot who was scheduled to fly observer for the element was unable to take off due to mechanical failure. The object appeared to be traveling at 550-600 mph and was observed for 10-15 minutes before it disappeared.
1. The T-33 aircraft was at 25,000 ft. orbiting to the left, indicating 323 mph. The unidentified aerial object was observed at the same altitude approaching from the east. When it reached a position ten (10) miles west of the aircraft, the pilot was able to obtain a good visual on the object. The pilot states that the aerial object was first sighted at 1445 and was observed for 10-15 minutes before it disappeared from sight. The object appeared quite large in size and the pilot could not positively identify it as a 7th Fighter Bomber Squadron aircraft by the color or the aircraft's markings. The object appeared to be travelling a great deal faster than his own aircraft.
2. There was no evidence of exhaust and there appeared to be no apparent means of propulsion. The object seemed to be gliding and it was observed against clear sky. The object seemed to be flying at 275 to 300 mph.
3. The pilot could not believe what he had witnessed and was convinced that he was not seeing his element leader. The pilot's up-wind was erratic and there was no other indication which would indicate the pilot was hallucinating.
4. The pilot appeared to be conservative in his statements and preferred to "think out" the matter rather than give any impression resolved, was that whatever the object was, it impressed him as not being of this world.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unidentified Aerial Object
PLACE: JAPAN
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 5 May 1950
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 1730Z
SUBMITTED BY: Lt. M. E. Banks, USAF
SUMMARY: (BASED ON BANKS' REPORT)
On 5 May 1950, at approximately 1730Z, an UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT was observed by Banks and other personnel of the 5th Air Force, APO 710. The object was first sighted at an altitude of approximately 30,000 ft., heading approximately 300° at 300-mph. The pilot observed one flying object approximately 10,000 ft. above his aircraft on a heading of approximately 600-650 mph. The object was visually sighted for approximately five (5) seconds, during which time it covered a distance of approximately one (1) mile. According to the pilot, the object appeared to be disc-shaped, larger than a C-47 and traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing to the left of the aircraft on a heading of 270°. The object appeared to be silver in color.
The size and the object was approximately twelve (12) ft. in length, twelve (12) ft. in width. The characteristics were similar to a large silver sphere, reflecting the sun's rays, and resembling a silvery mirror.
After sighting the object, the pilot descended to 18,000 ft. and searched the area for the unidentified aerial object, but was unable to locate it. During the entire period, the pilot had good radio contact with Radar Site #18, but received no information concerning the object, other than the fact that the other aircraft in the area at the time failed to pick up the unidentified object.
There was no evidence of propulsion, exhaust, control surfaces, or lights. The object disappeared and silently as it was first observed. The object's distance from the aircraft's position was difficult to ascertain, but it is believed to have been several miles. The object disappeared over the top of the clouds and was no longer observed.
The interrogator has personal knowledge of the observer's character and can sincerely state that he is conservative, unesuming, and never given to exaggerations.

Flying Saucers Again
By Australis (This Time)
SYDNEY, Australia, Monday, May 9 (AAP)-Reports of "flying saucers" streaked through the skies over Sydney and many parts of Australia, and officials said they could not deny the many sight them.
Reports came from four widely separated suburban areas of Sydney, and in each case the observers said the objects were larger than a plane, travelled at great speed, and made a "flash across the sky shortly after dusk. Two of the reports came from the air force officer, a veteran of world War II.
The Royal Australian Air Force said there were no jet planes on duty near Sydney at the time the objects were reported, and it could not explain the phenomenon.
