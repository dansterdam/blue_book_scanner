Melbourne
17th January, 1954

UNCLASSIFIED

I wish to bring to your notice the sighting of an object, which could be described as a "flying saucer". Although our association was harmless, the sighting was disturbing, and if known to the public it could cause panic and criticism. My company is a very respectable one, and I feel it my duty to report the matter fully, and to ensure that the lady's identity is not associated with me. 

As a result of this sighting our name will undoubtedly become associated with the topic. Also, in working to your wish for an investigation, I feel that this could be regarded as derogatory to the standing of my company. Therefore, I trust it will be treated with discretion, and that an association with me will not be publicized.

Both me, and my companions, were without binoculars, and therefore the times mentioned can only be approximate. The sighting occurred on Friday last, the 15th. inst., and we were in a car parked.

near a Gravel quarry at the Pape, which are two hills about 5 miles west of Mansfield.
On the 8th of January 1954 on the occasion of the gravel pit quarry we were inspecting the proposed sight of a new power line, we had a clear view to the eastwards, and the trees and hows lines looked
the Paper; we had a clear view to the eastwards, and the trees and hoses lines of
the Paper we had a clear view to the eastwards, and the trees and hoses 1 look
very distinct.

At about 9:30 p.m. we heard a faint whirring sound like the wind causes in the
wires in the vicinity. Within a matter of seconds an object dropped into view
from the east at an Angle of about 30 degrees. It appeared to be silver in color,
circular in shape, and about 40-50 feet in diameter. It came down very slowly
and gave off no sound whatsoever. We noticed two small green lights flashing
intermittently on the under side, but no other lights were visible.

For at least 10 minutes we had a full view of the object, which appeared to be
at least 1000 feet up. It departed in the same direction as it came, and ascended
very rapidly, climbing at an angle of about 80 degrees. The object gave off no
sound at any time. The only illumination was from the small green lights, which
their edges together. The whole affair was in bright moonlight, not like a meteor.

After the 10 minutes we heard the drone of a plane and saw previously sighted
lights continuing in the direction of Melbourne. Almost simultaneously the whirring
sound ceased. At no time did we notice any further movement or change in the
object after the initial drop and ascent. When the object was nearest to us it appeared
to be about 3000 feet away. The gaseous lights or luminous seemed smaller than
the actual object. On completion of the sighting we estimated the object at
something like 40-50 feet in diameter, and it was traveling at a terrific speed in the
direction of the plane. On completion of the sighting the object was in view for a
matter of about 15 seconds. The two green lights appeared under the object and
quickly disappeared over the horizon, the object having reached an estimated height
of at least 20,000 feet in the space of possibly 15 seconds. The object had
occupied before leaving to pursue the plane, only a few minutes previously. We
estimated the time to be about 9:45 p.m.

We then decided to leave, and immediately the car lights were turned on, a green
light appeared in the sky, flashed briefly, and from the edge of the sunset, in the
direction of the bright haze. There was a sudden roar at the same time, and the saucer departed
leaving a trails of yellow sparks, at a terrific speed, being lost to sight within seconds.

In discussing the whole matter with my friend, he told me that there had been
previous sightings in Mansfield, and these had been in the vicinity of the power
lines. He also stated that one or two nights prior to our sighting, a bright light
had been seen in the same area, and what appeared to be a "trail of sparks".

I would like to add that the Saucer or object in the case does appear to be of a bright metallic
but from my observation the bright metal exists only as described in this letter.

MURCHISON CITIZENS REPORT SIGHTING "FLYING SAUCERS"
The story describes a reported UFO sighting by two local citizens near Athens, Texas. It states that the object was seen on Tuesday, January 5, 1954 at a 45 degree angle in the sky. The object was described as appearing brighter than a star and making no sound. When the observers returned home, they saw the object again, this time making a "zig-zag" motion. The report concludes by stating that the object was not identified.

SAUCER-LIKE OBJECT SEEN HERE - MONDAY
This article discusses another reported UFO sighting, this time in Athens, Texas on Monday. The object is described as saucer-shaped and was seen by multiple witnesses, including a Mrs. Skinner who reported seeing it for around 15 minutes. The article states that attempts were made to determine the nature of the object, but it remained unidentified.
