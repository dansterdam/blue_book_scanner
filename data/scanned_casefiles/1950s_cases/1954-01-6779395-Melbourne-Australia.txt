Sir,

I wish to bring to your notice the sighting of an object, which could be described as a "Flying Saucer". The sighting occurred while I was in the company of a lady, and although our assumption was harmless, the reaction was clandestine, and to known if I know could be most embarrassing to the lady. Under the circumstances it was the lady's wish, and my undertaking to her that the sighting not be reported. However, after careful consideration I feel it my duty to report this matter fully, and to honour the lady's wish, I will refrain from mentioning our names which will obviate any risk of her identity and/or association with me, becoming known. Also, in writing to you, I feel more confident than if I would have written a Civil Department, that the matter will be treated in confidence. You may, of course, regard this as just an anonymous letter, but in view of the foregoing I earnestly request that it not be treated as such, as I please appreciate that I would hardly go this trouble to mislead you, or anyone else.

Both me, and my companions were without watches, and therefore the times mentioned can only be approximate, but you would no doubt establish accurate times, if you so desired, from events that will be mentioned. Naturally any measurements given can only be regarded as approximate.

The sighting occurred on Friday last, the 15th. inst., and we were in a car parked

near a Gravel Quarry at the Paps, which are two hills about 5 miles west of Mansfield. 
Entrance to the site is gained through a gateway off the Marcondah Highway, between 
Mansfield and Jaindraville. The sky was clouded, and from our elevated position at 
the Paps, we had a clear view to the Eastward, and the street and house lights of 
Mansfield could be plainly seen in front of us. The car was facing East.

At about 9:30 pm we heard a faint whirring sound like the wind causes in 
telephone wires, but there was not a breath of wind, and as far as I know no telephony 
wires in the vicinity. Within a matter of seconds an object dron into view directly 
in front of us at about 300 yards distant. In profile, the object looked like a mush-
room, complete with short stem. We noticed two small green lights facing downwards on 
the underside of the mushroom. Then about 200 feet above the ground, the object ceased 
to drop, and remained stationary, the green lights being immediately extinguished, and 
the whirring sound seemed to become louder.

For at least 10 minutes we had a full view of the object, which was circular, and 
at least 150 feet in diameter. In descent it looked in profile like a mushroom, but 
with their edges together. The rim was in bright metal, like aluminum in appearance, 
and about 12 feet wide. On top of the object, including the stem, was dull. The 
stem appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter, and about 25 feet in length. From the 
bottom of the stem to the top of the object seemed to be about 30 feet.

After the 10 minutes we heard the drone of a plane and having previously alighted 
from the car to have a better view of the Saucer, we saw the navigation lights indi-
cating that the plane was travelling Northwest. Almost simultaneously the whirring 
sound from the Saucer ceased, and it made a rapid vertical ascent, emitting a yellow 
gaseous light from the bottom of the stem. We estimated that the time was then about 
9:40 pm. On attaining about 1000 feet, the gaseous light from the stem ceased, and a 
similar light appeared on the side of the stem, and the Saucer then proceeded hori-
zontally at a terrific speed in the direction of the plane. On completion of the 
circle, which was a wide one, the Saucer then headed towards us, and in the matter of 
seconds was again overhead at about 3000 feet. The green lights appeared under the 
Saucer, and on opposite side of the stem, and the Saucer immediately commenced, and 
the Saucer became stationary in what appeared to be the same position that it 
had occupied before leaving to pursue the plane, only a few minutes previously. We 
estimated the time to be about 9:50 pm.

We then decided to leave, and immediately the car lights were turned on, a green 
light appeared momentarily facing us, and from the edge of the Saucer, in the middle 
of the bright band. There was a sudden roar at the same time, and the Saucer departed 
leaving a stream of yellow gaseous light, being emitted from the side of the stem.
With this, I named the only "the Saucer" on the second, the Saucer was on the outskirts 
of the town, and only then did it commence to climb to a higher elevation, and then 
disappeared in a North Easterly direction.

In discussing the whole matter with my friend, she told me that there had been 
previous sightings in Mansfield, and those had been in the vicinity of the Golf Links, 
and she was quite interested in the event.

Such reports may have already reached you at other investigation investigating this 
matter, but if not, I hope this one is of use.

I would like to add that the Saucer in flight does not appear to be of a bright metal, 
but from my observation the bright metal exists only as described in this letter.

Murchison Citizens Report Sighting "Flying Saucers"

For the third time in as many days reports from persons, who said they had observed "strange metallic-colored disks" in the skies near Athens, came in Thursday.

Mrs. W. M. Taylor, Murchison postmistress, stated that she had seen one of the objects on Tuesday, day prior to the time that Mrs L. Skinner, Athens housewife, made the first reported sighting. Mrs. Taylor was hanging out clothes when her back yard was not a reflection. She said the object was shining bright and was not a plane reflection.

She said there was no vapor trail, as is sometimes left by jet planes, or no sound of engines. Mrs. Taylor said she watched it between 12 and 1:00 o'clock, and though there was nothing moving in the north at approximately a 90 degree angle in the sky.

Mrs. Taylor said she ran toward her house to call her husband but that when they returned the object had gone.

Mrs. Skinner's sighting was also made while she was hanging out clothes but she was able to give a more accurate description of what she saw and it is believed from the accounts of the incident that Mrs. Skinner's sighting was at a closer range.

Another sighting made the same day as Mrs. Skinner's but also unreported at the time was made by a man who lives about five miles northwest of Murchison. He requested his name be withheld from the account.

He said he made his sighting at 9:15 in the eastern part of the sky at apparently at a great distance. He said it had a jet-like appearance and thought it had seen a jet because of haze or vapor trails in the vicinity.

He said he watched the object for some time, however, and became convinced that it was not a plane because of the rapid speed at which the thing was climbing.

The man, who is a former serviceman, said the gleaming object was going straight up at an apparently tremendous rate of speed. He said he knew that the Air Force saw some jets that will fly faster than the speed of sound, but that they don't appear to be moving so fast when observed at a great distance.

He said the object "shot" straight up for a time and then headed into the east and quickly disappeared.

Phil Dibert, a Tyler Morning Telegraph reporter, reported seeing an unidentified object near Winona Wednesday morning. His description first given by Mrs. Skinner, although it was not as detailed. He said the object disappeared in the same manner as the one seen by Mrs. Taylor.

Further reports had been received by The Athens Review Friday morning but an interview with the observers had not been arranged at press time.

[Bottom section of newspaper clipping]

Saucer-Like Object Seen Here Monday

An object resembling a flying saucer was observed hovering in the southeast outskirts of Athens in the immediate vicinity of the L. Skinner home, who resides about a half mile from the center of town.

Mrs. Skinner, who was hanging out clothes in her back yard at the time, said she first saw the object, a gleaming object, coming from the southeast and moving in a northwesterly direction.

She said the object seemed to be hovering at the ground or tree top level and appeared to be making a full turn. She described the turn as being a "gliding and sliding" motion.

Mrs. Skinner, who said the object resembled a "large tea kettle" when seen from one observed the haze surrounding it, said she saw no smoke, heard no crackling or saw none of the colors which generally accompany such objects.

The thing then appeared to be either in construction and the high top took on a dome-like appearance. She said she could not determine the speed, size or height of the object but thought she observed it for about five minutes before it passed from her view toward Tyler at a speed which appeared to be slower than an airplane flying at about 1,000 feet.

The sighting was made by Mrs. Skinner at about 3:30 p.m. Monday and she said after walking to a neighbor's house nearby and calling to her.

Mrs. Skinner's neighbor was unable to get outside of her house in time to see the object, however. Mrs. Skinner suggested that someone else may have seen the object and urged that a report be made as soon as they learned that someone else had observed it, too.
