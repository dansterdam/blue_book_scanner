The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report form, with text describing an investigation into an unidentified flying object sighting. The text states that the investigating officer was unable to establish a logical explanation for the sighting, as the object's motion and behavior could not be readily explained by conventional aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Keesler Air Force Base  
PAGE 4 OF 4 PAGES

Investigating Officer was unable to establish a logical explanation for the sighting since the remote section of the state of Mississippi area indicated the object has high speed and maneuverability which was beyond the capabilitiesof any aircraft or helicopter currently in use.  The individuals questioned were of high calibre and co-operated to the fullest extent possible, and both statements and drawings were made as close as observation and interrogation would permit. Subject of vital importance, possibly reporting unidentified flying object. Although no physical sample is available, details of sighting and maneuverability indicate that it was probably not a conventional aircraft.

DES FLIES BENEATH THUNDERSTORM IN GREENRILLE, OHIO: DEC 26, 1954 -- CIVILIAN OBSERVATION BY MR. AND MRS. F. KROB. OBJECTS WERE SEEN AT THE NORTHWEST HORIZON, HOVERING STATIONARY AT FIRST. THEY THEN MOVED SUDDENLY AND COURSE ERRATICALLY FROM THE NORTHWEST, PASSING DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. THE OBJECTS APPEARED AS A FLIGHT OF LIGHTS, ALMOST AS IF SUSPENDED FROM A MOTHER CRAFT. IT EMITTED A BRIGHT LIGHT, ALMOST AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT, AND CHANGED SHAPE AND SPEED RAPIDLY, DASHED UPWARDS AND THEN SUDDENLY FROM SIGHT. IT MOVED VERY FAST ESTIMATED 1000 MPH. IT HOVERED FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS AND THEN DASHED OUT OF SIGHT. THE OBJECTS WERE VIEWED FROM THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW AND WERE WATCHED FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES BEFORE THEY DISAPPEARED. NO NOISE WAS HEARD.

1954 - JAN. 17 THIS WRITER SIGHTED THE FLIGHT OF A BLUISH-WHITE DISC. WHILE A FEW DAYS LATER A MR. (REDACTED) AND WIFE WITNESSED A LOW FLYING DISC OF A SIMILAR COLOR OVER CINCINNATI'S GENERAL ELECTRIC PLANT. BOTH OBSERVERS ARE CONFIDENT THAT WHAT THEY SAW WERE NONE OTHER THAN FLYING SAUCERS. SINCE THERE HAS BEEN NUMEROUS SIGHTINGS IN THIS AREA RECENTLY, FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY.
