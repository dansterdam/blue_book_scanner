Investigating Officer was unable to establish a logical explanation for this sighting since the location is off airways and in a remote section of the State of Miss. There are no nearby Air Weather Stations or US Weather Bureau Stations at which an observation balloon could have been released. The individuals concerned made as close an observation as was possible and both attempted to describe details and color, as they were aware of the importance of properly reporting unidentified flying objects as a result of publicity in various news media. The range and apparent size of the unidentified object indicates that it was probably not a conventional aircraft.

Flying Safety Officer, Kessler AFB, Mississippi. This investigation involved two young male civilians presently enrolled in the Picayune, Mississippi High School. These individuals appeared to be sound and conscientious to detail concerning this reported sighting. In addition to their own observations, they attempted to obtain an additional witness, a Justice of the Peace, who was located. In discussing the matter with servers at the time of the sightings, this was not possible inasmuch as the Justice of the Peace was unable to obtain his precise location in sufficient time to observe the object. The veracity of these individuals was investigated and discussions with mature individuals having knowledge of the lives of these two young men indicates that their story is being related in an auditory individual manner toward verification.

DISC FLIES BENEATH THUNDERSTORM IN GREENWELLS, OHIO ... THE
OF FREQUENT SIGHTINGS. Late in January 1954 about 6:45 P.M., Mr. and
Mrs. _____ were standing at the northwest window contemplating the mo-
mentary thunderstorm. Clouds were low and they had just stopped.
Suddenly and soundlessly from the northwest came a bright light almost the
size of a full moon. The object, they agreed, was disc-shaped and "had a sharp,
clear outline and glowed with a definite rotation. It moved very fast be-
low heavy clouds in a direct southeast course. No exhaust trail was visible as
it disappeared directly over a group of trees. i.e. _____ who never be-
lieved in "accurate", said he was convinced there the object was no hallucina-
tion, "as some people think they are" and that it appeared to be solid. Both he and
his wife were frankly "startled by the sight", but preserved not to report it to
the papers. Looking back to July 1954 (probably Greenwells incident is recalled...)
