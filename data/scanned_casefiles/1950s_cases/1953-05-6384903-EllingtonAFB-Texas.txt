Statement of facts received from A/2C Wendell C. Smith, AF 21464063.
This Airman is assigned to Hq Sq See Air Base Group, Ellington AFB,
Houston, Texas where he is employed as an aircraft dispatcher.

On the evening of the 19th of May 1953, the airman were at their
respective duties at Base Operations when a telephone call was received
from an unidentified person off base stating what type aircraft was in
the vicinity of Houston and Ellington AFB. The Airman went out to
observe the object which was bright yellowish orange although not as
bright as the stars. Then first sighted between 2230 and 2245, the
object was directly overhead. The object remained visible from one to
two minutes. During this time, it followed a straight course from 900
to 270°. The shape appeared to be round. No exhaust trail was seen.
There was no sound heard. Maneuvers were in a straight line. Sighting
continued above the horizon until it was no longer visible, due to
darkness. The observer was 200 feet from object and was visual. Although
an attempt was made to obtain a fix with theodolite which was unsuccessful. Speed was very fast but unable to be estimated somewhat as size
of object and altitude were unknown. The sides were clear with wind at
the ground level light. No reason able explanation can be found to
explain such an occurrence. There is no physical evidence such as photographs or other work up sightings. There was no interrogation between.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significant facts in final paragraph. List indicators at least by title. Begin list of report on AF Form 118-Part 113)

Report of unidentified lights, thought to be a celestial phenomenon or strange objects, as seen by the following personnel: A/3C Wendell C. Smith and A/3C Frank W. Hodges, both of Ellington Air Force Base, A/3C John R. Stovenson, and A/3C Nicholas R. Jones, all of whom were on duty at the time of the sighting. The report was forwarded from A/3C Smith and was corroborated by the other five persons.

SOURCES OF FIRST GRAVITY:

1. A/3C W. G. Smith has 19 months service, is a high school graduate, and now attending the Air Force Technical Intelligence School. Training. Appeared to have a good depth perception. Airman was given a thorough examination. The report indicates good judgment and his answers were straightforward with no hesitations.

2. This written report is made out in the form of a statement due to there being no technical interview. Information sheet was compiled in this base's Air Technical Intelligence Center.

3. The meteorological department at the University of Houston was contacted but the possibility of a planet could not be seen with the naked eye at this time of year.
