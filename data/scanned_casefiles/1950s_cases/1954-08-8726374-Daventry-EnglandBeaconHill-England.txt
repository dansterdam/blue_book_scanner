(AVIATION ONLY)

INTERPLANETARY INTELLIGENCE
OF
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
1007 N.W. 14
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA.

16 July 1960

Lt. Colonel Lawrence J. Tacker, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Colonel Tacker:

In accordance with paragraph 6 of AFR 200-2, I should like to request the analysis of the formation of fifteen UFOs, seen, tracked by radar, and pursued by interceptors over Oklahoma City on 28 August 1954. I was referred to your office by 1st Lt Thomas W. Seawright, USAF Public Information Officer of the Oklahoma City Air Defense Sector Manual, Oklahoma City Air Force Station, Okla., in a letter dated 27 June 1960.

I would also like to thank you for sending me a copy of AFR 200-2 as amended; your courtesy is appreciated.

That is ATIC's analysis of the 8mm color motion pictures of UFOs taken by Miss ---- Hazel Green, Wisconsin, on 11 April 1960. Miss ---- told me, in a letter dated 9 July that the film had been turned over to the USAF for analysis.

I should appreciate receiving a copy of the new AF fact sheet, when issued.

In DD DD Press Release 1083-57, 5 November 1957, the total of UFO sightings for 1956 is listed as 778; of this number 2.2% is listed as "Unknown". By my computation, this figures out to 17 3/25 sightings. Several of the other statistics are also uneven; please advise me what 3/25 or 99/100 of a sighting is?

Have pilots of the Air Defense Command, NORAD, ever fired, by rockets, g.ns, other means upon Unidentified Flying Objects? Is there an ADC order in effect authorizing such firing? Is there an ADC order in effect forbidding such firing? If so, and they are not classified, I should like to request copies.

Does the United States Air Force exchange information on UFOs with the Air Forces of friendly nations?

Sincerely yours,
JAMES MANEY
Deputy Director

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-1E2x

SUBJECT: UFO Information (James Maney)

TO: SAFOI-3d (L/Col Tacker)

1. The following is in reference to numbered paragraphs of letter, copy attached.

a. Reference paragraph one, this Center has no record of UFO's sighted over Oklahoma City during August 1954.

b. Reference paragraph three, this Center has not received the film _________ is alleged to have turned over to the Air Force.

c. Reference paragraph six, ATIC has no information to the effect that ADC pilots have fired on an unidentified flying object. ATIC has no information concerning an ADC order which forbids firing on anything which gives indication of being a threat to the security of the United States. It should be noted that Air Force records, from the time of the first airborne guns, contain instances of firings on objects due to misinterpretation by pilots. These instances of misinterpretation are, of course, at a higher rate during wars or other periods when tension runs high.

d. Reference paragraph seven, a limited amount of information concerning unidentified aerial phenomena is exchanged between the U. S. Air Force and friendly foreign nations. For your further information, no other country has near the volume of UFO reports that are made in the United States each year.

SA701-34/1 Tacker/mhb/722291

5 August 1960

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your letter of 16 July concerning unidentified flying objects.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has no record of a UFO sighting at Oklahoma City during August 1954. Provided it was reported to a local Air Force activity at the time, this would indicate the sighting was probably solved locally. Tinker Air Force Base and the Oklahoma City Air Force Station have no record of this sighting in their files at the present time. Probably copies of Oklahoma City newspapers would shed some light on this sighting, or the cause. In any event, the long interval of time since that date would preclude any further investigation of this case by the Air Force.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has no information to the effect that ADC pilots have fired unidentified flying objects or flying saucers. You must keep in mind that the Air Force is charged by law with the air defense of the United States and must contact, intercept, identify and if necessary shoot down any aircraft or vehicle when it poses a threat to the security of the United States. This mission responsibility probably gives rise to the report that ADC pilots have orders to shoot down UFOs.

Category percentages of UFOs published in official Department of Defense releases are straight astronomical computations carried out to only two places and because of this when worked in reverse, they will not reflect the exact original total or sub total.

A limited amount of information concerning unidentified aerial phenomena is exchanged between the U. S. Air Force and foreign nations. For your information, no other country has near the volume of UFO reports that are made in the United States each year.

As requested I am inclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet, dated 21 July 1960, on this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
