FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Gallery 4--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

This gallery shows, in a broader pictured portrayal by the occasional irregular shape of the exterior body,some Frisbee's have been reported to change course after travelling.
The original entrance velocity, angle of entry, size and chemical structure all contribute to the path of a saucer. Such is the variety of speeds, attitudes and directions reported.
The saucer depends on the dynamic and the direction the object is moving rather than the surface friction. When the internal forces increase friction will stop. The greater the distance between the observer and the object, the more chance of error will lie in timing the speed [.] Some observers were very steady, traveling at an almost leisurely rate. They must have been a long way off to appear so slow. Yet, two instances in 1945 maintained a horizontal course over a distance of several thousands of miles, crossing countries untried and traversed [.] Some persons reported to the Ufologics Society that on November 1, 1956, at 5:30 p.m., a Frisbee proved slowly through the sky from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania. Described as bluish-green, traveling at a moderate pace, it maintained a course for about a hundred miles. Perhaps an unusual manifestation [.] P-71. On May 12, 1951, at 9:40 a.m., there was described a round, glowing object, larger than a car, hovering just above the treetops near people. Toward the end it came to a stop, spiraled a couple of times and then simply vanished, either leaving or landing indistinctly. To summarize: Meteors can travel at low velocities and "a sightingHistory horizontal craft".

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report or document, likely containing text describing UFO sightings.

Text from the document:

The American Air Force Service Command, whose activities are directed in part on certain phenomena from the standpoint of the national defense (reports of phenomena from a wide number of sources that have in some measure to be investigated -- whether or not the existence of any phenomenon is confirmed, and the natural explanation of which, if any, is of sufficient interest to be desired), has indicated a continued interest in obtaining a comprehensive record of all reported and documented observations of any unusual aerial phenomena.

The various areas over which such phenomena have been reported observed include Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. Similar sightings that vanished without trace were reported on September 28, 1954 (AMS 6-11), October 4, 1952 (AMS 11-32).
