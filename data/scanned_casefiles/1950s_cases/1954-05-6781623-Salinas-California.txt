FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 41—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

observed to follow an erratic course, produced probably by the irregular shape of the meteoric body, some Rebolls have been reported to change course after explosion.

The original entrance velocity, angle of entry, size, and chemical structure all influence the shape of a meteor's path and its time of survival. The apparent angle of descent as seen by the observer depends on the distance and the direction the object is moving relative to the observer. When the meteor travels parallel to the observer's line of sight, it seems much slower than when it passes the line of sight at right angles. The greater the distance between the observer and the meteor, the slower its apparent motion [13].

Some meteors move very slowly, traveling at an almost leisurely rate, they soar through the sky on a long, level path almost parallel with the earth. The slow fireballs in the great meteors possession of 1912 maintained a horizontal course over a distance of several thousand miles, from western Canada to Brazil [14].

Astronomical records show that the green meteors are usually slow. Some 250 persons reported to the Meteoritic Society that on November 28, 1953, at 6:30 P.M., a fireball moved slowly through the sky from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania. Described as blue-white-green, changing to orange-red, it was huge, dish-shaped, and vanished silently without depositing fragments [15, p. 273]. On May 15, 1954, at 11:25 P.M., more than 100 persons observed (and reported) a slow-moving fireball, blue-green changing to red, of luminosity so great that it woke sleeping people. Toward the end of its course it seemed to stop, spiraled a couple of times, and then simply vanished without leaving fragments [8, p. 326].

To summarize: Meteors can travel at low velocities and on apparently horizontal paths.

15 May, 1954
Rocky Mountain States

The American Meteoric Society whose members specialize in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant—the point in the heavens from which it seems to come. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS number. The data were published in Networks, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.

The records of the years 1949 to 1953 list dozens of fireballs, many of them green that were somehow overlooked by some catalogues. On August 11, 1949, during the maximum of the Perseid meteor shower, a blue-green AMS 229 apparently wall or cigar-shaped appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho at 9:17 PM and was reported by more than 100 witnesses. So brilliant that it showed a noticeable disk, it flew in a horizontal path silently broke into three pieces, and disappeared [p. 37].

September 23, 1949, was a big day for meteors. At 1:35 AM a giant fireball AMS 246 roared over southeastern Illinois from north to south leaving a luminous train visible in five states and illuminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville and from Memphis to Knoxville. The final destination over western Kentucky was near an area near miles square and sleak buildings from Paducah to Memphis. Fragments showed from over a twenty-five mile area.

Fireballs without trace were reported from Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico [p. 151]. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 28, 1953 (AMS 233), October 4, 1953 (AMS 220).
