Here is the text from the document:

Psychotherapist

To:
the military office of Defense ?
Washington, Pentagon.

Concern to: Celestial Appearance.

I was reading in the newspaper "Der Abend" of the 14.12.50 a little notice, that your military office of Defense has observed an celestial body of unusual appearance, perhaps a satellite or great meteor, entering in our stratosphere.

For compare with your observation I send you a little sketch about an appearance I watched by accident.

Now the dates:
The observation take place at the 21. Dec 1959 in Berlin Zehlendorf, Dubrowstr.18 at 18,53 hrs or 18,54 hrs(MEZ). I was just standing at the gate, when I saw a celestial body, moving a parable with great velocity nearer to earth and disappearing with a well visible flaring red comet-like tail. The body was a radiant white ball with a diameter of 0,12-0,15 m, much greater than the just to see in the east 22 his appearance. The duration might have not more than 3 seconds. The flight from the ground was nearly 30° - 40° Above my head I saw the constellation of the "Pegasus" I think, that the body came out between the constellations of "Taurus" and "Tridanus" and disappeared near the "Aries". But I am only a dilettant in astronomic that this may be not quite correct.

Afterwards I call to the astronomic observatory, Berlin Schöneberg, General Papstarz: ? to ask for. But nobody had seen the celestial body. So I make a sketch for my own remembrance. You receive now a copy. The appearance is a little bit enlarged to make it visible. The other circumstances are the same I did see.

If possible, give me an answer if my observation is the same you had seen.

Excuse my fury style and the mistakes.

Most respectfully

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-4E2

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

23 MAR 1960

TO: SAFOI-3d (Maj Tucker)

1. The ATIC files fail to indicate any report of the UFO sighting for
21 December 1959, referenced in his letter.

2. From the description given by [redacted] the object
observed by her was very probably a meteor.

3. Due to the fact that ATIC files do not reveal a case for 21 December
1959, we are unable to make correlation between her sighting and the one
she read of in the newspaper.

4. The address of the witness is as follows:
Miss
Berlin

Dear Miss

This is to acknowledge your letter of 13 February 1950 concerning an unidentified flying object sighting.

United States Air Force files fail to indicate any sighting on 21 December 1959 and, therefore, we can make no correlation between your sighting and the one you read of in the newspaper.

From your description of the object you saw, it was probably a meteor.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
