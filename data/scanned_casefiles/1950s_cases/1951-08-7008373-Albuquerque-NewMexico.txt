1. SYNOPSIS: Sandia Base Security Guard, reported sighting large object similar to Flying Wing, but one and a half (1½) times larger than B-36, observed by himself and wife, one over land Albuquerque Area at 2158 hours, 25 August 1951, in south-southeastern direction, altitude 800 to 1000 feet at approximately 300 miles per hour. Object had flying characteristics of large dark object with black outline under wing. The object made no sound whatever and flew straight and level. Lights from Central Avenue and notes reflecting off object gave it silver color, no beam of propulsion noted. Sighting and observations confirmed by his wife.

2. DETAILS: At 1000 hours, 26 August 1951, Lt WILLIAM L. DAW, Officer of the Guard, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, notified the Office of Special Investigations' Duty Agent, HAROLD M. PETERSON, that a Mrs. ARNOLD FORT, Albuquerque, New Mexico, had reported sighting an unconventional type of aircraft. When interviewed by SA PETERSON, she revealed that he is a guard for the Sandia Corporation, and work on the night shift at Sandia Base and is "Q" cleared. On 25 August 1951, he stated he was standing in front of his trailer with his wife, waiting for his ride to work, when he saw an object approaching from the north on a true course of about 160° to 170°. The flight path of the object was estimated by him to be approximately 150 east of the Zenith from his points of observation. The object, as described by him, was initially so large that it had no fuselage, the wings were swept back approximately 150 but had no taper. As the object passed over the brightly lighted Central Avenue (US Highway 66), the reflection of these lights could be seen on the underside of the object. The size of this object was described by him as to be one and a half (1½) times that of the B-36, and was silver in color except for 6 or 8 dark stripes on each side of the center running longitudinally on the underside of the wing.

On the trailing edge of the wing were 6 to 8 pairs of round glowing red lights, located between the first strobe on the underside of the wing. These lights went out just after the object passed to the north of U. S. 66. Estimated this object made no sound whatever, flow straight and level, at an estimated speed of 200 miles per hour and altitude of 800 to 1000 feet. No method of propulsion was visible and the object faded from his view to darkness.

Stated the object was first observed at approximately 30 seconds. PA narrowly checked the time at the end of sighting and noted it to be 2158 hours. While also observed with positive agreement with his observation, no very positive about his observation, is familiar with all types of aircraft, and apparently very sincere.

3. ACTION: Attempts are being made to locate other persons who may have observed the object, and if any positive information is developed, the results will be forwarded to your Headquarters.

T.X. OTN 34.23, this Hq. 29/8112

Two civilian witnesses, from their residence at 4212 East Copper Avenue, (a trailer park), Albuquerque, New Mexico observed an unconventional aircraft, chevron-shaped, about one and one half to twice the size of a B-36 directly over the eastern part of the city of Albuquerque at 2158 hours, 25 August 1951, flying on a heading of approximately 160 degrees, traveling estimated 300-1000 MPH at estimated altitude of 800-1000 feet. The witnesses immediately reported this to OSI at Kirkland Air Force Base, New Mexico. OSI then notified this Headquarters by telephone.

This observation of an assumed unconventional aircraft might be considered significant but for the fact that its sighting can be substantiated by only two witnesses and no other evidence.

26 August 1951
Albuquerque, N. Mex.

On the night of 25 August 1951, at my home at 2159 hours I observed for about 30 seconds an unfamiliar aircraft traveling from 105° west of north in the direction of 10° east of south. The rate of speed of the aircraft might have been 350 miles per hour.

The aircraft was low enough for the moon and car lights of East Central Avenue to be reflected from it. The altitude of the aircraft was difficult to judge.

The size of the aircraft was apparently 1½ to 2 times of that of a B-36.

The type of the aircraft was that of one with wings swept back 15° approximately. No fuselage was visible. The wings did not appear to taper at the outer ends. On the rear edge of each of the wings at least 6 and possibly 8, soft, white lights were visible. These lights were round, not trailing as in jet aircraft exhausts seen at night. These lights were grouped in two with a larger distance between the pairs than between each on a pair. No red or green lights were visible.

As the object moved further south the lights were not visible.

The underneath surface of the wings of the aircraft appeared to have stripes running from the leading edge to the rear edge of the wings between each pair of lights. These stripes reflected the light whereas the areas between the lights did not reflect light well.

The most outstanding feature of this observation was the fact that there was no audible sound from motors or jets. In fact the aircraft made no noise that I could hear.

The above statement is true to the best of my ability to describe this incident.

Mrs. [redacted]

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 26 August 1951

On the evening of 26 August 1951, at 1430 hrs., a team in Base security guard with his wife observed, what they described to be a flying wing type aircraft similar to the Northrop Flying Wing bomber (P-9) pass over the location of their trailer in the west part of Albuquerque. They noted the main rotor hub and aircraft to be about half the size of a T-6, with which they were familiar. The object was low, the altitude was thought to be about 800 ft. - 1000 ft., and there was no sound. The small he attributed to be of the color of blue or blue-ish, was not apparent due to twilight but dark chartreuse stripes were noticed under the wings. Six to eight miles of solid flying light was noted in the trailing edge of the wing. The speed was judged to be about 100 - 400 mph and the object was on a heading of approximately 160°.

(See Annex I for possible related incident.)

Weather
Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind 5 at 5 m.h.

Status of Investigation
The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative results. The AC and W Radar Station at Kirtland AFB did not observe any unusual or unidentified aircraft.

The guard's background was checked and since he has a "C" clearance, it has been assumed that he is mentally stable.

The photos taken of the V-shaped object at Lubbock, Texas, (see Appendix I) were sent to Albuquerque. They were shown to the sources by the P.S.I. and sources stated that agreement on lights on the object was similar to the photo. They sketched in the wing as they saw it.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had seen the object but only negative results were obtained.

Further evaluation of this incident depends on the outcome of attempts to establish the authenticity of the Lubbock photos.

26 August 1951

On the 25th of August 1951 at 2158 hours from my home located at [redacted], Albuquerque, New Mexico I observed the following described aircraft.

This aircraft was flying in a south by east direction at a speed I thought to be about 300 miles per hour.

The altitude was difficult to judge, but the aircraft was low enough so that the lights from Central Ave. reflected from the lower side of the wings.

This aircraft was unusual in the following ways, there was no sound of motors or jets in fact there was no sound at all that I could hear. I could see no fuselage on this aircraft. The size I judged to be at least one and one half times as large as a B-36 and was shaped like a spread V with the wing sloping back at an angle of about 15°.

On the rear edge of the wing soft white lights were located in pairs not less than six or these on one side of center. These lights were very different from motor or jet exhausts as seen at night. I am familiar with the appearance of these.

From the front edge of the wing stripe extended to the rear edge of the wings with the strip ending between the lights of each pair. These strip had poor reflection.

Each pair of lights were separated by about eight times the distance between the lights of one pair.

The wings appeared to retain their size from the center to the end without any taper.

No identification or marking could be seen and this aircraft had no colored lights of any kind that could be seen. The aircraft was in my sight about ½ minute.

This is a true description of the aircraft as I observed and remember it.

3. In an attempt to ascertain if the [redacted] could possibly have mistaken an aircraft landing at Kirtland Air Force Base for the one they reported, the following investigation was conducted.

4. On 27 August 1951, the Incoming Aircraft Log and the AF Form 23's for 25 August were checked via the aid of Captain DOUGLAS F. CHRISTENSON 14672A of the Administrative Flight Section. The records revealed that a transient B-25 landed at 2107 and departed for Cheyenne Air Force Base at 2219. This aircraft was the only one on record operating within several hours of the reported time of observation.

5. The following Commercial Air Carriers, which operate in this area, were checked to determine if they had aircraft flying in the vicinity at the time of the sighting reported by the [redacted] with negative results:
Frontier Airlines
Trans World Airlines Inc.

25 August 1951 at Albuquerque, New Mexico, at 2158 Hours

TO: Inspector General, USAF
17th District Office of Special Investigation
Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico

1. Reference is made to your Spot Intelligence Report of 27 August
1951, subject as given above. It is not known whether or not you are
familiar with a report from OSI District Office No. 23, Carswell Air
Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, in which a similar sighting over Lubbock,
Texas, on 25 August 1951 is reported. Enclosed is a copy of this Spot
Intelligence Report for your information.

2. Also enclosed are four photographs taken by Mr. _______ on 30 August 1951 which are supposedly very similar to those seen over
Lubbock, Texas, on 25 August 1951. It is requested that these photographs be shown to Mr. _______ and obtain his opinion as to whether
or not this is what he saw over Albuquerque on the night of 25 August
1951. If he does concur that this is what he saw, have his sketch in
the wing that he reported seeing and obtain any other details that he
may be able to give.

3. The Strategic Air Command has been contacted and they had no
B-36 type aircraft in the area at the time. Northrop Aircraft Company
has also been contacted and none of their flying wing bombers were flying.

4. It is suggested that the Flight Service Center for this area
be contacted and questioned as to whether there were any unusual incidents on the night of 25 August 1951. It is believed that flight service
centers occasionally make notes of unusual happenings and report unusual
sightings according to regulations of CINVIS (JANAP-164-A) and MATS
regulation 200-3.

                DOD DIR 5200.10
ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 25 August 1951

I.  DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT

On the evening of 25 August 1951, at 2158 MST, a Sandia Base Security Guard
and his wife observed what they described to be a flying wing type aircraft
similar to the Northrop flying Boomer (B-49), pass over the backyard of their
trailer home in the east part of Albuquerque. They judged the wing span of the
aircraft to be about one and one half times the wing span of a B-36, with which
they were familiar. The object was flying low, the altitude was thought to be
about 300 ft. - 1000 ft., and there was no sound that could be attributed to
the object. The color of the object was not apparent due to the twilight but
dark, course stripes were noticed under the wings. Six to eight pairs of soft
flowing lights were noticed on the trailing edge of the wing. The speed was
judged to be about 300 - 400 mph and the object was on a heading of approximately
160°.

(See Appendix I for possible related incident.)

II. WEATHER

Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind 5 at 5 mph.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative
results. The AO and 1 Radar Station at Kirtland AFB did not observe any unusual
or unidentified aircraft.

The guard's background was checked and since he has a 'Q' clearance, it
has been assumed that he apparently is mentally stable.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had seen
the object but only negative results were obtained.

The photographs referred to in Appendix I were sent to the OSI at Kirtland
AF. Those photos were shown to the sources and they stated that the photos
resembled the exhaust or light pattern of the object. A sketch, drawn by
the observers, is shown in this Appendix.

It is interesting to note that a very similar sighting took place in Lubbock,
Texas. The exact time and date of the sighting could not be determined due to
the fact that the observer believed she had been an illusion of some kind and
did not report the incident. The only date that could be given was "late in

                        DOD DIR 5200.10
IV. CONCLUSIONS

None. The investigation will be continued until the authenticity of the
photos in Appendix I can be determined.

Appendix II
ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 25 August 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT

On the evening of 25 August 1951, at 238 MST, a Sandia Base security Guard and his wife observed what they described to be a flying-wing type aircraft similar to the Northern Fly-Inn Bomber (T-10) near over the taxogram of their trailer home in the east part of Albuquerque. They jumped the wing span of the aircraft to be about one and one half times the wing span of a B-36, with which they were familiar. No other data in their initial report could be attributed to the object. The color of the object was not apparent due to the twilight light conditions. Apparently six or soft dark silhouette stripes were noticed on the trailing edge of the wing. The speed was estimated to be about 300 - 400 mph and the object was on a heading of approximately 160°.

(See appendix I for possible related incident.)

II. WEATHER

Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind 5 at 5 mph.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative results. The AO and R Radar station at Kirtland AFB did not observe any unusual or unidentified aircraft.

The narrator's background was checked and since he has a "Q" clearance, it has been assumed that he apparently is mentally stable.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had seen the object but only negative results were obtained.

The "hot-shots" referred to in Appendix I were sent to the OSI at Kirtland AFB. These photos were shown to the sources and they stated that the photos recorded the exhaust or light pattern of the object. A sketch, drawn by the observer, is shown in this appendix.

It is interesting to note that a very similar sighting took place in Lubbock, Texas. The exact time and location could not be determined due to the fact that the observer believed she had seen an illusion of some type and did not report the incident. The only data that could be given was "late in early September".

IV. CONCLUSIONS

None. The investigation will be continued until the authenticity of the photos in Appendix I can be determined.

Appendix II

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 25 August 1951

On the evening of 25 August 1951, at 2135, a Sandia Base Security Guard and his wife observed what they describe as a flying wing type aircraft similar to the Northrop Flying Wing (B-9) once over the backyard of their trailer home. In the east part of Albuquerque, the object was one of a F-26, with which they were familiar. The object was flying low, the altitude was thought to be about 800 ft. - 1000 ft., and there was no sound that could be attributed to the object. The color of the jet was not apparent due to twilight but dark chordwise stripes were noticed under the wing. Six to eight pairs of soft glowing lights were noticed on the trailing edge of the wing. The ground was level, to be about 206 - 400 mph and the object was on a heading of approximately 160°.

(See Appendix I for possible related incident.)

Weather:
Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind S at 5 mph.

Status of Investigation:
The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative results. The AC and M Radar Station at Kirtland AFB did not observe any unusual or unidentified aircraft.

The guard's background was checked and since he has a "C" clearance, it has been assumed that he is mentally stable.

The photos taken of the V-shaped object at Lubbock, Texas, (see Appendix) were sent to Albuquerque. They were shown to the sources by the O.S.I. and sources stated that arrangement of lights on the object they saw was similar to the photo. They sketched in the wing as they saw it.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any case else had seen the object but only negative results were obtained.

Further evaluation of this incident depends on the outcome of attempts to establish the authenticity of the Lubbock photos.
