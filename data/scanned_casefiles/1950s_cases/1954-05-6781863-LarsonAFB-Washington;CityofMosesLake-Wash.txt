The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text describing various UFO sightings and investigations.

The text from the document is as follows:

"37 'Saucers' Sighted in '54 WASHINGTON, June 1 - Airforce officials said today 37 "flying saucers" have been reported in the United States since 1952 and that the Air Force has assigned a special team to investigating and better public reports. The reports, however, of the "flying saucer" have been inconclusive and nothing definite has been determined. The Air Force received 1,700 reports of "unusual sightings" last year. However, the Air Force says if the present rate should hold, the total for this year would be 420, indicating a decrease instead of an increase in reports. Officials attribute 10 per cent of the sightings to balloons, meteors and the like and say some 30 per cent merit closer attention, but the Air Force says it has not made any scientific determination as to the nature of the objects reported to the government."

"Capt. Charles Kibbey, Hyannis Trust Company Airlines pilot, related an incident that occurred on a flight from New York to Boston. He said an unidentified flying object was sighted behind his plane and rising fast. Capt. Kravitz said he noticed the same object but was unable to take any pictures because of its speed and high altitude."

"The Air Force said the jets were able to reach the speed of the objects but were unable to intercept them and rising fast."
