INFORMATION ONLY (NO CASE)

87 'Saucers' 
Sighted in '54

WASHINGTON, June 1 (JP)—
Air Force officials said today reports of "flying saucers" have risen off sharply since 1952. They believe more scientific investigating and better public education are responsible.

So far this year only eighty-seven "sightings" have been reported. However, the July-August meteor season is just coming in, which coincides with the "flying saucer" season.

The Air Force received 1,700 reports of sightings in 1952, last year 429. If the present rate should hold up throughout 1954 the total would drop to 208.

The Air Force still is unable to explain about 10 per cent of the sightings. Officials said that if anyone has any information about unidentified flying objects they would welcome the information.

The place to notify is the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wr. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.

The presence of a fast-moving, unidentifiable object in the sky near Boston, visible for ten minutes, was reported yesterday.

Capt. Charles J. Kratovil, a Trans World Airlines pilot, said he didn't see a flying saucer but saw an unidentified object moving amidst a sixty-mile-an-hour wind near Boston. It was not a weather balloon the Air Force claimed was in the area at the time.

Capt. Kratovil said he notified the Boston Airport control tower and received a reply after he reached Idlewild that Air Force jet planes were sent up to investigate. The object was seen by their crews. He said the object was traveling at about 10,000 feet and the object seemed to be 10,000 feet above them and rising fast.

Flying Saucer Sightings 
Fall as 'Season' Nears

WASHINGTON, June 1 (JP)—
Air Force officials said today that reports of "flying saucers" had fallen off sharply since 1952, mainly because of better investigating and better public education.

So far this year only eighty-seven "sightings" have been reported. However, the "flying saucer season"—which coincides with the July-August meteor shower—is just coming.

The Air Force received 1,700 reports of sightings in 1952. Last year there were 429.

The Air Force still is unable to explain about 10 per cent of the sightings. Officials said that if anyone has any information about unidentified flying objects they would welcome the information.

The place to notify is the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.

Capt. Charles J. Kratovil, a Trans World Airlines pilot, arrived at New York International Airport, Idlewild, Queens, after a flight from Paris, he said he had seen a charge, while aloft, "something moving."

The object was also seen by members of his crew.

Captain Kratovil said the object was traveling parallel to his plane and high above it and was going against a sixty-mile-an-hour wind.

Captain Kratovil and the other pilot, Harold Haney, flight engineer, said he thought it was about the size of a basketball.
