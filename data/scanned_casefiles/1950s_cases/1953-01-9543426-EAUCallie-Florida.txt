SUBJECT:  The Testimony of Mr. [REDACTED] Regarding Unidentified
          Object Sighting:

QUESTION: Mr. [REDACTED] will you please briefly describe the object
          with regard to size, shape, air, and color.

ANSWER:   The object was diamond in shape, elongated from wing tip
          to wing tip, similar to a B-29 but no larger than a B-36.
          As to thickness, I would judge it 3-4 times as close to
          from in thickness at 1/3 thinner point. Generally cut to
          the wing tips at a conventional directart. The color was
          metallic-gray, way up possibly metallic sheen. There was
          underneath the wing more than four but no more than ten
          blue, non-flickering lights. The lights were rather
          softly. There were no vapor trails. There was no sound.

QUESTION: What sort of maneuvers was this craft performing?

ANSWER:   The craft came in at approximately twenty degrees to my
          right from directly overhead. I sighted it and followed
          the line of flight for approximately two to three seconds.
          It came in from a northwest-by-north direction on a long,
          low bar. At the time I saw it, it seemed to reach the
          apex of the bar, was turning immediately northwest, direct-
          ly line of sight was immediately cut off by the trees.

QUESTION: At approximately what time was this?

ANSWER:   1845 hours.

QUESTION: Was your place of observation "in all" good"?

ANSWER:   Yes.

QUESTION: Were you on earth surface and was the surface stationary?

ANSWER:   Yes.

MEMO Subject: The Testimony of Mr. [Redacted] Regarding: Unidentified Flying Object

QUESTION: Where was the location of your point of observation?

ANSWER: I was at that time on my own property which I was clearing for a house to be built. This property is located in the south side of the creek on Usher Point. Other Point is about 3 miles near north of Quincy, Florida. This property is on US Highway 1, east side and west bank of the Indian River.

QUESTION: What was the distance, direction, and altitude of the object?

ANSWER: I had walked to my car and was facing approximately south. I glanced to the left and west. This unidentified object came into view. I was of the opinion it was to be lower than 500 feet, and the bottom portion was a solid mass. At the Withlacoochee River bank which line directly west of the position described, there was 250 feet away. I could not report to be 500 miles an hour or exact.

QUESTION: What was the condition of the evening?

ANSWER: This was the evening of 6 January 1953. The atmosphere conditions was exceptionally clear. It was a calm day, temperature being about 500 F. There was little or no wind; in fact, it was clear.

QUESTION: Will you please state what background and knowledge you have with regard to aircraft?

ANSWER: I have, over the past 15 years, come a great deal of travel by aircraft. In fact, while living in Puerto Rico, I was by mail made of transportation. I have flown at the rate of 10,000 to 30,000 miles a year. Yes, I have been on active over one and one-half years during which time I have observed the movement of aircraft. I was also at Berlin Air Force Base where I observed. I do not fly any type of aircraft myself.

"I certify that to the best of my knowledge, the above is true and correct."
