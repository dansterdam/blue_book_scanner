Note: This is the approximate position of VENUS at this time. 16 cleared from 13,000 ft. Can be compared by my sister at her tells to 6:15 PM (PST).

Handwritten ATC Comments:
Difficult to believe that personal pilot could mistake VENUS and ARCTURUS for UFOs, noting the objects as observed from everything points to these being the objects observed from the phenomenon to be studied. We can see pilots themselves were somewhat confused and objects had been given some illusory effects when observed at dusk or night.
