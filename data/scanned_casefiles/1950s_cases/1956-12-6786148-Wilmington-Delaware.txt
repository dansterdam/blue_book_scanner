Eyewitness account
Dec 15th (or 16) 1956
From Bay Valley is a  radio mathematician flying a  route 29 between Washington D.C. and Philadelphia when a strange incident occurred. At 7:30 PM, the man saw a large, round, bright light stationary in the sky. It had the appearance of a big bright star and was roughly the size of a grapefruit held at arm's length. The light remained stationary for about 5-10 minutes, then suddenly appeared to dart rapidly upwards at a steep angle, disappearing from view in about 3-4 seconds. The witness was amazed by the sudden and rapid movement of the light. He could not determine its nature or origin, but stated that it was definitely not an aircraft, meteor, or any other known object in the sky. The witness was a competent and reliable observer, and his report was considered of sufficient interest to be included in Project Blue Book records.

Dear Sir,
The object was seen in a clear sky and I could see it clearly. The distance was much greater than I had first thought. A good many friends of mine were with me and all saw the objects closely. What I saw was a round, shiny, fiery yellow, saucer-shaped object far above my head. It streaked across the sky at a terrific speed, then it turned straight up and disappeared into the clouds in a matter of seconds - much quicker than any plane or missile I have ever seen. The movements were so fast that I could hardly follow it with my eyes. How can I explain such an incredible and inexplicable phenomenon as this? It was a real object and bright as the sun shining through the clouds. Yet, I see no gloved for the vehicle to be real. Perhaps one day, the facts we have gathered will be enough to explain these objects scientifically. The mystery remains, but my friends and I know what we saw lighting up the sky that day. It was no balloon, aircraft or anything else of ordinary nature. Something very mysterious is happening in our skies, and the sooner we face that fact realistically, the sooner we may find the answer.

The text in the document is as follows:

"This is a report compiled in good faith to the authorities of what I and many others saw in the night sky over Wilmington last night. The object that was observed had a very peculiar shape to it, and the manner in which it traveled was not like any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen. 
It was circular, rather than the usual tail-wing design, and it seemed to just float along in a very smooth and steady motion, with no sound that I could hear. I estimate the object was traveling at a speed somewhere in the vicinity of 300 to 400 miles per hour, as it disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. Several other witnesses in the area were able to observe the object as well, and all describe it in a similar manner.
I am in no position to hold any opinion as to what this object might have been, but I felt it was my duty to report what I saw to the proper authorities in the interest of public safety. I hope this account is helpful in your investigation of this matter."

What the image contains:
That a saucer 1/2 inch wide, bell-shaped, rotational, with bright blue-green eyes could well be the length, saying with fast light.

Will you please tell me what this sight will and give me your calein Vision of it. I am sure the experience will haricana demons report of mea other than myself.

Very truly yours,
