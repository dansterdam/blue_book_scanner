Tuesday, Dec. 18th, (19 ) I now driving
from Long Valley, N.J. to Hackettstown N.J. on
Route 24. Headed north-west, time about
7:30 pm, location my car several hundred
feet beyond Turnerville Auction place,
on a straight stretch of road with no
car coming or passing traffic when
very large, extremely brilliant flying object
entered my field of vision. It slowed from the
top of sky winshield, for about 15 seconds
passing down 3/4 the width of my wind-
shield until I lost sight of it behind my
rear-view mirror, and my next glance
from road to sky it was out of sight. My
wife, sitting on my left, saw it passed the entire
width of the windshield, then disappeared.
It flew left to right, across the road that is

West to E.sat.

The sky was clear, no cloud or haze obstructed my view. I must have been a good many miles perhaps as much as 20 miles from the outline was sharp and clear. I could not see any structure. It was a hard glaring fiery yellow curved shape, at the front blended by brilliant silver appearing for what looked like a tail-like element at the rear of darker, hue reddish yellow side some sunset colors, and a hard pivot like brilliance to the entire object, but with out any mutation in color intensity, no sparkle flicker or fade. The outline of the whole was regular no detached particles, no luminous trail, no lightning up of the surrounding sky and flight not horizontal and steady. It did not streak through the sky. It was steady rapid flight of a large object in long shape away -

The sight was so eye-compelling that I judge it must have been after by hundreds of people, as it was low enough on the horizon to attract attention east of my side. It was clearly towards the line of flight. If their object →

was circular, then the tail incident would be about 3/4 of the total length. No resemblance at all to anything I have seen in the sky before. No illusion to a falling star or anything I nature. 6 hrs with such. No sound heard. General proportion as per diagram.

I was in no position to hold up a hand or finger at arm length to sight with one eye, but reconstructing in daylight after the event, would judge up

that a stick 1½ inch wide held vertically at arm's length sighting with the right of eye would cover the length of the object.

Will you please tell me what this object was and give me your calculation of its size? I am sure you will receive numerous reports from sources other than myself.

Very truly yours,
