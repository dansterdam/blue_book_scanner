22 October 1954
Marysville, Ohio

Source: World of Flying Saucers DIN

A similar fall of angel hair occurred in the United States on October 22, 1954 near a school in Marysville, Ohio. At afternoon recess the pupils of the Jerome Elementary School noticed a dazzlingly bright object in the sky. It disappeared, and for the next forty-five minutes both children and teachers watched white, cottony-like tufts floating slowly down to the ground. The material was in long strands, very fine and soft, could be stretched and rolled into a tiny ball, but quickly vanished to nothing and left a green stain on the hands. The stuff clung to grass and cars, draped the telephone wires for a distance of three miles, and was like a misty canopy over the road [6].

Unfortunately none of the material was preserved and no analysis was possible. Marysville is near Columbus, Ohio, an industrial center, and the stuff might have been waste products from one of the many factories. Since similar falls were reported in Indiana during the same period, the substance more probably was gossamer. As in the French incidents, the time was late October and the weather was perfect, a warm autumn day with a sunny, cloudless sky. Both the time and the weather were ideal for migrating spiders to take to the air, float down to earth on their fluffy parachutes, and then discard the no longer necessary fils de la Vierge.

Many falls of angel hair that occur in the warm days of Indian summer are probably abandoned gossamer. It is significant that of fourteen such incidents, reported in Europe and the United States, all but three took place in October and November, the season of spider migration [6].

"Saucer" Trailing
"Angel's Hair"
Seen In Ohio

MARYSVILLE, O., Nov. 1 — (AP) — Two school teachers and some 50 children here have reported a clear-shaped "flying saucer" which first hovered over the town, then a grand strand was handed it would disintegrate into a gossamer-like substance trailing "angel's hair."

The teachers—Rodney Warrick and Mrs. George Dittmar—told a turned green after touching the substance. Two reports made in substance, but the color was cited off without soap. Warrick and Mrs. Dittmar said their hands without rinsing in about a half hour.

Dear Sir:

A few days ago, my son came running in to tell me that were remarkable sighting occurred overhead. Since I was now a flying saucer and know what they look like, I got to thinking about it and was to the scene. At night it was almost impossible to see with the naked eye, I found the machine. Thus, it was a large, bright and shaped like a bow with a very white color. But, as I observed it closely, we were close to its approaching. Around with its shape, changing shape. They were not a common sight of human eyes. This small white object was wider and material seemed to be fading. The glow got dim and when marked it was disappeared. Now I have a small piece of drawing out of the true story. It looked much like it feels. I am very much. I am enclosing a small portion of it. I believe some people are talking. These strange new sightings, such as not, I know, are at times among material surfaces or flying saucers. Perhaps this evidence will be valuable to you. We will be glad to give you further details, if the sighting or it seems worth while.

Sincerely,

Marysville, 
Nov. 10, 1954

Dear Sir:

In reply to your direct questions, first, I was called from Columbus last Sat. by some one from --------. I proceeded to make a recording and I brought up the call of a different type of object which I had heard about, "Unidentified Flying Object." Government officials have made no statements to me, or to the news, about this. I was told by Town Clerk, Jaycee, and Instrumental Investigator, from a local paper.

I was able to write a few accounts of what I witnessed on Oct. 28, 1954. I have slightly cited on different accounts.

On Oct. 28, 1954, about 7:30 p.m. I was called to go to the water tower of our school building. We went up to look in the air and tell the rest of the town what I saw. The site is high and we far from a town so I could see many miles. With a good powerful spotlight I could look over the country, clearly floating to the ground. In the case of those glorious were full day's and no work was done.

As I know he told me how a citizen (who had done such work for some week a week before) was the first to see it. Called me to come and see a fire moving slowly. He could tell it so just in time to see a very shiny and mirror looking clear descent. This was a large disc-like object, almost 30 ft. in diameter, able to see quite a rate of speed, but at its view over the top of the school. Some children and a teacher were also looking at it before taking off. He told me it was almost as now, still no one was standing closer looking at the object. Discovered, that we saw the white burst.

I witnessed this scene most of the time from 5:00 to 5:40 until time to dismiss just before 5:00.

This later on the film scene outside area of 8 or 9 children brought silence to the look out. As the first source to see a ground or aerial scene, and as I had been there very much as if someone had been, spread of aerial their next passed some of it to me. I was told by several of the children that it was a small kind of thing related to it.

To handle this material, it was very soft and fine to touch. It did not stick to our hands but when we had it come and cut it; it appeared without scarring. There is evidence to go to no-thing. However we could roll it between our fingers into a very, very thin, small, transparent film. As I can recall, it became clearly and finally the color discovered of this own accord. Then the 8th school were more visible, glittering to the green, some on our way.

Also I had to the first place, and according to being was, as we drove the three miles from a local laboratory and ascending rising now, we drove the same distance back from the place.

[Note: The text appears to be a letter, and I'll transcribe it as accurately as possible]

[First paragraph is partially illegible, but begins with:]
that as if hands had carefully opened it out very evenly. Not only this, but...

[The rest of the text continues, but some words are difficult to make out precisely. The letter seems to discuss some kind of experience or observation, possibly related to a UFO sighting. The letter is signed "Yours sincerely" at the bottom, with the signature redacted.]

At the bottom of the page, there is a postscript that reads:
"I am not aware I have actually read an account so related by Associate Press, but they seem reliable from what I know. All of these days have been correct, but this of them very much verified, from the lengthy use in the past year."

The text is typed on what appears to be an official document or letter, with page number "9" at the top of the page.
