Bitburg, Germany                                                6 December 1953

I.   Description of Incident

The co-pilot of a London-to-Frankfurt commercial flight sighted a fast moving object for a 4 to 5 second period. The unknown phenomenon crossed his flight path in front of him at a 90° angle and abruptly disappeared in a downward direction. Time of sighting was 1800. The object was bright at its core with a faint tail.

II.  Discussion of Incident

This is a rather incomplete report. A check was made with the Frankfurt flight service center which revealed that no aircraft were in the vicinity. These factors enter into the evaluation of this report: 1) The object arched downward and had a tail. 2) It was seen for 4 to 5 seconds. These points are characteristic of a meteor.

III. Conclusion

Probably a meteor.
