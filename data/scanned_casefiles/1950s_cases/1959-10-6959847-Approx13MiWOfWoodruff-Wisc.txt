SUMMARY: (Enter entire summary in final memorandum paragraph. List indorsers in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 118-Part II)

On 6 October 1959, in Northern Wisconsin, two civilians observed a brightly glowing object streak from East Northeast to West Southwest at a high rate of speed. This sighting took place during a display of the Aurora Borealis. About a minute after the object disappeared from view, the observers heard four distinct reports, similar to the sound of an 88MM Gun.

The observers probably witnessed a phenomenon which is a part of the Aurora Borealis or a jet aircraft cutting in its afterburner.

a. Description of the object:
(1) Shape: No definite shape.
(2) Size: Cannot estimate.
(3) Color: Whitish changing to red as it burned.
(4) Number: One.
(5) Formation: N/A.
(6) Discernible Features: Smooth, constant movement - not erratic.
(7) Tail: Trail or exhaust: None observed.
(8) Sound: None.
(9) Unusual Features: About a minute after disappearance of the object, observers heard four distinct sounds, similar to the report of an 88MM Gun.

b. Description of Course of Object:
(1) Why Noticed: Observers were outdoors, looking at Aurora Borealis display
(2) Initial elevation and azimuth: Ten miles elevation, azimuth unknown.
(3) Final elevation and azimuth: Ten miles elevation, azimuth unknown.
(4) Flight path and maneuvers: Flying straight and horizontal, East Northeast to West Southwest.
(5) Manner of disappearance: Object became smaller and smaller, but light remained at same intensity.
(6) Length of time in sight: Fifteen seconds.

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Method: Ground-visual

Preliminary Analysis.
The sounds heard, as well as the sighting could have been part of the
Northern Lights display. The sighting may also have been a jet aircraft
cutting in its afterburn.
Movement of lights within the Aurora Borealis is common. According to the
Observatory at the University of Wisconsin, a crackling type of sound or
a Brush Discharge is not infrequent.
Although no definite evidence was obtained concerning air traffic in the
area, it is possible that a jet aircraft was in the general region. Flying
conditions were VFR at the time and the FAA at Minneapolis had no record of
times of flights.

1. Physical evidence:
   (1) Photographs: None
   (2) Material evidence: See sketch attached.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
See Analysis Above.

VILAS CO.
ONEIDA CO.

X- observation point
at 3000h Lake shore line

Cpt. Harry Scarborough
Public Relations Officer
United States Air Force
Madison, Wis.

Sir:

On Oct. 6, 8:29 p.m. St. T. it. from Madison and I watched the clear sky with its constellations. Shortly after a passing airliner(or private plane?), presumably going to Nodru we both recognized a burning substance flying in the direction NWNE. ENE. - WSW, as indicated in the above sketch. The very high speed, estimated at least more than 3000 m.p.h., was constant, high and distance was not clearly to estimate, but more than 10 m. both of us watched a zone of "increased burn", sending a ending glow.

Shooting stars were occasionally to be seen too, but this phenomenon was different regarding the very constant speed and path.

We feel an obligation to make this report for checking the date we call or what is commonly called a flying saucer, any way. We would be glad to have your answer, if you need more details, give us a call please, but do not into the waste paper basket!

Thank you!

Sincerely:
For the Conservation Department

The document also includes a hand-drawn map of an area showing Vilas County and Oneida County, with an observation point marked at the 3000h Lake shore line.
