The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photographs. The document appears to be a written eyewitness account describing a sighting of a light coming from overhead and disappearing after a few seconds. The text is as follows:

At 0310 hours I saw a light coming from overhead and going in a northwest direction. I saw it for about 5 seconds, disappear for another 5 seconds, going in the same straight line and then disappearing completely.

At approximately every five minute interval after that until 0330 hours I saw similar objects, seemingly to the same methods - appearing and disappearing but the sky was obscured by clouds and the Oregon Mountains.

Aug. 6, 1952

Lt. Col. Robert R. Morey 
Chief, Technical Analysis Division 
Air Technical Intelligence Center 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Sir,

On August 6, 1952, at approximately 11:15 p.m., I observed a peculiar light in the southern sky, over the Bronx, New York. At first it appeared to be a star, but as I watched, it seemed to move erratically and change in size and color.

After observing it for about 15 minutes, I decided to try to take a photograph of it. I used a Kodak Brownie camera, No. 2A, with a snapshot lens. The exposure was about 1/25th of a second at f/16, with the camera on a tripod.

The resulting photograph, which I am enclosing, shows four distinct objects, not one as I had observed. They appear to be small, round and dark in color. I cannot account for the multiple images.

I would appreciate your comments on this photograph and my observations. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely yours,

/s/ Name Withheld

MOUNT VERNON, N. Y.
AUGUST 6, 1952

RECEIVED BY: MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

On August 6, 1952, the witness, who wished to remain anonymous, reported to the Military Intelligence Service that on the evening of August 5, 1952, at approximately 8:45 p.m., he observed a bright, glowing object in the sky over Mount Vernon, New York.

The witness stated that the object appeared to be round or oval in shape and was about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared.

The witness was unable to determine the distance, altitude, or speed of the object, but did state that it was brighter than any of the surrounding stars in the sky.

GRAHAM "REX" SWAILEY, PILOT ASSIGNED TO THE 433RD FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON, HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE, CALIF. TOLD OF AN ENCOUNTER WITH UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN WEST OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST. LT. SWAILEY AND HIS NAVIGATOR REPORTED SIGHTING THREE OBJECTS MANEUVERING IN A MANNER HIS REPORT INDICATES FAR IN ADVANCE OF PRESENT-DAY AIRCRAFT.

IN THE SWAILEY CASE, SEVERAL PILOTS AND PERSONNEL SIGHTED AND TRACKED THE UNUSUAL OBJECTS ON RADAR. ONE OBJECT WAS PACED BY LT. SWAILEY'S JET FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN IT ABRUPTLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY WELL-DOCUMENTED CASES ON RECORD IN PROJECT BLUE BOOK.

WHAT WAS THE TEMPERATURE-INVERSION OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND HAMILTON AIR BASE ON THAT DAY? DOES SIMULTANEOUS SIGHTINGS, BOTH VISUAL AND RADAR, REQUIRE SOME EXPLANATION OTHER THAN THE TEMPERATURE-INVERSION THEORY?

1. Case History: (Continued)
1. This case is of peculiar interest in that the object observed did not appear to conform to any known type of conventional aircraft, either military or civilian. The object was reported to have been under the control of some intelligent force. The movement and behavior of the object was not characteristic of any type of aircraft with which the observers were familiar. In view of the highly technical nature of the observations and the fact that the object was apparently under intelligent control, this case is considered to be worthy of very careful investigation and analysis.
2. The first observation was made at approximately 8:45 p.m. on November 25, 1951. The weather at the time was clear and the visibility was excellent. The object was described as being approximately egg-shaped, with a conspicuous light at the rear. The object was observed to be in level flight at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet and moving at a speed of approximately 600 miles per hour. The object was observed to make a sharp 90 degree turn and then accelerate to an extremely high speed and disappear from view.
3. The second observation was made at approximately 9:00 p.m. on the same date. The object was again observed to be in level flight at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. This time the object was observed to execute a series of sharp, angular turns and maneuvers which were described as being beyond the capabilities of any known type of aircraft. The object was again observed to accelerate to an extremely high speed and disappear from view.
4. The third observation was made at approximately 9:15 p.m. on the same date. The object was again observed to be in level flight at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. This time the object was observed to make a series of abrupt changes in direction, some of which were described as being in excess of 90 degrees. The object was again observed to accelerate to an extremely high speed and disappear from view.
5. The observers, while highly reliable and credible, were unable to provide any additional details or observations which could aid in the identification or explanation of the object. The movements and behavior of the object were described as being unlike anything the observers had ever seen before and completely beyond the capabilities of any known type of aircraft.
6. In view of the highly technical and unusual nature of the observations, this case is considered to be of considerable interest and worthy of very careful investigation and analysis.

FLYING SAUCERS ARE THEY REAL?

By MICHAEL A. WARREN

"Bulletin - We mention this broadcast to the effect that Dayton has been selected as the site as the saucer research center...."

"Saucers Church - Just what the saucers are, is still a mystery according to the best scientific opinion available.... Reliable sources have reported sightings of saucers at a height of 20,000 and a speed of over 900 mph. The saucers reportedly vary greatly in size, from 20 feet to 200 feet in diameter, some of the larger ones apparently carrying smaller ones on their undersides. They have been sighted at all hours of the day and night, both while stationary and in flight,... They often show up in groups, and their movements indicate intelligent control of both speed and direction..."

"The Hews - The latest and most dramatic report comes from Dayton where a Air Force officer described a saucer he had seen. This officer, whose name was not given, said that the saucer was a metallic disc about 40 feet in diameter. He stated that it hovered at about 2000 feet altitude for several minutes..."

Contrails
Brightly illuminated advertising blimps have caused many saucer reports. But balloons are not the only air-borne objects that have been mistaken for interplanetary craft. Over Durango, Colorado, early in August 1952 four T-33 jet force jets flying at 30,000 feet, so high that no sound reached the ground.

33 JULY 1952

My name is [REDACTED]. I am a Security Guard at WEPG, Las Cruces, New Mexico. On the night of 29 July 1952 at 0315 to 0400 hrs I was on duty at G Station. I was on top of the station checking the equipment. My first observation of an object in the sky was of an object of the approximate size and intensity of a star. Its velocity was similar to a meteor. It did not leave a vapor trail. The light came and went again. It traveled in an approximately thirty to fifty degrees. What aroused my interest was that it set a definite pattern. It started from north east directly overhead to the south east. I next saw it in the south west, next in the north west and back to the north east. It was not a continuous light, it came and went. At first I thought it was a shooting star but I have known of shooting stars to follow a fixed pattern. This pattern continued for about an hour when the object disappeared. I haven't seen a similar light since I fired at night and I have observed weather balloons at night also and jet planes and their velocity was to great to be any of these. I would describe this as a flight pattern rather than an object.

At approximately 0100 hrs on the 30th of July I was on duty at the landing area three miles from my original post at G Station. I observed a similar light. It appeared in a formation of stars in the south west. I would estimate the altitude at approximately 15000 ft., and it appeared at about 20 degrees and disappeared in a cloud formation. I could not estimate the lights or number of the formation.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"At about 0245 on the morning of 8 August 1952, I was looking out of my bedroom window which faces South. I noticed a bright light in the sky approaching from the South. The light seemed to be moving fast and very high. It passed directly overhead and I watched it go from South to North. After it passed overhead, I timed its progress from South to North and the total time was 3 minutes later. This light appeared to be coming from the South to the North and was moving very fast, much faster than an aircraft. I observed it for a while after it went North but did not see it again after it disappeared from sight about 5 minutes later. This light appeared to be at a very high altitude, and from the West to East it seemed to be about 15 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate that this object was traveling at about 0345 hours. I observed it for a while after that, but did not see it again."

CERTIFICATE

I certify that the following statement is true to the best of my knowledge: While in the office of the Duty Officer at White Sands Proving Ground on 1 Aug 52, I was awakened at approximately 0245 hours by the telephone ringing in the OECD AREA Headquarters.

I answered the telephone and was informed that it was the guard calling from building 1550 in the TECH AREA. He asked me to come and investigate something unusual that was going on. After I arrived, he explained the location of the building; I said that I would go. I dressed and put on my side-arms. 

Prior to leaving Port Headquarters, I telephoned the telephone operator at WSMR to tell him where I was going and that if I had not returned in half an hour, he was to call the MP's and take action for me. It being Pay Day Night, I was aware that anything could have happened.

I was very cautious in advising to the building, and was challenged by the guard. I was identified as to what the trouble was, and he said, "Sir, it looks like an extremely high, fast moving bright light from my post, but I said, "Yes, there are they? All I could see was the bright beacon from Gordon Field." I thought that could have indicated the "strange lights."

I telephoned back to Port Headquarters and told him to notify the telephone operator that I was OK and not to worry.

Several minutes went by and I did not see any "lights". The second guard just stood by into the Dying Patrol in that area.

One of the guards claimed to have seen another light but I did not see it. At 0305 hours I saw what he thought was a distant moving brush light about the size of a second class star moving in a northerly direction. I was about 300 yards outside the south gate of about 5 seconds duration. The guard said, "Did you see it Captain?" I said yes, it's moving in a northerly direction, well, no more than one second they it disappeared now repeating in that direction. I was looking, and sure enough I soon saw it again, pointing to the West. I looked, and sure enough it was moving around but there was no sound or anything indicating a aircraft. About 30 seconds later it disappeared. 

At 0305 hours one of the guards said, "There it is again." I saw it at the same time it was traveling northerly. He said it should turn and be in that direction. A few seconds later I saw it reappear traveling in a straight line from North East to East; it was observable for about 5 seconds.
