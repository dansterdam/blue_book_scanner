The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from the Project Blue Book archive, specifically a letter dated November 7, 1957 from an Attorney-at-Law in Hereford, Texas to the Air Technical Intelligence Center in Colorado. 

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sirs:

I am wondering if you have investigated this unknown and unidentified craft which has been reported by several people and the same night a few miles west of Levelland, and earlier the same night closer to Plainview. It was also reported later the same night that a similar object was seen from the motor vehicle with him about the size of a basketball. It was described as giving off a bright light, and the object when it took off near Levelland flew in a very erratic manner. I thought that you might be interested if the information had not reached you. 

Thanking you, I am

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
