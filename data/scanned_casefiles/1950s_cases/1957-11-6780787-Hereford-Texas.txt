November 7, 1957

Colorado Springs, Colorado

Dear Sirs:

I am wondering if you have investigated this unknown and unidentified air craft which has been reported by a number of people at one time a few miles North of Levelland, and the same night a few miles West of Levelland, and earlier the same night close to Palo Duro Canyon and later the same night at White Sands, New Mexico. One of the men who saw the object when it took off near Levelland lives in Hereford. There were a number of people in the motor vehicle with him when the motor went dead and the lights went out. As the air ship, or whatever it was, rose from the ground it passed directly over his vehicle and he felt considerable heat. As I thought thru you might be interested if the information had not reached you.

Last evening about 12:00 o'clock midnight, some of us saw a light which really didn't look too high but it traveled at a terrific rate of speed from the North to the South and was about the size of a football. I naturally believe it was a meteor of some sort but it was brighter than usual and traveled in a straight course and could only be seen a few seconds from the time it entered into view at the North and passed out of view at the South.

Thanking you, I am

Very truly yours,

JWJ:ny
