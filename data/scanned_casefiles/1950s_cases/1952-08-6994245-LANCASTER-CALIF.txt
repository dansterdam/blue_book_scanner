No. 11:12PM Obs:
While on patrol at location, two bright objects were observed in the southern sky, at same altitude. The objects appeared to be stationary and then suddenly they appeared to descend toward the western horizon. For approximately 5 to 7 seconds, then stop and appeared to remain in that position for a few seconds. At this time one of the objects appeared to move in an easterly direction and traveled at a moderate rate of speed and paralleled the horizon, and partially obscured by horizon for approximately 10 seconds. At this time it appeared to turn in a southerly direction and disappeared from view.

The other object remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes and started to descend toward the horizon in downward pendulum like motion and disappeared from view.

The above object was witnessed by Mr. & Mrs. [redacted], at location of Undersigned.

At 11:40PM, date, [redacted], State Fish & Game Warden, called desk and reported seeing the above objects from his home. His description of objects and their motion coincided with above statement.

At approximately 11:45PM, date, called station and reported seeing a strange object in the sky over the Lake Hughes Area. G.A.A. Palmdale, was notified of the above and they in turn notified the U.S. Air Base, George AFB.

TITLE: USSR: Rumors of Flying Saucers

It is reported from Bonn that a German expert, a witness will give information in the next issue of Der Flieger about a flying saucer which is stated to have landed in Spitzbergen and been examined by a Norwegian research group.

A few hours after the landing experts arrived and began carefully examining it. In the main, did some of the known (sic) composition. The diameter was 48 km. An outer ring was fitted with 46 jet motors which cause the disc to rotate round a spin axis in the center of which there are internal forces measuring and remote control steering. These are stated to have Russian markings. The expert found an unmangled observer and sender instrument with a plutonium core in the wreck which on all wave-lengths sent out on a frequency of 93% Hertz, unknown in any country.

The announcement has caused a great sensation in professional circles in West Germany. No confirmation has been obtained, but it is rumored that the witness is well informed since German experts, have also been consulted.

The chief of the Norwegian Defense Staff and Swedish experts have no knowledge of and are skeptical about the information.

A telegram stated that an aircraft flew over a North Norwegian district on 6 Aug 52 and release 6, apparently round, objects which continued on a northerly course at about 5,000 m height. No Norwegian aircraft were up at the time.

(b) Witness stated that his information is based on authentic data, states that at 5 a.m. on 1 Aug 52 a flying object was observed over the southern Black Forest, at Schramberg, in clear weather. Its appearance as a shining body of light traveling from East to West at high speed. The noise it made was like that of a turbine; it left a trail of light.

Witness is convinced that the apparatus is of German origin and has been appropriated by the Russians.

(c) A flying object, round like a ball at the forward edge, was seen at Rovaniemi, in Finland, on the evening of 10 Aug 52. Its color was a clear green and it left behind a red glow which soon disappeared.

Here is the text from the document:

- 2 -

1. The flight object of 28.88 meters diameter, conical to the outside, was unpiloted.

2. The silvery disc of circular shape, built from a metal of not yet known composition, carries 46 equally spaced automatic circular nodes at the periphery, which turn the disc, when in operation, with reference to the central plexi glass sphere, which houses instrumentation for measurement and remote control.

3. The discs and instruments have Russian figures and symbols.

4. The range of the disc seems to be better than 30,000 kilometers, the flight altitude 160 kilometers.

5. The aircraft, resembling the telltale flying saucer, possesses enough space for a warhead with high explosive, eventually for an A-bomb.

The Norwegian specialists believe that the disc was launched in U.S.S.R. by a transmitter or perhaps receiver breakdown at impacted on Spitsbergen and destroyed itself partly by the crash landing. The strange remotely controlled, unpiloted jet aircraft will be transported via ship to Narvik for further investigation.

The German V weapon designer, Riedel, explained when receiving a description of the disc: "That is a typical V7, on the mass production of which I have worked myself."

(END OF TRANSLATION)

REMARKS BY RIEDEL:

As usual, this report contains a nice collection of nonsense. I have, nevertheless, translated as verbally as possible. The "Unknown" 934 Hertz, the statement about range and ceiling altitude, etc., have to be consumed with a pound of salt. The last paragraph quotes name and the V7 pure invention of a direct misrepresentation of the "famous" scientist from Tel Aviv, Dr. Micha. He has stated in German papers that Germany, specifically Peenemunde, was developing a V7, which resembled the flying saucer of today.

Unidentified Flying Objects Sighted Over Lancaster, California, and Kern Valley, California were sighted stationary at times that during flying along the Kern River at a height of eight to the Earth, were observed at 1330 hours on 31 August 1952. This sighting was completed by a report from their station personnel in Palmdale, California, who observed a brilliant red light at nine miles south of Lancaster during the period 1800-1900 and sunset.

1. A Sheriff's patrol on 22387CF on 1 August 1952 observed two flying saucers, one rounding stationary over Lancaster, California, and one over Kern Valley, California. Briefly, having sighted the objects, which were round, metallic, and hovering, Sheriff's deputies made several observations. The object over Lancaster was first sighted to the south, then moved to a point above the horizon and then disappeared rapidly. The horizon bearing was slightly south of Lancaster between 220NST and 230NST. One of the witnesses in the Palmdale area sighted the object at an altitude of about 15 miles in the sky as a pilot and stated that the sighting could have lasted 15 to 20 minutes.

2. Weather in the area at the time of sighting was clear, visibility 25 miles, winds aloft from 260 at 200 knots at 20,000 feet from 250 to 15 knots.

3. Witnesses: Mr. William D. Mallette, Sheriff's Office, Palmdale, California
             Mr. E. H. Merriday, Sheriff's Office, Palmdale, California

Palmdale Air Traffic in the area of sighting was on Kevin northbound over Palmdale at 22,000 ft.

Comments of Preparing Officer:

1. Sheriff Mallette's six years experience as a Navy pilot should adequately qualify him for sighting aerial observations. Witnesses were not interrogated. Interception action was taken by the 27th Air Defense Command Division and no further sightings were reported from other areas.

INFO:
FTD-5 -8-M.... In compliance with the request of Major Herman on 2 August 1952, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sub-station was contacted on that date and the two (2) sheriff's deputies who reported sighting the "flying saucers" on 1 August 1952 were interviewed. The interviewing officer was Captain Paul E. Shoemaker of the Air Force Flight Test Center. The written report made by the two (2) deputies is enclosed with this message as well as the report of the interviewing officer. It has not been possible to correlate this report with any operation from Edwards Air Force Base. The only operation of the Air Force Flight Test Center during the approximate time period was a flight of one (1) F-94C in the general area of the sighting. However, this aircraft landed at Edwards Air Force Base at 1115 Pacific Daylight Saving Time whereas the initial sighting was reported at 1118 Pacific Daylight Saving Time. It is believed that the enclosed reports are self explanatory.

Subject: Report of interview with observers of strange flying objects, "Flying Saucers", in Lancaster, Calif. area.

Interviewer: Capt. Paul E. Shoemake, MATS

Date: 2 Aug 52

Verbal questioning substantiated the details set forth in the attached Sheriff's Office report prepared by deputy W.D. Mallette and T.W. Morrisey.

The following additional facts were obtained:

The sky was very clear; no clouds were visible in any direction and the moonlight was very bright.

The objects appeared to be white-yellow lights, elliptical in shape with hazy outlines.

Size of the objects was about that of a baseball.

No noise from the objects was discernable.

The objects appeared side by side about 20 degrees above the mountain horizon in the south. They then moved west in formation at the same time descending to about five degrees above the horizon. One of the objects remained in this position while the other returned at the same elevation to the original position and then became dimmer and disappeared from view. The one remaining in the west until 11 it disappeared below the horizon.

The horizontal movement of the objects was described as "drifting."
