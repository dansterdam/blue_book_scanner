Manitowoc where I borrowed a pair of binoculars from a neighbor. As I looked around the sky I noticed what seemed to be the lake where I could get a clear view. As the binoculars were of poor quality I could not see anything clearly. I then returned home and waited until dark for another observation, but when I went back to the lake the object was no longer visible. The next day there was a solid overcast and the object was not observed again. However, the following day the sky was clear and I searched for the object but it was no longer visible.

The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marker and a dotted line indicating the position of an object above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger view, with a person standing on a road, and two smaller sketches - one showing a detailed view of an object's position, and another showing a more simplified view of the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

NAME: [Redacted]

DATE: December 6th, 1953

I do not recall the day of the month this observation was made, but it was the day before I reported it to your office by letter. My first observation was as this country's best known series of Manitowoc. I was calling on Farmers this day and had stopped and parked my car. I mentioned to an individual having a demonstration flight of some kind and a small flight instructor in meteorology I meet generally spend some time observing the 25V force being an instructor and unexplained while engaged in such observations. I see this object in the sky. it appeared to be a material due north and took a section I view as a section. it appeared about the size of a lead pencil eraser when viewed from the ground. The color was clear and distinctive but there was a slight dust haze at high altitude which obscured the object for a few seconds. I observed the object with my watch as it is the best timepiece I have the object was in view until 12:00 noon and then went about my work. At four fifteen in the afternoon I stopped where I had a clear view southward and observed the object again. It appeared the same as before and remained in view until 12:00 midnight. The fact that this object was still in the same position after four hours and a total of twelve hours convinced me that the star or balloon theory as upper air winds would have pulled it out other the reported balloons and the rotation of the earth would have changed the apparent position of a star. The fact that this object was still in the same position to the extent that I quit work for the day and immediately drove in to report it.
