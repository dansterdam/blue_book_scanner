These three men were driving in a car approximately two miles east of Bliss, Idaho when they sighted a round object, 6 to 10 feet in diameter, approximately 100 yards north of their automobile. The object appeared to be hovering about 10 feet above ground. The three witnesses approached on foot to within a few yards of the object when it suddenly climbed 100 to 1000 feet. The object hovered in this position for about one minute and then flew south for approximately 1 miles. Informants followed the object in their automobile and when directly beneath object a second time, it covered to the west for 5 miles, where it appeared to stop.
