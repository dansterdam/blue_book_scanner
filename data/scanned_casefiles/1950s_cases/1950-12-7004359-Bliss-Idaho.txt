SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT 
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object
TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.
1. SYNOPSIS: Unidentified aerial object sighted by three (3) persons at Bliss, Idaho, object described as 6 to 10 feet in diameter. No other descriptions given. Witnesses approached object three times - original hill air weather report for Gooding, Idaho area indicates a possible lack of authenticity in reporting sighting.
2. DETAILS: 0/A AFATC, Counter Intelligence Corps, Fort Douglas, Salt Lake City, Utah, telephoned the undersigned at 1025 hours, 15 December 1950, with information as follows:
Deputy Sheriff HIPPER, Gooding, Idaho, had called S/A to report that a "light" which "burned a bright orange" had been observed in the vicinity of Bliss, Idaho, mountain area. HIPPER stated that three men were driving in a car approximately 10 miles east of Bliss in the mountain area, and when they stopped, the three men observed a bright object, 6 to 10 feet in diameter, approximately 400 yards north of their automobile. The object was described to be hovering about 10 feet above the ground. The three witnesses approached on foot to within a few yards of the object when it suddenly climbed to about 1000 feet. The object hovered in this position for about one minute and then flew south for approximately 10 miles. Informants followed the object in their automobile in an attempt to keep it in sight, but lost it at that point. Informants again followed the object and glimpsed it again following the same course to the southwest. Witnesses gave no other descriptions of object. 1-3/4 color photographs of the object were taken, but they have not yet been developed. The object was last seen heading in a southwesterly direction. Witnesses stated that the object had no apparent means of propulsion other than spinning.
