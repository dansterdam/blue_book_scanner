Dry Tortugas, Fla.                27Aug57

Analyst's Comments:

1. A review of the current Area Chart #525 (Lake Okeechobee Area), Georg f Quadrant HK, indicates that the aircraft observing the UFO was heading, and closely turned the lighthouse in the Dry Tortugas. (Photographs were 300 aged)

2. It has been gone before, that the rotating beams of these installations can create some weird and unusual moving shapes, particularly at night, and if mapping you know location. Lightning beams can also rifle through adjacent cloud banks.

3. However, as reporting officers continue that the above was taken in an unknown area, and in the opinion of these investigators that possibility that the lighthouse was responsible for the sighting and cause of the phenomenon; and request for info and investigation to CAA, ATIC, etc at Patrick AFB, Fla.


- page 14 -

Center line passed to go some road; and
ample a/c h f bottom landings in area show it
entirely, unlike object was bottom - must conclude
object "UNKNOWN" pending receipt of any later
data.
