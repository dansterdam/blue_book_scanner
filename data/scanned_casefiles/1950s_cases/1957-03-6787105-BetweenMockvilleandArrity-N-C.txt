PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT OF PAN AMERICAN AIRLINES CAPTAIN ON 9 MARCH 1957

1. There is no compelling reason to believe that the object was other than a "bolide," commonly referred to as a "fireball." These are very rarely encountered, but the object conforms exactly with the description of fireball reports received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center during the last ten years.

2. Interrogation of Captain by the New York unit of the 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron further confirms this conclusion. His detailed description, in brief, "dashing bright light with a green halo," coincides with the description given by the other crew members.

3. These objects are extremely bright, resembling magnesium flares, and, unlike meteors, do not burn themselves out in the upper atmosphere, but continue down to lower levels. Their character can be a frightening experience, particularly in a pitch-black night, as described by Captain.

4. The fact that another pilot 175 miles away observed the object at the same moment rules out aircraft and guided missiles. In addition, the Strategic Air Command reports no aircraft in the area at the time, and Patrick Air Force Base advises no operations were conducted during that period.

5. The attempt by the press to somehow relate Venus to this incident was not viable at that time and place—3:30 in the morning, at approximately 350 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida.

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF OF STAFF, USAF

1. General White has advised that you are interested in the incident reported by Pan American Airline Pilot, Captain [redacted] of an unidentified flying object which was observed about 350 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida, on 3 April 1957.

2. A preliminary investigation and evaluation of this incident has been conducted by our Unidentified Flying Object Section at ATIC at Wright-Patterson AFB.

3. On the basis of the evidence available, which includes an interview with Captain [redacted], there is some reason to believe that the object was a bolide, possibly a meteor. It was a "fireball", a bolide in a meteor-like state, instead of hovering outside the upper atmosphere. The observer was flying in the lower atmosphere, viewing the object.

REFERENCE REQUEST FOR SOME FIRM CONCLUSIONS OR EXPLANATION REGARDING
PAN AMERICAN AIRLINE INCIDENT, 9 MAR 57. ON THE BASIS OF ALL DATA AND
EVIDENCE AVAILABLE THE FOLLOWING ARE CONCLUSIONS OF ATIC:

A. THERE IS NO COMPELLING REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE OBJECT WAS
OTHER THAN A "BOLIDE", COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A "FIREBALL," THESE ARE
VERY RARELY ENCOUNTERED, BUT THE OBJECT CONFORMS EXACTLY WITH THE DESCRIPTION
OF FIREBALL REPORTS RECEIVED BY ATIC DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS.

B. INTERROGATION OF CAPT MORRIS MORNING BY THE NEW YORK
UNIT OF THE 4602D AISS, FURTHER CONFIRMS THIS CONCLUSION; HIS DETAILED
DESCRIPTION, IN BRIEF, "DAZZLING BRIGHT LIGHT - WITH A GREENISH HALO,"
COINCIDES WITH THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE OTHER CREW MEMBERS.

C: THESE OBJECTS ARE GENERALLY OBSERVED ONLY A FEW SECONDS; ARE
EXTREMELY BRIGHT, RESEMBLING MAGNESIUM FLARES; AND, UNLIKE METEORS,
GENERALLY, DO NOT BURN THEMSELVES OUT IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE, BUT
CONTINUE DOWN TO LOWER LEVELS, THEIR ENCOUNTER CAN BE A FRIGHTENING
EXPERIENCE, PARTICULARLY IN A PITCH-BLACK NIGHT, AS DESCRIBED BY CAPT

D, MISSILES AND JETS ARE RULED OUT. THE LATTER IS CONFIRMED BY A
TAC FROM SAC AND ADC, REPORTING THAT NO AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE AREA AT THE
TIME. THE FACT THAT OTHER PILOTS APPROXIMATELY 175 MILES AWAY OBSERVED
THE OBJECT AT THE SAME MOMENT, RULES OUT AIRCRAFT AND GUIDED MISSILES.

E. ALTHOUGH NO MESSAGE HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM PATRICK AFB AND
YET REGARDING "RUMAWAY" OR OTHER GUIDED MISSILE OPERATIONS, THIS POSSIBLY
SEEMS UNLIKELY. REASONS: FIRINGS ARE USUALLY CONDUCTED DURING THE DAY
AND REQUIRE IMMEDIATE, THE GENERAL RETURNS ARE NORMALLY THE SEA; AND THE COURSE
OF THE OBJECT ENCOUNTERED APPEARED TO COME FROM THE WEST.

F. THE ATTEMPT BY THE PRESS TO SOMEHOW RELATE VENUS, MUST ALSO BE
RULED OUT. THIS PLANET WAS NOT VISIBLE AT THE TIME AND PLACE, 9:30
IN THE MORNING, AT APPROXIMATELY 550 MILES EAST OF JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA.

IT IS THE RECOMMENDATION OF THIS OFFICE, THAT IN RESPONSE TO ANY
QUERIES BY THE PRESS REGARDING THIS INCIDENT, THE AIR FORCE REPLY STATE,
SUBSTANTIALLY, THE FOLLOWING:

A. ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION NOW AVAILABLE THE PILOT UNDOUBTEDLY
ENCOUNTERED AN OBJECT VERY RARELY SEEN, A "BOLIDE" OR "FIREBALL". THIS
COINCIDES WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS IDENTIFIED AS "FIREBALLS"
RECEIVED BY ATIC OVER A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS.

B. THE FACT THAT THE OBJECT WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSERVED BY ANOTHER
AIRCRAFT 175 MILES TO THE REAR RULES OUT GUIDED MISSILES AND AIRCRAFT.
(THIS IS TO COMBAT THE PROPONENTS OF "FLYING SAUCERS" AND SOVIET MISSILE
AND AIRCRAFT "MISINFORMATION" OUR SHORES.)

C. THESE CONCLUSIONS WERE CONCURRED WITH BY A WELL-KNOWN ASTRONOMER
AND ASTROPHYSICIST FROM THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY, TO
WHICH THE RECORD WAS SUBMITTED FOR HIS INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

MEMORANDUM FOR GENERAL WATSON

SUBJECT: Conclusions Regarding Pan American Airline UFO Incident,
9 March 1957

1. Reference Commander's request to investigate for some firm conclusion of explanation regarding this incident to be submitted to his office by not later than 1000 hours, Thursday, 14 March 1957; also, Memorandum, substantiality same subject, dated 13 March 1957.

2. Results of priority requests for investigation to pertinent USAF bases and other interested agencies have now been received. Denver, Long, Griffiss calls were continuously received directly from 4602d ARS, SAC, and the Eastern Air Defense Force in response to ATIC's request for further action. On the basis of all data and evidence available the following are this office's conclusions:

3. There is no compelling reason to believe that the object other than a "fireball", commonly referred to as a "fireball". These very rarely concentrated, but the object conforms exactly with the description of fireball reported forward by ADC during the last ten years.

4. Interrogation of Capt [illegible] this morning by the New York office of the 4602d ARS, further confirms this conclusion. He detailed certain observations which he derived a clear insight established with the description given by the pilot and other crew members.

5. These objects are generally observed only a few seconds, are extremely bright, resembling tungsten flares; and, while intense, continue down to low levels. Typical observations, particularly in pitch-black night, as described by Capt Van Winkle.

6. Meteor and data are ruled out. The latter is confirmed by data from SAC, reporting that no aircraft were in the area at the time. The report states that 175 miles may observed the object at the moment, rules out aircraft, and points to other details.

7. Although no message has been received from Keesler AFB as yet regarding further guided missile operation, this possibility remains unlikely. Reasons: firings are usually conducted during the day and seldom might the general firing on towards the SE, and the course of the project occurred generally to be from South to North.

Memorandum for General Watson, 14 Mar 57

1. The attempt by the press to somehow relate Venus, must also be ruled out. This planet was not visible at that time and place: 3:30 in the morning, at approximately 350 miles West of Jacksonville, Florida.

2. Of significance is the fact that our conclusions and available data was submitted to the Associate Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for review and analysis. To firmly concur: his comments and analysis are attached.

3. It is the recommendation of this office, that in response to any queries by the press regarding this incident, the Air Force briefly state, substantially, the following:

a. On the basis of information now available the pilot undoubtedly encountered a object very rarely seen, a "fireball" or "Fireball." The description given by the crew coincided with the description of objects identified as "Fireballs" received by ATIC over a period of ten years.

b. The fact that the object was simultaneously observed by another aircraft 175 miles to the west rules out guided missiles and aircraft. It in some sense represents "flying saucers" and Soviet missile and aircraft one.

c. These conclusions were concurred with by a well-known astronomer and astrophysicist from the Fort Patterson Air Development Center, Wright Patterson Observatory, in which the report was submitted for his independent review.

STATEMENT BY DR. HYNEK

Following prepared for Captain Gregory after an examination of preliminary reports on case of 9 March 57:

a. Bolides, or fireballs, differ from ordinary meteors in that they are very much brighter (sometimes transforming night into temporary day) and appear like a magnesium flare hurling through the lower atmosphere, and in that they persist to much lower levels in the atmosphere. Predominantly white-yellow in color, these often have orange and greenish tints intermixed. A bolide is generally a mass of meteoric material that ignites through friction with the earth's atmosphere. It becomes visible at heights above 50 miles but, unlike an ordinary meteor, does not burn out in the air but frequently persists until it crashes to earth.

b. A close encounter with such an object is an extremely rare occurrence, and represents a frightening experience. However, astronomical records show that people who have observed real fireballs (and the majority of people don't see one in a lifetime) generally underestimate their distance. There are cases on record in which two observers 200 miles apart both reported the flaming object to have landed "just beyond the hill" or "in the next field."

c. A fireball appears to travel at uncommonly high speeds (actually travel at 6-40 miles per second) and the great apparent angular rate leads even the best observers unconsciously to regard object as very much closer than it actually was. A typical fireball lasts from a few seconds to 10 or 20 at most.

d. In present instance, a pilot 175 miles away saw it simultaneously, it lasted 5 seconds, and it had the appearance of a flare. Even the greenish color reported fits the pattern of a typical, but rare, observation of a bolide.

e. One case of a bolide comes to mind in which a truck driver, late at night, drove the truck completely off the road as a result of the light received by a fireball sighting, a fireball that landed several hundred miles from the truck.

f. There is therefore no basic evidence that contradicts the hypothesis that the Pan American flight had an encounter (and perhaps at some distance) with a bolide. The reported fact that object passed beneath right wing is explainable by the fact that bolides do crash to earth and do often appear to perform a low, nearby horizontal path.

Here is the text from the document:

g. However, although the evidence is not contradictory, and although it appears probable that the sighting was due to a bolide, the possibility of a guided missile or flare is, of course, not ruled out, but all available information does not indicate the presence of such at the time of sighting - 3:30 A.M.

REPORT ON SIGHTING

This incident received wide newspaper mention. The Research Section has investigated it, as special representatives of NICAP, as well as for CSI, and the following account is the result.

A few minutes before midnight on March 8, 1957, Captain [redacted] took his airliner up from Idlewild Airport, bound to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Co-pilot [redacted], Flight Engineer [redacted], and stewardesses [redacted] completed the crew on Pan American Airlines Flight 257. There were 44 passengers aboard. The flight was routine, except that it was necessary to keep to the west of the normal flight course in order to avoid a storm center farther out in the Atlantic.

At 3:33 a.m. (EST) the plane far out over the Atlantic, about 650 miles to the east of Jacksonville, Florida, flying at 19,000 feet on a south-by-east heading (between 160° and 175° true). At this point, the flight abruptly ceased to be routine. About 80° to their right, [redacted] and Washuta simultaneously saw a brilliant light. At first, he was later uncertain about this detail. At any rate, it seemed to "come out of nowhere," and immediately assumed the appearance of a round, brilliant greenish-white "spotlight," almost as large as a full moon.

The light appeared "contained," having a clear and well-defined edge; Washuta described it as "rim-like" around the edges. This "rim" seemed to reflect a greenish color, while the center was a brilliant white. It looked like a spotlight directed to the front of them, so that they were not looking directly into the source of light.

[redacted] first thought was that it might be a jet interceptor with a spotlight in the nose, but he immediately rejected this idea because of the brilliance of the light, and "because they (interceptors) always come at least by twos - one pulling alongside of you ready for action," the other throwing a spotlight on your identification markings from a distance to find out who you are.

The object seemed to be of about airplane size, and no more than a half-mile away (an erroneous impression, as he discovered later). It was exactly level with him, and apparently heading horizontally across the nose of his plane, on a collision course. "Then two seconds after first seeing it," he pulled the plane up and to the left in a violent evasive maneuver to avoid possible collision; the plane climbed 150 feet in a matter of seconds. In concentrating on handling the plane, he lost sight of the object. (The news accounts reported that V.P., saw the object "slip by under my right wing." (Actually, [redacted] explains, this was not so: the object was hidden from his sight by the right wing as it lifted.)

Washuta, who was seated in the right of the cockpit, had a better view of the light, and reportedly observed it for about four seconds, after which it "went out." By the time [redacted] righted the aircraft, the light was no longer to be seen. Neither the co-pilot, busy with the navigation instruments, nor any of the passengers, had seen it.

In the cabin, there was pandemonium. All those who had not had their seat belts fastened had hit the ceiling of the cabin when the tail dropped, and three people were more or less seriously injured: Mrs. [redacted] of Philadelphia, who appeared to have a broken rib; Mrs. [redacted] with a possible concussion; and one [redacted] Soto, injuries unspecified.

Miss and the co-pilot tried to assuage the panic in the cabin, but it was calm reassuring voice over the loudspeaker that was most effective in settling the passengers. The knowledge that a UFO had been responsible for their distress seemed to calm their agitation. (This erroneously reported that, according to passengers, a strong light "like a hundred suns" filled the cabin of the aircraft.)

Immediately following the incident, radio suddenly came alive: at least six other aircraft had seen the object. All were flying roughly SSE on the same route, and they occupied an area, from north to south, more than 300 miles long.

About 150 miles to the north of, at 31° 35' N, 70° 50' W, was Capt., piloting PAA's Flight 269 at 19,000 feet. Capt. and Flight Engineer saw the object to the WSW, as did and described it as arcing upward and then falling slightly in a concave trajectory as it moved on an apparently ESE course. According to the press, described it as being "almost a magnesium flash, white with pale greenish tints around it ... At first I thought that it was a flare, then I thought it could be another of those 'mis-guided' missiles. I saw it for about five seconds - it must have been moving at a terrific speed."

Flying 15 minutes ahead of Capt. D, piloting PAA's Flight 257-A at 15,000 feet, did not notice the object. tion as 30° N, 70° 10' W.)

Some 180 miles to the southeast of, at 28° 20' N, 66° 15' W, was PAA Flight 215, flying at 17,000 feet. Capt. and Flight Engineer saw the object, again to the west of them. "It appeared first as a bright light, traveling fast ... it grew in intensity until it was exceedingly brilliant for a moment as it passed, then it seemed to fade." Its angular size, to yland as to was "as large as a full moon at the zenith." It was greenish-blue at the perimeter, blending into a white center. He said it "looked at first as though it were coming directly toward us on our flight level. It either veered slightly, or our original impression was in error, as it slanted diagonally across our starboard quarter descending, and seemed to 'go out.' As it passed, there was a definite reddish tinge to the tail or rear portion, and a piece seemed to fall off, was ejected. The portion that dropped off was 10% the size of the whole, and was definitely reddish in color." "Wyland had the object in view from two to five seconds."

About 220 miles SSE of Van Winkle, at roughly 27° N, 69° 20' W (650 miles east of West Palm Beach) was PAA Flight 215-A, piloted by Capt. and flying at 19,000 feet, the same altitude as and did not see the object reported by the other pilots, but he and second engineer, almost two hours earlier, saw something identical. Flight engineer, saw the object(s) involved in both incidents.

According to the object seen at 3:33 a.m. - observed by all the other pilots - was seen to the west of his plane and appeared to be going parallel to his direction. He said it seemed a large as a dime held at arm's length." The second engineer, who called attention to the phenomenon, estimated that it was in view for two or three seconds. Round, it had no ragged edges - "smooth" was for 10 - and was a brilliant greenish-white in color. He saw a slight projection at the rear that detached itself and turned red as it fell. At this point, the main portion began to arc downward at a slight angle, and then suddenly went out. He did not think the object was a meteor.

19.

Almost two hours earlier, about 12:45 a.m., while Flight 215-A was in the vicinity of Delta Oscar (a positional marker located off the Carolinas), and [redacted] had seen a similar object "smaller than a full moon," according to a streaking north or NNW. This object was also due west, or almost due west, of their position. It moved in a completely horizontal trajectory, and had a red tail-like projection, which suddenly dropped off, and fell "like a flare."

The main part, which was green, continued in a straight line and passed out of [redacted]'s range of vision. [redacted] who was seated on the right side of the cockpit, looked back as it passed, and thought he saw it quickly disappear into clouds; however, a later check indicated that there were few, if any, clouds in the area.

Returning to the 3:33 a.m. object, three other aircraft are reported to have observed this another Pan-American Flight (unidentified); the pilot of an Eastern Airlines plane who thought the object was a two-stage rocket; and one Trans-Caribbean pilot who said it was a meteor. We have not been able to get in touch with any of these pilots.

It is quite clear from the testimonies of the pilots that the object they saw was much farther away than they at first realized. Note that over a 300-mile base-line, all of them saw it to their west or southwest; that it appeared to be moving in roughly the same direction relative to all observers; and that its angular measurement from all of these widely-separated points was approximately half a degree. These circumstances obviously indicate an exceedingly large object seen at a distance measured in the hundreds of miles. The nearest possible location for the appearance-point pertted by the geometry is at about 29° N, 78° W. This point is 80° to the right of a 160° heading for [redacted] (assuming this is 165° true, not magnetic), and places the object about 250 miles from Wyland, and somewhere more than 100 miles from [redacted]. However, since it appeared no larger to [redacted] at 300, 17, 300 to 100 miles so close to all the planes, it is not very plausible; something like himself has calculated that it was from 300 to 800 miles distant from him. An angular measurement of one-half degree at four hundred miles gives the object a diameter in excess of three miles; but such calculations are misleading when applied to luminous bodies, which always appear larger than they are.

This large scale of the phenomenon is highly suggestive of a meteoric fireball. However, it should be noted that none of the four witnesses [redacted] who have interviewed believed that it was a meteor. [redacted] said he has seen some extremely spectacular meteors, but none has ever resembled this object. The absence of any visible tail; the difference in quality between this "contained" light and a flaming fireball; and its substantially horizontal trajectory at unreasonably low altitudes, seem different from what would be expected of a meteor. And the chances against seeing two such remarkably similar "meteors" over the same area within the span of two hours are "astronomical."

On the other hand, the object appeared for only five seconds at the most - typical of meteors; it exhibited no sort of controlled maneuver; and the wide area over which it was observed is typical of fireballs rather than of UFO phenomena.

One is inclined to say that this was neither a "normal" UFO nor a "normal" fireball. Can it be classified as a "green fireball"? It was certainly not a deep really-green in color, but the behavior was very similar (cf. Puggeli, pp. 72-3,73). There is a large group of sightings strikingly similar to this one, some of them in

this same area. On May 8, 1952, at 4:30 a.m., a pilot had a near-collision with a similar object while en route to San Juan. (See The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, by Ruppelt, p. 178-80.) On April 23, 1954, several PAA pilots saw an "object" in an orange-green light with a "Flying Saucer Conspiracy," by Keyhoe, p. 133.) Auriphebo Simoes is one of those who have seen such a "Fireball"! (O Disco Voador, #3).

And on March 25, 1957 - not three weeks after this report - Capt. piloting PAA Flight from San Juan to New York, had a daytime sighting along the same route. (Details on this observation are not being sought.)

(Note on sources: Besides the data secured directly from four of the witnesses, additional information on the March 9 sighting was gleaned from the N. Y. Times, 3/10 (UP 3/9); N. Y. Mirror 3/10 (AP 3/9); N. Journal-American, 3/9 (INS) and 3/11 (INS by ); and numerous other papers carrying substantially the same wire accounts. Our thanks go also to Bill Nash of PAA and Chris Piantages of Riddle Airlines for their valuable assistance.)
