PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
OF SAN AMERICAN AIRLINE CAPACITY
ON 9 MARCH 1957

1. There is no compelling reason to believe that the object observed that night by the pilot of San American Airline Capacity and his co-pilot was other than a meteor, but the object conforms exactly with the description of fireball reports received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center during the last two years.

2. Interrogation of Captains (...) by the New York units of the 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron further substantiates this conclusion. His detailed description, in brief, of "a bright light with a green halo," coincided with the description given by the other crew members.

3. These objects are extremely bright, resembling premium grade and while objects. They continue to descend at a very high but controlled rate of speed, frequently in a pitch-black night, in almost vertical-like descent.

4. The fact that another pilot 17s miles away observed these same objects at the same time would indicate that the aircraft and guided missiles in the area at the time, and Patriot Air Force Base. advises no operations were conducted at that section.

5. The attempt by the press to connect this sighting with alleged relates Venus was not visible at that time and place. This was not visible at the time and place reported, at approximately 5:30 in the morning, at an approximate cost of $2,000,000.

FILING COORDINATION
AFOIN-4 MEMORANDUM FOR GENERAL WATSON
SUBJECT: Conclusions Regarding Pan American Airline UFO Incident, 9 March 1957
AFOIN-4X28 1. References Captain's request to understand for some film con- cerning Pan American Airlines incident, to be submitted to his unit. AFOIN-4X3 2. As requested, no film concerning this incident is known to his unit, and the matter has been substantially researched, dated 13 March 1957.
AFOIN-4X13 3. Results of a priority priority are of investigations performed by USAF on Pan American incident, AFOIN-4 4. The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force and the Assistant Air Defense Force is response to USAF to Capt's request for any action and evidence available has been reviewed. Following are the office's conclusions: 
AFOIN-4 a. There is no known film footage captured regarding this incident.
AFOIN-4 b. There is no evidence that any unknown objects were present during the incident as described by the pilot. The objects reported were determined to be JUPITER and SATURN planets, and the location was substantially verified.
AFOIN-4 c. The pilot's report is considered acceptable and found to be routine, within standard operating procedures, and determined not to be an "unknown" as defined by Project Blue Book standards.
AFOIN-4 d. On the basis of the investigation, there is no evidence to con- firm or deny the pilot's sighting as an "unknown" aerial phenomena.
AFOIN-4 e. Regarding "unusual" or other related missile operations, this possibility has been examined and found to be unfounded during the day and time frame midnight, the general sighting are towards the SE, and to the course found to be north.

AFOIN-5
For General Watson, 14 Mar 57
The attempt by the press to somehow relate Venus, must also be ruled out. This planet was not visible as shown and placed 3360 in the morning, at approximately 350 miles west of Jacksonville, Florida.
It is advised that an analysis of this data indicates that our Earthman radar was not operating as consistently as expected, because the Astronomic Analyst of Goose Bay is convinced that this object was a satellite.
The facts are that the object was simultaneously observed by a well-known astronomer of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, to which reports are attached.
2. It is the recommendation of this office, that in response to any public release of this decision, the Air Force would firmly state, that information regarding this incident was thoroughly investigated and that the object was analyzed as being a natural Satellite.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document titled "STATEMENT BY DR. HYNEK" dated 14 March 1957. The text of the document is as follows:

Following prepared for Captain Gregory after an examination of pre- liminary reports on objects of 9 March 57:

a. Bolides, or fireballs, differ from ordinary meteors in that they are much brighter (sometimes tremendous) and appear like a magnesium flare hurting through the lower atmosphere, and in that they persist much longer visible in the atmosphere. Per dominantly white-yellow in color, these often have the orange and greenish tints illuminated, as a bolide is generally a mass of molten matter at several thousand degrees C. It becomes visible at heights above 50 miles but, unlike an ordinary meteor, does not burn out as it falls, but encounters the ground.

b. A close encounter with such an object is an extremely rare occurrence, and astronomers are generally extremely skeptical of their existence. However, astronomical records show that people who have observed real fireballs (and the majority of people don't see one all their lives) underestimate their distance. There are cases on record in which two observers 200 miles apart both reported the same object to have landed "in that beyond the hills" or "in the next county".

c. A fireball appears to travel at uncommonly high speeds (actually travel at 6-40 miles per second) and the great apparent angular rate leads even the best observers to misjudge its distance and size. Observers very much closer than 20 at most.

In the present instance, a pilot 175 miles away saw it simultaneously. Color red and green, and it had the appearance of a long cylindrical object, Even the dimensions, as reported, have the characteristics of a bolide.

One case of a bolide comes to mind in which a truck driver, late at night, sighted what he thought was an airplane making a "crash landing" and stopped to his aid. The fireball landed several hundred yards from the truck.

There is therefore no basic evidence that contradicts the hypothesis that the fan American flight was encountered (and passed beneath) a bolide.

The text reads:

However, although the evidence is not contradictory, and although it appears probable that the sighting was due to a bolide, the possibility of a guided missile or flare is, of course, not ruled out, but all available information does not indicate the presence of such at the time of sighting - 3:30 A.M.

The text reads as follows:

This incident received wide newspaper mention. The Research Section has investigated it, as special representatives of UCCR, and the following account is the result.

On March 8, 1957, Captain [REDACTED] of Airlines International, took his airliner up from Idlewild Airport, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. The co-pilot and the nine passengers completed the crew on Pan American Airlines flight 257. There were no passengers aboard. The flight was proceeding smoothly, with it was necessary to keep on the normal flight course in order to avoid a storm center that was forming out the Atlantic.

At 3:33 a.m. (EST) the plane was far out over the Atlantic, about 650 miles to the east of Jacksonville, Florida, flying at 19,000 feet on a south-by-east heading (between 165° and 175° true). At this point, the flight abruptly ceased and the plane went into a violent, evasive maneuver to avoid possible collision. According to the first officer's statement, a strange glow at first, although he was later uncertain about this detail. At any rate, it seemed to "come out of nowhere," and immediately assumed the appearance of a round, brilliant greenish-white "spotlight," almost as large as a full moon.

The object appeared "metallic" and was traveling at a clear, well-defined edge; Washuta described it as "rim-like" around the edge. This "rim" seemed to reflect a greenish color, while the center was a brilliant metallic. It looked like a "spotlight directed to the front of them, so that they were not looking directly into the source of the light.

The first thought was that it might be a jet interceptor with a spotlight in the nose, but the immediate reaction was that this idea was incorrect because of the brilliance of the light, and "because they (interceptors) always come at least by two - one climbing alongside of you ready for action. The other hovering a spotlight on your plane."

The object seemed to be of about airplane size, and no more than a half-mile away (an erroneous impression, as he discovered later). It was exactly level with his plane, on a collision course within 300 feet, and to the left in front of him. In a violent evasive maneuver to avoid possible collision, the pilot, according to his statement, "climbed and turned to the left in a violent evasive action." In doing so, he lost sight of the object.

(The news account reported that V.X. saw the object, while his co-pilot, who had a better view, observed that this was not so: the object was hidden from his sight by the flight wing as it lifted.)

Washuta, who was seated in the right-hand seat, had a better view of the light, and reportedly observed it for about four seconds, after which it "went out." By this time, the pilot had already put the plane into the evasive maneuver, and the light was no longer to be seen.

In the cabin, there was pandemonium. All those who had not had their seat belts fastened had the calling when the tail dropped; and three people were more or less seriously injured. The pilot immediately reported this incident to the Philadelphia, who appeared to have a broken rib; and one passenger to have a concussion, injuries unspecified.

UNCLASSIFIED

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report, possibly from Project Blue Book, that describes various UFO sightings.

According to the text in the document:

About 120 miles to the north of a town called MOCK VILLE at 19,000 feet, Capt. _____ and his co-pilot say the object to the VSU, and described it as pacing them and then sailing upward and then falling away in a circular fashion. They said it moved on an apparently erratic trajectory.

Flying 15 minutes ahead of the sighted object, PAA Flight 257 at 15,000 feet, did not notice the object. 

Some 180 miles to the southeast of PAA Flight 257, flying at 17,000 feet, Capt. _____ and co-pilot also saw the object, describing it as a bright light, traveling fast - it grew in intensity until it was exceedingly brilliant. Its similar size to Wayland at the summit - it was greenish-blue in color.

About 220 miles SSE of Van Nuys, at roughly 27° N, 69° 20' W (650 miles east of Wayland), PAA Flight 215 at 19,000 feet, also saw the same object.

The report also mentions that the pilots of these flights claimed to the control tower that the object was seen by all the other pilots, and a second engineer who called attention to the phenomenon, estimated that it was a word for it - and was a brilliant greenish-white in color.

Transcription of text:

Almost two hours earlier, about 12:15 a.m., while Flight 215-A was in the vicinity of Delco at a positional marker located off the Carolina coast, the pilot and co-pilot of this aircraft reported sighting an object to the west, streaking north or NNW. This object was also due west, or almost due west, of their position. It moved in a straight horizontal trajectory, and had a red tail-like projection, which suddenly drew off, and fell "like a flare."

The main part, which was green, continued in a straight line and passed out of sight. It looked back as it passed, and thought he saw it quickly disappear into clouds; however, a later closer inspection that there were "very, if any, clouds in the area."

He said he saw it for about three seconds; Smith slightly longer. Several passengers had seen it also.

Returning to the 3:33 a.m. object, three other aircraft are reported to have observed this together [an aircraft flight] (Continental); the pilot of an Eastern Airlines plane who thought the object was a two-stage rocket; and one Trans-Caribbean pilot who said it was a meteor. We have not been able to get in touch with any of these pilots.

It is quite clear from the testimonies of the pilots that the object they saw was much farther away than they at first realized. Note that over a 300-mile base-line, all of them said it to be moving or apparent to be moving at tremendous speed. The measurements from all of these widely-separated points was approximately half a degree per second, on the average. These measurements indicate a surprisingly large object seen at a distance measured in the hundreds of miles. The nearest possible location point is 250 to the right of a line heading for 288 M. 785 W. This point is 900 to the right of a line of heading for 289 M. 775 W. As we mentioned for Kiland, this true location is not indisputable, but none the less most apt. However, since it appeared no larger than a point, it is not very plausible to say that it was something like 200 to 300 miles from all the planes, thus a diameter in excess of three miles. Numerous studies which always appear larger than they are.

This large scale of the phenomenon is highly suggestive of a meteoric fireball. However, it should be noted that some of the four witnesses (whom we have interviewed) believed that it was a meteor. He said he has some explanation that it was possibly some more meteors, but none has ever resembled this object. The absence of any visible tail, the difference in quality between this incident and a firebali, and its substantilly horizontal movement are considered definitievly inconsistent with the pattern of a meteor. And the chances against seeing two such remarkably similar celestial movements over the same time span are "astronomical."

On the other hand, the object appeared for only five seconds at the most - typical of meteors; it exhibited no signs of controlled maneuvers; and the wide area over which it was observed is typical of fireballs rather than of UFO phenomena. 

One is inclined to say that this was neither a "normal" UFO nor a "normal" fireball. Can it be classified as a "green fireball"? It was certainly not a deep-purple in color, but a light rather daily-green in color, but the behavior was very similar (cf. Ruppelt, pp.57-73). There is a large group of sightings appearing to be similar to this one, some of which in their characteristics may come closer to the UFO pattern than to the fireball pattern.

this same area. On May 8, 1952, at 11:30 a.m., a pilot had a near-collision with a similar object while on an routine Air Force maneuver over this area. (See The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, by Ruppelt, pp. 178-80.) 
On April 27, 1954, several PAA pilots saw and photographed similar objects over this area. (See the article "Flying Saucers" Comprise" by L. V. Stringfield, in FATE Magazine, May, 1955, p.39.)
And on March 25, 1957 - not three weeks after the report covered in this RP - a commercial pilot, Capt. H. G. Berkowitz, making a routine flight from New York to Miami, had a sighting and filed a report on the incident. 
(Note on sources: Besides the data secured directly from four of the witnesses, additional information on the March 9, 1952 sighting was gleaned from the Times-.3/29/11 & AP 3/28) from the files of journal-American, 3/3 (INS); and the same wire accounts. Our thanks go also to Bill Nash of PAA and Chris Panteges of Riddle Airlines for their valuable assistance.)
