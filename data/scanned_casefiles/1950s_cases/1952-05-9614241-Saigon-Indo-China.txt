GROUP, INDO-CHINA

A flying saucer was observed between ten and eleven A.M. on May twenty-ninth in
the Saigon sky by a large number of people who were in the vicinity of its intersec-
tion of Van Luong and Trang Quang Duat. Among those who witnessed the rare M.
Reichenfeld, managing Director of the Comite des Gars Gras of Olngieux, and Mr.
Beaudin, Director of the Societe Commerciale des Douanes d'Indochine, it was
confirmed by the Meteorological Service that there was no mooring balloon on that
similar between ten and eleven A.M.

IN THE VIETNAM SKY
A FLYING SAUCER WAS SEEN NEAR SAIGON

Now it a flying saucer? According to rumors it was a round object, brilliant
very light and with an exceptional mobility which was seen in the sky over Saigon on
May twenty-ninth between ten and eleven A.M. local time. This "thing" did not look like any
aircraft known before in Saigon.

It was 10:30 hours while a ceremony was being held at the Saigon Port that
several airmen were blocked off to let high ranking personalities pass through the
area. Mr. Reichenfeld was driving his car on Van Luong St. At this moment he saw
something - the sky was blue with several clouds and no wind. Mr. Reichenfeld was
attracted by a round group of luminous red luminous white wave looking something in
the sky. "It was a helicopter", thought the. Reichenfeld as it started out of his
car and looked up, but in his view there was nothing.

He entered his car and continued slowly on his leftover to a point 20 meters from
the Compagnie Franc-Americaine, where again several persons, including the di-
rector, stopped and looked up. "Look!" said Mr. Reichenfeld. "What is that?" The
object going up, he observed, just look up!" He pointed to a white disk which came out
of a cloud. It was something absolutely round, whitish-gray in color, and brilliant as
metal shining in sun light. The object was moving towards another cloud. It could
be seen slowly in the very thin sky then at 45 degrees and perhaps 100 meters in
diameter of the flying saucer. I also have seen a G-20 satellite that was observing
the sky as a test of a B-29. The object was at altitude was 2,500 meters. I first
thought it was a mooring balloon which was taken around by the wind, but I could not
explain how its clouds remained in the same place. The object was so bright, I could
in an very great speed. Before seeing this, I believed in flying saucers in the
proportion of 5%... but now I recognize that the proportion is reversed 95%.

ASCENDING WITNESS

Soon and soon I said to my driver Jacques, wait a bit it is a flying saucer. But
a moment later at disappearance, while a cloud, the object, we saw was a round mass.
For several seconds it could be statically observed and during this time it did not
move a small and hardly perceptible way. In the same time it was moving in a
speed of a lot several or a meteor, such as those cases at night. It moved in a
gradually straight line and was about the size of a small metal cloud, 10 or 5 meters
in diameter.

NO WEATHER BALLOON ON THE 28TH BETWEEN 10:00 AND 11:30 A.M.

According to information from the Service Meteorologique a weather balloon was
released at 8:00 A.M. on the 28th and 56 minutes later at 9:56 A.M. The altitude of
10,625 meters and burst. The sky that day was perfectly blue with only a few clouds,
no wind, reported the Weather Station.

COMMENTS BY REPORTING OFFICER:

The above is the first imported sighting of flying saucers in Indo-China known to the office. From all indications the newspaper account seems factual. The report details although this office has been unable to locate additional observances, will mainly relate only to the first occurrence, from the personnel of the 9th para group then at Saigon at approximately 10:15 hours but did not observe the object either then or later with any outside of the Saigon Port area approximately 1/8 mile away.

Additional details are as follows:

(1) Only one object reported seen.

(2) Time sighted was 0230 hours zulu and length of time observed was approximately two minutes.
