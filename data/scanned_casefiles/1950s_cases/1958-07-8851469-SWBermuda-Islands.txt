There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report on unidentified objects sighted in the Bermuda area on July 15, 1958.

Dr. J. A. Hynek.
Report of Unidentified Objects
Sighted in Neighborhood of Bermuda on July 15, 1958.
(per U.S.A.F. Headquarters Wire of July 15)

These objects were quite possibly fireball or meteors (but which could not be exactly determined as they were not described). If they were fireball objects, they could be common enough, but were most remarkable which (not described) could be held in an hour), it is not outside the bounds of possibility.

Their varied and sometimes opposite directions would, of course, rule out any chance of their being connected with any single normal artificial satellite.

It may be interesting to note that we have three other recent reliable reports of somewhat similar unidentified objects, as follows:

Las Cruces, N.M. July 25 03 27 U.T.
Portland, Oregon August 1 09 22 
Chapel Hill, N.C. August 4 01 15

The Portland object was described from the light and sound was powerful, with the diameter and had a large orange tail. All were travelling in a north-to-east sighting. 

Also of interest, for whatever the coincidence may be worth, is the fact that the U.S.F.O. observation at Bermuda was on the same date as the Las Cruces and Portland observations, have a common denominator, or common basis period, of about 3-1/2 minutes. The Chapel Hill sighting can also be included in this time grouping, if we use this common basic period for all three observations.
