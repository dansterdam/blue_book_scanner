Dr. J. A. Hynek.                                                August 7, 1958.

Report of Unidentified Objects

Sighted in Neighborhood of Bermuda on July 15, 1958.
(per U.S.A.F. Headquarters Wire of July 15)

These objects were quite possibly fireballs or meteors (but which, would depend on size and brightness which are not described). If they were large objects, they could be fireballs and, while it would be remarkable that so many fireballs could be seen in such a short space of time (ten in half an hour), it is not outside the bounds of possibility.

Their varied and sometimes opposite directions would, of course, rule out any chance of them being connected with any single normal artificial satellite.

It may be interesting to note that we have three other recent reliable reports of somewhat similar unidentified objects, as follows:

Las Cruces, N.M.     July 25     03 27 U.T.
Portland, Oregon     August 1     08 26
Chapel Hill, N.C.    August 4     01 15

Color was not mentioned in the Las Cruces case. The Portland object changed from white to red and was almost one-fourth of the moon in size. The Chapel Hill object was one-tenth of the moon's diameter and had a large orange tail. All were travelling in a more or less easterly direction.

Also of interest, for whatever the coincidence may be worth, is the fact that the two time intervals between the last Bermuda west-to-east sighting, and the Las Cruces and Portland observations, have a common denominator, or common basic period, of about 345 minutes. The Chapel Hill sighting can also be included in this time grouping if we use one-third of this period, namely, 115 minutes, as the common period for all three intervals. (N.B. The Portland sighting time is only very approximate).
