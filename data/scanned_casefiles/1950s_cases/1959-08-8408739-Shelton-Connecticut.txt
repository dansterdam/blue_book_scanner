Dear Sirs:

It was suggested that I write to your group explaining a strange object which was sighted over Shelton, Conn. Aug 19th, by six adults of average intelligence.

At 9:10 PM EDT, looking at the sky in a southwestern direction, we sighted an object moving rapidly in a northeastern direction. After viewing it for a minute or so, we came to the conclusion it was not a shooting star or jet. We thought possibly that it might have been an artificial satellite or spent cone.

As it wobbled or spiraled at all times, length of time sighted was a good three minutes until it vanished into the horizon. Its brightness and color was that of a 1st mag. star. And orange. After it had passed overhead the color seemed to turn to a bright orange red.

Altitude was hard to determine but comparing to the stars it seemed to be among them. Surely of what it looked like in motion.

Yours truly,
[Signature]

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your letter of 24 August concerning an Unidentified Flying Object you sighted recently over Shelton, Connecticut.

Your letter contained insufficient data to allow a valid conclusion. Therefore request you complete the enclosed Air Force questionnaire in regard to this sighting and forward the completed paper to the Air Force Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,
