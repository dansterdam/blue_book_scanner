The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from "THE STRUCTION CO.", a general contractor, addressed to "Dear Sir" on August 24, 1959. The text of the document is as follows:

IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE ADVISABLE TO SIGHT OVER SHELTON CONN AVE 19th. NR. AVENUE IF INTERESTED.

AT THE 11:00 PM MEETING AT THE OFFICE IN NORWICH, WE NOTED ANY CONTRACTOR OR MANUFACTURER FOR A PRODUCT OR DEVICE WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED TO OUR ATTENTION AS HAVING BEEN AN OBJECT OF SEVERE STATE OR GOVERNMENT INTEREST OR INVESTIGATION AT SOME PRIOR TIME AS TENDING TO BE EITHER A STATE OR GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED CASE WE THOUGHT POSSESSION MIGHT BE RIGOROUSLY RESENTED OR VIEWED AS SOMEWHAT IMPROPER.

The rest of the text describes the sender's experience with a particular "object" or "device" that was apparently under government interest or investigation. However, the details have been redacted or omitted from the document.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

4 September 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 24 August concerning an Unidentified Flying Object you sighted recently over Shelton, Connecticut. 

Your letter contained insufficient data to allow a valid conclusion. Therefore request you complete the inclosed Air Force questionnaire in regard to this sighting and forward the same to the Directorate of Intelligence, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
