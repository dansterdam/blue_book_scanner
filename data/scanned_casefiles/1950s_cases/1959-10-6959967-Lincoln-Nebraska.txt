IN THEIR STATEMENTS AND GAVE A THOROUGH ACCOUNT OF THE MOVEMENTS AND ACTIONS OF THE OBJECT. THE SON IS STUDYING ASTRONOMY AND HAD BEEN POINTING OUT THE STARS TO THE PARENTS. WHILE RETURNING TO THE HOUSE MRS [REDACTED] OBSERVED THE OBJECT AND POINTED IT OUT TO THE OTHERS. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE OBJECT HAD DISAPPEARED THAT THEY THOUGHT TO REPORT IT TO THE LINCOLN AFB CONTROL TOWER. NO OTHER REPORTS OF SIGHTING WERE RECEIVED ON THE OBJECT. NO CONTROLLED TRAFFIC WAS SCHEDULED IN THE AREA DURING THIS PERIOD EXCEPT THOSE SHOOTING LANDINGS. THE OBSERVERS HAVE WATCHED JET AIRCRAFT AT HIGH ALTITUDES IN THIS AREA AND STATE THAT THIS OBJECT WAS TRAVELING MUCH FASTER THAN THE JETS. THE DESCRIPTION INDICATED A HIGH FLYING AIRCRAFT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ABRUPT, SHARP TURNS. THE PREPARING OFFICER CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors or narrative report. Begin narrative text on AF Form 112)

This report concerns the investigation of UFO sighted 7 Oct 59. It is supplemental information to UFO Report 980DCI 10-959 and is submitted to complete the request of AFO Message AGCN-4249 14-2169-L, dated 24 Oct 59.

In answer to questions contained in the messages:

(1) Observers feel it is difficult to estimate the distance traveled due to height and speed of the object but gave the approximate figures as shown on the diagram (page 2). Observers could not estimate time on each leg, however the overall time was approximately two (2) minutes.

(2) Object remained a constant size throughout viewing.

(3) Object appeared to stop only a split second at the 90° turns.

(4) The 90° turns were very abrupt.
