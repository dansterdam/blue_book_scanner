This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of the Air Force, Star Message Division, titled "INCOMING". The document describes an incident where a son was studying astronomy and had been pointing out the stars to his parents. The object they observed made sharp turns and appeared to be traveling much faster than jets. The observers watched the object from a high altitude, and the preparing officer could not explain the sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

AP IN:  18473 (17 OCT 59)

IN THEIR STATEMENTS AND GAVE A THOROUGH ACCOUNT OF THE MOVEMENTS AND ACTIONS OF THE OBJECT. THE SON IS STUDYING ASTRONOMY AND HAD SEEN POINTING OUT THE STARS TO THE PARENTS. WHILE RETURNING TO THE HOUSE MRS. OBSERVED THE OBJECT AND POINTED IT OUT TO THE OTHERS. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE OBJECT HAD DISAPPEARED THAT THEY THOUGHT TO REPORT IT TO THE LINCOLN AFB CONTROL TOWER. NO OTHER REPORTS OR SIGHTINGS WERE RECEIVED ON THIS OBJECT. NO CONTROLLED TRAFFIC WAS SCHEDULED IN THE AREA DURING THIS PERIOD EXCEPT THOSE SHOOTING LANDINGS. THE OBSERVERS HAVE WATCHED JET AIRCRAFT AT HIGH ALTITUDES IN THE AREA AND STATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS TRAVELING MUCH FASTER THAN THE JETS. THE DESCRIPTION INDICATED A HIGH FLYING AIRCRAFT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ABRUPT, SHARP TURNS. THE PREPARING OFFICER CAN GIVE NO EXPLAINATION OF THE SIGHTING.
