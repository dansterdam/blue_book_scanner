1.    Mr. [redacted], Woodland Hills, California, who is employed as an Engineering Planner by North American Aviation, Inc., Santa Suzanna Rocket Test Laboratory, telephonically advised this office that on the evening of 11 December 1952, at approximately 6:00 P.M., while in their back yard, he first noticed an object which appeared to go in a vertical and upward direction across the sky. This object appeared from the South, heading in a Northeastern direction, leaving a long trail of Fire. A yellowish-reddish cast, very similar to the exhaust gas which sees daily from rockets being tested at the aforestated Test Laboratory. The object appeared to be visible for about 15 to 20 seconds before diminishing but shooting upward at a terrific velocity. It was concentrated at its source; like a dart of an arrow, fanned out toward the end.

2.    This report is forwarded in accordance with provisions of paragraph 7e(2)(b), AFI 200-5.

    About a month previously at the same campus about 5:20 PM was outdoors looking at the stars. The object was not as fast moving, but was the same in appearance. Noticed it in the same direction toward the night sky, but I did not see it as clearly. Possibly similar.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? I feel the object must have had a hard surface like steel or metal in some piece or size. Speed, it moved. It was a very fast moving, not really a relatively gliding and well-formed and well-known object with no apparent shape. The object was moving. This path was the view to be seen to be a very heavy object moving under its own power. Generally, quite unusual.

Dear Sir:

Mr. [redacted] and myself are teachers at [redacted] last night, on returning from the diner, we stopped to look at the constellation Orion. Suddenly we noticed a meteor-like flash to the left and coming from the left of Orion. Immediately after the disappearance of the flash we saw a star-like object moving from the right into Orion, passing just above his sword. The object no sooner passed the sword when it hastily reversed its course, crossed through the sword, and headed toward the right in an erratic path, moving up and down, until it attained a steady course. Then it continued to move swiftly toward the right.

Mr. [redacted] and myself served in the armed forces. He was an ensign in the navy and I was a soldier in Illinois.

We were led to believe this object was not an airplane because:
a. There were no red or green lights or flashing of lights
b. There was almost no turning arc
c. The speed w-s far beyond anything we had ever observed
d. The chances of course were so marked and swift that we believe it could not have been an airplane.

Very truly yours,
