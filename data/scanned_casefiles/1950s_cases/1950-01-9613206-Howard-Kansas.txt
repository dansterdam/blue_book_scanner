There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force study of unidentified flying objects. The document discusses a report from Olathe, Kansas on January 25, 1950, where a weather officer stated that the weather on that day was clear with good visibility, and that no further reports concerning any unidentified aerial objects had been received. The document is marked as "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom.
