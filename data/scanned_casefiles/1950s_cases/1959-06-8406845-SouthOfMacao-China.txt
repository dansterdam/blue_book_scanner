AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(FROM [REDACTED])
REPORT NO.
(PLACE) ATIC
DATE 1262A29l
PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. On 21 June 1959, a RB-66 mission [REDACTED] at [REDACTED] sighted
four (4) pairs, total of eight (8), unidentified objects. The ECM operator
drew attention to the case by intercept of a suspected manual signal. This
signal, upon hand analysis at this PACAF IEC, has since been determined to be a commu-
nication radio not associated with the objects. Hearing of the signal to beam the
radio did not coincide until totally beyond the area the objects were sighted. Ob-
jects were sighted by the pilot and gunner. The objects were described as round
and of a dark color. The four pairs were disposed over an area of an estimated fifty (50) miles parallel to the 130 course. Separation of the objects in each pair
was estimated at 200 - 300 yards. Upon approach, the second pair moved noticeably closer together. Size was compared to a radome, 25-30 feet diameter,
to 100-200 feet diameter. The radius was observed approximately 1/2 the diameter
from the objects, round shaped with no charging type. IEC-based intercepts over
the objects at 36,000 feet. One ship was sighted approximately 3 - 5 miles off
to the wind of line of objects. Wake from the ships was observed although no
wake or other information available on the objects. Ships and objects were mov-
ing in a SW direction from appearance.

2. On 3 July 1959, another RB-66 crew, mission [REDACTED] at [REDACTED].
The gunner observe the group of 16 plus another group of eight (8) objects.
Objects were irregularly grouped in pairs along the flight heading of 333 degrees
covering an area of about five (5) miles. Seven pair of binoculars were used dur-
ing observation and objects appeared cream colored, or oblong shapes, 10-
to 20 feet length and 200-300 feet width estimated. Objects were viewed for thirteen
(13) minutes at 36,000 feet. Objects in each pair were estimated 300 feet apart.
No shadows, wake or other features were observed.

3. On 8 July 1959, a KB-66 with same crew which made 3 July sighting, mission
[REDACTED], at [REDACTED] sighted five (5) objects through a 9/10 undercast.
These objects were sighted from 36,000 feet for a three minute period. Objects
appeared to be flashing some of an estimated sixty (60) feet length, Fifteen (15)
feet width, the pilot and gunner made the sighting at a distance of approximately
Five (5) miles. Objects were described as brown in color although detailed fea-
tures could not be determined.

4. KB-29 film of mission [REDACTED] revealed a radar return on frame 8100 at
[REDACTED] which shows area and location of the objects relative to the aircraft.
Film for missions [REDACTED] is forwarded for comparison, although the
latter films do not show the object’s reflection due to high gain.

5. Comments of Reporting Officers: Debriefing and further questioning of the
pilots and crews failed to add significant details to information previously re-
ported. All crews of observation concluded a detailed description even though
the pilots were well experienced in flying in Far East.

HAVE BEEN CAST 1757 FT AWAY FROM A POINT VERTICALLY UNDER THE

OBJECT.  FURTHER, THE SHADOW WOULD HAVE HAD A LENGTH APPROX 9 TIMES

THE VERTICAL DIMENSION OF THE OBJECT.  (5) ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT

THEY ARE CAPTIVE BALLOONS SUPPORTING A LINE STRUNG BETWEEN THE TWO

SHIPS.  THIS LINE COULD BE USED FOR CLOSED COMMUNICATION OR SOME

OTHER PURPOSE.  THE ABSENCE OF MOTION, AND THE REGULARITY OF

INTERVAL BETWEEN PAIRS TENDS TO SUBSTANTIATE THIS POSSIBILITY.

(6) THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE OBJECTS BEING LOW STRATUS SCUD CLOUDS

MUST NOT BE DISCOUNTED.  (7) FURTHER DATA TO HELP ANSWER THE

QUESTIONS BROUGHT UP IN PARAS 1, 2, 3, & 4 IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO

MAKE FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THIS INCIDENT.  THE ADDITIONAL INFO

REQUESTED IS AS FOLLOWS: (A) WEATHER (B) DURATION OF SIGHTING

(C) DID THE OBJECTS DISAPPEAR? IF SO, HOW? (D) MOTION OF

OBJECTS, IF ANY.  (E) METHOD OF DETERMINING THE SIZE AND HEIGHT

The document contains several photographs or illustrations. These are not clear, but I can describe their general shapes and appearances:

1. At the top right corner of the page, there appears to be a blurry, elongated object.
2. In the middle of the page, on the left side, there is an illustration or photograph resembling a bullet or missile-like object with stabilizing fins at the rear.
3. In the lower section of the page, two separate images (one above the other), both showing elongated objects with one appearing to have a tapered end and the other having a more cylindrical shape with a distinct head and fins or protrusions at the rear.

Now, I will provide the text from the document as an OCR output:
