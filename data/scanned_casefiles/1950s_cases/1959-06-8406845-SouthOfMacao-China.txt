AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency)    REPORT NO.    12648-PL    PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. On 21 June 1959, a B-56 mission PO-056 at 39.CHI123x 22N46 altitude four (4) pairs, total of eight (8), unidentified objects. The GCI operator detected a terrain to terrain visual contact. A second manual radar signal, upon analysis at the PACAF ECM, has since been determined to be a common electronic jamming signal. The B-56 who did not occur until well beyond where the objects were sighted. Objects were sighted by the pilot and gunner. The objects were described as round and of a dark color. The four pairs were approximately 9/10 miles parallel to the B-56 course. Separation of the objects in each pair was one (1) mile, and in the second pair, able closer together. Size was compared to an B-radome, 5-10 feet diameter, to 1/2-CO. Deck diameter, from the objects, ground speed did not change although B-56 passed directly over the objects at 18,000 feet. One (1) was a thousand yards 3 miles off either end of line of objects. Make from the ships was observed although no take or other information available on the objects. Ships and objects were moving in a northwesterly direction.

2. On 3 July 1959, another B-56 crew, mission PO-061 at XC98N1123x, 20,000, a group of sixteen (16) unidentified objects were observed by the pilot. The radar showed the group of sixteen (16) objects, color was periodically grouped in pairs along the flight heading of 335 degrees covering an area of about five (5) miles. Another binoculars were used during observation and objects appeared green colored, or oval or oblong shape, about 30 feet length and 50-100 feet width estimated. Objects were viewed for thirteen (13) minutes to 30,000 feet. Objects in each pair spaced 500 feet apart. No shadows, wake or other features were observed.

3. On 4 July 1959, a B-56, with same crew which made 3 July sighting, mission PO-062 at 20,381N1123x, 31,000, altitude from 36,000 feet for a three minute period. Objects appeared to be similar to previous sighting. Boats of an estimated sixty (60) feet length, fifteen (15) feet width, the pilot and gunner made with sighting at a distance of approximately five (5) miles. Objects were described as brown in color although detailed features not defined.

4. RC-2 film of mission PO-056 revealed a radar return on frame 3180 at 315.02w which shows area and location of three objects relative to the aircraft. Film or mission PU-062 and PU-062 to forward for annotation, although the latter films do not show the object reflection due to high gain.

5. Comments of reporting officer: Debriefing and further questioning of the pilots and crews failed to add significant details to information previously reported. A detailed observation of a detailed report even though the pilots are well experienced in flying in Far East.

ATTN 1318J, YOUR SECRET MSG 1318 9A2034, DTD 22 JUNE 59, REPORTING THE SIGHTING OF 8 SPHERICAL OBJECTS. THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE FORWARDED FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:

(1) FROM 34,000 FT IT WOULD BE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE ALTITUDE OF OBJECTS WHOSE IDENTITY OR SIZE IS UNKNOWN.

(2) AN OBJECT 25 FT IN DIAMETER, FROM 34,000 FT SUBTENDS AN ANGLE OF LESS THAN ONE MIL. WITHOUT THE USE OF BINOCULARS OR OTHER OPTICAL AID, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE COLOR OR ANY FAIR DESCRIPTION.

(3) FROM 34,000 FT IT WOULD BE EQUALLY HARD TO DETERMINE SHADOWS FROM THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES WITHOUT SOME DISTINCTIVE COLOR (I.E. FIRE GLOW ORANGE), OR UNLESS THE SHADOW HAD A HALO, IF THE OBJECT IS AS SMALL AS 25 FT IN DIAMETER AND NO MORE THAN 500FT FROM THE SURFACE AS REPORTED.

(4) THE SUN AT 0546 LOCAL TIME WAS ONLY APPROX 6 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND THE SHADOW OF AN OBJECT AT 500 FT ALTITUDE WOULD

FROM: ATIC, WAFB, OHIO

HAVE BEEN CAST 1757 FT AWAY FROM A POINT VERTICALLY UNDER THE OBJECT. FURTHER, THE SHADOW WOULD HAVE HAD A LENGTH APPROX 9 TIMES THE VERTICAL DIMENSION OF THE OBJECT. (5) ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT THEY ARE CAPTIVE BALLOONS SUPPORTING A LINE STRONG BETWEEN TWO SHIPS. THIS LINE COULD BE USED FOR CLOSED COMMUNICATION OR SOME OTHER PURPOSE. THE ABSENCE OF MOTION, AND THE REGULARITY OF INTERVAL BETWEEN PAIRS TENDS TO SUBSTANTIATE THIS POSSIBILITY.

(6) THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE OBJECTS BEING LOW SPARSE GOOD CLOUDS MUST NOT BE DISCOUNTED. (7) FURTHER DATA TO HELP ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BROUGHT UP IN PARAS 1, 2, 3 & 4 IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THIS INCIDENT. THE ADDITIONAL INFO REQUESTED IS AS FOLLOWS: (a) WEATHER (b) DURATION OF SIGHTING (c) DID THE OBJECTS DISAPPEAR? IF SO, HOW? (d) MOTION OF OBJECTS, IF ANY. (e) METHOD OF DETERMINING THE SIZE AND HEIGHT OF THE OBJECTS.
