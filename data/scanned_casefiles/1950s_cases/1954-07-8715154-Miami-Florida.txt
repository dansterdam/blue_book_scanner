Memorandum

From: BROWN, M. J., GEC, USN
To:   Chief of Staff, U. S. Naval Base, Key West, Florida

Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects; report of
Time: 0340 - 29 July 1954

Witnessed by: [redacted], SA, USN

Location: Position of YTB-543; 4 miles, bearing 307° true from
"The Elbows" lighted beacon in the Florida Reef's

General Situation: Aboard USS YTB-543 with tow enroute Miami, Florida,

While steaming south on course 205° true, speed 6.5 knots, approximately
3 miles off of, and parallel to the contour of the Florida Reef, I was
on the Starboard wing of the Bridge with a pair of binoculars and stop
watch in my hands observing the general layout of the reef, its lights
and beacons, and of the merchant vessel close aboard and about to start-
board, also steaming on a southerly course, satisfying myself of the
safety of YTB-543 and its tow in relation to the reefs and the merchant
vessel. Upon being satisfied of the safety of the YTB-543 and its tow,
I then turned my attention forward, off the starboard bow, preparing to
observe and check the characteristics of "The Elbows" lighted beacon
with the stop watch for further proof and identification when suddenly
there appeared a breathtaking phenomena in the sky, slightly above and to
the east of "The Elbows" lighted beacon. Exclaiming to [redacted] USN, Helmsman on watch in the wheel house and at
the same instance throwing the binoculars to my eyes and in line with
the object and unconsciously starting the stop watch, (which results from
years of practice), I followed the object from a SSW direction in what
appeared to be a long, but slight, semicircle swing across the bow (south
to north) and thence veering off sharply to the NE, off the port quarter
in the NE, off the port quarter. There were 3 vessels known to be in the
vicinity at the time and it is assumed and taken for granted that one or
more of these vessels sighted this phenomena, especially the vessel
immediately to my starboard. The general overall reaction condition at
that time was fair to good, with fair being from SW through east to NE and
good being from SW through west to NE. Sky was three-tenths covered with
clouds, mostly of which were on the horizon and to the elevation of
position angle 10° to 15° high. In the east these clouds were of
alto-cumulus in the southwest to cumulo-nimbus, alto-cumulus and nimbo-
stratus in the northeast, to alto-cumulus and stratus-cumulus in the north-
east. A sheet of veil of alto-stratus was predominate in the cloud forma-
tion and was very visible above the basic clouds. There were rain squalls

with occasional lightning in the SE and NE. The cloud formation in the
west from NW through west to NE were of cumulus, cumulo-nimbus and alto-
cumulus with allowance. There were rain squalls in the NW to NE during
was observed. Above the position angle of 15° were occasional scattered
clouds of alto-cumulus type to 25° position angle. Overheads clear,
wind from south at 10 knots, sea from SSW condition one. Visibility
unlimited. Position of YB-54J was 1 miles, bearing 307° Time from
"The Ellyson" lighted beacon.

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:

From behind a huge dark mass of clouds directly above "The Ellyson" lighted
beacon there appeared a brilliant male blue object, shaped like an egg,
moving at incredible speed. This object was observed above the horizon
at 10° to 12° position angle, and remained more or less at that level until
its disappearance into, or behind a huge cloud bank in the NE, directly
above a northbound merchant vessel. During the course of following this
object with the binoculars, the shape could not be made out sharply and
distinctly due to its light penetrating the thin veil of alto-stratus clouds
but, clear enough to indicate the shape of an egg. It is estimated this
length being three times its width, the overall size cannot be estimated
within a certain degree of accuracy, except in relation to the size of the
sun. This the object being clearly seen at 15 miles, would be the equivalent
of the diameter of three suns, this in turn would be subject to a certain
amount of distortion, either plus or minus, depending on atmospheric
conditions due to its light penetrating the veil of alto-stratus clouds.
Since its distance from the YB-54J at 120° port bow, (its closest point of approach) is not known, it can be only estimated
as HUGE. There also appeared four cones of light extending out from the
main body, each at a 90° angle from the other, the upper and lower cones
were equal in length to one times its width (each), the forward and after
cones were equal to one times its length (each). The cones of light were
less brilliant than the main body. This observation was made at the object
made its way through the veil of alto-stratus above the heavy basic clouds
from a point SSW through south to SE in a time element of 6.3 seconds by
stop watch. After its disappearance the course was retraced back to the
point of sighting and continued on bearings in the semicircle trying to
determine where it came from. It is believed that the object came from the
general direction of Key West. No sound could be detected as the object
passed off the windward side (port) of the YB. The windward side being
away from the noises at the YB in said area. The noise of the object
easily detected had there been any, for the object passed relatively close
aboard.

Correction to memorandum concerning "Unidentified Flying Object"

An official of the ONI requested the typed written flying object report to be transformed into a schematic diagram, as near as practicable to the scale of the chart, and to incorporate other information considered pertinent to this phenomenon. The was was noted in this report which at this time was considered by this office to be of little value, but now believed to be important, and it must be pointed out however, that some of the information shown on the chart is purely exaggerated for the sake of simplicity.

Upon transforming this report into a schematic diagram, an error made by the observer was discovered in the typed written report, quickly noted was the bearings 307° true and 247° true were this error occurred, it was then ascertained that these bearings closed together.

1. Position of YTB 541: 4 miles bearing 247° from "The Blob" Lighted Beacon in the Florida Reefs. (Oceans Cove two places).

2. Position of South bound merchant vessel abeam to starboard, 1 mile bearing 307° true (not shown in report).

MEMORANDUM

From: Officer in Charge, Field Intelligence Office, Miami, Florida
To: District Intelligence Officer, SIXTH Naval District

Subj: Unidentified Flying Object

Encl: (1) Memo from observer of Subject Object
       (2) Diagram of sighting, compiled by observer

1. A representative of this office was informed by Chief of Staff, Naval Base, Key West, that a report of a sighting made by H.J. BROWN, CMC, USN, on 29 July 1954 was forwarded to your office on 4 August 1954. Enclosures (1) and (2) are supplemental to that report.

2. BROWN is regarded by the command at Key West as a most reliable Chief Petty Officer. Conversation with BROWN disclosed that he had been in the Navy for twenty-two years. He stated that he has observed meteors, meteorites, comets, etc., in the past, and that they invariably traveled at some angle to the horizon or the earth's surface. He did not believe subject object could possibly have been one of these natural phenomena, as it traveled parallel to the surface of the earth.

3. The helmsman on BROWN's vessel also sighted subject object. His version of the sighting is being compiled and will be forwarded in the near future.

10 August 1954

From: MARTIN, Sidney J., l4l, 62 53, Seaman, U. S. Navy
To: Field Intelligence Officer, Miami, Florida
Subj: Unidentified Flying Object; report of
Time: About 0340R, 29 July 1954
Witnessed by: BROWN, Wilbert James, QMC, USN

General Situation: Aboard the USS YTB-543 with tow enroute from Miami, Florida, to Key West, Florida

1. While in the status of performing my duties (1) as Helmsman on the 0300 to 0600 watch and, (2) Assisting Chief Quartermaster BROWN in obtaining a terrestrial fix to determine the position of the YTB-543 and its tow on a momentous morning, I was in the process of checking the ship's head by the magnetic compass, after such time assisting Chief Quartermaster BROWN in obtaining a fix which was timed at 0335R. Almost within the same moment Chief Quartermaster BROWN was still on the starboard wing of the bridges with stop watch and binoculars in his hands, said, "I feel certain that this beacon off the starboard bow is the elbow but I am going to check it's characteristics for positive identification. I am certain that the lighted buoy on the starboard beam, for I believe the merchant vessel to starboard is in line with the lighted buoy." Then instantly I heard Chief Quartermaster BROWN call to me, saying, "Martin Quickly! Look off the starboard bow and slightly high." There was a sight of an almost unbelievable phenomenon in the southwest moving at incredible speed. Leaving the steering wheel momentarily to catch a better glimpse of the object as it passed off the port side, I followed the object as it passed off the port side until it disappeared in the northeast, almost directly above a north bound merchant vessel, off the port quarter.

2. Description of object: Unaided by any optical instruments, the object appeared to the naked eye as a very large or rather huge object, similar in shape to a U. S. Navy blimp, and of bright white-blue color, moving at an incredible speed, moving faster than any flying object I know of. This object was moving horizontally, slightly above, but parallel to the horizon and disappearing in the northeast, over a north bound merchant vessel, off the port quarter in what appeared to be in a matter of seconds, almost as in relation to say, faster than it would take a man to light a cigarette in a normal amount of time. No sound or noise could be detected as it passed off the side.
