Memorandum
From: BROWN, M. J., LT., USN
To: Office of Naval Research, U.S. Naval Base, Key West, Florida
Subject: Unidentified Flying Object; report of
Date: 0330 - 29 July 1954
Witnessed by: MSGT. JOHN C. HILL, USN
Location: Position of VTB-543: 4 miles, bearing 107° from Conch Airfield Lighted beacon in the Florida Keys. 
General Situation: Aboard USS VTB-543 with tow enroute Miami, Florida, to Key West, Florida.
While making a southward passage on 209° true and 6.5 knots through a choppy sea, 3 miles off of the Florida Keys, on the night of 29 July 1954, the personnel on watch observed a strange luminous object in the sky which appeared to be approximately 30 to 35 miles from their position. The object was observed to be moving along the contour of the Florida Keys in an erratic pattern, and at times it would appear to pause in its flight, then resume at an extremely rapid rate of speed. The personnel on watch immediately alerted the navigational watch, and all hands proceeded to the weather deck to observe the phenomenon. Through the use of binoculars, it was noted that the object was a spherical, luminous white and yellow in color, and was estimating its size to be approximately 3 to 4 feet in diameter. The object remained in view for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, after which it accelerated rapidly toward the east and disappeared from view. This same type object was observed in the same general area several times during the course of the evening.

With occasional lightning in the SE and NW. The cloud formation is the type from which very little rain or cumulig usually fall. This type of cloud formation has been called "dibisilicus" or "cirro-cumulus" type up to 25,000 feet position angle. Overheads clear, wind from north at 10 knots, see formation one visibility unlimited. Position of ZCBR-213 was 14 miles, bearing 3070. Winds from NE.

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
From behind a huge dark mass of clouds directly above "the object" unidentified shaped like an egg moving at incredible speed. This object was observed above the horizon at an estimated altitude of 45,000 feet and its disappearance into, or behind a huge cloud bank in the NW directly above the horizon was observed until its disappearance into, or behind a huge cloud bank in the NW. During the course of following this object, the observed was unusually clear, the shape could not be made out sharply and distinction one to its (indistinct) size could not definite determination. The general size cannot be estimated. Length being three times its width, the overall size cannot be estimated. Relation to the distance of the sun, which the object being close behind, would be the equivalent of certain amount of distortion, either plus or minus, depending on the atmospheric condition at the precise time. Place its distance from the ZCBR-213 position angle about 120 off the port beam. This apparently closed a distance of approximately 1-3/4 miles in less than 20 seconds, which is only estimated as the exact time could not be determined. There also appears to be some distortion around the object, such as a trail or vapors, and luminous corona. This clearly indicates the tremendous speed at which the object was traveling. Comparative to the airborne unit was by far less than that of the object. The object's angles of maneuver were equal to one times its length (each). The cones of light were small brilliant than that of common navigation lights and made its way through the sky with a velocity greater than the heavy basic clouds below it. Its disappearance was observed when it came to a complete stop in a time element of 3-5 seconds by stopwatch. This phenomenon attracted other objects of similar build and its disappearance was observed back to the horizon. To the distance and course was imprinted on the mind of the observer for later reporting. So incredible did this phenomenon appear, no sound could be detected as the object passed away from the noises of the ZCBR-213 which may have blotted them out but they would have been quite audible detected had there been any. For the object passed relatively close aboard.

MEMORANDUM

Concerning a memorandum concerning "Unidentified Flying Objects".

An original of the ONI requested the submission of a report concerning the sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena as reported by Commanders Aero-Space Squadron (VX-4), and Commodore Survey Chart 2125, and the information contained herein was considered by this observer and sighting but now believed to be an erroneous report.

Upon transforming this report, it was determined that the statements made diagram, an error made by quickly jotted down notes to determine how this error occurred and the cause could not be identified.

1. Position of VF 833, 4 miles east-northeast of Perrine, Florida showed two planes in the report.

2. Position of South bound aircraft (shown in report).

(2) Sketch of sighting, compiled by observer

1. A representative of this office was informed by Chief of Staff, Naval Base, Key West, that a report of a sighting by LCDR BOWN, USN, on 29 July 1954, was forwarded to your office on 4 August 1954. Enclosures (1) and (2) are forwarded with this report.

2. BROWN is regarded by the command at Key West as a most reliable Chief Petty Officer, with the observation. He stated that he has observed meteors, meteorites, comets, and the like in the past, and knows them. However, he was convinced at some length to the horizon on the earth's surface. He did not believe subject object could possibly have been one of those terrestrial phenomena, so it may be of interest to the surface of the earth.

3. The helmsman on BROWN's vessel also sighted subject object. His version of the sighting is being compiled and will be forwarded in the near future.

10 August 1954
SUBJECT:	MARTIN, MARTIN J., 644 62 53, Seaman, U. S. Navy
FROM:	Unidentified Flying Object Report of: About 0200, 29 July 1954
WITNESSED BY:	BROWN, Hilbert James, PNC, USN
General Situation:	As the witness was enroute from Miami, FLORIDA, to Key West, FLORIDA, the
witness spotted three unidentified flying objects.
Details:	(1) Observed from 0300 to 0600 watch and (2) assisting Chief Quartermaster BROWN in
the operation of steering the ship. At approximately 0315, the witness observed three
bright lights in the sky ahead of the ship, moving rapidly. These lights were proceeding
head by the magnetic compass. After such time assisting chief quartermaster BROWN in
the operation of the ship, the witness again observed the objects at 0335. At this
time the objects seemed to be stationary and the witness was able to observe them with
the aid of binoculars in his hand. The witness stated he was able to observe the
bright red and ring of the object, with top watch and binoculars. In his
estimation the object was about 30 degrees above the horizon.
Identification: I cannot find the lighted body on the standard lamps for
a positive identification. As described, the object would conform to the lighter:
heavier than air, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, moving rapidly, 
quickly took off the standard was and slightly smaller. The
was circular giving the appearance of a ring around the
object as it passed off to the port side. I followed the object
with the binoculars until it disappeared.
Evaluation of Objects: Unidentified by any optical instruments; the object appeared to the naked
eye as a very large, rather more objects, similar
in shape to a saucer but brighter and/or more illuminated throughout.
Know of: This object was moving horizontally, slightly above, but parallel
to the horizon wards a horizontal course. No sound or noise could
be detected. The objects when in a vertical position seemed to oscillate
slightly about its axis in relation to say, faster than a conventional aircraft.
No smoke, trail, or exhaust was visible. No sound or noise could
be detected as it passed off towards the port side.

SIGHTING OF OBJECT AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

SIGHTING OF OBJECT AT MIAMI, FLORIDA
JULY 8, 1954

The object first appeared in the South East at an altitude estimated to be about 4,000 feet. It was approximately 1 mile in diameter, disc shaped with a large dome on top. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes. The object appeared to be able to remain stationary, to move back and forth and to rise and descend at various speeds. As it moved, it emitted a bluish-white light. No noise or exhaust was observed. At approximately 1:15 AM, the object accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared in a Northeasterly direction.
