The contact lasted approximately 10 minutes and was observed by some 20 Turkish Army officers and men. The object was reported to be a silver, disc-shaped metallic craft, approximately 30 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of 2000 feet above Uzundzhovo Airfield.

The text in the document is as follows:

Air Attache, Turkey
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. References information received on 16 Aug 57 concerning observation of an unidentified flying object at Uzundzhovo, Bulgaria on the night of 6 Aug 57.

2. Description of sighting: 
At approximately 2145 hours on 6 Aug 57, the object was first observed by an Air Force officer who was watching the horizon from his home. The object appeared to be a light which was traveling at a high rate of speed on a horizontal course. The light did not appear to be red, green or white, but rather a bright white light which gradually increased and decreased in intensity. After two minutes of flight, the object appeared to accelerate and make a 90 degree turn, continuing on a new horizontal course. No sound was heard during the object's movement. At this time, the search lights would have been turned off. No motor noise was associated with the movement of the object.

3. During the object's movement, the light was turned off. During the object's movement the same as mentioned, there was no exhaust flame.

4. During one of the flights of the object, it was observed directly going into the field traffic pattern and landed. This was the only time the object was seen or heard flying in the area.

COMMENTS OF PREPARARING OFFICER:
The source stated that he had had a great deal of experience as an aviator and observer. He was unable to offer any explanation for the event described in this report.

In future derbriefings of Bulgarian and Yugoslavian travelers, this subject will be given special attention in an effort to obtain further information which might help explain this incident.

AIR ATTACHE, TURKEY

1. General Background. Between 2000-2030 hours (local) on 21 August 1957, source observed an unidentified flying object over UZUNDZHOVO Airfield, Bulgaria. The object was round, appeared to be approximately 25-30 meters in diameter, and was a reddish-orange color. The object was first observed while source was on duty at the Turkish Army Attache in Warsaw, Poland.

2. Point of Observation. According to the information appearing on page 4 is an overlay to USAF Fligtage Chart (1322) entitled "dated April 1955." The exact location of both the object and the source's observation position, which he observed is indicated as follows:

21 August. Description of Unidentified Object. At approximately 2030 hours on 21 August 1957, source observed the object over UZUNDZHOVO, Bulgaria. He was traveling from SOFIA to BURGAS, Turkey. The weather was clear but the night was very dark. The object appeared suddenly and seemed to hover for approximately three to four minutes. It then appeared to accelerate rapidly and disappeared from view. At the moment it was observed, searchlights which had been sweeping the sky began to converge on the object. However, another object, seemingly unrelated to the first, was also observed near the same area about this time. After the first object disappeared, the searchlights continued to sweep the sky for approximately two minutes and then either disappeared or it is light was extinguished.

(1) The UZUNDZHOVO Airfield would be completely blacked out to the light. The object giving off sufficient light to be seen at this distance or in the vicinity.

(2) Suddenly a light would appear only and slightly to the side of UZUNDZHOVO Airfield. The altitude appearing to be 1000-1500 feet. The light maneuvered for a time and then either disappeared or its intensity was reduced to the point that it could no longer be seen. At the moment of its disappearance, the searchlights converged on the area but the object was no longer visible.

(3) The time of the observation would be at which the source was traveling from SOFIA to BURGAS, Turkey. He estimates his speed at that time was approximately 100-120 kilometers per hour. This would place him at a point on the road near UZUNDZHOVO Airfield at the time of the observation.
