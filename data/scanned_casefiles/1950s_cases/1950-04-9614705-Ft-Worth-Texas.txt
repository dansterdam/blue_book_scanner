FORT WORTH STAR TELEGRAM
Tuesday, April 18, 1950
Evening Edition

[Handwritten markings/stamps that are partially illegible]

FLYING SAUCERS? Ira Maxey of 916 5th Ave., a veteran radar bombardier with 3,800 hours in the air during World War II, took these pictures Sunday of flying objects he thought might be some relation to flying saucers. The half circular objects left vapor trails.

Pictures Offer Proof

Vet Sees Flying Objects in Sky and Photographs Them

A former radar bombardier on a B-34 in the Pacific reported Monday that he saw flying objects in the air late Sunday afternoon in two groups, coming out of the west and traveling northeast, and photographed some of them.

Ira Maxey of 916 5th Ave., a veteran of 3,600 hours of flying in the U. S. Air Force, called his wife at about 5:30 p.m. Sunday and asked her to bring his camera out to him.

Maxey said the camera at intervals caught the objects, which he said definitely were not aircraft of any type which he had never seen before.

"They weren't moving fast and they appeared to be six or seven miles away," he said.

He described the objects as tailless craft and noteless. "Not like a saucer but more like a banana."

Pictures showed that the objects left a vapor trail. "They were moving in and out of a thunderhead. After I saw the first group of three I called to my wife for the camera, and then took pictures of another group of three that appeared," Maxey said.

Maxey is employed at the Worth Food Market at Hemphill and Berry.

UNCLASSIFIED

AF FORM 112-PART 1
(REVISED JUNE 1948)

United States of America

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Investigation of Alleged "Flying Saucers"

LOCATION: Fort Worth, Texas

HEADQUARTERS: Eighth Air Force

DATE OF INFORMATION: 9 - 21 April 1950

REFERENCES: Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 18 April 1950
Letter, SAC J, January 1950, Subject: "Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft"

SUMMARY:
1. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, published 18 April 1950, carried a front page picture captioned "Pictures Offer Proof ... Yet Sees Flying Objects in Sky" and photographs. The accompanying story told how an unidentified aircraft was seen in strange phenomena-shaped flying through a thundercloud and photographed them. The picture and story received nationwide distribution by AP Wirephoto.

2. The report was investigated since it was the first known time that pictures supporting no so flying saucer story had been made public, and - if proven to be genuine - the pictures have definite intelligence value.

3. An interview with Mr. [redacted] revealed many discrepancies between his version of the incident and the story appearing in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. After developing the film, he discovered that crescent-shaped objects, apparently trailing smoke or exhaust, appeared on two of the four pictures taken.

4. A study of the negatives by photo technicians at this headquarters indicates that "objects" are abrasions or smears on the negatives resulting from mishandling during or prior to the developing process.

1. News-type Story:
   a. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, carrying a story titled "Flying Objects in Sky and Photographs Them." (Incl No. 1)

   b. The story told how [partially illegible text]
   sighted "objects" said definitely were some sort of three
   man never seen before.

   c. The photographs admittedly retouched to bring out detail, show three crescent-shaped objects, in echelon formation, two of which apparently trailing exhaust.

2. Reason for Report:
   a. The justification of this picture by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, an occasional different local source, and -- as far as known by this headquarters -- in the first time a photograph purporting to be a "Flying saucer" idea is officially presented.

   b. If analysis by expert photo technicians substantiates the note might be genuine, instead of aberrations or optical intelligence value.

(G) "...sent the camera at infinity
and seven enquiring..."

(G) A Kodak Duffay camera was set
into pictures (here 2 hours 2 min
after scene of incident). Camera
of F.C.C. F was mounted at infinity
with 1/50th of a sec. exposure
and diaphragm of f/6.3. The
film used was Kodak Plus-X Pan
18. They involve a target
at 18 sec.

(7) "...objects were said definitely
more or less different at a type
that now a near 'Flora'..."

(7) The person says that he saw
to his surprise, for the first
aircraft, two flying objects
alongside. For the first time
of flying. He says that he
thought they were only reflected
or light will make the
development.

(8) "...they were moving left and they
were to be six or seven miles away
in descend. The objects as tandem
craft and sinusoidal. Not like a smooth
but more like a banana..."

(8) He describes a moment later
that other two objects in the
same direction were seen. On
the other hand, he was not
sure. He was certain of the
aspect of two objects in
flight from side to side. A
light from side to side. On
course by side. He saw a
lower thing as a banana-like
fellow. He was light on
course. He was not sure if
lost from view into the dark
so static were these.

(J) "...pictures shows that the objects
had a vapor trail..."

(J) More reports confirm the
point. A vapor trail was
directed to the two objects
mentioned. The trail was
seen. The point is interesting
because it is the first time
that such a point is clearly
seen. It is interesting to note
that in a relatively 1/10 of
this vapor trail was seen
ahead of two "objects". It is
interesting to note that in
point of the observer view
the relative movement was
very fast. On this particular
vapor trail and they got to be behind
the object.

5. Study in Interpretation of Negatives and Photographs:

    a. The negative of the picture appearing in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and three other negatives exposed at the same time were obtained on loan from the managing editor of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on 12 April 1953, with a print of it.

    b. The negatives were in one strip when given to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, but had been cut before being obtained by Headquarters Eighth Air Force. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram initially refused to release the film when they received it. The editor attributed the abstraction to "curiosity" when they printed instructions in an effort to prove the picture a hoax.

    c. A thorough study of the negatives revealed that "objects" are positioned in the film in the exact position as the picture elements, or strips. These aberrations can be induced by a slight cringing or rough handling, etc. Lending film into the reel of a film development tank or prior to the fact that these are abrasions or cringe is substantiated by:

    (1) The density of the film where the objects appear will show a relatively even, while objects having a relative motion, when photographed, will show a lack of uniformity when photographed at the same scale size.

    (2) The second photograph (fact no. 3) reveals a similar shaped object between the photographer and trees, with no more than 20 feet away.

6. Other Evidence:
    a. Mrs. (name) claims to have seen the object. No other details available.

    b. Local radar installations report no unusual returns at the time.

    c. Teletype weather sequence is forwarded as Incl 4.

7. Comments of Preparing Officer:

    a. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram is Fort Worth's leading newspaper and has the largest circulation of any newspaper in Texas.

    b. Thorough investigation and research by trained photo technicians of Lowry All Air Force Base indicates that objects shown in Inclosure 1 are not cylindrical, flying, through space, i.e., flying maneuvers, but are the result of markings or cringe in the negatives.

    c. Mr. (name) was apparently nervous throughout the interview and stated while in (city), he was in the vicinity. He also reported he had received strange radiation signals while flying over Hokkaido, Japan, on 7 July 1953, which is still
