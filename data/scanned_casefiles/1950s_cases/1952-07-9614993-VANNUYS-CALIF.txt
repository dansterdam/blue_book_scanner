FROM 147th Pilot Training Wing
Luke AFB, Phoenix, Arizona

REPORT NO.
IR-7-52

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

T/Sgt. Andrew A. Przbeck, AF 15208983, charge of quarters for the 127th Air Police Squadron, was contacted by telephone by Pearl Hambuger of 2307 North 14th Place, Phoenix, Arizona, at about 2215 hours, 1 July 1952. She reported having seen unidentified lights in the sky on frequent occasions.

Investigation by this office produced the following information:

1. Miss [redacted] was interviewed and claims she sighted lights on 30 June, 1 July, and 2 July. They were round, appeared to be about 9 inches in diameter to her eye. They remained stationary, first appearing as a yellow-pinkish hue, building up to "a big aluminum color." No wing, running lights, smoke, flame or other signs of conventional aircraft were visible.

2. The objects were viewed each night at about 2100 hours in the evening for an interval of a half hour to 45 minutes.

3. Observations were visual.

4. Observations were made from subjects home at [redacted] Phoenix, Arizona. Light appeared in an easterly direction on 30 June and 1 July, 1952. It appeared "as high as some new bombers." (Estimated angle of elevation 30°). On 2 July 1952, light appeared much closer and was in a northerly direction.

5. [Redacted] is about 12 years of age and a self-confessed science fiction enthusiast. She alleges that she has made numerous other sightings in the past. She lives at home with her mother and never reported any sightings before. These reported sightings were made the day after her mother left for the east because of family illness.

6. The weather conditions at the time of the sightings were reported as follows: 30 June 1952 - ceiling clear; Visibility 15 + miles; Wind practically calm. 1 July 1952 - ceiling clear; Visibility 15 + miles; Wind light surface, 2 July 1952 - clear; few high cirrus clouds in west; Visibility 15 + miles; Wind practically calm.

7.a. Phoenix weather bureau reports the releasing of weather balloons carrying chemical lights for night observation purposes. Balloons are released about 2015 hours. Estimated final observation of these balloons is as follows: 30 June 1952 - 2500 feet over Roosevelt Road, 1 July 1952 - 2500 feet over Roosevelt Road, 2 July 1952 - over Phoenix to south, altitude not given.

b. Captain Wm R. Brock, AO 763833, of the 127th Pilot Training Group observed a low flying aircraft apparently approaching sky harbor on Tuesday night 1 July 1952 at approximately 2100 hours. Landing lights were on and flying lights were observable. Angle of approach was such that aircraft appeared nearly stationary for 10-15 minutes.

No electrical message forwarded because of low evaluation and information developed.

AF FORM 112-PART II
APPROVED JUNE 1950

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

HEADQUARTERS USAF INTELLIGENCE OFFICE
NORTON, EDWARDS AFB, CALIFORNIA

REPORT NO.
13 - 5-52

PAGE    2   OF   2   PAGES

1. Mr. [redacted], civilian employed as a Registration Officer by the Veterans Administration and presently on ordinary leave of absence, was at the intersection of the Angeles Crest Highway and the Mount Wilson Road (see incl. 1) with his wife and four children (aged 11 to 15 years) at approximately 1940 hours on 1 July 1952.

2. At this time the [redacted] family noted an aircraft, identified by Mr. [redacted] as a B-36 flying at an estimated 50,000 feet. The entire family observed the airplane both with the naked eye and using binoculars.

3. At approximately 1945 Pacific Daylight Saving Time the [redacted] noted a bright object, apparently an evening star, at a point described by the source as being 18 o'clock from the moon and a distance of five diameters of the moon from it. The moon at this time was at a point which appeared to be approximately due South from the position and, angularly, about 45 degrees above the Southern horizon.

4. Mr. [redacted] stated that the object was first believed to be a star but when they attempted to view the object through the binoculars a definitely "fixed" object was visible. All members of the family looked at the object through the binoculars and agreed on its appearance. [redacted] also stated that the object, during the time of this observation, was completely stationary as indicated by the fact that no motion was visible despite the fact that he aligned his line of sight to the object along the hood of his automobile.

5. After viewing the object for approximately ten (10) minutes, the family prepared to depart but their attention was again directed to the object when one of the children saw the object move. [redacted] stated that the object remained stationary until it was "on edge" and then moved vertically upward rapidly and disappeared. [redacted] stated there were no visible vapor trails or indication of method of propulsion and that no sound was heard. No discernible color change was observed, judging the cross section to be convex by the way light was reflected as the disc turned to the vertical position. He stated that the object gave him the impression that there was no source of light and it was barely reflected that same area.

6. Appeared familiar with aircraft and stated that he was a former [redacted]. In conversation with the source, the material was typical of meteorological balloons and was sure that the object was neither a "Sputnik" nor a star.

7. Acting on the assumption that the B-36 he had seen earlier at an altitude of 50,000 feet and that the object was at an equal altitude, [redacted] estimated the size as one-half the wingspan of the B-36.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICE:

1st. [redacted] Hold a convincing story of the incident as reported and invited any person checking that the USAF might care to make. [redacted] from California and exhibited his leave slip from the Veterans Administration. He also made statements regarding an alleged sighting of two discs on April 15th, 1952, by his wife and on an incident occurring after dark on April 10th, 1952, which his two daughters told to him. In mentioning the latter two incidents, Mr. [redacted] referred to a letter allegedly to have been written by his wife. This officer was not impressed. [redacted] by 18th District, Office of Special Investigations, was cancelled when it was learned that no reply could be expected in the future.

On the map itself, I can see various place names including:
- Los Angeles
- Pasadena
- Glendale
- La Canada
- Sierra Madre
- Baldwin Park
- Monrovia
- Alhambra

The map shows topographical details with elevation contour lines and numerous elevation markers ranging from around 1,000 to 6,000 feet. The map appears to cover the greater Los Angeles area and surrounding mountain regions.
