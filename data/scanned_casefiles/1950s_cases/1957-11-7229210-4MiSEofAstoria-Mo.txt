SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED

CONTRARY TO PRESS REPORTS. FROM LIMITED DATA IN OFFICIAL REPORT, REFERENCE TO MESSAGE 600 SENDS WPC 42, COPY YOUR HASRAZZLESBAZS. FOLLOWING CONSIDERED OUR TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS:

1. IMPRESSION THAT ONLY ONE OBJECT OBSERVED APPEARS ABRUPTLY STATIONARY, HOVERS, SHOOTS OFF AT GREAT SPEED.

2. EACH TIME SUCCEEDING TARGET PICKED UP IT WAS IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION INDICATING ERRATIC COURSE AND SOME DISTANCE AWAY.

3. A TIME-DISTANCE PLOT INDICATES ONE TARGET RETURN HAD SLIGHT ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION ALSO, SUGGESTING POWERED AIRCRAFT PROPELLOR TYPE AND JET AIRCRAFT RESPECTIVELY.

4. VISUALLY SIGHTING ONLY 3 SECONDS, BRILLIANT LIKE SMALL MOVING LIGHT, SUGGEST HELICOPTER, AIRCRAFT.

5. AREA IS INCIDENT IS SCENE OF MANY SIGHTINGS AND OPERATIONS OF NAVY AND AIR FORCE. WE CANNOT EXCLUDE THE COUNTHESS POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF AIRCRAFT AND THEIR FLIGHT PLANS.

IT APPEARS TO INVOLVE MANEUVERS AND SPEEDS SUGGESTIVE OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT FOR MOST PART. HOWEVER, THE SPEED, APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TARGETS COULD BE INDICATIONS OF SPURIOUS RETURNS (MAYBE TARGETS).
