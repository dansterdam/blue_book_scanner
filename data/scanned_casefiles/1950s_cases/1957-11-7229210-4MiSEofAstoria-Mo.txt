NICAP WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO CLEVELAND TEXAS TO INVESTIGATE. SIGNIFICANT TO POINT OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THIS ORGANIZATION CONTINUOUSLY IMPLIES USAF NOT QUALIFIED TO INVESTIGATE, OR DO NOT RELEASE THEIR FINDINGS, IT HAS NOT MADE ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING ITS OWN FINDINGS OR CONCLUSIONS. DESIRABLE IF NICAP WOULD MAKE ITS FINDINGS KNOWN FIRST, THEN USAF COULD QUERY HOW ANALYSIS PERFORMED AND CONCLUSIONS DERIVED. IN ALL PROBABILITY NICAP WILL LET USAF MAKE FIRST STATEMENT, THEN WILL MAKE THE USUAL CHARGES.

PART VIII. MAKING CHECK FOR INFORMATION REGARDING ATIC'S ENTRY INTO UFO PROGRAM AND EARLY HISTORY REGARDING DOCUMENTS WHICH BROUGHT THIS ABOUT.

FROM: COM.DR ATIC

CONTRARY TO PRESS REPORTS, FROM LIMITED DATA IN OFFICIAL HEADQUARTERS, FOLLOWING CONSIDERED OUR TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS:

a. IMPRESSION THAT ONLY ONE OBJECT OBSERVED APPEARS ERRONEOUS, FOUR SEPARATE TARGETS INDICATED, 3 ON RADAR, ONE VISUALLY.

b. EACH TIME SUCCEEDING TARGET PICKED UP IT WAS IN ALMOST DIRECT OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM PRECEDING TARGET AND SOME DISTANCE AWAY.

c. A TIME-DISTANCE PLOT INDICATES ONE TARGET RETURN HAD SPEED APPROXIMATELY 250 MPH, ANOTHER 600 MPH, SUGGESTING PROPELLER TYPE AND JET AIRCRAFT RESPECTIVELY.

d. VISUALLY SIGHTING ONLY 3 SECONDS, BRILLIANT LIKE PLANET, MOVING WITH HIGH SPEED, BUT HORIZONTALLY, REPEAT HORIZONTALLY, AGAIN SUGGESTIVE OF AIRCRAFT.

e. AREA OF INCIDENT IS SCENE OF MANY FLIGHTS AND OPERATIONS OF NAVY AND AIR FORCE. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT CHECK THE COUNTLESS POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF AIRCRAFT AND THEIR FLIGHT PLANS.

f. ON BASIS OF ABOVE, MANEUVERS AND SPEEDS SUGGESTIVE OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT FOR MOST PART. HOWEVER, THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TARGETS COULD BE INDICATIVE OF SPURIOUS RETURNS (FALSE TARGETS). IN ANY EVENT, MORE THAN ONE RETURN IS INDICATED, CONTRARY TO EARLY RADAR OBSERVATION.
