1. Forwarded for your information and action deemed necessary.

2. A check with ADC Weather revealed the following information concerning cloud cover and visibility in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting:
a. Scattered clouds (less than 5/10 coverage) at 3,000 feet.
b. Scattered clouds (less than 5/10 coverage) at 10,000 feet. 
c. Broken clouds (more than 5/10 coverage) at 30,000 feet.

3. In the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was possibly caused by searchlights in the San Antonio, Texas area (thirty-five miles southeast of Bandera, Texas). Note that the object appeared to be low and southeast of the observers. The colors, speeds and revolving motion would substantiate this hypothesis.

4. No further action is contemplated by this organization.
