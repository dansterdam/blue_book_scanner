10. On 17 June 1954, this office was advised by Major WENDELL F. MOSELEY, 1059QA, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, that at 2325 hours, EST, 18 June 1954, he sighted an unidentified aerial object from the aircraft pardons ramp, adjacent to the southwest corner of Hangar 300, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. Two (2) airmen were WILSON D. TILLEY, A/3c, AF-12450040, and JIMMIE R. DUNCAN, A/3c, AF-14408280, both of 1850th Air Base Group, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.

The object was first sighted SSW of MOSELEY, at an angle of elevation, and as a bright light moving in a northerly direction. The object moved northward to a position directly west of observers, at an angle of elevation of 30-40 degrees. The object traveled a general northerly course during this movement and appeared to veer right and left at sharp angles while moving. The rate of speed was greater than that of an aircraft. The color of the object was a blue florescence, changing intermittently to white. No discernible features were visible, no sound was heard, and no trail or exhaust was discernible. The light blinked continually and at regular intervals. The object appeared to climb a northward direction after the stop directly west of Patrick AFB. The object appeared to continue to climb and was visible until obscured by cloud coverage at 0015 hours, EST, 17 June 1954. The object appeared to be several times larger than the bright visible star. A full moon was visible in the sky also.

Occasionally, when the light blinked and became brighter, it appeared that the object might be crescent shaped on the lower side. No air traffic was known to be in the area at the time. It was noted that Major MOSELEY is a Senior Pilot and also on duty as Airdrome Officer at the time of the sighting.
