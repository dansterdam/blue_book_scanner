        ATCH CG/1 over ATCH CG/1. Investigation reveals that "flares" observed by 6 personnel at Unalakleet between hours of 1700 Alaska Standard Time and 1800 Alaska Standard Time as follows:

Coverant Church approx 1740     22 Jan     (native) 26 Jan     (native)
                                (native) 26 Jan     All confirm "flares"

22 and 25 Jan.     were orange, about 15 to 20 miles distant, just above horizon at 220 degrees from Unalakleet, and were visible for approx 10 minutes prior to disappearance. CG/1 personnel who conducted investigation consider information not too reliable. CG/1 personnel Unalakleet made no observations of the phenomena.

Aerial reconnaissance to Bering 50 miles from Unalakleet revealed no explanation for the phenomena. It is possible that the phenomena were a result of reflections from the sun beyond the horizon.

SUBJECT: Report of Unconventional Aircraft

ATTN: ACIS

In accordance with USAF File Letter AFOIN-CG-1, Subj: "Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft" dated 6 September 1950, the following information is submitted:

1. Three targets were picked up by Westover Approach Control Radar Scopes approximately 26 miles from Westover, approaching the station on a heading of 240° at an approximately speed of 120 to 150 miles per hour. Approximately 12 miles from the station, one target faded and disappeared. The other two objects appeared to approach Westover and move away again several times on courses of 240° and 600°, without making any apparent turns. The two objects remained approximately the same distance apart (estimated one half mile) during all maneuvers. Each target echoed as large or larger than a B-36 target echo. After several maneuvers back and forth, the targets approached and faded out in the radar scope at approximately five to ten minutes. When the targets next appeared they were moving away from the station on a course of 600, at a very high rate of speed, estimated at 500 to 600 miles per hour, calibrated from approximate time and distance. The targets disappeared from the scope on this course. During the time the targets were on the scope, Westover Approach Control Radar station, located near Manchester, New Hampshire and were informed that a target, believed to be an aircraft, was approaching Westover at an altitude of about 8,000 feet. A check was also made with the Air Traffic Control Center, Boston, Mass., and no aircraft were reported in the area at the time.

2. Initial time of pick-up was 1045 EST, 24 January 1951. Length of observation was estimated at 15 to 20 minutes.

3. The objects were observed by Approach Control Radar personnel of the 1917th AACS Squadron, Westover Air Force Base, Mass.
