AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det #2, 600th AISS, APO 270                                         62-3-53         PAGE    2

1. At approximately 0025 hours on 20 February 1953, a United States Marine Sergeant, John Muciek, on communications watch at the communication tent of the Cho-Do (KC-5265), North Korea, Garrison, observed an object which resembled a falling star travel a straight path at an unknown altitude from the vicinity of KC-5555. This light was indicated by a steady white light resembling a star. As the light reached the vicinity of KC-5555, it stopped abruptly, and now back and forth in that area. The steady white light was replaced by a red light and from then on, at intervals of approximately three (3) seconds, the light flashed alternately red to white.

2. Upon recovering from his surprise, Sgt. Muciek called to United States Marine Corporal Hubert Hicks of the Cho-do (KC-5265), North Korea, Garrison, who was inside the communication tent. Hicks went outside and witnessed the same phenomenon. By this time, the object was no longer moving around in the area. It was stationary in the sky, and the light glowing from it continued to flash from red to white at intervals of three (3) seconds. Approximately one (1) minute after Hicks had joined Muciek, the object departed from the vicinity of KC-5555 on a southwesterly course.

3. Sergeant Muciek phoned his observations into the USMC Command Post.

4. When I was informed of the foregoing, I called Kodak and inquired as to whether they had had any air incident sighting during the period in question. They replied in the negative and informed me that there had been an air-cap in the area during that time.

5. Today, during a conversation between [redacted] and Major Fak, KMC Commander, Major Fak commented on having seen a flying saucer at approximately the same time with approximately the same phenomena as described by the two (2) Marines.

6. Since one (1) of the oddities of the sighted object was that it remained stationary while holding altitude, in addition to showing lights, and the ability to stop abruptly in flight, it did not seem to have been a mistaken sighting of the air-cap which was a propeller driven aircraft. Further, during the sighting, all witnesses testified, there was no sound, as one would expect from a propeller driven aircraft. (See accompanying exhibit)
