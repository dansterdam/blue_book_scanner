Dear Sir:

I am sending you a report on flying saucers. You may not think much about it, but I had a pair of field glasses I could tell you more. Could you clear some intelligence reports on flying saucers, and could you send me some pictures, I might be to identify the saucer I saw. Could you send me your picture and twinning one large enough to fit in my billfold?

Yours truly,
