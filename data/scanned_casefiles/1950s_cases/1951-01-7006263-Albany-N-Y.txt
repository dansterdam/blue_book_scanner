TO:    Commanding Officer

        Rome, New York

1. The following report is submitted in compliance with verbal request from General Smart.

2. At approximately 1930 hours, 30 January 1951, while flying close formation, in F-86 aircraft at 26,000 feet, over Albany, N.Y., [redacted] (Idaho White Flight Leader) and [redacted] (Idaho White #2 flying right wing position) observed, simultaneously, a green flare descending at a steep angle, at their altitude, approximately 100 to 200 yards off their left wing.

a. The flare appeared to be similar to those fired from a "Very Pistol" and seemed to dissipate at about 25,000 feet.

b. No other aircraft were observed in the vicinity at that time.

c. Idaho White Flight was on a heading of approximately 130° at the time of the incident. The geographical coordinates at the time of the observation were approximately 73° 15' west and 42° 36' north.

3. Both the flight leader and the wing man are in complete accord as to the nature of the object as stated above, and it is definitely believed that the sighting was not a result of canopy reflection or other similar night peculiarity occasionally encountered.
