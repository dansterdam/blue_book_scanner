ATS, Andrews AF Base, Washington 25, D.C.

1. The Techord Flight Service Center, Techord AF Base, Washington - report the sighting of an unidentified flying object by a civilian at Hinkle, Oregon (77 miles north-west of Pendleton and 3 miles south of Hermiston). The time of the sighting was 1630 PST, 20 April 1952.

2. No sketch or photograph of the object is available. Other details concerning the object sighted are:

a.  Number   One
b.  Shape    Ball
c.  Size     Not known
d.  Color    Silver flash followed by light green ball
e.  Speed    Not known
f.  Maneuverability  Vertically towards the ground
g.  Heading  Not known
h.  Altitude Not known
i.  Sound    Light brown with brownish trail remaining
j.  Exhaust Trail: visible for some 20 seconds after the object struck the ground.

3. The weather at this time of the sighting, was 25,000 feet overcast; 25 miles visibility; temperature 73°; dew point 45; wind: North Northeast 13 mph.

4. Witness:

    HINKE
    Walla Walla, Washington
    Phone: 1654
    Railroad Engineer

5. Information submitted by witness at 1330 PST, 28 April 1952 to the INSAG (Interstate Air Communications-CAA agency) radio station Walla Walla, Washington and thereafter relayed to McChord Flight Service Center. No reason offered by witness for 5-day delay in reporting the sighting.

6. Witness claimed he saw phenomena from the steps of the Hinkle Hotel, Hinkle, Oregon. First noticed a silver flash, followed by a light green ball descending vertically leaving in its wake a light brown trail. Object struck the ground beyond the second or third ridge about 12 miles south of Hinkle. The brownish trail remained visible for 20 to 30 seconds. Other unidentified witnesses were alleged to have observed the brownish substance after the object struck the ground.

Preparing Officer's Comments:

If part or all of the object sighted struck the ground there is a possibility that the point of impact could be located and examination made of the immediate area to determine whether or not the object was a meteoric body.
