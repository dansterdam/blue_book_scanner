5. Information submitted by witness at 1330 IST, 26 April 1952 to the USAC (Interstate Air Communications-CAA radio station) via Wall Walla, Washington and thereafter relayed to McChord Flight Service Center. No reason offered by witness for 5-day delay in reporting the sighting.

6. Witness claimed to have seen phenomenon from steps of the Hinkle Hotel, Hinkle, Oregon. First noticed a silver flash, followed by a light green ball, seemingly instantly later in its wake. Light brown trail. Object struck the ground beyond visible horizon. Fell 20 to 30 seconds. Other unidentified witnesses were alleged to have observed the brownish substance after the object struck ground.

Preparing Officer's Comments:
If part or all of the object sighted struck the ground there is a possibility that the point of impact could be located and examination made of the immediate area to determine whether or not the object was a meteoric body.
