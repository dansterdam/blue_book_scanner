TO: Director, Ballistics Laboratory, SGCL

Our best estimate of the speed of the "Squaw" was 22 miles per minute.
For approximately half of this one minute during which we were tracking it,
was engaged in its sharp turn. The acceleration in this turn comes out to be
11 or 12 G as well as we can figure it.

Later on that same day (21 September 1950) we received a telephone
call from the Weather Officer at Otis Field (Major Tuttle) inquiring about our
observations. After a brief conversation he asked us to treat the matter as
confidential. As far as we know, no general publicity was concerned. The following
day we had a visit from two men (from the Boston Office of Special Investigations,
I believe) and we described to them what we observed essentially as is described above). We have not reported this observation to any other group up to
this date.

Very truly yours,

COMMENT NO. 1

1. Research Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., was interviewed 2 October 1950 concerning his reported sighting of an unidentified airborne object on 21 September 1950. He has been with Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Research Associate since 1946. [Redacted] also holds the position of Staff Weather Officer with the 67th Fighter Wing, Massachusetts Air National Guard, and has worked with radar since 1943. His rank with the Air National Guard is that of Major and his serial number is [redacted].

2. The following is an extract of a letter written by [redacted] on 27 September 1950 to a Major TUTTLE, Staff Weather Officer, 33rd Fighter Wing, Otis Air Force Base, Mass:

"An exceedingly puzzling event occurred during the 3rd run when the planes were heading northwest at 30,000 feet. (see attached sketch). We picked up another plane (?) in the radar beam traveling about due north on a converging course toward the F 86's. It was moving very rapidly and I told the pilots up with it, its range and direction from them. The echo caught up with, passed, and then crossed the course of the 86's suddenly went into a very tight (for the speed) turn to the right, headed back toward Boston and passed directly over our aircraft. (perhaps want under). The sketch represents as closely as we can remember, the relative positions of the two planes. Two other observers were with me at the time and we have checked over the facts rather closely. The pilots will undoubtedly recall the incident. They said they didn't see anything which is not too surprising considering the speed of the object and the fact that it may have passed several thousand feet above or below them and still looked like coincidence to the radar.

Figuring conservatively, the speed of the object was approximately 1200 mph, and the centrifugal force exerted on the ship during the turn amounted to something more than five g's. It gave an excellent radar echo which could not be mistaken for anything else and in all respects except for the veloci[ty] seemed a normal radar target. It passed out of the beam and while we continued to track our flight, but we focused on it again for a few seconds shortly after and it was rapidly approaching Boston. We went back to the 86's since we hesitated to leave them too long, but now I wish we had taken some accurate velocity measurements when we had the

"chance and taken the risk of losing the flight."

"The whole thing doesn't seem to make sense as you will discover when you reflect a moment about it. It was very evidently an interception of some sort on our flight, but what? The turn was utterly fantastic, I don't think the human frame could absorb it, but if the object was radio controlled, it had no particular business flying on such courses on planes occupied on legitimate business. A few rough calculations coming control, rough angles, etc. only adds to the puzzle that this object must have been entirely unconventional in many and basic respects. Perhaps the thing that bothers me the most is that it gave a very good radar echo, which implies irregular surfaces and comparatively large size, large enough so the pilots might have had a good chance to see it."

"It seems highly probable that I may be poking into something that is none of my business, but on the other hand, it may be something that the Air Force would like to know about if it doesn't already. I wish you would take the matter up with your intelligence officer or C.O. and get their reactions. The whole thing has us going nuts here and we don't know whether to talk about it or keep our mouths shut. Until I hear from you we will do the latter."

"Perhaps we could run another mission for the purpose of luring it out again and this time track it, or at least get your pilots close enough for a look - they'd never catch it I'm sure."

"There are many more little details which I haven't bothered to include concerning this - mostly scope indications and such."

"Please let me hear from you soon."

Regards,

[Signature blacked out]

Reported that he later discussed this matter with TUTTLE by telephone and TUTTLE advised him that the matter was to-be considered confidential and that in all probability someone from Otis Air Force Base would contact him concerning it. To date, he has not been approached by anyone from the 33rd Fighter Wing. Advised further that the information has not been released to the newspapers.

3. [Redacted] advised that the mission referred to in the extract set forth above consisted of two F-86 aircraft flying between Provincetown, Mass. north, to the Isle of Shoals. These aircraft were tracked and guided by SCR 615-B Signal Corps Radar Unit at Elkins. Two associates who were operating at Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. The purpose of this mission was to attempt to establish wind velocity and was done as a personal favor for TUTTLE. The object was sighted at 0952 Eastern Standard Time at an altitude that could only be estimated to be between 26,000 and 30,000 feet, and 1 R Scope] and the 1PPI Scope at approximately 1320 miles per hour. The two F-86's were flying at 30,000 feet, and it could not be determined on the radar screen whether the object was above or below the flight of F-86's.

The object's maneuvers as being a perfect interceptor pass. The attached "Winds Aloft Computation Chart" indicates the course of the object, as outlined in ink. It will be noted that the object was last known to be heading towards the shore line in a direction that would permit it to pass over Salem, Mass. In connection with the "Winds Aloft Computation Chart", the following information was given by LIGDA concerning his observations, as related to this chart:

1. Object first detected at about point A when F-86's were about at A, on converging course and rapidly overtaking F-86's.

2. Object crossed track of F-86's about two miles ahead of them, about at point B.

3. Object continued out to north, then began a turn to right crossing directly over or under F-86's at C and headed in toward Boston.

CERTAIN FEATURES

1. Crossing point at B was 2½ miles ahead of F-86's.
2. Turn of object was to the right.
3. Object did not go over 39 miles (did not cross 40 mile range marker) from MIT.

4. Object passed directly over or under F-86's
(echoes merged on both R and PPI scopes).

5. Object was not a hydrometeor of any sort--gave
steady, solid echo of moderate strength.

UNCERTAIN FACTORS

1. Time between B and C believed to be about one
minute and fifteen seconds (assumed 1 minute).

2. Radius of turn may be somewhat larger or smaller,
but not appreciably.

3. Exact azimuths of points B and C may be ± 10°."

4. [Redacted] advised that he was in touch with the pilots of the F-86 aircraft
by VHF radio during the period the unidentified object appeared on the radar
scope, and was later advised by the pilots that they had not seen the object.
The following information pertains to the F-86 aircraft at approximately the
time the unidentified object was sighted:

5. [Partially redacted text], Brockton, Mass., who is an Analyst at the Weather Radar Project at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dorchester, Mass., an Electronics Technician with the same project, were with [redacted] at the time the object was sighted and could add nothing to the information furnished by radar scopes and could verify [redacted] statements.

6. The names of the pilots flying the mission were not known.

7. [Redacted] advised that he had discussed with TUTTLE the possibility of running a similar mission in the near future in an attempt to gather additional data in the event the unidentified object should reappear. LIGDA regretted very sincerely his failure to use motion picture cameras that may be operated in conjunction with the radar sets.

8. It was apparent to the undersigned that many people at Massachusetts Institute of Technology are familiar with this sighting and, as a result, an account of it may eventually appear in the newspapers.
