[Redacted name]
Dear Sir,

In reply to your letter/minute 25x Nov 1954, I have investigated the movement of an aircraft between 31 Aug and 9 Sep 1954 to confirm its estimate between 9 Jan and 9 Mar 1954.

A Mustang and Harvard were airborne. Local ATC were consulted. It is quite possible that the Mustang was airborne during the historic (20,000 - 50,000 feet) height range at this time.

It is pointed out that an probability exists that the information could not be obtained from the Traffic Control at the time.

I trust that this information may be of some value.

Yours faithfully

KAIAPOI

Dear Mr.

Regarding your inquiry about aircraft movements over the Kaiapoi area on Sunday, the 21st November, I have to advise that on that day there were 16 movements of aircraft in the Christchurch local area. It is possible that any of these flights may have passed over Kaiapoi.

In view of your interest in flying saucer reports as stated, and inferring that you have seen something which leads you to believe that such an object has been in your area, I have to advise that about 3-30 a meteorological balloon was released from the Wardour Station at Church Airport and may have been seen by you.

Yours faithfully,

[Recipient Address]
Mr. [redacted]
Kalapoi, New Zealand

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This will acknowledge receipt of your three letters, dated 25 November, 2 December and 6 December 1954, respectively. The information which you graciously submitted in the form of personal correspondence and New Zealand newspaper accounts of unidentified flying objects, has been recorded and will undoubtedly serve as a valuable supplement to our research material on this subject. For the purposes of completing our records, and with your permission, photostats copies have been made of some of the articles and letters which were forwarded for our review. This data will not be released to any press media and you may be assured it will be held in the strictest confidence by the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

On 23 November 1954, the Air Technical Intelligence Center forwarded the cloud negatives back to you via surface mail, and all of the articles and letters recently submitted by you are returned as inclosures to this correspondence. Also, attached for your convenience is the Ty. 5, A.F. Form Summary of Events and Information Concerning the Unidentified Flying Object Program. We hope you will find it to be of interest.

Concerning your specific inquiry regarding experimental cargo parachute drops, the article refers to poor visibility plus an additional hazard of increased wind velocities. The success of a mission of this type is primarily dependent on weather conditions. Many factors such as wind velocities, size and type of the parachute (which partially determines the rate of descent), weight of the cargo, dropping height, etc., are all dependent on one another and must be considered in the mission planning of a drop. So, it may be readily explained that during experimental missions, such unforeseen circumstances as sudden change in visibility and wind velocities can disrupt a planned drop. A drop conducted under these conditions would be impracticable due to possible damage or loss of the cargo released, which results in a monetary loss as well as wasted manpower.

Dear Sir,

Also for reply on saucy [sic] precedent saucy. I must out first draw your attention to the tremendous force and circular velocity of the cloud formation which whirled around very much faster than expiring winds. That is clearly fixed in my memory.

I am not a scientist and cannot say whether the force which caused the formation was lightning or nuclear transmutation, but I do know all pilots to avoid contact with such formations in

I repeat my statement, in my original letter that while I was watching the whirling formation, I formed the opinion that if an aircraft encountered such a whirlwind it would not survive to tell the tale.

Would it be possible to obtain wind velocity measuring gauges and radio active geiger counter to possibly dropped through stunning clouds of such like cloud formation with the object of discovering whether they have been charged with a force like by lightning or by nuclear transmutation form sun or any other source.

[Headline]
Ord I See a Flying Saucer—or Cigar Over Canterbury?

By a Staff Reporter

WAS there a flying saucer, a flying cigar, or anything similar that hundreds of people throughout the world claim to have seen in the sky over Canterbury yesterday? Reporters are not paid to run hallucinations, and until yesterday I did not believe that such things existed. Since 3.46 p.m. yesterday I have not been so certain.

[Rest of the text is partially obscured, but appears to discuss an unidentified flying object seen over Canterbury, with details about its appearance, movement, and observations from various witnesses. The article suggests the object was not a balloon and describes its cylindrical shape and unusual movement.]

The text is from a newspaper article reporting on a potential UFO sighting over Canterbury, New Zealand, with the reporter expressing uncertainty about what was observed.

Dear Sir,

One week has now passed since I wrote to the commander's office Wgram 112, after telephone conversation in which he promised me a further also assuring me to write to Air Traffic Control Officer, Advanced 127, which I promptly did. I have not received a reply from the Commanding Officer or the Air Traffic Control Officer.

I desire that I was interested in the Flying Saucer report publishing, will wait a few days longer before writing again. So far, I have not told or decided to share what I have learned on Flying Saucer report to your department. I will not do so unless you require me to do so.

My reason being the unwelcome publicity, even to Air Force matters and possibly in New Zealand Air Force, if spread, might amongst personnel. The reason for the delay, in writing to me by the S.O. Wgram and A.T.R.O. Airman is not they are unable.

Accordingly, I am sending herewith, pilots at New Plymouth, N.Z. pilots sighted at sunrise when they were about 5 or more miles distant. The reports were published in the papers and a documentary made of the pilots eye witness account.

However I was unable to obtain a clipping although I looked through old newspapers in library some future will retrieve from files. I have not disclosed and do not intend by correspondence to your departments regarding what was

I have not yet received an acknowledgment of my report, might of possibly I forward herewith a report for copying this no.22.

My comment on the sighting is that it was outside of that time on Sunday 21st 1950, I was having potatoes in my field at Rangora and I heard noises in the vicinity of Canterbury, that is north east of Rangora. This was just in coming New Zealand airway. (I have recommended with the Community Office Wgtn. the need for investigation of usefulness at that time, he states that only four of his concerned his force planes were out on Sunday and promised to reply by letter. The Community Affairs cannot was that I had wood his first six craft and I had to write to the Civil Traffic Control Officer at Harewood first. I suffered to the G.O. that I was interested in flying bases.

The most important thing is that a few minutes after having the aircraft in the north-east, I heard each level aircraft in the south-west. The time of the angles was sufficient to cause me to look back having a telescope and to look in that direction. I attended almost near

not failed to pick up aircraft, as the midlands transformer Australia aeroplanes fly almost due west of Harewood Airport. I thought that the noise of the aircraft was from a Trans Tasman plane all of which I have seen, have had four engines. I have not understood to anyone that I heard a deep toned aircraft in the south west in the direction of the fields Oxford. I have been informed that it was definitely not the Christchurch Wellington plane.

On my position in the potato fields was sixteen to twenty miles north-east of the airforce base was at Carters Island that would account for me hearing the engines.

The reporter was on the road near the airport which is much the same.

I enclose herewith a map of area. I also enclose newspaper photo of eighteen to twenty year old writers short duration training camp. The white canvas tents my have caused a glow to such things through the country would be 50 (fifty) to supply miles from Durkhill.
