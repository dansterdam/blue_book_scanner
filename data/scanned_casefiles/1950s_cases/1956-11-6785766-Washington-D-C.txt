    a. Assistant Director of Plans and Programming.
    b. A telephone conversation with Mrs. [redacted] elicited additional information in regard to UFOBs. After the object disappeared the second time, Mrs [redacted] went back to [redacted] and it is unknown whether it returned or not. The windows of the [redacted] residence are covered with a plastic material which serves as a storm window. It is possible that some light refraction or distortion occurred and was mistakenly identified as an UFOB. Mrs [redacted] did not appear to be seeking any personal notoriety. The reliability of this report is unknown.
