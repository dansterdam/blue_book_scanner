FROM: 30th Air Division (Def) Selfridge AFB, Mich.
PERIOD: 30 July 1951
TO: A-3

1. An unconventional unidentified "object" was observed on the scopes of an AN/CPS-5B radar by observers at the 752d AC&W Squadron, Empire, Mich., between 1142 and 1152, 30 July 1951. Speed of the blip varied from an estimated 5,700 miles an hour to an estimated 28,000 miles an hour. High scattered clouds were reported in the vicinity. Observatories reported no observed meteors or similar activity in the time.

2. Study of the phenomenon by technical representatives indicates that a certain set of electronic and atmospheric conditions probably existed at the time, and that the none presentation was probably caused by interference from another radar station located at Elkhorn, Wisconsin.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

30th Air Division (Defense)                 WTIA 1-51 30 AD
Selfridge AFB, Mich.                                        PAGE 2 OF 3

1. An unconventional unidentified "object" was observed electronically by radar observers at the 75th AEW Squadron, Empire, Mich., between 1148 and 1332, 30 July 51.

2. One officer and four citizen radar operators, with technical experience varying from two to nine months, saw an oblique abnormal blip with conventional tail marks ordinarily by the sweeping off of target signal strength.

3. Speed of the blip varied from an estimated 5,000 miles an hour to an estimated 26,000 miles an hour.

4. Blip was first detected at 11148 on an approximate azimuth of 285° from the station at a distance of approximately 120 statute miles. "Blip was similar to" an amount "Q" miles northeast of Milwaukee at 430 20' N, 870 31' W. It was tracked on a heading of approximately 210 degrees for two minutes and faded 115 miles to the southwest at 420 01' N, 860 50' W. During this interval the speed varied considerably, at 11132 the area of a similar object was detected at 420 30' N, 860 50' W, radar immediately, at 11329 on best available radar at 420 01' N, 890 30' W, fading immediately.

5. The "object" was observed by a radar type AN/CPS-5, successive speed included, as well "at height" indicators to make usable altitude notations.

6. Weather teletype sequence at Chicago at 1,202 was VFR 250 @1 1/2 X 6/44 0 007%.

7. Conversation with University of Michigan Observatory at Ann Arbor, Mich., indicated no unusual meteorite activity.

8. Comments:

a. The tremendous speed of the "object" within the earth's atmosphere tends to rule out the possibility of the object's being a flying device because of atmospheric friction and radiation with the temperature.

b. Absence of observed unusual meteorite activity tends to rule out possibility of a meteor having caused the electronic return.

c. Study of this phenomenon by technical representatives at this headquarters and at 75th AEW Squadron concluded that very probably the occurrence was activated by electronic interference and abnormal radar propagation conditions occurring simultaneously, resulted in reaction by the radar stations at Empire of electronic signals from an object at 420 01' N, 860 50' W, at a distance of 196 statute miles.

Equipment is the same as at Central AF/CPS-5. The technical explanation of this occurrence is as follows:

(1) Because of the azimuth at which the targets were noticed, it would seem most logical to suspect interference between the two sites.

(2) Possible conditions extent to support such interference theory:

(a) Anomalous propagation to an extent where radars could receive the radar transmitter at 210 horn. This is borne out by reports from the west in at 1 bar, and an area near the Preventation Forecast from the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C., 3 Aug 51 JUL 1951.

(b) A transmitter at Elkhorn operating on the same frequency as a receiver at Emire. This is highly possible in two different transmitters and receivers at each site capable of being tuned to same frequencies, and mutual interference is previously on record.

(c) The False Repetition Frequency of the two radar sets at almost the same rate. (Elkhorn slightly faster). This is probably because of identical net with common pulse having each set at the same False Repetition Frequency.

(d) The two antennas rotating at only slightly different turning rates. This is probable because speed of rotation is adjustable at each site. Common period of rotation at approximately six revolutions a minute.

d. The above conditions, if existing, will give a scope presentation as described by the site at Emire.

e. Detailed technical information to support the conclusion drawn above is available at this headquarters if required.
