Set 1/1, Card 2/3                Japan/USSR                 MO #: None                 Rpt #: TR-1836-58

6004th AISS, visited Noboru ITO, Chief of the Aviation Administration Section and Toru SAHARA, Chief of the No. 2 Security Section, MARITIME SAFETY BOARD (MSA) for information on an alleged explosion off the SIBERIAN coast on 19 February 1958.

2. Recently, three unknown luminous sightings were made off the coast of HOKKAIDO by fishermen and reported to MSA. MSA has recorded those incidents but will not investigate the matter further. In each instance the sighting was made at night. There is no report indicating an explosion off the coast of SIBERIA on 19 February 1958.

3. At 1830 hours (JST) on 31 October 1957 fishermen observed a pillar of flame 100 m high, 1500 m west of ENESU ((4463N/141.28E) for approximately 15 minutes. The color changed from red to blue then disappeared.

4. At 2024 hours (JST) on 1 March 1958 fishermen observed a luminous body that disappeared after 10 minutes at an altitude of approximately 2,000 m in the direction of NOTSUTO POINT (4314N/15.525E) on KUNASHIRI ISLAND. The color was not determined. At 2103 hours (JST) on the same day, a luminous body was observed rising gradually for about 20 minutes then disappearing near YAPADNAYA (ONNERUSU) (4325N/15.625E). The color was not certainly identified, but was not red or green.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

5. At approximately 0959 hours (JST) on 19 February 1958 an unknown phenomena believed to have been an explosion, was detected at 4430N/13730E at a US radar site in JAPAN. The phenomena lasted approximately two hours. This office checked with the Meteorological Agency for barometric or seismic data on the premise that an explosion was detonated. It was learned that there were no barometric or seismic changes indicative of an explosion at the above time. Negative information was obtained from the Maritime and Air Staff Offices of the Defense Agency.

6. Officials of the Meteorological Agency stated that any barometric change would be detected at weather stations in JAPAN. The seismic detection of a nuclear explosion at the MATSUSHIRO SEISMOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY is believed to have been instigated from this search. (Refer to 6004th AISS, IR 1885-58 for seismic detection of USSR nuclear explosion.)

                                                                           May 20, 1958
