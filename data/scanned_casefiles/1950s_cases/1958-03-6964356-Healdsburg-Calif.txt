An object shaped like a dipper, 3 ft in diameter appeared, approached, then reversed course, and disappeared. The object was luminous with a glow and moved at a speed of about 300 mph. No noise was heard. After the object made a reversal of course, it disappeared and was not seen again.
11. COMMENTS
No conclusive evidence leading to conclusion can be reached. Case shows indications of a visual illusion or hoax. However, William Doles gave a reasonably good account and apparently was sincere. No other witnesses have come forward and no physical evidence was left. Case is unclassified awaiting further data for evaluation.
