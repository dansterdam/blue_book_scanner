SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List indorsers in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part II.)

"On 22nd August 1952, two sailors and I were seated east along highway US 224 near Akron, Ohio. I then spotted what might be called an unknown flying object approximately twenty (20) miles east of Akron, Ohio, in the vicinity of Atwater Station. While driving along a road, I noticed a few moments, dimly I remember to the sailor sitting next to me, 'that is the queerest, damn crazy-looking thing I've ever seen.' And pointing it out, then another couple moments observation I became convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that this was no airplane and I would so inform the base back in the bank. We got out and continued to make another observation. Each of us was firmly convinced that this certainly was not an airplane or a bird. We were not even trying to make an effort out of our knowledge in its sighting behavior. We did not dismiss its celestial or individual sighting category. We were trying to derive some meaning from the flying saucer category. We not only did the object disappear into the horizon over a skyline of trees and appeared to vanish, but I continued to make my individual observations, checking by watch 'the line of sighting' and its characteristics, trying to determine approximate azimuth, altitude, ground track and other details related to its potential details. I then walked back to Youngstown Air Force Base and contacted his to clarify just what exactly was going on. I then cautioned the two sailors to silence on what they had seen and informed them of its potential classification of secret after which I told them to remember in detail what they had seen to make out an individual report of their own impressions. I took down their names, rank, serial numbers and duty station at which time is confirmed our travel westbound."

[Header details partially cut off]

I. DESCRIPTION:
(a) Shape - Round (Circular Bright)
(b) Size - About one size of a car headlamp turned on film at night with
handlift then seen on film approximately one (1) mile.
(c) Color - Amber orange, much like a street caution light but with a vertical contrast band which seemed to change from normal brilliance, never vanishing, cycle of change was perfectly constant and not rhythmic. Well compared to the harmonies of the positively displaced blue wave.
(d) Number of Objects - One (1)
(e) Speed - Approximately 200 knots plus or minus per hour indicated. Object visible for seven (7) minutes over estimated course
(f) Trail of Exhaust - No trail or exhaust the observer had the impression of a white halo surrounding the object, possibly a mental phase or optical illusion from watching the object over a period of seven (7) minutes.
(g) Altitude - Between 3,000 feet to 5,000 feet (very constant level flight)
(h) Intervals and course - No maneuvers, course varied at 120 degrees
(i) Manner of Disappearance - Object disappeared into horizon over skyline or trees.

There was a 10/10 stratus undercast below aircraft estimated 4000 feet. The object was estimated to be five (5) to ten (10) miles away and was apparently not a conventional aircraft. The object was not shortly found, having a more or less erratic course and was a very brilliant green light. Estimated to be between thirty (30) and sixty (60) degrees and disappeared into the overcast. No further information could be added. The object had no trail or trailing edge. The observers had previous flying experience, state that he has never seen anything like it before and has not been able to find any explanation. No other corroborating data is remembered by the observers; however, it was reported that the object was of an uncommon visual nature.

2. The basic information on the observation was transmitted from the aircraft to KWI at 2214291 August, by the radio operator, S/Sgt Clayton M. Swanson, C-54/5523.

Comments by Preparing Officer:

1. Station KWI is the CIA Station at Honolulu.

INTELLIGENCE (EXCERPT) REPORT
(Confidential Flying Objects Reporting)
AF L 205-5

1. On 4 August 1952 at 1645 local time, two (2) objects were observed in the sky which are below Hickam Village, Honolulu, T.H. observed two (2) objects in 20 sky which are below Hickam Air Force Base.

2. Upon interrogation by the Intelligence Officer of the 1500th Air Base Wing, he stated that he observed two cross colored disc-shaped objects about 6 to 8 inches in diameter hovering over Hickam Air Force Base area in very close formation. The objects were white in color, like a disc or saucer, thin in the center portion and tapering outward to a thin edge. These objects were moving at a speed estimated by the observer of about 400 miles per hour. The objects were observed for a period of about 5 minutes. One of the objects suddenly began to pop upwards in a spinning action and disappeared causing a disturbance of the air as that produced by a heat wave. Briefly speaking, there were no exhaust flames, condensed or other noises emanating from the objects. The outlines appeared to be sharp and the objects had a pale-like appearance.

3. The objects were reported were at an altitude of about 2,000 feet, running in a southwest trend that the objects were at a 30° to 50° angle. The weather was clear, and there was a slight breeze. The observation was made on the same day of the sighting. The time of the sighting. The observer stated that there were at least two planes airborne in the vicinity of the objects. No report of a flying object was made by any flying personnel on that date. Although hundreds of civilians on foot and in automobiles were in the vicinity (the sighting occurred on one of the busiest streets of Honolulu), no other reports were received of the sighting.

COMMENT BY PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The objects were allegedly hovering in an area located between John Rodgers (Honolulu International Airport) and Hickam Air Force Base, an area which would place them over military and civilian aircraft. Neither military nor civilian control towers sighted any strange objects in the area.

2. The observer is a telephone repair man by trade and has been living in the vicinity of Hickam Air Force Base for a period of 10 years. His knowledge of aircraft is quite extensive.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PICOBRPT
Central Illinois

15 August 1952

Wing Intelligence Section, CHANUTE AFB, ILL.

Lt Forrest G. Gentry, Wg Intel Off

At 2300 hours CDT, 15 August 1952, Lt Col [REDACTED] non-rated, not on flying status, Chanute APS, Illinois, was interviewed in the Base Operations Office, Chanute AFB and stated in substance:

Col [REDACTED] his wife and two children were at the Family Drive-In Theater, 2 miles north of [REDACTED] Illinois on the evening of 15 August 1952. At 2132 hrs CDT Col [REDACTED] noticed an especially bright object in the sky to the west of his approximately 270 degrees compass heading. When first observed the object was about 70 to 75 degrees above the horizon. The object moved in a perpendicular line to a point approximately 40 degrees above the horizon, then made an abrupt right angle turn to the north and moved in a horizontal plane to approximately 350 degrees heading. The object was of similar color to the green of a welding torch flame and appeared to be several times larger in diameter than the average star. The object was round without any apparent tail. It remained in sight four (4) or five (5) seconds. There was no sound. The weather was clear with no apparent clouds in the immediate vicinity.

A check at Base Operations, CHANUTE AFB revealed that 2 B-25s were flying locally between CHANUTE AFB and RANTOUL, Illinois during the pertinent period. The crews of the B-25s observed nothing unusual during the evening.
