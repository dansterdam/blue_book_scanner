Organization: 4370 Air Transport Squadron, APO 953
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFOB) REPORT (62-7-20)

1. The above described object was observed by me on 24 June 1952 and reported to Colonel G. H. Lane, Commanding Officer, 4370 ATI Squadron, on 25 June 1952.

2. On basis of information as the observation was transmitted from the aircraft Gunnery Officer, Lt. Colonel S. H. Exner, I am submitting the following report:

Observers: Captain Alfred Craven, Pilot, 4370 ATI Squadron
Lt. Colonel R. H. Exner, Gunnery Officer, 4370 ATI Squadron

3. The object was first observed at approximately 1225 hours on 24 June 1952 while the aircraft was flying at 10,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean, approximately 250 miles northeast of Honolulu, Hawaii.

4. The object, traveling at high speed, was first observed off the right wing tip of the aircraft. It was a long, slender, apparently metallic object, approximately 30 to 40 feet in length, with no visible means of propulsion. The object appeared to be traveling at an estimated speed of 600 to 700 knots.

5. After observing the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

6. Station RTFD is the GCI station at Honolulu.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Air-Parat.? Object
LOCATION: S., S., St., 33 Auaust 1952.
ATAATMENT OF OBSERII:

On the night of 23 august 1952 at approximately 8:15 P.M., military observer was on duty at an Interceptor Air Force Station located in the S., S., S. During a routine air surveillance radar observation, the observer noticed on the radar scope a target moving at a high rate of speed. The observer immediately alerted the radar controller and the two men observed the target for approximately 2 minutes. The target appeared to make a sharp turn and then accelerate to an extremely high speed, disappearing from the radar screen. 

Weather at the time was clear with 25 miles visibility. The observer stated that the object appeared about the size of a car and that no other comments can be made due to the brief observation period.

No further description could be given for a more detailed description in the report.

INTELLIGENCE (SIGHTING) REPORT
(Tentative - Further Details Awaited)
17 JULY 1952

1. On 6 July 1952 at 1645 hours, two (2) objects were observed by Capt. H.W. , F-86 pilot assigned to the 1500th Air Base Wing, and Second Lt. W. L. L. , radar observer, during a radar-visual intercept mission.

2. Upon interrogation by the Intelligence Officer of the 1500th Air Base Wing, the following details were obtained:

a. The objects were sighted by the pilots at an altitude of about 15,000 feet and appeared to be traveling at speeds in excess of 600 knots (about 700 mph). The objects were maneuvering in a spinning, rotating fashion, and at times appeared to stop in mid-air, then dart off at extremely high speeds.  

b. The sighting lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes. The objects were observed to merge at one point, then separate again. Pilots stated that the objects were about the size of a conventional fighter aircraft.

c. It was estimated that the objects were at a distance of about 8 to 10 miles from the intercepting F-86.

d. The pilots reported that the objects were dazzling white in color and showed no exhaust or trail of any kind. The pilots also stated that they could not estimate the actual size of the objects, since their distance from the aircraft was uncertain.

e. It is believed that the objects were about the size of a conventional aircraft.

COMMENT BY PREPARING OFFICER:

This case is being forwarded to higher authority for further analysis and evaluation. The pilots involved are highly reliable and this sighting is considered to be of great significance. No other reports were received from other sources in the area at the time of the sighting.

REPORT NO.:

DATE OF INFORMATION:
13 August 1952
INTELLIGENCE SECTION. CHANUTE Af8, ILL.
B-1

SUMMARY: On 13 August 1952 at 2150 hours, a non-rated Air Force officer and a non-rated civilian observer were interviewed in the Base Operations Office, Chanute AFB and stated in substance:
Theater is 4 miles north of GOODMOTIONS, Illinois, on the evening of 13 August 1952.
The witness, a civilian, and the witness, a non-rated Air Force officer, were driving along U. S. Route 45, approximately 4 miles north of GOODMOTIONS, Illinois, when they first observed the object. The object was first observed at an acute angle of approximately 70 to 75 degrees above the horizon. The object moved in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed, displaying a flashing light near the object. The object appeared to be oval or circular in shape and was estimated to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter. The object proceeded north, stopped abruptly, and appeared to be several times larger. It then proceeded to move in an erratic, zig-zag manner, and appeared to be several times smaller. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes and was last seen moving rapidly to the north.
A check at Base Operations, CHANUTE AFB revealed that 2 B-25 aircraft were flying locally between CHANUTE AFB and BLOOMINGTON, Illinois during the interval when the observation was made. This does not conform to the B-22 described.
