SUMMARY: On 9 July 1952 a report was received by the ACAD Defense Wing. Several unidentified flying objects were sighted by a civilian part-time aircraft observer near Rapid City, South Dakota on 22 July 1952. This report was referred to the USAF Technical Intelligence Operations Section for evaluation and interpretation.
The objects were observed to be traveling at an estimated speed of 1200 mph. The objects were described as aluminum-colored, circular in shape, and their size was estimated to be 40-50 feet in diameter. The objects were seen at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet, and there were a number of them, from 4 to 10 in number. The objects were maneuvering in an apparently random pattern, and were observed in the sky for about 10-15 minutes.

21 July 1952, F-94, 50275, Pilot: Capt Henry S. Anthony, Jr. - (B-2), Radar Observer: 1st Lt. John T. Lawkins (B-2)

At 21:20Z in the Beluga Lake area, 61°55'N and 105°35'W, while at 19,000 feet, a radar contact was made at 18,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished at 12,000 yards and an intercept started. Target was level with the aircraft's speed greater than 100 knots to 6,600 yards. At this point the target disappeared and contact could not be re-established. Pilot did not make visual sighting.

At 22:37Z another attempt was made to contact the target observed earlier. While at 16,000 feet, contact was made at 12,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished and target overtaken at 50-60 knots. At 1500 yards, set action resembled normal break-look and target was lost due to an abrupt upward action as seen in pilot's scope. Contact was re-established at 6,000 yards and followed to 700 yards where target and aircraft's speed were the same - 300 knots. Intercept was continued to 400 yards at which time the target moved out rapidly to 5200 yards where speeds were again approximately the same as the target. Pilot posed the aircraft down and as the speed increased to approximately 400 knots, the target was overtaken to 1500 yards. At this time the radar broke lock due to a rapid downward movement of the target. Contact could not be re-established. Again, no visual sighting was accomplished.

During this incident, the weather was exceptionally clear with practically a cloudless sky.

HIGH SPEED. W WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT
SIGHTED FROM WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT AT APPROXIMATELY 7:59 PM ON JULY 8, 1952 

WHILE PREPARING TO LAND, A FLIGHT CONTROL OFFICER AT WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT SAW SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS MOVING AT HIGH SPEED OVER THE AIRPORT. HE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE TOWER CONTROL OPERATORS AND AN AIR DEFENSE RADAR INSTALLATION AT THE AIRPORT. THE RADAR OPERATORS CONFIRMED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS ON THEIR SCOPES MOVING AT HIGH SPEED. 

THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO CONVERGE ON THE AIRPORT, HOVER, THEN RAPIDLY ACCELERATE AND LEAVE THE AREA. SEVERAL AIRLINE PILOTS IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN ALSO OBSERVED THE OBJECTS.

THE CHIEF OF OPERATIONS AT THE AIRPORT STATED THAT THE SIGHTINGS OCCURRED AT A TIME WHEN THERE WAS VERY LITTLE OTHER AIR TRAFFIC IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

THE SIGHTINGS WERE REPORTED TO THE AIR FORCE AND INVESTIGATED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK.

"As long as I could see it, still there, though the time was low, and it can't be any speed if speed. At most I'll 5 or 10 mins.more should be gone, but it wasn't. No sound or glow or fuming, and just stood there motionless like an aircraft but without lights."
"As the car I stopped to have a good look and then it seems to be just above the tree tops and seemed to move sideways a little. I could see it but it seem to be in a slight haze."
"It is still high up and I could not make out what it was. I don't know what kind of aircraft it might be, don't know of any that stand still that way."
"We are continuing c with the object and had a good view of it." 
"The object seemed to have a pale glow around the edges but no pulsating lights or steady lights, just seemed to glow. It reminded me of a distant aircraft at night, only no lights."
"During 5 or 10 mins. of watching it, it did not seem to move but just stood there motionless."
"After that this, the C.C.S. informed that the object had disappeared and I saw nothing more."

REPORT 1/10 - 7/8/52
Dear Sirs: This report gives the facts as I observed them
the evening of the 7th of July 1952 at Rapid City, South Dakota.
At approximately 8:30 P.M. I observed in the sky over Rapid 
City a bright orange light moving in a northerly direction. It
was at an estimated altitude of about 5,000 feet. The light moved
slowly for about 10 minutes, stopped momentarily, then moved off
again at a high rate of speed in a northwesterly direction.
As the light stopped momentarily, I observed it through field
glasses and noticed that it appeared to be circular in shape and
about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length.
The light itself appeared to be more of a glowing or a luminous
nature than the reflection of the sun as the sky was already dark.
I have been interested in astronomy for a number of years and
have observed many aircraft and unusual phenomena in the sky but
this object was definitely different from anything I have ever
seen before.
I would appreciate your comments and any information you may
have on this incident.
Yours truly,
(Signed)
Rapid City, South Dakota

OCR output:
The report states that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) were observed near Rapid City, South Dakota on July 8, 1952. The report describes the objects as appearing to be metallic and disc-shaped, flying in a straight line and then making a sharp turn. The objects were observed by multiple witnesses for several minutes. The report also mentions that the objects flew at high speeds and performed maneuvers that the observers felt were beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft at the time. No conclusions are drawn in the report about the nature or origin of the observed objects.

This page contains a narrative description of an incident that occurred on the night of August 23rd, 1952. According to the text, a Rapid City, South Dakota resident reported seeing a bright light in the sky that moved rapidly and erratically, eventually disappearing over the horizon. The text provides additional details about the witness's observations and the military's investigation of the incident.

Text in the document:
U.S. Air Force could determine if the object was under intelligent control or not at the time it was observed, because of the apparent maneuverability and speed of the object. It is further stated that at the time, the object appeared to be under intelligent control because of its erratic movements and its apparent response to the actions of the observer. He directs the "tone" of the operator and states the object was doing what he directed it to do.
The witness states that he had the object under observation for about 20 minutes and that the object was first observed about 1:30 a.m. on the date indicated. He states that the object was metallic in appearance and reflected the light from the searchlight which he was playing on it. He describes the size of the object as being about 60 to 100 feet in diameter. He states that the object appeared to be a solid body, reflecting the light, and that he could see no openings or protrusions of any kind. He further states that the object seemed to remain at a fairly constant altitude of from 800 to 1000 feet and that it appeared to be traveling at a speed between 500 and 700 miles per hour.
The above is a summary of the witness's description of the object observed.

MEMORANDUM
From: Capt. Edward J. RUPPELT, USAjK Head, "Operations Analysis Section," Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, OH.

Subj: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a one-like object, which reportedly fell from the air near Hermosa, S.D., on 5 August 1952.

Encl: (1) The subject stone, with small parts broken or carved away. 
(2) Letter of Mr. Everett H. Oloeker, Forester, U.S. Forest Service, dated 2 August 1952, to Capt. Ruppelt.
(3) Collection of photographs of the subject object and of other incidents.

1. As an individual armed service officer who has happened to become involved in the subject discovery, I feel duty of making a report to you (and the U.S. Air Force), for its consideration in the publicized project "Operation Skybook". It is understood that the Air Force is conducting for the armed services the centralized investigation of data regulating to the specialized "flying saucers" and that this official information will be consolidated with officers of the Bureau of Aeronautics.

2. My background of experience that might be pertinent to an evaluation of my competence in this investigation is as follows: Education - U.S. Naval Academy (1940-1944), George Washington University Law School (1947-1949). Experience: 5 years' other, classified intelligence service for the United States; 3 years' other, classified intelligence service for the United States; recently, for about 17 years, specializing mainly in aircraft propulsion, including jet propulsion (nautical assistant, U.S. Naval Inspector, Pacific Northwest, 1942 Consultant, Wright Field Aeronautical Laboratories, and a member of the "Air Materiel Command Rocket Moniter Group" as a Bureau of Aeronautics Representative) as a reserve officer, called to active duty in 1950 (Central Missiles Division, and now Head, Technical Information Branch, Butler).

3. At about the hour 1500 on Friday, 25 July 1952, the air raider, (Captain Vigil, 3d Air Division, Columbus AFB, Mississippi), showed to the air traffic control center at Rapid City, South Dakota, a one-like "flying saucer" which he found by himself and his copilot (who is about 14 years old), during a walk through a small abandoned mine in the Ardmore, Virginia (about 16 years old), during which he recalls having seen the object.

Here is the text from the document:

Subj: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which apparently fell from the air near Washingtion, D. C.

On or about 20 July, 1952, a 60 year-old man and his family arrived at their home near Rapid City, South Dakota. They have lived in or very near the house and small farm he now owns. I have known him for about twenty-two years, and he has worked for me more of the last four or five years. I have found him to be punctual, loyal and honest. 

For the possible baby food container of a mother that recently had been killed in car accident at her home, and that he spoke to me when I took it in my possession, about Wednesday. About 3:30 P. M. from a ground-hog den, he said they had paused to rest, and watched for the ground-hog, when an object fell from the sky and I went to pick it up. He said the object was about the size of a baseball, and that it made a sizzling noise as it fell to the ground, and that he picked it up and that it was very hot. He said he thought it might be a meteorite. I have examined the object and mentioned the newspaper account of the "sky objects" that were reported sighted over the District of Columbia and so far have not concluded that the object in the needless and that he says is not a fused or melted piece of the ground-hog den, and that he thought it might be a meteorite.

After I handed it to me, he said: "Smell the odor". But at the time, two days after its discovery, it could detect no odor. His wife has confirmed to me (and to another witness) his statement that the object had a burned human odor.

I asked and received Mr. Government's permission to have the object examined and submit a report on it without some preliminary investigation.

On 30 July, 1952, after careful examination of the object over the week-end, I have the following description of it in my diary (as very slightly edited):

It is obviously had been, at some time, fractured or two of its five surfaces. The edges of the fractures are very sharp and in places concolor with the rest of the object. One very small part of the fractures looked as though it had been done very recently.

The stone is bluish-gray in color, and I believe is several times heavier than the same volume of ordinary stone. Its longest dimension is about four inches. One surface of it is cylindrical, with the chord of the cylinder about an inch long.

The text reads:

Subj: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which apparently fell from the air near Washington, D. C.

The are certain unusual physical characteristics over three inches, and with a distance of two and five-eighths inches between the arcuate edges of the two roughly parallelipiped shapes found in the cylindrical surface. The cylindrical surface obviously has been intelligently shaped, either by carving or tooling to achieve this highly regular form. There are fragmentary coatings on parts of the surface which appear to have been some type of cement. This cement is unlike or similar to what remains or is so plainly associated with the finger nail fragments of the cement also adhere to both the roughly parallel surfaces. A reddish brown and iron material substance appears very probably to only one (the smallest) of the three fractured surfaces. The small amounts of cement adhering to small parts of the other two fractured surfaces distinctly located along the sharp edges of the fractures. These stains look like residues from a very fluid, thin flow. They seem more connected near one end of the short-cylinder. At this end the three sharp edges of the fractures there are stained on both sides as though the original all three slightly curved edges have entered under stress there.

The middle-sized fractured surface has embedded in its surface what look to be minute bits of a rust-hued accretion. This surface has no trace of any coating.
Also on this surface - as well as on parts of the other two fractured surfaces - granular black or amorphous brown spots or markings that might possibly be contaminates of some kind from its having been perched out of one of the little balls. It was nearly perfectly spherical, and this may indicate a single dent in it, through which it seems to be that gas in cooling might have escaped. The material has these tiny bubbled pits or impressions may have once seen before.

On the afternoon of 29 July, after I had given Dr. a ride to his home, we went with me to the woods where he had found the object. This wooded area was about one half of a mile from the nearest small road. For about an hour and a half we searched for and photographed a cracked tree or rock or another pit of similar material, but found no evidence of anything like the object. However, we did find very near the spot where the object was located two very heavy stones, one larger high, which had semi-dried leaves, obviously still in the process of withering, as though they had been exposed to heat or they could have been dying from the drought.

On 30 July, it took the object in question to the U. S. Bureau of Standards, Mineral Products Laboratory, where an examination was made to determine what it was. According to the report of this examination, Mineral Products Division; Dr. John McBurney, Mineral Products Division; Mr. Frank Caldwell of the Geological Section; Mineral Development Section; Dr. Robert Thullen, geologist. Chief of the Mineral Products Division; and Mr. H. F. McMurdie, Chief Petrologist, did comprehensive examinations. They determined that there was nothing in the object that would allow definitive identification of it.* Most of them said that it was not a natural stone; none said that it was.

Subj: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which apparently fell from the air near Washington, D.C.

1. Dr. McBurney said that he had seen many meteorites and that, in his opinion, the object was not a meteorite.

2. Dr. Insley turned the object over to Mr. McMurrie for an analysis of its chemical composition. It was found that the object might have come from the air, so that they would need to be influenced in their examination.

3. That afternoon I returned, alone, to the area where the object had been found. I spent about an hour and a half searching in a direction that he had traversed, and found nothing during our search on the previous day, covered, about thirty feet from the finding-spot of the object, a smashed and fallen dead grassropper, some 9 inches long, which had broken from the jagged stump, lay on the ground. Apparently, some finding-spot of the object. Its structure was more at right angles and no one side looked as though it had been sheared by a blast object. I have had considerable experience in cutting trees, on and near my Virginia, forested places, and I know that the upper part of a small, dead tree is very frequently fallen. About sixteen feet long, it lay apparently where it had tumbled upon the main branches and twigs, although the main broken parts of the crown are all gone, with the exception of a very small broken limb. The bole of this crown, was very small, slender, and appeared to have been broken off by the falling tree. A small piece appeared to have been broken off quickly, and sharp, and fresh appeared the break.

4. The next day I telephoned the U. S. Forest Service, and talked with a Mr. Everett H. Closter, forester, who has had long experience in forestry and logging operations, including operotions with the Tennessee Lumber Company (the largest in the world) and years in the National Forests of Virginia. I described the situation in detail, and he said that, in his opinion, the object which I had found was not anything unusual, but merely "a piece of a broken tree branch, the result of a windstorm or some other natural cause." He said that such branches do frequently fall to the ground, unnoticed, and that the circumstances which I had described were entirely normal and commonplace.

Subj: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which apparently fell from the air near Washington, D. C.
1. The incident involving this object came to my attention thru an informal, very factual report on the circumstances, forwarded as enclosure of an Office Memo from Mr. Clocker and I discovered that a dead limb about three inches in diameter had been broken off a neighboring (70 feet) pine tree about 25 feet from the crown of the trees. The remainder of this limb was very dry and was lying on the ground about 35 feet from the point of break.
2. It is my conclusion that the fallen tree limb was indeed broken by the impact of this stone-like object, which was broken in two places, with the main break of about 45 degrees, indicating that its entry into the air was at an angle from the horizontal of about 45 degrees. The upper, small-diameter break of this limb, about 15 degrees, seemed to indicate that it was moved only a short distance, and did not fly thru the air.
3. Mr. Clocker writes: "A green maple crown was about 10 feet away in the direction of fall. It appeared undisturbed" (I thought that this was a good condition, a confirming this fact very significant, inasmuch as it tends to break at a right angles about 25 feet above the ground, yet it did not disturn the condition of the leaves and branches that were in its path). This path was undisturbed. I saw this undisturbed green tree and roughly measured its distance from the middle break of the limb to the length of my shoe from this middle break.
16. I do not believe that this down limb was from any fallen tree. Very rotten, I know sassafras wood very well, have seen timber from dead sassafras trees that have stood, dead, for long times, on my Virginia country place. It is very soft, but rots very slowly. The stump was very sound.
17. Another significant detail, noticed by myself and Mr. Clocker, was that the fallen limb was lying on the ground as though it had twisted through a 180 degree arc before or at the time it had fallen. The angles or the break at the ground end indicated this.
18. My conclusions about the fallen tree are that it was very recently hit as a point about 25 feet from the ground, and evidence indicates that some object, apparently the same object that broke the neighboring tree at a point about 42 feet in the air, I surmise that the fallen tree was nearly broken in two by this object, and that it fell at some time, between my first and second visits to the spot, that I would have noticed if it had been down.
19. Over the telephone on 5 August I received an informal report from Mr. H. F. McMurdie, which I immediately wrote as follows:
"The object is not a natural stone. The main body of the object is made up of silica and iron and magnesium and calcium, the quantities of iron and silica being equal."

Sub j: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which apparently fell from the air near Washington, D. C., which were the main things in it.

"The balls - quite small to something like one-eighth of an inch in the old-fashioned cartridges or centerfire 30-30 ammunition - were magnetic, and some were extracted with a magnet.

"The cement coating was principally calcium carbonate. There was not enough quantity in the brown stains for microscopic analysis.

"The general opinion of BOM is the Bureau of Standards who examined the object is that it is not a meteorite.

"It is not radio-active.

"It looked similar to slag."

20. I also have talked with Dr. Alvin Van Winkenburg of the National Bureau of Standards, who made the microscopic analysis of the material. He told me that it appeared to be something that could have been extracted most of them from the old fractured surface with a magnet. In a small bit on one of the surfaces (grounding the cylindrical surface), he said he had found a tiny bit of non-metallic substance, which appears to be silica. This indicates that this material was something that occurred from some time in the past, according to him, judging from the oxidation and other factors indicated in the history of the subject object.

21. At another time, not referred to above, Mr. K. Murdie stated to me, over the telephone, that the cement-like substance was of calcium carbonate and slight sulfilicoates. This material was in solution with distilled water (in determining its specific gravity) about a week ago; and the cement-like substance is still soft.

22. In my opinion, the subject object could have come from either an explosion in the upper atmosphere or from some unidentified source. I have some knowledge that the Civil Aeronautics Authority has stated that the Civil Aeronautics Authority has stated that this type of object has previously been observed over Washington, D. C., but were caused by solid objects. It seems to me to be possible that these objects could have been observed by sensitive observers of light, attention is given to the fact that meteorites are brilliant and leave traces (such as some/for spectroscopically have proven) which is made, according to Wehner's new colligation dictionary, "by directing an meteor".

23. I am convinced that no hoax is involved in this matter. Knowing Mrs. Lanham so long, I completely believes his detailed, and originally written account. Everything he described seems to indicate this was a legitimate discovery which now seems clear to me, that it probably came from the air and passed through the hill and the neighboring trees. I do not believe it is part of the lining of a United States or foreign aircraft.

24. It is suggested that the following steps be included in any further investigation of the subject object:

(a) That representatives of air lines having aircraft that fly the air lines from Washington to Denver, Virginia, be contacted.

(b) That the materials of the object be further and scientifically analyzed by radiologists, including chemists, metallurgists, experts, physicists, and astrophysiclsts.

(c) That the object not be substantially mutilated during the tests, that it be held on film in color showing its condition before any of the tests that might be discovered, and then returned to the same person from whom I received it.

25. The pictures of the subject object in enclosure (3) were made by the U. S. National Bureau of Standards, before any disassembly of the object was undertaken. Any additional pictures of this object by the National Bureau of Standards should be obtained. None of the other pictures, or of those of finding-place of the object, should be published without the permission of the owner of the land where this object was found, as he is not giving his name herein because, understandably, he might be publicicily conscious and object to having his name or the evidence, referred to above, now on his land.

Transcribing the text from the document:

Subject: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which appears to be from the air.

If the Air Force should consider that some publicity of this subject matter would be desirable, it is suggested that the announcement be brief, and it is requested that no more than that be mentioned in the announcement. It is desired that I be designated as the Naval officer on duty in Washington, D.C.

The Navy Bureau of Aeronautics has assigned two officers to conduct this investigation. The consensus of their opinion is that the armed forces should properly be within the province of the Air Force.

This appears to be a scanned document from the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, dated August 4, 1952 and addressed to a "Commander" in Vienna, Virginia.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
FOREST SERVICE
ADDRESS REPLY TO
CHIEF, FOREST SERVICE
AND REFER TO

WASHINGTON

August 4, 1952

Vienna, Virginia

Dear Commander

This refers to your informal request of July 31 for me to look at a fallen tree near your home and to our joint examination of it late on July 31 and again on August 2.

As you explained it to me at this time it was my understanding that no controversy claims of title to property, torts, or events or matters of any kind indicating any legal difficulties were involved.

As you explained it to me a neighbor had found a small rock or piece of material resembling a small or two specific on the recent floor in a wooded tract near his home. The object appeared to be foreign to the general area. A subsequent careful examination gave you to wish to check possibilities that the object could have fallen from aircraft.

Following is a summary of our observations and discussions:

The fallen tree was a dead standing specimen diameter 6 inches in diameter at breast height. Its total height was about 37 feet 9 inches according to our tape measurements of the two sections lying on the ground. The lower break occurred about 4 feet from the ground. This break was apparently over 4 branch stubs under and lying on an area of loose, rotten, and rock and soil accumulation. The upper break or fracture occurred among the branches at the top of the tree stem. It was apparent that in this case the hole had broken from the stump section. The fallen section remained across the protruding stump and gave an unusual appearance with the head of my hand, which it withstood. The fallen section had not shattered when it hit the ground. The tree was comparatively fresh and green, not uncommon and can be caused by a "spike" limb, injury or crowding at some stage of stand development. Such conditions of a hole or holes provide ready entrance for disease organisms which subsequently spread upward and downward, causing structural impairment of the tree and even its death. It is at such points that trees often break.

- page 71 -

Unfortunately, there is no photograph or image present in the scanned document provided. The document appears to be an old UFO report text from Project Blue Book, describing a sighting that occurred on August 2, 1952 in Rapid City, South Dakota.

The text of the document is as follows:

The second break occurred at a point about 21 feet and 9 inches above the ground. It appeared to have occurred much like snapping of a dead, decayed twig. The upper break was almost at right angles to the lower break. The debris had snapped off. On the other half they were compressed inward before breaking, suggestin that the twist had been indicated to some extent before breaking at this point. The tree was about 4 to 5 inches in diameter at this point.

The lower section remaining is standing upright. This section first broke off suddenly at a right angle about 3 feet 6 inches down from the level of the original break. The section hit butt-first slightly beyond the mid-section of the fallen tree. The broken section is held about 5 to 6 inches deep in the soft forest floor and then snapping off at right angles across the fallen bole to lean against a large standing pine. The buttend was still in the hole it apparently made in falling. The crown was largely intact. A small branch was broken off and on July 31, it had fallen by the time we returned on August 2.

The entire bole of the tree and the larger branches in the lower part of the crown showed signs of advanced decay. While the top was relatively green, the middle and lower portions showed indication of the decay. Faint rings, a more or less "case-hardened" shell remained to support the tree. The dry-rotted center fell out as the tree snapped. Only a mere or less "case-hardened" shell remained to support the tree. The brittle, but not decayed.

A few apparently active fruiting bodies of an unidentified fungus are present within five feet on each side of the upper break. They appear as blackish-brown small protrusions in lesions running with the grain. These within about 6 feet of the break showed a heavy, sooty discharge of spores. Those more remote showed lower and more scattered discharges. The blackened areas showed distinct fungus activity. The tree apparently had been dead for sometime, at least 1-1/2 spaces on July 31, but the rain of August 2 obliterated it.

Bark was largely intact except for the lower 10 to 12 feet of the tree. Bark had been stripped by woodpeckers during prior years. This old bark lay at the base of the tree. Apparently decayed by wind and growth, it had fallen from the tree. Those who have worked in western pine types state this to be the practice of the recent full tree around the base of the tree. Such bark-fall often results as the tree is attacked in browsing. The same result can be obtained in "drumming" a dead tree with a hand-tool.

The tree apparently had been dead for sometime, and, like all such trees, had to fall sooner or later. Had it been on an exposed site it would likely have fallen some time ago because of the advanced stage of deterioration at the lower break.

The tree was very well sheltered on all sides and for its full height. The overstory is 70 to 90 feet pine with an occasional Sassfras and oak. A heavy understory stand (dogwood, hickory and maple) ringed the trees. In fact a green hickory crown was more or less interlaced with the crown of this dead tree as it started to fall. A green maple crown was about 10 feet away in the direction the tree fell. The crowns of the tree were not braced or cabled and simply started to lean and twist as the tree fell into the depression in the ground. It fell at an angle and it was possible to see the full scar on the ground. 

The wooded tract is fenced and ungrazed. There was no evidence of animal activity within reach of the tree. No undergrowth discernaged anyone approaching within reach of the tree.

The tree had evidently fallen very recently, perhaps within a week or two. Limb vegetation was freshly pressed down under the bold. There was no chewed or "snapping" limbs to found under trees which have been dead for a longer time.

Examination of other trees within the vicinity showed only one recent breakage. This was a dead B-I/2 inches in diameter which had broken off a live Sassfras tree standing about 16 feet to the east. This tree chose to choose 15 inches in diameter at its broken stem 7-1/2 feet above the ground. At about 42 feet above the ground, a four-foot broken section which appeared formerly to fit the broken end above determined.

I trust this summarizes our findings and discussions had on the site.

Sincerely yours,

1. The enclosed photographs are of an unusual rock formation found in the hills near Rapid City, South Dakota. These formations are well known in the local area and have been the subject of considerable interest and speculation. 
2. The rocks appear to be composed of a hard, heavy, gray material, possibly some type of volcanic rock. They are irregularly shaped with many crevices and protrusions. The formation on the left measures approximately 18 inches in length, while the one on the right is about 12 inches long. 
3. Local residents have suggested that these rocks may have been left behind by retreating glaciers or formed by some other natural geological process. However, their unusual appearance has led to speculation that they may have an extraterrestrial origin. 
4. If you have any additional information or analysis on the nature and origin of these rock formations, we would appreciate receiving it. Please contact this office with any comments or questions.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report describing two pictures or observations of some object. The text describes the objects as having some unusual or unidentified characteristics, such as the "National Bureau of Standards" being involved in the observations. However, the details about the specific objects are redacted or obscured in the image.

A picture of the object which appears to be very small, in the nature of a national bureau of standards star, was made before sunset and a picture of the object which appeared to be substantially larger, made by the national bureau of standards star, was made after sunset.
