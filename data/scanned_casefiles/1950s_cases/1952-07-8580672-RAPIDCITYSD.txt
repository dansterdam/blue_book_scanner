SUBJECT: FLYING SAUPTS

AREA REPORTED ON: United States                                SPECIAL AIR DEPOT GROUP, MATTHEW AFB, N.J.

DATE OF REPORT: 6 AUG 1952     DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 22 JULY 1952     EVALUATION:

PREPARED BY (Officer): Capt. H. King, Operations Officer         SOURCE: Civilian personnel

REFERENCES: (Other reports, etc.) Ltr ATIC/AFOIN-P July 52, FINDEPT

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significant facts in first one or two paragraphs. List informers in lower left. Begin last of report on AF Form 112-Incl 12)

On 22 July 1952 a report was received by the 4700th Defense Wing that several unidentified objects had been sighted on the night of 22 July 1952. This report was forwarded to the 5th Air Force Eastern Defense Command Intelligence Operations Technician, and his complete report is forwarded.

These objects were sighted by the following persons: Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED], Dordentown, New Jersey. Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED], Bordentown, New Jersey. Apparently these objects were sighted by the aforementioned people for a period of an hour and fifteen minutes. Describing at 2245 and ending 2300, the objects appeared several miles west, were travelling at an extremely high altitude, and were round in shape. All of these appeared to be travelling northwest. The disappearance of the objects seemed to be completely by chance that the objects travelled until they would no longer be seen by the human eye. No optical or electrical instruments were used in the detection of these objects. The approximate altitude and course of the movement was at sighting 29 degrees, 50 degrees north, and 75 degrees west. After the fourth disappearance of the objects they were not observed again, either on the night of the 22nd or any succeeding night.

21 July 1952, F-94, 56945, Pilot: Capt Henry S. Anthony, Jr., (-82), Radar Observer: 1st Lt. John F. Markins (B-2)

At 2020 in the Deluge Lake area, 6°29' N 125°37'w, while at 16,000 feet, first contact was made at 16,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished at 12,000 yards and an intercept started. Target was level with the aircraft's speed greater than 100 knots to 6,000 yards; At this point the target disappeared and contact could not be re-established. Pilot did not make visual sighting.

At 2218r another attempt was made to contact the target observed earlier. While at 16,000 feet, contact was made at 12,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished and target was overtaken at 50-60 knots. At 1500 yards, set action resembled normal break-lock and target was lost due to an abrupt upward motion as seen in pilot's scope. Contact was re-established at 6,000 yards and followed to 700 yards where target and aircraft speed appeared the same - 300 knots. Intercept was continued to 400 yards at which time the target sped out rapidly to 3200 yards where speeds were again synchronized with the target moving from. Pilot noted the aircraft then was the speed increased to approximately 400 knots, the target was overtaken to 1500 yards.

At this time the radar broke lock due to a rapid downward movement of the target. Contact could not be re-established. Again, no visual sighting was accomplished.

During this incident, the weather was exceptionally clear with practically a cloudless sky.

1952-

I first heard about it at home. It was about 6:- in the evening when the phone rang and it was out of the Peter Gries.

The tower operator at Lackboard AFB in Columbus, Ohio, & office, chief of base, had spotted "three F-47's, apparently flying in formation over the base. Five F-84's had been scrambled to intercept and they were in the air right now. So far, the tower operator told me the intercept has been maneuvering because the objects were traveling two to three thousand miles an hour and were too fast for the F-84's.

He was monitoring the two radio conversation and he put his telephone near the speaker.

I heard:
"We 20,000 and still above us"

Altitude checked.

"Low on fuel, going home."

"Made it to my car in record time and took off toward Rapid
Patterson, about twelve miles from where I was flying.

It was still light, although the sun was low, and it's dusk.

I kept looking toward the dark "rolling" I noticed in the sky, the
dark press to the ground, and fire just visited the other wing off
another UFO report when I saw them.

They convinced me.

Off to the west of the airbase were dark objects in the sky.

Began to describe to three interested men.

By this time I arrived at base operations that were that of
four down people on the ramp, all looking up.

The (illegible word) Commander was there or they got.

About this time a C-54 transport taxied up and stopped. It
was the Ellsworth Flight from Washington and I said, "People
will get off."

One passenger, an officer from ATC, was to be and landed.

A rain of fire.

Made some pictures of this, I saw the beginning. To
never thought I'd see one.

The next passengers, I conversed with the other officers.

Then, psychologically from the Rand Medical Laboratory, I know
them because they had visited the Rand area, collecting
data for a paper they were writing on UFO.

The title of the paper was to be the psychological aspects
of UFO sightings.

Almost gliding over each other in their course to tell what...

story they told me how they had watched the UFO from the C.S.
Both had seen them "dog fighting" between themselves.

Night before they coming I said.
Mike Hall & me their only contact but on the way they got a
call to look at their track completely that time. Situation
was drawn on the map and sketched is now one of the
documents filed. In the mid. the location was to
focus point of several individuals present at the watch out
came close to the encounter.

Some of the crew were falling down & regular told it
quickly George & me first heard that the position act was the
operation office of the local fire (?) control, the 97th Lighter
Interceptor Squadron.

I ran over to interceptor operations and went in. I knew the
duty officer because several times before on the 97th Interceptor
cleared helicopter over Rapid. Then I told him about the UFO.
I received info. which materialized item. When I told the
man over the base I saw the country of going out & look
at some running back in and hit the portable button. Some
minutes later two F-84s were indeed UFO's. Just soon clear
appeared but their large tail in the light about before or
their presence.

I believe we were in action.
At the same time spirited up. Sure it was no ordinary place
and later only one - they blazed at a different more than one
flight or action on the same (?) visited his mind with it.

Rapid 11/6 Wly/20/c

The vapor trails thinned out and disappeared right under the three UFO's and it was obvious that the big hit was close to. Here were three that didn't escape.

That night the 9th Fighter Interceptor Sqdn. was added that more balloons to their records. The F-84's had been out to chase.

The first sighting photos contained the balloons. They had been sighted together and carried on information picking.

I like been routed. The A.P. predicted to the 3rd cloud.
(name withheld) had been routed. A C-54 (text unclear) at Capistrano Conserv.
(name withheld) had been routed. The other opinion was being routed to be a humored other.

This was an interesting sighting that was sure to discover it. Not all of the observers later agreed that this was what was to be. Sighted was the lower operations announcement of a C-54 that had been routed. Objects had been traveling 2000 or 3000 miles an hour. They were more long gone in the fifteen minutes or it passed this.

Secondly, I found out that the C-54's other sighting had actually passed the balloons sighting Colorado and the other but none of the passengers I could see had stopped yet.

And the decisive was our sights on the balloons. Which were about 16 feet in diameter and 100,000 feet, could be a sighting.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Blue Book started the studies here in July 1947 with really nothing in
the Project Blue Book files or a matter of sighting. It
1947 there had been a total of reports from the Pacific Theater, which
in 1948 there had been a similar outbreak in Korea. It looked
like the Commanding Center in the Midwe Desert of Cit-
tenden in 1949 the sightings centered in the midwest. Some per-
plexed out to be beginning.

When came the climber.

On the night of August 23rd, shortly before midnight, report
of a UFO began to come in from the 142 Radar GOC observa-
post northwest of Cincinnati. Almost simultaneously Air Defense
Command radar picked up a target in that area. A report or the
later the Forestville and Loveland GOC posts, also in Hamilton
County, made sightings. Now, three UFOs, described as brilliant
white spheres, oscillating in a pendulum like motion, etc. on the
the plotting boards - confirmed by radar. All points of sighting
the UFOs was dropped and fixed. 1-8-47 of the Cin. Lt.
National Guard was vectored. They were cut channels 12 radar
and made contact. During it at 20,000 feet at 100% radar
was closed but the UFOs left the area was leading from

It was Charles D. Nugent of the Mt. Rushdie GOC. They had
two lights off to the east. Could Stanfield see it? It
pulled in, extended phone and two outboard. Where, etc. at
that were two large lot flying lights. One of the lights
was a color, green in the other yellow. They were moving north.

This was Stanfield's first reaction but wanted World War II
style had made the long trip up the Pacific with the famous fight.
Air Force and he immediately realized that it was not a fighter
it would have to be very close, because of the large distance
between the lights. And, as a clincher, he found came through
the still night.

He dialed the long distance operator and gave the magic word
"This is Forrest Hill, three west zero eight, second letter in
town calling to the duty sergeant at the Columbus Police Center.

A few more seconds and the sergeant had the story.

Another set was assembled and that Mr. Stanfield was a
radio-telephone hookup to the air force, give the pilot, etc. etc.
Stanfield knew the GOC clearing in last time it was done. Any
clincher he could find was the pilot's comments.

Once again the line tag off.

This was a citizen's effort for the Christmas trip. As good
a job as it was quite and from the view of the all
collected the AF, GOC zero information.

23 - 24 JULY 1952 SIGHTINGS

The document appears to be a list of UFO sightings from 23-24 July 1952, with columns for Location, Observer (with some names redacted), and Sighting (with classifications like BALLOON, UNIDENTIFIED, AIRCRAFT, etc.).

The locations include various cities and military bases across the United States, such as:
- Boston, Massachusetts
- Norfolk, Virginia
- Walnut Creek, California
- Albany, Georgia
- Log Beach, California
- Springfield, Massachusetts
- Altoona, Pennsylvania
- Russell Springs, Kentucky
- Jacksonville, Florida
- Trenton, New Jersey
- McAll AFB, Florida
- Santa Cruz, California
- Moody AFB, Georgia
- South Bend, Indiana
- Travis AFB, California
- Rapid City, Texas
- Hamilton AFB, California

The "Observer" column has most names redacted with black bars.

The "Sighting" column includes classifications such as:
- BALLOON
- UNIDENTIFIED
- INSUFFICIENT DATA
- AIRCRAFT
- Military
- Possibly (ASTRONOMICAL)
- Possibly (ASTRONOMICAL?)

The document appears to be part of a systematic record of UFO sightings from Project Blue Book.

MEMORANDUM

From: Comdr. [redacted] USNR
To: Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, USAF, Head, "Operation Bluebook", Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio

Subj: The discovery and preliminary investigation of stone-like object, which apparently fell from the air near Washington D. C.

Encl: (1) The subject stone, with small parts broken or saved away during the preliminary examination
(2) Letter of Mr. Dwight H. Cleckner, Forest Service, of 2 August 1952 to Comdr.
(3) Collection of photographs of the subject object and of other evidence

1. As an individual armed services officer who has happened to become involved in the subject discovery, I feel the duty of making a report to you (and the U. S. Air Force) for its consideration in the publicized project "Operation Bluebook". I understand that the Air Force is conducting for the armed services a centralized investigation of data pertaining to the so-called "flying saucer" sightings. This report will be shown to my immediate commanding officer and the Personnel Division of the Bureau of Aeronautics.

2. My background of experience that might be pertinent to an evaluation of my investigation and limited conclusions hereof is briefly as follows: [educational and professional background details]

3. At about the hour 1600 on Friday, 25 July 1952, Mr. [redacted] Vienna, Virginia, a neighbor of mine in Fairfax County, showed me the subject stone-like object, as a curiosity. He stated that it was found by himself and his grandson (of Alexandria, Virginia; about 14 years old), during a walk through a small [text cuts off]

*Under separate cover.


- page 62 -

Subj: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which apparently fell from the air near Washington, D.C. nearby wood on Wednesday, 23 July, 1952.

4. Mr. [redacted] is 69 years old and has lived all his life in or very near the house and small farm he now owns. I have known him for about twenty years, and he has worked for me most of the last four or five years. I have found him to be punctual, loyal and honest.

5. Mr. [redacted] said he was walking with [redacted] that Wednesday, looking for possible baby foxes, of a mother that recently had been killed in the neighborhood. I remember that [redacted] was visiting at Mr. [redacted] home. About two miles from his car, said Wednesday. About fifty feet, from a ground-hog's den, Mr. [redacted] said, they had paused to rest, and watch for the ground-hog, when said "[redacted], isn't that a funny-looking stone?" He said the stone that he then saw rested on the pine needles - and was not embedded in the needles and that he now well to it, and pick it up. He said to me it "was not an ordinary stone". He added that it was like a meteorite. I mentioned the newspaper accounts of the last few days of sightings and radar trackings over the Washington area of "flying saucers" or lights. He didn't seem to have followed them in much detail or with much interest. Realizing that the object with the alleged burnt color had been discovered under or almost under the air line from Washington to Herndon, Virginia and on to Maryland and West Virginia, over which a veteran pilot and several CAA radar experts had reported one of the "flying saucer" lights had gone (on the left wing of the pilot's craft), I was very interested in the object.

6. After Mr. [redacted] handed it to me, he said: "Smell the odor". But at that time, two days after its discovery, we could detect no odor. His wife has confirmed to me (and to another witness) his statement that the object had had a burnt odor.

7. I asked and received Mr. [redacted] permission to have the object examined by Government experts. I did not want to go off half-cocked and submit a report on it without some preliminary investigation.

8. On 29 July, 1952, after I had periodically studied the object over the week-end, I logged the following description of it in my diary (as very slightly edited and slightly amplified during the next few days):
• • • It obviously had been, at some time, fractured on two of its five surfaces. The edges of the fractures are very sharp and in places, come to this, sharp points. One very small part of the fractures looked as though it was done very recently.

"The stone is bluish gray in color, and I believe is several times heavier than the same volume of ordinary stone. Its longest dimension is about four four inches. One surface of it is cylindrical, with the chord of

Subj: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which apparently fell from the air near Washington, D. C.

the are of the cylindrical surface being slightly over three inches, and with a distance of two and five-eighths inches between the arcs and edges of two roughly parallel planes that bound the cylindrical surface. The cylindrical surface obviously has been intelligently shaped, either by cementing or tooling - I believe by tooling. These are fragmentary coatings of a cement-like substance on the cylindrical surface (as if to smooth or to embed the slightly irregular-perimeter-cylinder). This cement is unlike Portland cement. It is soft and may be extended with the finger nails. Fragments of the cement also adhere to both the roughly parallel surfaces mentioned above, and, in easily noticeable amounts, to only one (the smallest) of the three fractured surfaces. But there are slight amounts of the cement adhering to small parts of the other two fractured surfaces. The largest of the fractured surfaces has yellowish-brown stains, mainly located along the sharp edges of the fractures. These stains look like from a very hot flame. They are more prominent near one end of the part-cylinder. At this end the three sharp edges of the fractures there are stained on both sides of the edges, as though flame might have entered cracks there.

"The middle-sized fractured surface has embedded in its surface what look to be two small bits of rusted iron. This surface has no brown stains. Also on this surface - as well as on parts of the other two fractured surfaces - there are embedded in the stone-like material a large number of little balls, of sizes varying from one-eighth of an inch in diameter to pin-point size. I scratched out one of the little balls. It was nearly perfectly spherical, and like many others, had a single dent in it, through which, I guess, to have gas as in cooling might have escaped. The material with these balls embedded in it is not like any I have ever seen before."

9. On the afternoon of 29 July, after I had given Mr. [illegible] a ride to his home, he went with me to the woods where he had found the object. This wooded area was about one half of a mile from the nearest small road, fenced in - with a neighbors pasture. For about an hour and a half we searched for a smashed tree or rock or another bit of similar material, but found no evidence of this kind. We did find very near the spot where he found the object, a small-leaved shrub, about two and one-half feet high, which had semi-green leaves, obviously still in the process of withering, as though they had very recently been exposed to heat; or they could have been dying from the drought.

10. On 30 July, I took the object in question to the U. S. Bureau of Standards and then showed it to the following scientists, in the order named: Mr. A. Hockman of the Building Stone Section, Mineral Products Division; Dr. John McBurney, Mineral Products Division; Dr. Frank Caldwell, of the Geochemistry Section, Missile Development Section; Dr. Herbert Insley, geologist, Chief of the Mineral Products Division; and Mr. H. F. McMurdie, Chief, Constitution and Microstructure Section, All these scientists said or indicated, after briefly examining the object, that they could not then identify it. Most of them said that it was not a natural stone; none said it was.

that it was a stone. Mr. Rockman carefully weighed it, and ascertained that its dry weight was 532.91 grams (approximately 1.2 pounds) and that its specific gravity was 3.48. He called my attention to the following passage in Dr. Oliver Bowles book, "The Stone Industries", "the specific gravity of common stones range from 2.2 to 2.8." The object is thus about one-fourth again as heavy per unit of volume as the heaviest of common stones. Mr. Rockman and I measured the radius of the part cylindrical surface, and learned that it was approximately 5.2 inches. If the object had been a building block of a cylinder (or annulus) the diameter of the cylinder (or annulus) thus would have been about 10.4 inches.

11. Dr. McBurney said that he had seen many meteorites and that, in his opinion, the object was not a meteorite.

12. Dr. Insley turned the object over to Mr. McMurdie for an analysis of its chemical content. I suggested to Mr. McMurdie that he not tell his assistants that the object might have come from the air, so that they would not be influenced in their examination.

13. That afternoon I returned, alone, to the area where the object had been found. I spent about an hour and a half searching in a direction that was about 5 inches from the last search. Then, at length, going in the opposite direction, I discovered, about forty feet from the finding-spot of the object, a smashed and fallen dead sassafras from the about 6 inches in diameter, 15 feet, 9 inches long, which had broken from the jagged stump, lay on the ground, pointing, generally, toward the finding-spot of the object. Its fractures were obviously caused by a blunt object. I have had considerable experience in cutting trees, on and near my Virginia, forested place, and I know that the upper part of the trees was not where a woodsman would expect it to fall, if it had naturally fallen. About sixteen feet long, it lay at/with its outside section, turned toward the stump, beyond a right angle with the main section. Its larger, broken end was about 3 feet back toward the stump from the complementary fracture of the main broken part. The upper end of this crown part of the tree was lodged, near the ground, on a limb of a nearby, dying dogwood tree. A small limb appeared to have been broken by the falling tree. Judging by the falling tree, it had still-green but withering leaves. A small, dead limb, broken from the fallen tree, hung precariously suspended from one of the fallen tree's live branches. I left the parts of the tree as I had found them.

14. The next day I telephoned the U. S. Forest Service, and talked with a Mr. Everett R. Cloakes, Forester, who has had long experience in forestry and logging operations, including service with the Weyerhaeuser Lumber Company (the largest in the world) and years in the National Forests of

the West. Mr. Clooker kindly came out with me to examine the tree.

His information, very factual reports on the circumstances, forwarded as enclosure (2), bears out the above facts. Mr. Clooker and I discovered that a dead limb about three inches in diameter had been broken off a neighboring large (70 feet) sassafras (or species-?) tree, about 42 feet from the ground; and very near the crown of the fallen sassafras tree, about 10 feet (as measured) from the 70-foot standing tree, was found a piece of limb about 24 inches long, 5 inches long, which was broken in two places, with the base break of about 45 degrees, looking as though it was the same angle as the break forty-odd feet in the air. The upper, small-diameter break of this 14-inch limb, about 45 degrees, looked as though it had been sheared. It did not fit any broken part of the fallen tree.

15. Mr. Clooker wrote: "A green maple crown was about 10 feet away in the direction of fall. It appeared undisturbed"(I thought that this was a dogwood tree). I consider this fact very significant. Something caused the fallen dead tree to break at right angles about 22 feet above the ground, and its sixteen-feet top to snap back toward the stump of the tree about 64 feet (by measurement), and yet the green tree in its path remained undisturbed. I saw this undisturbed green tree and roughly measured its distance from the middle break of the fallen sassafras; it was less than the length of my shoe from this middle break.

16. I do not think that the inner part of the fallen sassafras tree was very rotten. I know sassafras wood very well, have been timbers from dead sassafras trees that have stood, dead, for long three, on my Virginia country place. It is very soft, but rots very slowly. The stump was resilient.

17. Another significant detail, noticed by myself and Mr. Clooker, was that the main, lower part of the fallen tree was lying on the ground, as though it had twisted through a 180° arc before or at the time it had fallen. The angles of the break at the jagged stump top indicated this.

18. My conclusions about the fallen tree are that it was very recently hit, at a point about 21 feet and 9 inches above the ground, by an object from the air, which object apparently already had sheared off the outer end through a neighboring tree at a point about 42 feet in the air. I surmise that the fallen tree was nearly broken in two by this object, and twisted, and left unsteadily standing, and that at first and second visits to the spot, I believe I would have noticed it the first time, had it been down at that time.

19. Over the telephone on 5 August I received an informal report from Mr. H. F. McMurdie, which I immediately wrote as follows:

"The object is not a natural stone.
"The main part of the object is made up of silica and iron and magnesium and calcium - with about equal quantities of iron and silica

"The balls - quite small to something like one-eighth of an inch - in the old-fractured surfaces- made of glassy material - with some of pure iron - rich in iron and silica. They are magnetic; and some were extracted with a magnet.

"The cement coating was principally calcium carbonate.

"There was not enough quantity in the brown stains for microscopic analysis.

"The general opinion of men in the Bureau of Standards who examined the object is that it is not a meteorite.

"It is not radio-active.

"It looked similar to slag."

20. I also have talked with Mr. Alvin Van Valkenburg of the National Bureau of Standards, who made the microscopic analyses of the material. He stated that most of the small iron balls were magnetic iron, that he had extracted most of them from the old fractured surfaces with a magnet. In a small pit on one of the roughly parallel surfaces (bounding the cylindrical surface), he said he had found a tiny bit of nose-like material. I had found no brown stains (similar to flame stains) on this surface which contains the small pit. The presence of this material seems to indicate only that, at some time in the history, the subject object has been in an environment containing vegetable life.

21. At another time, not referred to above, Mr. Mc Murdie stated to me over the telephone, that the cement-like substance was of calcium carbonate mixed with silicate. This substance apparently is not Portland cement or ordinary lime, for the object was put in water (in determining its specific gravity) about a week ago and the cement-like substance is still soft.

22. In my opinion, the subject object could have come from either an airplane or one of the sighted and radar-tracked lights. I have read in the newspapers that the Civil Aeronautics Authority has stated that the "blips" recently noted by its radar observers were not made by atmospheric or electronic phenomena but were caused by solid objects. It seems to me to be possible that these objects were solid and ringed with lights, or lights. Attention is invited to the fact that limelight is a brilliant white light (such as some observers recently have reported) which is made, according to Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, by directing an

C. oxy-hydrogen flame on a cylinder of lime" ( I have underlined the word cylinder). It may be significant (or may be a coincidence) that this cement-like material is mainly calcium carbonate - in what could have been a 10.4-inch diameter cylinder.

23. I am convinced that no hoax is involved in this matter. Knowing Mr. Lanham so long, I completely believe his detailed, and originally somewhat casual, account of the discovery. I have no evidence as to the origin of the object other than its own nature and the apparent fact, which now seems clear to me, that it probably came from the air and passed and broke the 11mb tree, breaking tree. I do not believe it is part of the lining of a United States or foreign aircraft jet.

24. It is suggested that the following steps be included in any further investigation of the subject object:

(a) That representatives of air lines having aircraft that fly the air line from Washington to Herndon, Virginia, be consulted. If the object came from an airplane this plane would have been flying westward from Washington, as the tree was with the broken limb forty-odd feet high is about east-by-south from the fallen tree which was broken. (The windows of passenger aircraft are at a guess located in slightly different positions.)

(b) That the materials of the object be further and chemically analyzed by scientists, including chemists, steel-slag experts, physicists, and astrophysicists.

(c) That the object not be substantially mutilated during the tests, that it be held on file in your charge for a few months, for possible comparison with other such objects that might be discovered, and then returned to me, so that I may return it to the man from whom I received it.

25. The pictures of the subject object in enclosure (3) were made by the U. S. National Bureau of Standards, before any parts of the object were cut or broken off by the examiners. Any publication of these Bureau of Standards pictures probably would require permission of the Bureau of Standards. None of the other pictures, of the trees or finding-place of the object, should be published without the permission of the owner of the land where the object was found. I am not giving his name herewith, understandably, he wants no publicity or curiosity-seekers on his home estate in Virginia. I orally will give his name and address to any Air Force representative who might desire to see him or the evidence, referred to above, now on his land.

26. If the Air Force should consider that some publicity of this subject matter would be helpful in the solution of the problem, it is suggested that the announcement be brief, and it is requested that my name not be mentioned in it, but that I be identified as "a naval officer on duty in Washington, D. C."

27. I have shown the subject object to several officers of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. The consensus of their opinion seems to be that possible further investigation of it, from the armed services point of view, would properly be within the province of the Air Force.

ADDRESS REPLY TO
CHIEF, FOREST SERVICE
AND REFER TO

WASHINGTON

August 4, 1952

Vienna, Virginia

Dear Commander:

This refers to your informal request of July 31 for me to look at a fallen tree near your home and to on our joint examination of it late on July 31 and again on August 2.

In consenting to look at this tree it was my understanding that no controversy, claims of title to property, torts, or events or matters of any kind bearing any legal significance were involved.

As you explained it to me a neighbor had found a small rock or piece of metal weighing a pound or two resting on the forest floor in a wooded tract near his home. The object appeared to be foreign to the general area. A recently fallen tree nearby caused you to wish to check possibilities that the object could have fallen from aircraft.

Following is a summary of our observations and discussions:

The fallen tree was a dead sassafras slightly over 6 inches in diameter at breast height. Its total height was about 37 feet 9 inches according to our tape measurements of the stump, and the two sections lying on the ground. The lower break occurred about 6 feet from the ground. This break occurred over a longitudinal section of the bole for about 2 feet. Such breaks are known among loggers as "barber chairs", except that in this case the bole had broken free from the stump section. I pushed against the standing stump section and gave it some blows with the heel of my hand, which it withstood. The fallen section had not shattered when it hit the ground. The tree was somewhat flattened, enlarged and crooked through the 2-foot section where it broke. This is not uncommon and can be caused by a "spike limb", injury or crowding at some stage of stand development. Such sections of a bole often provide ready entrance for disease organisms which subsequently spread upward and downward, causing structural impairment of the tree and even its death. It is at such points that trees often break.

2-Commander - 8-4-52

The second break occurred at a point about 21 feet and 9 inches above the ground. It appeared to have occurred much like snapping a dead, boggy twig across one's knee. The break was almost at right angles.

On about half of the cross-section the decayed fibers had snapped off. On the other half they were compressed inward before breaking, suggesting that the tree had jackknifed to some extent before breaking at this point. The tree was about 4 to 5 inches in diameter at this point.

The bole section appeared to have hit the ground first. The crown section hit butt-first slightly beyond the mid-section of the fallen bole, jabbing a hole about 5 to 6 inches deep in the soft forest floor and then sagging off at right angles across the fallen bole to lean against a large standing pine. The butt-end was still in the hole it apparently made in falling. The crown was largely intact. A small branch was broken off and perched precariously on other branches when we first viewed this tree on July 31. It had fallen by the time we returned on August 2.

The entire bole of the tree and the larger branches in the lower part of the crown were in a state of advanced decay. White mycelia were prevalent at the upper break. Ring structure at this point was still evident, but the entire cross-section was softening and moist. Ring structure at the lower break had been largely destroyed by decay. Only a more or less "loose-hardened" shell remained to support the trees. The dry-punky center fell out as the tree snapped. The smaller limbs were brittle, but not decayed.

A few apparently active fruiting bodies of an unidentified fungus are present within five feet on each side of the upper break. They appear as black-domed oval protrusions in lesions running with the grain. Those within about a foot of break showed a heavy, sooty discharge of spores. Those more removed did not show spore discharge. The "black-calling" around the fruiting bodies was visible for at least 15 spaces on July 31, but the rain of August 2 obliterated it.

Bark was largely intact except for the lower 10 to 12 feet of the tree. Bark on the north side of the tree had been stripped by woodpeckers during prior years. This old bark lay at the base of the tree, partially covered by old leaf-fall and green vegetation. There was a recent fall of bark from the lower 10 feet of the tree. All or the recent fall lay around the base of the tree. Such bark-fall often results as the tree is agitated in breaking. The same result can be obtained in "drumming" a dead tree with a hand-tool.

The tree apparently had been dead for sometime, and, like all such trees, had to fall sooner or later. Had it been on an exposed site it would likely have fallen some time ago because of the advanced stage of deterioration at the lower break.

The tree was very well sheltered on all sides and for its full height.
The overstory is 70 to 90 feet pine with an occasional sassafras and
oak. A heavy intermediate stand of dogwood, hickory and maple ringed
the tree. In fact a green hickory crown was more or less interlaced
with the crown of this dead tree as it stood. A green maple crown was
about 10 feet away in the direction of fall. It appeared undisturbed.
The base of the tree was well protected by shrubs, forms and vines,
some prickly. The tree could not have fallen far without hanging up
or breaking below the crown. It fell in the only spot it was possible
to fall and reach the ground.

The wooded tract is fenced and ungrazed. There was no evidence of
animal activity within reach of the trees. Undergrowth discouraged
anyone approaching within reach of the trees.

The tree had evidently fallen very recently, perhaps within a week or
two. Lush vegetation was freshly pressed down under the bole. There
was no characteristic "bedding line as found under trees which have
lain for weeks or longer.

Examination of other trees within the vicinity showed only one recent
breakage. This was a dead 1 1/2 inches in diameter which had
broken off a live sassafras tree standing about 16 feet to the east.
This tree is about 13 inches in diameter at breast height and 70 feet
high. The four-foot stub of the broken limb nuts out from the trunk
at about 42 feet above the ground. A four-foot broken section which
appeared occularly to fit the broken stub was found under the crown of
the fallen dead sassafras in question. It had fallen recently, as
above determined. The outer end of this limb was not found, but some
scattered fragments of dead limb fall were observed among the lower
limbs of nearby trees to the east.

I trust this summarizes our findings and discussions had on the site.

Sincerely yours,
