The image appears to be a heavily degraded document with significant blurring and dark spots making much of the text illegible. Some partially readable text includes:

At the bottom of the page, I can clearly read:
58103
2458

"Witness" is written

Handwritten numbers/markings include:
42
37 JUN 454
4 1 422a

At the bottom there are some alphanumeric codes like:
WFA86 YMA87 TY698 TMA52 JRA627JRA628
CO RJEPNY RJEDW RJEP HQ RJEPNB

Most of the upper portion of the document is too blurry to reliably transcribe. The text is mostly illegible due to poor image quality.
