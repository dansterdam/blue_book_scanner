UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

Pages 2 and 3 contain a report on an unusual light seen in the night sky by two civilian guards at Anniston Ordnance Depot, Bynum, Alabama. This is the second report on such phenomena in the last month. While no reasonable explanation of these objects is known here, it is likely that civilian guards were aware of the first occurrence, and were sensitive to any unexplained lights, etc.

11. Position Title and comments of the preparing officer, including his preliminary analysis: Intelligence Officer, Intel Div, D/O, Hq AC&SC.

It is of note that this is the second UFO report out of Anniston Depot within a month (re UFR-1-58). The power or suggestion here is apparent.

The possibility of a WR freak was suggested to the AWS, but the weather was stated to have been normal.

The manner of movements of the object suggest that the occurrence could have been a 'mirror effect' from some source of reflected lights or, a powerful light reflecting from multilayered clouds and giving both the effect of vertical and circular movements.

No further information is available to this headquarters. It is important to note that the 'apparent size' description of the object may not have been arrived at using the 'arms length' rule of AFR 200-2, and is therefore unreliable. Further, no reliability estimate of the observers is submitted. Info not having been forwarded.

Local area flying would not seem to be a possible explanation for the phenomenon.

Adequate info is also lacking as to the angle of elevation during the appearance and disappearance of the object, and the manner in which it disappeared.

12. Existence of Physical Evidence: None
