AF, FORM 112 - PART II
UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM:  Materiel Intelligence Division, 4410 
MATS, Andrews AF Base, Washington, 
DATE:  25 March 1952   
IR-110-52
PAGE 2 of 4

1. At the time of the first sighting, the GCA team was being utilized by a local commercial airline company for that purpose. At the same time, the traffic controller at the Traffic Controller Section, Climb to 10,000 feet, tried to make a visual sighting and to intercept the target. Upon arrival to its new position, they tried in vain to make a visual sighting and interception; this was impossible due to poor weather conditions that existed at the time.

2. The aircraft was vectored in by the GCA team to the headings of the target, but no visual sighting or contact was made of the target.

3. Reproduced below are extracts of certified statements by the personnel reporting this incident:  
a. Statement of Captain Frank Schreiber, USAF, Base Operations, 1400th Air Base Squadron, MATS, Keflavik Airport, Iceland, Operations Duty Officer.
(1) On March 19, 1952 at 1950 hours, it was reported to me by the GCA Unit that a local C-47 on practice run, at 0715Z M/Sgt Hollis, the GCA Traffic Director, reported to the Keflavik Tower that an unidentified target was observed on his radar scope.

(2) After the tower relayed this information to me, I contacted Reykjavik Operations Center. I noted that other aircraft had been cleared into this area. No other aircraft had been cleared. At 0735Z I requested the GCA Unit to pick up the target. This was indicated up the first time.

b. Statement of Master Sergeant John W. Kelly, AF 1,464,759, 1971st AACS Squadron, MATS, Keflavik Airport, Iceland, GCA Crew Chief on duty.
(1) On 19 March 1952 at approximately 0715Z, I observed an unidentified target inbound on a heading of 159째 and outbound on a heading of 330째. This observation lasted for approximately one (1) minute.  At 0722Z we spotted the target again and it was this time it was homing at 270째 and outbound on a heading of 330째. It was last seen at a distance of 50+. It was last seen approximately 90/130 miles from the center of the airfield.

The report details observations made by a GCA crew chief at the Keflavik Airport in Iceland on 25 February 1952. It describes various radar targets detected and tracked during GCA runs with local based aircraft C-47, 58179. The report provides specifics on the times, positions, and behaviors of the observed radar targets.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Keflavik, Iceland

REFERENCES: TR-110-52
25 March 1952

1. This incident was first reported on CJVIS report DID 13-7020Z, from Base Operations Officer, Keflavik, Iceland, to Air Defense Command, and the Director, Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C., and Chief, USAF, Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. Information from Keflavik Air Force Base.

2. The report mentioned above stated that the estimated altitude of the object sighted was 2,500 feet.

3. The statement of Captain Clyde B. Kiser reveals that the GCA operator, whom he conversed with, reported that the object passed his scope at a speed much faster than F-86s that he had clocked on other occasions.

4. The mention of Capt. John W. Kelly, GCA crew chief, on duty at the time of this incident, indicates that the fact that no altitude information is available on the search system of the AN/APS-10.

5. Certain radar phenomena called ghosts or angels, the mechanics of which are not thoroughly understood, are capable of producing returns which in the majority of cases are indistinguishable from real targets. Ghosts or angels usually are observed to have a fairly consistent speed and track, and are identified as a target as they appear and disappear, rather than observed they should be treated as unidentified aircraft.
