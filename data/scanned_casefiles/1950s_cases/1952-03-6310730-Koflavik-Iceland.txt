1. At the time of the first sighting, the GCA team was being utilized by a 1400th Air Base Group, MATS airview flying a C-47 type aircraft for their training period time. As soon as the additional blip was noted on the GCA radarscope, the Traffic Controller notified the C-47 to break pattern, climb to 10,000 feet, try to make a visual sighting and to intercept the target. Upon arrival to its new altitude, they tried vainly to make a visual sighting and interception, but this was impossible due to poor weather conditions that existed at the time.

2. The aircraft was vectored in by the GCA team to the headings of the target, but no visual sighting or contact was made of the target.

3. Reproduced below are extracts of certified statements by the personnel reporting this incident:

a. Statement of Captain Frank Schreiber, USAF, Base Operations, 1400th Air Base Squadron, MATS, Keflavik Airport, Iceland, Operations Duty Officer:

(1) On 13 March 1952 the Keflavik GCA Unit was working with a local C-47 on practice runs. At 0715Z M/Sgt J. W. Kelly, the GCA Traffic Director, reported to the Keflavik Tower that an unidentified target was observed on his radar scope.

(2) After the tower relayed this information to me, I contacted Reykjavik Oceanic Aero Control. I asked if any other aircraft had been cleared into this area. No other aircraft had been cleared. At 0735Z I arrived at the GCA Unit, M/Sgt Kelly said he picked up the first unidentified target at 0712Z. It was first seen three miles from the center of the airport inbound on a heading of 109° and outbound on a heading of 260°. Its last seen position was five miles from the center of the airport. This observation lasted for approximately one (1) minute. At 0722Z he spotted an unidentified target inbound on a heading of 340° and outbound on a heading of 250°. It was last seen five miles from the center of the airport. This observation lasted for approximately thirty (30) seconds. At 0732Z an unidentified target was seen on the same headings as the 0722Z observations, the time and distance elements were the same also.

At 0745Z we both spotted an unidentified target on the radar scope inbound on a heading of 360° and outbound on a heading of 310°. This observation lasted for approximately thirty (30) seconds. At 0756Z we both spotted an unidentified target inbound on a heading of 210° and outbound on a heading of 270°. It was last seen five (5) miles from the center of the airport and this observation lasted for approximately thirty (30) seconds. At 0907Z we again saw an unidentified target inbound on a heading of 270° and outbound on a heading of 250°. It was last seen two (2) miles from the center of the airport and this observation lasted for approximately fifteen (15) seconds.

Airport, Iceland, conducting GCA runs with local based aircraft C-47, 5879.

(1) At 0712z the undersigned, as a GCA crew chief, observed an unidentified target on an approximate heading of 109° in the vicinity of the Keflavik Airport Radio Range Station.

the tower on this. He reported it several more times as showing up
in his scope, so we kept our eyes open for this unidentified aircraft.
Around 0747 we broke off our practice runs and climbed up to around
3500 feet still keeping our eyes open for this other aircraft. I
went back to the navigator's table to fill out the Form 1. A few minutes later Capt. Hartsch called me to come back up and to listen on
the earphones. Then I placed them on my ears I heard the GCA man or
operator describing the speed that this airplane or whatever it was
had just travelled across his scope. He stated that he had clocked
F-86's on speed runs on radarscope and he knew their speed was over
700 mph, and now, and that this object that had just gone across
his scope was much faster than the 86's he had clocked. Capt. Harsch
and myself then took the C-47 up higher trying to get above the top
layer of clouds to try to see if we could see anything. We climbed as
high as 10,000 ft. but the upper cloud layer was still a few thousand
feet above us, so we levelled off. We flew around at this altitude
for ten to fifteen minutes in the vicinity of the range station but we
observed nothing. We then let down and landed.

Comments of the Preparing Officer:

1. This incident was first reported on CIRVIS report DTG 132040Z, from Base
Operations, Keflavik, Iceland to Air Defense Command, Ent Air Force Base, Colorado;
Secretary of Defense, Washington, D. C. and Hq USAF, Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, with information copy to Iceland Defense Force, Keflavik Airport, Iceland.

2. The report mentioned above stated that the estimated airspeed of the objects was 250 knots and that the estimated altitude of the objects was above 9,000
feet.

3. The statement of Captain Clyde B. Knifer reveals that the GCA operator,
with whom he was in contact, stated that the object crossed his scope at a speed
much faster than F-86s that he had clocked on other occasions.

4. No mention of the altitude or speed of the objects was made in the statement of M/Sgt John W. Kelly, GCA crew chief on duty at the time of this incident.
The absence of information concerning altitude of the objects is probably due to
the fact that no altitude information is available on the search system of the
AM/MPN - 1C.

5. Certain radar phenomena called ghosts or angels, the mechanics of which are
not thoroughly understood, are capable of producing radar returns which in the
majority of cases are indistinguishable from real targets. Ghosts or angels usually
are observed in radar located along a sea coast. One characteristic which readily
identifies a target as a ghost is the terrific speed of travel sometimes observed.
When observed they should be treated as if they were bogy aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Flying Objects Sighted by CGA Radar at Keflavik, Iceland
Intelligence Division, HQ MASS

20 March 1952
Charles J. Fowley, Captain, U3AR

SUMMARY:
Report contains details of a CGA radarscope sighting on 13 March 1952 of unidentified flying objects observed by a CGA team while working a C-47 aircraft on patrol near Keflavik, Iceland.

The first of the eight unidentified objects appeared on the scope at approximately one minute at 0722. The remaining objects appeared on the scope at intervals of approximately 11 minutes. The last objects was observed for approximately 15 seconds at 0802. The interval between the first and last sighting was 57 minutes. Poor weather conditions existed during this period.

A USAF C-47 was airborne in this vicinity of Keflavik while the objects appeared on the scope. The pilot of this aircraft was instructed to take a pattern and make a visual sighting of the objects. His attempts to intercept the objects were unsuccessful.

The statements prepared by the USAF personnel participating in the attempt to identify the objects are contained in the detailed report on the following pages.
