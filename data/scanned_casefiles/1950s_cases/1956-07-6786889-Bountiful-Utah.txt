The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it shows a Project 10073 record card from the Blue Book project, which appears to be a document detailing a UFO sighting report.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 7-13-56
2. LOCATION: BOUNTIFUL, UTAH
3. CASE# 6786889
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: 2-3 Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: NONE
6. SOURCE: C. OBSERVER
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 MINUTES
8. WEATHER: Clear
9. COURSE: Unknown
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: the observer, a 60-year-old man, discovered an unidentified object in the sky near the head of a key in color. The object left the observer's position at a very high rate and disappeared from sight. The duration of the sighting was approximately 15 minutes. Observer was apparently not particularly excited by the incident and felt it unlikely that an unusual "aircraft" had been observed.
11. COMMENTS: The observer did not see the object move, but based on the time period of observation, would find it unlikely that an object other than an aircraft would have been seen. The observer possibly saw a weather phenomenon or a mirage under certain atmospheric conditions.
