PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

DATE: 7 July 1956

LOCATION: Bountiful, Utah

TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

SOURCE: Civilian (GOC)

GMT: 07/1330Z

PHOTOS: Yes (XC)

LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: one minutes

NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

COURSE: Stationary

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: One object, shape undefined, the size of the head of a pin held at arms length, metallic gray in color, seen at 40-45 degrees elevation at azimuth of 10-15 degrees. Observer wore polaroid sunglasses.

CONCLUSIONS: 
- Was Balloon: Not checked
- Was Aircraft: Not checked
- Was Astronomical: Not checked
- Other: Insufficient Data for Evaluation, Unknown

COMMENTS: The observer did not see the same object in the same position for a period of seven hours (although he observed it actually only one minute). It is highly unlikely that an object, be it balloon or star, would remain stationary over that period. The observer possibly saw a balloon at the initial sighting.
