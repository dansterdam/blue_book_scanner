[Rest of the text appears to be a detailed report about an aircraft sighting, with details about location, time, cloud conditions, and object description. However, some parts of the text are partially illegible due to the scan quality. The document appears to be from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force systematic study of unidentified flying objects.]

Key details I can clearly read include:
- Location appears to be Prestwick, Scotland
- Date and time are mentioned
- Describes sky conditions and an aircraft observation
- Discusses an object's appearance, movement, and estimated position/altitude

Would you like me to transcribe the specific details I can confidently read?
