11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Numerous unidentified lights that exhibited a powerful yellowish glow observed flying and hovering over San Antonio, Texas. Observed only 3 or 4 miles from watch at the time. Lights flew somewhat erratically and circled in an orbit. Peculiar formation.

COMMENTS: CO at Randolph AFB stated that no A/C were airborne in the area. Since the lights were observed 2 hours, it is believed that a light source, reflections, possibly searchlights. IM data not obtained and an effort to locate searchlight not indicated sighting similar to reports of searchlight activity.

In compliance with AF Letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) Object was elliptical-shaped and appeared to be equal to the size of a 4" x 9½" envelope held at arms length. Only one object was observed. No aerodynamic features noted, no trail or exhaust nor propulsion system noted. Object appeared to be suspended in the sky and remained motionless throughout the sighting. No sound was heard. Object disappeared quickly much in the same manner as would a light, being extinguished. Observed stated the object was quite similar to a cloud or smoke through which a light was shining.

(2) Object was observed 1945 hours, CST, 16 June 1953 for approximately five minutes.

(3) A visual ground observation through 7x50 power binoculars was made.

(4) Observer was at his place of duty, the control tower at Kelly AFB, Texas, at the time of the sighting. Object was in the WNW sky at an estimated altitude of between ten thousand feet and at a distance of between ten to fifteen miles from the observer.

(5) Object observed by A/1C Robert C. Sherwood, AF 16382011; A/2C Albert R. Kostal, AF 27710756; and A/1C William J. Habern, AF 15294235, all from the 1923rd AMCS Sq, Kelly AFB, Texas. Reliability of observers unknown.

(6) Fair weather prevailed at the time of the sighting. Visibility was fifteen miles. Wind at ten thousand feet from SE at 10 miles per hour; wind at twelve thousand feet SE at 10 miles per hour; scattered cumulus clouds at six thousand feet reported.

(7) Observers stated belief that due to the physical make up of this object that the sighting could be explained as the reflection of the sun on a high cirrus cloud.

(8) There is no physical evidence of the sighting.

STATEMENT

At approximately 1945 hours, 16 June 1953, I was on duty as a control tower operator, at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. The sun had just set and I was scanning the sky, keeping track of air traffic in the area, when I noticed an elliptical-shaped light that appeared to be suspended in the NW sky. At first sight, I thought this light might possibly be an unidentified flying object, then I reasoned that it may have been the sun drawing water. This object gave the appearance of a light shining on a cloud or smoke. It appeared to be approximately the size of a regular envelope hold at arms length. I observed this light through binoculars but could not see any additional detail. I notified the AC&W Squadron at Lackland AF Base but they reported nothing on their scopes. ARTC Center, San Antonio was also notified with the same results. After watching the light for approximately five minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I am firmly convinced that the light was caused by the reflection of the sun on a light cirrus cloud.

I certify that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:

STATEMENT

At approximately 10:20 PM on 2 June 1953, I was out in the back yard hanging clothes on the line. At the time I was facing southeast. When placing a pin in the clothes, I happened to look up and saw a streak of light. At first I believed it to be a so called, falling star, but the unidentified object was continuing to move at what seemed to be an extremely high altitude and also another similar object was following behind it at some distance. I could hear no sound from the objects and they seemed to be going at a terrific speed. Immediately I called my husband and we went to the front yard. I showed him the direction they were going and he picked up into view the same thing I did.

As for the description of the objects and other pertinent information, I agree substantially with the facts stated by my husband.

STATEMENT

About 10:20 PM on the night of June 2, 1953, my wife called me from the house to identify some objects in the sky.

When I located the objects in the sky, there were two objects and seemed to be at a very high altitude, changing speeds at will, and moving in all directions. The objects, as I saw them, were yellow in color and were round. However, all I could see was the yellow color taking the shape of some round object.

There were three objects in the air at one time traveling in different directions, i.e., circling, flying directly over head, and zig-zaging motion. The total number of objects seen was six but there is a chance the three in the air at one time returned.

I called our next door neighbor, Capt. [redacted], US Army (MSC), to get his opinion on the lighted objects. My wife, Capt. [redacted], and myself were unable to identify the objects so I called Kelly AB Base and informed the Air Police Officer of the Day that such objects were in the air. After watching these objects for about an hour I again called the OD of the Air Police at Kelly for some information on these objects and he stated that he had informed security at Kelly of my sighting.

A few moments later I called Randolph Air Force Base and was connected with the Officer of the Day and informed him of the objects. He returned my call and stated that the objects were being sighted by him at Randolph and that he was taking immediate action to find out exactly what they were. He stated that the objects very definitely were not planes.

During the two hours that I watched the movement of the objects I called Lackland Air Craft And Warning Unit and reported to the officer in charge of what was being seen by myself, wife, and Capt. [redacted]. The attitude of the officer in charge was certainly not one of very much concern over my report and his whole conversation and manner was one of extreme unimportance to such a report coming from a fellow air force officer. I would think that an officer in such an important position would be more alert to such reports than was exhibited by this officer.

The objects were seen for at least two hours and the last two or the objects were in formation moving in the direction toward Randolph Air Force Base. It was about 12:30 AM, June 3, 1953 when I last sighted the objects and I was getting

Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson,

Now that Jennie has her preliminary clearance, she can help me handle the reports and can type the letters to your successor. This will improve the quality of the typing (1) I am sure. I cannot guarantee spelling. (Neither can I.)

With respect to the two wires you sent us on June 23, there is only one thing to say: The 21 June Reportell AFB case must be tossed out because of grossly insufficient data. So now there is a glimmer of anything interesting there which would justify sending a Form A7 it seems to me that reports of this kind just clutter up the wires without accomplishing anything.

The San Antonio 16 June is clearly a meteorological phenomenon and one that would warm the heart of "anyone." This was undoubtedly as suggested, namely the light of the setting sun on a high cloud.

Referring to the follow-up statement on the 10 June Detroit case, both Jennie and I still think this was a landing light and agree it could not have been a meteor.

Business is a little slow. Jen is going ahead with requesting cooperation from the air control tower operators. Her usefulness has increased in view of her temporary clearance and I hope that her full clearance will not be too long in coming.

I hope we can see you soon and wish you a bon voyage into law school.

Sincerely,
Allen Hynek

UNCLASSIFIED                San Antonio, Texas

Description
Several airmen in the control tower at Kelly AF Base observed on unidentified flying object at 1945 CST 16 June 1953 for approximately 5 minutes. This object was elliptical shaped and appeared to be equal to the size of a 4 by 94 inch envelope held at arm's length. No aerodynamic features, trail, central or propulsion system were noted. Object disappeared quickly in much the same manner as would a light being extinguished. Observers stated that object was quite similar to a cloud or smoke through which a light was shining.

Discussion
A check with airfields in the vicinity determined that there were no aircraft in the area at the time of sighting. The local ACAW squad-ron was contacted with no results. The observer's statement - "Due to the physical makeup of the object, this sighting could be explained as the reflection of the sun on a high cirrus cloud."

Conclusion
Other - Probably light reflection on cloud.
