UNCLASSIFIED

7. During the period of Mr. _______ observation, the object moved from South to North West. In its steplike progress, the object reached an altitude of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 feet. It required about three minutes for this climb. The light seemed extremely bright at the higher altitude. It hovered at that altitude for perhaps thirty seconds. The point of light was directly above the object at that time. Then the point leaned at an angle of about 70º and point and object moved upward at that angle at tremendous speed and went out of sight. Mr. Farmer stated that he would not even try to estimate the speed. Before disappearing, the object itself became a black blob.

8. When leaning, the point changed position too fast for the eye to detect the actual motion of the changing point, but the whole operation seemed to be accomplished at a relatively slow speed, into Mr. _______ was able to see the object move into position under the point in each of the "stairstep" progressions. After each completed movement, the whole unit seemed to stop and hover before proceeding to the next progression. Each progression appeared to effect a gain in altitude.

9. When first observed by Mr. _______, the point of light was leaning South, but its subsequent progression was from South to North West. The lower lefthand portion of Mr. _______ drawing, attached, omits the steplike progression and shows the starting-point, indicating the gain in altitude achieved by the steplike progressions, and indicates the final "hovering" of the unit before it rose and disappeared from view in the direction he labelled "Finish".

10. Mr. _______ is a pilot, holding Pilot's Ticket a-half years he crop-dusted in Texas, Mississippi, and Florida. He discontinued crop-dusting sometime in 1950. He has more than 2000 hours flying time. He has 20/20 vision without glasses. He stated that he has consumed no intoxicating beverages in a year.

11. Mr. _______ reported that at the time he observed the object the sun was setting, but the red ball of the sun was visible about halfway above the horizon. The sky was still blue, and there were no clouds except for a few small, scattered clouds in the east. The sky had that particular brightness which preceded the coming of twilight. There was no strong wind blowing, and there were no noticeable noises emanating from Robins AFB.

12. On 28 January 1951 Mr. _______ went to the airport at Cochran Field (Macon Municipal Airport). There he asked _______, a colored employee of the airport, if he had seen anything unusual in the sky on Thursday evening. _______ told Mr. _______ that he had seen a streak of fire without any smoke, going West just before sundown, and that he had heard no noise.

13. The Intelligence Office did not consider it necessary to interview _______ since his description of the phenomenon, as related to Mr. _______, was of such vague nature.

14. Mr. _______ has taken no particular interest in the subject of flying saucers. He stated that he has seen Donald Keyhoe's book on that subject but has not read it.

SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. a. Observer:
Mr. [redacted]
Zeigler Apartments
Warner Robins, Georgia

b. Location: Zeigler Apartments area, Warner Robins, Georgia

c. Date and time: 25 January 1951 at "around 1800 hours"

d. Weather C A V U: Clear; visibility 10 miles on 25 January
1951 at 1828 hours. (Official report of
Base Weather Station)

2. Mr. [redacted] Radio Electronics Repairman at Robins AFB,
was interviewed by the Intelligence Office on 28 January 1951. He stated
that on 25 January 1951 he was in his apartment when his 11-year-old daughter ran
in and told him a plane was on fire. Mr. [redacted] went outside and looked up
at the sky, where he observed the phenomenon as hereinafter related. He identified the time at around 1800 hours.

3. Upon first sighting the object, Mr. [redacted] thought it was a jet
plane on fire. He concluded it was not a burning plane because the fire did
not blow back of the object but seemed to be going up from it, and no smoke
was visible. He noticed no noise, vibration, or odor.

4. The object appeared to be dark and "kind of oblong" in shape. The
object itself did not shine; all illumination seemed to come from the light
or fire which went up from the object. For a distance of about 5 or 4 feet
Mr. Rhodes could not estimate the altitude of the object but stated that it
was "a long way off". It seemed to be no more than 5 or 6 feet in length
when sighted by Mr. [redacted]. It did not look like any aircraft he had ever
seen. The illumination was "almost red" in color and was a continuous, steady
glow without any blinking or flickering.

5. When first sighted by Mr. [redacted], the object appeared to be standing
still. It then began to move and disappeared in a due westerly direction,
as well as he could judge. Prior to its disappearance, the object seemed to
be climbing, possibly at a 45 degrees angle. When it disappeared, it seemed
to be moving from "some tremendous force". Mr. [redacted] compared the suddenness
of its departure to "slapping something off a table".

6. Mr. [redacted] does not wear glasses and stated that he had not consumed
any intoxicating beverage on 25 January 1951.

7. Mr. [redacted] did not notice any clouds in the sky. He stated that it
was still bright outdoors when he saw the object.

SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. a. Observer:
[Redacted name]
Zeigler Apartments
Warner Robins, Georgia

b. Location: Zeigler Apartments area, Warner Robins, Georgia

c. Date and Time: 25 January 1951, "around sunset"

d. Weather C A V U: Cleary, visibility 10 miles on 25 Jan 51 at 1826 hours. (Official report of Base Weather Station.)

2. Mr. [Redacted], Aircraft Mechanic at Robins AFB, was interviewed by the Intelligence Office on 29 January 1951. He stated that on 25 January 1951 he was in his apartment when his son ran in and told him that a plane was on fire. Mr. [Redacted] went outside and looked up at the sky, where he observed the phenomenon as hereinafter related. He identified the time as "around sunset".

3. At first glance, Mr. [Redacted] thought the object he saw was a plane on fire. He concluded that it was not an aircraft, but he had no idea what it might be. He could not identify the size or shape of the object, which he saw in the west, "a long way off".

4. Mr. [Redacted] stated that he saw a reddish light, quite bright, and that he heard no noises, saw no smoke and smelled nothing.

5. During the short time he watched the object it was always moving and did not seem to be going faster than an airplane. When first sighted, the light seemed to be hovering at about a 45 degree angle, then it "changed and levelled off".

6. Mr. [Redacted] stated that he felt cold and returned to his apartment without waiting to watch the object go out of sight.

7. Mr. [Redacted] does not wear glasses and stated that he had consumed no intoxicating beverage on 25 January 1951.
