JULY 16, 1961

O.S.I.
Lockbourne Air Base
Columbus,
Ohio

Dear Sir:

November 14, 1950 took some pictures of an U.F.O.
At that time, a member of your organization investigated the pictures.
We were told to not put the pictures on display or try to sell them.
We have done just what we were asked. My son, who just joined an
U.F.O. Club here in Newark, Ohio, without my knowledge, signed a
paper written by Mr. Full Doctor of U.F.O. in Newark. I do
not know the full contents of the letter and I also know the letter
of no legal standing as it was signed by a minor, written by a minor,
and it is not notarized. It was several months ago and does not
remember the contents. I do know that at no time was I given by
our pictures to use in any way. He has some pictures and I know the
Newark High School has a copy plus they are keeping this negative in their
safe. I am not sure where he got possession of the pictures,
but in an off hand way, he told me he got them from the Newark Advocate.

First I had best explain about
years of ago. He (said his Mother) seen to have one aim in life. To bring
the truth to the public of everything and anything that in seen in the sky.
They feel that the Government must hide nothing and tell all. Seeing how
the Club was being handled and what a fanatic was on the subject,
I realized several weeks ago. I talked with Mr. and Mrs. and
they refuse to take the name off of the members. Since quit this
U.F.O. Club, without our knowledge, Mr. put the pictures
on display in Newark, Ohio. My husband and son just jumped to see
them on display and I immediately contacted the owner of the pictures
and he removed them from his window when I explained to him that
I had no right to those pictures, but since he took the
pictures into his store, he returned them to me. I have tried to get
the pictures from and also his Mother, with no success. I have
talked with the editor of the local paper and he tells
me that all information has received from the in their
files was obtained by and that it was all cleared by the
Air Force. After I doubt as I know it was the last school term he
was broadcasting about U.F.O.'s on the radio and he got a little out of hand
and the Air Force came to Newark and looked through his papers. I have
tried talking to the boy, but he feels that he has "got this on something
big." I do not know what pictures were and possibly they are of no
importance and mean do no harm with them, but it would be the same
thing if it was something that should be kept secret for our protection.
Since he is a member of N.J.C.A.P. he feels that they will back him
in every way. I tried to explain that our Government is bigger than NICAP,
but the boy is sold all the way that he must bring the truth to the people.

It is a
club. I would rather my son would be looking through a telescope than run-
ning around with a gang of getting into trouble. There is a nice bunch of
boys in this club but are going to get them all into trouble.


- page 26 -

I am making no excuses for as he received M for signing the letter and belonging to a Club that had a director like. The other boys have not seen through him yet and he has some of them thinking that three men in black from the Air Force are watching them.

Has called into my house so often that I was about to forget I was a Mother and a lady. I think I have the telephone calls stopped.

Mr. and have informed me that they are sending the pictures to Major of NICAP or UFO. The boy has upset our household and I know of another family here in town who also is having troubles with him.

I have tried to stop him but since he isn't of age, I can only go so far. (I was thinking of a good spanking.)

If you care to look into this matter further, his name, address, and telephone number is listed below:

Mr.
Newark, Ohio

I talked to a gentleman from O.S.I. and also one from O.I.S. and I was told to write this letter and explain what had happened. If this letter is not clear, I will answer all questions that I can.

Sincerely,

FLOWER and COOK OBSERVATORIES

1959 July 30

Executive Officer,
Public Information Division
Office of Information Service
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last year the Executive Officer very kindly, in reply to a request from me for information about certain fireballs which appeared in 1957, sent me a considerable amount of useful information, which can be used in the solution of the atmospheric paths and orbits of these bodies.

During the past year or so a large number of fireballs have appeared over the eastern or southeastern states, and in the cases of the five to be mentioned, I have been able to assemble a number of observations. But despite this I find it impossible to make good solutions, I am therefore writing to urgently request that you be good enough to send me copies of any or all reports in your hands, dealing with these bodies.

I may add the Hydrographic Office of the U.S.Navy has for over 30 years effectively cooperated in such work and as a consequence it has been possible to solve for many important fireballs. Such cooperation from your office, as a routine matter, would also be invaluable.

The specific bodies I now request information on are:

1958 April 20/21 Southeastern States     8:20 pm Apr. 20
1958 July 4/5   North Carolina etc.       { 11 pm July 5
1958 Nov. 30    South Carolina etc.       8:10 pm Nov. 30
1958 Dec. 12/13 New York, New Jersey etc. 12:42 am Dec. 14
1959 Feb. 10/11 South Carolina etc.       4:15 am Feb. 11

It would be a great favor to me and useful to science if you would be good enough to send me observations dealing with these fireballs.

Very sincerely yours,

1. In answer to a request by Mr. Olivier, the following information is submitted:

a. 20 April 1953, 2019 MST - Two aircraft at 9000 feet altitude, located at 30 degrees 50'N 83 degrees 15'W, east of Thomasville, Georgia, sighted the following object: round, light green, increasing in intensity as it approached. The aircraft, which was a B-47, and the camera of object, pink, then dark compared to clouds, spread out from the northwest toward the aircraft was like a meteor, having southwest. Object was positioned between the aircraft in orbit, Comm. In a descending curve. The glow just disappeared. Object in view for four seconds.

b. 5 July 1953, 0165 MST - At 31 degrees 30'N, 71 degrees 25'W, an aircraft at 9000 feet altitude sighted the following: an object was observed one and one-half to two miles north of aircraft; object expanded to ignite as ball, pulsating, at about 1000 feet. At about 600 feet, object burst into bright green ball of fire, 100-150 yards outside area. A few more objects were observed nearby, centered after explosion. This same object was seen from a position of 31 degrees 30'N, 71 degrees 30'W and 32 degrees 30'N, 70 degrees 30'W by three other aircraft.

c. 14 December 1953, Yonkers, N. Y., 0645 EST - A large meteor was observed east of a lion traveling in a southwest direction. The color was white, with a tail about as long as the distance from Estelberg to Saigle. No action was in view for approximately one second.

d. 14 December 1953, east of Elmira, N. Y., 0645 EST - A brilliant light, yellow, slightly larger than a quarter, with a dark red tail seven times larger than object, was observed at a great height. It moved from southeast to northwest. Duration of sighting not reported.

e. 14 December 1953, Smithtown, N. Y., 0041 EST - A bright light, green-blue and greenish-white, traveling south to north. Observed for 10 to 15 seconds.

f. 14 December 1953, Sea Girt, Manasquan, Belmar, McGuire AFB, and Lakehurst, N. J., 0350-0400 EST - A round object, size of a large grapefruit, green, brilliant white, orange red, traveled in straight line. From 70 to 7,000 feet to kilometers, as great show. Object was observed for five seconds.

ASTRONOMY
Mars Near and Bright
The red planet Mars will come closest to the earth in November than it will be in many years. Its brightness makes it easy to locate.

By JAMES STOKLEY

> THE PLANET Mars is now most easily seen in the southwestern evening sky. As it approaches closer to earth than it will again until 1971, it is in the constellation of Taurus, the bull, close to a group of bright stars that shine prominently in the winter sky.

These are shown on the accompanying map, which depicts the skies as they appear about the middle of November. (A kind of standard time) now. I am better off in the 15th and two hours earlier at the end of the month.

The brightness of Mars makes it easy to locate. It is now about as bright as Aldebaran, the bright star Aldebaran, rather to the left, in the neighboring constellation of Auriga, the charioteer (and shown on the map of the northern sky).

Below Taurus you may see Orion, the warrior, now hanging above the eastern horizon, it is not as brilliant as it will be on midwinter evening. However, you can make out the three prominent stars in a vertical row, with Betelgeuse to the left and Rigel to the right. Further to the left is the constellation of Gemini, the twins.

Even though we are well into autumn, the summer triangle is still quite high in the west. It consists of Deneb, Vega and Altair.

A fainter star, Alphireo, marks the foot of the cross. Vega is in Lyra, the lyre, which stands to the right of Albireo.

In Aquila, the eagle, off to the left, you will see the star Altair. The stars named are of the first magnitude, which means that they are among the brightest in the sky. Low in the south you will see another of this magnitude, Fomalhaut, in the constellation Piscis Austrinus. Due to Mars' altitude, Fomalhaut's brilliance is considerably dimmed by the absorption of its light in the atmosphere. A first-magnitude star is expected to be nearly as bright as another star of the same magnitude.

This will be about ten million miles further away than it came on Sept. 11, 1956, but that was one of the closest approaches of Mars to earth in the 20th century. Mars comes once in 687 days, while the earth takes only 365 days for a similar trip. Thus at intervals of 780 days, nearly two years and two months, we catch up to Mars. Both planets are then in opposition, or in opposition from the sun. In other words, as we see it from our planet, Mars and the sun are in opposite directions in the sky, and we say that the planet is in opposition, which occurs on Nov. 16.

Mars in Opposition

At such times Mars is much nearer than for many months before or after, when it may be even further than the sun. If both planets were moving in perfectly circular, they would be the same distance apart as every opposition. Actually, the orbits are elliptical, and that of Mars is an elliptical, considerably longer than that of the earth.

The place where the two orbits are near each other is called the earth opposition, or near conjunction. On Aug. 28, if the opposition occurs on that date, Mars is on the closest possible distance, which is about 35,000,000 miles away. If it is in opposition occurs in early March, Mars is still some 60,000,000 miles away.

Thus we had a very close approach of Mars two years ago, Seventeen years before that, on July 24, 1939, it was also close.

Here is the text from the document:

quite favorable, at a distance of 36,171,000 
miles. Its present approach is not as good 
as that, but it is still better than average 
and at many observatories and astronomers are 
taking advantage of it.

Unfortunately, the 1956 observations were 
hampered considerably by bad weather on 
Mars. For several weeks at the critical 
period in August and September, much of 
the planet was obscured by a yellowish 
cloud formation. However, intensive work 
during the last part of the opposition period 
of the world yielded important results, and 
many of these are being checked further 
this fall.

Life on Mars

One of the most interesting was the work 
of Dr. William M. Sinton of Lowell Ob-
servatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., who found new 
evidence for some sort of life. (See p. 363) 
The molecules of which living organisms 
are made contain carbon and hydrogen, in 
a combination that causes certain wave 
lengths to be absorbed in the infrared rays 
which they reflect. Using a spectroscope, 
Dr. Sinton measured the intensity of various 
infrared waves reflected from the surface, 
found a reduction of approximately the 
same wavelength of organic molecules 
are known to cause this absorption. This 
seems to be good evidence of some kind of 
life, perhaps primitive plants, similar to 
lichens on earth.

Dr. Sinton was a very slight one, 
Dr. Sinton has been anxious to try again, 
with better equipment. Now he is making 
new observations, with improved apparatus, 
attached to the largest telescope in the 
world, the 200-inch telescope at the 
Palomar Observatory in California. If his 
results are verified it will be a most im-
portant step in research.
