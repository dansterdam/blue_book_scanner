SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
WALLIS AFB, FLORIDA
23 JANUARY, 1958

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS NEAR ORLANDO, FLORIDA.

Charles Irvimgton
2/28/58
399-43 17th, St.
Lyman, S.C.

R/A

REFERENCE: PERI0DICAL REPORT NO. 10/58.

On 23 January, 1958, the writer interviewed Charles Irvington, who reported sighting three unidentified objects near Orlando, Florida, on 24 January, 1958. The following information was obtained:

At approximately 8:50 p.m. on 24 January, 1958, the witness, who was driving alone on Route 441 between Orlando and Kissimmee, Florida, observed three bright lights in the sky to the northeast. The objects appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and made no sound. The witness stated that the objects seemed to be moving in a triangular formation, but he could not determine their exact shape or size. The lights were visible for approximately 1 minute before disappearing from view.

The witness reported that the objects were brightly illuminated and appeared to be elliptical in shape. He was unable to make a positive identification of the objects, but stated that they were definitely not aircraft, helicopters, or airships. The witness also reported that the objects seemed to be maneuvering and changing direction at a high rate of speed.

The witness was interviewed at his home by the writer and appeared to be a reliable individual. There were no other reports of similar sightings in the area at that time. The USAF records indicate no known aircraft or other aerial activity in the vicinity of Orlando, Florida, on the date and time in question.

The report of this sighting is forwarded for your information and further analysis.

AIR POLICE OPERATIONS
REPORTS AIR FORCE BASE
NEVADA

25 January, 1957

SUBJECT: Statement made by 4/30 

Well around 2230 hrs, 24 January, 1957, we went down Charleston Blvd to Warlis Plaza and on some ground we found on soutnain about 1/2 mile after the second turn-off we turned around and parked at the right side of the road. We could see some lights rising and slowing down and eventually at the size of the planet about two miles away. One of the lights might have just to the right of the car, about two miles away. The other light seemed to be suspended, stationary, and then started to get brighter and move slowly upwards, disappearing into the distance. It was all later than previous sightings we have had in this area. The slow movement and changes in size and clarity is noticed. This was about 15-20 minutes that we saw these objects. There were no sound that we could hear from them.

This is all the text that appears on the page.
