SUMMARY:

At approximately 0053 hrs, 23 January, 1958, the above named subject reported to his wife that he had seen an unknown object near Devers Mountain. Subject was interviewed to come to the Air Police Operations and make a statement. A/C reported to this office and the following information was obtained:

At approximately 0030 hrs, 23 January, 1958, while driving on Highway 95, approximately 20 miles down to the edge of Devers Mountain and parked their car. Several minutes later one of the party sighted a strange blue appearing from behind the car. This was approximately 200 to 300 feet in diameter. The party dispersed the light until it was to be pulling very near to the car. This time it was noted by all four persons that the light was to be moving from an unknown higher than the car. A/C stated that he observed the object several times and thought it was a large object moving slowly at approximately twenty feet from the car some only 15 feet away. The object was described as a bright, round, white light, approximately 15 to 20 ft. The object seemed to stay not at speed twenty feet, traveling along with the car in a perpendicular, viewing with binoculars.

The Provost Marshal of the Day, and Identification Dept. notified. Identification Dept. requested a survey of statement and report.

SECRET                TRAFFIC                 SECRET

Statement made by A/3C [redacted]

Well around 2230 hrs. 24 January, 1957, we went down Charleston Blvd. to Nellis Blvd; and then on up a dirt road on Sunrise Mountain about 1/2 mile after the [redacted] turn off. We turned around and parked to the right side of the road. We had been there a few minutes, and one of the girls noticed a blue tenge light just to the rear of the car, about two miles away. One of the girls got out and started to cry. So I told the girl, "we're probably reflecting from Bolder or some nearby so we didn't pay any attention to it till later when we noticed that something solid, long, and somewhat was down to the car. Gradually the road, towards the mountain as we began to move along the road. We noticed this long thick thing, gave to the girl to look. Then, about 70 or 80 yards from the car, it began to move. We didn't know what it was.

Three got out of the car. In the rear, my A/3C [redacted] [rest of text is redacted]
