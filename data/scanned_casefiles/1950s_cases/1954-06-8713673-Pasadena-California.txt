Monday June 14, 1954

Gentlemen:

I understand we should report 'unidentified' objects. This happened in East Pasadena, California.

Friday June 11, 1954 at approximately 9:00 in the evening my husband and I saw a red object flying at about the speed of an airliner. If left no vapor trail. I can't judge how high it was, and had no blinking lights. As it moved away from us it seemed to back and forth. When it moved, then stop, move then stop.

It made no noise. We saw a plane going in the same direction (possibly following it?) a few minutes later and left a vapor trail.

Sincerely,
[Redacted name]
Pasadena, California
