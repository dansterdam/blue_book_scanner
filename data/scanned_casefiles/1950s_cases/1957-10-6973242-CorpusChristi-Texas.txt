The document contains a sketch, not a photograph. The sketch depicts a simplistic, pointed object resembling an aircraft or missile, moving from left to right.

Here is the text from the document:

23/1/7252 CCT RUJEM

1. Nothing unusual was picked up by radar and
it is doubtful anything this big & far can would
be in this area without being picked up by the
radar.

2. The sighting is probably a misinterpretation
of natural phenomena or an overly active
imagination of a 16 years old boy.
