Dear Sir:

An odd shaped object seemed to be anchored in the air when my Unc'e and his Daughter saw it. They watched it from the porch for some time. My Unc'e went down through the yard thinking he could see it better, but it must have been 200 to 250 feet away. He was "ooking against the bl" and knew it did not go down. He was the only one in the air for he would have seen it. If it did not come down it would be to "roast up the va"ey. It came down in this manner and was approximately "these dimensions". The color was red, but it was a wine red or a brick red. My Unc'e went back but it was in the woods and he did not find anything. (It the end of his farm there is a "large track of woods which connects with the state woods". The object keeps haunting me.

This object was seen on a Thursday or a Friday, March -1959.
It was seen west of Corsica, O'arion county.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]

25 May 1959

Dear Miss

I refer to your letter of 15 April 1959 concerning an Unidentified Flying Object sighting West of Corsica, Clarion County.

Your letter contained insufficient data to allow a valid conclusion. Therefore, I am inclosing U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet which should be completed and forwarded direct to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

When an evaluation and/or analysis has been completed, you will hear from us.

Sincerely,

Incl                                                 LAWRENCE J. TACKER

Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I had my Uncle's answer the questions on the U.S. Air Force Technical Sheets.
Up to this time I had not told him I had sent in any information about seeing
this object.

He said Sunday he would answer any questions, but he did not want a "lot of
pages and to him to be filled out". I think perhaps we have covered what they
saw. If you have any more forms to be "filled out" please send them to me, and
I'll be happy to help.

We did not give his phone number, for it is a "little hard for him to talk"
on the telephone.

I do not have a phone at the office, but my home phone number is [redacted]
Clarion, Pa. exchange.

We haven't said anything about this object being seen, for if something
did come down I know it would not be tampered with.

My Uncle's neighbors are scattered and I don't think he would speak about it,
for he would not want people going back to the wood over his grain field.

If something did come down I would be very hard to "quote", since the foliage
is no the trees.

Perhaps you will know from the information if something did come down.

My Uncle said he watched it for two minutes after his Daughter carried him.
He thought perhaps he would get a better "look if he went down in the yard."
When he went down off the porch he had to pass the garage, and that "covered him about
seven feet."

My Cousin watched from the porch, but she can't say how it disappeared. It
could be she took her eyes off it. I know a second to look at her Dad. It could
have rested down the valley in the wood or come down.

The Sharon to Stroudsburg highway road grade is now coming out on road route 322, (Take-A-See).

You will know if this information is of any interest to you. If you would
like to send someone here or I would meet you at some place, or
if we are not able to we would say "my Uncle's case and to" him.

You can go there and he may be able to tell you everything he could and would take you
to the place if he is well.

Sincerely,
Sig's, Pa.
