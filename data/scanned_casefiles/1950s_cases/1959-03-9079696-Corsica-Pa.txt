The image contains two sketches or diagrams, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line with labels indicating how high an object was observed. The second sketch shows a larger panoramic view with a smaller inset sketch, which appears to be an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sighting). Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when it disappeared from view.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" on the position where you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

Dear Sir:

An odd shaped object seemed to be anchored in the air when two men and his daughter saw it. They watched it from the point of a better - but it must have been about 200 to 250 feet away. It gave off a peculiar light, and they knew there was something unusual about it. They did know well that it did not resembled any type of plane or other air craft they had ever seen before. For about 300 to 350 feet away, it did not appear to move, the only thing it did was give off the peculiar light. These dimensions are approximately 39 to 40 feet as compared to a small tree nearby, but it was in the woods and he did say that it looked larger than that. He felt it was anchored to something in the woods, but he did not know what.  This object was seen at Corsica, Pa. on March 23, 1959.

Sincerely yours,

[Redacted]

Tacker of the Office of Information Services to an unnamed recipient. The letter discusses the writer's investigation of a reported sighting of "flying objects" in Corsica, Clarion County, Pennsylvania.

Text extracted from the document:

25 MAY 1959

Dear Sir:

I appreciate your letter of 13 April 1959 concerning the Unidentified Flying Objects sighting west of Corsica, Clarion County.

Your letter contained insufficient data to allow a complete technical analysis. However, it indicates the Air Force technical investigation of this sighting has been forwarded to the technical intelligence center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

When an evaluation and/or analysis has been completed, you will hear from us.

Sincerely,

U.S. AIR FORCE
AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

Dear Sir:

I had my Uncle answer the questions on the U.S. Air Force Technical Intelligence Information Sheet, as I am unable to answer them.

He said Sunday he would answer any questions, but he did not want to get into any argument with the Air Force, as he knows several men who have argued with them and have had a hard time getting anything done. He said he was very ill at the time and could not appear for a talk on the phone number, for it is a "its" hard for him to talk on the phone.

I do not have a phone at the office, but my home phone number is [redacted]. I don't think we have anything concerning UFOs that the investigators don't already know. My Uncle said he would speak about it if he could, but he thinks he would not be understood. He is quite afraid that something did come down as he said it would be very hard to convince. Since the U.S. Air Force does not wish to have a discussion on this matter, there seems to be nothing further to report.

He said he watched it for two minutes after his Daughter saw it. He said it was on the south-east horizon and was a large round grey object that stayed stationary for a few minutes and then just took off and disappeared. He said it was travelling very fast and so high up we could barely see it. It caused nothing to move on the ground. His Daughter was the first to see it and called him to come and look. He says he and his Daughter are both willing to take a lie detector test, but they don't know how to go about it. It would be about a 20 mile trip for them to come to the Air Force base. 

The location would be about a mile-and-a-half east of Strassburg.

If my letter is not satisfactory to you, please let me know, and I would be glad to give you any other information you may need.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
