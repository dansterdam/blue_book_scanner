STATEMENT OF LT. COLONEL [redacted], and Harbor Police, Manila,
Philippine Islands.

On the evening of 31 January 1953, I was fighting off BREACH COVE, between
HONDO and TULAM POINT, Bataan Province. I was in a small boat fishing
with my family for the past fifteen (15) years, was with me. Our little row boat
was anchored off-shore while we fished.

At about 2030 to 2100 hours, I looked up and noticed four (4) very bright,
fast-moving, disc-like objects high up in the western sky. The disc-like objects
appeared to be in a horizontal position and moving around in a circle. The objects appeared to be transparent with light which seemed to be reflected, moved from a point to another, and the discs appeared to turn or back and assumed a semi-vertical position and disappeared in a north-westerly direction in a flash just as a falling star.

The night was clear with a full moon - there was no wind and the sea was
calm. I did not hear any sound, but the objects were very, very bright. I would say that they were about thirty thousand (30,000) to thirty-five thousand (35,000) feet high.

I have never seen anything like it in all my life. I have seen Jack-o-Lanterns
and numerous falling stars but these luminous, disc-like objects were distinct from anything I have seen in the sky.

I have not divulged this information to any unauthorized individuals and have
admonished my wife to tell no one. I was told by my wife and I concur with
this to avoid publicity at this time. However, I declare to voluntarily give this
information to the United States Air Force authorities upon their request.

I have read the foregoing statement consisting of one page and have initialed
all corrections. I have been given the opportunity to make any modifications, additions or corrections that I desire. This statement is the truth to the best of my knowledge and belief.

STATEMENT OF [redacted], Filipino, Native of Cebu, Cebu Province, [redacted], CITIZEN, [redacted], Philippine Islands.

On the evening of 21 January 1953, Lt. Colonel [redacted], Chief of Secret Service, Bureau of Customs, Manila, Philippines, and I were sitting, From a small box off BHAGAD CVOS, between NORRIS and TARLAC Province.

Between 2030 and 2100 hours I had a strike and in pulling in my line I happened to look up at the sky where I saw three or four (3 or 4) very bright, luminous, round objects which seemed to travel around in a circle. The objects were visible for about two (2) or three (3) seconds. The objects appeared to be about eighteen (18) inches in diameter and seemed to be transparent. They suddenly turned or became more or less stationary, and the objects traveled faster than a shooting star, but did not leave any trail or smoke. In my opinion they were traveling at a much higher altitude than the Japanese planes which bombed CEBU at the outbreak of the last war.

I was frightened and called them to the attention of Colonel [redacted] who had already stated that he had also seen them and advised that he never seen anything like them before in his life.

I have read the foregoing statement consisting of one page and have initialed all preceding corrections. I have been given the opportunity to make any modifications, additions or corrections that I desire. This statement is the truth to the best of my knowledge and belief.
