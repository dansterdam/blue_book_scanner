2. NICAP has referred to the published statement of Rear Admiral Delmar S. Fahrney, USN, Ret., famed as the "father of guided missiles," which reveals his realization of the necessity to know the facts about objects which reportedly enter our atmosphere at high speeds.

3. If our Air Force found that there are some objects -- now referred to as UFOs -- which originated from planets other than earth, then do you think the American public, if given such information, would take that news sensibly and in stride?

4. Do you think the American public should be told all facts relating to all unidentified flying objects?

I wish to take this opportunity to thank you in advance for your courtesy and attention on this. We are deeply appreciative. Your reply will aid us in our fair evaluation of the subjects in question.

Most sincerely,
President, New York City Affiliate of NI

UFO SIGHTING
REDMOND, OREGON SIGHTING
24 September 1959

On 24 September 1959, at 12:00Z (0600 local), Mr. Robert Dickerson, a policeman of Redmond, Oregon, sighted an unidentified flying object. Unable to identify the object, Mr. Dickerson drove to the Redmond FAA Facility and contacted Mr. Laverne Mertz, operator on duty. Mr. Dickerson and Mr. Mertz described the object as an extremely bright light very low on the horizon in the northeastern sky. Both witnesses stated that the object appeared to move erratically around a principal point and to move rapidly toward and away from them. Total observation time was approximately one hour at which time it in Mertz stated the object appeared to zoom straight up at great speed.

After observing the object for several minutes with Mr. Mertz, Officer Dickerson attempted to get closer to the object by driving in an eastward direction. After five miles and no apparent change in the appearance of the object the officer gave up the attempt and Mr Mertz reported the presence of the object to the FAA at Seattle WyNot-Phone". The Seattle FAA facility contacted the 827th AC/RON (Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron) located at Keno, Oregon, and asked if they had a target in the Richmond area and the senior controller answered in the affirmative. Six F-102's, one F-89, one H-29 (Helicopter), and one civilian Tri-Pacer equipped with a geiger counter were vectored to the target area with negative results. The interceptors did not make visual or radar contact and the Tri-Pacer reported negative on radiation.

After the unsuccessful intercept, the 26th Air Division ordered the track number assigned to this target scrubbed.

The UFO report made to ATIC did not contain any information concerning the radar target, but concerned itself only with the visual sighting by Mr. Dickerson and Mr. Mertz. The reason the radar experience was omitted is that the Air Force recognized that the two sightings were really separate events. The FAA log associated the visual and radar sightings. These logs were later made available to Major Donald E. Keyhoe and he attempted to exploit them in an effort to prove that the Air Force was withholding information.

ATIC interviewed Officer Dickerson, Mr. Mertz, and Major Cresman of the 827th AC/RON, and confirmed the fact that the visual and radar sightings were associated only as coincidences. This conversation also narrowed down the direction and elevation, the apparent motions, and the colors and their arrangement associated with the object. From this information it was concluded that the cause for the visual sighting was the refraction of light from the planet Venus. The direction of the planet sighting was with that reported for the object, and the planet had a stellar magnitude of -4.2, or about 13 times brighter than the brightest star. At the initial time of the sighting the planet was slightly below the horizon and was brought into view by the bending of light (refraction) by the atmosphere. Inconsistencies in the atmosphere probably caused the object to appear to have radial motion (toward and away from the observer).

The radar return was determined to have been caused by a gap-filler antenna. Under certain atmospheric conditions this antenna appears on the scope of the 827th AC/RON, and has been observed several times since the 24 September 1959 sighting.

At 1500 30 March 1960, Sgt Rolfe, 25th Air Division called to report that the gap filler antenna is located close to Lapine, Oregon. He also stated that the radar site had seen the same object quite often. Quite often to mean more than 3 times but less than 10, but no specific period for these observations). The site would not commit themselves as to whether this gap filler antenna was considered as part of the normal background for the station.

Communication people of the 25th ADW do not believe the gap filler antenna was responsible for the returns, but rather a mountain peak which is normally out of ranges. Targets of this type are typical of coastal and mountainous areas. Occurring approximately 8 to 10 times a year.

No additional witnesses, other than the two already reported, could be found to confirm the visual sighting.

The 32(th) AC/RON is located at Keno, Oregon. The gap filler antenna is located on South Pauline peak. South Peak is 98 nautical miles NWE of Keno, and 34.5 nautical miles south of Redmond Radio.

In view of the above information, the ATIC feels there is no valid reason to change the original evaluation.

Report as recorded

The classified logs for this station for 24 September 1959 have been thoroughly researched and the following information extracted.

1300 zulu, active Air Defense scramble of 2 F-102 from Portland International Airport to identify unknown flying object. Note this UTOQ was given the track designation of JB-129. The recorders logs for that date which show speed and altitude performance of the track have been destroyed. Reference AFM 181-5, para 190409, page 168, dated 20 Feb 1958 which states that recorders logs and intercept action reports will be destroyed after 3 months.

1311 zulu. Aircraft airborne under control of Mt. Hebo radar site.

1420 zulu. Aircraft returned to base with negative results.

1452 zulu. 2 more aircraft scrambled from Portland for control of this radar site.

1517 zulu. 25th Air Division ordered 2 more F-102 to be held in readiness.

1529 zulu. Aircraft returned to Portland without results.

1608 zulu. 1 F-102 scrambled from Portland for control of this radar site.

1613 zulu. 1 civilian Tri Pacer aircraft took off from Redmond Airport for low altitude search. One of the crew members was equipped with geiger counter.

1614 zulu. F-102 airborne.

1655 zulu. F-102 pilot reported seeing two boats on lake at Paulina Mountain and a muddy condition. He also reported scattered cloud conditions and that the air was bumpy.

1700 zulu. 25th Air Division began an Air Defense exercise

1718 zulu. Scrambled 1 F-102 from Portland for control of this site. This aircraft reported clouds from 20,000 to 12,000 ms. A sighting was sighted near Paulina Lake. This information was passed to the senior controller at the Combat Operations Center at 25th Air Division.

1821 zulu. Tri Pacer returned to Redmond without results. No objects sighted and no radiation noted in the area.


- page 21 -

1823 zulu. Scrambled 1 F-89 from Portland for control of this site.

1829 zulu. F-89 returned with negative results.

1849 zulu. Senior controller at 25th Air Division ordered scramble of H-19 helicopter from Kingsley Field.

2154 zulu. H-19 landed at Redmond with negative results.

2155 zulu. 25th Air Division ordered track No JB-129 scrubbed.

2203 zulu. Air Defense exercise terminated by 25th Air Division

Note: Several scrambles, intercepts, and aw llcssified were performed by control of this radar site as part of the exercise during the period reported.

2230 zulu. Helicopter ordered to return to Kingsley Field

The Senior controller on duty at the time the object was first reported was Captain Gordon R. Poland, AO 1863779 who was transferred overseas to Iceland Air Defense Sector, APO 81, New York by special Order A-198, this hq, dated 1 Feb 1960. Three other directors who were on duty from 1500 zulu to 2400 zulu on 24 September have been interviewed and recall the following:

1. The radar return bearing track No. JB-129 did not move during this period.

2. The radar return was in a position close to gap filler antenna located on a mountain at 8,010' level.

3. Repeated passes were made by the interceptors at levels from 40,000 down to 12,000 feet. The interceptors being directed through our radar return XB-129. No interceptor received a radar return on his airborne radar.

At altitudes below 12,000' msl visual search was conducted under VFR conditions with negative results.

4. Since 24 Sept 1959, several instances have been observed by this Hq wherein no moving radar returns appeared in the same location as those of JB-129. It is their opinion that under certain atmospheric conditions, radar echoes from the gap antenna in that location are received.

This is physically possible and probably under appropriate atmospheric conditions.

5. No specific UFO report was submitted by this squadron although all information obtained was forwarded by voice communication to the 25th Air Division for inclusion in their report.

The Intelligence Section at 25th Air Division has compiled additional information on this incident. If you desire further information, it is suggested that that office be queried.

Redmond, Oregon Sighting - 24 Sept 1959

1. Major Friend, by telephone, contacted Mr Laverne Wertz, FAA, Redmond, Oregon, Mr Robert Dickerson, policeman, Redmond, Oregon and Major Creasman, 827th ACWRON, Keno, Oregon. Mr Wertz stated that the object which was seen at 1200Z (0400 local) was brought to his attention by officer Dickerson. Wertz and Dickerson both described the object as an extremely bright light in the northeastern sky, and very low on the horizon. The object appeared stationary, except for apparent erratic motion around its principal points. The object was observed for more than one hour. Mr Wertz reported the object to ARTC at Seattle, who in turn contacted the 827th ACWRON for identification. Interceptors were scrambled from Seattle and surveyed the area under the control of the 327th. A civilian tri-pacer equipped with a geiger counter was scrambled from Redmond. The results of all intercept attempts were unsuccessful.

2. Major Creasman, 827th ACWRON informed Major Friend that a similar object has been observed several times since the 24th of September by the station's observers. It is believed at the station that either a gap-filler antenna or the terrain is responsible for the returns.

3. On the night of 24 September, Seattle ARTC asked the 827th if they had a target in the vicinity of Redmond. The operator observing the returns on the scope answered in the affirmative. It is believed that this unconfirmed and idle answer was responsible for the FAA report which stated that the visually observed UFO had radar confirmation by the GCI site.

4. At the time of the sighting the star Regulus and the planet Venus are both in the direction of the sighting and just below the horizon. It is the ATIC opinion that refractions of these objects were probably responsible for the visual sighting. The description by the witnesses and the fact that the object appeared generally stationary adds credence to this conclusion.

5. Col Tacker, SAFOI-3d, informed of ATIC action by telephone 14 June 1960. Col Shoop also briefed this date.

6. The following aircraft were scrambled for intercept and/or search of this target:

# A/C    Type A/C    From           Time Scr    Time Down
2        F-102       Portland, Ore   1300Z       1420Z

UFO Sighting, Redmond, Oregon

1. On 24 September 59, at 1200Z, an object was sighted at Redmond, Oregon.
The object was described as a bright light, such as a landing light, changing to an orange hue. It had four protruding lights - red, green, yellow, and white. The main light hovered at 8000' and then rose to 20000'.

The object appeared at 12° elevation and disappeared in flight to the south.
The object was in sight off and on for a period of one hour and 19 minutes.

The method of observation was ground visual. The entire sighting took place during the hours of darkness. The witnesses were Mr Laverne Worley, an FAA station operator and Officer Robert Dickerson, Redmond Police Department.

The weather at the time of the sighting - high, thin, broken clouds and the wind was of an average velocity of 15 knots generally to the south.

The report was submitted by the 1502d AMS at Hamilton AFB, Calif.

2. It has subsequently been determined that on the night of 24 September the 827th ACWRON Squadron, Redmond logged a radar target. The following aircraft were scrambled for intercept and/or search of this target.

[A table follows with details of aircraft scrambled, including type, origin, time scrambled, and time down]


- page 27 -

The radar returns recorded during this period were in a position very close to a gap-filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8000' level.

No interceptor or other search aircraft received either radar returns on the airborne radar or made visual contact with the UFO.

3. Since 24 Sept 59, several instances have been observed wherein new-having radar returns appeared in the same location as those on 24 Sept 59.

No specific UFO report was made by the 827th ACWRON.

4. [Redacted] sent a wire to Secretary Dudley Sharp stating that the object sighted in Oregon on 24 Sept 59, was a space ship powered electro-magnetically. Mr. [Redacted] stated that this ship made fools of the aircraft which were scrambled to intercept, and he requested that Secretary Sharp get the military in line. Major [Redacted] (NICAP) also sent correspondence to Secretary Sharp. Major [Redacted] having learned of the above described radar sighting erroneously connected this with the visual sighting on the same day. This letter also suggests that Secretary [Redacted] got the military in line. The correspondence from both Mr. [Redacted] and Major [Redacted] intimate that the Air Force has the true answer to this sighting, but is not revealing the information.

5. The information provided ATIC concerning the visual sighting 24 Sept 59, is insufficient for a positive conclusion. The object, if the same object, were seen for one hour and 19 minutes, could possibly have been a balloon. There is also the possibility, since the object was seen off and on during the period of the sighting, that the first object seen was a refraction of the star Canopus, with the interceptors and other aircraft themselves being responsible for the subsequent sightings. This case is carried as insufficient evidence in the ATIC files.

Here is the text from the document:

Mr. Sharp, duty officer in Mr. Snyder's office, ext 71252, called to say there will be a 6:30 AP release re flying objects and wants to know if the AF or Mr. Sharp would like to comment.

An organization - National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena-Raymond, Oregon wrote Secretary Sharp saying AF gave false information re flying objects. On 29 Sep 59, Maj Tacker wrote a letter saying it was listed by the AF as insufficient information and believed to be a f balloon. This organization said it was false information, the object was a terrestrial device under intelligence guidance. They will use the AF or Mr. Sharp's comments simultaneously.

Does the AF wish to comment?

Sgt Bollo called in December Mr. [redacted] from NICAP wrote a letter requesting information on this same subject and in January sent a letter to Major Tacker informing you of the evaluation of the Portland, Ore UFO sighting of 24 September 1959. It is carried on the records of ATIC as insufficient information. The ATIC account of the sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that the object was probably a balloon as evidenced by the relatively long period in the area, more than an hour, and the fact that unless equipped with reflectors, balloons are not good radar reflectors. The average direction and strength of the wind at the time of the sighting was South at 15 knots.

APR 25 1960

Dear Senator Jackson:

This is in response to your inquiry of 5 April 1960 in behalf of a constituent concerning the Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sighting of 29 September 1959 near Redmond, Oregon. This reply was delayed while due consideration was given to Mr. Harris' letter in Air Force Headquarters.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center account of this sighting failed to reveal any evidence of radar tracking of the UFO or any success of the attempted intercept. The official Federal Aviation Agency log from the Air Route Traffic Control Center at Seattle-Tacoma Airport in Ruskington, and the National Air Traffic Communication Center are misleading. The official log of the Klamath Falls, Oregon, ground-controlled interception site revealed the following:

Upon notification of the sighting of a UFO in the general area, it was assigned the track designation of JB-129. During the active search for this UFO, six F-102 and one F-89 type aircraft were scrambled under control of the Klamath Falls and Mt. Nebo radar sites. Repeated sweeps were made by the interceptors between 40,000 and 12,000 feet. A tri-state alert was declared and an E-1B helicopter conducted a low altitude search. In addition, a B-47 Strategic Air Command aircraft from Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, was in the area. All the aircraft returned to base with visual and radar negative results.

The radar return bearing track No. JB-129 on the Klamath Falls ground-controlled interception radar was not an unidentified flying object. It was determined by the four senior controllers on duty during the period of the search that this radar return on the ground station was a radar echo from a gap filler antenna located on a mountain at the 6,610-foot level. This radar return did not move during the entire period of the search. This has been further substantiated since 28 September 1959 on several occasions when a similar radar return appeared in the same location. A careful check has shown that under specific atmospheric conditions a nonmoving radar echo from the gap filler antenna is reflected, can be ground-controlled interception. The fact that this radar return did not move is in complete disagreement with ground observers who sighted the UFO visually. They all testified it maneuvered rapidly and at times hovered.


- page 36 -

Letter to Honourable Henry M. Jackson (Cont)

In view of the fact that the radar return on the Klamath Falls scope was promptly identified as not being the erratic moving UFO, no UFO report was submitted by the Klamath Falls station or the 25th Air Division, McChord Air Force Base, Washington. Therefore, after notification by the Federal Aviation Agency of this UFO, no mention was made at that time of a radar sighting, the report submitted by Hamilton Air Force Base, California, to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, stated the manner of operation was "ground visual." The resulting analysis showed there was insufficient data to allow a valid evaluation or conclusion.

The Air Force investigates all UFO sightings in meticulous detail and all data available is used in the final evaluation. The investigation of the UFO phenomena has been placed in responsible hands which include civilian scientists and consultants and an adequate, thorough and honest program is being conducted.

The Air Force informed the National Investigations Committee on 27 March 1960 of all the facts and findings in connection with this particular UFO sighting. Charges that the Air Force is withholding information from the public on the subject of unidentified flying objects are completely unfounded. For your information, there is enclosed the latest Department of Defense press release which clearly states the Air Force position in regard to unidentified flying object sightings.

I trust this information will assist you in preparing a suitable reply to Mr.

SAFIL 123435

29 APR 1960

This is in response to your inquiry of 21 April 1960 in behalf of the [redacted] concerning unidentified flying objects (UFO).

On 25 March 1960 the Air Force informed the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) of all the facts and findings in connection with UFO sighting near Redmond, Oregon, in which Mr. [redacted] expresses an interest. The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) account of this sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking of the UFO or any success of the attempted intercept.

Upon notification of the sighting of an UFO in the general area, it was assigned the track designation of JB-129. During the active search for this UFO, six F-102 type aircraft and one F-89 type aircraft were scrambled under control of Klamath Falls and Mt. Home air divisions. Reported passes were made by the interceptors between 40,000-foot and 12,000-foot level. A SAC Racer aircraft and an H-19 helicopter conducted a low altitude search. In addition, a 2-17 Cessna Air Command aircraft was flown in the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho was in the area. All of the aircraft returned to bases with negative visual and radar results. The radar return bearing track may JB-129 on the Klamath Falls ground-controlled interception (GCI) station was not an unidentified flying object. It was determined by the four radar controllers on duty during the period of the search that this radar return on the ground station scope was a scope echo from a gay filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8,010-foot level. This radar return did not more during the entire period of the search. This has been further substantiated since 24 September 1959 on several occasions when a similar radar return appeared in the same location. A careful check has shown that under specific atmospheric conditions a normally stable ground echo from the gay filler antenna is reflected on the GCI scope. The fact that this radar return did not more is in complete disagreement with ground observers who sighted the UFO visually. They all testified it maneuvered rapidly and at times hovered.

Ltr to Gen Samuel S. Stratton (Cont.)

In view of the fact that the radar return on the Klamath Falls scope was promptly identified as not being the ceramic moving UFO, reports the submitted by the Klamath Falls station on the 25th to Air Division at McChord Air Force Base. Therefore, after notification by the FAA of the UFO (no mention was made at that time of a radar sighting), the report submitted by the 1950A Alturas and Air Communications Squadron at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, to ATIC, in accordance with paragraph 15(c) 1 of Air Force Regulation 200-2, stated the manner of observation was "personal visual" resulting analysis showed there was insufficient data to allow a valid evaluation or conclusion.

Copies of the information contained in the FAA logs have been forwarded to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center for possible additional consideration. The ATIC will communicate with the Klamath Falls CAA and the 29th Air Division at McChord Air Force Base to again verify the above-mentioned facts and, should any additional evidence warrant a change in the evaluation category for this particular sighting, a press release will be made. Based upon all the present data on this sighting, the finding of "insufficient data" is definitely valid.

The Air Force investigates all UFO sightings in meticulous detail and all the data available are used in the final evaluation. The investigation of the UFO phenomenon in being conducted by responsible persons, including civilian scientists and consultants, and as adequate, thorough and honest program is being conducted. Changes that the Air Force is widening the information from the general public are unwarranted and have no basis in fact.

We appreciate your interest in this matter and trust that the information furnished will be of assistance to you.

NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE
ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON 6, D.C.

December 31, 1959

Major Lawrence J. Tacker
Department of the Air Force
Office of Public Information
Pentagon,
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker:

It was reported in local papers and on the newswires that a UFO was seen on the morning of September 24th by a police patrolman and an FAA flight service specialist in Redmond, Oregon. The regional FAA office in Seattle, Washington, reported that the object was tracked on radar for about two hours, and that Air Force jets were scrambled from Portland Air Base on an attempted intercept.

In view of the radar tracking and the involvement of FAA and Air Force personnel, I assume that ATIC has studied the case. What is the conclusion of ATIC?

Secondly, you mentioned earlier this year that the Air Force Project Twinkle had considered the possibility that the so-called "green fireball" were meteorites. Their conclusions had not been released at the time, but you said the project would close down this year. Since the same line, in Air Force magazine, are claiming that most UFOs are explainable as chunks of ice from space, we would like to have the official Air Force position on this matter, including the conclusions of Project Twinkle.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
Secretary of NICAP

NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE
ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON 6, D.C.

March 19, 1960

The Honorable Duffy C. Sharp,
Secretary of the Air Forces,
The Pentagon,
Washington 25, D.C.

My dear Mr. Secretary:

As requested by Members of the NICAP Board of Governors, I am forwarding photo-copies of two Federal Aviation Agency logs showing a report of a UFO sighted and tracked by radar over Oregon on Sept. 24, 1959 as you will see by the accompanying letter from FAA Regional Director of Region 6, these logs were officially released to NICAP at our request.

Also enclosed is a photo-copy of a letter from your official UFO spokesman, Major Lawrence J. Tacker, in which he denies that the UFO was tracked by radar and gives the ATIC opinion that the object was a balloon.

In view of the official FAA evidence, the balloon answer is clearly impossible. No balloon could make such a tight light or exhausts from its base, as described; nor could any balloon attain the high speeds or carry out the described maneuvers which occurred before, during and after the approach of the Air Force F 102 interceptors.

Major Tacker, acting as the official spokesman for the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, states that ATIC labeled this report "insufficient evidence." It would appear that this label was assigned as an excuse to conceal the importance of this sighting, first, detailed evidence was clearly delineated and critically reported by expert FAA observers, Air Force F-102 pilots, expert AGI radar operators at Klamath Falls and a Redmond city policeman.

By Air Force Regulation 200-2, such UFO reports must be sent immediately by electrical means - telephone, teletype or radio - to ATIC Defense, the nearest Air Defense Division, Chief of AF Intelligence, and to your own office. The regulation stipulates that such messages must be given priority. So that two factually must have been known through this preliminary report within a very short time. You will note that the Federal Aviation Agency states the Air Force was promptly informed.

Since the FAA, Klamath Falls GCI and F-102 pilots' reports

must have gone to the Secretary's office, as required, then this detailed information must have been available to Major Tucker, the spokesman officially designated to inform the press and the public in regard to UFOs.

We realize this sighting occurred before you became Secretary of the Air Force. But we are sure that now, as Secretary, you will wish to investigate this release of misleading information, as contained in Major Tucker's letter to NICAP dated Jan. 19, 1960.

Summing up, we believe the following points proved beyond any question:

1. The FAA observers' logged description of the UFO, its strange tongues of light or fire, the exhaust or flame from its base, its alternating hovering and rapid maneuvers, and its swift escape from the AF jets all combine to prove this object was not a balloon.

2. The official FAA statements prove that, contrary to the January 19th AF denial, the UFO was tracked for over 90 minutes by GCI radar operators, which the AF has in the past described as highly expert.

3. The AF was fully aware that its own and the FAA evidence proved this was some unknown device under intelligent control.

4. The spokesman in the Secretary's office deliberately gave NICAP a false answer, or was supplied a false answer by ATIC to be given to NICAP, further, that either the spokesman or ATIC, or both, were following a prescribed Air Force policy of hiding the facts from the public -- a policy set by Air Force Headquarters or by a higher authority.

We respectfully request that we be informed why NICAP was given this misleading answer and if this represents continuing AF policy. We also note that the latest AF "fact sheets" states that 70 UFO reports in the last half of 1959 were dismissed with the label "insufficient evidence." We request that the AF reports in the Redmond case and in these other 59 cases be submitted to a special NICAP subcommittee for evaluation, the conclusions to be released to the press and newscasting media.

The subcommittee would include Capt. R. B. McLaughlin, USN, Navy guided missile authority, _____ President of the Association of American Engineers, Major Dewey Turner, USAFR, former Pentagon monitor of the Air Force UFO project, Blue Book, Col. R. E. Emerson, U.S. Army Reserve, head of Emerson Testing Laboratory, Capt. _____ Pan American Airways, and several engineers and scientists whose names will be available to you after receipt of the requested reports.

The Hon. Dudley C. Sharp, Page three.

In 1957, NICAP -- created as a non-profit organization to determine and make public the facts about UFOs -- offered Secretary Douglas, your predecessor, an eight-point plan of cooperation, including an offer to aid in preparing the American public for later disclosures about the flying objects. We now repeat our offer of cooperation and urge that you give it your serious personal consideration.

We believe that the public interest is best served by honest official statements disclosing the full details of all UFO cases investigated by the U.S. Air Force, and that concealing the facts will only arouse public suspicion and possibly wide alarm.

Respectfully yours,

Major, U. S. Marine Corps, Ret.
Director of NICAP

SAFOI-24/Maj Tucker/mab/72291

25 March 1960

Dear Major [redacted]

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 19 March 1960 addressed to Secretary Sharp concerning the unidentified flying object sighting of 24 September 1959 near Redmond, Oregon. Your letter has been referred to this office for reply.

As mentioned in my previous letter of 19 January 1960, the ATIC second of this sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking of the UFO or any success of the attempted intercept.

The official Federal Aviation Agency logs from the Air Route Traffic Control Center at Seattle-Tacoma Airport and the Redmond Air Traffic Communication Center are misleading. The official log of the Klamath Falls GCI site reveals the following:

Upon notification of the sighting of a UFO in the general area, it was ascertained that designation of JA-124. During the active search for this UFO (1300 to 2155 Z) six F-102 type aircraft and one F-89 type aircraft were scrambled under control of Klamath Falls and Mt. Home radar sites. Repeated passes were made by the interceptors between 40,000' and 12,000' level. A Tri Pacer aircraft and an H-19 helicopter conducted a low altitude search. In addition, a B-47 SAC aircraft from Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho was in the area. All of the aircraft returned to bases with visual and radar negative results. The radar return bearing track number JR-129 on the Klamath Falls GCI station was not an unidentified flying object. It was determined by the few sectors controllers on duty during the period of the search that this radar echo from a gap filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8,010' level. This radar return did not move during the entire period of the search. This has been further substantiated since 24 September 1959 on several occasions when a similar radar return appeared in the same location. A small check was made under specific atmospheric conditions a non-moving radar echo from the gap filler antenna is reflected on the GCI scope. The fact that this radar return did not move is completely dissonant with ground observers who sighted the UFO visually. They all testified it maneuvered rapidly and at times hovered.

SAFOI-3a/Maj.Tacker/mhb/72891

19 January 1960

Dear Mr [redacted]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 31 December requesting various facts concerning unidentified flying objects as investigated by the United States Air Force.

The Portland, Oregon UFO sighting of 24 September 1959 is carried on the records of ATIC as "insufficient information." The ATIC account of the sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that this object was probably a balloon as evidenced by its relatively long period in the area (more than an hour), and the fact that unless equipped with reflectors balloons are not good radar reflectors. The average direction and strength of wind at the time of the sighting was south at 15 knots.

Project Twinkle was discontinued in the last quarter of the calendar year 1951. The conclusions from the project were that unmanual phenomena could be attributed to such man-made objects as airplanes, balloons, rockets, etc.; others were attributed to natural phenomena such as flying birds, small clouds and meteorites. There was no mention in the conclusions as to the specific composition of "green fireballs."

ATIC is familiar with the theory of Dr. Donald Robey concerning the composition of "green fireballs", but as yet these theories have not been substantiated. Air Force studies of meteors have not revealed any data which would lead to similar conclusions as those proposed by Dr. Robey.

In view of the fact that the radar return on the Klamath Falls scope was presently identified as not being the erratic moving UFO, no report was submitted by the Klamath Falls station or the 25th Air Division at McChord Air Force Base. Therefore, after notification by the PAO of this UFO (no notice was made at that time of a radar sighting), the report submitted by the 1502nd ACS at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 1 of AFR 200-2, stated the number of observation was ground visible. The resulting analysis showed there was insufficient data to allow a valid evaluation or conclusion.

However, because of the information contained in the PAA logs, your correspondence and the copies of the logs have been forwarded to ATIC for possible additional consideration. ATIC will contact the Klamath Falls GCI site and the 25th Air Division at McChord Air Force Base to again verify the above mentioned facts and, should any additional evidence warrant a change in the evaluation category for this particular sighting, you will be informed immediately and a press release will be made simultaneously. Based upon all the present data on this sighting, the finding of "insufficient data" is definitely valid.

The Air Force investigates all UFO sightings in meticulous detail and all the data available is used in the final evaluation. The investigation of the UFO phenomenon has been placed in responsible hands which include civilian scientists and consultants and an adequate, thorough and honest program is being conducted. Charges that the Air Force is withholding UFO information from the general public are unfounded and have no basis in fact.

For your information I am sending copies of this letter to Mr. Eugene Kruyt, Assistant to the Regional Manager of PAA Region 4, and Mr. [redacted], Del Sales, Oregon who has expressed a serious interest in this sighting.

Thank you again for your interest.

AIR FORCE CONTRADICTS
FAA REPORT

A new letter denying a Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) report that a UFO sighted last September 24 in Redmond, Oregon, was tracked by AF radar, is being circulated by the Air Force. FAA observers had watched the rapidly maneuvering UFO and reported it to the Air Force.

After AF radar confirmed the sighting, the FAA said, jets were sent up to intercept the object. The FAA logs state that AF radar was still tracking the UFO more than an hour later "at altitudes that vary from 4,000 to 54,000 feet." The new Air Force letter implies that GCI radar were not confused by a blip from a stationary antenna on a nearby hillside which "was promptly identified" as not being the erratic moving UFO.

No information obtained by NICAP an explanation of the contradictory reports, and a news release following a NICAP letter to AF Secretary Dudley Sharp asking for an explanation of the contradictory reports, instead the second reply came from the regular UFO spokesman admitting that there had been a radar target, but denying that it was a UFO blip. The same reply has been given through their members who inquired through their representatives.

Apparently unaware until then of the full FAA reports, the AF said: "Copies of the information contained in the FAA logs have been forwarded to Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center for possible additional consideration."

Elsewhere in its reply, the AF also said that nine aircraft had conducted an active search for the UFO: seven Jet fighters, a B-47 bomber, and a Trimocar which later searched the area for signs of radioactivity. The AF said none of the planes made visual or radar contact with the UFO.

Anticipating a flood of queries after the NICAP press story broke, the AF rushed out the long, impressively detailed answer, knocking down the radar report which NICAP said had been suppressed, and the reply consisted of two basic statements:

RECENT SIGHTINGS 1960
Redmond, Oregon, 24 September—Authorities checked an report of an object sighted by many over this central Oregon town. Patrolman Robert Dickerson first saw the object which he said came to within 200 feet of the ground and moved from side to side. He called Redmond Airport and notified Laverne Wertz at the control tower who also sighted the object, and according to a UPI report in the San Francisco News-Call Bulletin, Wertz described it as round and flat; both he and the patrolman said it glowed in color of pale green, yellow and red and at times shot blue bursts of flame. They claimed that it hovered over the area for at least an hour. Wertz also told the press that the Seattle FAA authorities told him the object was observed on a radar screen for about two hours at altitudes of 6000 to 25,000 feet, and that jet interceptors dispatched from Portland air base failed to catch the object which vanished in clouds at about 14,000 feet. Wertz also quoted FAA authorities as informing him that the report was sent to Hamilton AFB, California for investigation.

(1) An active GCI (Ground Control Intercept) radar site had suddenly been fooled by a blip from a fixed antenna, had "promptly identified" it as such, (but apparently had not bothered to explain this to the FAA either then or later.)

(2) The non-moving radar target could not have been the UFO reported visually because "they all testified it maneuvered rapidly and at times hovered," the AF said.

Dear Sir:

I would like to know ATIC's conclusions on the UFO seen over Newark, N.J.
airport and vicinity on July 11th. Were jet fighters scrambled to intercept
the UFO and did aerial tower operators observe the object on radar?

Would also like to know ATIC's conclusions on the Martell and Redmond, Oregon
cases. (Oregon sighting was on Sept. 21, 1959) In the Redmond case, was the
UFO tracked by radar and were jet fighters scrambled?
