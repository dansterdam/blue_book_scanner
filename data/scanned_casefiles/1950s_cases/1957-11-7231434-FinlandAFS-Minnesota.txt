AFTER INTERVIEWING ALL PERSONNEL CONCERNED THIS OFFICER IS OF

THE OPINION THAT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OBSERVED AT FINLAND

AFS ON 5 NOV CURR AT SUNSET 17452 I ROUND OBJECT, WHITE AND RED 5

TIMES BRIGHTER THAN OTHER HEAVENLY BODIES, 9 TO 14 TIMES LARGER

THAN A STAR, APPEARS IN THE SKY, 15 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON, 211

DEGREES AZIMUTH FROM FINLAND MINN, THIS OBJECT IS CLEARLY VISIBLE

ABOUT 1-1/2 MILES MOVING FROM 211 TO 225 DEGREES FROM FINLAND

WHICH CAUSES BELOW THE HORIZON, ITS MOVEMENT IS SO SLOW

THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO WATCH THE OBJECT OVER A STATIONARY FIX FOR

TO DETERMINE MOVEMENT. IT DOES NOT MAINTAIN STATIONARY POSITION WITH OTHER HEAVENLY BODIES. WHEN IT VANISHES

THE HORIZON, IT IS AS A PERSON WERE TO TURN OFF AN ELECTRIC

LIGHT.
