China Lake, California

Sir:

Thank you for your letter of 7 October 1956 in which you submit a report of an unidentified flying object observed from your station.

Definite identification of your sighting has not been made as yet. However, the information will be used in our continuing investigation and analysis of the phenomena in question.

We are certain that you are aware that you are located in an area which is surrounded by a number of flight-test stations, airfields and other related aerial activity sites, as review of a detailed map will indicate.

From your brief description and speed of the objects observed, the possibility that they were jets or jets may be given consideration. However, on the basis of your statement that the objects "wavered" in flight may rule out the former. You may rest assured that the matter will be given proper study.

Your interest in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

ROBERT E. O'CONNOR
Captain, USAF
Assistant Adjutant

1956 Oct. 07, Sun.

Commanding Officer
United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

This last Friday I saw something which I feel I should report; and since I don't know exactly who to report it to, am addressing this to your office, trusting it will be relayed to the correct person, office or organization. Am answering the questions in the order in which I find them in a copied Air Force Form in one of the appendices in Major Donald E. Keyhoe's "Flying Saucers from Outer Space"; April, 1954 printing.

For whatever these "flying saucers" are or are not, on my word of honor the following is what I actually saw, and the circumstances under which I saw them. This last Friday night, at about 10:48 P.M., was when I saw this (from "unidentified objects"). The date - October 5, 1956. Time of day, as given above, 2246, Pacific Standard Time, or 0648, GMT, Saturday morning.

My geographical location was at China Lake, Calif., within the U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Station civilian community. In one of the many type buildings the Navy has built. I was out in the patio of the hollow square-shaped building, this open square being about 75 feet square, with the surrounding building two stories, or about 16 feet high. My position was about 50 feet from the south side of the opening; and, consequently, 45 feet from the north side.

This left about 135 degrees of open sky to my view in the north-south direction. The night was clear; no clouds and there was no moon. The stars were very clear. All of a sudden I saw the things, a row of luminous things about as bright as the brightest stars (excluding Mars or any other visible planet), but looking like spots of light with faintly luminous rings about them, the rings being about five minutes or so of arc in diameter. They were arranged in a tight, grouped east-west row, and were somewhat irregular in this arrangement, though not too much so. And as they travelled, they wavered a bit, the way one would expect of a flock of birds.

As I watched them, they swept across the visible portion of the sky from my viewpoint, from north to south, covering the distance from limit to limit in about 9 or 9 seconds of time. They were separated from each other by only about two of their diameters center to center between adjacent ones; and there were about eight of the objects altogether. They travelled practically due south, and passed the zenith, or overhead point, by about five degrees of arc, passing to the west of this point.

This is all I have to report, since it includes just about all the facts involved that I can recall.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature area blacked out]
