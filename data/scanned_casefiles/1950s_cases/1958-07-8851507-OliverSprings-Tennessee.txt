11 July 1958
Silver City, Texas

CLOSE TEXAS SIGHTING: A strange cigar-shaped object, brightly illuminated with a trailing green glow, was reported by Mr. and Mrs. J.F. Silvey of Silver City, Texas on the night of July 11th. The couple was awakened by the sound of wolves howling nearby, and got up to investigate. The UFO passed almost directly over their house, and was so close that they could hear the throbbing of the motor. It was traveling at great speed, but stopped twice and just hovered for a few seconds each time. The main body of the object was about 50 feet long, according to the witnesses, who watched it through field glasses.
