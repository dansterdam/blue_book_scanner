SPRING 1952 HASSELBACH, SAXSONIA                                    (CRAMP P 158)        2 WITNESSES
OF                                     NEAR MEININGEN, SWORE AN AFFIDAVIT BEFORE A O:

JUDGE AS FOLLOWS:
I WAS RIDING HOME ON __, MOTOR CYCLE WITH MY ELE __-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
ON THE PILION, WHEN A TIRE BURST NEAR THE VILLAGE OF HASSELBACH.
AS WE WERE PUSHING THE MACHINE TOWARDS HASSELBACH, GABRIELE POINTED TO

SOMETHING ABOUT A HUNDRED-AND-FIFTY YARDS AWAY- AT FIRST SIGHT IN THE HALF-
LIGHT. I TOOK IT FOR A YOUNG DEER.
I LEFT MY MOTOR CYCLE BY A TREE WHILE I APPROACHED THE *DEER* CAUTIOUSLY.
I WAS NOW ABOUT SIXTY YARDS FROM IT.
I HAD THEN REALISED THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSION HAD BEEN INCORRECT. THE THING I
HAD NOTICED WAS REALLY TWO APPARENTLY HUMAN FIGURES NOW ABOUT FIFTY YARDS
FROM ME.

THEY APPEARED TO BE CLOTHED IN A KIND OF SHIMMERING METALLIC SUBSTANCE, AND
WERE BENDING DOWN AND STUDYING SOMETHING ON THE GROUND.

I WORMED MY WAY TO WITH ABOUT THIRTY FEET OF THEM, PEERING OVER A SMALL
RIDGE. I NOTICED A LARGE OBJECT, WHICH I JUDGED TO BE ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY
FEET ACROSS. THOUGH IT WAS HARD TO SAY EXACTLY, I LOOKED LIKE A HUGE

WARNING PAN.
THERE WERE TWO ROWS OF HOLES ALONG THE SIDES, ABOUT A FOOT-AND-A-HALF FROM THE NEXT.
EACH ROW WAS ROUGHLY A FOOT-AND-A-HALF FROM THE NEXT. *CONNING TOWER* ABOUT
OUT OF THE METALLIC OBJECT ROSE A BLACK CYLINDRICAL.

TEN FEET HIGH.
I WAS NOW ALARMED BY A CALL FROM MY DAUGHTER WHO HAD REMAINED SOME
DISTANCE BACK. THE SOUND MUST HAVE REACHED THE TWO FIGURES, FOR THEY RUSHED
BACK TO THE OBJECT, CLAMBERED RAPIDLY UP THE SIDE OF THE CONNING TOWER AND
DISAPPEARED INSIDE.

PREVIOUSLY I HAD NOTICED THAT ONE APPEARED TO BE CARRYING A LAMP ON HIS
CHEST. THE LAMP FLASHED ON AND OFF AT REGULAR INTERVALS.

THE OUTER EDGE OF THE *WARMING PAN* IN WHICH THE HOLES WERE SUNK, NOW
STARTED TO GLOW.

THE COLOR AT FIRST SEEMED GREEN, THEN CHANGED TO RED. AT THE SAME TIME I
HEARD A SLIGHT HUM. AS THE GLOW AND THE SOUND INCREASED, THE *CONNING TOWER*
WAS RETRACTING INTO THE CENTER OF THE *WARMING PAN* AND THE WHOLE OBJECT ROSE
SLOWLY FROM THE GROUND.

THAT THE WHOLE OBJECT WAS SPINNING LIKE A TOP.
IT SEEMED TO BE RESTING ON THE CYLINDRICAL PIECE WHICH HAD SUNK THROUGH THE
CENTER OF THE OBJECT AND WAS NOW PROTRUDING FROM THE BOTTOM AND STANDING ON
THE GROUND.

THE *WARMING PAN* WITH ITS GLOWING OUTSIDE RING OF FLAME, WAS NOW SOME FEET
OFF THE EARTH.

THEN I NOTICED THAT THE WHOLE OBJECT WAS RISING SLOWLY FROM THE EARTH. THE
CYLINDER ON WHICH IT HAD RESTED HAD NOW DISAPPEARED INSIDE THE CENTER AND
REAPPEARED AGAIN THROUGH THE TOP.

THE RATE OF ASCENT NOW BECAME MUCH GREATER, AND AT THE SAME TIME MY
DAUGHTER AND I HEARD A WHISTLING SOUND.
FALLING BOMB. BUT NOT NEARLY SO LOUD.

THE OBJECT ROSE IN HORIZONTAL POSITION, SWERVED AWAY TOWARDS A NEARBY
VILLAGE AND DISAPPEARED. STILL GAINING HEIGHT OVER THE HILLS AND FOREST
TOWARDS STOCKHEIM.

SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE IN THE AREA LATER TOLD ME THEY HAD SEEN SOMETHING, WHICH THEY TOOK FOR A COMET. ONE, A SHEPHERD, WHO WAS
ABOUT A MILE-AND-HALF AWAY, SAID HE THOUGHT A COMET HAD BOUNCED OFF THE
EARTH.

A SAWMILL WATCHMAN TOLD HERR _____ HE HAD SEEN WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A *LOW
FLYING COMET* FLASH AWAY FROM THE HILL WHERE HERR LINKE SAW THE OBJECT.

AFTER APPEARING BEFORE THE JUDGE, HERE _____ SAID, *I WOULD ALMOST HAVE
BELIEVED THAT MY DAUGHTER AND I HAD DREAMED THE WHOLE EPISODE WERE IT NOT FOR
ONE THING.

*WHEN THE THING HAD GONE, I WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD BEEN STANDING. I
FOUND A CIRCULAR DEPRESSION, EVIDENTLY FRESHLY MADE, WHERE THE EARTH HAD
BEEN DRIVEN DOWN.

*THIS WAS EXACTLY THE SHAPE OF THE *CONNING TOWER*. I REALIZED THEN THAT
I HAD NOT BEEN DREAMING.*

Luminous flying object over Iran
There have been many sightings reported of unknown objects observed on the
Soviet-Iranian border and the following represents a cross-cut of the sight-
ing:

15 Mar 52     Description: Luminous object 3 meters long moving with
              extraordinary speed appeared and disappeared 30 to 40 times
              after 2000 hours. (Comments: It is unlikely that this was
              caused by meteors)

y in the Sky        From editorial page of BOSTON HERALD         May 5, 1952

HAVE YOU HEARD
                    By Bill Schofield

This is bargain day in the flying saucer department, and you're getting two stories for the price of one—The first from a resident of western Massachusetts, and the second from Navy Secretary Dan Kimball.

Personally I don't care how many people believe stories like these, or how many swear at them. But as far as I'm concerned, I'll continue to collect them and catalogue them and puzzle over them with an open mind until somebody comes up with a hard-fact explanation of all the weird things that have been going on in the skies during the past five years. So far, nobody has been able to do this.

When and if they do, I'm convinced it will be one of the biggest news stories of all time.

For the first of today's incidents, then, let's go westward to the town of Greenfield, where Dr. Albert Baller sighted three big flying spheres traveling at fantastic speed one day last February.

This time the story is told by Charles T. Earley, a 35-year-old tap and die worker, who was startled half out of his wits on the afternoon of March 20 by a visit from a pair of flying rings.
