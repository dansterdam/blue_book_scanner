TRINIDADE ISLAND
1958

The Air Force received its information on this case from the U. S. Navy; it evaluated the photographs as a "Trick".

Although a detailed investigation was not undertaken by the Navy, the photographs furnished by the Brazilian navy were reviewed and found to be inconclusive. Lasid detail is sharp, but the also appears to be little contrast, and shows no shadow effect. It also appears that the photographer's "friends" are extremely sharp, but the actual object photographed appears to be blurred as would occur in taking pictures of an extremely distant object.

The man who made these pictures had no connection with the Brazilian navy; he was a professional photographer, and an expert in such work. However, of the Brazilian navy reported seeing the UFO; in addition to the photographer, only two persons, both of them friends of the photographer, reported seeing the UFO.

This sighting is still carried as a TRICK in Air Force files.

"THE A.F.O. BULLETIN
March, 1960
TRINIDADEI*
Since my last report on the unidentified object seen by the crew of the Brazilian ship "Almirante Saldanha" off the island of Trinidade, I have received additional information.
The ship, as you may recall, had been off the island on January 16, 1958 and the crew observed and photographed what appeared to be a metallic object hovering over the island. The incident created considerable interest and was widely reported in the Brazilian press.
I have since learned that after returning to port, the crew was debriefed by Brazilian naval authorities. The officer in charge of the "Almirante Saldanha" was ordered to submit a full report on the incident, including the photographs taken.
A copy of this report has now been obtained by the Air Force. It contains the following additional details:
1. The object was first sited at about 1:30 p.m. on January 16th, hovering over the center of the island at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. It was described as being metallic in appearance, circular in shape, and about 40 feet in diameter.
2. As the ship approached to within about 3 miles of the island, the object began to ascend vertically at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view in less than 10 seconds.
3. During the approximately 4 minutes the object was under observation, it did not make any horizontal movement, but remained stationary over the center of the island.
4. The crew member who took the photographs stated that he had a good view of the object through binoculars and could see no protrusions, windows, or other exterior features.
5. According to the report, the object's departure from the island was observed by personnel of the Brazilian Navy's Hydrographic and Navigation Service, who were stationed on the island.
In addition to the foregoing, I have also obtained copies of some of the photographs taken by the crew of the "Almirante Saldanha". These show the object clearly, and prove that it was a real and substantial phenomenon, not an hallucination or optical illusion.
The Air Force has carefully analyzed the photographs, and they have been found to be authentic and undoctored. The photographic evidence, combined with the detailed eyewitness accounts, leaves little doubt that some type of unusual aerial object was present over Trinidade Island on January 16, 1958.
It is my considered opinion that this case represents one of the most puzzling and interesting incidents in the history of Project Blue Book. The Air Force is continuing its investigation, and I shall keep you informed of any further developments."

Text from the document:

TRINIDADE INCIDENT
Trinidade Island, located about 700 miles off the coast of Brazil, was the scene of a UFO incident on January 16, 1958. The incident was reported by several members of the crew of the Brazilian Navy ship "Almirante Saldanha" while the ship was anchored near the island.
ABOUT THE INCIDENT
When the crew was making observations around the position, a strange object was sighted high in the sky. Special observations were made and the object was identified as a metallic, disc-shaped craft. Navy authorities refused to make any comment on the incident at the time.
Later, the news was denied by the Brazilian Navy, but it was reported by the press. The Brazilian Air Force stated that no planes were in the area at the time. The incident received much publicity in the Brazilian press. However, the permission to publish any details was denied by the Navy General Staff. It was said that the Navy had no responsibility for the incident and that "official communique" would be published.
The following text was published in an "official communique" dated 20 January 1958:
"On the morning of January 16, 1958, when the school ship "Almirante Saldanha" was at anchor near Trinidade Island, members of the crew sighted an unidentified flying object in the sky. This object took some pictures of the event. The Navy had no connection with the case, and its only communication was the affirmation that the incident had in fact occurred. The Hydrographic Office and the Ship's Commander felt it was a matter that did not fall within their jurisdiction, and hence they came back with the ship to Rio de Janeiro."
The Naval Staff Command had already stated that no photographs were authorized to be taken, and no further information would be provided. The news and flying saucer signers received no official response. There were no further developments reported.

"THE A.P.R.O. BULLETIN

March, 1960

Trinidade:

The incident which occurred on this island south of Brazil on January 16, 1958 when the USS subchaser Almirante Saldhana spotted a strange object in the ocean and contacted the Navy for assistance, is still very much in evidence. By the end of August, 1958, the Brazilian Navy had received 1253 reports of unidentified flying objects sighted by personnel of the ship. These strange objects were variously described as silver metallic, round, disc-shaped and surrounded by a greenish glow. The whole incident is well-documented and there are signed statements from the commander of the ship, Almirante Saldanha, as well as other officers and crew.

The sightings were made at various times during the day and night, sometimes hovering and sometimes moving at very high speeds. Flashes of light were also observed coming from the object, and on some occasions, smaller objects were seen emerging from the main body of the strange craft. The main object itself was estimated to be about 60 feet in diameter. 

There were many observers on the ship and their testimony was confirmed by a military report by a naval officer who was present. The object was tracked by radar and photographed by Lt. Jose Teobaldo Viegas, the ship's photographer. He stated that the object was metallic, shaped like two saucers placed rim to rim and was under intelligent control.

The Navy ordered the ship to close on the object, but as they neared it, the strange craft rose vertically and disappeared from sight very rapidly. This incident is considered one of the most important and best-documented sightings on record. The photographs and official reports are on file with the Brazilian Navy."

The image contains a series of photographs that appear to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text mentions that the photographs were taken by a Brazilian Navy photographer on Trinidade Island, some 600 miles east of Rio de Janeiro. The photographs show what appears to be a "flying saucer" photographed from an ALMIRANTE SALDANHA ship.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

INFORMATION REPORT
OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE 
39-58
RECEIVED: 24 FEB 1958
FROM: 13FEB 1958
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) TRINIDADE ISLAND. 
BRAZIL - Navy - Flying Saucer Photographed from ALMIRANTE SALDANHA
THE No 3000.

1. (U) Set of 4 Brazilian Navy photographs of subject "flying saucer"
a. According to an article in the leading Brazilian newspaper 0 GLOBO dated January 22, 1958, the photographs were printed in that newspaper showing an alleged "flying saucer" photographed from the Brazilian Navy ship ALMIRANTE SALDANHA about 600 miles east of Rio de Janeiro. The ship at the time was engaged in a scientific research expedition in the South Atlantic.

2. Photographer. The photographs themselves were taken by a Brazilian Navy photographer attached to the expedition.

3. The photographs show a disc-shaped object of a luminous appearance against the sky. It appears to be metallic in nature since reflections and shiny areas are visible. The object is shown in various positions against the sky. Another time it appears to be partly obscured by a cloud or haze. The negatives were reportedly sent to Rio de Janeiro for analysis.

4. Analysis. It is the opinion of the Department of the Navy that the "flying saucer" photographs represent an authentic unidentified aerial object. The photographs do appear to be genuine and the individuals and agencies involved above appear to be competent and reliable. No other explanation is readily available at this time.

INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: U.S. Naval Attache, Rio

REPORT NO.: 59-59 DATE: 17 March 1958

Offended because I don't doubt the authenticity of your photos but I need to obtain information regarding them. There are no marks on the photos or anything to indicate specialized trick photography but not one would withstand close and detailed examination.

The Brazilian Navy stated immediately after the photographs were taken that the object appearing in the photos was not a real object. However, the original negatives were sent to the other armed forces "and to the committee set up by the Brazilian Government to investigate the incident." After a long period of time the committee became convinced of the veracity of the happening.

On the Trinidade incident, the press for some time was prohibited from the publication in the press. The Navy Ministry finally made an official statement, in which was said that "The object photographed cannot be the result of trick photography, nor of optical illusions. This Cabinet declares that the only information of this nature which it can release to the public is that which emanates directly from the Admiralty."

I personally visited Trinidade Island at the invitation of the Navy, and in the presence of seven high-ranking naval officers, made detailed photographs of the terrain, vegetation and so on, but I cannot make any pronouncement concerning the object seen because the photographs obtained of the object cannot be made public.

WESTWARD THE ALLIANCE AND THE BARGAINING POWER go. But why? The reasons are complex, and the evidence as yet is not complete. Not since the decline of the Roman Empire in the West, some 1500 years ago, has the West seen such a loss of power and prestige.

INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: U.S. Naval Attache, Rio

REPORT NO.: 59-58

DATE: 11 March 1959

PUBLICITY: The press reports after the publication of the photographs of unidentified flying objects on Trinidade Island were published, CAPT. GELMIRO RIBEIRO BETTENCOURT, chief of the SALVADOR SAP WING, reported that personnel of SALVADOR were under orders not to speak about these phenomena. Federal Deputy Sergio Magalhães sent a note to the Navy Ministry on witnesses' behalf for the first time in flying saucer history, the publication of these photos was prohibited by superior officers. Threats to national security require greater official attention and action. He stated that the Navy had forbidden the publication of such material, claiming it was a matter of national security.

INFORMATION REPORT
FROM:  U.S. Naval Attach'es, Rio 
REPORT NO:  58-58
DATE:  11 March 1958

Preparing Officer's Comments:
1. Most flying saucer stories are not worth wasting much time or effort to investigate. This case DOES appear to be something more than the usual "sighting" as it is substantiated by official Navy photographs.  However, the unfortunate further investigation provided only frustration at every turn, as all angles of approach were met with hostility by Brazilian authorities, and the object remains unknown.

2. There appear to be only two explanations for this peculiar incident:
(a) Some overwhelming power has told the Brazilian Navy not to reveal the truth - this I do not believe as it would be superfluous speculation and hard to prove.  
(b) The whole thing is a fake publicity stunt put on by a crackpot. This seems likely as the strange appearance of the object, that it was immediately photographed, and the way the Brazilian authorities have treated the matter would lead one to believe the photos and incident may be just another effort to gain some cheap publicity - the kind that is well known propensity for never letting the truth stand in the way.

In addition, the photographs furnished by the Brazilian Navy are not of good quality and do not appear to show conclusively that the object was intended to photograph a recognized phenomenon. They appear that the object was intended to photograph a comparison in size and distance, and there appears to be no lateral drifting as would occur with any sizable object.

In conclusion, this officer's opinion is that the Brazilian authorities have not told the full story, and that the incident on Trinidade Island is probably a publicity stunt and the photographs are not of a genuine unidentified flying object.

CASE NO: 6957752 
EVALUATION: BL-U
DATE OF REPORT: 15 JAN 1958

1. LOCATION: On or about Trinidade Island, Brazil. 
2. DATE/TIME GROUP: About 1500Z, 16 JAN 1958.
3. WITNESSES: (1) See or 4 Brazilian Merchant Seamen.
4. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: On or about the date and time stated above, the witness(es) reportedly observed a strange aerial object described as a large, disc-shaped, metallic object hovering over the sea near Trinidade Island. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes. It was silvery in color and appeared to reflect sunlight. The object was seen to ascend slowly and then depart at a high rate of speed. 
5. PHOTOGRAPHS: The object was photographed.
6. EVALUATION: ANALYSIS OF PHOTOGRAPHS BY NAVY PHOTOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE CENTER: The photographs show a well-defined, silvery, disc-shaped aerial object. However, the object appears to be out of focus and at a considerable distance from the camera. The visual report is corroborated by the photographic evidence. 
7. CONCLUSION: The photographs and witness statements constitute credible evidence of the presence of an unidentified aerial object in the vicinity of Trinidade Island on the date and time stated. The object appears to be of extraterrestrial origin.
