Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The document contains two sketches illustrating these instructions, with a figure standing on a road and a curved line representing the horizon.

I was standing at 1600P, 3 miles SE. takeoff from tower and VIA. Based from 1/16 to 1/8 mile control and received to an area ENE of Spokane Wash. The single though to runway to be stay jet within of the ABLE had field and we were PNB to area of last sighting. Our 2 F-86's were in the same approximate position, almost abreast, and at 25,000 and 21,000 the lower being my altitude. We were sent to turn back toward complete when I obtained contact 5 mi, right 45°. Before I will call it to radio 2 or 3 able called a contact at the same position followed a few seconds later by a "lost contact". My contact remained good and I attempted to specify height the target to obtain a "fix". At I

did so the target move very steeply and
rapidly off the cape at the 45° position.
It entered to more right off the cape, being
on 15 mi sweep. Swinging to other side, while
combat was attained. I was now able to get a
better on the target always I had the track
hand right on it while it moved rapidly
away from me. The radar set was in
good working order as I practiced at intercepts
on the other fighter with warning to jumpoff.

I have 5.60 bars in the F-94, 930 or total
time. I believed at the time that this incident
was peculiar and worthy of calling to
some one's attention so as I say I had never
before seen such rapid target movement any
from an aircraft going almost 300 mph in
the same general direction.
