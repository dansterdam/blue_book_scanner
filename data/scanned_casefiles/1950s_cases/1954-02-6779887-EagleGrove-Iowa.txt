SUMMARY (State basic narrative of report, conclusions, and recommendations paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Refer to AF Form 164a)

SUMMARY: An unidentified object was reported thru the Des Moines Filter Center to D/L, 31st Air Division (Defense) on the night of 7 April, 1954. The sighting took place NORTHWEST of WEBSTER CITY, IOWA - GISEP JFM 1129 for a period of 15-20 minutes beginning about 0130, 8 April and again at 0520, 8 April (1230 CST 7 April and 2220 CST 7 April). Object was observed by one (1) SOURCE, a civilian.

Object was reported to be moving slowly in the sky in an unknown altitude with a normal speed. Object appeared in the form of a bright light, flashing and changing color from white thru red, blue, yellow, and green. Object appeared to SOURCE to be ranging in size from the size of a silver dollar to the size of a grapefruit held out at arms length. Object did not have any particular movement. SOURCE indicates a circular movement and a slow movement toward horizon after which object disappeared from sight.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The reliability of the SOURCE can be considered FAIR. SOURCE is a policeman, employed by WEBSTER CITY, IOWA government. SOURCE claims that he has viewed the object about 15-17 times, starting in December 1953. Object has appeared in the night sky every time, in the NORTHWEST quadrant beyond WEBSTER CITY, IOWA except one (1) time when it was observed in the NORTHEAST quadrant. SOURCE has reported only three (3) of the sightings to Air Force authorities. Each time object has been sighted, the weather was clear and the night sky cloudless with good visibility.

DES MOINES FILTER CENTER-- DES MOINES, IOWA

Major Strout, Commander reported no other sightings had been called into the Center on 7 April 1954.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF PREPARING OFFICER: In view of the fact that this particular SOURCE has viewed this object with regularity and the object has been seen by other individuals as well, it is suggested that all Ground Observer Posts (GOC) in the WEBSTER CITY area (20-40 mile radius) be alerted to watch for the object. The basis for this recommendation lies in the fact that in February, the object was sighted on the 14th, 5th, 15th, 17th, 27th and 28th. According to the SOURCE the object appeared with the same regularity in March although no record of the dates or times of sightings was kept by the SOURCE.
