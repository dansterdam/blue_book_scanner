PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS SIGHTING INDICATES THAT IT WAS
PROBABLY A METEOR. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT AS GIVEN BY THE
TWO OBSERVERS SEEMS TO CONFIRM THIS ESTIMATE. HOWEVER, IT IS
WITHIN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY THAT THIS OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN
AN EARTH SATELLITE.

TE VEHICLE. THERE IS, HOWEVER NO MEANS OF CONT-US
DETERMINING THIS LATTER POSSIBILITY.
