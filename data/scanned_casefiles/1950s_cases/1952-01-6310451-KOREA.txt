Following report is quoted in entirety from FEAF Bomber Command Daily Summary for 30 January 1952 and covering operations during the night of 29 - 30 January. At[time] one unidentified object was observed by the G/C, left scanner and tail gunner of aircraft No. 7232 at[time]. The disc shaped object, size estimated by observers as 3 ft. across, was first observed parallel on course, at 8 o'clock level, a distance from B-29 unknown. This object remained with the B-29 for approximately five minutes. The object appeared at 8 o'clock level going away from 29. B-29 was at 22,500 ft., heading 274°, 148 knot ground speed.

At[time] one disc shaped was observed by the left and tail gunners of aircraft 7224, at[time]. The unidentified object was observed shortly before receiving flak. The object approached the 29 from between 8 and 9 o'clock level then withdrew and disappeared at the same clock position.

The observers estimated the object to be approximately three feet across when at its nearest point to the B-29. The object was observed for one minute at which time the weather was CAVU. The object appeared to be spinning and a color resembling the sun.

Comments by 98 Bomb Wing Intelligence Officer:

Because of the unusual nature of this sighting as well as the similar one reported above special effort was made to eliminate all possible known alternatives concerning the possibility that this could have been a plexiglass reflection. It is to be noted that two different crew members spotted the object from different positions at the same time. In regard to flak, flares, and rockets, crew members indicated their familiarity with such objects.

In all cases crew members were veterans of WW II combat crewmen, and had several combat missions in Korea. They stated very emphatically that the sightings noted above bore no resemblance whatsoever to anything they had previously experienced. The possibility that such stories had been fabricated is believed to be obviated by the fact that the crews involved, from different squadrons, flew on different missions and were interrogated at widely separate times (1 hour). In conclusion it is the opinion of this officer that these sightings represent another example of new technique and warfare under test by the enemy.

Comment by D/T, FEAF Bomber Command:

It is assumed that there is still a real possibility that these phenomenon may very well indicate the presence of new enemy flare devices, despite the unit intelligence officer's feelings that such possibilities are ruled out. Aside from that, it is worth mentioning that the 98th Wing Commander was present during the interrogation, and warned the crew members as to their responsibilities in reporting such observations. Special report of unidentified flying objects will be submitted.

View of utterback of similar observations in the past and no firm indications on which to base evaluation requests your comments in regard to above.

Subj is report on info on unidentified flying objects: (1) Observed 1 globe shaped
object with a slight beam drop effect noted in lower side. Estimated size to be 3
feet across when at its nearest point to B-29. The size was not definitely established
as the distance from the observer was not known. The color of the object was white as
the sun, a light orange, and it occasionally changed to a bluish tint. The outer edge
of the object appeared to be filmy and it seemed to have an internal churning movement
like flames of fiery gases when it was at its nearest point to B-29. The object was
first observed parallel on course at 8 o'clock level, where it seemed to be about the
size of a saucer, gradually becoming larger as it approached the B-29. It came in on
the same level as the B-29 and remained in the same relative position to the B-29 for
approximately 1 min and then receded on the same path, fading away in the distance.

(2) Sighted on Jan 29 13 242 for a period of approximately 1 min. (3) The left gunner
and tail gunner observed the object without the use of any optical or electronic equipment. The B-29 was at 22,524 feet and ground speed 125 knots. (4) The 2 observers were
airborne on the B-29 in the crew positions of left gunner and tail gunner. Object
was observed at 10 5/69 and level with the B-29. (5) The observers are veterans of
over 2 combat and have flown several combat missions over Korea and are thoroughly familiar with flak, planes and rockets. The observers state very emphatically
that the object observed bore no resemblance whatsoever to anything they had previously seen. This sighting is almost the same as sighting reported in JCS 3619. This
report came from a different squadron and interrogation was conducted at different
times.

APPENDIX III

Korea - 29 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On the night of 29 January 1952, 30 miles WSW of Wonson, Korea, three members of a B-29 crew, the tail, left, and top gunner, observed a light orange colored sphere for a period of five minutes. The object was on a parallel course to the B-29 at 8 o'clock level. The color of the object was further described as being the color of the sun with an occasional bluish tint. The outer edge of the object appeared to be fuzzy and it seemed to have an internal churning movement like flames or fiery gases. The object closed in on the B-29 to an undetermined distance, and then faded away in the distance.

The aircraft was on a heading of 274°, was at 22,500 ft. altitude and was making a ground speed of 148 knots. The time of the sighting was 2300 local Korean time. The weather was CAVU.

At 2324 local Korean time, members of another B-29 crew observed an identical object near Sunchon. This object was observed for one minute. The observers were the left and tail gunners. In this instance, the B-29 was at 22,250 ft.

The sources of these reports are all World War II veterans and veterans of previous combat missions in Korea. The crews were from different squadrons and were interrogated separately.

II. DISCUSSION OF THE INCIDENT

The times that the object or objects followed the B-29's indicates that the objects were propelled by some means, which eliminates the possibility of an unguided ground-to-air missile, drop missiles, etc. The color and shape of the flame were studied by members of the ATIC Propulsion Group to determine whether or not the plane could have been the exhaust of a conventional jet engine with or without an afterburner, a pulse-jet, ram-jet, or rocket engine. None of these possibilities were considered to be applicable.

The report is somewhat similar to the reports of "fireball-fighters", a type of phenomena observed in Europe during World War II. The exact nature of this phenomena was never determined but bomber crews reported large fiery balls, similar to the sun, passing through or near their formations. More is no documented evidence or data available on this phenomena, and the information that has been obtained is verbal from World War II bomber crewmen, consequently, few actual facts are available.

2. Since the objects followed the aircraft for times of one minute and five minutes, it can be safely assumed that they were propelled (i.e., not soaring or free-air missiles). Therefore, it is requested that the shape and color of the reported flare be analyzed for the possibility of the object being:

a. A conventional jet engine.
b. A conventional jet engine with an afterburner.

1. A review has been made of descriptive material regarding the observations made on the night of 29 January 1952 by members of B-29 crews of globe-like fiery objects flying courses similar to friendly aircraft for short durations.

2. This group concurs that the objects appear to be propelled but from the descriptions and the time directions cited it is not considered that the objects are conventional jet engines, conventional jet engine with afterburner, pulsed, or rocket propelled. Slight credence, however, is given to the possibility of a ramjet powered helicopter or a modification thereof, with provisions incorporated for exhausting along a section of the trailing edge of the rotors blade, creating the fuzzy edged, internal churning of flames and gases, globe shaped phenomena observed recently by the B-29 crews in Korea.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC RELATIONS

SUBJECT: (Unclassified) Unidentified Objects Sighted by ----3 G. S.
Crew Korea During the Night of 27-30 January 1952.

1. This branch has been queried with regard to the above sightings. Specifically we have been requested to release additional information concerning sightings and evaluation of intelligence. The information below is presented in the hopes that it will clarify the situation and assist to elucidate the big play given this incident in the nation's press.

2. The sightings mentioned, although of a different nature, are as usual, were not abnormal occurrences in the combat theatre. During World War II, Germany and Japan, combat crews reported all sightings of multiple objects (Xmas trees or many lights) which could not be readily explained. Those were often were reported as "Fireballs", particularly from combat crewmen participating in flights over Korea. Many of these sightings of disintegrated objects, particularly in flight, were very low speeds to the point of hovering, followed or preceded by a trail of sparks, etc. Intelligence was never able to prove the existence of such unconventional phenomena nor was it able to determine the significance of these sightings. But it is clear that evaluation of all such sighted incidents was made essentially as follows:

a. The sightings were the result of natural normal occurrences while in combat, e.g., flak, flaring and explosive charges, reflection on clouds, searchlight reflections, white exhaust trails, air-to-air bombs, etc., and sometimes a result of combat fatigue, particularly on the long missions required to bomb Japan.

3. There have been numerous reports of objects with crews during the combat over Korea while the combat was actively in progress. In general, these sightings have occurred in a pattern which parallels the overall pattern of World War II reports. The latest reports from Korea suggest a conventional aircraft, possibly attached to some conventional aircraft and used in reconnaissance with or without a crew of 1-3 pilots. This conclusion is based on the thin type of object probably on such airborne sweepstakes.

which because of combat fatigue, conditions of sighting, weather factors,
etc., were assumed to in objected to anything else. Such a
report would appear reasonable in view of the fact that an object of this
type would naturally become a center of interest, so to speak, and would
tend to cause the observer to concentrate on its details rather than to
look for anything else in conjunction with it.

4. A detailed investigation of such sighting is being conducted
by ATIC. Thus far they have requested additional specific information
from FEAF and pending the receipt of the reply to the request they cannot
so a report with clarification. As soon as the routine additional
details this information will be made known through routine installation
channels.

1. The following information is submitted upon which to base a reply to Senator Russell:

a. The incident referred to in Senator Russell's letter occurred on the night 29-30 Jan 52. Two different B-29's of FSAF 50X601 reported sighting an object which was described as follows:

(1) Globe-shaped with slight taper from offset on lower side. Color reddish-tan (light orange) and occasionally changing; to a bluish tint. Seemed to have internal churning movement like flakes or fiery mass when at nearest point to B-29. (The original report stated that the object was 5 miles distant). One B-29 observed the object for five minutes while the second B-29 at a different location and 24 minutes later observed a similar object for one minute. Although the size was estimated at three feet in diameter, in both cases, the distance of the object (See next page)

from the B-29's could not be determined. The second aircraft received flak shortly after sighting the object. Crew members w'o reported the sighting were in both case experienced combat crew men, having had experience over Germany in World War II as well as previous experience in the Korean theater.

b. The press release referred to by Senator Russell actually contains a mixture of the information given in the preliminary PIAF report plus that contained in their detail a report, which was submitted a subsequent to the "flying saucer" aspects of the incident based upon the initial description of "disk-shape."

c. ATIC requested PIAF to furnish additional particulars, if available, following receipt of the preliminary reports. Additionally, they requested that PIAF alert their bomber crews to the possibility of such sightings in the future where upon they would utilize fire control equipment in an effort to determine the distance of such objects from the observing aircraft. Thus far, there have been no additional reports from PIAF of similar sightings, and neither ATIC nor AFOIN-V to have arrived at a final evaluation of this incident.

d. Based on the meager information thus far available, it is possible to arrive at only tentative evaluations of what the objects may have been. Two possible evaluations follow:

(1) Observation of the exhaust from an La-9 or La-11 Soviet flight or aircraft. The exhaust stacks on both these single-engine aircraft are arranged in a cluster on each side of the fuselage, and it is believed that the exhaust emanating from this installation, when seen at night, would give an illusion such as described in the reports received.

(2) There have been several reports in the last few months of search-lights attached to Jet and rail patrol conventional aircraft which have intercepted PIAF bombers over Korea. These identifications have been stated to be positive in most instances. The one such occurrence, a probable conventional aircraft on a very dark night would be a second possible explanation of the above incidents, since the attention of the crew would probably be focused on the light source and this fact coupled with the difficulty of discerning an aircraft silhouette, under extremely poor light conditions, could conceivably account for a report of this nature.

OBSERVATION: Reference Marine pilot observation of balloons in Korean area reported FEAF Intsun 651, 8 Apr 52, this hqs has received no previous report of the sighting or use of such balloons. An F-4, report recently received (w/1 5 AF, IR-17-52, 6 Mar 52) stated that "Globe-shaped-orange-colored object" recently reported sighted by UN aircraft were in reality a type of WWII Japanese balloon to be elevated to frighten UN planes from areas, and were being manufactured in Manchuria. One possible explanation of the presently reported sightings, if accurately described, could be that the enemy is experimenting with a new defense measure against low-level UN interdiction efforts. However, the size of the balloons (10-15 ft. in diameter) would seem to preclude any great altitude capability.

III. CONCLUSIONS

No conclusions have been reached as to the identity or origin of these unidentified aerial objects. One possibility is that this may have been some type of flare towed by an aircraft to mark the B-29 for flak crews. No aircraft exhaust flare was reported, however.

APPENDIX III
Korea - 29 January 1952

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT

On the night of 29 January 1952 at 2300 and again at 2324, local Korea time, two B-29 crews at different locations observed similar objects near their aircraft. They described them as a disk, approximately three feet in diameter, and with a color similar to the sun. In one instance the object stayed beside the B-29 for five minutes and in the other for one minute.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION

More details on this incident have been requested.
