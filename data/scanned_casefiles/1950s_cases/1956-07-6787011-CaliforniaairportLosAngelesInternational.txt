Here is the text I can read from the document:

"IN"

"ACTION"

"20 JUL 1956 14 - 58"

"134E4"
"3-4x20"
"4c"

"MULTI"

The rest of the document appears to be mostly blank with some faint dots or lines, but no legible text.


- page 2 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible. There appears to be a large black redaction or blacked-out section on the left side of the document, and the rest of the page contains faint dots and very blurry text that cannot be clearly read.
