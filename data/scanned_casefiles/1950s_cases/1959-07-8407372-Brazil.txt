FAB receberá relatorio 
sobre «Discos Voadores»

Tendo a Escola Técnica do Exército, estado elaborando um relatorio sobre os "discos voadores", que tém sido observados em várias partes do pais, a Fôrça Aérea Brasileira (FAB) receberá êsse relatorio a fim de estudar o assunto.

O objeto luminoso 

Segundo informações, que se dizem fidedignas, o objeto luminoso que voava a grande velocidade, e que fôra observado por muitas pessoas em várias cidades da região, apresenta-se como um "disco voador".

As características dêsse objeto, segundo os observadores, sào as seguintes:

1) Brilhante, intenso, azul-esverdeado, e de forma circular ou oval, medindo aproximadamente 6 a 8 metros de diâmetro.

2) Voava a grande velocidade, dando saltos e mudanças bruscas de trajetória, ora subindo verticalmente, ora descendo em plano inclinado, ora voando horizontalmente.

3) Fazia um barulho semelhante ao de um "jato" em vôo rasante. 

4) Fõra visto por várias pessoas, em diversas localidades, desde a tarde ate meia-noite.

Essas foram, em síntese, as informações colhidas pela Escola Técnica do Exército, que está elaborando um relatório sóbre o assunto a ser enviado à FAB.

THE AIR FORCE WILL RECEIVE A REPORT ON THE "FLYING DISK" 
NO. 15 (TR) The astronomer, as well as Captain Eilio Vaz of the Technical School of the Army, confirm the report to send the Brazilian Air Force. They present details about the phenomenon as witnessed on totally night.  
The luminous object which moved across the Carioca (Rio de Janeiro) sky was observed also by the Observatory of Valongo by the soldier __________ and the Military Police, and by the General __________ __________. From various districts off ho city dwellers said that they also saw the "disk." 
THE LUMINOUS OBJECT 
The astronomer and professor of the National Faculty of Philosophy, __________ __________, excludes that our reporting an illusion.
The object presented itself in the field of the binocular with the aspect of a disk with a central protuberance in the central part and a set of green light as it appeared, forming optically what seemed to be a cross with six points of green light. The object could not, by its characteristics and movement, be confused with any known celestial body.
The astronomer told us that the shape of the object had a metallic aspect and the set of green lights was similar to the navigation lights as installed on airplanes. The disk was dark colored; its diameter was estimated at 10-15 meters, going out from its extremity, giving the impression to assume the naked eye that it was divided into two parts.
The astronomers were unable to affirm that the object would be at a distance of an more than 30 kilometers from the earth.

Text from the document:

ASTRONOMOS DO RIO VIRAM DISCO-VOADOR

Pela primeira vez no mundo o estranho fenomeno e avistado por um observador, cuja profissao e determinar a veracidade dos fatos. Devido a sua seriedade, uma ocorrencia desta natureza nao pode passar despercebida ou ser tratada com leviandade.

Sao Paulo, 13 (TA) - Tres astronomos do Observatorio Nacional, no Rio de Janeiro, observaram ontem um disco voador. Essa observacao foi feita as 18 horas e 10 minutos aproximadamente, quando os astronomos observavam o planeta Venus atraves de um telescopio de grande abertura. 

De acordo com a informacao oficial de um dos observadores, os astronomos Maria Fernanda Dias e Alberto Villa-Boas, durante a observacao do planeta Venus, observaram a cerca de 100 metros de distancia do telescopio, um objeto de forma circular, que se deslocava rapidamente no espaco.

Esse fenomeno, segundo a mesma informacao, so pode ser classificado com certeza como um disco-voador, visto que apresentava todas as caracteristicas observadas em outras oportunidades por testemunhas avulsas.

A OBSERVACAO OFICIAL

De acordo com a observacao oficial feita pelos astronomos do Observatorio Nacional, o objeto era de forma circular ou eliptica, com cerca de 10 metros de diametro, avistado a cerca de 100 metros de distancia do telescopio e com velocidade estimada em cerca de 1.200 quilometros por hora. 

Foram feitas fotografias, porem ainda nao foram reveladas, nem mesmo aos proprios observadores.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of a "flying disk" by astronomers from the University of Brazil. The document includes details about the size, movement, and appearance of the object, as well as the reactions and observations of the astronomers who witnessed it.

OBSERVATION OF RIO SAW FLYING DISK

For the first time in the world the strange phenomenon is seen by an observatory. Astronomers guarantee that at no mistake would be impossible. 

It was twice as large as the planet Venus and could be seen by the naked eye.

Rio, 14 (AP) Three astronomers of the observatory of the University of Brazil watched through a telescope an object flying at an elevation of from 10:10 to 10:30 p.m. The trajectory of a flying disk at the elevation of the 8llls contaming the motion moving toward the austral triangle and the Southern Cross until it disappeared in the haze of the horizon. The public statement was made by Professor Luis Gaheia of the National Faculty of Philosophy, and he has added that the astronomers and Captain (redacted) of the Nautical School of the Army supported him.

CORRECTION

"I have no doubt whatever but that it was a flying disk," said Professor (redacted). "We are used to making these observations and we would not confound the apparatus with any celestial body, balloon, sonde, or interplanetary rocket."

Very excited, the Professor said that the disk traversed 110 degrees in 23 minutes, but he was not able to calculate the linear velocity because at that hour their measuring instruments had been put away.

After confirming Luis's declarations, Captain Sire added that the flying disk could be seen by the naked eye and that its size was that of the planet Venus and not twinkling like that of the stars.

OFFICIAL OBSERVATION
The press gives prominent place to the announcement of this strange phenemen. it Is worth mentioning that this is the first time in the world that a flying disk has been seen by an observatory. However, the speed with which it traversed the trajectory did not allow for the taking of pictures. No traditional movement was observed in it - only a translation (forward) movement.
