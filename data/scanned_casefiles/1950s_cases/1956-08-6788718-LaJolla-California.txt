[Partially illegible text at the top of the document]

h. 18th was [rest of line illegible] report of unidentified flying object as seen by [illegible] civilian, La Jolla, California, on 6 August 1956 in the general vicinity of La Jolla Shores, California.

eye can see, he observed what appeared to be two jet aircraft flying in a descending pattern with trailing vapor trails. As to the apparent descent of the aircraft, he could not determine whether they were proceeding toward or away from him, such direction being either north-northwest or south-southeast, as the case might be.

While observing the aircraft, he noticed an unidentified object which crossed the vapor trail of one of the aircraft. Immediately thereafter the object made a 90 degree turn, heading approximately north at an exceptional rate of speed. The object, as described, was elliptical in shape and of a silvery metallic color. When making the 90 degree turn northward, the object appeared to take on a bluish glow.

Relative to the size of the object, he could only say that when compared (relatively) to the size of the jet aircraft which appeared as pinpoints, the object had a relatively large size. He further stated that the object appeared to be traveling much faster than the jet aircraft, and disappeared from view almost instantaneously after making the 90 degree turn.

4. [Partially redacted name], age 42, occupation, housewife, and sculptress, addressed her husband's statement with only minor variations. She stated to the effect that the jet aircraft were noted and the unidentified object was traveling at a much higher rate of speed and disappeared from view almost instantly. However, the object was traveling at such a high rate of speed as to defy far vehicle.

5. [Partially redacted name], an architectural assistant, stated that the object was for a relatively short period of time in view, and that he could offer no further elaboration. However, he stated that the object appeared to move out of its exact shape. In addition, he said that the object appeared to give off a reddish light. He was very cautious as to him possibility of its being a foreign object or "flying saucer," as he voiced it.

6. [Partially redacted text] were very positive that the object could not have been a meteor, balloon, or any type of aircraft commonly sighted in this area.
