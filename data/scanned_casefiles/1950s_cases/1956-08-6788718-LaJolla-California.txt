SUMMARY: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. On 6 August 1956, at approximately 1:45 hours, a civilian observed a jet aircraft like object traveling at a high rate of speed in the La Jolla area. The object appeared to have three white lights and was observed for approximately 10 seconds before it disappeared from view. The civilian attempted to track the object with his automobile but was unable to follow it due to the high speed at which it was traveling.

2. On 7 August 1956, the civilian was interviewed and stated that the object appeared to be traveling at an estimated speed of 1,800 to 2,000 miles per hour. The object was observed for approximately 10 seconds and disappeared in a westerly direction leaving no trace. The civilian stated that the object made no sound and left no vapor trail.
