"SPACE MISSILES BLOW UP AND DISAPPEARED OVER TEXAS: Two jet fighters taking off from an unnamed Texas air base engaged what appeared to be two Bomarc missiles shortly before dawn but watch radar lost track of both at the same time a tremendous explosion was observed several miles away. 
The Air Force confirmed both fighters had attempted to intercept a pair of unidentified high speed targets closing on the base, but that the targets had suddenly disappeared from the radar screen and then apparently blown up. An intensive search of the area located no trace of wreckage or debris.
Earlier, several witnesses in the vicinity had reported seeing a bright orange object streak across the sky followed by a bright flash and then the object's sudden disappearance. There have been several similar incidents reported at this base within the past year, all of them involving unidentified aircraft or objects disappearing under mysterious circumstances."
