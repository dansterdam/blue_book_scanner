The image contains a photograph of a child's painting depicting the bright Kansas Oklahoma fireball of 17 December 1955. The image shows a bright object in the sky surrounded by a fiery trail. The text below the image describes the fireball as "as bright as day" and mentions that the fireball is of interest to the public and scientific community for fireball study.

Text from the document:

Today scientists at the RAND Corporation are tackling an unsolved mystery that has been bothering astronomers for 150 years. The mystery is about reports that when giant meteors flash across the sky there are noises - a buzzing, hissing sound. Could this be a problem. Certainly one of these big meteors flashing across the sky almost as bright as the sun itself must sweep up a gigantic sound. This very speed of their passage may explain the hissing sound reported by many eyewitnesses. 

But It Can't Happen!
Just the same there is a violation of physics in the reports that say you can see the fireball and hear the sound at the same time. The common part of these reports is that the sound is heard at exactly the same time the fireball is seen. 

If you have ever seen a bright fireball - and by that we mean one that lights the night sky up as bright as day - you will know that it is at least 100 miles away. The speed of light is 186,000 miles a second. And the speed of sound is only about 1/5 of a mile per second. So the time lag between seeing the fireball and hearing the sound should be the time it takes the sound to travel from where the fireball was to where you are. This would be about 3 minutes.

Thus, because of what was known about the speed of sound, most scientists rejected these reports of hearing sound at the same time the fireball was seen. 

Trying to Solve It
Today's scientists think that the reports may be genuine. If so, the sound must be traveling at a much faster speed than normal. How can a fireball produce a sound that travels 100 times as fast as ordinary sound? The answer may be in some electromagnetic radiation effects. The tremendous heat of the fireball may ionize the air, creating an electrical charge that can send out a pulse through the atmosphere.

If you have ever seen a bright fireball - and by that we mean one that lights the night sky up as bright as day - you will know that it is at least 100 miles away. The speed of light is 186,000 miles a second. And the speed of sound is only about 1/5 of a mile per second. So the time lag between seeing the fireball and hearing the sound should be the time it takes the sound to travel from where the fireball was to where you are. This would be about 3 minutes.

If this is the case, it will give scientists some specific problems to experiment with:
1. How can a fireball send out electromagnetic waves that travel much faster than sound?
2. How can these waves be detected and measured?
Perhaps it's electricity. There is much evidence to suggest that meteors do send out electromagnetic waves of some kind. In 1938, in Madrid, Spain, the city electric lights were put out for a short time by the passage of a fireball. The Schyolte-Aline (Russia) meteor of 1947 produced currents in a disconnected telephone wire. It was enough current to give the repairmen a shock.

A few observers have reported fluctuations of the compass needle during meteor showers and during meteor passage. Meteors are sometimes heard as static on ordinary radios, and Canadians physicists have shown that some bright fireballs give off radio waves.

If you have any information to the scientists who are working on this problem, Address your letter to Dr. Donald H. Menzel, RAND Corporation, 1700 Main Street, Santa Monica, California 90406.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a hand-drawn illustration and accompanying text.

The text reads as follows:

Most people know that you see and hear a high-flying jet plane at different spots in the sky. This is because sound travels so much slower than does light. However, some people report a "thump" or "other sound" that seems to come directly from the jet. This may be related to meteors sent out a signal over and above the radar that was trained on them. There seems enough evidence to suspect that meteors may send out electromagnetic signals.

Closing in
If these signals do reach the observer in the next problem is how do they get changed into sound? 

For about a quarter of a century, scientists said this "radio" waves from the meteor were changed into sound by non-linear rectification. This simply means that objects near the observer, something acted as a natural radio receiver. These would work much like the old fashioned crystal sets.

Any metal object which is excited by an outside layer may convert radio frequencies to sound frequencies. The galena crystal worked like this. Today we know the same job. A man standing near an old model, rusty, untunable would have better luck than a man in a new car, according to this theory.

Thus, we have a pattern. A sudden, startling ignition in the atmosphere caused by shock waves and the speeding light waves. Both then reach the observer together, regardless of the distances involved. 

Some metal object, near the observer, changes the radio to sound.

This is the older theory. It's a little hard to confirm with controlled experiment. Fireballs do not come on schedule.

Another electrical, and very different hypothesis is based on the fact that the electrical charge in the earth's atmosphere is negative in relation to a gigantic electrical condenser.

Biological Answers
More recently, and more imaginatively, the latest theory is that the electromagnetic radiation from the fireball is picked up by living tissue within the body of the observer.

Experiments in the last couple of years have shown conclusively that radiation at radio frequencies can be registered at the head of the observer. The mechanism of the process is still largely unknown.

But much more data is needed, and RAND scientists are seeking to have it available. They want to hear from any observer who has had such an experience. If you know of such a person, send the date to the address given in the box on our previous page. Do not send it to RAND. Consulting Scientists are especially interested in experiences of Children. There is some evidence that they may be better observers than their parents. Get busy now.
