as well that its form seemed to be perfectly round (i.e. seemingly
too symmetrical for a meteor.

speed has long bothered me. At one time I be-
lieved it may well have been at much greater altitude.
My original impression was that it was just over the
tree tops and that someone might have belatedly been
indulging in firing rockets ( Fourth July only a month
away) but this was an isolated and uninhabited stretch
of road near midnight and the object's flight path
was brief and then witnessed having a steady gain 
at altitude and then none of the sounds one would
expect - neither the exhaust or rumbling sounds of an 
aircraft - no sound whatsoever. Would say my speed
estimation were correct then altitude estimation
on this later occasion need not to be that the object
came back to me or my approach as was first assumed
over the tree tops; if it certainly could not have been at

and shooting stars (one which was seen immediately
after the passing of this object - and which was very
distant in the foreground) not only did it seem to 
be at lower altitude, the feet the reddish sphere was

distinct seems to support this conclusion, otherwise the sphere must have been of enormous size if at any great height so that the sphere would have appeared as distinct as it seemed. Further, having seen quite a few "shooting stars" – most from start to finish (as the one seen immediately after the passage of the "fireball object") and all to their "finish", this green fire ball was not seen from start to finish, for it came into sight and was lost to sight because the view was obstructed to see if it crashed – wood buildings. trees.

Additional note to Question 40: 

If the following problem can be solved, being 
a reasonable cloud upon the object's speed and 
altitude is possible. I have been searching for 
some means by which these could be determined -- Do 
you know his herein if a value can be assigned to 
the intensity of the object's light? At several or 
so often I became aware of a light overhead 
the object came into view (duration seen, answered 
in question 5). Problem, how far could the object's 
glow be evident to be noticeable under the cir-
cumstances this object was seen? What intensity 
was its light when the object was distributionary 
to when the size approximately of a "grapefruit".
What then was the object's size? If these can 
be solved, then it will be possible to solve fairly 
definitely the object's altitude as well as 
speed since we have a) duration seen, b) angle 
of view, and, c) object's declination; as well,
d) true extent of the object's glow radius(sphere). 
It has had me licked -- would you let 
me know results if above can be solved? -- 
It'd really be interested!!

"B" Glow from unseen object first became visible.

"C" Unknown position of object at moment its glow became visible. 

"D" Unknown radius of the object's "glow". Presumably not lower than this over the trees since object’s glow did not light up foliage on trees as it approached nearer, i.e., had to pass below (D.E.) and sweep in towards observer due to closeness of approach, that is, went to infinity straight up the page as it passed. 

"E" Volume of object itself became visible about a second after its glow was first noted.

"F" End of object's visible flight of 3-5 seconds duration and being of unknown altitude and speed. Object's declination about 30° from zenith.

Dec. 4, 1953

Sir;

Subject: "Flying Saucers"

While P.E. Kaylor's book, Flying Saucers from
Outer Space, lists in his appendix, a "Form A, U.S.
Air Force Technical Information Sheet" I wish to
request a copy of this form.

Do not claim to have seen a "Flying Saucer"
but if you are interested will report a fireball,
seen in broad light in the Adirondacks
some time ago. Inquiry regarding same
was made at the time to the Hayden
Planetarium - they had no report at the
time of fireballs. Thought it meteoric.
Was seen near midnight wouldn't venture
guess as to its altitude but wouldn't say
it was at great altitude. Will fill out
your form to best of my ability.
Air Force can evaluate it, I have no opinion,
will report only what I saw.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

MEMO FOR Captain Hardin

Would you please send this man a questionnaire? I have made no reply to his letter.

Thanks

Lt White

We do not know of any special meteor which was seen on the date you mention, but records of these do not appear until later, in the magazines.

It might have been an ordinary airplane, perhaps; we cannot tell as well as you. There were no special meteor showers due on that date, but very often there are "spurious" meteors, that is, those not belonging to any particular shower, which fall and are seen, singly. Some of them are slowly moving objects; others move fast. We have seen them of the color you mention. We would mention that the height and distance, as witnessed, are quite deceptive; the objects are usually farther away than supposed.

The image you have provided appears to be page 3 of a historical document, possibly from Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. The page contains a hand-drawn illustration of an object and handwritten descriptions.

The illustration displays a roughly elliptical shape with a dark central area and a streak behind it, as if indicating motion or trailing light. There are notes indicating "Foreway part of a brighter red" at the front part of the object, and an arrow labeled "DIRECTION."

Below is the transcription of the text found in the document:

---

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.

a. Sound in the silent night of the quiet forest a absolutely no sound heard.
b. Color Spherical reddish object partly obscured by irivid green light which surrounded it and streamed behind its. No diming nor brighting seen.

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing, to show the direction the object was moving.
Some flickering of light seemed confined to tail which fades out.

DIRECTION

Foreway part of a brighter red.

LENGTH 2.6 TO 3X ITS WIDTH,APPRX. 
NOTE: This sketch not correctly to a to distance.

DURING THE INTERVAL SEEN, THE LIGHT WAS STEADY AND CONSTANT.

18. The edges of the object were: However, The general Spherical Form was fairly distinct.
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred.  b. Like a bright star  c. Sharply outlined  d. Don't remember     Other ___

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Only one seen.
Draw a picture of how they are arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

--- 

The text provides a witness account regarding the sound, color, and shape of the observed object, and includes specific observations such as the absence of sound, the reddish color with green light, and the object's general appearance and movement. The responses indicate that the object had a steady and constant light, that it had a generally spherical form, and that only one object was seen.

   b. Fairly certain                 d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? lost to view due to trees.
______________________________________________________________

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Can only say that it appeared to be a sphere and of a solid nature. And say sphere since in observing its approach and departure it did not change shape throughout such change of view as was permitted by the angle of view and the objects declination in it.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

Not more than
30° from the
zenith.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

Angle of
opening
60°

Surrounded by trees, angle of view 
probably not more than 60°.
