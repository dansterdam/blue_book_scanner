Case IV 52

Rr 00 Em

Dear Mr.[ REDACTED ] 
Here is the information on the case in question (F.I.O.) concerning the UFO sighting. The right date of the incident was July 7. On that night, Mrs.[ REDACTED ] reported seeing the object hovering over the area for at least 15 minutes. Additionally, some other communcations were received on this incident, but the identity of the observers is withheld.

Transcription of the text:

"I mean to be completely frank and honest in my report to you concerning the incidents which occurred at this site on the night of 6 July 1952. What I observed was certainly no ordinary aircraft, and the actions of the object only serve to deepen the mystery. My report to the intelligence officers will be a full and complete one, but I feel that I should also apprise you personally of the details. 

Namely, this: The object appeared to be circular in shape, and possessed a number of bright lights which seemed to be flashing or rotating. Its speed of movement was truly astonishing, and the maneuvers it executed were quite beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. I cannot even begin to estimate its altitude, but it was certainly at a considerable height. The duration of the sighting was approximately 15 minutes, and during that time the object carried out a number of very erratic and extraordinary gyrations, first hovering, then accelerating with incredible speed, and then abruptly altering course. I must confess that I am at a complete loss to account for what I observed, and I can only surmise that it was some type of unconventional aerial vehicle of unknown origin. I should be most interested to learn if others have reported similar incidents, and would appreciate any light you can shed on this puzzling occurrence.

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]"

TRANSCRIPT:

saw this light to descend
around 1952 to 1953. It
slowly started moving away and
then suddenly went straight up
at a great speed. It seemed to
be a round bright light about the
size of a basket ball. It traveled
a straight course and had no
trails or wings or anything like
that and some neighbors (whose
name I cannot read) also witnessed
it and told me they saw about the

same thing. I would not have
mentioned this except that it seemed
strange and I am curious to know
if anyone else happened to see
something like this around that time.

"may not be any form of aircraft known to this country. We are now deeply concerned with this matter and I must see action taken very promptly. I am requesting a personal interview with General Cabell or General Samford at the earliest possible date. Will you please let me know when this interview can be arranged."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document describing an "incident" involving "sighting" of "B-36s on mission with fighter escort".

According to the text, the investigating officer's conclusion is that the objects observed were the B-36s.

The full text of the document is as follows:
