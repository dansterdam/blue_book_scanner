According to the observer, the object sighted was pulsating and glowing-red in color, with the speed of a piper cub (approximately 50-85 miles per hour) and stated the altitude of the object was just about cloud level, and that it was within view for approximately one (1) to one and one-half (1 1/2) minutes, after which it disappeared towards the southeast. Further stated that the object sighted appeared to be rotating, but had no definite shape.

2.     Informed Mr. that his wife was present during this entire period of time and that following the sighting of this object he discussed the matter with a neighbor across the street from his home. The neighbor did not recall the name of this neighbor, but stated that the neighbor informed him that he had likewise seen the object in question, and described it as stated above.
