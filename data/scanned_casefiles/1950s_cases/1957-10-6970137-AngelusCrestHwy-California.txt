TO: AFCIN-14h                              FROM: Western Office, ATIC                DATE: 10 Dec 57        COMMENT NO. 1
                                                                                    Lt Col Mitchell/ck

1. Reference your message AFCIN-14h cite 12-1913-E, the following information pertaining to the hoax perpetrated recently by an individual in Van Nuys, California, is submitted.

Mr. [redacted], an employee of Bendix Radio, Van Nuys, California, reported to his supervisor at Bendix to display a "finned missile like" object he had obtained locally found in the mountains near Angeles Crest Highway. The supervisor placed the object in the hands of Bendix police, who in turn released it to Van Nuys police.

At this point the Air Force Office of Public Information was called to aid in identification of the object. The Western Office, ATIC was requested by AF PIO to assist. The object was easily identified as being locally built and ATIC was so informed.

Unfortunately, a vast amount of publicity accompanied the series of events; publicity, which Mr. [redacted] did not relish, since it was later determined that he got out of hand in view of the mounting publicity. He became concerned about "how things would play out" and intended to play on his supervisor. He intended that it end there.

Air Force PIO, Hollywood, promised Mr. [redacted] not to repeat not to release the details presented above since the individual concerned would probably suffer loss of his job or other possible embarrassment. This office felt obligated to comply with their request.

The object has been shipped to ATIC, Attention: Major Smith, AFCIN-14A.

The text I can see in this image is:

ID 2

92

The image appears to be a technical drawing or schematic of a rocket or missile-like object, drawn in black and white, with a pointed nose cone, a central vertical support structure, and a wide triangular base.


- page 7 -

Text found in the image:

Russia 1
2 Mar 61

The image shows a black and white photograph of what appears to be a technical drawing or schematic of an aircraft or spacecraft with a circular central section and angular wing-like structures. The drawing is somewhat blurry and has a grainy, vintage appearance typical of mid-20th century technical illustrations.

[Most of the text is partially illegible due to poor image quality and scanning. Only fragments of words and lines can be discerned. The text appears to be a typewritten document with some words and phrases visible, but not enough to confidently reconstruct the full text.]

The bottom of the page contains a partially visible line that reads: "were hidden by the paint."


- page 9 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph or illustration showing what seems to be hands holding or manipulating some kind of tool or instrument, possibly pliers or a similar mechanical device. The image has a grainy, high-contrast appearance typical of older photographic or documentary materials.
