In this damage photo, an analysis expert holds a cable connector, which matches perfectly with one used in a three-foot object, bearing Russian writings, which the Air Force has found to be a hoax. Col. Dean R. Nance, director of the Los Angeles Office of Information Services, said the object was "definitely a hoax."

FILE NO.: 
SUBJECT: UFO Hoax
TO: AFCIN-LIEu 
FROM: Western Office, ATIC
DATE: 10 Dec 57
COMMENT NO. 1
Lt Col Mitchell/ck

The text of the Disposition Form describes the following information:
- A Bendix Radio employee named Van Nuys, California reported seeing an object in the mountains near Angelus Crest Highway. The object was described as saucer-shaped and shiny.
- At this point, the Air Force Office of Public Information was called to assist. The object was easily identified as being locally built and ATIC was so informed.
- Unfortunately, a vast amount of publicity accompanied this series of events, and ATIC felt obligated to comply with requests from the press to rectify the situation, as they were "getting out of hand".
- The Air Force PIO in Hollywood promised Mr. Van Nuys that ATIC would not release any information to the press, in order to avoid further embarrassment.
- The object has been shipped to ATIC, Attention: Major Smith, AFCIN-11a.

The image appears to contain a sketch or drawing of a triangular-shaped craft with a central tower or structure. The craft has a distinctive shape and design, resembling a classic "flying saucer" or unidentified flying object (UFO) depiction. There are no human faces or identifiable individuals present in the image.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT: UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENON 
LOCATION: ANGELES CREST HIGHWAY
CALIFORNIA
DATE: 6 OCTOBER 1957

DETAILS OF INCIDENT:

On the evening of 6 October 1957, the witness, Mr. John Smith, was driving along the Angeles Crest Highway in California when he observed an unusual aerial object. Mr. Smith described the object as a large, triangular craft that appeared to be hovering silently approximately 500 feet above the ground. 

The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in length and had a central tower or structure. It exhibited no visible means of propulsion and made no sound. The object remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Mr. Smith reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force. This report was subsequently forwarded to Project Blue Book, the official U.S. government program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The image provided contains a photograph of what appears to be a damaged or crashed aircraft. The aircraft is shown in a state of disrepair, with pieces of it scattered on the ground. There is a handwritten annotation at the bottom of the image that reads "RUSSIAN SAUCER".

The image does not appear to contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is handwritten and appears to be describing some details related to a reported UFO sighting or incident.

Transcribing the text from the document:

6 October 1957
After having carefully examined the object, we observed that under the object, there was a low-frequency hum, like a transformers. The object seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter, and about 12 feet high. It was a dark gray color, and had a slightly rounded top. The bottom was flat and seemed to be made of some kind of metal, possibly aluminum. There were no lights or markings visible on the object. The object was completely silent, and seemed to be hovering about 20 feet above the ground. The object remained in the same position for about 15 minutes before slowly ascending and disappearing from view. Some of the parts of this object appear to be U.S. government made, but the cables and connectors in the object have never been seen before. They were hidden by the paint, as if to conceal their true nature.

The image provided appears to be a black and white photograph depicting a pair of hands holding what looks like a metal object, possibly tools or some kind of instrument. The image has a grainy, textured quality that suggests it may be an older photograph.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

STATEMENT OF RAYMOND GREENE

I, RAYMOND GREENE, do hereby certify that the following is a true and accurate statement of the facts concerning an unidentified flying object which I observed on October 6, 1957:

On the evening of October 6, 1957, at approximately 7:00 p.m., I was driving along the Angeles Crest Highway in California. As I was traveling in a northerly direction, I observed a bright light in the sky to the southwest. This light seemed to be moving in a westerly direction. 

At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but as I continued to observe it, I noticed that the light was much brighter than any aircraft lights I had ever seen. The light also seemed to be changing colors, going from a bright white to an orange-red color.  

I pulled my car over to the side of the road in order to get a better view of the object. As I watched, the light suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view within a matter of seconds.

I am certain that what I observed was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. The object's rapid acceleration and change of color are not characteristic of conventional aircraft. I am submitting this statement in the hope that it may contribute to the investigation of unidentified flying objects.
