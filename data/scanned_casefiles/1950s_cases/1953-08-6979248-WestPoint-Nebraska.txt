Time- Approximately 2340 on August 4, 1953 at West Point, Nebraska

Weather Conditions - Clear sky, Stars bright

Narrative - Had just shut off sprinkler system and was admiring the sky when I first visible when a moving light moving from north to west to south south east caught my eye. It was slightly brighter than the brightest star visible. It remained clearly visible at all times, until 12 degrees from the neighbors house to the south. As it passed to the South and the distance from my point of observation increased, the light decreased in intensity except for about 30 seconds. Then it was about the same when it again grew quite bright. No sound was over heard. The light was white. It appeared to be at a considerable distance away though this is only an opinion as there was nothing to gauge distance by. Any object moving at such a speed thru the sky should have given off as identifiable noise if it were close by or on the ground. If it was quite a distance the object must have been great.

This object must have been seen by others who could report it's position from other locations. It would seem that it should have been picked up on the radar scopes at the Aircraft Warning Station in Omaha. If so it may be that identification has been established.
