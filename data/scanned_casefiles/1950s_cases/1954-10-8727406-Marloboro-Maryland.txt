11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object size of baseball. Yellow, changing to red. Speed estimated at 5 mph, altitude 2-10,000 ft. No sound. Small red tail. Motion upward and to NW.

Speed of 5 mph of object this size at this altitude would be difficult to note. Some inconsistency on this point with a duration of 10 minutes. No report on manner of disappearance, however the general description and flight characteristics are in accord with a balloon observation.

At the bottom of the document, I can read the following text:

There are some other partially legible handwritten markings on the left side of the page, but they are not clear enough to confidently transcribe.

The rest of the page appears to be mostly blank or with text that is too faint or blurry to read with certainty.
