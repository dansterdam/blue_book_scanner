10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) object bright red, green, and white, light apparently in a vertical line was observed to hover and remain motionless for a few minutes and then drift slowly to the NW. Observers also stated that object appeared to have wings but could not identify obvious aircraft. Action and configuration strongly suggested that of a balloon.

COMMENTS: Possibly Balloon
Due to the improbability of further investigation uncovering new information not submitted in the preliminary report, a follow-up investigation was not authorized by this headquarters. This sighting was resolved after analysis and evaluation, as possibly a balloon, on the basis of previous reports of a similar nature.
