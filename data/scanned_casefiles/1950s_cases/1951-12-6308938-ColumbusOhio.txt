APPENDIX 1

Columbus, Ohio - 22 December 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT

On 22 December 1951 at approximately 1030 ST, an F-84 pilot sighted an unidentified object five miles east of Columbus, Ohio. The object, which looked like an aircraft with no tail surfaces, appeared to be rolling on its lateral axis. The object was on a reciprocal heading and higher than the F-86. The pilot made a turn in an attempt to intercept the object but lost it in the sun.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

At approximately 1600 EST a weather balloon was released from the Columbus Municipal airport. The wind, which was from the west, would have blown the balloon into the general vicinity of the sighting. More definite information on the balloon launching has been requested.

III. CONCLUSIONS

No conclusions can be made until more information on the balloon launching is obtained.

Columbus, Ohio - 22 December 1951

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 22 December 1951 at 1030 EST, the pilot of an F-84 aircraft observed an unidentified object five miles east of Columbus, Ohio. The F-84 was flying at 15,000 ft. altitude on a heading of 270°. The object was first sighted at two o'clock high. It appeared to be rolling on its longitudinal axis and the shape resembled an aircraft with no tail surfaces. It was on a heading of about 90°.

The pilot observed the object for one and one half minutes during which he made a right turn in an attempt to intercept and identify the object. It was lost when the pilot turned into the sun to follow the object.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
The pilot of the F-84 was interrogated by project personnel. No new facts were brought out. It was established, however, that the pilot could have observed a balloon launched from Port Columbus Airport at about 1000 EST. The wind was 30 knots from 270° which would place the balloon in the general area of the sighting. The pilot could not pinpoint his location other than about five miles east of Columbus.

III. CONCLUSIONS
The F-84 possibly sighted a weather balloon launched from Port Columbus Airport. The reported actions of and shape of the object cannot be attributed to a balloon, however, previous reports have indicated that a balloon can be very deceptive when viewed from a high speed aircraft.

SUBJECT: Information on Unconventional Aircraft

TO: Commanding General
    Air Materiel Command
    ATTN: MCIS
    Wright-Patterson AF Base
    Dayton, Ohio

1. In compliance with Air Defense Command Letter 200-1 dated 11 April 1951 and in lieu of AF Form 112 the following information is submitted:

    a. The object appeared to be an airplane of unknown size with-
    out a tail section and was silver in color. No trail or exhaust was seen
    and the propulsion system was undetermined. The observer was flying in
    the opposite direction and the object appeared to be traveling at a speed
    greater than 300 miles per hour. No sound was heard and the object continued to tumble or roll until it was lost in the sun.

    b. Object was sighted at approximately 10303 on 22 December 1951
    and was observed for approximately one (1) minute.

    c. The object was observed visually from the air. The observer
    was flying in an F-84G type aircraft at approximately 15,000 feet with an
    indicated air speed of 225.

    d. The observer was approximately five (5) miles east of Columbus,
    Ohio heading west at an altitude of 15,000 feet when the object was first
    sighted. The object was at two o'clock high from the observer, heading in
    an easterly direction at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet.

    e. The high degree of reliability of the observer is shown in
    the fact that he is a jet fighter pilot with approximately 1700 flying
    hours and served a tour of duty in the Pacific theatre of operations during World War II.

    f. The sky was clear at time of sighting.

    g. None.

    h. None.

    i. Observer started to turn to give chase but object was lost in
    the sun.

166TH FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON
142D FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR GROUP
LOCKBOURNE AIR FORCE BASE
COLUMBUS 17, OHIO

27 December 1951

STATEMENT ON SIGHTING
OF
UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT

At approximately 1030 hours on 22 December 1951 I was flying locally at 15,000 feet. I observed an object which appeared to be an aircraft without a tail section either tumbling or rolling. Position of the object was about five (5) miles east of Columbus, Ohio heading east at an altitude of at least 20,000 feet. I was piloting an F-84G type aircraft in the opposite direction.

Checks were made on Easy and Fox channels but all squadron pilots stated that they were not in that area and at that altitude. The object was about two o'clock high to me, rolling or tumbling at a high rate of roll. I observed ten or more rolls in a period of one (1) minute when I lost it in the sun. It was rolling when I lost it.

When I first sighted it I started a turn in an attempt to intercept the object, but it was lost in the sun. Further search failed to bring the object in sight.

The speed appeared to be about that of a jet fighter. It did not gain or lose altitude. When last seen it was heading in an east-south easterly direction.
