FIELD INVESTIGATION REPORT

Location: New York, N. Y.
Date: 7 July 1952
Time: 11:45 P.M.
Weather: Clear, scattered clouds.

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:

At 11:45 P.M., an unidentified bright light was observed moving rapidly in a southerly direction across the sky. The light appeared to be round or elliptical in shape, and was described as being much brighter than any star or planet. It was observed for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared from view. No sound was heard, and no vapor trail was visible.

There were several other witnesses to this sighting, including two police officers who were on patrol in the area at the time. All observers agreed that the object did not appear to be an aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of aerial vehicle.

CONCLUSION:

The nature and identity of the observed object remains unknown. It does not appear to match the characteristics of any conventional aerial vehicle. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the origin and nature of this unidentified aerial phenomenon.

STATEMENT OF ROSARIO A. FUENTE, 342 EAST 114TH STREET, NEW YORK 29, NEW YORK 
On July 7, 1952, at about 10:25 p.m., I was standing in front of 342 East 114th Street, New York, looking up at the sky when I saw some strange objects in the sky. 
The objects were round and white in color, and were traveling at a high rate of speed. They were visible for about 2 or 3 minutes. 
I was so intrigued by what I saw that I called the police station at 115th Street and Lenox Avenue. The officer on duty told me that they had received several other calls about strange objects in the sky, and that they were dispatching someone to investigate. 
I remained outside for about 15 minutes, but the objects disappeared and did not return.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ON: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS OBSERVED NEAR OGDEN, UTAH
PLACE OF SIGHTINGS: VICINITY OF OGDEN, UTAH
DATE OF INCIDENT: 20 JUNE 1952

SUMMARY: On 20 June 1952, several witnesses observed unidentified aerial objects in the vicinity of Ogden, Utah. The objects were described as luminous and moving rapidly. The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.

NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE has been discovered nor are photographs available; therefore, no interception or identification action was possible.

THERE IS NO APPARENT SIGNIFICANCE from an intelligence standpoint in this instance.

The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page contains a typed statement describing an observed unidentified aerial phenomenon that occurred on July 7, 1952 at 1030 hours in the morning. The statement is signed by Major Oscar T. Townsend of the Military Air Transport Service, Directorate of Maintenance Engineering.

STATEMENT

On 7 July 1952, the undersigned while on a duly authorized test flight in the vicinity of the U.S.A.F. Base, observed an aerial phenomenon which was seen in the pilot's seat, one in the rear cocopilot's seat, one in the navigator's seat, and one in the rear observer's seat. The objects were brilliant, silvery white in color, and approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. They were observed at an altitude of 6,000 MSL. and approximately a 3/4 mile heading when the undersigned saw a brilliant phenomenon. The objects remained in an erratic, hovering position for about 20 minutes. When first seen by this observer, the altitude was approximately 15,000 feet and the speed was in excess of 500 MPH. Later the speed reduced to about 100 MPH, hovering for a short period, and then went out of sight to the east. This phenomenon was observed by four officers in the aircraft.

In the resultant search, our aircraft traveling at a near 500 MPH could not catch these objects. Apparently they were able to accelerate to a tremendous speed. The brilliant flash, or flashes, were able to follow the cloud-type trail, and as observed later on the ground, the trail disappeared slowly, apparently due to the dissipation of the dust or particles suspended in the air.

It is the opinion of this observer that he saw a machine of a type far in advance of anything we now possess. Also, the distance from the objects to the aircraft at the nearest point was approximately 700 yards, and the possibility of its being anything else is not at all indicated in the mind of this observer. Also, the distance from the objects to the ground would tend to preclude the possibility of its being anything else. Also, the brilliance, the absence of trail, and the acceleration of the objects would tend to indicate that they were remotely controlled.

The image contains a photograph, but there is no human face present. The photograph appears to be a sketch or drawing depicting a descending object with a column of light or trail, as described in the text.

STATEMENT
On 7 July at approximately 1030 hours the undersigned was driving his car about 2 miles east of Sherman (92-01). The sky was overcast with scattered clouds and blue openings. At approximately 1045 hours his attention was drawn to a bright object descending from the southwest (approximately 225-230 degrees) to the left (northwest side) of his line of sight (approximately 280-285 degrees). This object was descending at a very high rate of speed and its motion was almost vertical. At no time was it noted to follow the path of descent. The flaming column reminded the undersigned of an emergency flare launched from a plane in distress and at first impression he felt it was a flare. However, as the object descended it became less corpulent and lighter in color and appeared to have a transparent glow or mist envelop the column to the earth's surface. The time of passage from initial sighting to disappearance was estimated to be approximately 15 to 20 seconds.
The undersigned saw no fireball or object, but did note the sudden disappearance of the bright column which seemed to blend into the surrounding conditions. This event or occurrence had an elongated "V" (V-type) shape with small particles or sparks trailing from the head of the column. It appeared to be approximately ¼ to ½ the apparent size of a star. The undersigned offered no explanation as to the nature of the object seen.

- page 26 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document page from a Project Blue Book report. The document appears to be a "Scores Report" describing an incident involving a "Fireball Here" and a "Bright Orange Flash And Light Smoke Trail". The report provides details of the sighting, including the time, location, and the observers' interpretations of what they witnessed.

Scores Report
Fireball Here
See Bright Orange Flash
And Light Smoke Trail

It was probably a meteor--rather than an exploding jet plane or guided missile or flying saucer. According to the report, the brilliant fireball and long smoke trail was seen today--it was real enough. I enclose saying they saw the phenomenon at about 10:30 a.m. and 1111 air force base near the general area. The report concludes by stating that all evidence of the explosion or flight disappeared with the sighting.

- page 27 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page of text from what seems to be a Project Blue Book document or report.

Here is the text extracted from the image:

"It was a Long Blue Streak.
Passing, flying over, it was the south, went long, blue streak. It happened like 25 minutes and then disappeared. The thing was seen from the mountain near city. We see little light but we could not see anything. Then after the mountains, the streak came again and again but we could not see anything, just the streak and illuminated the sky.
The man called up the communications man in the area and said he had no telephone calls from any place and no reports of airplanes being down in the area, when the Blue Streak appeared. The Blue Streaks were seen at 2146 and disappeared in a few seconds."

- page 28 -

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a scanned page from an old document about a reported sighting of a "fireball" or unidentified flying object over Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada.

Text from the document:

"Fireball' Geis a New Twist, Nevada Has Blast and Blaze

Yesterday morning's mysterious fireball, viewed over a vast area in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Nevada, was as much a puzzle to observers today.

Reports of witnesses varied from a "green glow fireball" followed by a "red fiery streak" to a "bright orange smoke trail."

People who know about meteors, including Charles Omonel of Charles City, la., Dr. N.V. Chernin of the University of Utah, and others, said it had to be carefully investigated.

Hobbs, assistant trainmaster at Montello, Nev., for the Southern Pacific railroad, reported many railroaders and passengers having seen the fireball. They said it appeared to shoot across the sky from east to west during the day and saw a column of smoke and dust hanging in the sky.

Montello is about 112 miles almost due west from Salt Lake City, and Reno and Carson City, Nev. reported the seven-blue cloud outlined with yellow dust remained for several minutes, then gradually lifted away.

Ralph Gibbs, soil conservation official, and ranchers were led to investigate. They found a 600-acre tract burned in Dairy Valley, 26 miles north and five miles east of Montello. They could find, however, no evidence of a meteor fall.

L.E. Taylor, U.S. weather bureau, today told a hurry of excitement was caused here when a high flying B-36 with the vapor trail was mistaken for a fireball over the city."

Flaming Meteorite 
Stirs West Areas

A flaming object which streaked across the sky Sunday morning about 10:13 a.m. over Salt Lake City, Ogden and other northern Utah areas, apparently a meteorite, first was observed near Lake City Utah, according to reports received here. 
Observers at Boise said they believed it was about 10 a.m. and that it traveled in a northeasterly direction

Rudolph Ortloff, 1214 Arlington, Ogden, said he and a companion, Verl Robison, were driving east on Washington Blvd. when they saw a bright flash in the sky and then a trailing streak of flame. They said the object was moving rapidly toward the east.

Gus C. Backman, executive secretary of the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce, said to was described to him as a "long trail with a light coming through it" He said he heard no explosion or saw any debris falling, though the flash in the sky was pronounced.

Carl H. Becker, assistant foreman of the Salt Lake Municipal Airport, said the object passed over the airport, leaving a trail of smoke, but did not hit the ground. He said it appeared to be a brilliant meteor or burned out rocket heading in a northeasterly direction.

The Allwant Traffic Control Station at Cedar City said they received a report of the incident as did the Cedar City Chamber of Commerce.

C. W. Russell, deputy sheriff of Sevier County reported seeing what he thought was a lighted object on the northern horizon in the vicinity of Ephraim. This was about 10:13 a.m. the approximate time the object was reported seen in Salt Lake City.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DATE: 7-22-52

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SIGHTED NEAR UTICA AND WAS OBSERVED FOR A PERIOD OF 20 MINUTES. OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED AT 11:20 P.M. EASTERN STANDARD TIME, AUGUST 1, 1952, NEAR UTICA, NEW YORK.

The object appeared to be 1/3 inch in diameter and grew larger as it approached. The object seemed to be 5/8 inch or 1/2 inch in diameter when it reached the size at which it remained. The object then faded to the size of 1/16 inch when last seen. The color of the object at first sighting was a dull white. The color changed to a brilliant blue-white, to a blue, and then faded completely. It followed an erratic course, leaving a trail of smoke or dust that trailed after the object. The speed of the object was unknown. The observer said nothing as to sounds the object may have made. The observation was made by the observer with no visual aids or any other sighting equipment. The object was sighted through the glass windshield of his car. At the closest distance the observer could estimate, the object was approximately one o'clock high. The duration of the observation from the time the object was first sighted until it disappeared was approximately 20 to 25 minutes. 

Mr. [REDACTED] is the only one that submitted a report on this object and no other witnesses are known of.

Mr. [REDACTED] has a reputation with 3 years' experience and it is assumed that the information given by him should be accurate because of his experience with such matters.

The observer stated that the observation took place on a dark, moon-light night, and it was impossible to determine any exact size and place of the object in relation to known objects. There was no known astronomical activity or otherwise which might account for the sighting. There is no possibility of identifying the object as anything known to the observer. The sighting with the description of the lighting along with the erratic course of the object, as stated.

"July 7, 1952
UNCLASSIFIED

Executive Order in Charge of Public Relations
Goodfellow Field
San Angelo, Texas

Dear Sir:

On the morning of July 7, 1952, at 2:40 a.m., I sighted a blue-green object trailing a steady tail. I have been interested in the "Flying Saucer" and Meteor Question for some time. I do not commit myself by saying that the object was a "visitor" but rather a meteor.

The following is an accurate account of what I saw:

I was in bed trying to sleep, when suddenly, I observed the brilliant object cross the sky from east to west. It was an intense white light, described by one witness, (an elderly retired military person who was immediately behind me), as being the "brightest object I have ever seen in the sky". As it crossed the sky, it appeared to tilt slightly, allowing a glimpse of the side view as it passed. As it passed, I was starting up again toward the wall going east. As I looked up again in the direction it had gone, I was shocked to see a brilliant light hovering, as they say, coming into view from behind the East horizon. This "hovering car", as they say, coming into view from behind the east horizon. This "hovering car", as they say, dominating the sky, was viewed for a period of about 30 to 40 seconds, in the space marked "A", brilliant blue white in color, and appeared to be slightly elliptical in shape. Its brilliance was such that all objects in the space marked "A" were in silhouette, so intense was the illumination. It then appeared to descend slowly, straight down, while maintaining the same brilliance. As it appeared to approach the horizon, or the trees, the brilliance appeared to diminish, and finally disappeared from sight completely. This all happened in an elapsed time of approximately 30 to 40 seconds. I last observed the light as it appeared to be descending behind the trees on the horizon.

I last the object well. It was on an elevation that could not have been other than a minimum of 30 to 1000 feet. I took my elevation line-of-sight with a nearby telephone post, and it was at an elevation that could not have been other than a minimum of 30 to 1000 feet. I was leaning on my elbows on the porch rail, and it cleared the telephone pole in the foreground by about 200 yards. It was not heavily lighted. I was lying there staring at the sky, just passing the time of day, when the brilliant light appeared to the East, just about where it disappeared from sight. It was 40 minutes 5 seconds past 2:50 a.m. when the object was first sighted, and the elapsed time was approximately 30 to 40 seconds from start to finish.

I want you to know that I am taking this matter to your office, as I feel a report should be made to the proper authorities, so that they can investigate this phenomenon, if they so desire. I have been somewhat reticent about these matters in the past, but I feel that in view of the urgency of the situation, and the possibility of its importance, I should make this report without further delay.

Sincerely yours,

(Signature)"

Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

Just regained its original shape and will no longer make it out. I do not have a camera to take a picture to send you. It was about 2 1/2" in diameter and about 1/4" thick. The object was first observed by a young boy, about 12 years of age, at 6:30 pm on July 28, 1952 in Abilene, Texas. The object made a noise as it first appeared to be about 3/4" in diameter and became larger until it was about 2 1/2" in diameter. It then suddenly disappeared to about 1/2" in diameter and soon after went out completely. The Flight Officer at the local airport was immediately notified and he said it was going to the left of the airport and disappeared. This object is the first that has ever been observed in this area.

Enclosed you will find a print to help clarify my sighting report.

If I may be of further services, please do not hesitate to ask.

I have informed the Police Department here in Abilene and expect a report from them soon regarding this sighting. The time of the sighting was approximately 6:30 pm, July 28, 1952, and the object was seen by a young boy, about 12 years of age, in Abilene, and the time. If any of the policemen saw the object, I will send you the information they give me.

I would appreciate any help you can give me that would aid me in making a more accurate report should I see another such object. I will especially want to know how to determine the distance of the object from me, as this all will aid in making a more detailed report.

I am a draftsman with some eight years of experience so I trust my approximations will be close to correct.

Very truly yours,

CASE 2-2

Morning. 24 April 1952, ATIC was notified by Wilburn B. Marks, Jr. , 3219 Carlisle Blvd., N. E., Albuquerque, N. M., that he had sighted an unknown object on 23 April 1952 at 8:10 p. m. which he had observed for 30 seconds. The object appeared to be 1/3 inch in diameter and grew larger as it approached. It seemed to be neon red and yellow. The object remained at the same height at a speed of 3/3 inch in 1/3 inch in diameter. The object then faded to the size of 1/15 inch when last seen. The color of the object at first was a deeper green, followed by flashes of a red-white light, leaving a trail of sparks in what seemed to be a shower of dust or smoke that trailed after the object. The object made no maneuvers except one slight deviation from its course.
The observation was made by the observer with no visual aids or any other sight-enhancing equipment. The object was sighted through the glass wind-shield of his car. At the time of the observation, the observer was 15 miles west of Abilene, Texas, sitting in his car and sighted the object at approximately one o'clock high. The object was observed at an angle of 30° to 35°. The direction of the object, as believed, by the observer, to be North. Altitude was not estimated by the observer. 
Mr. Marks is the only one that submitted a report on this object and no other witnesses are known of.
Mr. Marks is a draftsman with 8 years experience and it is assumed that the calculations given by him should be accurate because of his experience with such. The observer stated that the observation took place on a cool, moonlight night, with a few scattered clouds. He made no mention of wind at the time and place of sighting, with the exception that wind was responsible for the slight change in the direction of the object.
There was no known meteorological activity or otherwise which might account for the sighting of the object. There is no physical evidence, fragments, photographs or other tangible evidence of the existence of the observed item.

8. The object was brightly illuminated, solid in center with a nebula surrounding it with a diameter of approximately 100 ft. The nebula was continuous and gave no indication of rotat ion by the atmosphere. Nebula was irregular, slightly lighter in color than the surrounding sky. In the observatory view of it, it appeared to be equivalent in size to the full moon. There was no oscillations or sound. Disappeared behind clouds which were too dense to permit further observation.
a. Occurred at 2013 hours, 7 July 1952. Visible for approximately three (3) seconds.
2. Visual sighting observed from ground.
3. One dazzling white light, 40-70 feet in diameter, with the tail of scattered red lights on the eastern side of the object. Altitude appeared to be 3000-5000 feet, but this estimate is subject to considerable error as there was no means of accurately estimating the size of the object or determining its altitude. Position in sky was approximately 300°.

8. There was no physical evidence, such as fragments, photographs and the like, of the sighting. 
9. No interpretation or identification action was taken.
10. There was no air traffic in the general area of the sighting.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
1. I have had an interview with the officer who observed the phenomenon described in this report. This officer had been working for the Air Materiel Command at Muroc, California. He was working for this Command on a flying saucer project and by reason of his experience along that line, he expressed an opinion as to what he considered the object to be. However, I would be impressed by the fact that some of his statements later proved to be mass hallucinations and distorted versions of actual facts, rather than a true report of what he saw. I hesitated before turning in a record of my observation.
"The Captain" as he is known to the section of Air Materiel Command handling the flying saucer project, is an individual full of enthusiasm and optimism.
2. This Directorate checked with the Control Tower of Pope AFB, with the Headquarters of the 507th Tac Control Group, G-2 2nd Airborne Division, and the Weather Squadron at Pope AFB. The weather conditions, meteorological or otherwise, taking place at the time of sighting.
4. Captain ___ impressed me as a conservative individual and not given to exaggerated statements. He stressed the fact that he had this flying object in view for only a few seconds and had no real point of reference from which to check its size or altitude. He inferred it may have been at a considerable altitude.

The UFO was observed by several witnesses over the skies of New York City on July 7, 1952. The object appeared as a bright, luminous sphere that moved rapidly across the sky. Witnesses reported that the object changed direction abruptly and disappeared at a high rate of speed. No physical evidence or debris was recovered from the incident. The Air Force's Project Blue Book, tasked with investigating UFO sightings, catalogued this event as an "unknown" due to the lack of conclusive evidence.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

First noticed object because of its shape and our inability to
figure what it could be. Suddenly realized there were four or
five (possibly round) objects, and while coming, they were
on the face they were evenly spaced saw them; they were
watching movement of them was rapid and erratic, keeping
their shape, that is, no turning, tumbling or anything; we
had over seen them. The two planes were in the sky at the time,
but were too distant for us to discern whether they were
watching the objects or not.  Nothing plane gave any indication of anything unusual occurring at the time.

20. Do not feel at all qualified to estimate distance or speed.
However, the objects appeared to be below the horizon, in front of
the mountains - perhaps 10-12 miles distant. 

22 -- These objects remained at about the same height, and from
our position appeared to be below the horizon, in front of
the mountains. When the objects first came into view we
were no longer able to see them through the back window.
At the same time they disappeared from our view.

27. At the time they were observed, it appeared unusual, resembling
something never seen before, having a speed, anything like it, though we
estimated they moved faster than sight. As we returned the same spot on
July 10th on our way home we remembered having seen a U.F.0. in an
El Paso paper, having seen the photographs at Alamagordo and
seen a so-called flying saucer the same day we had visited
Holloman Air Force Base and were on our way home, we assumed
what we saw was not unusual in that locality and it was not
until we returned home that we thought it sufficiently important to report.

1. EVIDENCE: Sighted by civilian in vicinity of El Paso, Texas, 7 July 1952. Believed to be an unidentified aircraft per attached eyewitness report.

2. DETAILS: This office was advised telephonically, 30 July 1952, by a witness that the following:

On 7 July 1952, while visiting her son, an El Paso, Texas, resident, she and her husband and daughter observed for a period estimated by them to be approximately 1,000 hours, a spherical object in the sky over El Paso, which moved and maneuvered in a manner she stated was definitely not characteristic of any known aircraft. This spherical object, the size of which she estimated as about 50 feet in diameter, changed color from red to orange to blue to white. It made no noise and appeared to be under intelligent control. She stated that it would dart, stop, hover, and make extremely rapid maneuvers, all the while changing color, for the period of time mentioned.

On another occasion, her husband and daughter, while driving north to Alamogordo, New Mexico, also observed several spherical objects, which they were unable to identify.

RECORD OF INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. DATE OF OBSERVATION: 12 JULY 52
2. TIME OF OBSERVATION: 2000 EST
3. LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: NEW YORK, N.Y.
4. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S):
The object was observed silently hovering and maneuvering at an altitude of 1000-2000 feet above the ground for approximately 5 minutes. The object had a luminous pale blue oval shape with two appendages extending from the center. The object was observed by one observer, Mr. Edward Rommel, who was located at 37-11 103rd St., Corona, New York.
5. BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION:
The object was observed hovering and maneuvering silently at an altitude of approximately 1000-2000 feet. After approximately 5 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and streaked out of sight at a high rate of speed. Mr. Rommel was able to observe the object clearly and stated that it was definitely not an aircraft, helicopter, or any known type of aerial vehicle. No other witnesses were present at the time of the observation.
6. CONCLUSIONS:
The object observed appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). There is no logical explanation for the type of aerial maneuvers and performance characteristics exhibited by the object. The case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

On 3 July 1952 an unidentified object was observed by three observers at a position west of Orlando, Florida, on West Central Avenue. The observers were flying a small private plane when the object was sighted. The object was described as disc-shaped, silver in color, and appeared to have a diameter of about 30 feet. The object was travelling at a very high rate of speed, estimated attitude of 6000 Feet. 

The object was travelling from north to south. When first sighted, the object was higher than the plane. After keeping the object in sight for about 45 seconds, it disappeared. No sound was heard.

The object was dull gray in color and appeared to be a concave disc. The observers stated she had seen 3 to 5 similar aircraft in the air and the object was approximately 1/3 of the diameter.

Weather at time of sighting was CAVU with thunderheads in area. No interceptions were made, and no photographs were taken.

The 327 Tactical Wing of the Naval Air Station was flying in the vicinity of Orlando during period of observation but no planes from the 327th were reportedly involved.

Date of Incident: 07 Jul 52
Location: NEW YORK, NEW YORK
Witness: [REDACTED]
Summarized observation: The witness reported observing a luminous, unidentified aerial object at approximately 10:45 PM on July 7, 1952. The object was described as circular in shape, with an estimated diameter of 30-40 feet, and emitting a bright white light. The object was observed moving at a high rate of speed, changing direction abruptly, and appearing to hover briefly before accelerating and rapidly disappearing from view.
Investigator's Findings: The object observed by the witness could not be conclusively identified as any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The rapid movements and unusual characteristics of the object are inconsistent with conventional explanations. The case remains unresolved.
