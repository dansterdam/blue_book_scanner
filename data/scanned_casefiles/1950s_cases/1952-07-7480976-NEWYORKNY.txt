SUMMARY: (Enter complete summary of report. Use single paragraph. List inclosures in lower left, begin text of report on line 1--Form 112)

It is not a secret. From newspaper and statement sources, witnesses described an unusual flying object which appeared to be a ball of flame which traveled at a high rate of speed. The object sighting was set at approximately 1030 hours MST, 7 July 1952, and the entire performance was of a few seconds duration.

Manner of observation by all witnesses was visual, with no optical or electronic equipment having been used. One witness (Statement attached as Incl #1) observed the object from the air in a B-26 type aircraft, altitude of 6000 MSL, time air speed 300 MPH.

Location of observers covered a vast area in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Nevada with resultant variations in reports of location of the object with respect to observers.

Reliability of witnesses, whose statements are attached as Incls 1 and 2, is considered "reliable."

Weather, at the time of sighting, was clear with surface winds reported of 20 to 30 knots, with gusts to 40 knots from the Northeast in the vicinity of Hill AFS, Utah.

There is no known activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

No physical evidence has been discovered nor are photographs available; therefore, no interdiction or identification action was possible.

The only known air traffic was as reported above.

There is no apparent significance from an intelligence standpoint in this instance.

STATEMENT

At 1030 hours on the morning of 7 July 1952, the undersigned while on a duty authorized test flight in a B-26 type aircraft, observed an aerial phenomenon in the vicinity of Hill AFB, Ogden, Utah. The crew included three civilians, members of the Flight Test Branch, one riding in the Engineer's seat, one in the rear checking radio and armament equipment and one riding in the nose. The weather at the time was clear, visibility over 10 miles with surface winds of 20 to 30 knots, with gusts to 40 knots from the Northeast.

The aircraft was departing Hill AFB at an altitude of 6000 MSL, and approximately a 340° heading when the underbody saw a brilliant yellowish, orange flame descending southward at a near vertical angle. It appeared to be moving from a South to North direction at a very high rate of speed. When first seen by this observer, its azimuth was estimated at approximately 50°, and this flame continued until nearly a 5 or 100 azimuth was reached. Immediately following this flame, and in its place was a blush, gaseous type cloud nearly half the length of the flame. Immediately below the end of the flame and cloud, a dark object was seen to follow the same trajectory.

The entire performance was at a split-second speed, faster than anything ever seen by this observer. By crew, although they did not see the flash, were able to follow the cloud-type trail, and we expected to see the dark object hit in adjacent Great Salt Lake or at least the shore immediately North of the estimated position.

In the resultant search, our aircraft traveling at a near 300 MPH at airspeed, could not reach the cloud trail nor see any evidence of an object having struck the ground.

The Hill AFB tower was notified immediately and an extended search of the area by the undersigned revealed little else.

It is the opinion of this observer that he saw a meteorite of better than average size traveling at a rate of speed so great as to preclude the possibility of its being anything else. Also, the distance from the phenomenon indicated the size and brilliance, and is the reason for not being able to see any evidence of this object striking the ground in this area.

STATEMENT

On 7 July at approximately 1030 hours the undersigned was driving his car north on US Highway 89-91, midway between Provo and Pleasant Grove, at a speed of approximately 40 MPH. At approximately 20 to 30 degrees to the left (northwest), of his line of sight (north) he saw a flash of light and immediately turning his eyes in the direction of the flash he observed the following at approximately 111 degrees 45 minutes west longitude and 40 degrees 20 minutes north latitude:

The morning sky was clear and blue with the exception of a few scattered clouds on the horizon. Outflung clearly and distinctly against this background was a seething, boiling, turbulent, brilliant orange column of what appeared to be a flame which surged upwardly seemingly to follow the path of descent. The flaming column reminded the undersigned of an oil flame such as smoke and flame color. The brilliant orange color and turbulence comprising the column was more noticeable at its base or earth end. Becoming less turbulent and lighter in color as this observer glanced up the column, which tapered in proportion to its length, to the extreme limits of this observer's sight. At a translatable distance, a transparent glow or mist enveloped the column to the extreme limits of this observer's sight. The column appeared to be absolutely straight (no breaks or deviations) with a northwesterly inclination of not too great an angle (approximately 15 to 20 degrees). The entire column of turbulence was seen almost instantaneously which to this observer was indicative of something traveling at a terrific speed. The undersigned saw no fireball or object but did see the base or earth end of the column. The column of turbulence at its nearest approach to the earth appeared to be approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter, ending in an elongated "V" (vee) shape with small particles emanating from the junction of the two sides forming the "V". The column ended at approximately 200 to 300 feet from the earth's surface and blotted out by its diameter that portion of a mountain on the opposite side of the valley approximately 15 to 20 miles to the west. No smoke was visible during the display or after the column faded from sight. The column was visible for several seconds and during this period there was no explosion or audible sound.

Assumptions. A container from which a substance, upon release, became a turbulent flame, surging and boiling upward in the opposite direction (130 degrees) from the downward (sky to earth) path of the flash. The reason that the undersigned saw no container was due to its terrific speed and the relatively short distance the base of the column appeared from his point of observation.

MONDAY EVENING, JULY 7, 1952

Scores Report
Fireball Here
See Bright Orange Flash
And Light Smoke Trail

It was probably a meteor—rather than an exploding jet plane, guided missile or flying saucer.
But whatever caused the brilliant fireball and long smoke trail in the skies northwest of Ogden today—it was real enough.

Enough, called The Standard Examiner a meteor saying they saw the phenomenon at about 10:50 a.m. and Hill air force base even dispatched a search plane to the general area.

The pilot, Maj. Robert S. Kalweit, said all evidence of the explosion—that's what it was—had disappeared when he circled the vicinity in a B-29 bomber.

It may have been the same flaming object sighted from Nevada, Idaho and eastern Oregon. Some pilots insisted it was a meteorite that fell and started a forest fire near the Utah-Idaho border.

Although Ogden area observers saw no particles falling after the tower operator said he saw a "square black object" plummet to the ground.

Most witnesses located it a mile or so northwest of Ogden municipal airport.

They said a bright orange fireball traveled downward from the south, leaving a "gaseous" light blue smoke trail and suddenly seemed to flare brightly and disappeared. None reportedly falling after the object had been at an altitude of from 4000 to 25,000 feet.

A check with Hill field and the CAA communications tower at Ogden Airport showed no military or civilian aircraft were known to be in the vicinity.

It fitted the general description of a meteor, but an expert said it is very unusual for one to be so bright enough to be seen during daylight.

And bright this one was—indeed. So bright there was even daylight.

astronomy instructor, said the long trail of smoke and grain (hazy) were characteristic of a meteorite.

He said meteorites enter the atmosphere at a speed of about 30 miles a second and are usually entirely consumed before reaching the earth.

Osmond declared that the meteorites which fell in the Seattle area last year were accompanied by terrific explosions heard all over the city. No new reports of such a phenomenon were received in connection with today's spectacle.

C.A.A. communications man in the control tower at Ogden Municipal airport said they had no reports of anything coming down, setting a lot of telephone calls from persons who had seen a flash and an explosion.

The C.A.A. man said he had no reports of airplanes being down. These were not those of falling aircraft, he said.

"It was a Long Blue Streak"

Among those who saw it were: Marvin Williams and Norman Jones, both of Salt Lake City; an orange fireball, which suddenly expanded, then disappeared leaving a haze of white smoke.

Robert Kaufman of Salt Lake City said it was like a blue streak with a long bluish-green trail. His description tallied with the others.

Mrs. George Soterras, 148 26th St., said it looked like a comet with a long bluish-green trail.

Robert Sellier of Salt Lake City said it appeared to be about 24,000 to 25,000 feet high when he first saw the object which "exploded with a yellow light, then a ball of fire kept falling in air."

He said it went out at about 10,000 feet leaving a cloud of white smoke. It seemed to come from Layton.

Ernest M. Wilson, 470 34th St., said he saw it from his back yard. About five minutes later, he said, smoke began curling up from the ground, directly below where the flash and illumination was.

TUESDAY EVENING, JULY 8, 1952

'Fireball' Gets a New Twist,
Nevada Has Blast and Blaze

Yesterday morning's mysterious fireball, viewed over
a vast area in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Nevada,
was still just as much a mystery today.

Reports of witnesses varied from a "green pea fireball
followed by a long orange streamer" to a "bright orange
fireball with a gaseous light blue smoke trail."

People who know about meteors, including Charles
Osmond of Weber college and Dr. R. N. Thomas of the
University of Utah, agreed it had to be awfully big.

A new twist was injected this morning when W. S.
Hobbs, assistant trainmaster at Montello, Nev., for the
Southern Pacific railroad, reported many railroaders and
others heard a heavy explosion about 10:30 a. m. yesterday and saw a column of smoke and dust hanging in the sky.

Montello is about 112 miles almost due west of Ogden
as the crow flies. Hobbs said the grayish-blue cloud, outlined
with yellow dust remained for several minutes, then gradually drifted away.

He said there was no known blasting in the area at the
time.

Ralph Gibbs, soil conservation official, and ranchers
went out to investigate. They found a 600-acre tract burned
in Dairy valley, 28 miles north and five miles east of Montello. They could find, however, no evidence of a meteor.

At 1 p. m. today a brief flurry of excitement was caused
here when a high flying B-36 with its vapor trail was mistaken for a fireball over the city.

Here is the text from the newspaper article:

LAKE CITY, UTAH, TUESDAY MORN, JULY 8, 1952

Flaming Meteorite
Stirs West Areas

A flaming object which streaked across the sky Monday morning caused a flurry of excitement among observers in Northern Utah, Northern Nevada, Idaho and Eastern Oregon. It is believed to have started a forest fire near the Utah-Nevada line.

The object, presumably a meteorite, first was observed near Pendleton, Ore., by an Empire Air Lines pilot. He thought it was a meteorite.

Observers at Boise said they noticed it about 10 a.m. and that it fell to somewhere south of that city.

At 10:52 a.m. numerous persons in Salt Lake City saw the object and began tracing the sky to the northwest at high speed.

Rudolph Orton, 1514 Arlington St., who was walking along Main St., described the brilliant flash of light as "like an enormous sky rocket being shot toward the earth instead of upward."

Gus Backman, executive secretary, Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce, said he thought it might have been a rocket dropped from an airplane.

He described it as a "long white streak, which exploded with a brilliant flash," and said he heard no concussion, although the flash lit the area with greater intensity than the sun.

W. 2nd South, also reported, Paul E. Strong, general foreman, and John Livingston, labor foreman at Vitro Chemical Co., 600 W. 2nd South, also reported seeing the flash, which they described as a "wedge-shaped" streak of fire which left a trail of smoke.

A control tower operator at Salt Lake Municipal Airport described the phenomenon as a "streak of light that was green but changed to red. He said the object exploded somewhere west of Great Salt Lake with a brilliant black streak, trailed by a trail of black object - "more square than round" - fell to the ground.

Seen at Cedar City

The Army's Traffic Control Center at Cedar City also reported the object was seen by airmen over Reno, Donner Summit, Cal., and Hanksville, Wayne County.

From as far south as Cedar of an Iron County representative in the Utah legislature, and her son, Russell, reported seeing what they at first thought was a flash of lightning on the northern horizon.

defense and police officers through-
out the area but the CAA center in
Salt Lake City said there were no

Dr. N. Thomas, associate
Professor of astronomy at the
University of Utah, said if the
mass was that of a meteor-
ite, it would have been awfully big.
Ordinary meteors soon at night
are about 50 to 80 miles above man's
about 60 to 80 miles above the
earth. The size is caused by the meteor
as it comes to the earth.

He could only trained observer
can estimate the size of a meteor.

Charles Osmond, Weber College
meteorologist, said the object
may have been a meteor. How-
ever, it would be unusual. How-
was, so bright in the middle of
the day he said.

Bureau Meteorologic, U.S. Weather
said that when it was passing through the field,
it was easily could come ear-

College, Logan, who observed the
phenomenon, said the object was a meteorite, but dis-
counted its ability to start a fire. For
a meteorite when it is cool enough to
be touched by a human hand. It
could not start a fire.

Dear Sir:

On the morning of July 7, 1952, at 3:40 a.m., I sighted a blue-green object falling to the surface of the earth.

I have been interested in the "Flying Saucer and Meteor Question" for some time. I do not commit myself by saying that the object was a "Saucer" but rather a meteor.

The following is an accurate account of what I saw.

I was 15 miles west of Abilene, Texas, when a driver who was apparently drunk or sleepy pulled over on my side of the road. I came to a complete stop because I would have no way of knowing where he might go next. After his passing, I was starting up again toward Abilene going east. As I looked into the rear view mirror, I saw what I thought to be a "Falling Star" as they say, coming into view from behind the rear view mirror through the front windshield. I let the motor idle and watched for it to black out, instead it changed from dull white to a green "A" to brilliant white, in the space marked "B", brilliant blue white changing to brilliant blue in space marked "D", brilliant copper green in space marked "D" was a huge flash of red-white light which was followed by a large white trail in space "E". Leaving a trail of "Sparks" in what seemed to be a shower of dust or smoke that trailed after the object. In space "F" was another flash of white light not so brilliant as the first and approximately 1/3 the size.

Taking effect slowly and lasting longer, in the last section "G" the white ball appeared again only about 1/3 the size previously, the second part of section "D" or middle part, the trail left a long white "ball" like a comet, and the call or light became more dull; in the last section of space "G" only a dull white ball about 1/3 its original size could be seen falling slowly toward Abilene which was in view.

I last saw the dull whitish orange ball when it was on an elevation about 200 miles above the total western area in this vicinity. I took my calculations then: I was driving a 1951 4 door 200 series Ford, not heavily loaded. I am 5'9" high and weigh 145 lbs. I was leaning on the driver's door as in figure #1. I wear a 16 x 30 shirt, 6 7/8 hat. The detailed line from the rear mirror to present location to my position while in the car. When the object reached the point between B and C, I stopped the car and checked my watch for the exact time. It was 10 minutes 5 seconds past 3:30 a.m. I made the following notes immediately with the distances and path of the successive changes in the object. The only change in the path of the object was at the point between C and D. I just before the brilliant flash the object moved almost horizontally.

ject regained its original path until I could no longer make it out. I do
not have a compass therefore the only direction I can give you at this time is
that I was facing East. The object appeared from behind my rear view mirror,
and ended up approximately over the top of my windshield wiping on the driver's
side. The total (often was approximately 3" to the left of the end on my
windshield wiper. I am as still as possible while watching the object. It
first appeared to be about 1/2" in diameter in space A and B and began to grow
larger in "C" until the 3/8 or 1/2" also covered approximately 2 inches in
diameter. The object grew smaller from this point on until it was approxi-
mately 1/16" in diameter when I at could see it.

Enclosed you will find a print to help clearify my sighting report.

If I may be of further service, please do not hesitate to ask.

I have informed the Police Department here in Abilene and expect a re-
port from the Desk Sergeant late this evening. If any of the Patrolmen
might have seen the object, I have asked that they give me the direction he
saw the object from Abilene, and the time. If any of the policemen saw the
object, I will send you the information post haste.

I would appreciate any help you can give me that would aid me in making
a more accurate report should I see another such object. I will, especially
want to know how to determine the distance of the object from me, its alti-
tude, direction, etc.

I am a draftsman with some eight years of experience so I trust my
approximations will be close to correct.

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]

Object was sighted by [redacted] College Drive, Abilene, Texas, on the
morning of July 1952, at 0310 and was observed for a period of 20 seconds. When first
sighted the object appeared to be 1/3 inch in diameter and grew larger as it progress-
ed toward the earth until it reached the size of 3/3 inch or 1/2 inch in diameter.

The flashes that were emitted were approximately 2 inches in diameter. The object
then faded to the size of 1/15 inch when last seen. The color of the object at first
sighting was a dull white. The color changed to a brilliant blue-white, to a blue,
to a copper green, followed by flashes of red-white light, leaving a trail of sparks
in what seemed to be a shower of dust or smoke that trailed after the object. The
speed of the object was unknown. The observer said nothing as to sounds the object may
have made. The object made no maneuvers except one slight deviation from its course.

The observation was made by the observer with no visual aids or any other sight-
ing equipment. The object was sighted through the glass wind-shield of his car. At
the time of the observation, the observer was 15 miles west of Abilene, Texas, sitting
in his car and sighted the object at approximately one o'clock high. The object was
proceeding toward the ground at an angle of 30° to 35°. The direction of the object
is believed, by the observer, to be North. Altitude was not estimated by the observer.

Mr. [redacted] is the only one that submitted a report on this object and no other
witnesses are known of.

Mr. [redacted] is a draftsman with 8 years experience and it is assumed that the
calculations given by him should be accurate because of his experience with such.

The observer stated that the observation took place on a cool, moon-light night,
with a few scattered clouds. He made no mention of wind at the time and place of
sighting, with the exception that wind was responsible for the slight change in the
course of the object, as stated.

There was no known meteorological activity or otherwise which might account for
the sighting of the object. There is no physical evidence, fragments, photographs or
other physical evidence of the sighting with the exception of the diagram drawn.

At Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 7 July 1952, at 2015 hours during a low, scattered overcast, Captain [redacted] USAF, of 3250 Technical Training Group, observed (with his wife) a large green light, solid in the center surrounded by a nebula with a trail of isolated red lights.

This object was traveling in a northerly direction approximately 400 MPH. The nebula was constant with no indications of atmospheric resistance. The phenomena was visible for about three seconds and appeared to be at a height of from three to five thousand feet. It appeared to be the size of the full moon but there was no means of estimating the actual size or other comparative data.

Its position in the sky was about 45-500. It disappeared behind dense clouds and during its course, emitted no noticeable sound.

AF FORM 112—PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. Large, green light, solid in center with a nebula surrounding it with a trail of isolated red lights. The nebula on the object was constant and gave no indication of resistance by the atmosphere. Nebula was irregular, slightly lighter in color than the core. In the momentary view of it, it appeared to be equivalent in size to the full moon. There was no noticeable sound. Estimated approximate speed 400 MPH. Disappeared behind clouds which were too dense to permit further observation.

2. Observed at 2015 hours, 7 July 1952. Visible for approximately three (3) seconds.

3. Visual sighting observed from ground.

4. Observed at Ft Bragg, N. C., flying NW by N with the trail of scattered red lights on the Eastern side of the object. Altitude appeared to be 3000-5000 feet, but this estimate is subject to considerable error as there was no means of estimating the size of the object or other comparative data. Position in sky 45°-50°.

5. Observed by Captain [redacted] USAF
2250 Technical Training Group
Scott AFB, Illinois
(374 Dougherty Ave., Ft Bragg, N. C.)

Captain [redacted] was Provost Marshal and Base Intelligence Officer at Marne AFB (advance) and was assigned as interviewer and observer on project "Flying Saucer" for Air Materiel Command. Captain Theodore Winch, USAF of Hq Air Materiel Command knows about Captain [redacted] connection with "Flying Saucer" Project.

7. There was no activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

8. There was no physical evidence, such as fragments, photographs and the like, of the sighting.

9. No interception or identification action was taken.

10. There was no air traffic in the general area of the sighting.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. I have had an interview with the officer who observed the phenomenon described below. This officer has had previous experience as an observer and reporter for the Air Materiel Command at Muroc, California. He was working for this Command on the "Flying Saucer" Project and by reason of his experience along that line, he impressed me as having a good knowledge of the subject. As he expressed it, "Because of so many reports that later proved to be mass hallucinations and distorted views of material objects, I am rather skeptical about most of the stories on Flying Saucers. I hesitated before turning in a record of my observation."

2. Captain [REDACTED] is known to the section of Air Materiel Command handling the "Flying Object" Project as is explained in the above paragraph.

3. This Directorate checked with the Control Tower of Pope AFB, with the Headquarters of the 507th Tac Control Group, G-2 32nd Airborne Division, and the Weather Squadron at Pope AFB. As nearly as may be determined, there were no unusual activities or conditions, meteorological or otherwise, taking place at the time of sighting.

4. Captain [REDACTED] impressed me as a conservative individual and one not given to exaggerated statements. He stressed the fact that he had this flying object in view for only a few seconds and had no real points of reference from which to check its size.

20. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

First noticed object because of its shape and our inability to figure what it could be. Suddenly realized there were four or these oddly (completely round) shaped things, and while commenting on the fact they were evenly spaced saw there were seven. Kept watching because of their unusual shape and exact spacing. We were intrigued because they were so different from anything we had ever seen. Two planes were in the sky at the time, one very high and the other lower. Neither plane gave any indication of anything unusual occurring at the time.

20. Do not feel at all qualified to estimate distance or speed. However, at that point the mountains are, I believe, between 15 - 20 miles distance and sighted objects were in front of the mountains - perhaps 10-12 miles distant.

22 - 23

These objects remained at about the same height, and from our position appeared to be below the top of the mountain, and some distance in front of it. When first sighted, they were considerably ahead of us and we kept them in view until we were no longer able to see through the car window, due to distance. At all times they kept the same shape and formation and solidity.

27. At the time we watched it because we were tremendously interested, never having seen anything like it, though we attached no importance to it. As we passed the same spot on July 10th on our way home we remembered having read an El Paso paper that one of the physicists at Alamogordo had seen a so-called 'flying saucer' the same day we had witnessed these objects and flying saucer. Because of the close proximity of Biggs airport at El Paso and Holoman air field near Alamogordo, we assumed what was unusual in that locality and it was not until we returned home that we thought it sufficiently important to report.

SUBJECT INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SUBJECT: Unconventional Aircraft
Vicinity El Paso, Texas
7 July 1952

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

1. SUMMARY: Spherical object sighted by civilian in vicinity of El Paso, Texas(7 July 1952) believed to be similar to objects reported in El Paso newspaper as seen by an Alamogordo scientist.

2. DETAILS: This office was advised telephonically, 30 July 1952, by a [redacted] of the following:

a. On 7 July 1952, Mrs. [redacted] while visiting her son, stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas, was enroute approximately fifty (50) miles from El Paso, New Mexico, and daughter into Alamogordo, New Mexico. She stated, she and her daughter observed at about 1000 hours a spherical object in the sky to the northward of her automobile. This spherical object was joined by three (3) more of the same objects and in seconds later three (3) more, totaling seven (7) spherical objects, which were very high and far to the northward, passed. She could not determine the color of these objects nor the speed at which they were traveling in a southerly direction, but she did recall that they seemed to be flying in perfect formation (very evenly spaced).

She later observed these objects for some time until they disappeared to the south. Mrs. [redacted] further observed two (2) aircraft at the same time, one of which seemed to be a single-engine aircraft and the other which was quite high and distant. She could
