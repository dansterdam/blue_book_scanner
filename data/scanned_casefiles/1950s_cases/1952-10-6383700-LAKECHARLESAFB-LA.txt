(1) Object sighted was round in shape and about two size of a nickel held at arms length. The object was white in color rose-blue; a bright light, dimming in intensity and then rising to a bright white again. Only one (1) object was sighted. Speed varied from very fast to almost at app'g. At its slowest up date the object made sharp "zig-zag" turns. At 2120 CRD and was observed for five (5) minutes. (3) Observation was made from Lake Charles AFB ATC tower. (4) Location of observers was 30°12' 93.99'N. Object moved from North to South at an undetermined altitude.

(5) Identifying Personnel - A/2c William L. Huffman Jr. AF-13'375514
A/2c Norman E. Wallace AF-13'388125
AF-16'975 05, all of the 68th Recon Wing Sq at Lake Charles AFB, La.

(6) Weather of clear this station at 2127 CST (77) No meteorological or other conditions reported in the area. (8) No physical evidence of sight sug. (9) Reporting station taken at 0200 hrs. (10) Scene was one (1) L-29 in traffic pattern at Lake Charles AFB which was sighted by observers.

STATEMENT OF FACT

At 2120 CST 6 Oct 1952 we were leaving the dock area of the flight line when we observed a round and shaped white object traveling NE. It got bright then dim, and changed speeds from very fast to almost stop. At the slowest speed it made right angle turns and completed 3 or 4 of these. It was still in sight when we left to report it, but at a much later altitude. Then when we observed it for a total of almost 5 minutes before leaving.
