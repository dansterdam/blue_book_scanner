My wife and were sitting on our front porch when, at the time our given here, this moving light caught the attention of us both. It was moving rapidly in a direction from north to south, it was approximately perpendicular to our as was first observed it (dimly in front of us).

This object flew in this north to south direction for nearly half of our visible horizon, at about four-fifth (4/5) of this distance it began as will turn which when completed was about exactly perpendicular to the original north-south course. It was now headed approximately due east. Then went to east direction was about one-half of magnitude of north-south length of flight.

During our entire observation the object continuously pulsated from yellow to orange to yellow its at a rate of approximately one-hundred as I remember (110) pulsation per minute. Just prior to disappearing

Here is the OCR text from the document:

This object changed color from yellow rapid shine to a brilliant red shown its completely disappeared. We could see all about where the object disappeared and those seemed enough light that it would have been visible. At no time did it make any angle or direction of movement toward the earth nor did it deviate plane or path parallel with the earth.

I should like to note that in one of our local papers there appeared an article stating that many persons in our city now had seen a meteor and that it appeared to explode over the city. For me this object did not in the least resemble any meteor. At no time did it have any definite color of the earth (as of dawn by daylight) and it made a definite 90 degree parallel to the earth, its trail, trail or sphere whatever.

In this report I have attempted to give as clear, concise description of what we saw - I hope it may prove helpful, if anything, in this report complete with my telephone conversation of June 24, 1953 then what I have not done in this bulletin in the most correct, since I have had time to recollect, also this more fully and if my estimate will not place there its only because the thing was difficult to guess about (size, type, speed, shape, etc.)

Again hope to have of some help and if any further information is desired feel free to contact me at any time.

Yours truly,
