UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT REPORT

The time was 18 minutes till 4:00 P.M., Monday, 25 August 1952. I was coming from the stock room to the Draft Room. Just as we made the door toward I looked north of the watch tower, and I noticed two objects in the sky, and it was going too fast. I stopped the truck and took a good look at it, I told it was about three or four times and looked to see what it was it was no balloon because a balloon floats in the air real slow. This thing in the way that thing was going. As I called my pal, and then it pointed its out to him. It was circling the whole area. The thing than a jet and the sun was real low. The thing was going faster than a jet and was silhouetted by the setting sun. The object looked round and flat compared to the body of an army airplane or anything like that.

1. Object appeared to be in round in shape, no lights, or projected light of any source. Object was silver in color, reflected from sun. No sound, no indication of exhaust or propulsion system. When object was first sighted it was headed in a southerly direction, made a 3600 turn and headed north, climbed through a cloud, broke through top of cloud, made another 3500 turn, climbed almost straight up and out of sight. Object appeared faster than jet aircraft.

2. Object was observed at approximately 1510 MST. Observation was for a period of three (3) to five (5) minutes.

3. Observation was visual. No type of optical or electronic equipment was used. A check was made of Rand-Allen, Inc., Laboratory Number 2. Their radar equipment in the process of being set up at the time of the observation.

4. Observers were on Inlasa road leading from the north to the west area, Holloman AFB, New Mexico, see Enclosure number and nine.

5. Mr. Fred Lay, Utilities Operations and Plant Supervisor has worked at Holloman AFB, New Mexico for a period of six (6) years. Mr. Lawrence A. Aguilar, Electrical Installation and Repair Foreman has worked at this base for a period of ten (10) years.

6. Weather at 1530, 25 August 1952

Sea level pressure 1009.3 Temperature 98.1
Dew point 51 Wing East at 9mph
Altimeter setting 30.09 Relative humidity 20%
REMARKS: Rain showers in all quadrants

At 1400 hrs mst a 750 gram rawinsonde balloon ascended, during a period of 72 minutes, up to 90,000 feet. Its descent required about half as much time as it required to ascend and in place of a balloon descending an onlooker would see a parachute and an instrument that went up with the balloon and perhaps some shreds of the balloon. Shreds because the balloon had burst.

The image appears to be a scanned page displaying a map or layout of a facility; however, there are no photographs of any subjects or unidentified flying objects (UFOs) present on this page.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can attempt to extract text from the document, but please be aware the image is of low quality, and some text may not be recognizable accurately due to the image's resolution and clarity. Here's the attempt to transcribe the visible text in the document:

```

The document's condition and the level of detail in the image mean that the full transcription may be incomplete or inaccurate. The text outside of the parentheses is difficult to read, and it is not feasible to provide a full and accurate transcription of that content.
