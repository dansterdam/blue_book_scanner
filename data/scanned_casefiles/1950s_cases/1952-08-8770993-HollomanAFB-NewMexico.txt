UNCLASSIFIED INCIDENT REPORT

The time was 11 minutes til 4:00 P.M., Monday, 25 August 1952. I was making from the east road to the north area. Just as we were coming up the road, I looked north of the tower, and I saw the vapor trail I looked north of the road. I stopped the truck and took a good look at it. I saw it clearly about three or four miles and looked to see what it was. It was a vapor trail, and I called to [redacted], and then I pointed it out. Mr. [redacted] was there. The object looked round and flat compared to the body of an airplane or anything like that.

This image appears to be a detailed architectural or site plan map. The text I can discern includes:

"POST MAP" in the top right corner
"A.E. Levine & Blvd. of Albuquerque" in the bottom right corner

The document is a black and white blueprint-style map showing various buildings, roads, and structures laid out in a complex geometric pattern. Some areas are blacked out or redacted with dark rectangles. The map seems to depict a military or government facility, possibly Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, as suggested by the filename.
