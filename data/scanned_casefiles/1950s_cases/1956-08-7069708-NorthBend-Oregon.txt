6. SOURCE
Military

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
two hours

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
easterly

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Due to the fact that object was tracked by ground radar, no description of the object was given. Object was initially sighted at 320 dgr azimuth at 54,000 ft altitude and appeared to orbit. Object descended to 50,000 ft altitude while moving to 32 dgr azimuth. Object faded from scope after being tracked for two hours.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other:
☒ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

11. COMMENTS
Direction, orbiting, and descending path indicate that the sighting was probably caused by a balloon. In addition, a check with the ADC Forecast Center revealed that a balloon was in the area at the time of sighting. However, due to the fact that the winds at 50,000 ft (as given in initial rpt) do not correlate to the course of the object, evaluation is balloons (probable).
