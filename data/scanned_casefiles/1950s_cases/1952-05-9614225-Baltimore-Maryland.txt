"There was no noticeable sound whatsoever. This seemed strange and because the night was quite still and sounds could be heard from the stadium, which is approximately 20 blocks away.

"We also watched several airliners in the following few minutes. All these planes could be heard and running lights blinked normally.

Original copies of above statement is on file in District Office #4 and will be released upon request by proper authority.

4. Interview of Miss HELEN HAAS, reflects identically the same information as related by BOSSERT.

5. Review of flight records at 29th Infantry Division, Headquarters Battery 224th Field Artillery Battalion, Harbor Field, Baltimore, Maryland, reflects that two (2) L-19 Aircraft, Numbers 51-4543N and 51-12023N, piloted by Captain J. LIMER WEISHERT, JR., 1-440473, and Capt J.K. CADWALADER, J-11857(A), on 27 May 1952 from 2150 to 2250 hours and 2150 to 2250 hours, respectively, were flying in vicinity of sightings of unusual lights by MORRIS and BOSSERT.

6. Interview of WEISHERT reflects that on 27 May 1952, at approximately 2230 to 2240 hours, he and CADWALADER were flying in area described by BOSSERT. CADWALADER was flying behind, and to the right of his and at approximately 2500 feet, cruising speed 100 mph. He related that CADWALADER was flying a little close and to motion him away he went up and to the left and then dropped approximately 1000 feet. CADWALADER went down to the right. Neither plane had its landing lights on, but there is a rather large white navigation light located on the bottom and top of each aircraft which throws a steady light. His plane's red and green navigation lights were not working. His aircraft was an unpainted aluminum. CADWALADER's aircraft was Olive Drab.

After CADWALADER left his area of flying, he was simulating instrument flying over Baltimore for approximately one hour at 2500 feet at cruising speed of 100 mph. During this hour he believed that he flew over western Baltimore, which is the area of the two (2) unusual lights sighted by MORRIS. He described the weather as very clear and dark, with no moon.

7. Official weather report as obtained from Friendship International Airport is as follows:

Weather report from 27 May 1952:
2225 Hours: Clear, visibility 15 miles, surface wind southwest 8.
2327 Hours: Clear, visibility 12 miles, surface wind southwest 3.

8. CADWALADER was not available for interview at this time. He is taking examinations and attending graduation exercises.

1. This investigation was predicated on information received from S/Sgt. WILLIAM SEEDS, LX-22)5762, 104th Fighter Squadron, Harford Field, Charge of Quarters, who stated LEONARD MORRIS, 4617 Reisterstown Road, Baltimore, Maryland, had informed him on 27 May 1952 he had "seen those flying saucers".

AT BALTIMORE, MARYLAND:

2. LEONARD MORRIS, 4617 Reisterstown Road, born 16 August 1922, at Baltimore, Maryland, Education - High School, and Trade School, presently employed with Bendix Radio, Towson, Maryland, was interviewed on 29 May 1952, and stated that on 27 May 1952, between 2230 and 2345 hours, while sitting on his front porch with his wife, two observers what first was believed to be a falling star and immediately decided it was not a star, but a plane traveling at a great rate of speed. This object had two (2) white lights about 100 feet apart and was traveling in an easterly direction, altitude and distance away unknown. The two (2) lights appeared to hover above a "mail plane" (estimated speed 300 miles per hour) and then increased its speed to about five times that of the mail plane and disappeared toward Washington, D.C.

There was no sound from the lights. He later decided that the white lights could not have been a plane since the lights were very round and were not similar to landing lights on aircraft. The distance between the lights did not vary. He observed the lights for a maximum of 10 seconds and did not see any red or green lights. The white lights were a body connected to the lights. "The weather was very clear at the time of observation. - RICHARD BOSSERT, a fellow employee, had observed similar lights on the same night, but in a different part of Baltimore and at an earlier hour.

3. Interview of RICHARD ADAM BOSSERT, 5014 Ivanhoe Avenue, presently employed by Bendix Radio, Towson, Maryland, referred to later on 27 May 1952, between 2230 and 2240 hours, he and his wife and landlady, Miss HELEN HAAS, same address, observed two unusual lights. A statement was obtained from BOSSERT as follows:

"Two large white lights appeared, low in the horizon, in a southeasterly direction. Our first impression was that it was a plane, in trouble; trying to land. The lights looked similar to landing lights of an airliner. At first they appeared to be heading directly for us and only several blocks away (if compared to the size of average airline lights). There were no apparent running (red and green) lights. As I got out of the car, the lights separated, the one on my right dropped to the left and disappeared behind a house. - The light on my right veered upward and to the right and passed behind the second house. - We observed it, as it emerged from behind the house and it moved rather slowly and at times seemed to float and 'bob' as though it were affected by air currents. Then it passed behind a third house, (moving south) and again appeared. It moved steadily southward for apparently several degrees then reversed and retraced its first sighting position, but after it passed behind the last house it was lost from sight. We watched for 15 minutes and never saw it again.

"The appearance was not comparable to anything I could explain. There seemed to be no form or a body, which should have been visible as a silhouette in the clear sky. The lights seemed to have no definite direction as to bearing. The light time was as though a 1000 watt bulb might be hanging in mid-air several blocks away. As the light changed its direction (movement) the appearance still stayed the same - as though it were pointing toward us at all times.
