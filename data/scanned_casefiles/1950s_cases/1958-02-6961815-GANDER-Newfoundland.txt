the same position as yesterday.

26/0443 - Dividend called and asked if we had any more information.
RCMP also called.

26/0502 - 64th PQ called for information on Aircraft Flash from Glenwood.

26/0120 - Called [redacted] for more information.

26/0720B - Dividend called enquiring about how reliable [redacted] was.
RCMP also made the same enquiry.

2    The Detachment Commander made several calls to [redacted] on
25 Feb 58 for additional information on the original sighting and also to obtain
some of his personal past history. [redacted] was recently been released from the
8015 after serving for a period of two years as a General Duties airman. From his
assigned manner on the telephone and his past service experience, a certain amount
of credulity was attached to his observation, and it was felt that a search -
either from the air or by a ground party - might be advisable.

3    Since 72 GObc had received no enquiries from 64th Intelligence
on this reported sighting. The Detachment Commander telephoned Major Thrasher
at 25/0590. Major Thrasher was not aware of the sighting and requested all
pertinent information. He agreed that a ground party should attempt to find the
clearing. [redacted] had reported, and it was decided that a party consisting of
GObc, RCMP and Johnson would go in early in the morning.

4    At 26/1130Z it was learned that a party consisting of RCMP and Eyers
personnel had gone to Glenwood during the night and questioned Johnson, but no
search had been made. Weather prevented the GObc party from starting their trip
on this date.

5    At the request of Lt. Cooper, 64th Intelligence, the GObc - RCMP
party went out on the ground search at 27/1100Z. The party left Glenwood at
14:27 and returned at 20300 without any success. [redacted] was unable to lead the
party to the clearing he claimed he had found on 25 Feb 58.

6    The Detachment Commander interviewed two officials of Bowater's Woods
Department, Glenwood, who have known [redacted] for some time. From their remarks
it was learned that [redacted] was a certain [redacted] who was in the military.
Further, during the search, [redacted] made several enquiries of the
party as to whether this incident would receive any publicity through the radio
or newspapers. His assurance was that he could again find the clearing because
he was sure. He was informed that the incident would probably not receive any
publicity unless 64th Air Div wished it to.

7    [redacted] was not available for interview, but her daughter,
[redacted] was questioned regarding the sighting at 25/0500. She described the
object as a red light in the east traveling towards Gander.
Further enquiries at the place from where the sighting was disclosed that
the light was seen in the vicinity of the Trans Canada Highway. It can very
well be that this light was from the snow plough clearing the roads after the
heavy snowfall in the past two days. It was definitely not the same sighting
as [redacted].


- page 2 -

Further questioning of Flying Officer Miller on the sighting at
25/0602 revealed that, in his opinion, this object was definitely a bright star
with chain colors due to some atmospheric condition prevailing at that time.
The object was sighted as being south-east of Gander, and Miller takes it
apparent that this sighting was also not the same as [redacted]. But the fact
existed, that Eyebrow had four unidentified plots at about that time on an object
approximately at 2000 feet.

Reported two different sightings, the first at 25/4103 and
the second at 26/4052, and the position of both sightings was the same, south
west of Glenwood in the vicinity of an operating Bowaters Wood Camp. It is
not known as yet whether any activity at this camp at those times could have
caused a glow in the sky and made such a strange sighting of an unidentified
object. The clearing presumably found by [redacted] could have been a wood yard
made by a bulldozer prior to the snowfall. Bowaters has a bulldozer in that area
of this camp, but the officials did not know if it had made such a clearing.

The existence of the clearing with freshly broken and uprooted trees
as described by [redacted] cannot be disregarded. The fact that he was unable
to guide the ground party back to it could be due to his lack of knowledge of
the area. His home is in Deer Lake, and he has been away from Newfoundland for
several years. Although quite well known in Glenwood because of relatives there,
he still does not possess intimate knowledge of the terrain. Further ground
search is not recommended because of the snow and bush conditions existing in
the area. For these reasons, it is recommended that a low level search using an
L-20 or a C-47 might disclose the position of the clearing. Aerial photos could
be taken if the clearing is located, and a study of such photos should give a
reasonable explanation for the clearing.

Further, the fact the Eyebrow had four unidentified plots at a height
of 2000 feet about the time of [redacted] sighting adds weight to his report.
Until these plots are definitely identified, it must be assumed that an object
was an object that could be an unidentified flying object.

A map, scale 1:50000, is included as App "B" and shows the route
of the search party and the route presumably taken by [redacted] on his trip in
the clearing.

May the Detachment Commander be advised of any further information
required by your command.

LEGEND (partially visible on right side of map)

The map shows various geographical features with lines, dots, and markings. There is a large oval-shaped area with small dots within it. The map covers a region around Gander Lake in what appears to be Newfoundland, with various grid coordinates marked along the edges.

The map has a legend on the right side, though most of the legend entries are not fully legible. Some partial words can be seen, but not enough to confidently transcribe them.

At 12:40 A.M., 25 February 1958, a call was received from Mr. Alenwood, Newfoundland. He reported the sighting of a disc like object falling from the sky and on fire.

Later during the day Mr. called and stated he had visited the area where the object had touched landed and found a clearing 1/4 mile by 1000 ft, trees freshly broken and uprooted, and snow cleared away in a perfect triangle. The snow was depressed and plowed up at one end. There were no signs of heat or tracks. He also stated that a Mrs. and her daughter of Glenwood had seen a long, red streak in the sky East of Glenwood at 12:00 midnight.

Mrs. was not available for interview, but her daughter, Miss was questioned concerning their sighting. She described the object as a red light in the East travelling toward Gander. A check disclosed the light was seen in the vicinity of the Trans-Canada highway.

There was a snowplow clearing the roads after two days of heavy snowfall, and it is very possible this is what they saw.

While investigating Mr. sighting, a call came in from Flight Officer, Duty Controller of the 226th aircraft control and Warning Squadron, at Gander, NX Newfoundland. He and two other men saw an object on their radar scope on a very erratic course. It disappeared from the scope to the West and they went outside to see if there was anything in the area. Upon further questioning, Flight Officer revealed that, in his opinion, this object was definitely a bright star which appeared to change colors due to the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time.

At 10:45 A.M., 27 February 1958, a ground party left Glenwood with
Mr. [redacted] to locate the clearing he claimed to have found, with no success.

Two officials of the Bowaters' Woods Department, Glenwood, who knew
Mr. [redacted] for some time, were interviewed. It was learned that Mr.
[redacted] has a reputation - to put it mildly - of [redacted]. This
is borne out by the fact that during the search, he made several inquiries
as to whether this incident would receive any publicity. Wehh he was
informed that it probably would not, his assurance that he could find the
clearing again became less vehement.

Further search was not recommended due to the snow and brush
conditions. If the clearing could be located, aerial photos could be
taken and studied.

Because Mr. [redacted] cannot furnish more details or locate the clear-
ing, this is carried as an unknown.
