SUBJECT: Statement of [redacted] On unidentified Airborne     5 November 1952
Object seen and observed October 27th 1952

TO:   Lt. Arthur W.Fyfe
       Chief Munitions Branch
       Dugway Proving Ground

On the Day of 27th October 1952, at 0800, while A companion of the [redacted] Salt Lake City, and I were in the process of deer hunting in the Vicinity of Hickman Canyon. A canyon on the County route between St. John and Granville, Tooele County. We somewhat momentarily started to see, and hear an object flying toward us and about the altitude of 3000 feet, which was immediately and positively identified by my companion Miss [redacted] and myself. As the object called in the part flying Saucers. Miss [redacted] and I followed the object with our eyes until the object seem to fly in the mountain tentatively identified as south mountain and we heard the crash, details are as follows:

While Miss [redacted] and I had separated to work around A knoll, She in A North westerly direction and I in A south westerly direction we had agreed to meet again on the south side of the knoll. Before I had come in to sight of Hickman, I came into her sear this object. I put the telescope I had mounted on an 06 rifle and followed its flight till I saw that it was coming directly for me so I took compass and drew A sight on its flight line, which read 110 Degrees East by proven 290 Degrees West. In A perfectly straight line and descending on about A 15 percent angle from sky to earth. I watched the flight until it seemed to hit in the Mountain called south Mountain and then we heard A terrific crash. But no evidence of an explosion. I checked my compass reading again and directed searching and stayed in the area till three thirty or1530 looking for any additional activity, and saw none.

b. In comparing Miss [redacted] observations with mine for record, She insisted that she heard the object three or four minutes before she saw it and assumed that it was A small -airplane.And also she was fifty yards higher on the knoll than I was where she was the object was from like A saucer with A dark spot in the middle. Although where I was I looked straight up under the craft and can positively state that the object had to or more intake or exhaust pipes sticking out in the same direction that it was traveling, there I was there no indication of spinning while where Miss [redacted] stated she could see it was spinning. To me it was convex on top and concave on the bottom with the smooth lines broken by these pipes sticking out in the forward position. Observation could be guns fire or tubes or exhaust or intake. But at time of observation no activity such as smoke of it would have to be observed. From where Miss [redacted] and myself were, it was or was not definitely spinning. Object was dark grey in color or light brown this was agreed on by both Miss [redacted] and myself. The sound is and was like a car traveling about sixty miles an hour. Or in relation A car window defroster running at high speed.

SUBJECT: Continued statement of [partially obscured text] on unidentified Airbourne object seen and observed October 27th 1952.

After again looking around for unusual activity in the area, I returned to Salt Lake City to try and institute a search without going to much trouble, without any success. I then went A head and did all the research that has been published on the subject of Flying Saucers And drew up maps and area landscape to fix the area. This was in when I sighted the object. I again interviewed Miss [obscured] to verify facts that I wanted to be positive of. and swore her to secrecy until I could clear the facts with personnel at Dugway Proving Grounds. October 28th 1952 I put in a phone call to Lt. Arthur W. Fyfe in regards to getting some kind of help in my search. He was very helpful and offered to try searching with an aircraft from Dugway however I was not sure enough of the names of the Area to direct over the phone and I prevered to start the ground search that I had previously arranged for. However I was instructed to see Mr. Faye Gillette and report what I had seen. But Mr. Gillette was on another case and I talked to an underserif who was not very cooperative so I decided to take people that I knew I could trust and continue the search my self. I went alone and searched the area Tuesday Wed. and friday October 28,29,30. Then made preparations to take more help in the Salt Lake area. The 2nd of November I swore to Secrecy and we continued the search of Toole and Goyernment workers. And Miss [obscured] made an unsuccessful attempt to photograph it. For the registration number at exactly 1400 Afore mentioned people were grouped out about A distance of four miles and all reported hearing the same noise intermittently that Miss [obscured] and I had before and when we sighted the source. But None of us saw any flight of any kind. Noise continued for about five minutes and during that time faded out and came in again. No explanation could be advanced by any of the observers present. The noise was or seemed to be the loudest. Noval sides of south mountain where Miss [obscured] were stationed -ging to photograph what ever it was that seemed to be right over them. However other than the final cessation of the noise nothing developed in talking with Lt. Fyfe and Intelligence I hope to convey the idea that other than airsearch of the area I am sure I can do better without to much out side help until I need them. I will suggest to civil auth- -orities to have myself Deputies for special search detail in that area and so as not to arouse suspicion if we are observed by outsiders.

On the night of 28 October 1952 ground observers reported an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of SHIKANO-SHIMA, 390-19'N, 1300-19'E. One T-94b, Conf 29, was airborne on a local training flight at the time and was instructed to investigate. Two (2) additional T-94b's were scrambled and investigated. Conf 29 previously, on the same flight, observed a bright light in the vicinity of SHIKANO-SHIMA which looked like an "overgrown light bulb". When the three aircraft proceeded to investigate, they found nothing except a bright star. Further details are included in Part II of this report.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 28 October 1952, by
Captain Delmar Lee Dunham, AO 759 200.

Conform 29, an F-94B, was airborne on a Local Flight at 1830I,
28 October 1952, Captain Dunham, Pilot.

Approximately at 1840I, Captain Dunham sighted an object off to
his left. His heading was 350° and he estimated the object to be on
a heading of 285° from HACOM Air Force Base, 29° - 35° N and 130°
- 27' E, about 20 miles out, at 4,500 feet. The speed of the friendly
was 320 knots.

Pilot saw a bright light on a heading of 220° from SHIGANO-SHIMA
OGI, 35° - 41' N and 130° - 19'E, at 4,500 feet. Pilot headed for the
light at 320 knots which was level with his aircraft about 22 miles out.

There were scattered clouds at 4,500 feet. Pilot entered the clouds
and when he emerged the light had disappeared. This took place between
1840 and 1845I.

Pilot could see stars at all times. The light never moved, but
stayed in one spot until he entered the clouds. After the light disappeared the pilot orbital the area for several minutes and could find
no object of any kind. The pilot stated that the light was steady and
appeared to be the same as an aircraft. Lighted beacons were seen
at about 1,000 yards distance. He said it looked like "an overgrown
light bulb." The light was white and there were no aircraft in the area.
There are no towns or villages in that area large enough to be a source
from which the light might have come or reflected on the clouds. Pilot
made no attempt to contact OGI.

At 1905I OGI called Conform 29 and stated there was an unidentified
object on a heading of 050° from SHIGANO-SHIGAOKI 35 miles out. The
friendly was approximately over SHIGANO-SHIMA at this time at 15,000
feet. Pilot acknowledged the message and told OGI he was heading out
050°.

When the pilot came within the approximate area of 35 miles from
SHIGANO-SHIMA he made a complete orbit of 360°. The only thing he
could see was a hazy and a friendly aircraft, Conform Blue, which had
been vectored into the area by OGI. The Pilot then proceeded to 25,000
feet, orbited and found nothing. The star was a 2 o'clock high when on
050°. Conform Blue and Conform 29 had visual contact. Both saw the
same star but nothing else. Due to lack of fuel, Conform 29 landed at
ITAZUKE Air Force Base.

Pilot stated that the star and the first object are not the same.
They were at different locations, different positions and the intensity
was not the same. When the light, the first object was sighted, disappeared, it was just as if you were in a room with an electric light
going out. He claimed this was not an aircraft but an unusual object.
At 27 October 1952.

On the Day of 27th October 1952, at 0800, While A companion of the Name [redacted] who resides at Salt Lake City, and I were in the process of deer hunting in the Vicinity of Hickman Canyon, a canyon on the County route between St. John and Trantsville, Tooele County. was somewhat momentary startled to see and hear an object flying toward us and about the altitude of 3000 feet, which was immediately and positively identified by my companion Miss [redacted] and myself. As the object called in the east Flying Saucers. Miss [redacted] and I followed the object with our eyes until the object seem to fly in the mountain tentatively identified as south mountain and we heard the crash. details are as follows.

While [redacted] and I had separated to work around A knoll, She in a North westerly direction and I in a south westerly direction we had agreed to meet again on the south side of the knoll. Before I had come in to sight of Miss [redacted], I came into her sight because she was higher on the knoll. She shouted for me to look up and I immediately saw this object. I put the telescope I had mounted on 06 rifle and followed its flight till I saw that it was coming directly for me at 90 degrees compass and drew A sight on its flight line, which read 110 Degrees East by proven 270 Degrees West. In a perfectly-straight line and descending on about a 15 percent angle from sky to earth. I watched its flight until I seemed to hit in the Mountain called south Mountain and then we heard a terrific crash. But no evidence of an explosion. I checked my compass reading again and direction bearing and stayed in the area till three thirty or 1530 looking for any additional activity, and saw none.

b. In comparing Miss [redacted] observations with nine for record, She insisted that she heard the object throw or pour some kind of beam at and saw it and assumed that it was a small airplane. And altho she was fifty years higher on the knoll than I was where she was the object was formed like A saucer with a dark spot in the middle. Altho where I was I looked at it from the upper the craft and can positively state that the object had no more intake or exhaust pipes sticking out in the same direction that it was traveling. Where I was there was no illusion or spinning while where Miss [redacted] stood the testified that it was spinning. To me it was convex on top and concave on the smooth lines broken by these pipes sticking out in the forward position. Observation could be pure contact tubes yet exact or intake, but at time of observation no activity such as smoke or vapor was seen. But I could not tell whether it was spinning or not. At least part of it was stationary. From where Miss [redacted] observed it was or part was dark and stationary. The object was dark gray in color or light brown as viewed from my position. The sound is and was like a car traveling about sixty miles an hour. Or in relation A car window defroster running at high speed.

SUBJECT: Continued statement of                                 Unidentified Airborne Object seen
and observed October 27th 1952.

After again looking around for unusual activity in the area, I returned to Salt
Lake City to try and investigate. A search of about around, to my knowledge, threw
success. I then went ahead and did all the research that has been published on the subject
of Flying Saucers and drew up maps and area landscapes to fit the area that I was in when
I sighted the object. I again interviewed Migs and Yost, Capt. Carlin and others who
be positive of, and swore to secrecy until I could clear the facts with personnel
at Dugway Proving Grounds. October 28th 1952 I put in a phone call to Lt. Arthur N. Ryfe
in regards to talking some kind of help in my search. No was very helpful and offered to
try searching with an aircraft from Dugway however I was not sure enough of transverse of
the area to direct over the ground and I preferred to start the ground search that I had
previously arranged for. However I was instructed to see Mr. [redacted] and report
what I had seen. But Mr. [redacted] was on another case and I talked to an undersheriff
who was not very cooperative myself. I decided to take people that I knew I could trust, and
continue the search my self. I went along and searched the area Thursday Wed. and Friday
October 29,30, Then made preparations to take more help in the 1st of November the
2nd of November I swore to secrecy                                 and we continued the search
on house take. Nothing showed until 1330. I light aircraft civilian rating came over the
area was searching and made a half circle and continued in a north westerly direction.
Migs                 made an unsuccessful attempt to photograph it. For the registration number
at exactly 1450 Afore mentioned people were spread out about A distance of four miles and
all were wearing a very bright colored clothing. The light aircraft then landed near Dugway
and when we spotted the danger. But none of us saw or heard anything. Migs continued
to search the area and during that time faded out and came in again. No explanation
could be advanced by any of the observers present. The noise was so loud and seemed
est North West side of south mountain where Migs                 and Migs                 were stationed
in the area. It was so loud that Migs                 and Migs                 did in the colors in preparation of try-
ing to photograph what ever it was that seemed to be right over the area. However other than
the final cessation of the noise nothing developed. In talking with Lt. Ryfe and Intel-
ligence I hope to convey the idea that other than already stated, if no area I am sure I can
do better without to much out side help until I need them. I will suggest to civil auth-
orities to have myself impudiated for special search detail in that area and so as not to
arouse suspicion if we are observed by outsiders.

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object in the air in the vicinity of Uintah Canyon County of Tooele, State of Utah.

To: Air Tech. Intelligence Command
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

SUBJECT:

On Oct 28th 1952 - reported to Lt. A.W. Lyts at Dugway Proving Ground that I and a companion observed this object tentatively identified as a flying saucer. And he turn stated that he relayed the findings to Lt. Kendick the Intelligence officer of that installation. I surrendered to Lt. Kendick the maps and the compass readings and the approximate site of the crash that I had computed and drawn in the area and while I carried on the search of the area, I also surrendered a two page report on the circumstances and the results of our search signed by my companion and myself. With the assurance that it would be forwarded to your offices, I asked permission to write you people and was denied on the grounds that I would have to wit for that installation, Dugway Proving Ground to act. However as of now I am no longer a member or employee of Dugway I feel free in acting upon my own on positive that the object could not get out of the valley without being seen because of the towns and military installations that surround the valley. However the snow has now stopped my investigation for the present time. I was granted permission to search the area from an aircraft based at Dugway which we did without success because the area is so densely covered with cedar. However the other observer and myself are positive that the object has crashed in that area. And I have not finished my search. So with your permission and in regards to Air Force Security. Any information on the subject that you have and can send to me without impairment, the security that is involved will help me in my search. I will continue as soon as the weather breaks and I am confident that I am the close observer that may be the break everyone has been hoping or my information will show the possibility of what has been so well handled and appreciated. Enclosed are copies that were to a sent to you thru channels. Hoping to hear from you by mail. Will I remain.

Sincerely, [signature]

SIRS:

In Oct 28th 1952 - reported to Lt. A. W. Fyfe at Dugway Proving Ground that I and a companion observed this object tentatively identified as a flying saucer. And he then stated that he related the findings to Lt. Bendict the Intelligence officer of that installation. I surrendered to Lt. Bendict the maps and the compass readings and the approximate site of the crash that I had computed and drawn in the area and while I carried on the search of the area, I also surrendered a two page report on the circumstances and the results of our search signed by my companion and myself. With the assurance that it would be forwarded to your offices, I asked permission to write you people and was denied on the grounds that I would have to write for that installation, Dugway Proving Ground to act. However as of now I am no longer a member or employee of Dugway I feel free in acting upon my own and am positive that the object could not get out of the valley without being seen because of the towns and military installations that surround the valley. However the snow has now stopped my investigation for the present time. I was granted permission to search the area from an aircraft based at Dugway which we did without success because the area is so densely covered with cedar. However the other observer and myself are positive that the object has crashed in that area. And I have not finished my search. So with your permission and in regards to Air Force Security, any information on the subject that you have and can forward to me without impairing the security that is involved may tend to help me in my search. I will continue as soon as the weather breaks and I am confident that I am the close observer that may be the break everyone has been hoping for. Any information or future or peculiar flight patterns shapes etc would be very helpful and appreciated. Enclosed are copies that were to be sent to you thru channels, hoping to hear from you shortly will remain.
