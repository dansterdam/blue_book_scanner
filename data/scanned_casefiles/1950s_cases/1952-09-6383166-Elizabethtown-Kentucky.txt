Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional sheets if necessary and give the same side page, if necessary.

Dear as I stated earlier, I reviewed certain discrepencies which were pointed out by what apperas to be an Air Force representative and I must confess that my recollection of the entire incident is rather vague. I do recall the object which I observed approximately 4 years ago and under what we then presumed to be unusual circumstances. However, the details of the incident and my reactions thereto, have become somewhat blurred with the passage of time. I can only recall that the object appeared to be flying at a very high rate of speed and at a high altitude. Its course was erratic and it seemed to have the ability to change direction abruptly. I believe it was of a somewhat irregular shape, possibly disc-like. As to its size, color, and other physical characteristics, I am afraid I cannot now give a very definite or accurate description. My impression at the time was that the object was not an ordinary aircraft, but I cannot now be certain as to its true nature or identity. I regret that I cannot give you a more detailed or precise account of this incident. I realize that this may not be as helpful to you as you might desire, but I trust that you will understand the limitations of my present recollection of something which occurred so long ago.

The object contacted C's car and carried it across the ground for a considerable distance, during which time C claims to have been rendered unconscious. Upon regaining consciousness, C found that the object had apparently deposited his car without damage, and that he was unharmed. However, C says that upon examining his car, he found that various parts of it had apparently been subjected to intense heat, which would indicate that the object emitted some form of energy or radiation capable of affecting metallic substances. This, it seems to me, would be a most interesting and important aspect of the case, and C's claims in this regard should be carefully checked and verified if possible."
