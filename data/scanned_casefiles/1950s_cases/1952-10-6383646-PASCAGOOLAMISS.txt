COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
The Air Intelligence Information Report, dated 29 September 1952, which was not contacted regarding the sighting and investigation of the object observed over Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 6 October 1952. This delay between time of sighting and time of report may account for the excessive time elapse and incompleteness of the present report. The "Toad Blasts" heard by the observers were caused by a broken sound barrier of a jet aircraft.

PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI

As an extremely close object passes over them, two witnesses sighted a round, dull-metallic appearing object. Looking up into the sky, they noticed a bright light approaching and a moment later it passed over them at an estimated altitude of 500 feet. The object was described as about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and shaped like a shallow bowl or saucer with a slight dome on top. As it passed over, it made no sound and did not appear to be rotating. The object was observed for about 20 to 25 seconds before disappearing from sight to the north. Both witnesses were very alarmed and frightened by the experience.

The image appears to contain a photograph or diagram, but it is heavily redacted or obscured. The text at the top indicates it is an excerpt from an old Project Blue Book UFO report, but the image itself does not clearly show any identifiable objects or features. As an OCR system, I will now extract the text from the document:

AT APPROXIMATELY 2230 - 2300 HOURS, 1 OCTOBER 1952, I WAS DRIVING ALONG HIGHWAY 90 ABOUT 5 MILES WEST OF PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI, WHEN I OBSERVED AN EXPLOSION OR LIGHT IN THE SKY TO THE NORTHEAST OF MY GROUND POSITION.
AS THIS SEEMED TO BE QUITE UNUSUAL I STOPPED MY CAR AND WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. DURING THIS TIME IT REMAINED STATIONARY AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 2000 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. IT WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE AND GAVE OFF A BRIGHT LIGHT SIMILAR TO AN ARC WELDER. I COULD SEE NO OUTLINE OR DETAILS OF THE OBJECT ITSELF, ONLY THE LIGHT IT GAVE OFF.
AFTER WATCHING IT FOR ABOUT 3 TO 5 MINUTES IT SUDDENLY MOVED TO THE NORTHEAST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN APPROXIMATELY TWO (2) SECONDS. I HAVE NO WAY OF ESTIMATING THE SPEED BUT IT WAS EXTREMELY FAST.
