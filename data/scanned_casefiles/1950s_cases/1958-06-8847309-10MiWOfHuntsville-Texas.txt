Incl #1:   1958 Delta I (Rocket)

Time:   1022W 2
Position:   30°N,   98.1°W Lg.
Altitude:   208 Km(130 miles)

A discrepancy of approx 3 minutes exist in time between sighting and predicted position. This does not rule out the sighting as being 1958 Delta I since predictions are not too accurate in the perigee portion of the satellite orbit. A difference of 2 to 3 minutes is acceptable in this case. Thus, from the position of the object sighted and the time of sighting, it is concluded that object was the rocket portion of 1958 Delta I (Sputnik III).

The satellite portion of Sputnik III would have been visible in the area near Tucson, Ariz. approximately 30 minutes later (1055W) at an altitude of 133 miles - too far below the horizon from the Huntsville area to be seen.

Both portions of the satellite were travelling in a south to north direction (25° magnetic) at the times reported.
