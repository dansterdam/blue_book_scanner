The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a Project 10073 Record Card from the Project Blue Book archive, which documents a sighting of an oval-shaped object near Huntsville, Texas on 12/10/62.

The text in the document is as follows:

1. DATE: 12/10/62
2. LOCATION: 10 MI W of Huntsville, Texas
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: GCT 12/10/62

Incl #1: 1958 Delta I (Orbits)
Date: 1958 10 8
Time: 1831-1920 Z (3.31 PM - 4.20 PM CST)
Altitude: 208 km.(130 miles) 

At a distance of approximately 30 minutes east of Huntsville, a discrepancy of a reportable incident, in time between sightings and positional points as the vehicle was in the visibility area and the timing of sightings. This discrepancy from the predicted orbit is accidental in this case. There was no fault found with the timing of 1958 Delta 1 (Orbits III).

This is a reliable portion of a sighting which would have been visible in the area near Tuscumbia, Alabama, approximately 30 minutes in advance of the sightings at Huntsville, Alabama - to the east of the horizon.

Both portions of the satellite were trackable and identifiable at the times reported.

* Caution: The average observer UNCLASSIFIED material is inclined to "interpret" indiscriminately. Therefore, analyses and reports under 2-3 minutes, particularly when shuttled, a propellant, lay some uncomplicated interpretation.
