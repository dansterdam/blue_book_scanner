After take big city disappeared to the point, was practically to height some under turning searching for the information, which we thought we could write. While we could not write conditions of low elevation, shine. From visibility calling 3 and 4 mile to the ground to Dr. Kehler.

In my opinion the disappearance of the height interest can. It seemed to move slightly but again it just seemed to disappear, like it melted into the clouds.

Also the Gremium party here color at the northern terminus of the light sand the others buildings at the northern terminus where the trees and some time.

Also the premise of the light in relation to our long formation, it seemed not high to me.

There were no traces of any kind, such as light weight or intervisible in the vicinity of cloud like land terrain.

The image appears to be a diagram showing a spherical projection or grid with various angular measurements. The grid is divided into sections marked with degrees such as 30°, 60°, and 0°. There are two small circular objects at the top of the image. The right side of the diagram contains a textured or shaded area with some numerical notations like 45N, 35N, 25N, etc. The diagram seems to represent some kind of geographical or astronomical projection, with lines radiating from a central point and curved lines indicating different zones or angles.

SUBJECT: Summary Report - Springfield "Blue Light" Incident, 5 Nov 57

TO: ARCHIVE, Lt. Nucler
ARCHIVES

1. Major Cooper and Capt Matsuo, Det. 3, MCSS, WGMTG, were requested
to investigate the incident because of the many inquiries by Dayton, Springfield
and Columbus press and TV representatives. Details and guidance personally provided these officers prior to their departure.

2. Interrogations and investigations disclosed the following:

a. Light observed was from an undetermined, but probably ground
source.

b. Locale is in a hilly area. It was observed that cars on an
"up incline" throw their beams skyward. It has been repeatedly proven
that beams of light under misty or foggy conditions normally have a
peculiar "blue, frosty color" as described by observers.

3. Weather conditions existing in the area at that time: rain, misty,
low clouds, poor visibility and almost "ceiling zero".

4. A number of factories having heat sources and "open type
chimneys" were located less than a mile away, and in direction of the
observers.

5. With regard to the allegations that the janitor at the city hall
reported that a car was parked near the hall, was in the room when police officers _______ and _______ were relating the
incident. He suddenly remarked that "this ignition system and the taxi
next to him went out at the same time" that the officers saw the light.
Major Cooper and Capt Matsuo both stated that the janitor made the statement
on the basis of "suggestions".

6. Dayton, Springfield and Columbus press and TV representatives have
been continuously querying ATIC all day re this incident.

Two Springfield Policemen See Mysterious Light

Reports of a mysterious blue high rate of speed, disappearing in five or 10 seconds.

early morning sky in south Springfield Tuesday prompted officials of the Air Technical Intelligence Service of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to institute an investigation of the sightings.

Two Springfield police officers reported seeing the strange light about 4:50 a.m. Tuesday, a few seconds about 4:50 a.m. Tuesday. Just as they were leaving the Public Utilities building, custodian of the Public Utilities building, and a taxi driver were traveling south on Winterberry st. in police cruiser when they saw in the vicinity of Jack's Cafe a light beam, flashing eastward and extending for a considerable distance to the north and south. There was no noticeable sound.

Blue Light Seen, Motors Stalled, In Springfield

SPRINGFIELD, O., Nov. 5 (AP)—A Springfield motorist reported the engine in his automobile and one in a taxi next to his car stalled at the same time early today just when they saw a "frosty blue" light move over Springfield's South Side.

Julius Rossman, a custodian at the Public building, said he was on his way to work when his auto's engine stopped as a taxi next to his car.

Rossman said he had just looked at a clock and it was 4:50 a.m. He said the other two cars stalling.
