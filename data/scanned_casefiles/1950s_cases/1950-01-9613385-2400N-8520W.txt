1. Observations noted from B-29 aircraft 1725, at 24°50'N - 89°20'W, while flying a course of 006°, time 2235, 12 January 1953: Another object about the same size as the B-29 was observed under the main radar. Objects were noticed by Radar Operator. Aircraft Commander, Navigator and Bombardier. The objects traveled across the scope in approximately 10 to 20 seconds on the 100 mile sweep. The objects appeared to be going about 1600 to 2000 mph, as they covered the large and well defined scope in a very short time. They would go for about 100 miles, turn and come in on the radar scope. 
2. The object was picked up by the scope for about 100 miles, turn and come in on the scope (where it was lost). The total time of observation was approximately 30 minutes, following the aircraft all the time. The radar operator switched ranges on the scope during the incident. 
3. When the object came within 20 miles of the aircraft, it then rapidly disappeared. This disappearance could not be explained by the crew. The aircraft speed at the time of sighting was 10,000 feet, flying straight and level at all times of observation. After altering course no further sightings were made. No VISUAL SIGHTINGS WERE MADE BY THE CREW.

4. The speed of B-29 aircraft 1725 at the time of sighting is not known.
5. Radar was switched to the 80 and 100 mile ranges.
6. First appearance was picked up with a bearing of 330°, moving across 020°, 065°, and 180° bearings at various times. Estimated speed of the object between 2,000 and 3,000 miles per hour.
7. Weather condition during sightings: 2,500 feet. Clear above. 3/10 to 4/10 scattered clouds below at 6,000 feet. Outside air temperature plus 11 C.
