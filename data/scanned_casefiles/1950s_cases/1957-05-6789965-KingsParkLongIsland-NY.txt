In reference to letter from Mr. [REDACTED], dated 25 May 1957, and in accordance with Air Force Regulation 200-2, paragraph 7D, dated 12 August 1954, the following report is hereby submitted. Due to non availability of Air Force Forms 112 and 112A at this station, subject report is forwarded as indicated by the format of paragraph 7D, Air Force Regulation 200-2, dated 12 August 1954.

1. a. (Cigar shaped), ratio of length to width 4:1. 
   b. Length appeared between the size of a nickel and a quarter
      held at arms length.
   c. Silvery color.
   d. One. 
   e. N/A 
   f. None except shape which turned from cigar shape to circular 
      during the last ten seconds of observation during which it 
      steadily diminished.
   g. None.
   h. None noticed, however a running engine and a radio not far
      away would have drowned a substantial amount of noise. A
      jet aircraft which passed over about 40 minutes later was
      heard above the same background noise.
   i. Sunlight twice glinted off the nose for short periods.

2. a. Casual glance by observer, object seemed to be moving so
      slowly that it would stall if it was an aircraft. This
      caused observer to continue observation.
   b. Angle of elevation (60 deg. approximately northeast
   c. Angle of elevation < 75 deg. approximately south.
   d. Object continued on a straight course until the last 10
      seconds of flight when it became round and diminished.
      During last ten seconds of observation the object assumed
      a circular shape and steadily diminished as if climbing
      rapidly.

        If it is assumed that Mr. XXXXXX report is correct, there is
no reasonable explanation for this sighting. The F-102s which operate
from Suffolk County Air Force Base nearby often look like a flying cigar
at a distance. They would have to appear about the size of a pea or
smaller however as the high tail is clearly discernable at closer
distances. Mr. XXXXX served in the Air Force as an aerial gunner

during world war II. His observation that the speed of the object was so low that if it was an aircraft it would stall out, seems to rule out the P-1D2 even if he was mistaken about the apparent size. The winds reported by the weather station at Suffolk were approximately 90 degrees to the reporting direction of the path of the object. This however does not fully rule out the possibility of this being a balloon. M.________ story cannot be fully accurate as to the direction from him to the object. If the balloon traveled the course he claims, he would have had to look almost directly into the sun near the latter part of the object's apparent flight. Mr._______ says however that the sun was in back of him and did not interfere with his view. That being the case the object could have had an easterly course which would correspond with the winds reported. The cigar shape could be accounted for as the shape of the object or the shape of the shadowed portion. The diminishing size and disappearance of the object might be accounted for by a combination of balloon climb, and outbound heading, and the normal decrease in definition as an object goes up-sun on slightly hazy days. The weather balloon from LaGuardia might be in the vicinity at the time reported, or more probable 15 minutes later. This balloon however should have been considerably smaller in size than the object Mr.________ reported.

Northport, Long Island
New York
May 25, 1957
  
Att. Commanding Officer.
Suffolk Airforce Base

Dear Sir:

On May 24th at 10:38 A.M. while working on a high tension line located on Old Northport Rd., Kings Park, I saw an object in the sky over- head which at first I thought to be a Jet Aircraft. After studying the object for a few moments I discovered that it had no wings or tail assembly. I was also impressed by the slowness with. which it tr. . . . led through the sky.


I shouted up to the lineman on the pole to take a look at the object, after a few moments, he located it and I asked him if he could see any wings or tail assembly , his reply was negative. We both watched the object for about a minute and a half , during this time it passed through an angle of 45 degrees. During the last ten seconds of viewing it seemed to be getting smaller and finally disappeared as if it had suddenly gained altitude.

The object was about an inch long with a dimeter of one fourth the length, it was going from north to south and it left no exhaust or vapor trail. About 11 A.M. a box car flew by in the same general area and at 11:20 A.M. a jet flew almost the same course but in the opposite direction.
The other man who saw this object i s          Greenlawn.     
Very              youe
