Three-Sightings
Discs
Return
to Calif.
By United Press
SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 30
—Reports by several persons, including two veteran pilots, of
disk-shaped objects streaking
thru Southern California skies
were under investigation today
by Air Force, Marine Corps and
CAA officials.

Four such objects were reported
to have been seen flying in apparent formation by the three-man
crew of a Northrup Aircraft Co.
plane yesterday afternoon.

A Marine Corps jet fighter pilot
said he chased a fiery object for
nearly 25 miles Wednesday night
before it outdistanced his plane
when he ran low on fuel. At the
same time, control tower operators
at Long Beach Municipal Airport reported they saw an "eerie orange
flame" in the sky.

The two pilots and photographer
in the Northrup plane said they
watched the four disks yesterday
until they disappeared behind a
mysterious mountain peak.

Photographer Jim Wilkinson did
not try to photograph them.

He said two of the disks were
flying above the other two and estimated their altitude at about 20,000 feet.

The Marine pilot failed to identify the "round amber light" he
chased for some time.

The pilot, Maj. Harvey N. Patton
of Salt Lake City, discounted the
possibility that it was a star "because it was not high enough and
was moving."

Edward S. Downs, Civil Aeronautics tower controller at Long Beach
airport, reported "an orange object
resembling a ball of fire" at altitude of several thousand feet near
the airport.

Jet Pilot Chases "Fiery Disc"
Over California Marine Base

SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 29 (UP)—The Marine Corps today used one of its jet fighters last night to chase a "fiery object" in the skies for nearly 25 miles until the plane ran low on fuel and was forced to turn back. The pilot failed to identify the unidentified object but said it definitely was moving and traveled at high speed.

The bright object first was observed at El Toro Marine Air Base near here by a tower operator who said it was about 1,000 feet over the field and moving in a westerly direction.

Maj. Harvey N. Patton of Salt Lake City, Utah, piloting the plane, began chasing the object after observing the disc-shaped object, the tower operator ordered a Marine all-weather jet, lighter which was coming in for a landing to make an investigation.

The pilot reported it was a "round amber light" which resembled jet exhaust or a colored star. "It definitely could not have been a star," Major Patton said, "because it was not high enough and was moving."

The jet chased the object for nearly five minutes but ran low on fuel. When he turned back to the base because it was running low on fuel, Major Patton said that as he turned back he saw the light headed towards Long Beach.

A few minutes later, Edward S. Downs, Civil Aeronautics tower controller at Long Beach airport, spotted what he described as "an orange-colored light" resembling a "ball of fire" at an altitude of several thousand feet near the airport.

Downs said the object was traveling west at high speed and headed out over the ocean, disappearing several minutes later.

CASE #22
29 Jan 53                                     Malibu Beach, California

A newspaper reporter called March AFB Intelligence officer and reported that a Lt. Comir in the Navy with approximately 5,000 hours flying time was flying in a twin-engine beach craft near Malibu Beach at 9,000' altitude on a S course when he observed 4 metallic discs of D-36 size flying in squadron formation in a vertical plane at approximately 20,000'. Speed estimate was 12,000 MPH on a SE course. The objects disappeared in the direction of Riverside, California.

ATIC Comment and Conclusion
Although the pilot was considered to be reliable 4, there was not enough information available to this headquarters for proper analysis. Therefore, our conclusion is insufficient data for evaluation.

Memorandum for Record                                   2 February 1953

On 21 Jan 53, Capt. E. J. Ruppelt contacted the A/I of the 47th Air Division, Norton AFB, California, to inquire about the series of UFO sightings in the area. He stated that the 47th AD had only one sighting that occurred on the 30th of Jan near Palm Springs. Fighters were scrambled but no contact was made. A cross-check with the CAA showed a weather balloon in the area, so it was not reported but was written off as a weather balloon.

The A/I stated that all during the period of these reports, 29, 29, and 30 January, no unidentified radar tracks correlated with the UFO reports.

He knew nothing of the Northrup report except that a newspaper said that the CAA tower at Santa Monica had seen four C-47 a/c in formation close to the time of the sighting. He had no knowledge of the Marine incident at El Toro.
