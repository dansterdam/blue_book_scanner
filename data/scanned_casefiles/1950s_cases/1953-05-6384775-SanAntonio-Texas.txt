Use additional paper if necessary.

The object appeared to be very high - but it appeared too large to be very high. It had 10 or 12 lights around the forward edge in a semi-circular pattern. They were small and a very dull yellow, giving off a very reflection that made the forward shape visible. There appeared to be lights of amber or yellow beneath the hull - but nothing trailing it. It was moving very rapidly in a slightly northwesterly direction and passed almost overhead. There was positively no sound even when it passed directly overhead. There were no other aircraft in the sky visible to me - I could not have failed to detect and found it. I would guess it to have been at least 50 ft. in diameter and moving about 300 miles per hour. It had no wings. I had a good view of it as it passed overhead coming from slightly northwest to northeast. I could see it for at least 30 seconds.

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Here are the comments on the recent batch of materials. A few cases are certainly of considerable interest. Over all, in this batch, Venus counts for only one: 28 January, Stuttgart. Fireballs most probably account for 4 cases; balloons for four and aircraft for three.

Coming to the interesting cases: the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This comes very close to being a security-intelligence matter. I'd certainly like to get more information on this. How about sending a few Form A's to Korea. Actually, this should have been investigated on the spot by Intelligence officers.

Peppermill AFB 2 May. This has some similarities to the old German case. Much fuller report needed and Form A filled out on this.

San Antonio 7 May. This has many similarities to the Lubbock Lights and Form A should certainly be sent if this has been done.

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting would help.

The Miami 20 May green light sighting might have been jets but with the green light sighting, jets should have been traveling north instead of south in order for observer to see green navigational lights. A second time interval also seems too fast. I hope that you can eventually send me more information on these: 20 April Korea; 2 May Peppermill; 7 May San Antonio.

I am enclosing my version of a report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur.

And keep 'em coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently than a larger batch at longer intervals.

Jennie send her regards.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

Air Attaché, Paris, France                   IR-224-54                   PAGE    2   OF    3   PAGES

1. In reply to cable AFOIN Cite A-1414 concerning a device that has the shape
of the Canadian Avro flying saucer, the following information is submitted as additional to that given in cable AFG 653-53 from USAIR Paris, France. This information
is also of high importance to Central Paris France.

2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND ON INVENTOR: The inventor is of Canadian-Italian ancestry although he is now of French naturalization. He is presently employed by the Company of Paris and a cartman and designer. According to
Mr. _______ he is not a table worker and is inclined to be "weatherbrained."

3. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF INVENTION: The inventor claims to have designed and
patented two devices along the lines of a flying saucer when he lived in Italy before
World War II. Sketches of these devices are shown in Inclosure 1 and 2. The inventor claims and says he is able to furnish patent numbers and place of filing for the
devices in Italy. Prior to World War II the inventor made models of his designs and
demonstrated them in Italy, and it is at this time that he claims that the plans for
the devices were stolen from him. He made little further use of his designs until
after the War when pictures of the plans he claims were stolen appeared in several
foreign aeronautical journals. At this time he proposed claims for recognition as the
inventor of the devices and searched the patent files in Italy to support his claims.
Inclosure 1 is a photograph of what was left after a fire in the patent office, of
his original drawings that he made and filed in 1938, and Inclosure 2a and 2b are
photographs of the other devices patented in 1937.

4. PRESENT STATUS OF INVENTION: Since World War II the inventor has built one
model of his flying saucer along the lines of the device indicated in Inclosure 2a
and 2b. The inventor presented this device to the French National Defense Ministry,
who now possess the flying model, and was guaranteed the sum of 2,000,000 Francs for
his device. However, to the present time the French government has not given anything
to the inventor. Prior to the turning over to the French government of the device,
a series of flight tests were conducted to prove the feasibility of the invention.
During these tests the model was officially clocked by French officials at about
1300 km/h although the inventor claims his own independent tests showed a speed of
about 1700 km/h. No further flight tests have been conducted due to the reluctance
of the French officials to release the model, although on two occasions tests have
been planned and then canceled. However, inventor claims that if the French government does not give him the money due him soon, he is going to demand the release of
his model and patent rights assigned to the French government and declare himself a
free agent to deal with anyone interested in his device.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MODEL: The present model is in the hands of the French government in Doua, in Inclosure 3a, and is shown in flight in Inclosures 3b and 3c. The basic design is a saucer shaped hull surrounding a gyro-stabilized inner body. The cockpit is located on the top center and is arranged independently of the outer hull. The entire device is one meter in diameter and approximately 20 centimeters in thickness. It is powered by four small reaction
engines mounted symmetrically about the center axis and located on a line of centers
at about mid-point.

6. METHOD OF OPERATION: The model rests on the ground in a freely rotating
cradle. As the engines are started, the outer hull begins to rotate. When sufficient point the ground controller has no control over the model, but when the model, due to
its high vertical speed, assumes a tangential direction, the ground command system
operator has full control of the model.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Air Attaché, Paris, France                    IR-224-54                    PAGE    3    OF    3    PAGES

7. CONTROL SYSTEM: The control system is centered in the gyro-stabilized platform that forms the inner hull of the device. In this section is a large gyro with its central axis mounted vertically in the body. The lower end of the gyro axis is freed and the upper end is movable. Therefore, by moving the upper and of the gyro axis, it is possible to put the model into any flight attitude desired. Banks up to 460 mph are now possible with the present control system. The control system for the movement of the gyro is at the present time a low frequency radio transmitter and drive, turn and bank.

8. COCKPIT DESIGN: The cockpit is centered on the top of the body directly over the central axis. In its present design the radio receiver for the control system. However, for full scale use, the cockpit will house all necessary flight controls. The cockpit is an oval mound with the outer hull, and contains a device, similar to a weather-vane, which keeps the cockpit always facing into the relative wind.

9. RELATIONSHIP TO A. V. BOE DESIGN: The inventor claims that the designs that he patented in Italy in 1937-38 are very similar, both in general shape and method of stabilization, to the proposed device. He claims the design shown in Inclosure 1 is like the present aircraft that is flying, and that the design depicted in Inclosure 4 is similar to the model he has built and is now in the possession of the French Government.

10. COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER: The inventor has promised this office that when he is able to obtain his model. From the French government or further flight tests, an invitation will be extended. However, he has requested that the identity of the officer be kept secret from the other invitees. The material presented in this report should be forwarded with comments (1) as noted and (2) as the General Partridge has expressed interest in this device.

Unidentified objects sighted by Mr. [redacted] in San Antonio, Texas from 2030 to 2045 hours on the 27th May 1953.

These objects were round and appeared the size of a large star; one appeared larger and seemed to be nearer the ground. There were nine (9) objects sighted and were cream-white in color. Objects appeared as a steady light lasting no more than 30 to 45 seconds. They moved very fast, not faster than a jet.

Two to three thousand feet was their height. If placed they were moving about over thirty (30) seconds. About three of the nine objects sighted flew in a straight line, then changed four or five times, then went straight again. One neighbor is known to have noticed this zig-zagging.

DISAPPEARANCE: The objects had a very brilliant light until just before they disappeared.

ALTITUDE AND DIRECTION TRAVELED: Altitude from 20 to 40,000 feet. Objects traveling from southwest to northeast. They were never near the horizon but were sighted at about a 45 degree angle above horizon and disappeared about the same degrees on the opposite side.

WEATHER: Clear, slight wind from southeast. Observer flew in B-26's during WW II.

UNUSUAL: Eight objects passed over in a chain formation evenly spaced. There were sometimes two or three in sight at once. These eight objects displayed, about three minutes later, returned at a terrific speed over the route previously taken. A ninth object was now coming over the large and turned aside to avoid hitting the network object and made a large circle and followed the ninth object out of sight. This returning object returned at a mean height probably circling San Antonio. It appeared lower than the other objects and much brighter.

Unidentified objects sighted by Mr. H_____________ Drive.
San Antonio, Texas, on 27 May 1953 from 2030 to 2045 hours.

MR. GOODWIN'S STATEMENT:

On Wednesday night, May 27, 1953, at approximately 8:30 p.m., I was
called by my neighbor to come outside. He pointed at some lights which
were moving in the sky as being very unusual. When I observed the first
light I was standing in my front yard and the light was moving from southwest
to northwest. In response to a request from the fact that it was not
quite as white as a star, this object had more of an orange or yellow glow.
It crossed the sky nearly straight line and made no sound and there was no sound to be heard in
the same area. The object seemed to be very high, that is, located
nearly as high as the stars over head. It was traveling at what I would
consider a very fast rate of speed. The light was moving in a
straight line and had no vapor trails, no tails or anything noticeable as
to its shape. A few seconds later my wife noticed another bright light in
the south and placed up this object and followed it as it crossed the sky
toward the northeast. It did not seem to fade away but seemed to just
disappear as the light did not seem to grow dimmer as it got further away.

I went back in the house and approximately 20 minutes later I was
called outside again. At this time I again saw the first and now
a light moving in a northeasterly direction at about the same height as the
other two objects I had seen earlier. This light disappeared shortly after I
noticed it and then my neighbor pointed out another light which he said had
come back and was making a circle and moving back in a northwesterly direction toward
Randolph Field. This light like the other, showed no vapor trails or tails.

Unidentified Objects sighted by Mrs. [redacted] near San Antonio, Texas, on 27 May 1953 from 2030 to 2045 hours.

STATEMENT:

On Wednesday night May 27, 1953, I saw a bright light moving in the sky. It was as brilliant as a star, but had a yellow cast to it. It was very high and seemed to be moving at a great rate of speed. It was not like an airplane or jet. The light was much brighter and didn't seem to grow smaller or dimmer as it moved away. The light never disappeared behind anything.

We saw three lights. The first was just a light. We saw these (3) of these lights going in the same direction, north and one later on the west side which seemed to be circling.

STATEMENT

At about 8:55, May 7, 1953, I was at my residence at San Antonio, Texas. I had just walked out on the front porch and was going to sit on the steps and drink a cup of coffee. I started to take a sip of coffee and as I lifted my eyes I saw a semi-circle of small yellow lights in the southwest sky at about forty-five degrees angle from my vision. These lights were very tiny, like stars and were dull yellow. I got two or three impressions in a split second. At first I thought it was a star constellation but then I noticed the lights moving in unison which made me believe that it was an airplane. I then became convinced that it was not an airplane because there were too many lights and the object appeared to be too big. I walked out on the old hill back to get a better look at it and as I got out there it approached almost overhead. No other aircraft was in the sky, at least within my range of sight or hearing. I got a very good look at the object as it passed overhead. There were eight or ten of these lights spaced at regular intervals towards the front of the object and these lights formed a perfect semi-circle. As it passed overhead, I could see the outline of the object. It was very definitely circular. I could see the underneath shadow of the hill. I would say that the object was as large as a house; at least forty or fifty feet across. It seemed to be very high and yet it was very plainly visible. It was absolutely silent, no sound at all. In fact, that was one of the first things that struck me as being so peculiar, that an aircraft that size could be so absolutely silent and yet make no sound. It was moving in a straight line on a definite course in a north easterly direction. I would estimate the speed to be at least three hundred miles per hour, very much faster than a conventional plane of this size could travel. I had it in view all together at least twenty or thirty seconds. Then I ran through the house and called my wife in hopes that she could see it from the back yard but there is a big mean tree in the back yard blocking the view. By the time we could get a clear view, it had disappeared. Another thing I noticed was that a thin vaper, almost like a cloud, appeared to form under the object. I couldn't see the color of the object itself, I looked dark. However, the forward part of the object was illuminated by the reflection of the lights and if any color could describe it, I would say that it was dark grey.

I certify that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:
