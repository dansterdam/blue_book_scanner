MEMORANDUM FOR UPO FILES

SUBJECT: List of Unidentified Flying Object Reports

1. This refers to six (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover by the 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron, who received them for the U.S. Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa. and filed as "COPY UFO REPORTS."

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1955) for the oldest, to recent (January 1956) for the newest. This delay was necessary to complete the analyses before submitting them to the 4602d AISS.

4. The delay in date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analyses difficult, if not impossible, as preliminary military evaluation made or each and entered in UFO files.
