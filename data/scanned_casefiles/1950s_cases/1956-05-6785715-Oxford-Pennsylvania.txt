MEMORANDUM FOR UFO FILES
SUBJECT: Late Receipt of UFO Reports

1. This is one of six (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover letter by the 4602d AISS, the received them from the OSI. Reference Reports File, * later dated 26 December 1956, subject "OSI UFOB Reports."

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest, to over 7 months for the most recent (August 1956). It appears that the OSI had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reason before submitting them to the 4602d AISS.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis of each and entered in UFO files difficult, if not impossible. A preliminary evaluation made
