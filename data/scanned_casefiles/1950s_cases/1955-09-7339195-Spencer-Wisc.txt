10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round, white, turned bright orange as it disappeared. Appeared to be suspended from balloon. Winds SSW at 25 knots at 5,000ft.

11. COMMENTS
Winds would blow balloon out of sight at low alt reported. Positional data not included. Duration suggestive of astro body. Star Spica at reported time of disappearance, however, it is unlikely that this body would be visible and bright enough to be reported at 1840 local with the sun just on the horizon. Insufficient data for evaluation. Positional data missing.
