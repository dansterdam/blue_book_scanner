AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most form fields are blank]

COMMENTS:
Due to the brevity of sighting (5 seconds), "No delay in the receipt of the preliminary report at this headquarters, and, therefore, the impossibility of investigation turning up any more valuable information, no subsequent investigation was directed. A half-report could possibly have caused the sighting."

700TH AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON (ACA)
MITCHEL AIR FORCE STATION
HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK

16 February 1956

SUBJECT: Report of UFO Sighting Based on Information

On the 14 of February, 1955 at 1715 CST (231N2) was driving north on State Highway 5, five miles north
of Milan, Missouri. Miss observed at a glance or a blinky, metallic object, which compared to be hovering in the air at a very high altitude
and at a very great distance. She immediately called her companion's
attention to the unusual object. Her companion, after
a brief glance returned his attention to his driving and could not give
a description of the object. Miss thought no more of the object
at the time and when arrived at home began thinking of it. She then called the editor of the Green City News and told him of the
incident. Mr. Elmer Morris contacted me on the next day and told me of
this sighting.

The distance between the two sightings was approximately 6-10 miles
with a difference of fifteen minutes in time. (In reference to Mr. )

It is the opinion of the investigating team that the object seen was
one of the balloons (weather) more nearly released.
