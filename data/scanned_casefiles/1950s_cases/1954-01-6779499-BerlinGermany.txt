The following information was extracted from the OSI, HQ USAFE Summary of Positive Intelligence Activities for the Month of January 1954, dated 18 February 1954

"4. Unidentified Flying Object Reported over BERLIN"

"On 8 January 1954, a German resident of the American Sector of BERLIN noted an unidentified object, similar in appearance and size to a full moon, traveling in a straight path from northwest to southeast over the American sector of BERLIN. Time of observation was 2027 hours (local time), and source observed the object for a period of approximately five (5) to seven (7) seconds, at which time it disappeared behind the surrounding buildings. Weather conditions at time of observation were clear sky, a few scattered clouds. Wind at approximately five (5) to ten (10) miles per hour, and temperature 200 to 250F. Source could give no additional aerodynamic features but stated that there was no sign of exhaust trail nor could any sound be heard from the object. The object traveled in a straight line at a constant altitude and speed. Source was unable to estimate altitude of the object but stated that speed of the object appeared to be twice that of a jet fighter aircraft but much slower than the speed of a meteor."
