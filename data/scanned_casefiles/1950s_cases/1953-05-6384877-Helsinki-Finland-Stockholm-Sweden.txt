ATIC DOCUMENT: 121303, Area reported on: FINLAND

Following is a translation of an article which appeared in the Helsinki, Finland, daily paper on 11 May 1953: "Peculiar Phenomenon. A peculiar optical phenomenon was seen in Helsinki at 2350 hour last night. It was a shuttle-shaped greenish white light which passed horizontally through the city in a few seconds. On a nearby airfield 16 was seen to compass the field in a seconds. Similar optical phenomena was observed also in Stockholm, Sweden, at about the same time."

Further reports added to the description of this object. A reliable source stated that at 2047s he observed a greenish light traveling very rapidly through the sky. The distance from the airport, his location, could not be determined but it was observed due west of the tower traveling in a estimated direction of 200°. The altitude could not be estimated, but the angle created by the plane of the earth's surface and a line from the observer to the object was approximately 30°. It was observed for 1 second and then apparently disappeared behind clouds.

ATIC Comment: Appears to be a standard description of a meteor. Dr. Robinson of ATIC has reviewed this sighting and believes it probably was a meteor.
