10. CONCLUSION
AIRCRAFT
Objects were observed over Sweetwater Airport were no radio facilities in the area. Although no conversation was picked up, it is believed that objects were A/C (aircraft) moving in the area, however, a distance of light observation was made.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Ten round ft. w. t. little colored obj. changing formation at intervals of a minute and high. At an estimated altitude of 110 deg. at an estimated altitude of 7500 ft. Objects based under 9' alt traveled over a pilot turned to a/c with 1,300 ft. turn to a/c. Objects were then observed within a slight turn or considerably greater radius than that of the C-47 & lower than first observed. One would say approx 1-10 deg of other turn a/c appeared on heading of approx 300 deg.

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Redacted]
DATE: 12 June 1953

Flying a C-47 at 10,500 feet MSL, I was seated in the right seat parking out the side window. Something passed by between the nose section and right engine below the ship. I took over control and made a step turn to the right. I picked up the objects after approximately 90° turn. They were in a large sweeping right turn and descending. There were approximately 10 of the objects and were in the air in a loose, changing formation.

They appeared roundish in shape and dark in color. As the distance became quite between us and the objects, they turned earlier. As we were turning to the right, the objects were between us and the sun and the sun's rays were reflected off for a few seconds.

- page 10 -

The estimate of the speed of the objects were arrived at by using speed in a step turn at 140 miles per hour and the radius of turn of the objects.

The two other observers were Lt. John Gipple, pilot, flying in the left seat and Lt. Frank White, navigator, standing between Lt. Gipple and myself. They picked up the objects within the my pointing them out.

At all times during the observation, the objects were at a less altitude than we were and were between us and the ground.

As we completed our turn of approximately 360° and resumed our course, the objects blended into the background of hilly country and disappeared from sight on approximately the same heading as we were flying.

Sweetwater, Nevada                                UNCLASSIFIED                12 April 1953

I.      DESCRIPTION

At 1510 hours PST, ten round flat metallic colored objects changing formation traveled at an estimated high rate of speed on a heading of 110° at an estimated altitude of 7,500 ft. No trail, sound, or exhaust were noted. Objects passed under the right nacelle of the observers' C-47 type aircraft, and were observed by the co-pilots. He took control of the C-47(,) and turned the right in a tight 300° turn for a better view of the objects. Objects were then picked up unassisted by two more members of the crew. The objects were observed in a right turn or greater radius that of the C-47(,) and at a lower altitude. The objects were observed for approximately 1200 of their turn, and disappeared on a heading of 300°. Observers were unable to estimate the speed of the objects because of the distance and the objects' large radius of turn.

II.     DISCUSSION

No aircraft were observed in the area and the pilot reported no radio facilities at Sweetwater Airport. No report was made until landing at Stead AFB, Nevada. Weather at the time of sighting was slightly hazy, visibility 30 miles. Although the observers reported seeing no aircraft in the area, it is believed that the objects were aircraft (probably trainers) because of the color, maneuvers, and distance at which they were observed.

III.    CONCLUSION

Possibly aircraft.

19 May 53

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss [redacted] officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method has obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the last report I've seen of an honest to goodness mirage. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.

8 April was a meteor.

The Great Falls, 3 April case was Venus if reported time was in error.

28 March Albrock AFB was probably Venus.
31 March Mooshu, and 30 March Lyle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.

The 8-April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

This brings us to the interesting cases:
25 March Eau Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was the only aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Anything more come in on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as Nocturnal meandering light.

29 March Spooner, "less Duration times neads clicking here. Glad to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular questionnaires should be sent to Lt. Gilette.

Next is the 12 April Stead AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you receive more dope on it. Questionnaires should be sent. I'd like to see Kenzel explain this one! Is there any possibility that these could have been apparently ducks have been eliminated.

As for the 26 March, Equasseur AFB although NL, the data are too contradictory and insufficient. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,

3904th Comp "B", Stead AFB                   3904-1-53                   1       1

1. Crew of C-47 Aircraft #3133 on DVER flight from Long Beach, California
to Stead AFB, Reno, Nevada 12 April 1953 flying at 10,500 feet heading 300
degrees at 140 miles per hour, visually observed approximately ten (10) unidentified objects approximately over Sweetwater Airport (38N-116/12W) heading
approximately 110 degrees at about 7500 feet MSL (composite estimate). Time
of sighting 1510 Pacific Time. Observers were Major Fred G. Padelford, 2nd Lt
Frank B. White, and 2nd Lt John Grice, all assigned to 8th Air Rescue Squadron,
Stead Air Base, Reno, Nevada.

2. Objects passed under right nacelle of C-47 and were observed by
Major Padelford. He took over control of C-47 and turned to right in slight
300 degrees turn to enable better observation of objects. Objects were then
picked up unassisted by the other observers. Objects were observed to be
making a right turn or considerably greater radius than that of the C-47 and
were lower than when first observed. Objects were observed for approximately
120 degrees of their turn and disappeared on heading approximately 300 degrees.

3. Objects were round and flat, estimated size of a flying T-6 aircraft,
metallic in color and in a loose, changing formation. No trail or exhaust
was observed; no sound was heard. Observers were unable to estimate extremely
high speed of objects because of distance and objects large radius of turn.

4. No aircraft were observed in the area and pilot reports no radio
facilities at Sweetwater Airport. No report was made until landing at Stead
AFB, Reno, Nevada.

5. Weather in the area was slightly hazy with scattered clouds and
visibility 30 miles. Winds at 10,500 feet were WSW at 20 knots--turbulence
nil.

COMMENTS:

1. Major Padelford is Flight CO of "A" Flight, 8th ARS and has 13
years' service.

2. It is the opinion of the crew that there were no unusual atmospheric
conditions which could have caused such a sighting.
