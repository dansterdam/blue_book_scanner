The document contains two sketches, not photographs. The first sketch depicts a bare, curved horizon line with an indication for where to mark "A" when the object was first seen and "B" where the object was last seen, but no actual markings are present in the sketch, and "N/A" is written to the right. The second sketch is larger and shows a street view with a person standing in the middle of the road, looking towards the horizon, also with a semi-circular border indicating the field of view. There is a smaller inset sketch in the top right corner of the second drawing showing how to mark "A" and "B" in the main sketch. Again, "N/A" is written to the right of the main sketch.

Here's the text from the document:

Flying a C-47 at 10,000 ft msl, I saw a craft in
the night air hovering out the pilt window. Something
flashed by slower than our craft and not jet engine glow.

90° of turn. They were in a large sweeping right turn
and descending. She—we were approximately 10 [unreadable]

They appeared roundish in shape and dark in color.
As the distance became greater between us and the
object, they turned eastward so and directly to the

other maps were m[unreadable] off for a few seconds.

The estimate of the speed of the objects were
arrived at by our radarscope pip-step track at 1800 miles
per hour and the radius of turn of the objects.

The two other observers were Lt. John ______,
pilot, flying in the left seat and Lt. Frank White,
navigator, standing between Lt. ______ and myself. They
picked up the objects immediately upon being then out.

At all times during the observation, the objects
were at a less altitude than we were and
were between us and the ground.

As we completed our turn of approximately
360° and resumed our course, the object
blended into the background of hilly country
and disappeared from sight on approximately
the same heading as we were flying.

```
Sweetwater, Nevada                               UNCLASSIFIED 12 April 1953

I. DESCRIPTION

At 1510 hours PST, ten round flat metallic colored objects changing forma-
tion traveled at an estimated high rate of speed on a heading of 110° at an
estimated altitude of 7,500 ft. No trail, sound, or exhaust were noted. Objects
passed under the right nacelle of the observer's C-47 type aircraft, and were
observed by the co-pilot. He took control of the C-47, and turned to the right
in a tight 300° turn for a better view of the objects. Objects were then picked
up unassisted by two more members of the crew. The objects were observed in a 
right turn of 30°, the radius then that of the C-47., and at a lower altitude.
The objects were observed for approximately 1200 of their turn, and disappeared
on a heading of 300°. Observers were unable to estimate the speed of the objects
because of the distance and the objects' large radius of turn.

II. DISCUSSION

No aircraft were observed in the area and the pilot reported no radio 
facilities at Sweetwater Airport. No report was made until landing at Stead
AFB, Nevada. Weather at the time of sighting was slightly hazy, visibility
30 miles. Although the observers reported seeing no aircraft in the area, it
is believed that the objects were aircraft (probably trainers) because of the
color, maneuvers, and distance at which they were observed.

III. CONCLUSION

Possibly aircraft.

EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY

19 May 53

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss [redacted] officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method has obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method. 

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 26 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the 1st report I've seen of an honest to goodness mirage. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.
8 April was a meteor.
The Great Falls (3 April) case was Venus if reported time[f] was in error.
28 March Albrook AFB was pr(obably Venus. .
30 March Johnson, and 30 March Layle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.
The 8-April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.
This brings us to the interesting cases:
25 March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Anything more come in on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as Nocturnal meandering light.
29 March Spooner, Wisc! Diurnal motion times need checking here. Hard to believe that object could have gone all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular question[aires] should be sent to Mr. Gillette.
Like wise the 12 April F(o?)t Knox AFB, I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you received more. I hope on it. Questionnaires should be sent. I'd like to see Menzel explain this one! Is there any possibility that these could have been aircraft? Apparently, ducks have been eliminated.
As [crossed out text unintelligible] the 26 March Magusser AFB [?]th NL, the data are [too?] trajec[?] [crossed out text unintelligible]. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to [crossed out text unintelligible] have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

UNCLASSIFIED
3904-1-53

1. Crew of C-47 Aircraft #3193 on DVFR flight from Long Beach, California
to Stead AFB, Reno, Nevada 12 April 1953 flying at 10,500 feet heading 300
degrees at 160 miles per hour, visually observed approximately ten (10) un-
identified objects directly over Sweetwater Airport (33021'11'-119121'15") heading
approximately 150 degrees at about 7500 feet MSL. Observing aircraft made a left
orbit at 1510 Pacific Time. Observers were Major Fred G. Paddleford, 2nd Lt
Frank E. White, and 2nd Lt John Clapper, all assigned to 5th Air Rescue Squadron,
Stead Air Force Base, Reno, Nevada.

2. Objects passed under right nose of C-47 - und; were observed by
Major Paddleford. He took over control of C-47 and turned to right in tight
300 degrees turn to enable better observation of objects. Objects were then
picked up unassisted by two other observers. Objects were observed to be
making a right turn of considerably greater radius than that of the C-47 and
were lower than when first observed. Objects were observed for approximately,
120 degrees of their turn and disappeared on heading approximately 300 degrees.

3. Objects were round and flat, estimated size of a flying T-6 aircraft,
metallic in color and in a loose, changing formation. No trail or exhaust
was observed; no sound was heard. Observers were unable to estimate extremely
high speed of objects because of distance and objects large radius of turn.

4. No air traffic was observed in the area and pilot reports no radio
facilities at Sweetwater Airport. No report was made until landing at Stead
AFB, Reno, Nevada.

5. Weather in the area was slightly hazy with scattered clouds and
visibility 30 miles. Winds at 10,500 feet were WSW at 20 knots—turbulence
nil.

COMMENTS:

1. Major Paddleford is Flight CO of "A" Flight, 8th ARS and has 13
years' service.

2. It is the opinion of the crew that there were no unusual atmospheric
conditions which could have caused such a sighting.
