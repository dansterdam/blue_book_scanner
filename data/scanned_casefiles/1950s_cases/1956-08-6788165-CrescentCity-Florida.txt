Here is the text I can read from the document:

ACTION

Some text appears to be partially illegible or cut off at the edges of the document. There are also various stamps and markings, including one that says "15:26" and another that says "ACTION".


- page 2 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible. There is a partially visible text fragment that reads "FLA. SAUCER" and an object circled in black ink on the left side of the document. The page appears to be from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, but the majority of the text is too faint or blurry to be accurately transcribed.
