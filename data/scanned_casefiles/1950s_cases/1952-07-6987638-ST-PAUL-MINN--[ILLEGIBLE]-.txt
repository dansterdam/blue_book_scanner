The image appears to contain a handwritten document page, but there is no photograph present.

To the naked eye it appeared to be a bright light, like a careening flight of a plane, about as bright as jupiter at present, or less. When the object almost disappeared in the trees in the west, it reappeared briefly for a second or two. The telescope looked like two exhaust flames when he saw it about 1/2 to 20 or 30 seconds. The telescope is a 6 1/2 inch diameter reflector. Type with about a 1/2 inch eyepiece, giving about 95 power. Astronomically, this observation is unusually and so a little difficult to follow exactly right. These 2 seconds is only for a couple of seconds as it passed. We note significantly that at about 11:30 flying in at almost the same speed 2 thought at the time there might have been some great height, varying some.

The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph or image present on this particular page. However, the document contains the following text:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF TWO BRIGHT OBJECTS
AREA REPORTED ON: St. Paul, MN
DATE OF SIGHTING: 6 JUNE 1952
TIME OF SIGHTING: 2330
REFERENCE: GS-313 - St Paul
SUMMARY: Mr. [REDACTED] reports sighting two bright objects earlier on the same night that the 672nd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron tracked strange lights making rapid maneuvers. Mr. [REDACTED] saw the objects at about 2330 hours on 6 June 1952 in the vicinity of St. Paul, Minnesota. The objects were observed to make rapid and erratic movements, maneuvering at high speeds, and changing directions abruptly. The objects were visible for approximately 30-45 minutes. No further details are provided.

- page 8 -

There is no photograph present in this document. The document appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report, containing a detailed description of observed unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

FROM: (Army)
CO., 31st AIR DIVISION
REPORT NO: FR-S-53-C

DESCRIPTIONS:
Two bright objects of light were seen, about as bright as Jupiter's (about 1). They appeared to be about the size of a star, possibly a little larger. They remained stationary and seemed to exhibit no discernible motion, except for having a slight flickering or pulsing of the light constant in color (reddish-white) and intensity at all positions.
First Objects: Observed what appeared to be two exhaust flames about the size of a match head.
Maneuvers and Speeds:
First Objects: Appeared in the South, moved almost overhead about one o'clock in about 20 to 25 seconds and held this altitude.
Second Objects: It was in view from SE to SW for about twenty seconds.
Sounds:
Both were silent, although we heard a faint distant sound for about two seconds, like a jet or perhaps a diesel locomotive, during the second sighting. The duration of sightings:
First Object - About 28/2330 CST
Second Object - About 30/2300 CST
Duration of sightings: About 30 seconds each time.
Manner of observation:
First Objects: It was visible through the telescope for a couple of seconds before it passed out of sight. The time of flight coincided with our time of sight.
Second Objects: Usually, by naked eye and also by telescope. Occasional intervals of about 1 to 2 minutes, until sightings faded from view.
Location of Observers: St. Paul, Minnesota.

AF FORM 112--PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO: IR-S-52-C

LOCATION OF OBJECTS IN RELATION TO OBSERVER:
First Objects: Appeared in the southwest, disappeared in the west or WSW.
Second Objects: It was in the same general direction as the first, but more to the southeast. Altitude about 10,000 feet.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF OBSERVER:
Mr. --------, St Paul S, Minnesota. No more information.

POSSIBLE EXPLANATION:
He suggests that some of the objects later picked up on the radar might be the same objects that he observed and reported. According to the information shown here, only his visual observation is reported on this form.
