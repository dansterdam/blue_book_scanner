To the naked eye it appeared to be a bright, bright light like a landing light of a plane, almost as bright as Jupiter out present, or less. When it was almost in the trees - the west - I picked it up briefly; for a second or two, in the telescope, and it looked like two exhaust flames about 1/2 to 1° or so apart.

The telescope is a 4.85" focal length, reflector-type, with about a 1/2" to inch supplied, giving about 95 power, astronomically mounted, and so a little difficult to follow such a swiftly moving object. Thus, I saw it only for a couple of seconds as it moved away from us. [partially illegible]

We were signaling with another light in the south at about 20° flying W at about the same speed - I thought at the time these might have been jets with my engine units, or at some great height, but there were no jets up that night, according to reports.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

AREA REPORTED: Minneapolis-St Paul    FROM (Group): 6B, 31st Air Division
DATE OF REPORT: 9 August 1952         DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 28 July 1952
PREPARED BY: W. L. Hoy, 2nd Lt, USAF   SOURCE: Mr. [REDACTED]
REFERENCES: Reports of the same night (6 a later hour) from the 109th F-51 Sq and the 67th ACS

SUMMARY:
Mr. [REDACTED] reports sighting two bright objects earlier on the same night that the 67th ACS Squadron observed strange sights on its radar and the 109th scrambled 8 F-51 to investigate these radar sightings. Mr. [REDACTED] used a telescope to sight the objects. He suggests that some of the objects picked up later on radar might be meteors, which were previously predicted.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency)

JR-5-53-C

PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES

Description:
Two bright objects of a magnitude between Mars and Jupiter's (about).
They remained in hearing light at a place, though no beam visible, one
could observe as a red or green light. The lights remained constant in
color (orange-white) and intensity at all positions.

First Object: Observer noticed what appeared to be two exhaust flames
about 1° plus (apparent) apart.

Maneuver and Speed:
First Object: Appeared in the South, moved almost overhead about one
o'clock high, curved to the West or WNW at about 20° plus
per second or about 30° in 10 to 15 seconds and held this
speed during the entire 15 to 20 seconds visible.

Second Object: It was in view from SE to SW for about twenty seconds.

Sounds:
Both were silent, although we heard a faint distant sound for about two seconds,
like a jet motor or perhaps a diesel locomotive, during the second sighting. The
direction of this sound source was undeterminable.

Time of Sightings:
First Object - About 28/2130 CST
Second Object - About 29/2300 CST

Duration of sightings:
About 15 seconds total time.

First Object: It was visible through the telescope for a complete seconds
when the line of flight coincided with our line of sight.

Manner of Observation:
First Object: Visually, by naked eye and also by telescope. Newtonian
telescope used at 16.49 P.M., 6° aperture, using about
a 1/2" eyepiece, thus giving over 90 magnifications.

Second Object: Visually, by naked eye only.

Location of Observers:
St. Paul, Minnesota
