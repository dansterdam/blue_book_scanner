10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
1. Ten 10-inch green objects similar to birds in shape and the size of a faded, objs were observed visually for approx ten seconds.

2. 20-30 bluish green round objs size of a matchhead at arm's length. Objs at first formed a spread V formation, then into a tighter V formation. Objs came out of clouds, moved on a straight & level flight path NE to SW at speed faster than jet. Objs disappeared into hazy clouds after having been seen eight seconds.

11. COMMENTS
Description, size and shape of objects indicate sighting caused by a flight of migratory birds.
