SAW A FLYING SAUCER

This section of FLYING SAUCERS is devoted to factual reports by our readers. Here you will find the personal encounter of those who have actually seen flying saucers, and here, if you are one of these lucky ones, is the place for you to tell your own story! If you have had any sort of "saucer" experience, please send it to us typed and we will print it.

The first saucer I saw was in the early part of August, 1954. I was driving Mars (as it was called) when a friend who was with me noticed something. Then, in the sky, Alabama, I first called his attention to them, and I raised away from my telescope. The first few minutes I was nothing. Then I saw the flashes. I know when I saw them off as lightning. I passed them off as lightning and turned to go back to my telescope. I happened to glance up, and there I saw a bright white boundless gliding toward the farm house. I called both other hands, and they saw it. Then as if it was a show to catch the watch for about ten minutes and then I heard over the radio a factory building in the country. There I saw everything slow- ly. I saw a huge, round, dark object hovering over the factory was a good disk, about three hundred feet in diameter. It was huge. Its size gave everything the appearance of moving very slowly. About ten seconds it shot off to about ten miles and disappeared over the hill. Gully Creek ridge was the place at this time. The other two watched, as they were my first witnesses, as they were my first-

there's hired help. The third remained with me, and saw the second saucer. We know that we were not seeing things, because we both told each other what we had seen and our descriptions tallied.

People afterward told us we had seen a searchlight beam, a reflection on the clouds, a low airplane, a dirigible, or a plane. But it made no sound as a plane or dirigible would, it moved too fast for a balloon, and there were no clouds that evening, so a reflection could not have taken place. I know, positively, that this was a real flying object. It had no come.

The local paper carried out story the next day, and ever since I have been ridiculed. Called "Saucer Boy" and other names. I do not care. I know what I saw. I have since seen saucers on many occasions and always silent, flying objects.

One day at my work was hanging clothes on a line, and I saw a shining disc hovering above the line. She and old around the house screaming for someone to come and see, but of that moment I have a witness, but of this moment remotely controlled disc, and positively saw it. She was excited and saw signs of same. She was not scared, only wanted someone to confirm her action.

No. Case (Information Only)                                 1 August 1956
                                                        Greenfield, Massachusetts

Case 180, Greenfield, Mass., Aug. 1, 1956—The following report is related by its investigator, Rev. Albert Baller:
"Mr. George Kendrick woke at about 2 a.m. From his bed he could see through a window to the East. His attention was drawn to an extremely bright orange 'star' of enormous size which hung above the degrees above the horizon. He awakened Mrs. Kendrick who went outdoors to get an unobstructed view of it. She gives its apparent size as 'about half the size of the full moon' and its color a 'deep orange.' Not noticed at first, but later in her two hours of observation, was a 'narrow, rope-like beam of light' which emerged from one side of the disc and extended vertically for 'considerable distance'. Also, after watching this object for a short while she noted another object (not clearly visible at first, because of the brilliance of the object No. 1) which was a short distance in front of the disc and of a dull, silver color. Also, this second object, which looked 'like a large silver pentagon standing on end,' showed a rather irregular contour and its edges were not sharply defined as with the disc. After watching this spectacle for a time, Mrs. Kendrick reports that a new development took place. Suddenly the bright orange disc began to 'split out into white stars' which began to fly away with no obvious pattern, sometimes one alone, sometimes two or three together in a 'crazy series of maneuvers.' She counted them as they appeared and found that there were eight. When Mrs. Kendrick looked again at the disc at about 4 a.m., these smaller star-like objects were no longer apparent."

REPORT OF U.F.O. SIGHTING BY MR. AND MRS. [REDACTED] OF BROOKSIDE KNOLL, (GREENFIELD), MASS.

(Experience related to me-- Albert Haller-- by Mrs. George (Jeanne) Kendrick.)

Mr. K. awoke at about 2 a.m. Wednesday, August 1. From his bed he could see through window to the East. His attention was drawn to an extremely bright, orange "star" of enormous size which hung about 10 degrees above horizon and almost due N.E. He awakened Mrs. K. who was so impressed by this strange sight that she was unable to get an unobstructed view of it. Because it was so large and so bright, she remained awake from 2 until 4 a.m. watching it. She gives its apparent size as "about half the size of the full moon", but much more brilliant with its "star", deep orange color. Not noticed at first, but later in her two hours of observation, was a "narrow, rope-like beam of light" which emerged from one side of the disc and extended vertically for "considerable" distance (see illustration). Also, after watching this object for a short while, she noted another object (not clearly visible at first, because of the brilliant light of object #1) which was a short distance in front of the disc and of a dull, silver color. Also, this second object, which looked "like a large silver peanut, standing on end", showed a rather irregular contour and its edges were not sharply defined as with the disc. (See illustration)

After watching this spectacle for a time, Mrs. K. reports that a new development took place. Suddenly the bright, orange disc began to "split into many white strands" which began to fly over Greenfield. They flew with no obvious pattern... sometimes one alone, sometimes two or three together in a "completely crazy series of maneuvers". She could not say as they appeared and flew whether they were star-like, smaller, disc-like objects. When Mrs. K. took a final look at the disc at 4 a.m. these smaller, star-like objects were no longer apparent.

Mrs. K. retired at 4 a.m. with the objects still there, but she realized that it was moving with the area* as line passed. Then she noticed it had moved from about 10 degrees above N.E. to approximately 25 degrees and appeared to be shifting from N.E. to E.

At 7:30 a.m. Mrs. K. looked again and saw the disc, now at about 50 degrees above the E. horizon and appearing as a silver disc. She did not watch to observe when or how it finally disappeared. However, the following morning at 2 a.m. she again appeared at the same place, and again on the third morning at the same time. She did not check to see if it was there on Saturday or Sunday morning, but I did check last night (as 3 a.m. Monday) and saw while watching the usual pattern of stars.

Albert H. Haller,
Greenfield, Mass.
(August 6, 1956)

NOTE: The illustration above is a carbon copy of an original by Mrs. Kendrick. She says that on each of the three nights... or early mornings... she observed this unusual phenomenon. The day was clear and the moon bright.

                        Plane Firm Tests
                       "Flying Saucer"

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., Aug. 8--(UP)--The United States' first official "flying saucer," a plane with a huge, disc-shaped structure spreading over it like a parasol, underwent its first flight test today with "definite success."

The plane, built by Lockheed Aircraft, was described as resembling a huge parasol that has been turned into an airplane. It was built for the Navy to test advanced ideas in flying radar stations.

The new "flying saucer" craft is a Navy WV-2 Super Constellation, powered with four turboconstant engines. Its overhead disc structure, more than 50 feet across, actually is a raydome that houses a distance-determining radar antenna.

No Case (Information Only)

8 August 1956
Durango, Colorado

Case 184, Durango, Colo., Aug. 8, 1956—A Durango weatherman, Malcolm Dayton, who watched a mysterious object for nearly an hour through powerful binoculars, described it as a bluish-red, football-like craft which finally left the scene at phenomenal speed. "Whatever it was", said Dayton to the Rocky Mountain News, "—it was nothing of any natural phenomenon." Dayton said the object—shaped like a football with one side pushed in—gave off a constant blue-red radiation and was occasionally observed by a trained meteorological observer. After changing position several times the device moved away swiftly, "going completely out of range in four or five seconds." Said the weatherman, "From its movements it seemed to be controlled."

Case 181, East Hartford, Conn., Aug. 8, 1956—Five objects emanating a pinkish glow in the sky between 9:30 and 10:10 pm. were reported by Mrs. Mary Calaci to the local press. She said that she and three others watched the unidentified objects from her lawn. One was headed north, one northeast, one south and one west. Another object followed the one heading west with a flashing white light. All objects appeared round, she said.

Another object was seen by a retired city fireman, who said that he saw an "oblong aluminum-colored" object about 8 pm. He said that it appeared to be going at least four times as fast as any jet plane he had ever seen. "It wasn't a plane, I'm sure of that" he said. "And yet it wasn't a reflection. It was a solid, with a sort of smoky crown around it."
