No. Case (Information Only)	
Case 180, Greenfield, Mass, Aug. 1, 1956.—The follow-
ing report is related by its investigator, Rev. Albert Baller:
"Mr. George Kendrick awoke at about 2 a.m. From his
bed he could see through a window to the East. His at-
tention was drawn to an extremely bright orange ‘star’ of
enormous size which hung about 10 degrees above the
horizon. He awakened Mrs. Kendrick who went outdoors
to get an unobstructed view of it. She gives its apparent
size as ‘about half the size of the full moon’ and its color
‘a deep orange.’ Not noticed at first, but later in her two
hours of observation, was a ‘narrow, rope-like beam of
light’ which emerged from one side of the disc and ex-
tended vertically for ‘considerable distance’. Also, after
watching this object for a short while she noted another
object (not clearly visible at first, because of the brilliance
of object No. 1) which was a short distance in front of
the disc and of a dull, silver color. Also, this second ob-
ject, which looked ‘like a large silver peanut standing on
end’, showed a rather irregular contour and its edges
were not sharply defined as with the disc. After watching
this spectacle for a time, Mrs. Kendrick reports that a
new development took place. Suddenly the bright orange
disc began to ‘spit out tiny white stars’ which began to
fly every which way over Greenfield. They flew with no
obvious pattern, sometimes one alone, sometimes two or
three together in a ‘crazy series of maneuvers’. She
counted them as they appeared and found that there were
eight. When Mrs. Kendrick looked again at the disc
at about 4 a.m. these smaller star-like objects were no
longer apparent."

REPORT OF U.F.O. SIGHTING BY MR. AND MRS. XXXXXXXXXXX OF BROOKSIDE KNOLL,
GREENFIELD, MASS.:
(Experience related to Mr.- Albert Ballon- by Mrs. George (Jeanne) Kendrick:)
Mr. L. awoke at about 2 a.m. Wednesday, August 1. From his bed he could see
through window to the East. His attention was drawn to an extremely bright,
orange "star" of enormous size which hung about 10 degrees above horizon and
almost due N.E. He wakened Mrs. L. who was so impressed by this strange sight
that she went outdoors to get an unobstructed view of it. Because it was so
large and so bright, she remained awake from 2 until 4 a.m. watching it ... She
gives the object's size as being about half the size of the full moon, but much
more brilliant with "deep, deep orange color". Not noticed at first, but later
in her two hours of observation, was a narrow, rope-like beam of light which
emerged from one side of the disc and extended vertically for "considerably
distance" (See Illustration). Also, after watching this object for a short
While, she noted another object (not clearly visible at first, because of the
brilliant light of object #1) which was a short distance in front of the disc
and of a dull, silver color. Also,this second object, which looked "like a
large silver peanut, standing on end", showed a rather irregular contour and
its edges were not sharply defined as with the disc. (See illustration.)
After watching this spectacle for a time, Mrs. L. reports that a new develop-
ment took place. Suddenly the bright, orange disc began to "spit out tiny,
White stars" which began to drift away very slowly over Greenfield and the con-
necticut River valley. They drifted with no obvious pattern, sometimes alone,
sometimes two or three together in a "completely crazy, aimless manner."
She counted them as they appeared and found that there were eight of these
smaller, stea=-like objects. When Mr. L. took a final look at the disc at
4 a.m., these smaller, star-like objects were no longer apparent.
Mrs. L. retired at 4 a.m. with the object still there, but she realized that
it was "moving with the stars" as time passed. When she retired it had moved
from about 10 degrees above the N.E. horizon to approximately 25 degrees and
appeared to be shifting from N.E. to E.
At 7:30 a.m. Mrs. L. looked again and saw the disc, now at about 30 degrees to
above the N. horizon and appearing as a silver disc. She did not watch to
observe when or how it finally disappeared. However, the following morning
at 2 a.m. o'clock it appeared again in the same place, and again on two
third morning at the same time. She did not check to see if it was there on
Saturday or Sunday mornings, but I did check last night ) (at 3 a.m. Monday)
and saw nothing aside from the usual pattern of stars.

Greenfield, Mass.

She says this is much as the object appeared . My only comment is that whenever I hav$
observed the unusual phenomenon, the sky was clear and the moor

Plane Firm Tests
"Flying Saucer"

      EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
Calif., Aug. 8—(UP)—The United
States' first official "flying sau-
cer," a plane with a huge, discus-
shaped structure spreading over it
like a parasol, underwent its first
flight test today with "definite
success."
      The plane, built by Lockheed
Aircraft, was described as resem-
bling a flying saucer that has cap-
tured 50 airplane. It was built
for the Navy to test advanced
ideas in flying radar stations.
      The new "flying flapjack" craft 
is a Navy WV-2 Super Con-
stellation powered by four turbo-com-
pound piston engines. Its overhead 
disc, measuring more than 30 feet 
across, actually is a radome that 
houses distance-determining radar
antennas.

No Case (Information Only)

8 August 1956
Durango, Colorado

Case 184, Durango, Colo. Aug. 8, 1956—A Durango weatherman, Malcolm Dayton, who watched a mysterious object for nearly an hour through powerful binoculars, described it as a bluish-red, football-like craft which finally left the scene at phenomenal speed. "Whatever it was," said Dayton to the Rocky Mountain News, "it was nothing of any natural phenomenon." Dayton said the object—shaped like a football with one side pushed in"—gave off a constant blue-red radiation and was occasionally obscured by a steamlike haze. After changing position several times the device moved away swiftly, going completely out of range in four or five seconds. Said the weatherman, "from its movements it seemed to be controlled."

No Case (Information Only)
3 August 1956
East Hartford, Connecticut

Case 181, East Hartford, Conn., Aug. 8, 1956 — Five
objects emanating a pinkish glow in the sky between
9:30 and 10:10 p.m. were reported by Mrs. Mary Calac*
to the local press. She said that she and three others
watched the unidentified objects from her lawn. One was
headed north, one northeast, one south and one west.
Another object followed the one heading west with a
flashing white light. All objects appeared round, she said.
Another object was seen by a retired city fireman, who
said that he saw an “oblong aluminum-colored” object
about 8 p.m. He said that it appeared to be going at
least four times as fast as any jet plane he had ever seen.
"It wasn't a plane, I'm sure of that” he said, "And yet it
wasn't a reflection. It was a solid, with a sort of a smoky
crown around it?”
