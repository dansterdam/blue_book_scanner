COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. After reviewing the facts a positive identification cannot be made, however the information available does not preclude the possibility of this sighting being astronomical phenomena.

SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. The 635th AC&W So at McChord AFB was unable to furnish any information on the sighting.

2. There are no facilities available to Flight 1-A for checking on astronomical data.

3. A check with Sandpoint NAS at Seattle, Washington, the only agency in this area that launches balloons, revealed that no such object from their station released at 04/0231Z Sept 1955 could have been in the Bellingham area because prevailing winds were from the north and would have put the balloon far to the south of the sighting.
