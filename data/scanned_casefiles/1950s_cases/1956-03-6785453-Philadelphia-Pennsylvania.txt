CITIZEN OVER CINCINNATI REPORTS 45 MINUTES PHOTOGRAPHED OBJECTS 
AT APPARENT ALTITUDE OF 7000-8000 FEET, AT SPEED 100-125 MPH, FLYING SINGLY AND IN FORMATION OVER CITY. OBSERVER WATCHED FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES THROUGH 8 X 60 BINOCULARS. ONE OBJECT WAS UNUSUALLY BRIGHT, RESEMBLING BURNING MAGNESIUM. OBSERVER HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN OBSERVATION OF AVIATION PHENOMENA. PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED AS YET. WE ARE IMPAIRING THE RESULTS FOR WHAT THEY ARE WORTH. AS THIS WAS A CIVILIAN REPORT, NO INVESTIGATION BEYOND SECURING THE PHOTOGRAPHS HAS BEEN MADE.

"OBSERVATIONS OF VENUS 19-24 MARCH

"It's Only Star, Folks!"

"'Thing' Is Identified From Plane Window

"We chased it then and identified it as a 48 shiny, flying object with some fantastic stories attached to it.

"Captain William T. Dunn, USAF, Langley Air Force Base, Va., an experienced pilot, said he was flying a T-33 trainer from Cincinnati to New Boston, Ohio, at about 12,000 feet when he and his student pilot spotted an unidentified flying object through the pilot's windshield at about 3:00 p.m. on March 19.

"Dunn said the object appeared to be ova-shaped, shiny, and metallic, and was moving slowly compared to the speed of his aircraft. The object was some distance away and seemed to be at about the same altitude as the T-33, Dunn estimated. 

"He said he at first thought it might be a weather balloon, but ruled that out when the object changed course sharply and accelerated to a high speed, disappearing from sight in a few seconds. Dunn said he had a good look at the object through the windshield and was certain it was not a balloon or any conventional aircraft.

"The captain said he and the student pilot immediately reported the sighting to operations at the Cincinnati Astronomical Society, where it was received with considerable interest. Capt. Dunn said the Cincinnati Astronomical Society later reported that they had received several other reports of unidentified flying objects seen in the Cincinnati area that same afternoon."

Output of the text found in the document:

During the spring of 1956 Venus stimulated an unusual amount of flying-saucer excitement. About 9:30 E.S.T. on the nights of March 20 and 22, thousands of persons in Cincinnati, Ohio, telephoned the newspapers and the local headquarters of Civilian Research Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO), to report seeing objects "like a beacon" in the western sky. A reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer stated: "To the naked eye, the object appeared to be an extraordinary luminous blush white light . . . through binoculars, the object appeared to be a compact slowly of lights, changing form as they revolved slowly. At one point, with binoculars just slightly out of focus, it seemed the appearance of a diamond-shaped object with a jewel-like turning lazily on an eccentric axis." The object was visible for nearly an hour, and although only one object was identified as Venus. To the saucer enthusiasts, however, it appeared as a low-flying luminous object with swift back-wings. Hovering in the west, ascending, and displaying colors that changed from red to white. While admitting that some of the reported sightings might have been Venus, the editor of Orbit (the official publication of CRIFO) argued that the changed shape and sparkled like diamonds and asteroids would not possibly be Venus. He stated "that the published shape had now been seen out of thousands UFOS reports, verified for the first time, and it was not Venus but its were not These stubborn six defied all conventional explanation." [6] Although these scientific-looking reports require further explanation, the flying saucer reports did not offer a real puzzle. The time, the position, the colors, and the apparent motions of the object were entirely consistent with those expected for the planet Venus under the prevailing atmospheric conditions. Dr. Paul Herget of the Cincinnati Observatory had easily identified the "mysterious" object. He added that Venus would continue to get brighter and brighter until the middle of May, and the number of UFOs sighted would probably increase correspondingly. He was right: Less than three weeks after the excitement in Cincinnati, Venus inspired one of the most notorious "Unknowns" in the history of saucerdom, one that evoked charges of fraud, falsehood, and conspiracy on a grand scale.

22 MARCH 1956
LANSING, MICHIGAN

SEE SAUCER FROM ONLY TEN FEET AWAY: A laboratory technician named James Bassette, a resident of Lansing, Michigan, claims to have seen a "flying saucer" from a distance of only ten feet while walking along the Sycamore River. He reports that it was hovering about four feet above the ground on the edge of the Grand River, near the Waverly Road bridge. His attention was drawn to a "tiny object" which appeared to be tumbling or rotating. As he approached it, the object rose up from the ground and came down upon him at an angle. He was an average-sized man but he said the object appeared to be at least eight feet in diameter and was shaped like a flattened bowl. It made no sound and as it came toward him, it seemed to be luminous. He estimated it was about four feet in diameter. He said he became frightened and hurried away. He ran about four feet from where he first observed the object and heard about four faint ticking sounds coming from the direction of the object, but all contact or experience ended as he rushed about 25 yards from the scene. He claims the object then silently moved away and disappeared.

"Mrs. 10-2-1918, ----- police reported to police that she was walking along a street in Solma, Ca. she saw a bright light in the sky, and it seemed to be getting bigger and closer. She said it appeared to be a flat, round, silver object which she estimated to be about 30-35 feet in diameter. It passed directly over her at an estimated altitude of 500-600 feet. As it passed over her head, it appeared to emit a shower of sparks. The object then gained altitude and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction."

A description to investigator at time of occurrence.

The report indicates that an unidentified aircraft or object was observed flying over the area for approximately 30 minutes. The object was estimated to be at an altitude between 500-1000 feet, traveling from southwest to northeast at a speed of 150-200 mph. No sound was reported from the object. This appears to be a witness account or investigation report related to a UFO sighting.

The clear night, calm sea. The object was a lighted round mass about twice the size of a 1 moon - had uneven, flickering light and a long tail, 10 to 15 times the diameter of the object, pointing north. Object moved in horizontal direction, dipped down, then arced back up. It was airborne for about 30 seconds. Witness was an experienced observer and has observed the planets and known aerial phenomena. This is an unusual report which deserves further investigation.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER HONOLULU (Story Page Seven.)

YOUR LETTER AND PHOTOGRAPHS - On Monday, March 5, 1956, William L. Bosshardt, Naval Air Station, Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii, was taking pictures of an unknown light or object in the sky from the tower of his station. After taking several photographs, he developed them and noted unusual objects in the pictures. These photographs were taken between 1825 and 1840 hours (6:25 and 6:40 pm) local time at Honolulu, Hawaii. 

The objects in the photographs are approximately as follows:
(1) Three objects in a triangular formation, each appearing to be about the size of a DC-4 aircraft when viewed at the same distance.
(2) One object appearing to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter.
(3) Several smaller objects, round in shape and varying in size from approximately 10 to 20 feet in diameter.
(4) All objects maintained a steady, hovering flight.

The weather at the time was clear and visibility was good. The photographs submitted indicate a very definite, unusual occurrence worthy of investigation. The investigation is continuing, and the photographs and additional information will be forwarded as soon as possible.

Castro Valley, California

Mary Noltie, Castro Valley, California, called the sheriff's office and reported she had seen a circular object come down to about 40 feet above the ground and then rapidly ascend out of sight. This incident occurred at about 4:30 PM on 3/19/56. Callers said the object was about 30 feet in diameter, silver in color, and made no noise. The object appeared to be tilted as it descended and ascended.
An investigation was made but no other witnesses were located. The object could not be identified as any known aircraft or phenomenon. The case remains unidentified.
