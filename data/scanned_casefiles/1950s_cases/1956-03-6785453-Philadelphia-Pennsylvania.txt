10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bright white object with tinge of orange observed during twilight hours. Appeared as solid similar to Sirius. Sharply outlined. In flight to SW. Decreased in size and brightness as distance increased. Initial observation at 45 dgr elevation 80 dgr azimuth. Disappeared behind clouds at 80 dgr elevation 10 dgr azimuth, indicating rapid climb. Passed almost overhead.

11. COMMENTS
Possible illusion as to increase in altitude due to object passing near zenith. Duration rather short for a balloon observation. Some feature of a/c should have been noted as object neared overhead position. Possible balloon or a/c sighting. Insufficient data for analysis.

SIGHTING: (See notes below) - On the evening of 16 Mar 56, an unidentified bright white light, suspended at about a 50-degree angle, was observed over the city of Cincinnati, Ohio. A bright white light, somewhat blush-white light, suspended at about a 50-degree angle over the horizon, however, was slow-paced blankly, appeared to be a compact most impressively many to the northwest, creating similar and strange well it disappeared. Details of a SAFB man in the above, section of town reported. He was suggested by one leading cancer researcher that it was only the first Venus. We have no firm ground information on the matter, so we are waiting the times for what they are worth.

CINCINNATI 19-24 MARCH
OBSERVATIONS OF VENUS

It's Only Star, Folks!
"Thing" Is Identified
From Plane Window
BY ED SMITZ

It came out again in the western sky last night—Greater Cincinnati's eerie, mysterious light.

It was a star.

As reports of the strangely glowing object began coming into The Enquirer news room at 8 p.m., a reporter and a pilot, another at Ohio National Guard C-45 plane and an F-84 Thunderjet swooped down to make contact with the light in mid-air.

Capt. John R. Kies, pilot, Gen. Edwin McNack, OANG adjutant general, and his executive officer, Capt. Edwin Priwer.

The two-engine C-45 followed the murky ribbon that was the Ohio River and reached 1500 feet in its climb to 10,000.

Alan Kain, who had photographed the object from the ground the night before, peered through the pilots' windshield.

"There it is!" he shouted.

"Pretty star, isn't it?" the pilot said.

A brief conference with the photographer brought from him the statement that the "thing" of the night before was the same body the pilots had called a star.

It twinkled, bright and friendlike, just as it had for thousands of years.

Back at the airport lobby, General Clark said the "thing" was "just a beautiful, normal star."

"I think I've seen that same star for years," he said. "I'm not familiar enough with the stars' names to know for sure whether it's Venus or another planet."

We chased it then and identified it as a planet.

General Clark and Captain Priwer explained that the dirty, distracted atmosphere of cities often refracted the light from bright stars in such a way that the body appeared as a moving off-colored streamers.

But many earth-proud Greater Cincinnatians were convinced last night—for the fourth consecutive night—that they were seeing something extraordinary, perhaps extra-terrestrial.

What they saw, with the naked eye, was an intense bluish-white light suspended at about a 30-degree angle above the horizon. Through six-power binoculars, it looked like a compact, pulsing light of colored lights, slowly revolving and moving northwestward.

The star was seen last night from North Bend, Cleves, Evendale and other points, as quicker was told.

Earlier yesterday, Capt. Charles A. Hardin, in charge of the agency which investigated all reports of unidentified objects for the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, said a systematic check of "everything" had been in the skies over Greater Cincinnati in the last four days.

He said the ATIC was "deeply interested" in the object and would study photographs and testimony and evidence about it.

Bill Bradshaw, a member of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society, says it is the planet Venus, exceptionally brilliant object in the evening sky. It sets nearly four hours after the sun.

Handwritten notes on the side and bottom of the document include various comments about Venus and the star/planet observation.

During the spring of 1956 Venus stimulated an unusual amount of flying-saucer excitement. About 9:00 E.S.T. on the nights of March 20, 21, and 22, dozens of persons in Cincinnati, Ohio, telephoned the newspapers and the local headquarters of Civilian Research Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO), to report an unidentified flying object that was burning "like a beacon" in the western sky. A reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer stated: "To the naked eye, the object appeared to be an extraordinarily intense bluish white light . . . through binoculars, the object appeared to be a compact galaxy of lights, changing form as they revolved slowly. At one point, with binoculars set slightly out of focus, it assumed the appearance of a diamond brooch ringed with emeralds turning lazily on an eccentric axis." The object was visible for nearly an hour, moved slowly to the northwest, and disappeared.

Astronomers quickly identified the unknown as Venus. To the saucer enthusiasts, however, it appeared as a low-flying luminous object with swept-back wings, hovering in the west, making no sound, and displaying colors that changed from red to white. While admitting that some of the reported sightings might have been Venus, the editor of Orbit (the official publication of CRIFO) argued that an object that changed shape and sparkled like diamonds and emeralds could not possibly be Venus. He stated "that the public should know that out of seventeen UFO reports received for a three day period, ten were explainable as Venus but six were not!"

Although this arithmetic perhaps requires further explanation, the flying saucer reports did not offer a real puzzle. The time, the position, the colors, and the apparent motions of the object were entirely consistent with those expected for the planet under the prevailing atmospheric conditions. Dr. Paul Herget of the Cincinnati Observatory had easily identified the "mysterious" object. He added that Venus would continue to get brighter and brighter until the middle of May, and that the number of UFOs sighted would probably increase correspondingly.

He was right. Less than three weeks after the excitement in Cincinnati, Venus inspired one of the most notorious "Unknowns" in the history of saucedom, one that evoked charges of fraud, false-hood, and conspiracy on a grand scale.

SEES SAUCER FROM ONLY TEN FEET AWAY: A laboratory technician named James Bissett, a resident of Lansing, Michigan, reported last March 22nd that he saw a saucer during the early morning hours while walking along the banks of the Grand River. Said he: "I couldn't sleep, so I got up to take a walk. Near the west city limits, my attention was drawn to a tiny object in the sky, about the size of a period. As I watched, it grew larger and larger and came down upon me at an angle. It was an orange, globular-shaped object, finally only about 5 feet in diameter, and hovered about four feet from the ground. As near as I can determine, it was about 3 a.m., but I lost sight of the object at times. Bugs and that object was apparently metallic, and that it remained for about 10 minutes and then went away."

'SAUCERS'

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER HONOLULU (Story Page Seven.)

FROM STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER - On Monday, March 5, 1956, William L. Warnall
and his wife, both of Honolulu, Hawaii, were going north on 10th
Avenue when they "spotted something" in the sky at about 6:15 p.m.
about the size of a dime at arm's length. The sky was clear, visibility
was good, and the wind was light. They stopped their car at the
close, and visibility unlimited, prevailing trade winds, about 10
miles an hour. They took out their camera and took a picture (first
a picture) of the objects with its Cannon 35m camera.

The photograph was taken facing west, with the Koko Head crater in
the background. The objects were at about 200 feet altitude, and
about 200 feet distance from the car. Mr. Warnall stated that the
objects had no apparent motion. The photograph was developed and
disaster filed in Honolulu. Warnall was not sure of their
identification. Apparently located in the central color, the
time of the sighting was a blue-gray, the light parts of the
objects a light gray. The photograph was taken with a
right-angle finder attachment to the camera. An 8x10 print was
made. Included the orientation of a fairly large "saucer" 135-degree
arc. Warnall stated that the objects were traveling about 20 miles
per hour. Traveled about 20 miles in its own length and maintained
a steady course. Warnall stated in a later telephone conversation
that the aircraft or object appeared to a central body.


- page 14 -

1958 was a very interesting year for UFO activity, as the eyes of cameras recorded the "saucer" on film over 15 times.

On March 5 Sgt. William L. Wannall photographed with 35 mm color film 4 reddish-orange objects in formation, leaving trails over Honolulu, Hawaii.

Fir. 15--Castro Valley (near Hayward), Calif.--Three residents,
Mary and Wm. Jones and Mrs. A. Moore, all reported seeing a bright, glowing object passing through the sky and waiting
overhead. Informants stated that the object was traveling on a road. Mrs. Salas said "it appeared the object was about to strike
