Dear Sir or Madam

I have acquired an object, discovered locally, that at first I believed to be a meteor. However, after closer examination I have decided it to be the nose cone of a rocket, about the size of a "Jupiter C" nose cone, but heavier and differently shaped. (I am familiar with the external structure of the Jupiter C.)

I am enclosing two rough sketches, portraying the object, which is aluminum, about the size of a 3" shell, with the surface flawed and sticking from heat, except the nose, which is sound.

Its overall length is shown on the drawing at right 6 pounds 4 ounces.

If interested, please send someone to secure the object.

Sincerely,

P.S. (See reverse side)


- page 2 -

U.S. Science while collecting unusual probe acquired this sight while rock hunting. I am not a crank or crack pot. I have not my find. I am not seeking personal public.

I am only curious as to the identity of the sight. My reasons for believing it to be a rocket more cone stem from my experience in aircraft and my education. (I am an undergraduate aeronautical engineer studying at Tulsa University.) I know of our system is probably plagued by people who have found or have seen unusual sights. I am not one, although I may be completely in error as to the identity of the object.

ATTN: HOWARD CROSS

Reference our conversation of last week regarding what is thought to be a nose cone from the Jupiter Missile. We wish to send this object to FWS via staff car on 3 April 1958. Request that you accomplish the following examinations:

1. X-Ray to determine internal content.

2. Determination of the wire gauge to see if this conforms with standard U. S. gauge for copper wire.

If thought feasible by your office, a spectrographic analysis of the wire to ascertain whether it matches U. S. specifications.

It is requested that these examinations be expedited; that the object be returned by staff car the same date, and that the results of the examinations by X-Ray and wire analysis be forwarded to the Center by 10 April 1958. Please advise by TWX this date if this can be done.

UNCLASSIFIED

The investigation was requested by the Commander, 3595th Air Base Wing, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, by letter dated 12 March 1958, based upon a UFO sighting report from [redacted] ALTO, Wright-Patterson AFB, who stated that [redacted] in his possession allegedly resembles the nose cone of the Jupiter missile.

The writer was assisted in this investigation by Special Agent JOHN E. [redacted]

TULSA, OKLAHOMA

On 19 March 1958, Mr. [redacted] by Special Agent [redacted] STATES that the object was found in a field approximately ten (10) miles northeast of Tulsa on 13 January 1958. The object was found by a co-worker of [redacted] by 6 feet first class geologist and a collector of unusual rocks and stones as a hobby, picked up the object to thinking it was a piece of a meteor. [redacted] the object in his possession for a week to 10 days at which time he started to clean it up.

At this time he examined the object and found it was composed of a metallic substance with a rubber core and a piece of insulated wire protruding from the base. At this time he was employed at Douglas Aircraft in Tulsa, and a Field Service Inspector and had seen the missile being produced at the Douglas plant. Since the object somewhat comes close to what he had seen, he had contacted by mail the Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB on 13 March 1958, and had on or about 10 March 1958 made them aware of his discovery. The fact that the object was a meteorite had not been mentioned to anyone in the event the object was of some significance.

During the week, however, he can be reached at Bill Goza's, 1st Missile Company, 30, for the next few weeks, he will be available at his Tulsa address.

Examination of the object in [redacted] possession disclosed a projected metallic object of approximately thirteen (13) inches in length, four (4) inches in width, and weighing approximately six (6) pounds. Further examination disclosed the object has a core of an unknown black substance with an outer shell of a different material from the base of the object.

The object was previously received for and is being retained in District Intelligence files for further investigation.

TO:   District Commander, 5th District Office of Special Investigations,
       Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1.   Reference is made to your correspondence of 31 March 1958, and
basic correspondence above regarding the findings of this Center with regard
to an object purporting to be a nose cone of a guided missile. (UNCLASSIFIED)

2.   A detailed study and analysis reveals that the object is used for
the prevention of corrosion in pipelines, and probably used in oil operations.
A copy of the report is attached for your information and case files. (UNCL)

3.   In paraphrased telephone conversations between Lt. Col. C. Neum,
11th District Commander, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma and Capt. Gregory, this Center,
6 April 1958 regarding certain aspects and circumstances of this case,
Col. Neum requested that he be advised if there appears to be any elements of
fraud, falshoods or anything of questionable nature in this case. (CONF)

4.   This Center cannot comment with any degree of certainty as to the
possibility of an attempted hoax, on the basis of available information.
However, it appears odd that a person who is a technical inspector with the
aircraft industry and an amateur geologist as well, could not recognize items
which are commonly associated with local operations, particularly an item
believed to be used in oil operations. A question may also arise as to the
reason why no attempt was made by Source to personally check locally to deter-
mine the identity or use of the object before contacting the Air Force
with the very strong opinion that the object was a rocket nose cone. (CONF)

5.   As Source has expressed a desire to be informed of the identity of
the object, it is presumed that either your office or the 11th District Office
will contact Source. In this regard, it is requested that Source be queried
as to the disposition of the object, should it be returned or retained by the
Air Force? (UNCLASSIFIED)

6.   The cooperation and assistance rendered this Center in these investiga-
tions is appreciated. (UNCLASSIFIED)

An x-ray negative was made of the object first. This shows a small metal tube or pipe, probably hollow, down the center of this object. There is a metallic plug within the end of the tube opposite the painted end of the object. Attached to this metal plug are two wires but only one protrudes from the pitch used to fill the hole.

Inspection of the x-ray photographed by the "Corrosion Division" indicated that the sample was probably a sacrificial electrode used for prevention of corrosion of pipe lines buried in soil. The tube and electrical connections to the plug are the normal method of construction for such an electrode.

Such electrodes are customarily made from pure zinc, magnesium-base, or aluminum-base alloys. Spectrographic examination of the object indicates it to be of a magnesium-base alloy.

MEMORANDUM FOR UFO FILES

SUBJECT: Late Receipt of UFO Reports

1. This issue of air (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover letter by the 4602d AISS, who received them from the Reference (a) GOI msg file, later dated 26 December 1956, subject: "CGI UFOB Reports".

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1950) for the oldest, to over 7 months for the newest (August 1956). It appears that the CGI had 'pigeonholed' the reports for some unknown reason before submitting them to the 4602d AISS.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis difficult, if not impossible. A preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.

The image appears to be a heavily redacted document with multiple black rectangles obscuring text. At the bottom of the page, the word "UNCLASSIFIED" is visible. Due to the extensive redaction, most of the text is illegible. The document seems to be a black and white scanned page from an official report, with a vertical margin on the left side and varying degrees of image darkness and contrast.

Much of the text in this document is illegible due to poor image quality and redaction. Some words and phrases are partially visible, but a complete and accurate transcription is not possible. Several sections of the document have been blacked out with redaction marks. The bottom of the page contains some partially visible text and what appear to be administrative stamps or markings, but these are also difficult to read clearly.
