Dear Sir or Madam,

I have acquired an object described locally, that at first I believed to be a meteor. However, after closer examination I have decided it to be in the nature of a spaceship, about the size of a "Jupiter C" missile, and remotely and silently hovered. Similarities with the external structure of the "Jupiter C" are startling, but my views on its nature are tentative, and it is diminishing, and as it moved from heat, except the nose, which is warmed.

After all long as this is shown on the training site eight pounds of course.

If interested, please send someone to observe as I believe this to be of great significance.

My reasons for this investigation is to seek the truth and to learn from my experience in all fairness and my undergraduate education at Masters University is probably plagued by people who have had or have some unurual experience —I am not, all though I may be compietely in error as to the identity of the object.

The image contains a photograph of an irregularly-shaped object that appears to be some kind of rock or meteorite within a rectangular frame.

TEXT OUTPUT:

THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED ON JANUARY 6, 1958 BY MR. AND MRS. JOHN L. TEEPLE DRIVING SOUTH ON U.S. HIGHWAY 66 APPRCXI¬ MATELY 3 MILES NORTH OF TULSA, OKLAHOMA. THEY STOPPED THEIR CAR AND EXAMINED THE OBJECT WHICH LOOKED LIKE A ROCK. IT WAS FOUND BY MR. TEEPLE TO BE ABOUT 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHED APPROXIMATELY 2 LBS.
THE OBJECT WAS OF AN IRREGULAR SHAPE AND APPEARED SCORCHED OR CHARRED ON THE SURFACE. THERE WERE NO VISIBLE MARKINGS OR DISTINGUISHING FEATURES ON THE OBJECT.
MR. TEEPLE BROUGHT THE OBJECT TO THE TULSA POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO IN TURN DELIVERED IT TO LT. COL. J.L. JORDAN OF THE 4676TH AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENT (ATIC) FOR EXAMINATION.
THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOST LIKELY A METEORITE OR SOME OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA RATHER THAN A MAN-MADE OBJECT.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a typed letter from the Project Blue Book investigation. The letter discusses an object believed to be a nose cone from the Jupiter Missile, and requests that X-ray analysis and wire gauge measurements be performed on the object to determine its internal content and gauge.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

DATE: 7 APR 58

MIX TO PROJECT WHITE STORKS
ATTN: HOWARD CROSS

Reference our conversation of last week regarding what is thought to be a nose cone from the Jupiter Missile. We wish to send this object to HQ via staff car on 8 April 1958. Request that you accomplish the following examinations:

1. X-Ray to determine internal content.
2. Determination of the wire gauge to see if this conforms with standard U. S. gauge for copper wire.

If thought feasible by your office, a spectrographic analysis of the wire to ascertain whether it matches U. S. specifications.

It is requested that these examinations be expedited; that the object be returned by staff car the same date, and that the results of the examinations by X-Ray and wire analysis be forwarded to the Center by 10 April 1958. Please advise by TWX this date if this can be done.

4. This Center cannot comment with any degree of certainty as to the possibility of an attempted hoax, on the basis of available information. Information appears to indicate a technical inspector with the Air Force industry and an expert geologist as well, could not recognize items assembled as the object in recent operations in this case. It appears no attempt was made by source to personally check locally to determine the identity or use of the object, since there was a very strong opinion that the object was a rocket nose cone. (CONF)
5. As source has expressed a desire to be informed of the identity of the object, it is presumed that you will advise the 5th District Office as to the disposition of the object, should it be returned or retained by the Air Force. (UNCL/RESTRICTED)

CASE 6957919 TULSA, OKLAHOMA 
SUBMITTED BY: H. C. D., Rte. 1, Tulsa, Oklahoma
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 10 February 1958
TIME OF OBSERVATION: Approximately 7:30 p.m. 
LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: Route 1, Tulsa, Oklahoma
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: The witness stated that he observed a large, bright object in the sky while he was driving home. The object was about the size of a basketball and had an irregular shape. It appeared to be hovering about 150 feet above the ground and was brightly illuminated. The witness stated that the object seemed to be pulsating and that it was larger than the full moon. 
DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECT: The witness stated that the object remained stationary for about 3 to 4 minutes, then suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly to the southwest, disappearing from view in about 10 seconds.
WEATHER CONDITIONS: Clear sky, no wind.
OTHER WITNESSES: None reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The witness provided a detailed description of the object he observed, which does not match any known aerial phenomena. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object suggest that it was some kind of unidentified flying object.

The image does not contain any photographs. It is a page from a document that discusses the analysis of a "x-ray photographed" sample by the "Corrosion Division". The text describes the characteristics of the sample, including that it was a "sacrificial electrode" and the normal construction for such electrodes. The text also mentions that the electrodes are typically made from pure zinc, magnesium-base, or aluminum-base alloys.

Tulsa, Oklahoma 
January 17-18, 1952

An x-ray negative was made of the suspect parts. This shows a small metal tube or capsule, probably a battery-operated device. The center of this object is bright. There is a material plate within the end of the tube opposite the brightened and corroded area. Attached to this material are two wires which come through the end of the tube.

Inspection of the x-ray photographed by the "Corrosion Division" indicated that the sample was probably a sacrificial electrode used for prevention of corrosion of pipe lines buried in soil. The tube and electrical connections to the plug are the normal method of construction for such an electrode.

Such electrodes are customarily made from pure zinc, magnesium-base, or aluminum-base alloys. Spectrographic examination of the object indicates it to be of a magnesium-base alloy.

Through:   AFCIN-4B3
1.  The sample transmitted this morning for examination as it used magnesium base is believed to be that submitted for examination concerning a pipe line.
2.  The attached X-ray negative was made of the sample first.  This shows a metal tube inside of the sample.  There is a metallic plug within the end of the tube opposite the rounded and of the sample.  Attached to this metallic plug are two wire but only one protrudes from the pitch used to fill the hole.
3. Spectrographic examination of the sample indicated that the sample was probably a corrosion product from an electrode used for spot welding or pipe lining.  The tube and electrical connections to the plug are the normal method of construction for such electrodes.
4. Such electrodes are customarily made from pure zinc, magnesium-base, or aluminum-base alloys.  Spectrographic examination of the sample body indicates it to be of a magnesium-base alloy.
5. No further examination appears necessary.  The sample is returned under separate cover.

1. This is a summary of six (6) UFO reports submitted under the cover letters of the RECORD LIAISON, who received them from the RADAR ANALYSIS BRANCH file. Later dated 26 December 1956, subject: "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena".

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest to over 7 months for the newest (August 1956). It appears that the G-2 had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reasons before submitting them to the AEDC/ATIC.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis difficult, if not impossible. A preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.
