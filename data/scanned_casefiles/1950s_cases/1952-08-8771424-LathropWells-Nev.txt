"At 10 P.M. 26 August 1952, I observed a strange object which gave my
vision of the headlights of my car. At this time my position was a few miles
northwest of Lathrop Wells, Nevada. This object first appeared as a small
oval light traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. The course of travel
was from the 12 o'clock to 8 o'clock position. As the object drew near
of me, at that time approximately 50 to 70 miles, the object, as it approached
me, grew larger in proportion but maintained its spherical appearance. The
illumination was from an 18 source. There was no apparent heat. The
object. By car with me a mile distant. I viewed due to its warm night. I also had
on a pair of around seven-inch prisms. These, that clearly showed the object
the glasses as it approached to have a definite size. It appeared definitely
to be circular or the elliptical, then made a definite when large. Its center
was very distinct. As it went, way from me the 14th slant range was completely
and a small object. Very central in appearance. This is because it was moving
a climb in altitude. The upper half of the contour was a bright silver to it
or gray-in-silver color. The lower half of the contour was a white or light
in an orange. It was a definite V-type control with a back center, two
major V-1 type jets, some to a point. The acceleration was some as in the
small object of time to travel to its really increased. Again at a closer
distance than when it was first observed there was a great sound. Later
the was noted a very definite formation of three objects in a line, somewhat
down at 10 i.e. The rate of travel of the object was extremely high.

I have the twelve (12) years of flying, pilot observer-navigator, combat
missions in my last Korea.

There was no fragmentary or photographic evidence of the object.

The incident was reported to the Mac Intelligence section, 13th Fighter
Wing, Nellis AFB, according to procedure, on 27 Aug 52, from 1330 to 1500
arrival at Elko, Nevada."
