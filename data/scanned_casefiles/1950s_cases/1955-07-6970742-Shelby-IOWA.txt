    Address: Shelby, Iowa
    Occupation: Cashier, Farmer's Savings Bank, Shelby, Iowa.
    Qualifications: GOC Post Supervisor

II. RELIABILITY:    Not possible to judge from information available.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source noticed flashing lights in sky "north
east 10 miles and high." Lights "changed from red to green to white to lights changed
on this object. Once in a while a light beam would come in front to a point." Also a
shadowy white beam coming to a point would show below the object." At 30/0815Z
another object was seen, characterized as a "pea" held at arms length. The object did
not appear to move. Observation through 7 power binoculars did not reveal any details.
At 30/0830 it looked like an oncoming car, one mile away. Weather was scattered
clouds, but good visibility, wind was estimated 30 knots from 110 degrees. Pictures of
the object (See Incl. 1) were taken with an 81mm Compar lens camera Reflex 1 Compco
single picture type, 620.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 2-4, 46028 AISS                                 REPORT NO. 2-AA-UFOB-2-55        PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. Upon assignment to Detachment 2 for investigation Capt Bischofs began to conduct the investigation, however, he was unable to develop any leads. The investigation was then turned over to Flight 2-A exclusively for initial report and photographs had gone to the D/I 31st Air Division.

2. Checking with research agencies in this area revealed that there were no balloons from Minneapolis over Iowa at the time. Also the lights carried on balloons are generally white or possibly red and white, flashing.

3. At 30/0730Z July 55 a B-25 type aircraft, #AF6170, passed within five (5) miles of the object and was asked by the ACAM site at Omaha if they could see the object. The pilot reported he could not see it.

4. When the film was developed by the 514th Materiel Sqdn Photo Lab nothing showed. (See Part One, Incl 1)

5. It is believed that Moby Dick balloons carry only a white light.

6. The U. of Minnesota Observatory said that there was nothing astronomical that would cause such a sighting on that night.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 2-A, 4602d AISS                                     REPORT NO. 2A-UFOB-2-55     PART THREE     PAGE 4 OF 4 PAGES

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was possibly caused by an airplane, for the following reasons:
   a. The color of the lights and their flashing would be those of an aircraft
   b. The lack of motion could be explained by wind or by a helicopter or a convertible.
   c. The description of the white lights sounds like landing or maybe search-lights.
   d. Investigation discovered no ballon or astronomical activity that would account for the sighting.

[Signed]
WALTER E. SAMPSON
2/Lt., USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
1. This headquarters does not agree with the possibility of an aircraft generated sighting as set forth by the Preparing Officer for the following reasons:
   a. The duration of the sighting was too long for that of an aircraft sighting.
   b. The object appeared to remain motionless for more than two and one-half hours.

2. This headquarters offers the hypothesis that this sighting was possibly caused by a balloon for the following reasons:
   a. The object remained high and motionless for a long period of time.
   b. Viewing of ordinary white light through low power optical instruments such as the binoculars used can induce colors which the object does not actually possess.
   c. Balloons of the rawinsonde type, released from Air Force Weather Stations and detachments thereof daily, can be seen after dark up to an altitude of Forty Thousand feet without visual aids.
   d. The revolving of the balloon or oscillation of the suspension train (carrying the modulator unit), caused by wind currents, could account for the flashing lights and the beams of light which at times came from the object.
