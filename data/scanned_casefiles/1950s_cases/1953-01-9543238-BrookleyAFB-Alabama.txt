[Most of the text is partially legible due to image quality, but here's what I can discern:]

[Several lines appear to be blacked out or obscured]

The document appears to be related to an intelligence report, with references to locations like Colorado and Ohio. Some text mentions a "FLYING OBJECT" and coordinates, but the full details are difficult to read clearly.

The document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top of the page.

There are some handwritten annotations on the side of the document, including "ATIC" and a number "3:00".

The image quality makes it challenging to read the full text with complete accuracy.

The top of the page appears to have some text, but it is too illegible for me to confidently transcribe.

There is a small object that looks like a small oval or teardrop shape on the left side of the document.

AF FORM 112-PART II
UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Intelligence Officer
Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama

Details: At approximately 0900 hours, 2 January 1953, Captain came to the Base Intelligence Office, Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama, and reported seeing, at 2015-2030 hours, 1 January 1953, a bluish white light similar to a jet aircraft exhaust. He stated that the light disappeared after about 30 seconds. He saw no other lights which would identify an aircraft. Since the weather was clear, he did not think the light disappeared behind a cloud.

Base Operations, and nearby Bates Field (Commercial) were contacted by telephone and could report no flying activity involving jet aircraft. At 2100 hours an F-51 landed at Brookley Air Force Base, and no other claims in the immediate vicinity have facilities for jet aircraft. The weather station at Bates Field reported releasing a weather balloon (piball) at 2100 hours, but this was after the reported observation.

When the light was sighted, the observer was facing West at latitude 30 degrees, thirty-eight minutes North, 88 degrees, seven minutes West, and stated that the light was traveling North approximately one mile away at an altitude of 2000-3000 feet, and a speed of 220-300 knots. The light appeared to be one to two feet in diameter, with a small exhaust trail.

The reliability of the observer is evaluated as excellent. Captain is a Senior Pilot, with ten years flying experience, and is familiar with meteorology, and navigation.

Since the report was not received until twelve hours after observation, interception was not attempted.

2 January 1953

STATEMENT OF: Captain Douglas C.

I certify that the following was observed by me while attending a drive-in movie, between 2015 and 2030 on the night of 1 January 1953.

I saw this light when it was approximately 60° to my left. It was traveling at a constant altitude of 2000-3000 feet on a bearing of north.

The object appeared to be 1 to 2 feet in diameter of bluish white in color with a small exhaust trail. The speed of the object was estimated at 250-200 knots. It traveled through approximately 80° of an arc in 30 seconds and appeared to start a climbing turn and disappeared, just as though someone had turned off a light switch.

The object was approximately 1 mile away and it looked like the exhaust of a F-94 with afterburner going. I did not hear any noise at all, the windows of the car were up and the loudspeaker was on. I could not see anything at all to identify it as an aircraft, as there were no lights on the object. Weather at the time was clear with unrestricted visibility.
