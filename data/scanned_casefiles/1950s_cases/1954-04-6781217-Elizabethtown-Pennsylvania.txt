Statement C.
Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania

1. I am the foreman in charge of Ore and Lumber Reclamation in the Material Facilities Division at Middletown Air Material Area, Middletown, Pennsylvania. I have worked at Olmsted Air Force Base as a civilian employee for approximately ten years.

2. On Thursday evening my wife and a friend of mine were sitting on the back porch when my wife exclaimed, "Look at the moon." This was approximately thirteen minutes to ten o'clock.

3. I looked into the sky in a westerly direction and saw a reddish object with an orange glow similar to a westerly direction. This object appeared to be to have come out of the northwest part of Pennsylvania.

4. I would judge that this object was approximately a mile and a half to two miles above the ground level. It seemed to be about as large as the moon at that time. It moved in the sky at that time. It looked like the size of a grapefruit.

5. This object definitely appeared to me to be moving faster than the speed of my conventional plane. It seemed to move on the same speed at all times. It did not seem to be in formation and I would say it remained in the same place at all times.

6. As well as I can remember I was this object in the sky for about five or six minutes. In clearly defined formation, it was stationary in my back yard. It did not move away from me that I could see. My wife and I. Lickman were watching with me at all times.

7. My wife and I. thought we could get a better glimpse of this object to the back yard where I went.

8. It seemed to be a matter of only a few seconds, after we went to the yard, that I heard a noise. I was looking in the sky parallel to the object which he saw on the second view. He sighted the object which he saw on the second evening appeared to move across the path it followed on the first sighting. He sighted it was much higher, seemed to move faster than the sky out of sight when he saw it for the second time.

9. We all left my yard and went to a nearby parking lot where there were no lights to interfere with our vision. Once again I scanned the sky for a glimpse of the object which I described above. There was no trace of it.

Statement of, [illegible text] Elizabethtown, Pa.

9. Just about this time while I was searching the sky I saw a light which I recognized as the spotlight used on conventional airplanes. After a few moments passed I observed the spotlight was shifted to a regular conventional type plane.

10. After a few minutes passed I returned to my home and called Olmsted Air Force Base. The telephone operator at Olmsted referred my call to Flight Operations.

11. I gave the individual who took my call in Flight Operations a preliminary report on what I had seen in the sky in Elizabethtown earlier that evening.

12. A friend of mine who lives at the Filler Center located at the town 11th, on the State Hospital property, in Elizabethtown. My purpose in going there was to inquire if my wife's ground observer had seen what I had seen. While there, another friend was also present and no one was in the sky.

13. I returned home and with wife told me that someone from the Middle township police had called and asked for me. At about eleven o'clock on this same evening, I first received a call from a lady who stated she was a member of the Civil Air Patrol. Earlier, I gave this individual all the information that I had concerning the flying object I had seen on the night of April 8, 1954.

14. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

29 April 1954 [signature appears to be blacked out]

This statement was obtained and written by the undersigned investigating officer and read and signed in the presence of the undersigned at Olmsted Air Force Base, Elizabethtown, Pa. Copies of same furnished to the interested agencies. This statement is in the Intelligence Office File, the Reporter General's Office, by MAIL.
