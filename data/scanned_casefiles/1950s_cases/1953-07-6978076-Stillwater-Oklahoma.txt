DETAILS:

1. This investigation was predicated upon information received telephonically from Special Agent AUBREY S. BROWN, Atlanta Field Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, to the effect that three men had seen an unknown flying object near Atlanta, Georgia, the night of 2nd July 1953.

AT ATLANTA, GEORGIA

2. The following portion of the investigation was conducted by Special Agent JAMES V. WARD.

3. At 0855 hours on 3 July 1953, Special Agent AUBREY S. BROWN, Atlanta Field Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, telephonically contacted the Atlanta Detachment, 6th District OSI (10), and advised Special Agent JAMES V. WARD of a telephone call received by the FBI night agent at 0345 hours, 8 July 1953. In this call, Mr. THOMAS HORAS of the Atlanta Constitution informed the FBI of the following information given him by ---------, N. E., Atlanta, --------- and told HORAS that he (-------) and two (2) companions were driving on Bankhead Highway (U. S. Highway 78) near Fullerton, Georgia, when they saw three (3) animals go to an object, which he described as a flying object, and took off in the object, which immediately disappeared. Further stated that he can tell the third animal, killing is, HORAS told the FBI that he brought the dead animal to the Atlanta Constitution (10 Forsyth Building, Atlanta, Georgia), where HORAS examined it. HORAS described the animal as resembling a member of the monkey family, approximately twenty-one (21) inches in length, with long ears, and pink coloring, but having neither tail nor hair. HORAS advised that he had a local veterinarian (unidentified) examine the animal and stated that he had never seen such an animal before. In his call to OSI, Special Agent BROWN (FBI) noted HORAS's emphatic statement that none of the Atlanta Constitution staff were drunk in making the claims. No further information was given to the FBI, according to BROWN.

4. At 1000 hours on 8 July 1953, Special Agent JAMES V. WARD briefly interviewed --------- at --------- N. E., concerning his allegation of seeing the flying object, and advised that he and his two companions had just driven over a hill on the Bankhead Highway where they saw a bright red glow moving in front of the car. --------- stated that they saw three (5) animals jump for the moving red object and that two got on the object, apparently with it. --------- could not identify his third companion, however, killing the animal. --------- identified his companions as --------- who works at the Big Apple Store, Brookhaven, Georgia, and a person --------- who further questioned were unable to interview because of intrusion of reporters from the Atlanta Journal who sought to interview concerning the incident.

DETAILS (contd)

5. At approximately 1100 hours, 3 July 1953, the following authorities at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia, were telephonically advised of the incident: Captain J. P. DOUGHERTY, Base Operations Officer, Dobbins Air Force Base, and A/C JOHN SUMMERS, Intelligence Section, 35th Air Division, Dobbins Air Force Base, (A/C SUMMERS took the information for Captain HARRY S. SADDLES, Director of Intelligence, 35th Air Division, who was temporarily out of the office).

6. At 1615 hours, 3 July 1953, Captain SADDLES was telephonically contacted at the Intelligence Section, 35th Air Division, who advised that he had interviewed [redacted] and had seen the animal in question. Captain SADDLES advised that the animal had been taken to the Army University Hospital, where an x-ray (name of position) had been taken and identified as a member of the monkey family and not as "animal from space." Captain SADDLES further advised that he was at Headquarters USAF and to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, advising that he (SADDLES) believed the entire incident was a hoax. SADDLES further advised that pictures of the animal were taken, and that a complete "Flying Object Report" would be submitted within two days. Captain SADDLES advised that an information copy of the aforementioned EKG would be furnished to the Directorate of Special Investigations, as well as an information copy of the completed report.

7. The Atlanta Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia, dated 9 July 1953, page twelve (12), contained an article which identified the dead animal as a monkey which had been skinned and from which the tail had been removed. This conclusion was reached by Dr. HAROLD JONES of the State Crime Laboratory and Dr. WILSON HILLS, professor of experimental anatomy at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.

8. The Atlanta Journal, Atlanta, Georgia dated 9 July 1953, pages one (1) and four (4), contained an article which stated that [redacted] had confessed to Dobb County Police Chief JOHN LEE that the story was a hoax, explained that he was developed as a result of a $100.00 bet with a friend that he [redacted] could not get his picture in the paper. [redacted] was fined $40.00 for obstructing the highway and released at that time.

9 July 1953

The following information was obtained by long distance telephone from 1st Lieut. 477th Communication Squadron (C), 1st AF Force Base, Colorado Springs, Colorado. 1st Lieut. was at Cordell Hall, Oklahoma A & M Campus, Stillwater, Oklahoma, where he will remain until 25 July 1953.

1. As close as I could say it was elliptical, a dim white light compared with a ceiling light or the light a search light would throw on the bottom of a cloud. It was moving. It is possible that it could have been a search light; however, it moved back and forth in a limited arc. As far as I could tell, there was no overcast, as far as I know, the only thing that would throw up a light like this in the area of Tulsa, Oklahoma, approximately 70 miles away. The most objects I saw were two (2), one of which was intermittent. One was directly above the colors, there is a possibility of a trail. The movement light seemed to disappear occasionally. There was a very limited range of movement, I would say a 10° arc. I heard no noise. If these objects were at a distance, I think they were, the movement would have been quite rapid, I would say somewhere between 5 and 750 mph. This is based on that I have observed from aircraft. I have one object, no noise was there. From time to time I saw stars above the objects. I have never seen anything like this before.

2. I saw this object at approximately 2500 (EST) on 6 July 1953.

3. I observed it from the ground with the naked eye.

4. I was outside on the ground at Cordell Hall, Oklahoma A & M Campus, Stillwater, Oklahoma. The object was about 15° or 20° from the horizon. It was about 120° North. The A & M Campus is located in the North Central part of Stillwater, Oklahoma.

5. I have two (2) years experience as Control Tower Operator with the Air Force. I am a private pilot and have a CAA Certificate as a control tower operator. I have approximately one hundred (100) hours in the air.

6. Further argued towards North from 120° from East on up to about Northeast (about 45° to 90°) there was some lightning. It was off down to the horizon.

7. Meteorological condition is unknown.

8. I did not take any pictures and did not obtain any fragments.

9. There was no interference to my knowledge.

10. There was no aircraft in the air to the best of my knowledge.

9 July 1953

The following information was obtained by long distance telephone from Colonel J. Clancy, USAF, temporarily residing at Cordell Hall, Oklahoma A & M Campus, Stillwater, Oklahoma.

1. That I saw looked like two (2) search light flashes that varied much and forth, one lifting right on top of the other. They would flash back and forth and then come over one (1) location. I could then see a beam that would ground. You could see part of the beam that would come up. It would completely cut it. It was large. It is a search light beam. I saw this from (a) or (b) location. I thought it was a human light. There was no traffic this time of the country that I know of; however, I haven't spent much time here over the last five or six years. There was no sound. The color was a search light beam. I looked like a search light beam reflecting off a cloud. I couldn't tell how many objects there were. I saw: they were in the same locality. They looked like a search light cross. The method was very clear. I would draw one on top of the other. I couldn't see any trail or exhaust. There was no propulsion unit. I saw: (a) very small. They would start on one side of the horizon and move to the other. They would start just like a beam would start moving across the sky until they reached the place and stop on top of one another. I didn't see them disappear.

2. I was this at approximately 2300 (CST) on 6 July 1953.

3. I observed these with the naked eye.

4. I was watching through the second (2d) story of the dormitory. There was a screen in the window and the window was open. The object was in direction of southeast of the dormitory, about to a flight angle of 20°.

5. I have had no experience observing aircraft. I was in the ground forces of the service for thirty-three (33) months.

6. On this particular night it was cloudy, the overcast was more or less in the background of the object I was watching. The cloudiness was southeast of 110°.

7. I don't know anything about meteorology.

8. I did not take any pictures.

9. I don't remember hearing or seeing any aircraft in the air on that particular night.
