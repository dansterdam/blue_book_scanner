AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States
AREA REPORTED ON: Deer Springs, Nevada
DATE OF REPORT: 25 July 1953
PREPARED BY: G.E. Allen, Jr. Op 3rd CG
REFERENCES: (Other serial numbers, directives, or prior reports)

SUMMARY:

On 27 July 1953, I interviewed Mr. [redacted] of the G-2 Section, Nellis AF Base, Nevada, concerning an unidentified flying object. These men were together when they observed this object and their versions of the appearance of the object are relatively the same.

These men were having a picnic at Deer Creek Springs, Nevada, on Sunday, 25 July 1953, around the 1900 hours. [redacted] was the first to observe the object and after looking at it for a few minutes, noticed that it was stationary. Together they observed it for about a few minutes. After discussing with the aid of two points of knowledge, and 7 power and one 20 power, they give a description of the object is substantially as follows:

The object appeared to be at a tremendous height. The men estimated 70,000 feet or more. They could only see a minimum for this estimate, they also noticed its size was quite large. In the distance, at times, with a clear view for their observation, the object was to the northeast of their observation point. At high altitude, they commenced making their basic net in looking almost directly up. The object was stationary and had a white or silvery appearance. It was moving very slowly and had a visible line or shape of a saucer line. It was stationary for approximately 15 minutes and then moved to the area of the sun without a trace.

The two men finally got tired of watching the object and were waiting for a cloud or something to obscure the object but discovered the object had disappeared.

This officer can give no legal affidavit as to whether balloons or aircraft from this area were involved.

PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

At close around the ninth of July 1953, we were having a picnic at a camp club on the Blue Lake. We were having lunch when we noticed a light object in the sky. It was moving very slowly and appeared to be fairly powerful. We watched it for some time and it seemed to be motionless at first, then a slight movement was noted. It was high up and moving very slowly. When I first saw it, it was a desire surface on the top, such as a shallow curve. It was about as wide as a type, and we could see it quite clearly as we were sitting on an easy rise of the object. The object stayed in one spot for about an hour, the last time I looked I didn't see it.

I had two pairs of binoculars with me and observed the object there with same, one was 7x50 and the other 7 power. After looking for a while, I was so curious to see what it was. The object seemed to be around 75,000 feet high and located west of Deer Creek Springs.

Yesterday, 29 July 1953, at approximately 1100 A.M., at Deer Creek Springs, Nevada, I saw a flying object which I could not identify.

I could see it with my naked eye on a small shiny object and I moved it into more detail with a pair of 20 power binoculars. The object appeared to be round and remained stationary. While observing it for thirty minutes, I would judge it to be about 70 to 75 thousand feet in a north westerly direction from where I stood. I stopped looking up again 15 was gone.

26 July 1953                                                   Nellis AF Base, Nevada

Description

Two civilians who work in the Aero Maintenance Section at Nellis AF Base were on a picnic at Deer Creek Springs, Nevada, when they saw an unidentified flying object that was estimated to be 100 feet in diameter and at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The object was at every retails in color and reflected the rays of the sun brilliantly at times. The object was observed for a period of one hour with both ten power and seven power binoculars.

Discussion

Reporting officer stated in his report that there were no weather balloons or aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. A check was made with the upper air research balloon tracks received from Lowry AF Base revealing that there was very probably a balloon over the area at the time of this sighting.

Conclusion

Probably balloon (upper air research).
