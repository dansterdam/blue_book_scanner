Text extracted from the document:

The object seemed to move at a great speed, far exceeding any jet plane at that time. It was travelling a great distance in a very short time. It seemed to fly without sound and a certain strange quietness seemed to accompany it. While the objects were with the plane, the engine suddenly cut out which frightened the passengers. The pilots were able to get the engines started again and the plane landed safely. The pilots and another plane which they were in communication with tried to keep up with the UFO but were unable to.

San Diego, California, was the destination of the flight and they were over the San Diego, California, area when the incident took place. Pilots stated that they had a picture of the object but that this was apparently taken from the other plane as they had no camera on board. It is felt that this may be the only picture of the object in existence.

The letter discusses the Air Force's interest in unidentified flying objects and thanks the recipient for sharing information and photographs with the Air Technical Intelligence Center. The letter also states that the information will be carefully analyzed and compared with other reports of unidentified flying objects received.

San Diego 2, California
Dear Sir:
It was nice to hear from you again. Naturally the Air Force is particularly interested in the identities of flying objects that appear in the air space over the United States or its possessions. Naturally the Air Force is particularly interested in the identities of flying objects that appear in the air space over the United States or its possessions. Naturally the Air Force is particularly interested in the identities of flying objects that may be observed. If the photograph is as small that we may experience some difficulty in obtaining further information on the object, however, I wish to assure you that your photograph has been forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center. It will be studied carefully and compared with other reports of unidentified flying objects received by the Agency.
Again, let me repeat how pleasant it was to hear from you. Your continued support in matters of interest to the Air Force is deeply appreciated.
Sincerely,

TO: AFCIN-4E2t

1. A positive identification of the objects which appear in the attached photographs is not possible with the limited data available.

2. It is suggested that the negatives of these photographs be obtained, and also that more detailed information concerning the conditions under which the pictures were taken should be made available. As it is, the three images which were taken from an automobile? appear to be out of focus, and do not show the objects clearly.

3. The two photographs taken 26 Sep 60 show three images which cannot be explained from photo analysis. It is stated the objects did not appear until the photographs were developed.

4. The objects are out of focus which could mean either that they are very small and far away, or that the camera was not properly focused when they were photographed. It is suggested that the objects may have been retouched since the intensity of the dark objects is much greater than the other dark objects on these prints.

Transcription of the text:

"San Diego 2, California

Dec 3 1959

General Grant received your letter of 28 October upon his return from an extended trip to the Far East. Immediately thereafter he instructed me to reply in detail to your previous note forwarding General Grant's request that I reply to your present note and advise you when he might be in such a position that it would be impossible for him to state when he might visit your Intelligence Center. While General Grant is vitally interested in visiting your Intelligence Center, he feels that it would be more appropriate for your organization to ponder the matter further rather than requesting the Commander of the Center who has already received your original photograph as a General Grant indicated in his letter of 19 October to you.

Again, on behalf of General Grant, let me express our appreciation for your continued interest in Air Force matters.

Sincerely,
