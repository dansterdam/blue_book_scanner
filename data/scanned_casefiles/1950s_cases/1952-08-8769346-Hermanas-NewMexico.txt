The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a form used for Project Blue Book, which was the official United States Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969. The form provides details about a reported UFO sighting, including the date, location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation (air visual), and whether any physical evidence or photographs were obtained.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically an "Official ATIC Report" from El Paso, Texas.

The text in the report describes an incident where an Air Force colonel flying a jet observed 2 objects in the vicinity of Hermanas, New Mexico on August 24, 1952. The objects appeared to be round in shape, silver in color, and approximately 6 feet in diameter. The colonel observed the objects to be approximately 2 miles from him between the hours of 1000-1100 MST. There was no visible means of propulsion, and the objects seemed to change shape while in a right turn. The second object also seemed to change shape when it accelerated very rapidly. The objects disappeared 3 minutes after first being observed, but then reappeared after approximately 7 minutes, at which point one object seemed to climb straight up to 2,000-3,000 feet and was joined by the other in close formation. The ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) checked all possibilities of known objects in the air in the vicinity of the two sightings with negative results, and the conclusion was "Unknown".

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
HEADQUARTERS, 20TH AIR DIVISION, TURNER AFB, GA.
DATE OF REPORT: 24 August 1952
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object 
PLACE: Hermanas, New Mexico
REPORTING OFFICER: Warrant Officer Gerald V. Johnson

The report describes the sighting of an unidentified flying object by the reporting officer on August 24, 1952 at approximately 10:00 and 11:00 o'clock. The object was observed for 10-15 minutes and appeared to be approximately 25-30 feet in diameter, hovering and making sudden changes in direction. The report states that there were no visible means of propulsion and the object made no sound. It also mentions that the object took on a reddish-orange glow at times.

The report concludes by stating that the observed characteristics of the unidentified object were such that they would tend to be unexplainable, however, further investigation is required before any final conclusions can be drawn.

The report is approved by John E. Albert, Air Intelligence Officer.

There is no photograph present in this image. The text appears to be a typed report describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred on August 24, 1952 near Hermanas, New Mexico.

24 August 1952
An Air Force pilot, flying a jet at a/c, observed a circular object in the vicinity of Hermanas, New Mexico (31 deg 50 min N/108 deg 2 min W). The objects appeared to be round in shape, silver in color and approximately 6" in diameter. He observed them to be approximately 2 miles from him between the hours 1000-1100MST on 24 Aug 52. The first sighting was 1015-1018 MST and the second sighting 1025-1033 MST. There was no visible means of propulsion. One object seemed to change its shape to a long gray object (could be the same object) also seemed to change shape when it accelerated very rapidly. This object also seemed to take the shape of a long gray object twice as long as when it appeared as a ball. The objects disappeared 3 minutes from when first observed. After approximately 7 minutes the objects reappeared at which time the observer was over El Paso, Texas. One object seemed to climb straight up 2 or 3 thousand feet and was joined shortly thereafter by the other one in close formation.
The observed characteristics of these unidentified objects were such that would lead to no conclusion, however, their speed was so much greater than the 550 MPH indicated air speed of the observer and the fact that they could so quickly disappear on two occasions led the reporting officer to believe that their flight capabilities were greater than that of any aircraft known to this country.
The ATIC checked all possibilities of known objects in the air in the vicinities of the two sightings with negative results.
Conclusion: Unknown

- page 14 -

This page of the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. The text of the document is as follows:

Two unidentified objects were first observed visually and with binoculars at 1615 PDT for a period of 1 hour and 15 minutes. They were described as silver in color, spherical in shape. They were described to be at an estimated speed of 400 to 450 mph. No sound was heard. The objects were moving from 2 to 9. One object appeared to be at an approximately 18,000' and the other at about 13,000'. The two objects appeared to be at a relatively 15 miles passing over head of the observers. During this time the objects at about 13,000' apparently rose to the approximate speed of 9 altitude as the lower objects. Then the objects reached a single altitude W of the observers, falling to a slightly different position, apparently disappearing into the sun momentarily. After appearing to disappear into the sun momentarily, the observers then sighted the same 2 objects at the approximate location from which they were lost from view. During the latter period of observation, 6 additional objects of similar description were observed 15 to 20 miles W of the observers. This made the total size to 8 similar objects observed in this area. These additional 6 objects came into view in a trailing position and continued with the original 2 objects apparently to be in a vertical direction. The observers stated that the objects took up a different formation repeatedly covering an estimated 4 mile area. The observers also stated that the objects were definitely not jet and had no visible trail, exhaust or sound and further stated that it was difficult to follow any one object for any length of time.

The weather officer at Holloman Air Force Base reported the weather as clear, ceilings high broken. This report indicates the possibility that the objects sighted might have been weather balloons.
