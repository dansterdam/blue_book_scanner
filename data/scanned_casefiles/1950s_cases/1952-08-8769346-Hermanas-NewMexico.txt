OFFICIAL ATIC REPORT—EL PASO, TEXAS

An Air Force colonel flying a jet observed 2 objects in the vicinity of Hermanas, N. M. (31 deg 50 min N 108 deg 2 min W), Aug. 24, 1952. The objects appeared to be round in shape, silver in color and approximately 6" in diameter. He observed them to be approximately 2 miles from him between the hours 1000-1100 MST. There was no visible means of propulsion. One object seemed to change its shape to a long gray object while in a right turn. The second object also seemed to change shape when it accelerated very rapidly. The objects disappeared 3 minutes from when first observed. After approximately 7 minutes, the objects reappeared, at which time observer was over El Paso, Texas. One object seemed to climb straight up 2,000-3,000 feet and was joined by the other in close formation.

The ATIC checked all possibilities of known objects in air in the vicinities of the two sightings with negative results.

Conclusion: Unknown.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112—Part II)

On 24 August 1952 while enroute from Travis AFB, California to Turner AFB, Georgia Colonel Gerald W. Johnson, flying on F-84G aircraft, observed two (2) objects in the vicinity of Hermanas, New Mexico (315CM 169CM). These objects appeared to be round in shape, silver in color and approximately six (6) feet in diameter. He conversed with two (2) other pilots in the area between 10 and 11 o'clock. There was no visible means of propulsion and the objects let no trail. One object seemed to change shape from a long gray object while in a right turn. The other object also seemed to change shape when it accelerated very rapidly. This object also seemed to take the shape of a long gray object between two long points when it appeared as a ball. The objects disappeared three (3) minutes from when first observed. After approximately seven (7) minutes the objects reappeared and were over El Paso, Texas (314W 166S). One object seemed to climb straight up to two or three thousand (3000) feet and join another object on close formation.

The observed characteristics of these unidentified objects were such that would lead to no conclusion, however, their speed was so much greater than the 520 MPH indicated Air Speed of the observer and the fact they could quickly disappear on two occasions led no to believe that their flight capabilities were greater than that of any aircraft known to be flying today.

AF FORM 112-PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Heading details partially illegible]

1. Two (2) other objects according to pilot (5) were flying lines abreast approximately four to five hundred yards apart. Change in phase somewhat abrupt when objects were first observed. As long as when observed, objects were noted as long as when "was a ball". The other object continued on its course and eventually vanished gradually. Propulsion system unknown. Speed unknown, observer was travelling at 250 MPH indicating his speed at 35,000 feet altitude. The objects appeared, flew a course parallel with observer and later disappeared. In three other instances, "unknown aerial objects" were observed and disappeared later. The other object which appeared to be silver in color and no rays were visible. In the first sighting the objects resembled two long cigar-shaped objects. In the second sighting the objects resembled a basketball, one object seemed to "evaporate" and the other object came across the observer's nose and joined the other object in close formation.

24 August 1952.

2. The visual observation was made from a B-29 aircraft at 75,000 feet traveling at 250 MPH indicating air speed.

3. First sighted over Hermanas, New Mexico (31.50N 106.02W). Location of object in reference to observer approximately two miles west appearing between ten and eleven o'clock at approximately 270 feet. Then pilot was aware of one of the objects reappeared from the direction from which they had disappeared, the other object came near 35,000 feet and joined in close formation with the other object.

5. Colonel Gerald W. Johnson.

6. Weather 7/8 Clear, few low scattered clouds, winds forecast 31 20 knots at 15,000 feet.

7. None.

8. Not applicable.

9. Interception not attempted due to difference of speed.

10. Location of any air traffic in the general area at the time of the sighting none. No attempt was made to contact El Paso radio concerning any other aircraft in the area which was unsuccessful.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. The last paragraph in Part I of this report is a comment by Colonel Gerald W. Johnson.

2. After mentioning the observer the following information affects the identification of the report:

a. The observer checked his air speed against known air speeds of all previous high speed aircraft.

b. Check was made of the possibility of being in the vicinity of White Sands proving grounds. IF the objects had been from the White Sands testing ground, they would have been easily identifiable. In addition, according to intelligence, several missiles at White Sands are fired north out of the danger area. This would indicate the objects were not from White Sands.

CASE ...O

24 August 1952                                  Hermanas, New Mexico

An AF colonel, flying a jet a/c, observed 2 objects in the vicinity of Hermanas, New Mexico (31 deg 50 min N/108 deg 2 min W). The objects appeared to be round in shape, silver in color and approximately 6" in diameter. He observed them to be approximately 2 miles from him between the hours 1000-1100NST on 24 Aug 52. The first sighting was 1015-1018 NST and the second sighting 1025-1035 NST. There was no visible means of propulsion. One object seemed to change its shape to a long grey object while in a right turn. 1 The object (second object) also seemed to change shape when it accelerated very rapidly. This object also seemed to take the shape of a long grey object twice as long as when it appeared as a ball. The objects disappeared 3 minutes from when first observed. After approximately 7 minutes the objects reappeared at which time the observer was over El Paso, Texas. One object seemed to climb straight up 2 or 3 thousand feet and was joined shortly thereafter by the other one in close formation.

The observed characteristics of these unidentified objects were such that would lead to no conclusion, however, their speed was so much greater than the 250 MPH indicated air speed of the observer and the fact that they could so quickly disappear on two occasions led the reporting officer to believe that their flight capabilities were greater than that of any aircraft known to be flying today.

The ATIC checked all possibilities of known objects in the air in the vicinities of the two sightings with negative results.

Conclusion:
Unknown

Case 710

Two unidentified objects were first observed visually and with binoculars at 1615 POST for a period of 1 hour and 15 minutes. They were described as silver in color, shown circular in shape. They were described as being 60 to 100' in diameter and traveled at an estimated speed of 400 to 450 MPH. No sound was heard. The objects were moving from 3 to W. One object appeared to be at approximately 12,000' and the other at about 13,000'. The two objects moved to the W & approximately 15 miles passing over head of the observers. During this time the object at about 13,000' reportedly dove to the approximate same altitude as the lower objects. When the objects reached a point about 15 miles W of the observers, they began maneuvers similar to an aircraft dogfight. After appearing to disappear into the sun momentarily, the observers then sighted the same 2 objects in the approximate location & at which they were lost from view. During the latter period of observation, 6 additional objects of similar description were observed 25 to 30 miles W of the observers. This made the total size to 8 similar objects observed in this case. These additional 6 objects came into view in pairs - altitudes not estimated by the observers. These objects appeared to be in a dogfight. The observers stated that the objects took up a diamond formation momentarily covering an estimated 4 mile area. The observers also stated that the objects were definitely not a/c and had no vapor trails, exhaust or sound and further stated that it was difficult to follow any one object for any length of time.

The weather officer at Hamilton AFB reported the weather as clear during the time of sighting with approximately 20 miles visibility. The preparing officer stated that this report indicates the possibility that the objects sighted were weather balloons.
