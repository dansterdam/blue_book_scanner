At about 7:00 O'clock, on September the 12, in Greensboro, North Carolina, I saw a large, some what as fire traveling from East to West. It seemed to be bright, glowing mass with a confusing colored tail at least three times the diameter of the ball. I saw in 15 or 20 seconds or three seconds traveling on a downward plate. When it got below apparent tree height it slowed off, but never came up into the air again. It moved to be traveling at 600 miles per hour and perhaps more. The mass or object appeared round and flat, with the flat side down.

I have seen many falling stars and meteors, but this was larger, closer, and different from any I have seen before.

The object appeared to be about a mile and a half away and 12 to 15 feet in diameter.

My seeing this object was not a hallucination as I saw it long enough to call attention to it and saw it also.

On Friday afternoon, September 12, 1952, at dusk my attention was called to an unusual object in the sky. This object was round in shape and white in color with a trailing streamer of a darker color. It was traveling towards the northwest at a very high rate of speed.

My military service consisted of 3Â½ years in the Air Corp. One year was spent instructing machine gun and power turret. My overseas duty was 50 missions with the 15th Air Force as AWPTRP runner.

SUMMARY: (Use same series as original. Give brief summary in first paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Begin last line of report on AF Form 118âPart 12)

A flying object was reported sighted in the Lumberton, North Carolina area 12 September 1952, at 2352.

Four witnesses at four different observation points confirmed its appearance. This report covers sightings from Lake Waccamaw to Fayetteville, North Carolina. The object was traveling SE to NW.

The object was of ball shape with a trail three times the length of the body. The speed was so fast that most witnesses only got a hurried glimpse.

According to the Fayetteville and Raleigh (local) newspapers, a meteor was observed at approximately the same time, day, place, and direction of flight.

(1) A large white object reported to be the size of an automobile giving off a white glowing light at the head and a blue trailing stream at the end. The tail is reported to be of the trail type. This tail was reported by one witness to be 3 times as large as the body of the object. All 3 witnesses described the object traveling at a tremendous speed. In all cases, the object disappeared into the horizon. There is no sound recorded by the witnesses.

(2) Time of sighting - 1900 (2359Â½ time) Eastern Standard Time, 12 September 1952. Object was only sighted for a very few seconds because of speed.

(3) All the sightings were visual.

(4) & (5) a. [Redacted] Lumberton, North Carolina, sighted the object at the above time from the [Redacted] Station located near the Court House in Lumberton, North Carolina.

of the tail of the flying object.

(d) Another person in the vicinity of Lake Waccamaw, a distance of 45
miles from Lumberton, reported sighting same object.

General reliability of witnesses seem to be usually reliable with a probably
true report.

(6) At 1910 Eastern Standard Time, 12 September 1952, scattered clouds at
4000 feet and 14,000 feet. Estimated ceiling was 25,000 feet, visibility 15 miles.
Wind North North East by 4 miles. The last rain reported in the area 1405 Eastern
Standard Time and a generally clear condition 2011 until 2300 Eastern Standard Time.
No reports were made on the winds aloft conditions because of poor weather.

(7) The newspaper, Fayetteville Observer, reported on 13 September, of Fayetteville had seen a huge ball with a tail, heading North West after
1900 Eastern Standard Time 12 September 1952. He reported the color as a greenish-
blue; the newspaper reported the object as a meteor. Several newspapers in Raleigh,
North Carolina, it is reported, carried articles about the sighting of this meteor.

(8) No further visual evidence or photographs are available.

(9) No interceptor action taken.

(10) There is no air traffic in the general area at the reporting time.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. I have interviewed the 3 witnesses mentioned in the above report. All
reports, in my opinion, can be considered reliable. If the report from Lake Waccamaw
now is true, the path followed by the object checks with all of the observations
of the witnesses. This would place the object running South East to North West
15 miles above Lake Waccamaw to a point approximately 10 miles South of Fayetteville,
North Carolina. The witness at the point East of Elizabethtown reported the object
to have a flat trajectory, whereas the other two said that it was definitely curved

Dear Sir:

Enclosed you will find two reports which are self explanatory, these regard the sighting of a strange object in the sky on the night of September, 12 1952. These people reported this sighting to me because they knew no to be active in the Naval Air Reserve and a Naval Aviator. In reporting this matter they asked me what to do about it so I called your office on Saturday morning September 13th and I called with your Major Neal who in turn asked me to handle the matter and secure written statements which are enclosed.

Since obtaining these statements I have talked with several persons who also saw this object and find that the basic description is about the same with all. One of these persons is Lt. Col. in the Army Reserve Corps. One person in the vicinity of Lake Waccamaw a distance of some forty five miles, and another near Bladenboro, N.C. a distance of some twelve miles also reported this object.

If there is any further information you desire me to secure I will be glad to do so.

Very truly yours
