Air Technical Intelligence Center,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Sirs,

I am enclosing a small portion of a large amount of material that apparently fell from the skies in northern Ohio. There is evidence that this could not have been dropped from any nearby road.

My friends, who have sent this to me, asked me for an explanation, and I am forwarding some of the material to you for your evaluation. I have only speculations to give them. You have the ability to give them the facts.

Certainly, I will appreciate your comments and results of your examinations.

Sincerely and respectfully,

[Signature redacted]
