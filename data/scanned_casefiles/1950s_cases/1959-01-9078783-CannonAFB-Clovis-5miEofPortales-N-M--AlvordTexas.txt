(1) (U) ELONGATED CYLINDRICAL WITH APPARENTLY A SHARP NOSE*
(2) APPEARED TO OBSERVER TO BE SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN
(3) SUBCASE OF A 9-52 AIRCRAFT AT THE SAME DISTANCE.
(5) (WHITE) OBSERVER STATES COLOR WAS CLEARLY WHITE AS IF

(5) ONE OBJECT INVOLVED.
(6) OBJECT WAS VIEWED BY OBSERVER IN THE LEFT PILOTS SEAT
OF B-52 AIRCRAFT. THE OBSERVER VIEWED THE OBJECT THROUGH THE
WIND SHIELD OF THE AIRCRAFT. OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED HIGH
AND THE HORIZON THROUGH THE UPPER RIGHT PORTION OF THE WIND
SHIELD. THE OBJECT MOVED IN A FLAT PATH FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.
APPROXIMATELY 50 DEGREES TO 10 THE B-52 FLYING PATH. OBSER-
MATED MAGNETIC HEADING OF OBJECT TO BE 175 DEGREES.
(7) TRAIL OR WISPY VAPOR. NO FLAME WAS OBSERVED. LENGTH OF
THE OBJECT, AND SLIGHTLY LARGER IN DIAMETER, FOLLOWED CLOSELY.
BEHIND THE MOVING OBJECT. NO FLAME WAS OBSERVED. TRAIL APPEARED
TO BE LIGHT GRAY IN COLOR.

(8) NONE AUDIBLE.
(9) DUE TO THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, PART OF THE SKY WAS
DARK. FROM THE OBSERVERS POSITION SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF
THE SKY AREA, AS VIEWED FROM THE LEFT PILOTS SEAT OF THE B-52,
WAS DARK. THE AREA WAS DARKEST TO THE OBSERVERS RIGHT OR TOWARD
THE NORTH WEST. THE AREA TO THE OBSERVERS LEFT WAS STILL
