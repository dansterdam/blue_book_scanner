Feb. 28, 1960

Dear Sirs,

The following is a report of a UFO that I have sighted twice in the last two years. The first time was during the middle of last summer and the previous was on the 15th of March.

I have made a small list of the things that happened during the sightings and the conditions of the sky at the times of the sightings.

The time of the first sighting was about two o'clock in the morning, the day was about July the 18th, the sighting lasted for about ten minutes. It was of course from east to northeast at a speed of about 50 miles per hour. It flew out of the east until it was almost directly over head then it stopped and hovered for about three minutes then it turned and went off to the nw. It had the shape of a large dish about 100 feet in diameter, no noise, reddish blue in color, the sky at the time of the sighting was very clear. There was a moon on the night if that could be of any help.

The second sighting was about on the same order except that it occurred at six-thirty in the evening. This sighting lasted for about five minutes and it flew out of the south to the north directly at a speed of about 50 miles per hour at about 45 degrees above the horizon.

The first time I reported the sighting to the family but I was told to forget it and I did, but after the second sighting I thought that I might see what someone like you would think about it ( I read the book U.F.O.'s ). I am interested in science and when I told anyone that I know my experience they would often laugh and call me a fool or a story teller. What do you think of my story.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted name]
Worthington, Pa.
