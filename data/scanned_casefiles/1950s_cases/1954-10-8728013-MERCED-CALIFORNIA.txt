11. Wing Intelligence Officer, 93d Bomb Wing Comments: In view of the length of time between date of observation and date of report, the preparing officer has no comment as to possible cause of the sighting. Investigation has revealed that the observer, a/c B-47, was on a routine training mission. Capt. B-47 and KC-97 aircraft had taken off from Castle Air Force Base shortly after 1400 PST. However, their location after take off is unknown. S/Sgt [redacted] was in charge, and positive about his observations. He is not a fanatic about flying objects, and has not made a previous report or observation of other unidentified flying objects. This office was not aware that an observation had been made until 8 November. S/Sgt [redacted] was contacted immediately for a report. Contacted 328th Bomb Squadron made a similar observation, but he was not available for interview on the date of this report. In view of the existing lack of information between date of information and date of report, it was felt that S/Sgt [redacted] report should be forwarded immediately.

12. Negative.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

STATEMENT

On the afternoon of 23 October 1954, at approximately 2215 Zulu, I was on the eleventh tee at Merced Country Club Golf Course, with Captain [redacted]. I heard a loud jet noise and at the same time, Captain [redacted] called my attention to an object in the sky. I was facing in an east-southeast direction as I observed a round, white object, about 40 degrees elevation from the horizon, approaching from my left. The altitude was about 1000 to 2000 feet. I was increased with the speed and the jet sound. The noise was similar to that produced when air under high pressure escapes through a small orifice. The object appeared to be about the size of a baseball. It was traveling in a north to south path. I watched it until it disappeared to the south in some clouds above the horizon.

I did not hear any other person at the Country Club mention seeing the object, although there were other persons playing golf at the same time.

I do not recall any air traffic at the time of the observation.
