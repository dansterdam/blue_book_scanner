THREE PLANETS NOW VISIBLE

Venus, Mars and Jupiter are visible on May evenings as the Southern Hemisphere approaches.

BY JAMES STOKLEY

WASHINGTON, May.--The three bright planets, Venus, Mars and Jupiter, are visible in the evening sky this month. All three are best seen in the South on May evenings.

Venus, which appears about three times as bright as the planet Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is now low in the West after sunset. It sets about three hours after the Sun. After that, it will be in the sky earlier in the evening, and will be in the best position for viewing in the middle and late summer months.

Mars is also in the South, but is a reddish-orange object higher in the sky than Venus. It is still a prominent object in the evening sky, but is gradually becoming smaller and dimmer as the Earth pulls away from it in its orbit.

Jupiter, the largest planet, is higher still, and appears as a brilliant white object. It is best seen in the South on May evenings.

In addition to Mars and Venus, even Saturn is visible on May evenings, but it is low in the West and sets soon after the Sun.

Looking to the right of the meridian, the star groups Virgo and Libra are prominent in the South. The bright star Arcturus, yellowish in color, is to the northwest. Other conspicuous stars in the South are Spica, Antares, and Altair.

On May 15, Jupiter will be in opposition. This means that it will rise at sunset and set at sunrise, since the Earth will be between it and the Sun. At this time, it will be closest to the Earth, and will appear largest and brightest.

DIMENSIONS OF JUPITER

Through a telescope, the planet Jupiter reveals many interesting details. Its equatorial diameter is about 88,000 miles, more than 11 times the diameter of the Earth. However, its average density is only about one-fourth that of the Earth, indicating that it is composed largely of gases.

The planet rotates rapidly, completing a full turn in less than 10 hours. This rapid rotation causes the planet to bulge at the equator, so that it is not a perfect sphere. The polar diameter is about 5,000 miles less than the equatorial diameter.

Jupiter has a number of satellites, or moons, the four largest of which were discovered by Galileo in 1610. These moons, Callisto, Ganymede, Io and Europa, range in diameter from about 2,000 to 3,400 miles.

The movement of these moons is one of the most interesting features of Jupiter's system. Their positions and eclipses can be observed with a small telescope. This study has enabled astronomers to make accurate determinations of the mass of Jupiter and the dimensions of its orbit.

Text output:

Jupiter's 'Sissy' Region
There are would seem to be a large of Tupiter's' satellites which exhibit rather strange performances. These are known as the "Siasies', and have been spotted by observers over many years from various parts of the world. Whey they have been dubbed as such would need the reasoning of some astronomy mind to unravel.
The "Sissied" are described as being faster and farther away from Jupiter than the normal satellites, and with changes in speed and also in their orbits not easily explained. Their orbits are described a3 irregular and eratic, with periods of rapidly, then slowly, and then widely distanced from the planet. 
When they appear to be the greatest distance or at apogee from Jupiter, the Wop of the "sissy" ones are as bright as the moons Saturn, and could be easily seen with a small glass, while the next ones, at lesser distances. are hardly visible at all. They give the impression of being attached in some indefinable fashion to the planet. yet having independent motions of their own. This consists of swiftly and erratically, and capriciously dashing in and out, and around the planet, which have been observed by analysts of Jupiter's behavior over many years.

ATTENTION: PROJECT BLUE BOOK
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
OHIO

Gentlemen:
This report is to make my observation available to your office for any use it may have concerning the object I observed or any other similar observations. This object was observed by several people on the evening of May 21, 1959, for a period of approximately 45 minutes.

The object was first observed at approximately 9:10 P.M. local time as it passed over the southwestern part of Ashland, Oregon. It was moving rapidly in a northeast direction at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and had a bright glow about its perimeter. The object seemed to wobble slightly as it moved across the sky, and the speed of its movement was estimated to be approximately 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour.

As the object moved into the northeastern part of the sky, it appeared to slow down and then came to a complete stop. It remained stationary for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. During this time, the object appeared to change shape slightly, becoming more elliptical in appearance. At one point, the object also seemed to emit a pulsating or flashing light. After remaining stationary for this period, the object then resumed its rapid movement toward the northeast, disappearing from sight in less than a minute.

The weather conditions at the time of the observation were clear, with scattered high clouds. There was no wind at the surface. The object was observed by several people, including myself, and all of us were amazed at the speed and the maneuvers of the object. We all agreed that it was not an aircraft or any other known type of aerial vehicle.

I hope this report may be of some use to your office in its investigations of similar sightings. If you have any questions or require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

Transcribing the text in the image:

Aviation, at any rate, holds be a very good subject. we see it as a war-like thing but our modern forms are of a very beneficent character compared to the machines of yesterday. The aeroplanes are now designed not only for speed and maneuverability but also for safety, comfort, and efficiency. There are many marvellous developments in this field.

Our attention was first called to a night sighting about 10 o'clock on the evening of October 26th in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands in the North Pacific. The sighting was at an estimated altitude of about 20,000 feet and the object appeared to be of a brilliant intense light. It was moving rapidly at an estimated speed of about 700 mph. The light was a steady, non-blinking white light, the intensity of which was so great that it was clearly visible through the overcast cloud cover, estimated to be about 3,000 feet. The light was visible for approximately 5 minutes. After this time, it appeared to accelerate and suddenly disappear from view.

Now you're wondering what all this means. It seems to be an interesting account of a strange aerial sighting. However, without further details and investigation, it's difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the nature of the observed object. The text simply describes the sighting, but does not provide enough information to determine whether it was an unusual natural phenomenon, a classified military aircraft, or something else entirely. More context would be needed to make a proper assessment.

20 May 59

This report is concerned with a possible air defense situation which occurred over the North Pacific Ocean near the Hawaiian Islands on 8 May 1959.

At approximately 1715 Hawaiian Standard Time on 8 May 1959, radar operators of a Pacific Air Defense sector control center detected a radar target at a range of approximately 900 miles north-northwest of the Hawaiian Islands. The target was tracked for approximately 30 minutes until it faded from the radar display.

During the tracking period, the target exhibited erratic flight characteristics, such as extremely rapid acceleration and deceleration, as well as abrupt changes in direction of flight. The target's speed was estimated to vary from 1,000 to 8,000 knots.

Several attempts were made to establish radio contact with the target, but without success. Attempts were also made to scramble interceptor aircraft to investigate the target, but the interceptor aircraft were unable to attain sufficient speed to make contact.

Text from the document:

The object was first observed at 2300 hours, 7 May 1959, by the pilot of a USAF C-130 Hercules aircraft, flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet, over the North Pacific, approximately 1200 miles West of the Hawaiian Islands. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes and was described as follows:

1. The object appeared to be approximately 50-75 feet in length and approximately 15-20 feet in width. It was a long, cylindrical object with no wings or visible means of propulsion.

2. The object was observed to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, estimated between 1500-2000 mph. It was observed to make several abrupt changes in direction, making 90 degree turns on several occasions.

3. The object was observed to ascend rapidly from sea level to an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet in a matter of seconds.

4. The object emitted a bright, pulsating, greenish-white light which illuminated the surrounding area. No sound was heard by the observer.

5. The object disappeared from view when it reached an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet.

13 July 1959. B-52B - Hawaii Flight.
This report concerned a sighting of unknown light (s) seen by the crew of a B-52B aircraft on a training mission over the north Pacific off the Hawaiian Islands. 
The sighting occurred at approximately 1:00 a.m. (local time).
The crew reported that they observed a bright light, which appeared to be larger than a star and seemed to be accompanied by three smaller lights. 
The lights were observed for about 3 to 5 minutes before disappearing.
The crew estimated the object(s) to be at an altitude of about 20,000 feet, and the lights were said to be stationary and motionless in relation to the aircraft.
No definite conclusions were reached regarding the identity of the light(s). The report was forwarded to the Air Force Directorate of Intelligence for further analysis.

Captain rockwell c. smith, us army, air force, received a report of a sighting from a major of the 8th army flight test section from fort shafter, honolulu, t.h. concerning observations made by himself and a captain, also of the 8th army flight test section, on 8 may 1959. the report states:

1. on 8 may 1959, at approximately 1520 hours, the undersigned (major, 8th army flight test section) and captain x (also of the 8th army flight test section) were conducting a visual search for a radio controlled model airplane which had crashed near kaneohe bay, oahu, t.h. 

2. during the course of this search, both the undersigned and captain x observed an unidentified aerial object at an approximate altitude of 10,000 feet. the object was estimated to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter and oval shaped. the object was traveling in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 500-600 knots. the object was observed for approximately 30-45 seconds before it disappeared from view.

3. no known aircraft or missiles in use at the time.

as the object was sighted, it appeared to be bright and luminous. the object did not appear to be reflecting sunlight, but rather seemed to be generating its own light. there were no exhaust trails or sounds associated with the object. the weather at the time was clear with unlimited visibility.

the object was sighted by two reliable and experienced observers, both of whom are officers in the united states army. the object observed could not be readily identified as any known aircraft or satellite in use at the time.

The elapsed time from first observation to disappearance was approximately | | | seconds. 
The light appeared to be the same color as a magnesium flare, and was observed to be slightly brighter than the background sky. No sound was heard.
D. Conclusions:
It is the opinion of this office that this is the object responsible, if all of these sightings are relayed correctly and objectively. This was an aerial phenomenon of some type, possibly a meteor or other natural phenomenon. No further investigation appears to be warranted and the case is considered closed.
