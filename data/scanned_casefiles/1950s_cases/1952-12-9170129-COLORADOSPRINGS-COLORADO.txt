Colorado Springs, Colorado                                                4 December 1952

I. Description of Incident

An Air Force sergeant and a civilian sighted a round aluminum colored object flying east to west. It appeared to be changing shape as it proceeded out of sight to the west. The approximate time of sighting was 1100-1200 EST, for 1 minute of duration. The two men state that the object was going slightly faster than a conventional jet aircraft, but did have a perceptible aluminum hue. No sound was heard as a large machine was operating at close range. While the object was overhead, several right angle turns were made without apparent slowing of speed.

II. Discussion of Incident

Aircraft in the area included B-29's and B-50's as well as a Camp Carson observation plane. The B-29's and B-50's are ruled out as a possibility since they were on a south heading 7 minutes after the sighting took place.

The observation plane, however, was in the area at the exact time of observation, and on a westerly heading. The changing shape, which happened only once, could have been the bright mid-day sun reflecting from this aircraft. The weather conditions were CAVU.

III. Conclusions

Possibly aircraft.

This image appears to be a topographical map with contour lines representing terrain elevation. The map is divided into grid sections numbered 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 81, 82, and 83. There are various lines, both solid and dotted, crossing through the different grid sections. The map seems to show a landscape with varying elevations and terrain features. Some text is visible, such as "BM" (likely benchmark) and what appears to be "SQUAW CREEK" at the bottom of the map, but most of the details are represented by contour lines and elevation markings.

The image appears to be a low-quality, black and white scanned document that looks like a topographical or geological map with grid lines and elevation markers. However, the text is largely illegible due to the poor scan quality and high contrast of the image. Some numbers are visible along the left side of the image (such as 4237, 132, 131, 130), but no complete words or sentences can be clearly read.

The image appears to be a black and white map or aerial photograph divided into a grid. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor quality of the scan. There are some faint numbers visible on the right side of the image, but they are not clearly readable. The image seems to show a landscape with various terrain features, possibly trees or geographical contours, but the details are obscured by the low image quality.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States    REPORT NO: [Blank]
AREA REPORTED: Colorado Springs, Colorado    FROM: [Partially obscured]
DATE OF REPORT: 9 December 1952    DATE OF INFORMATION: 5 December 1952    SOURCE: G-2    EVALUATION: [Obscured]

REFERENCES: Msg, Hq USAF, Attn: AFOIN-4B2.6 December 1952

SUMMARY: (Enter main summary of report, give identifying data such as date, time, location, number of objects, brief description)

A flying object was noticed approximately 1100-1200 hours, 4 December 1952, movement was noticed to SE approx 20 miles from the west. This observation was made to the objects and the following was noted:

a. The object was round, approximately 20 feet in diameter, aluminum colored, no markings noted. No sounds were noticeable but this could have been caused by the fact that a more careful investigation might have revealed something. It was traveling at approximately 300-400 miles per hour in an altitude of 5000 - 6000 feet. Object was proceeding west to east. Sergeant states no known conventional aircraft could have been traveling in this manner. Sergeant states the object appeared to be tumbling and over-end. Both witnesses state a stubborn ball that seem held in the hand and expressed, "Judged our best guess was a weather balloon". Witnesses state this may have been caused by dipping of the object.

2. The witnesses state that the object passed directly overhead and not south of them as originally supposed.

3. The supervisor states subject is very reliable, extremely reliable, and he can vouch for the flying ability. Considerable discussion was made, reliable, nature, and prone to tell the truth.

Narrative Statement of Unidentified Flying Object

On Thursday December 4, 1952 at approximately 1100 hours, Sergeant [redacted] at Colorado Springs Filtering Center was called by a civilian to a sighting.

The object was circular in shape, aluminum colored, 20 to 30 feet in diameter, 6,000 to 8,000 feet in altitude, travelling at 600 to 800 miles per hour. Close from the East passed directly overhead and disappeared into the West.

Some arresting motion was noticed while overhead. Two or three times the object made single turns without changing speed.

A momentary pulsation or projection out from one side was noticed two or three times (could have been caused by slipping).

The object disappeared into the West at about some altitude.

Narrative Statement of Unidentified Flying Object

About 1200 hours of the 4th of December 1952 I was talking to a man on the Infiltration Course No. 2 on Camp Carson, Colorado, when I noticed an object moving across the sky at a high rate of speed. I took it to be a Jet of some sort at first. I noticed the object for a few seconds when it seemed to rise so high to our left and then right back on the same line it was on at first. The object seemed to be round in shape and to clip over and over. There was no trail and there was no noise. It seemed to be made of some bright metal. There was an 1-5 flying around to the west of us and the object was moving from the west to west. The object passed in an over the small plane. I watched the object for about a minute. I could not judge how big the object was or how fast it was. I do not know what this object was but, I do know that it was like no other aircraft that I have seen.
