TIFFIN, OHIO                                     17 November 1957                                     HOAX

A science teacher from Tiffin, Ohio observed a flash of light while driving home from work. The following day he went to the area where he saw the flash and claimed to have found an object in a field resembling SPUTNIK. The Teacher contacted the Toledo, Ohio Police, and the story was given space by Toledo newspapers. ATIC received this information from the Pentagon because of press inquiries regarding the incident.

On 4 December, investigators from Project Blue Book contacted the witness and obtained the object. This object was a copper colored metallic sphere, approximately eight inches in diameter, with a single antenna. Further analysis at Wright-Patterson revealed that a small radio was bent into a "V" shape, so as to fit inside two thin copper shells, and held together by a bolt. Heat had been applied to the radio to scorch and blacken the set in contrast to the outside of the sphere. A short piece of speedometer cable was attached to give the appearance of an antenna. The object was bolted together with an American Standard Threads bolt and the radio tubes were American made.

The incident is regarded as an attempt at a deliberate hoax.
