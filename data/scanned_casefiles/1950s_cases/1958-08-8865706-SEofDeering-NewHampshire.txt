RW 054     OI-34/Maj Tucker/mhb/7829

22 December 1959

Dear Mrs. [redacted]

Your recent letter addressed to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio concerning an unidentified flying object sighted by your family in August 1958 has been referred to this Office.

This is evidentially the same sighting you referred to in your November letter to this office, which sighting was determined to be too old to effect a valid evaluation.

However, since you feel that this sighting was significant, I am enclosing two United States Air Force questionnaires which should be filled out in detail by you and your husband. When the questionnaires are completed, please send them directly to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Sincerely,

On August 27, 1958, while vacationing at our summer home located in East Deering NH - My family and I decided to go to an auction to be held in Dunbarton (See enclosed bulletin). Our home is located high among the rocky hills of this area - elevation about 1100 ft.

After lunch we drove upgrade and along the ridge line of a large hill near - then the road turns sharply to the left - here for about 200 yds. the grade of descent is very steep - about 40 yrs from horizon to off to our right the hill falls away to expose a beautiful view (Birds-eye) of 1/2 to 1 1/2 miles in width. bordered with a heavy tree line on the far side - rolling hills and a view of a distant peak.

It is customary for me to always look at this vista and comment about it. As I did this note - One Sunday after Mass we returned

Here is the text from the document:

from Hillsboro N.H. along a road that runs through the
defile, and I observed an Air Force plane flying overhead. At the
time he was at 500 ft more or less - it appeared to me at the
time, that as he was lower than the hilly country with that
it was strictly a pleasure hop (a Sunday, divine pilots). Twenty
minutes or so later, when we reached the spot of our observation
I was unable to see that the plane was still in the confines
of the valley even, and that we - in the car were slightly there
than in the plane. It was a thrill for me, as I've always considered myself
a "questionable" pilot. Incidentally, I place these light planes (paper & Air waves)
as descent the steep hill (Claremont after a stop - on the road (ahead) and on her to
quite nicely way to my car jiggling to clunk the upgrade, one of my youngster
said - look - "look - what is that?" - I stopped and we all instantly saw the
some flying saucer - then were scrutiny - no words were found coming - to
look the I flying saucer - then were scrutiny - I'm scared the the. After it hank
using - no land - it's going to crash - I'm scared the the. After I hank
round from view - right just to point, behind or through trees, I could
call one in turn - "what did you see" not offering any comments or suggestion
The conclusion was unanimous - "like two saucers, one on top of the other
had upside down - no wing - no tail - no such - no windows - color
really - orange. Remember we were looking down on this object and could
see the entire outline, both in diameter and side view.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

I was so amazed at this spectacle, that I sat there for several minutes - to assure myself that I could not have been an apparition - and that I wanted to be impressed this vision in my mind. In the event - that if and as I expect later object crashed in the wood land - that upon its discovery and revealing buy its guides or other watchers, that I could tell of its movement, as I saw them. Then we proceeded to the auction -

On our return, I inquired of several farmers & country friends if they had heard any reports of strange craft or a crash if they had - and when I told my version - they like all normal people, would look askance and say nothing - I believe to them, I am suspected for my intelligence and personal dignity.

I made these same remarks (as you the reader of this note) what can be said? I decided to say no more - hoping that during the coming Bird & Deer hunting season, that hunters would come upon this wreckage (if any) in the woods - nothing has been reported to my knowledge, so I will say little more to anyone.

Let me state here emphatically that I certify that what I declare I saw, I really did see, and no one - I repeat, no one, can change my opinion - If it was not a secret weapon of our country - it was a foreign foreign

Based object!

It appeared to me to be either control landing or a
slim glide of a metal object, that could have burned up
coming through outer space and was gliding to a crash.

I request that if your office is interested - I would be
glad - especially when the flying is out - to have an Air
Force representative meet me, and I will show the break,
direction of flight - altitude - point of losing vision - and if
it were necessary or thought desirable, we could buy scales
have a light recon place of copter fly over the course.

I really now, the effect of this time loss, but one does
not enjoy soundly fruitless - and it wasn't until we saw the
news of unidentifiable flying objects, that our thoughts clang that
his were brought back, and I miss (my wife) thought we
should tell of these experience.

Dear Sir:

I wonder if you would be interested in a sight my husband and six children and I saw on a day in August 1958.

We were in our car high on a dirt road on the side of a hill overlooking a valley which was heavily wooded.

We all saw it about the same time. A flying object elliptical in shape and it was not a plane. It had no windows or wings or rudder of any sort. It was a luminous orange color. It was from the distance we were, about the size of a plane but it could have been bigger. It disappeared into the tree tops on the horizon which was below us. It was going at such a speed that if it had been a plane it would have crashed. There is no airfield there where it descended, as we asked about that later.

We watched it disappear and then drove to our destination which was an auction at Dunstable New Hampshire. We were in Deering, N. H. when we saw the object.

We never reported it fearing we would be ridiculed.

Yours sincerely,

My husband a Major of Infantry during world war II will attest that it was a flying saucer.

Dear Mrs. [redacted]

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your recent letter concerning an Unidentified Flying Object seen by your family in August 1958. Unfortunately, this sighting is so old that it would be impossible to effect a valid evaluation of just what you did see.

There is no U. S. Air Force or Department of Defense documentary film on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. Therefore, the film you saw must have been a commercial or Hollywood enterprise.

The Air Force must be objective in its analysis and evaluation of UFO sightings. For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of press release on this subject which clearly states the Air Force position.

Thank you very much for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
