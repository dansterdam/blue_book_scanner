Strange Lights Flash, Dance
Over 11 Towns In Indiana

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 7 — (UP)—Strange lights flashed and flickered over Indiana during a four-hour today.

Witnesses at 11 towns, including state and local police, reported they saw colored lights dipping, flashing and changing hue like traffic signals across the sky.

State troopers hustled between 12:15 a.m., when the first report came in from Anderson, Ind., until late last alarm at 5:34 a.m. near the Ohio border.

In between they were alerted to watch out for lights over Alexandria, Yorktown, Hartford City, Pendleton, Muncie, Greenwood, Tipton and Kokomo.

All the police could establish was that is appeared at least two objects were moving across the area—one flashing from Anderson to Portland, in the general direction of Ohio and the other racing northwest from Greenwood to Kokomo.

They also drew up a log of the lights, which drew up included:

1:54 — Anderson saw object red, white and blue.

1:59 — Hartford City reported overhead green and blue lights, traveling northwest; in two segments, green on top and blue on bottom.

1:14 — Greenwood police car reported object standing still in sky about five minutes, showing white lights and flashing red and green lights.

1:28 — Trooper Jack Beauvis stated object moving directly over Pendleton Police Force base. Notified base.

1:51 — Portland reported object still sighted northeast and that District 5 in Ohio had picked up object on radar between 5:00 and 5:000 feet but was unable to identify.

Strange Lights Flash, Dance
Over 11 Towns In Indiana

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 7.—(UP)—Strange lights flashed and flickered over Indiana during a four-hour period today. Residents of at least 11 towns, including state and local police, reported they saw colored lights, clippering, flashing and dancing over the countryside in the Indiana heavens.

In between they were alerted to watch out for lights over Alexandria, Yorktown, Hartford City, Muncie, Greenwood, Elwood, Tipton and Kokomo.

All the police could establish was that is appeared at least two hours, from 10:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., when the first report came in from Anderson, Ind., near the Bunker Hill Air Force base from Portland, Ind., near the Ohio border.

They also drew on a log of the lights, which highlighted the northeast sparkling, and turning red, white and blue.

1:01—Hartford City reported overhead green and blue light traveling northeast in two segments, green on top and blue on bottom.

1:14—Greenwood police car reported object speeding all in sky for about five minutes, steady white lights and flashing red and green lights.

1:25—Pioneer Jack Beauvois west towards Bunker Hill Air Force base. Notified base.

1:51—Portland reported object still slanted northeast and that District 5 in Ohio had picked up object on radar between 5,000 and 5,500 feet but was unable to identify.

JECTS THROW
INTO DITHER
'Saucers' Reported
in Many Places
By BILL ROBERTS

One or more unidentified flying objects, flashing red, blue, green and white lights, hovered over north central Indiana early today and sent residents scurrying to their telephones.

City police, Marion County sheriff's office and state police switchboards were swamped with calls as the objects were reported seen from Indianapolis northward as far as Portland.

A mysterious object was seen by state police received first reported near Montpelier, which was the central Indiana cities and towns between midnight and 3 a.m.

In Marion County, the sheriff's office handled more than 1,000 telephone inquiries. Several deputies also reported seeing the object.

BUNKER HILL BASE
Bunker Hill Air Base near Peru for Bakalar Air Base near Columbus could shed any light on the mystery.

TOWNS REPORT
Some reports said the object was moving northwestward. Later, others said it was moving westward.

Along with Indianapolis, reports came from Anderson, Decatur, Greenfield, Kokomo, Elwood, Tipton, Muncie, Yorktown, Ft. Wayne, Danville, Greenwood, Hartford City and even from Ohio state line.

Speculation included everything from a flying saucer to a UFO tanker.

But most of the calls were similar. The object hovered at an altitude of 3,000 feet and appeared to be stationary at times. There were flashing lights. Some observers said the object changed colors, others claimed it sparkled.

Suggestions that it was the balloon from the Marion County Fair night were ruled out since the object was seen long after the balloonist parachuted down at 10:30 p.m.

SEEN SEVERAL
PLACES AT ONCE

Other calls at the same time placed it in the vicinity of Carmel and near Alexandria.

At 12:54 a.m. a report from Anderson said the object was about the size of a star, turning red, white and blue. Then it disappeared and a few minutes later, saying it was in the northeast, flickering pale blue and pink.

Next call came from Hartford City. The report said the object was seen top and side of the bottom and appeared to be in two segments.

At 1:04 a.m. Trooper Jack Appleby advised the object was near Albany and was changing colors. A few minutes later he reported "it was dancing up and down and giving off bright lights."

August 21, 1957

Headquarters United States Air Force,
Washington, D. C.

Gentlemen:

So many observers of UFO's in North Central Indiana the night of Aug. 7 certainly adds a significant chapter to the history of this mysterious subject.

There is light to my sons perhaps in a much simpler way. And I wonder whether some of these people realize what they saw. I saw a strange white, blue and reddish object. I am certain that I have seen this thing on several occasions.

Over Washington will be remembered the wave of July 1952 and that the year was remarkable for UFO sightings. Well, on the evening of July 19, 1957, a strange object appeared. A strange light speed toward a point about 10 miles an hour. Another object was observed in the newspapers. The object of my UFO was not a conventional shape. I was impressed by a large cylinder with a flashing, firered forward and.

Now, reports of eyewitnesses with blank-faced missiles in watch a large percentage of friction-caused heat in throw off the wave. After some time to associate our visitor with this principle.

Respectfully,

[Signature redacted]

Dear [Name redacted]:

Thank you for your letter of 21 August 1957.

Your observations concerning the star capella undoubtedly are correct.

For your information are including a press release and a copy of the summary of our Project Bluebook Special Report Mr Ul.

Hoosiers Sight Flying 'Object'

An unidentified flying object, in four gorgeous colors and a shower of white light, was reported cavorting across Central Indiana skies early today.

It disappeared in the dawn after having been sighted over Decatur, Alexandria, Carmel, Yorktown, Anderson, Muncie, Sharpsboro City, Pendleton, Albany, Portland, Greenwood, Indianapolis, Tipton, Kokomo and Ft. Wayne.

IN THE PERIOD between 12:18 a.m. and 2 a.m. it was reported traveling up, down and sideways in the general direction of Detroit, lighting the sky with combinations of red, white and green: pale blue and pink; red, white and blue, and a two-toned green over blue.

It was not an airplane for state police and the Air Force.

Nobody, including state police and the Air Force, could explain it.

Everybody said it was something.

It was described by two newspaper men in the Pendleton region—Jack Applegate and Jack Richman—who saw it.

Marion County Sheriff's Deputy Marshall Moore said he observed it at 1 a.m. high over the intersection of German Church Rd. and 10th St.

HE SAID IT glowed red, white and blue and was "going up and down."

"It might have been revolving, too," he said.

"It could have been a star, but it appeared to be closer to earth than any star I ever saw," he said. "It definitely was not a plane."

Deputy Moore said he watched it from 1 a.m. until daylight. Then he couldn't see it any more, he said.

At one point, state police said they thought it was an aircraft in an aerial refueling operation. They said they learned a refueling plane had been operating out of Bunker Hill Air Force Base at Peru.

But reports on the mysterious object continued to come in across the plane was said to have landed.

A BUNKER HILL spokesman said the object didn't belong to Bunker Hill.

He said the base received a number of telephone calls about the object but could not find it on radar and couldn't spot it in the sky.

"We didn't scramble any aircraft," he said.

He said the object's course was plotted on the basis of reports received from outgoing communities and "it appeared to be heading for Detroit."
