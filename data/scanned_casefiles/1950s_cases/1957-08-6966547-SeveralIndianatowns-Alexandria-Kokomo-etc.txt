Strange Lights Flash, Dance Over 11 Towns In Indiana
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug, 7—(Special)—Strange flying objects were reported in the skies over at least 11 Indiana towns between 12:10 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. this morning. according to Area Police and monitoring stations.
The objects were reportedly seen and reports came from Anderson, Alexandria, Elwood, Kokomo, Greenwood, Muncie, Pendleton, Fortville, Columbus, and Shelbyville. 
In between these were sighted in various towns, including Hartford City, Tipton, Alexandria, Elwood, Kokomo, Greenwood, Shelbyville, Muncie, Pendleton, Fortville and Columbus. 
Observers reported the objects were traveling at high speeds, varying from "hovering" to "darting away" at tremendous speeds. They were described as brightly lighted objects varying in color from white to orange which would blaze a trail and then suddenly disappear and reappear at another location.
An Anderson policeman, Don Anderson, said he saw an object at 1:45 a.m. which was "perfectly round and had a small red light in the center" which traveled at an estimated speed of 500 m.p.h.  
The Greenwood police car reported having a close encounter with one of the objects at about 2:15 a.m.  The object hovered close to the police car and emitted a bright blinding light that made it impossible for the officer to see. The object then raced away at tremendous speed.
As yet, no agency had an explanation for the phenomena.

The local police could not identify the aerial objects that appeared at least two and possibly three nights in a row over several Indiana communities. They termed them "floating electric lights" and "strange flashing lights".

JECTS THROW INTO DITHER

'Saucers' Reported 
in Many Places

One or more unidentified flying objects, flashing red, blue, green and white lights, hovered over north central Indiana early today and sent residents scurrying to their telephones.

State police at the Marion County sheriff's office said the objects were sighted from Indianapolis northward as far as Portland.

They were reported from Alexandria, Kokomo, Elwood, Jonesboro, Gas City and Muncie. Some described them as circular in shape, others said they were cone-shaped.

At 12:24 a.m. a report from Alexandria said the objects moved about rapidly and seemed to be changing color as they did so. Some reports said the objects came in clusters and that there were five or six at one time.

Along with Indianapolis, residents from Gas City, Anderson, Muncie and Kokomo reported seeing the objects.

A state police bulletin included reports saying the lights seemed to be going off and on. There were flashing lights of many colors. The objects were reported moving at a high rate of speed.
Officers at the Marion County jail reported that most of the calls were made from frightened residents about the mystery objects.

There were flashing lights described as both green and red in color and moving at a fast rate of speed. Some said the objects were hovering and seemed to be giving off a possible gas or vapor. 

Indications that it was not just one object were that the reports came from several towns in an area of at least 100 miles.

The following information is submitted in regard to reports of
unidentified flying objects seen on the night of August 4, 1957,
in the above-mentioned Indiana towns.
At approximately 9:30 PM, EST, August 4, 1957, a resident of
Alexandria, Indiana, reported seeing a bright light in the sky
over that town. The light was described as being bright white in
color and about the size of a baseball at arm's length. It was
observed moving in a northwesterly direction and after a few
minutes disappeared from view.
Almost simultaneously, other reports were received from Kokomo,
Peru, Marion and Winchester, Indiana, concerning similar sightings
of unidentified objects in the sky. The descriptions given of the
objects were generally the same as that from Alexandria. The
objects were reported as being bright white lights, larger than a
star, moving rapidly and erratically, and then disappearing from

BLUFDA, Indiana
August 21, 1957

TO: RECORD AIR FORCE

This report is a copy of a report I made on this date.

On 12 August 1957, at about 2315 hours, I was in the yard in back of my home, when I observed a bright light cross the sky from the northeast to the northwest at a high rate of speed. The light was so bright that it illuminated the area for a moment. After observing the light for a few seconds, I went into the house and told my wife that I had just seen a flying object of some kind. I do not know what it was, but it was not an aircraft of any kind that I am familiar with. It was not the usual type of aircraft with running lights, etc. This light was a single, extremely bright light that streaked across the sky. It appeared to be high, but I do not know its exact altitude. I am submitting this report on the incident.

Respectfully,
[Signature redacted]

Flying 'Object'

An unidentified flying object, in four gorgeous colors and almost as large as a house, was reported swarming across the sky near several Indiana towns today.

The strange object, said to have disappeared in the dawn after having been sighted over Alexandria, Kokomo, Anderson and other cities in central Indiana, was described in detail by eyewitnesses.

IN THE PERIOD between 12:45 a.m. and 3 a.m. it was reported traveling up, down and sideways in the air.

The "unidentified object" reported over Muncie early today was identified as a B-36 "flying tanker" state police officers said. There were no "green, blue, white and red" colors mentioned in any of the same "object" sightings at other towns.

Explosion of Dazzling Lighting like sky with combinations of red, white and green pale flashes and quivering, wavering motions were described by the witnesses.

Near Alexandria, Kokomo and Anderson, according to Jack M. Herson, a Kokomo attorney, the object hovered and manoeuvered for several minutes.

According to Deputy Sheriff Roscoe Pattison, who watched it from 3 a.m. until daylight, "it didn't seem to be an aircraft in an aerial refueling operation. They said they watched a revolving searchlight beam coming from the object."

Deputy Pattison said he watched it from 3 a.m. until daylight. "I couldn't see it any more, he said.

A BAKER HILL, a businessman, said the object didn't leave any trail as it moved swiftly through the sky. "It was doing things no known aircraft could do," he said.

"It had a peculiar pink and orange color and would change shape. Sometimes it would appear as a round, glowing object, and then change as you watched it," Hill added.
