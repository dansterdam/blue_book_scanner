AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: Lt. G. E. St., 5th Street Rec. Wg., (CI)
Travis Air Force Base, Calif.

The following report is submitted as the result of an interview with Pro
Clifford W. Smith, AF15613938, 4th Lt. Armament and Electronics Squadron, 9th
Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Heavy, Travis Air Force Base, California, on 1
January 1952.

6 January 1952 between the hours of 0530 and 0630 the informant sighted
an unidentified flying object while on duty as a navigator in a B-29 aircraft
flying at night. It was very dark out clear, the moon was not visible however a light,
large, oval or round was observed over the area. Smith was alone at the time and
there were no witnesses. Witness was in the vicinity. He was within the Travis
Air Force Base in front of the Heavy Housing Area when he sighted the unidentified
object moving on a relative bearing approximately to 9-o'clock (9) degrees to the
left from the aircraft (3) with distance at an altitude of approximately (300) feet.
The unidentified object appeared to be a tear drop shaped object moving across the
area. It was a large area at the time. A self-same estimated arc sight dirty (50)
feet long, shooting out large sharp bright light. A total approximately 15-20 degrees
to be south from the west of the unidentified object. During the period of sighting
the object (3) seemed to descend about 210° (3) feet in the vicinity of the unidentified
object he sighted and was moving to either a right or left of the viewing.

REPORT NO. 8
PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

The following report is submitted as the result of an interview with Pfc. Will M. Jackson, 1st Electronic Surveyor, 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Heavy, Travis Air Force Base, California, on 5 January 1952:

On 4 January 1952 between the hours of 0500 and 0550 the informant sighted what appeared to be an unidentified flying object. The weather during the time of sighting was very dark and clear, the moon was still however a high, broken, overcast was observed over the area. (Redacted) was alone at the time and there were no nearby witnesses seen in the vicinity. He was walking east on Travis Avenue in front of the Worry Housing Area when he sighted the unidentified object heading on a relative bearing approximately forty-five (45) degrees to the left about one-quarter (1/4) mile distant at an estimated altitude of three thousand (3000) feet. The unidentified object was seen going forward and downward at an extremely high rate of speed described as being comparable to that of a jet type aircraft coming down out of the clouds. To the unidentified object appeared to be a dark gray phosphorescent very bright green in color lighting up a large area at the time. A red flame estimated as about thirty (30) feet long shooting out large phosphorescent colored sparks appeared to the observer to be coming from the rear of the unidentified object. During the period of sighting between fifteen (15) to thirty (30) seconds the unidentified object seemed to swirl to descend about fifty (50) feet in altitude from the initial sighting position. There was no sound heard or crash observed during the sighting. The observer stated he is familiar with the appearance of meteors and shooting stars and that the unidentified object he sighted had no resemblance to either of the foregoing.

Subj: UFO Investigation

To: Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

Reference: 1. Your letter 22 May 1968, subject, UFO Investigations, I have the following comments on all the cases you have listed, in the order they were listed.

1. 7 January 1952, Palmer, Alaska.

I have rated this case E3 C7, meaning that as far as strangeness was concerned, the stimulus giving rise to this report could have been something quite ordinary or it could have fallen into the category of "strange-shaped Ufos". Reported from many countries and which have no ready explanation. In this instance, we have not sufficient information to go on. The report we have states, "Alaska Air Command Informed and will take further investigative action," and, "additional data will be forwarded when available". To the best of my knowledge the further data were never transmitted. This plus the fact that it was reported by one woman out of 4 or 5 (not 45 as the original report stated) and the fact that it was observed at the time of the setting sun, leads me to think that the sighting might have had a meteorological, but data insufficient for firm evaluation" as my recommendation for this classification.

2. 14 April 1952, LaCrosse, Wisconsin.

I originally asked to review this case in the hopes that unknown to me some additional followup had been made. I found that despite the fact that a captain of commercial airliner and others
