AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

5 August 1953
PREPARED BY (Officer)    DIST & G V AINSLEY                                    SOURCE
                Cincinnati, Ohio

On 3 August 1953, at approximately 2130 - 2200 hours, and and
Gentile Air Force Depot employees, reported seeing two objects in
the air while on the way to Menie, Ohio. Objects were sighted on Brockville
Road near the Gentile Air Force Depot and in Sheridan Cemetery. No shape was discerned
as only lights were seen. Objects were noticeable for approximately 15 - 20
minutes and then moved in a gradual curve and disappeared in a northeasterly
direction. Open was estimated at between 40 - 50 miles per hour. The observer
states one light appeared to be of spotlight type pointed toward ground and was
sufficient to illuminate dash of auto. Total time observed was approximately
20 minutes. Then was no evidence of any type of propulsion nor was there any
sound. One observer states a trail was left when objects were in motion. Trail
was estimated at approximately 10,000 feet. Objects were observed
from within auto windows at stopped distance across.

The significance of the reports as received cannot be determined by this.

We were going along the upper Bellbrook Road and I noticed what appeared to be two stars close together and I asked her (name redacted) if two stars were like that when we stopped the car. We sat and watched it probably five minutes and it started moving. It was still high in the air, I could estimate eight or ten thousand feet in the air. It moved toward the car and then clearly over it. It had one bright concentrated light, blinking light shining straight down and then a circle of light on the left away from it was curved and a northwest direction. It took about 15 minutes for it to make a complete circle and it disappeared somewhere over Trebein. They turned the lights out of whatever it was and it just went out.

I have never seen anything else of an unusual nature. This thing didn't make any noise. I looked for identification lights or the position lights and green, but I couldn't see anything. The light was so concentrated, directly in one spot like a spotlight. There were two objects, lights on both the same. The way it appeared was similar to two headlights in a car. One was brighter than the other. The other was kind of off at an angle.

Statement of: [redacted], Packing, Dir. Supply and Services, Gentile AF Depot
[location redacted], Ohio

I was driving along the Indian Riffle Road and before we turned off on the Bellbrook Road I saw this object. We turned the corner and went on three or four miles before we stopped. I located 10 something oblong, the back part was green, the front part was the color of a star, real bright. I stopped the car and watched and it got real bright then. It was kind of dim at first and real bright. I just saw one object, sitting still, for about 20 minutes all told. I don't know how long it had been there before I noticed it. When it started to move away it started off real slow and it was a trail kind of veered off in a gradual circle, and just faded away. I suppose it was getting so far away you couldn't see it any more. There was nothing else in the sky but the stars and the moon. It was about three or four miles high. It seemed to move off on the side in a northeasterly direction.

I have never noticed any such objects before.
