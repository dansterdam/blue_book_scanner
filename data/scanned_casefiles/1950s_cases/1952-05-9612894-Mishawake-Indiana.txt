Dear Sirs:

Having read the April 7 issue of "Life" with the article on flying saucers, I thought I would write in my own experience.

What I saw seems to be different from anything mentioned in "Life", so if there is a natural explanation I would appreciate your telling me so that I would make no more mistakes.

My "saucer" was red, a dull, intense red. I saw it about 9:13 in the evening. I regret to say I don't remember the day.

The shape of the object was rather like this [handdrawn shape]. It was not an airplane light or something like that. It remained in one place for about a half a minute and then suddenly went up a little and into a cloud bank. It made no noise that I could hear, but it was quite far away. I am no mathematician so I can not say anything as to the height or the speed of the object. If this is any use to you I will draw a picture of what I saw.

[handdrawn sketch]

The object went south west up.
the line represents the angle which the object made on its rise.

Please tell me if this is any use. This is an entirely true story.

Sincerely,
[signature redacted]

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT    UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: (Long)
Hq 1703th Defense Wing
O'Hare International Airport

REPORT NO.
4706DW-1-52

PAGE    1    OF    2    PAGES

The following report is submitted in compliance with ADCL 200-1, dtd 11 Apr 51, as amended by ADC MISSION INTELLIGENCE, Issue No. 3, dtd 16 Apr 52.

1. Description of object sighted.

a. Definition. (The shape of the object was described as oval (see Inclosure #1). Characteristics of outline) was described as slightly hazy, this being attributed to the fact that the object was apparently a great distance away.

b. Size. The object was described as being slightly less than one-half the size of the moon.

c. Color. Described by the observer as being a dull, intense red.

d. Number. One (1).

e. Formation. Not applicable.

f. Aerodynamic features. Undetermined.

g. Trail or exhaust. There was no trail or exhaust observed, either while the object was stationary or in motion.

h. Propulsion system. Undetermined.

i. Sound. None.

j. Maneuvers. The object was in sight for a total of approximately thirty (30) seconds, twenty-eight (28) of which the object was stationary. Then in approximately two (2) seconds time, the object was observed to describe an arc in the horizontal plane of about 20 degrees to the right and about 20 degrees in the vertical plane. (See Inclosure #2).

k. Manner of disappearance. The object disappeared into a cloud. This observation is unusual because although the object was described as being a dull, intense red color, the clouds were described by the weather observer at Bendix Field as being thin to the point that stars could be vaguely discerned.

COMMENT: The object could have been high enough above the clouds to catch sun rays giving red color.

1. Other pertinent information. From the various angular bearings made at the scene, the following data is submitted as an intelligent estimate, assuming that the disappearance of the object was at an altitude of 25,000 feet.

Speed - 6,120 mph.
Track - 225°.
Distance covered - 4,580 ft.

2. Time. The time of the sighting was 2130 hours on 4 April 1952. Duration of the observation was approximately 30 seconds.

3. Manner of observation. The sighting was visual. The observer was out of doors, and was not wearing glasses.

4. Location of observer - object. The observer was standing near a residence located at 341 East Third Street, Mishawaka, St. Joseph County, Indiana.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: Hq 4706th Defense Wing
O'Hare International Airport

REPORT NO.
L7056DM-1-52

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

the object (based on disappearance at 25,000') is estimated as follows:
Original sighting - 4,840' away (horizontal), at 8,160' altitude.
At disappearance - 9,100' away (horizontal), at 25,000' altitude.

5. Identifying information on observer. The observer is an intelligent, well-informed high school student, who is, although not well versed in aerodynamics nor in meteorology, in the opinion of the interrogating officer, convinced of the authenticity of this phenomena and has been completely honest in her statements.

NAME: [redacted]
AGE: 16 years.
ADDRESS: Mishawaka, Indiana.

6. Weather.
a. The following weather information was obtained from Bendix Field, South Bend, Indiana, which is approximately 8 miles to the northwest of the observer.
- Clouds - Thin broken at 25,000 feet.
- Visibility - 7 miles.
- Temperature - 45 degrees.
- Dew Point - 35
- Wind - Southeast at 15.
- Altimeter setting - 30.14

b. The weather observer on duty at Bendix Field on the night of 8 April 1952 informed the investigating officer that he received two telephone calls on that evening reporting unusual objects (or lights) in the sky. Receiving calls of this nature is unusual. However, when the weather observer looked for the object, he saw what was in his opinion a searchlight reflection on the clouds. The color of this reflection was light silver or white.

COMMENT: The observer of the red object was definite about the fact that the object was sighted in a space where there were no clouds and that it then disappeared into a cloud. A searchlight shining on a cloud would (a) affect the reverse of this, and that it would not clearly show the outline of the clouds. At the time of the sighting there was enough light to distinguish clearly the outline of the clouds.

7. Activities or conditions which might account for the sighting.
a. NONE.

(1) The Dodge Manufacturing Co., which lies on a direct line between the observer and the object sighted, and which has blank premises, ceases operation at its furnaces at 1600 hours daily. There are no other industrial sites on or about the line of sight. There were no flares in the area, and the Police, Newspaper, and radio station received no reports of unusual objects.

8. Existence of any physical evidence. NONE. DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVAL.
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
DOB DIR 520010

9. Interception or identifying action taken. NONE.

10. Local aircraft airborne at the time of sighting. Unknown.
