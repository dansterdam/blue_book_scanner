Dear First,
Having read the April 7 issue of "Life" with the article on flying saucers, I thought I would write in my own experience.
What I saw seems to be different from anything mentioned in "Life", so if there is a natural explanation I would appreciate your telling me so that I would make no more mistakes.
My "saucer" was red, a dull, intense red. I saw it about 9:35 in the evening. I regret to say I don't remember the day.
The shape of the object was rather like this _____________. It was not an aeroplane light or something like that. It remained in one place for about a minute and then suddenly went up a little and into a cloud bank. It made no noise that I could hear, but it was quite far away. I am no mathematician so I can not say anything as to the height or the speed of the object. If this is any use to you I will draw a picture of what I saw.
The object went south west up, the line represents the angle which the object made on its price.
Please tell me if this is any use. This is an entirely true story.

Sincerely,

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from the United States Air Force. 

Transcribed text from the document:

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES 

16 LTJGO61I, Defense wing 
Ito lnternat1onal Airport
the object (based on disappearance at 25,000') is estimated as follows:

Original sighting - 4,610' away (horizontal), at 5,100' altitude. 
At disappearance - 9,100' away (horizontal), at 25,000' altitude.

Identifying information on observer. The observer is an intelligent, well-informed high school student, aged 16, who is, although not well-versed in aerodynamics nor in meteorological phenomena, an observer of the sky and has been previously interested in the question of "flying saucers" and the authenticity of their existence.

NAME: -----
AGE: 16 years
ADDRESS: Mishawaka, Indiana.

Weather: 
The following weather information was obtained from Bendix Field, South Bend, Indiana, which is approximately 5 miles to the northwest of the observer.

Ceiling: 5,000 feet 
Visibility: 7 miles
Temperature: -15 degrees. 
Dew Point: 22° at 15.
Winds - 22.1h.

The weather observer on duty at Bendix Field on the night of 9 April 1952 reported unusual objects (or objects) in the sky. Receiving calls on this nature, he gave his opinion a somewhat light reflection on the clouds. The color of this reflection was white.

COMMENT: The observer of the red object was definite about the fact that the object was rapidly moving and gaining altitude. The shining on a cloud would give the effect of the reverse of this. Also the outline of the object was clearly the outline of the clouds. For this reason I am skeptical about the authenticity of this sighting.
