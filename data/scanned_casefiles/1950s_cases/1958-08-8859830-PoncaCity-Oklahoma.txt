Flying Object, 13 Aug 58

This officer feels that in view of the insufficient information, a good or factual analysis of a possible cause relative to this sighting cannot now be made. However, he is quite sure that the Observer saw something, giving an honest account of what was seen, and that this sighting constitutes a valid Unidentified Flying Object.

1. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs - None.

1. The following information concerning an unidentified flying
object in this filter area is submitted in accordance with
instructions contained in AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 1958:

    a. Description of the Object:

        (1) Shape - Round.

        (2) Size - Compared to a known object - One tenth the size
        of a dime, held in the hand at about arm's length. The observer also
        compared the object's size to a ball shot from a large "roman candle."

        (3) Color - Bright, fiery orange.

        (4) Number - One (1).

        (5) Formation - Not applicable.

        (6) Any discernible features or details - The observer said
        the object looked like a ball of fire, or bright, fiery light, orange in
        color and was travelling at a high rate of speed. He commented that the
        object appeared to be far in the distant east, maybe 50 miles away. The
        observer further stated that he did not know if the object might be a
        satellite, a nose-cone from a missile or what. He did not believe it was
        a meteor since he did not think meteors acted in the manner of the object
        he observed. However, he admitted never having actually seen a meteor nor
        did he have any technical or theoretical background in astronomy or
        meteorology.

        (7) Tail, Trail or Exhaust - The observer stated the object
        appeared to have a tail to it and, assuming it was 4 inch in diameter,
        the tail would be one (1) inch in length.

        (8) Sound - None.

    b. Description of Course of Object:

        (1) What first called the attention of the observer - The
        observer had just closed his garage door, facing east, turned to the
        left and then noticed the fiery, bright object in the Northeast traveling at terrific speed.
