CONFIDENTIAL 
SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
PREPARING OFFICE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:
The following report was received at 2010 hours, 23 February 56, by the First Army Staff Duty Officer - an individual identifying himself as S/Sgt GEORGE PIERCE, further identifying data unknown, but believed to be a member of the U.S. Army who was walking near his mother's residence in Brooklyn, NY at approximately 2000 hours, 23 Feb 56. S/Sgt PIERCE was at the time.
Up to the time the direction of airborne object led the individual to the conclusion it was not a known aircraft, the details of its maneuvers were not recorded. Information available indicates the object was moving in the direction of lower New York Bay, and that the individual sighted was not sure he could identify the object accurately as an aircraft. No other witnesses reported. 
The details as described by S/Sgt PIERCE were that the object appeared to be wobbling or fluttering in the air, and that the source he reflected in the near foot of the object gave him the impression it was a sphere or globe-shaped. He stated the object appeared to be much larger than a conventional aircraft.
