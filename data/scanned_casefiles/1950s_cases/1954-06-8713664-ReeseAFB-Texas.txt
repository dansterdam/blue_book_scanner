Dr. W. Perry Wilkins, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and a top notch authority, deceased - 1961)
Incident: June 11, 1954 - Dr. Wilkins was a passenger on a plane flying between Charleston, W. Va & Atlanta, GA. They were flying at 8,000' when he saw two brilliant, oval-shaped objects hovering over two lofty cloud masses. He described them as charged with a cone of burnished gold, at a distance estimated at 2 miles. A third UFO was seen in the shade of the cloud, and its color was gray.

The two UFOs started moving against the wind, and following in a wide arc. All three vanished into the thick cloud.
Duration: 2 minutes. - Dr. Wilkins.
