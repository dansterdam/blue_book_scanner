256                SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR October 26, 1957

ASTRONOMY

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is
a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the
Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

> THAT BRILLIANT object you see in
the southwestern sky these evening as darkness falls is not an airplane, a flying saucer, or a celestial visitor, but the planet Venus
in an experiment.

What you see is the planet Venus, now
reaching its greatest prominence, which
comes just before its disappearance from
the evening sky.

Venus is far brighter than any other star
or planet now in the night sky and there
is no difficulty in identifying it. Indeed, it
can be observed long before the sky is dark,
even as early as 4:30 p.m., and if you can
even see it is broad daylight!

After it passed behind the sun last April
14, Venus has gradually been drawing to
the east of the sun, rising earlier in the
sky, and so remained visible in the west
after the sun had set. On Nov. 18 it will
be farther east of the sun, hence remaining
in the sky for the longest time after sunset.
This will be the time of its greatest brilliance
moving toward the sun again.

Because of its early setting, Venus does
not appear on the accompanying maps of
the November evening skies, which show
the planet's position at a somewhat later
kind of standard time, at the first of November, 7:00 p.m. on the 15th and 8:00 p.m. on
the 20th.

Brightly Blaze in the Sky

These maps do, however, show the stars
that are now visible.

Toward the west is Deneb, at the top
of the "northern cross," which is really part
of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan.
To the right of Deneb and lower down is
Altair and means "sail." The crosspiece
represents the wing, and the lower part of
the cross his long neck, stretched forward
in flight. At the end is Albireo, a star of
beautiful color. Below Cygnus is another
bright summer star, Vega, in Lyra; the first
to the left is another bird, Aquila, the
eagle.

High in the south, you can see the four
stars that form the "great square" part of
the constellation Pegasus. To the west
before. Although these are not among the
brightest, their characteristic arrangement
makes them a good starting place from
which to find other groups. The bright
stars of Pegasus are now standing in the
lower right corner of the square in has head.
The star at the upper right, Alpheratz, is

will in the coming month. Then you will
see them high in the south.

Fortunately the bull, the bull with
brilliant Aldebaran, and to the left of this
figure stands Auriga, the charioteer, with
first magnitude Capella.

Although only Venus must now visible in
the evening sky, Mars will be seen in the
southeast before sunrise. Brightest of the
planets is Jupiter, in the constellation of Virgo, the
virgin. It is close to the bright star Spica.
However, it exceeds the star in brilliance
and is much brighter.

Farther east is Mars, rising about an hour
ahead of the sun. Its brightness is about
half that of Spica. Mercury and Saturn
are both too near the sun to be easily visible
in November.

Shower of "Stars" to Come

November is the month bringing one of
the year's famous showers of meteors, or
"shooting stars," which appear from about
the 13th to the 16th.

They are most numerous after midnight,
because then we are on the forward side of
the earth in its annual movement around
the sun. Thus, we meet then head-on.
This is different from the evening hours
when we are on the rearward part, and see
only those that catch up to us.

A Flying Saucer the Size of a Tractor-Wheel in Alagoas
(Diario de Noticias, Porto Alegre, Dec 5, 1957)

Maceio [text] h. (Meridional) - letter received from the town
of Capele reports that a flying saucer was seen flying over the Triunfo
Estate (by Jo√£o Cabral Almada and the Pedrinhas Estate (by h.

the first appearance of the strange object occurred at 19 o'clock
on the 25th, the second one at 4 AM on the 27th.

Flavio Amorim states that the luminous object remained in view for
30 minutes and then disappeared slowly.

The device seen at a low altitude, was described as having the
shape of a ball, as being orange-colored and the size of a tractor-wheel
1.25 m in diameter.

Saw Sputnik,
Woman Says

Mrs. Helen Murphy of 115
Hickory st. reported today
that she saw what she thinks
was Sputnik I's rocket passing
overhead last night.

"It was close to ten after
six ... It was just like a bright
star ... I knew it wasn't an
airplane. It moved from north
to south and finally faded. I
saw it and ran into the house
to get my husband. We went
from the front yard and
ran around to the back yard to
watch some more. I guess we
could see it for a couple of
minutes, something like that. It
looked just like the star and
it was moving. I thought it
would be more faster than it
was, that it would whiz by
and be gone."

Meanwhile, Kenneth E. Ki-
sell of Fairborn, chairman of
the Moonwatch team here, re-
ported the he received 100
calls last night from people who
thought they saw the rocket.
"We saw nothing that we
could put any faith in," Kissell
reported today.

He said his Moonwatch team
would be looking again tonight
from 5:15 to 7:15 p.m.

SINGULAR "UFO" CAPTURED BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES: Well, what do you know? Something very strange has happened in Leme, State of Sao Paulo, on November 29th and one is almost safe to say another piece of material evidence has been secured to prove that unidentified flying objects do exist and that they are solid objects.

So far we only know about the strange Leme event from newspapers, but GPDV has already written to all concerned, trying to get someone details. To be exact the Leme object, should be termed as a "UFO", meaning unidentified falling object, because it was not really flying, but slowly falling from the sky when it was first spotted. Let us quote from "Folha da Manha" of Sao Paulo, today's issue - December 1st, 1957.

"A strange object 30 centimeters in diameter (one foot) fell from the sky on November 29 at 17:20 local time (20:20 GMT) on a farm near Leme. It is a dark matter and looks like very fine 'steel straw', bearing signs of having been exposed to high combustion. One of the witnesses, Mr Sebastiao Martinati said: 'My son Jose pointed out to me, very high in the sky, a black wheel slowly falling and apparently rotating. At the beginning it could be said to be a buzzard circling overhead. All of us (three people) watched eagerly as it struck the ground inside an orchard. We were rather scared and I did not allow any of the presents to touch the weird contraption. After landing the thing seemed to shrink a little bit.'"

A "Folha da Manha" reporter went to the scene and later stated that nobody was able to identify the strange thing. The best bet being that the object was the product of combustion of some mineral exposed to very high temperature. In fact the reporter tried to set it afire but the object only became red-hot and resisted. Despite the "Martian hair" (Thank Heavens! Editor), some people suggested that the thing could be the sample of fuel used by flying discs (our skies are lousy with them now. Ed.), while others suggested that it was a burnt coil fallen from the first Sputnik rocket due to fall at any time now.

Mr Gabriel Franco Silveira, technician of the Rio Claro power plant examined the filaments with a magnifying glass and concluded that the "wires" are attached to a central dense nucleus, because he detected what seemed to be minute particles of solder. (Does solder sound familiar? Ed.) Mr Cleto Marinho, Delegate of Police, has already taken steps to have the fallen material properly analyzed, GPDV is doing its best to get a sample, a photo, as well the result of the analysis and if the thing proves to be of any value, a special air-delivered bulletin will be sent to all subscribers.

POST SCRIPT TO THE CAPTURED UFO ENTRY:

The strange thing fallen from the sky in Leme, Brazil, mentioned on page 5 is now being examined by Instituto de Pesquisa Tecnologicas (Institute of Technological Researches) in Sao Paulo. A preliminary analysis for radioactivity has been made by means of a Geiger-Muller counter with negative results. Therefore, according to the technicians, two possibilities are already excluded: 1) that it was an object from the high layers of the atmosphere, because if it had, some of the natural radioactivity would be present in its relatively approach amounts. 2) that the object is a "tremendous or combination of a rocket propelled by any fissionable or nuclear process, because if it were, the results of several tests the "thing" is being submitted to, will be known within a fortnight, it can't tell readily what the thing is?

UFO CAPTURED BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES. RESULT OF ANALYSIS:

The Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnol√≥gicas of S√£o Paulo has completed the analysis of the object fallen in Leme last November. (See "The Flying Saucer" No.9 pages 5 & 6).

The analysis was made by the chemist Paul Phillip, who wrote the following statement:

"The sample presents a cluster of black filaments. Submitted to calcination the material decreases 60% in weight. The chemical analysis revealed 40% carbon and a mineral residuum of the same sort, essentially constituted by 65% silicon dioxide. Then the carbonic matter was eliminated by calcination the filamentous form was not destroyed. These analysis and some complementary others allow to conclude that the filaments are constituted by fiberglass coated by some carbonic matter originated by incomplete combustion of an organic substance.

This form of carbonic matter is frequently found when different organic substances are submitted to incomplete combustion. Therefore nothing can be said about the nature of the organic material that originated it."
