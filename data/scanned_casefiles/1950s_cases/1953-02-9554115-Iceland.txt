Flying Object Report (Restricted)

Iceland

25 February 1953 See Text

Milton Zadovsky, Capt., USAF Icelandic Newspaper P-ro-85

1. Copies of this report will be furnished the Commanding General, IDA,
and Air Attache, England.

2. At about 2100Z, 16 February 1953, a bright light was observed by three
men at Eyrarbakki (63°-52'N, 16°-10'W). The light was low and traveling south-
east. It's color stayed steady but faded and brightened several times and was observed
for about 30 minutes.

3. There was no bad indication in the article as to altitude, speed or color
of the light.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER

4. Quite often there have been reports of flying saucers included in the
local newspapers which arrived at this section long after they were observed,
which is the main reason for their not having been reported. However, this
section now has the services of a full-time translator and these reports will
be available to us within a short period after the incidents occur and will
be reported.
