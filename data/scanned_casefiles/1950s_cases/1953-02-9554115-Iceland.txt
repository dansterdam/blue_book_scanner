1. Copies of this report will be furnished the Commanding General, IDE,
and Air Attaché, England.

2. At about 2000Z, 16 February 1953, a bright light was observed by three
men at Keflaviknäs (Goðafjós [sic]), Iceland. The 14 min was low and traveling south-
east. It was not steady but faded and brightened several times and was observed
for about 10 minutes.

3. There was no indication in the article as to altitude, speed or color
of the light.

COMMENTS of the PREPARING OFFICER

4. Quite often there have been reports of flying saucers included in the
local newspapers which arrived at this section long after they were observed,
which is the main reason for their not having been reported. However, this
section now has the service of a full-time translator and these reports will
be available to us within a short period after the incidents occur and will
be reported.
