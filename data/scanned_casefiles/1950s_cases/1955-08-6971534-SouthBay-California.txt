UFOS INDEX CARD

1. DATE: 9 August 1955

2. LOCATION: South Bay, California

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2135 PST, 9 Aug 1955
Local GMT

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual (checked)

5. PHOTOS: No

6. SOURCE: Civilian (12 yrs old)

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Thirty-nine (39) Seconds

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One (1)

9. COURSE: W to E

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
One (1) disc shaped object, the size of a grapefruit held at arm's length, was silver in color and sounded like a jet. The object flew a straight course to the east. The noise attracted the observer's attention.

11. COMMENTS:
The age of the observer would limit the observer's knowledge of objects which would be readily identifiable to the trained layman. In all probability the source saw a conventional aircraft (Probably Jet) which reflecting the sunlight, gave the disc-shaped appearance. The fact that the object sounded like a jet and the noise of the object first attracted the observer's attention, leads to the above checked conclusion.
