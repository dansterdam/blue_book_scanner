Glowing Spheres Seen Over Almansa, Spain -- Tangier, Espana, 22 Apr 52

Almansa, 21 April -- At 0800 hours today, many persons saw a series of four glowing spheres crossing the sky along the Murcia-Valencia trajectory at high speed and at a great height. The spheres looked like locks of wool of a vivid reddish color which changed to an intense yellow as they flew farther away. They gradually disappeared in the distance. No unusual sound was heard. The spectacle lasted hardly a minute.
