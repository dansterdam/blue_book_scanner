FIVE MILES NORTHWEST TO NORTH OF BALTIMORE PD THE EXISTING VISIBILITY AT THE TIME WAS POOR DUE TO A HAZE LAYER AND A SLIGHT MIST THOUGH OUT THE AREA THERE ARE THREE /3/ AIR WARS IN THIS AREA / TED 29- RED 33 RED 45 / AND TRAFFIC IS FAIRLY HEAVY ON ALL OF THEM PD IT IS MY OPTION THAT THE SIGHTINGS WERE ACTUALLY PASSING AND NAVIGATIONAL LIGHTS OF NORMAL ROUTINE AIRWAYS TRAFFIC AND BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED VISIBILITY WERE NOT READILY IDENTIFIED AS SUCH BY THE OBSERVER. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS DEEMED NECESSARY WASHINGTON CAA ADVISE THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO CORRELATE AIRWAYS TRAFFIC / RED 29- RED 33 - RED 45 / FOR THE EXACT TIMES THE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED.

Gentlemen:

On January 12th, 1954 at about 1:00 
Am, a strip of startling, brilliant 
green unfolded from sky to my right to 
west else left into three bursts (as unfurled a certain distance, stiffed more 
hardly, continued in arc, stopped 
in harder manifestation instant, then 
moved. burst in the same interrupted 
arc - as else soft of which appeared this affirmatively, roughly where 
ing white-yellow disk like the musical 
cab type you can buy at Read's drug 
store. Nowhere. As to circumference, 
a minor strip of red was seen. From 
this a joining object, size of a hand-
beam, on either side of the green-yellow 
red and orange fire in broad streams 
who shed an explosive few suddenly the 
dim of tipped over; there was a sudden 
effect like an explosion. It bore the

Even though it seemed to dip about 3 yds.
at times. Then went on for approximately
25 min. I had a daughter takes a look
at the sky then, not being her what
it was. I wanted her to see. She also
saw this moving object, just as I saw
it.

About 3:50 Ams., where we had be-
fore noticed a certain star(?) because
and away like a pendulum, in the
Eastern sky, then comes, I guess, a
some tiny, its moved forward, changed
from white to orange to red, then settled
and reappeared. A tiny, few points of
red seemed to follow it. In sky, at the left
of it and very close to it. Each time the
stars and that part of the sky were blot-
ted out, with the disappearance of these
objects. At the time of the white char-
in the Western sky, there were other
stars around it, that when it disap-
peared, there was nothing, except that
on the Western horizon, there was a

Here is the OCR text from the document:

the round object had been a
black void. All around that were
somewhat lazily floating white puffy
of smoke. That nothing to all looks
about as half minute or so. It was
warm and still outside. A slow easy
pre-dawn midsummer morning but
not the bright as the ground I disa-
tention here this phenomenon (?) disap-
peared. An hour and a half later, the
temp... ture outside was 63°.

Lc..., at about 3:00 pm or so, in the
eastern sky, there was this round,
white, blurred, size of a large hand,
object which dipped up and down, side
to side, slowly, moving constantly, but
always coming back to same spot.

Here is the text from the document:

may consider me 'crazy' as to speak, and
who knows, maybe they would be right.

Yet, sometimes, change does things
are not quite to our surprise, as we'd
begin occasionally to see close things
almost two seemingly ago, then this seems
and plain fells, and weird, I have this time
my single try, brought to my attention by
two children, nine and almost thirteen. In
varying, they quite down the blindness
see it, and virtually go to sleep, now if
it's likely, as they shall forget about they
become they feels somewhat uneasy. I
don't. Still here go outside, to get a better
view. Only sometimes, you'd think that I
was the one upon whom a camera was be-
ing trained, and was being persecuted,
and not the other way around.

So, I have decided to put this all
in writing, forget about it, and don't to
worry whether there are any more go-igo

Here is the OCR text from the document:

similar glow of light, like right be-
fore the color of the sunrise appear,
and everything is silhouetted against it.

Too bad, someone can't come out here
and watch, and see, especially close
shimmering, color changing, totally
swinging sometimes bounding, dipping
and fading what-not that we see
at times. I wish someone could tell me
that they were what I saw, or tell me what
I saw a victim of hallucinations; be-
cause only such activity in the sky is
usually from 1:00 and to 4:00 hrs. - though
sometimes they begin earlier.

This past week, in the southwest
again, I saw a color changing star;
it seemed to come lower to catch then
before. Once there was a muted glow
like a sunburst right below it, which
for an instant lit up the dark area and
fleeting, disappeared.

I hate to write about this, about people.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Top of page (partially legible):
"So clear this point what's..."
(Rest of top text is illegible)

Bottom left:
"63° 20' 30"N

Bottom right:
"1:00 Own.

The document appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram with curved lines and some annotations, but much of the text is difficult to fully decipher due to the image quality.
