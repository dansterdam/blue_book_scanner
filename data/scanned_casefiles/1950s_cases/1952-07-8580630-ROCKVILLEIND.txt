TO: Director of Special Investigations, Washington 25, D. C.

On 22 July 1952, at 2130 hours, 22 July 1952, radar operators at a radar site near Springfield, Massachusetts, observed a number of objects which appeared on their radar screens. These objects were observed and identified to be at the site for approximately 40 minutes.

DETAILS:
1. On 22 July 1952, the Public Information Officer, wherever he is, received a call from the local police in Springfield, Mass., who reported the sighting of an unusual airborne object during the evening of 22 July 1952.

2. On 24 July 1952, the Public Information Officer furnished the following information to Special Agent Richard D. SMITH:
The objects sighted on radar were described as very large, the largest of which appeared to be about the size of the moon. They appeared to be traveling at an extremely high speed and were observed to make very sharp turns. They were tracked on radar for approximately 40 minutes. Visual sightings by personnel on the ground were also made and they reported that the objects had a bluish-white color with no discernible features. The objects could not be identified and were described as traveling in an erratic manner, sometimes hovering and sometimes moving at a high speed. The size of the objects varied, the largest being about the size of the moon.
