At 2130 hours, 22 July 1952, Mrs. [redacted], Springfield, Mass., observed a pale orange, round object, slowly moving up and down while moving in a southerly direction. Firework displays not off at 2230 hours at Mountain Park, Holyoke, Mass. could possibly account for sighting.

2. On 24 July 1952, [redacted] furnished the following information to Special Agent RANKIN D. WILSON:

    a. The object appeared to be round, half as large as the moon appears, a very pale orange color, with no aerodynamic features observed. Speed of object was very slow and no sound was heard. The object was first observed about 100 above the horizon, and was slowly moving in a southerly direction while slowly moving up and down about one-half (1/2) its own diameter, as the object moved in a southerly direction.
