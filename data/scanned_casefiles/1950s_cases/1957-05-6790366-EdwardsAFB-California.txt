d. Edwards AFB (Case 2) (May 1957)

This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was observed over the so-called "United States secret test grounds", and had been photographed officially by high-speed cameras, specially designed to track aircraft and missiles, by AF personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crews, who, took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. They later described it as a disc shaped to interrogators, after they brought the matter to the attention of Wright. A study of 32 photographs taken, and highly magnified disclosed the object to the size of a match head, but changing shape from round to elliptical, as the early sun's rays played upon its surface. A wind plot, correlated with the reported speed and movements of the object, practically coincided. This pointed to the object being a balloon. Further investigations not only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements coincided with the observer's report as to times, elevations and bearings.

This case is considered as having been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of ATIC until well after the press had received it; the Edwards AFB PIO officer made statements to the press that it was "unknown", when investigations disclose that he was informed it was a balloon, and the local commander could have solved the case by making local inquiries of his various units.

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards Air Force Base UFO Sightings - 2 May 57

TO:   Directorate of Intelligence
       Headquarters, USAF
       ATTN: AFOIN-XL
              (Mr. Sanderson)

1. General: This analysis is based on a careful review and study of all
facts and pertinent information submitted on this case. The analysis is in
three basic parts:

a. Study of the observer's UFO questionnaire, the official UFO report
from Edwards AFB, airborne objects known to have been in the area at the
time, geographical factors, and the elements of time, elevations, bearings
and meteorological conditions pertinent to the sightings.

b. Analysis of theodolite photographs submitted, with correlation to
the known facts.

c. Evaluation of the sources (observers).

2. Analysis of UFO Report and Questionnaire Data:

a. UFO report, photographs, and questionnaire as accomplished by the
observers was not received by this Center until 23 May 1957, (see inclosure
#1, #2, and #3) and considerably after the incident had reached both the
press and the public.

b. Reference page 3, item (11)(a) of UFO report. The attempted analysis
of this sighting by the official preparing the report to the effect the object
could not have been a balloon is not valid. In fact, the data supplied
throughout the report (exact geographical locations of balloon site, observers'
positions, metro data, precise computations as to angles or elevation, bearings and altitude, among others) indicate that it is highly improbable that
the object was other than a balloon.

c. A comparative analysis of the data from the UFO questionnaire and
the data derived from scientific instruments and actual official time-tracks
of the balloon launched indicate the following:

(1) Testimony given by both observers is that the time of their
sighting was between 0755 and 0820 (see attached copy of UFO
Questionnaire, Form 164).

(2) A rawindsonde balloon was released by the Edward AFB weather
station, west of the observers, at 0740 hours and accurately
tracked until 0840 hours (UFO Report, 14 May 1957).

(3) Observers both estimate the bearing of the object to be
75 degrees when it first appeared, presumably at 0755.


- page 13 -

Here is the text from the document:

(4) Official time-tracking of the balloon (UFO Report, 15 May 57) 
was as follows:

(a) 0750: True Bearing - 70 degrees

(b) 0300: True Bearing - 80 degrees

(c) 0310: True Bearing - 60 degrees

(5) Therefore, interpolating for the first two time-tracks, the 
bearing is exactly 75 degrees. Using an average of all three, 
the results are 70 degrees.

(6) Observers' state that when first observed, their estimated 
angle of elevation of the object was 45 degrees, and 15 degrees 
when it disappeared.

(7) A trigonometrical treatment of the data in the official UFO 
Report (paragraph 1a(11)) indicates that the angle of eleva-
tion during the periods given by the observers was approxi-
mately 30 degrees and 23 degrees respectively.

d. It has been repeatedly proven that without accurate instruments 
devices, a person seldom can estimate angles of elevation against the sky 
within 10 to 20 degrees of the actual elevations, particularly in areas 
other than directly overhead or on the horizon.

e. Therefore, allowing for the known inability of the average person 
to correctly estimate angles and time, the officially computed times, bear-
ings and elevations of the balloon released, almost perfectly coincide with 
the figures given by the observers.

f. Further factual data to support hypothesis that object was balloon:

(1) Reference balloon launching site and Observers' location given 
in UFO report. These two points are approximately 20,000 yards 
apart. It is significant to note that the observers were 
almost due east and slightly south of the balloon launching 
site (see sketch, inclosure #4).

(2) Reference winds aloft in UFO report. The prevailing winds 
at that time were blowing due east.

(3) Reference paragraph 1a(2), azimuths of first sighting. If a 
time-track of the balloon released, due east, is plotted from 
the weather station to and east of observers' location at the 
time given in the UFO report (which states the observers first 
saw the object at due north) the object would have passed 
exactly due north or their location (see sketch, inclosure #4).

-2-


- page 14 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(4) Reference paragraph 1a(11)(a) of UFO Report. Object traveled in easterly direction at all times. It appeared to stand still, change shape and pulsate. These are typical characteristics of balloons, and supported by hundreds of UFO reports found to be balloons.

5. At 1030 hours, 24 May 1957, M/Sgt O. D. Hill, MCOIC, Aerial Phenomena Group, contacted Detachment #21, 4th Weather Group, Edwards AFB, regarding further details on the balloon aspects of the case. In conversations with Major Wininger, the following were disclosed:

(1) The balloon released at 0740 on that date measures approximately 6 to 7 feet at launching, and can expand to 70 to 90 feet at 60,000 feet.

(2) Major Wininger stated that the alleged UFO was obviously this balloon.

(3) Further, Major Wininger stated that this information was given to the Information Services Officer of Edwards AFB. (M/Sgt Hill's report is attached as inclosure #5.)

3. Analysis of Theodolite Photographs of UFO: Based on a study and analysis of the series of Cinetheodolite photographs submitted to the Cetus Center, the following are considered comments pertinent to the incident:

a. In the UFO questionnaire, both observers report that the object was about 150 to 175 feet in diameter. Yet the object on the photographs, after being photographed and the photo enlarged 7 diameters, was scarcely larger than the width of the cross hairs.

b. It is difficult to understand why it was decided to photograph an object that was in sight for almost 30 minutes, after was a mere speck in the sky.

c. Both observers state object 5,000 feet away when first seen, and approximately 60 miles away when last seen. A photo analysis based on the image sizes on the photos, known magnifications, focal lengths of lenses, and other data, using standard optical formulas and equations for distances up to 60 miles show that an object must be a minimum of 92 feet in diameter to be seen even as a speck at a 60 mile distance, assuming ideal atmospheric conditions and the ability of the lens to resolve the image.

d. Using a more realistic distance, 9 to 12 miles, the object would need be a minimum of 5 to 7 feet in diameters. This correlates with the diameter of the balloon actually released. (Analysis of the theodolite photography is attached; see inclosure #6.)

e. It should be noted that practically half of the image sizes are .013 feet at their longest dimension. Plotting a number of points along

-3-


- page 15 -

the .013 line, from 60 down to 6 miles, indicates that the minimum object size discernible, ranges from approximately 80 feet to 6 feet. This correlates well with the data given this Center by the 5th Weather Group at Edwards AFB. See paragraph 2(3) above.

f. A study of 25 consecutive enlargements reveal that the tiny white object alternately changes from elliptical (described as a disc by observers) to round in shape. No clear features are discernible. The changing shapes are generally similar to photographs taken of balloons over desert or bright daylight areas. It should be noted that the sun was due east at this time and not too far above the horizon. The effects of specular reflection of light on rounded surfaces is well known. Weird and unusual appearances can be created.

4. Comments Regarding Sources: Consistent with the principles of commenting on the source in any UFO analysis or conclusions, the following points are considered pertinent:

a. Inconsistencies

(1) In their personal report as given in the UFO questionnaire, both observers state that the object was at a bearing (azimuth) of 75 degrees when first seen, and when it disappeared.

(2) The UFO report from Edwards AFB quotes the observers as saying that they first observed the object due north, (0 degrees azimuth) and that when it disappeared, it was also at due north. All points have been resolved satisfactorily, except the last, in which both observers state (in their questionnaire) that the object disappeared to the east.

(3) In both the official UFO report and their questionnaire, they stated that the object was the size of a basketball held at arms length. A simple demonstration will quickly indicate that a basketball held in front of one's eyes at this distance will cover almost half of the visible sky, and would be an indication that the object would be tremendous in size, if stated, observed at 5,000 feet distance. The object, in actuality, would be almost a 1/2 mile wide.

b. Belief in "Flying Saucers"

(1) One observer has given strong indications that he is a believer in the so-called "flying saucers."

(2) Stated that he observed a "disc" half the size of a football field hanging over a house for twenty minutes. Time

-4-


- page 16 -

and place was Rosemond, California, 0930 P.M. in Januray 50.
Files disclose no report within that general time and area.

(3) No comment is considered necessary regarding an object that
size over a small town for almost one-half hour and not being
seen by any other persons or aircraft, or by radar that scans
that area 24 hours a day.

(4) The observers were specialists in a field of photography. It
should therefore be apparent to them that even a previously
known object would be difficult to estimate as being 60 miles,
much less it appearing as a readily identifiable object on the
prints if it could be photographed at that distance with the
equipment used.

5. Conclusions: Therefore, on the basis of the above, and particularly in
consideration of the factual data presented, singly or collectively, there
is no compelling reason to conclude that the object was other than the bal-
loon released nearly a few minutes prior to the sighting.

6. This Center considers it unfortunate that its knowledge of this incident
was third-hand; it was brought to both the public and press's attention days
before an unofficial UFO organization questioned this Center on the sighting.
Experience has proven that a denial or explanation is never given the same
publicity or attention as the original story. Where denials and explana-
tions are attempted by facts, an attempt, they are often found to be unsatis-
factory.

Denver 8, Colorado
August 20, 1957

Dear Sir:

I am a member of the NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA, and my interest in flying saucers is very great.

About the sighting of a UFO photographed at Edwards Air Force Base May 5 by two showbrite operators at the test center, OFFICIALS AS USUAL have admitted the UFO was tracked by special camera equipment, and that the films were immediately dispatched to Air Technical Intelligence Center in Dayton, Ohio.

Well, to me, the films of the UFO should be sensational. I would like to know what ATIC thinks about the films? If they do show that UFO's exist when will the public be told?

Also I have learned that well-known magazine writer was assigned by a national magazine to do a "whitewash" objective and straightforward reporting piece on the truth about flying saucers from the standpoint of the Air Force. But he was turned down by ATIC at Dayton.

I just can not understand why ATIC turned down the offer to print "the truth about flying saucers?" For once the public could have got a break and learned some "true facts" about the causes. For this new evidence of an official censorship on UFO information is getting to be more fantastic than the UFO's. My "god" when will the American public ever be "told" the tremendous facts concerning the UFO?

Most Sincerely,

AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

The UFO photographed at Edwards Air Force Base in May was a balloon which had been released at a nearby launching site.

The Air Force does not have sufficient personnel to furnish detailed information from thousands of case files to the many persons with interest to write for profit in the subject of UFOs. Any attempt to furnish such details would seriously curtail the essential operations of our intelligence units, and would require an unwarranted expenditure of public funds. You may recall however, that some time ago the Air Force, in the interest of public information, cooperated with the national magazines, Life and Saturday Evening Post, in the preparation of articles on the subject of UFOs.

1. Reference D/I-ATIC conference, 5 March 1957, on the UFO Program, regarding the recommendations made by your office that UFO correspondence of potentially dangerous or controversial nature, publicity wise, should be reviewed by the Directorate, and that it be released over the signature of Headquarters USAF, preferably the Office of Information Services.

2. Accordingly, attached is a suggested reply to subject UFO organization's request for the film and information on the recent Edwards AFB incident. It is interesting to note that the Center did not receive the photos and UFO reports, until more than two weeks after the date of the request.

3. A detailed analysis of this case was just completed, and forwarded to your office. The original film is in repository with the UFO files. Any decision to release the film and detailed data to this organization must come from higher levels. In our opinion, any exception made in favor of one individual or organization will undoubtedly result in a flood of requests from the others. The suggested reply was drafted with this in mind.

14 April 1958

Dear Dr. [redacted]:

Captain Nearley has requested that we answer your letter of 11 March 1958, since some of the information you request is in our area of responsibility.

First, regarding your request for the procedure to procure stock footage from the military service for motion picture films -- footage may be purchased by representatives of recognized motion picture and television agencies, on the basis of scripts submitted to the Department of Defense and approved in advance of film production. Approved scripts are forwarded to the appropriate film depository where the producer may select the purchase such footage as is commensurate with the production of the specific script.

I should caution you again, that good motion picture footage of UFO is not available from any official sources. As was pointed out in earlier correspondence, exhaustive research was conducted by and for the producers of the Armstrong Circle Theatre with no success in finding even a small piece of film that would register on a television screen.

If you will re-read your correspondence, dated 11 June 1957, from Major Robert T. Spence, you will note that there is not any mention of motion picture footage of the Edwards incident. I should also add, since you cited Mr. Ruppelt's book, that it was claimed only for secondary purposes and in fact a disclaimer for factual accuracy was made at that time by the Department of Defense.

Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Captain Marlay:

Thank you for your cordial and informative communication of 28 February. Your continued cooperation - and patience - is appreciated.

Naturally, I shall keep in touch with your office as the script to my pictorial documentary progresses. However, the narrative will gradually develop as the material for the production is successively screened, edited and timed. Therefore, much of script of this post-narrated film will depend precisely on what film is available, including the stock footage to be made available by the Department of Defense.

So you can see that I am in a rather nebulous position at the moment. But I am certain that time will resolve everything. I would wonder if you would be kind enough to tell me just what the purpose of such a book might be.

There is another point that I wish you would clarify. With reference to my inquiry into the availability of four motion pictures of UFO's reportedly in the possession of the Air Force, you responded that you have requested the footage that you have requested has been checked by the Department of the Air Force and there is no record of its existence.

This reply has me a bit mystified. One of the films about which I inquired was allegedly taken by a cine-methodolis crew at Edwards AFB, Calif., on 5 May, 1957, and I have a letter from Major Robert W. Spence, USAF, describing the film in some detail.

As to the gun-camera shot near Wright-Patterson AFB on 20 August, 1952, let me here quote the caption to frame 1 of a December 1952 True Magazine. Hovering object that was scanned by radar and seen by ground watchers was caught on film by a climbing jet pilot. These unretouched frames were released to TRUE by the Air Force.

Dear Captain Marley:

Thank you for your cordial and informative communication of 28 February. Your continued cooperation - and patience - is appreciated.

Naturally, I shall keep in touch with your office as the script to my proposed documentary progresses. However, the narrative will gradually develop as the material for the production is accumulated. Meantime, and until then, much of script of this post-narrated film will depend precisely on what film is available, including the stock footage to be made available by the Department of Defense.

So you can see that I am in a rather nebulous position at the moment. But I am certain that time will resolve everything. I wanted to know if you would be kind enough to tell me just what the purchase of stock footage entails? Thank you.

There is another point that I wish you would clarify. With reference to my inquiry into the availability of four motion pictures of UFO's reportedly in the possession of the Air Force, you responded that, "In specific footage that you have requested has been checked by the Department of the Air Force and there is no record of it elsewhere."

This reply has me a bit mystified. One of the films about which I inquired was allegedly taken by a cine-theodolite crew at Edwards AFB, Calif., on 23 May, 1957, and a later from Major-Robert W. Spence, USAF, describing the film in some detail.

As to the gun-camera shot near Wright-Patterson AFB on 20 August, 1952, let me be more specific. The caption from the movie as reproduced in true Magazine for December 1952 "Hovering object was caught on film by radar and seen by ground watchers was caught on film by a climbing jet pilot. These unretouched 35 mm. cine-camera movie frames, released to LIFE by the Air Force, were taken at 30,000 feet near Wright Field, released 11 Aug., on August 20, 1952. From the appearance of the enlarged frames, the movie was shot on 16mm and not 35mm film.

And the White Sands cine-theodolite films were referred to by Edward J. Russell, Capt., USAF, former chief of Project Blue Book, in his book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (p. 279)... We had or know about four strips of movie film that fell into the "Unknown" category. Two were cine-theodolite movies that had been taken at White Sands Proving Ground in April and May of 1950... Book, Russell's, supposedly cleared by DOD Security and Review on 5 December, 1955.

11 June 1957

Dear Mr. [redacted]

We are in receipt of your letter dated 10 May 1957 requesting photographic prints and a copy of the photo-analysis report on a UFO recently reported over Edwards Air Force Base, California.

We feel certain that you will understand that it will be extremely difficult to make copies of the photo-analysis available to you without making them available to all.

Any attempt to meet the individual demands of the hundreds who may desire specific reports and material would be an almost impossible undertaking; the man hours and cost would be exorbitant; and, most important, the continued interference with the Air Force's normal missions and operations would be unjustified.

Notwithstanding this, reply to your correspondence was withheld pending a complete study of the photographic and other data from investigations, in order that we may give you some general results of our findings. Briefly, please see the following:

a. The alleged UFO was conclusively identified as a balloon released from a weather unit a few miles west of the observer's location.

b. This was corroborated by an independent report which disclosed that this balloon was being tracked at the time with precision recording devices. The data show that the balloon passed the observer's location at almost the precise time, bearings, elevations and speed reported by them.

c. The radar unit for that area reported that there was nothing unusual or unidentified in the air over Edwards Air Force Base at the times in question.

d. Objects in the photographs, even after magnification, were found to be small white specks, alternately changing from elliptical to physical.

to round in shape. These are typical of a number of similar reports received by the Air Force, which upon investigation were found to be balloons, the odd appearances being caused by specular reflection of sunlight, and other intercepted conditions peculiar to desert regions.

It is the opinion of the Air Force that any attempt to attribute anything unusual or mysterious to the incident is unwarranted and not supported by the facts.

TELEPHONE WEBSTER 6-9990

May 10, 1957

Brigadier General Harold E. Watson
Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Dayton, Ohio

Dear General Watson:

On Thursday, May 9, 1957, The Los Angeles Times reported the following:

"AIR FORCE STUDIES PHOTOS --- Cameras Track Flying Object Over Desert ---"

"Camera Studies of an unidentified flying object photographed at Edwards Air Force Base last Friday are being analyzed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, O. The Times learned yesterday."

"Spokesmen at the secret desert test center north of Los Angeles would say only that the object was spotted by two civilian photo theodolite operators."

"They tracked the object and took pictures with the specialized camera equipment. Film and information were dispatched immediately to the intelligence center."

"Unofficial reports said the object appeared round, that it caught the morning sun and that it moved but not, at any great speed. There were no estimates as to its size or altitude."

"Edwards officers would not hazard a guess as to what the object was, although one said it could have been a weather balloon."

"This desert air does crazy things," he said.

A request is hereby made for prints from the negative film shot of the UFO. If this is prohibited by costs, I will compensate the Air Force for the expense involved for such duplication. If the ATIC wishes to retain the film, I will be happy to observe it on a short-loan basis, or through the local USAF OPL.

Also, the writer hereby requests a copy of the photo-analysis made - or to be made - by ATIC of this film. I feel that such cooperation between the Air Force and a civilian-may initiate better public relations and create or enhance the public's understanding of UFO research.

"I will shew wonders in the heavens..." — Joel 2:30

4. Edwards AFB Case (9 May 1957)

This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was observed over the so-called "United States secret testing grounds", and had been photographed officially by high-speed cameras, specially designed to track aircraft and missiles, by AF personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crews, who took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. They later described it as a disc shaped to interrogators, after they brought the matter to the attention of higher authorities. A study of 32 photographs taken, and highly magnified disclosed the object to the size of a match head, but changing shape from round to elliptical, as the early sun's rays played upon its surface. A wind gat, correlated with the reported speed and movements of the object, practically concluded. This pointed to the object being a balloon. Further investigations not only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements coincided with the observer's report as to times, elevations and bearings.

This case is considered as having been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of AFIG until well after the press had received it; the Edwards AFB PIO officer made statements to the press that it was "unknown", when investigations disclose that he was informed it was a balloon; and the local commander could have solved the case by making local inquiries of his various units.

EDWARDS AFB PHOTOGRAPHS UFO

May 3, 1957: An unidentified object was spotted by two civilian photo-theodolite operators at Edwards Air Force Base in California. They tracked the object and took pictures with the "specialized camera equipment." Results were dispatched immediately to Wright-Patterson AFB at Dayton, Ohio. Unofficial reports said the object appeared round, that it caught the morning sun, and that its speed was not great. There were no estimates as to its size or altitude. Edwards officers would not hazard a guess as to what the object was, although one said it could have been a weather balloon. "This desert air does crazy things," he added. — L. A. Times, 5/9, N. Y.

Reply - Letter from "Flying Saucers - International" on Edwards AFB Incident

4 June 1957

AFOIN-42h/(Capt G.T. Gregory)/69216

1. Reference D/I-ATIC conference, 5 March 1957, on the UFO Program, regarding the recommendations made by your office that UFO correspondence of potentially dangerous or controversial nature, publicity wise, should be reviewed by the ACOIN-Agency, and that it be released over the signature of Headquarters USAF, preferably the Office of Information Services.

2. Accordingly, attached is a suggested reply to subject UFO organization's request regarding the film and information on the recent Edwards AFB incident. It is suggested to note that the Center did not receive the photos and UFO reports, then one week after the date of the request.

3. A detailed analysis of this case was just completed, and forwarded to your office. The original film is in repository with the UFO files. Any decision to release the film and detailed data to this organization must come from higher levels.

4. In our opinion, any exception made in favor of one individual or organization will undoubtedly result in a flood of requests from the others. The suggested reply was drafted with this in mind.

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards AF Base UFO Sighting - 2 May 57

length. A simple demonstration will quickly indicate that a basketball held in front of one's eyes at this distance will cover almost half of the visible sky, and would be an indication that the object would be tremendous in size, if as stated, observed at 5,000 feet distance. The object, in actuality, would be almost 1/2 mile wide.

b. Belief in "Flying Saucers"

(1) One observer has given strong indications that he is a believer in the so-called "flying saucers."

(2) Stated that he observed a "disc" almost half the size of a football field hanging over a house for twenty minutes. This and place was Rosamond, California, 0930 p.m. in January '50. This discloses no report with thin that general area.

(3) No comment is considered necessary regarding an object that size over a small town for almost one-half hour and not being seen by any other persons or aircraft, or by radar that scans that area 24 hours a day.

(4) The observers were specialists in a field of photography. It should therefore be apparent to them that even a previously known object would be difficult to estimate as being 60 miles, much less it appearing as a readily identifiable object on the prints if it could be photographed at that distance with the equipment used.

5. Conclusions: Therefore, on the basis of the above, and particularly in consideration of the factual data presented, singly or collectively, there is no compelling reason to conclude that this object was other than the balloon released only a few minutes prior to this sighting.

6. This Center considers it unfortunate that its knowledge of this incident was third-hand; it was brought to both the public and press's attention days before an unofficial UFO organization queried this Center on the sighting. Experience has proved that a denial or explanation is never given the same publicity or attention as the original story.

DATE 2 May 1957

We were traveling south in a pickup truck to Adelanto Camera Station #4. At 0755 hours 2 May 1957 we turned east and [redacted] called the object to my attention. It was hanging stationary almost overhead. I stopped the vehicle and got out to look at it, and when we headed for the camera station. By the time we got the camera uncovered, looked and ready, it was almost due east from us at about 1500'. It was about/150 feet in diameter and had a translucent glow, very bright. After shooting some film manner, we tracked its further movement. It was some more film of it. It was estimated to be 40 to 50 miles away when film was taken, and about 60 miles when it disappeared.

We left the master station heading south for one mile then turned east for
Atlanta station #4. After heading east for 100 yards I looked thru the windshield
and saw the object at about 1500 feet up in the air, just hanging there. The driver
and myself continued to the Atlanta station and removed and loaded the camera.
From the time first seen till camera was loaded 10 minutes had past. We started tak-
ing pictures of the object with the camera normally. We took approximately 40 frames.
We saw the object for approximately 25 to 30 minutes before it went out of sight.

Edwards AFB Case (2 May 1957)

This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was over so-called "United States secret testing grounds", and had been photographed officially by high-speed cameras, especially designed to track aircraft and missiles by AF personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crews, who took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. The sighting was apparently released to the press, directly or otherwise, prior to official AF investigation. A study of 32 photographs taken and highly magnified, disclosed the object to be the size of a match head, but changing shape from round to elliptical, as the early sun's rays played upon its surface. A wind plot, correlated with the reported speed and movements of the object, practically coincided. This pointed to the object being a balloons. Further investigations only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements coincided with the observer's reports as to times, elevations and bearings.

This case is considered to have been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of ATIC until well after the press had received it; the Edwards AFB official made statements to the press that it was "unknown" when investigations disclosed that they had been informed that it was a balloon; and the local commander could have solved the case by making local inquiries of his various units.

d. Edwards AFB Case (2 May 1957)

This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was observed over the so-called "United States secret testing grounds", and had been photographed officially by high-speed cameras, specially designed to track aircraft and missiles, by AF personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crews, who took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. They later described it as else mapped to interrogators, after they brought the matter to the attention of others. A study 32 photographs taken, and highly magnified disclosed the object to the size of a match head, but changing shape from round to elliptical, as the early sun's rays played upon its surface. A wind jet, correlated with the reported speed and movements of the object, practically concluded. This pointed to the object being a balloon. Further investigations not only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements coincided with the observer's report as to times, elevations and bearings.

This case is considered as having been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of ATIC until well after the press had received it; the Edwards AFB FIO officer made statements to the press that it was "unknown", when investigations disclose that he was informed it was a balloon; and the local commander could have solved the case by making local inquiries of his various units.

BALLOON CHECK ON EDWARDS AFB CASE

As per telephone conversation with Major Wilinger, Detachment 21, 4th Weather Group, Edwards AFB, California.

Major Wilinger is aware of the facts of this case and he stated, (quote) "On the morning of 2 May 1957, 7:40 ZDT they released a Ravisonde balloon which at release measures 300 some or 5 to 6 feet, in diameter, which reaches a diameter of 75 to 90 ft. at 60,000 ft. altitude." Major Wilinger also stated that this sighting is quite obviously the balloon they released. This information was given to the information officer at Edwards AFB.

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards AF Base UFO Sighting - 2 May 57

not have been a balloon is not valid. In fact, the data supplied throughout the report (exact geographical locations of balloon site, observers' positions, metro data, precise computations as to angles or elevation, bearings and altitude, among others) indicate that it is highly improbable that the object was other than a balloon.

c. A comparative analysis of the data from the UFO questionnaire and the data derived from scientific instruments and actual official time-tracks of the balloon launched indicate the following:

(1) Testimony given by both observers is that the time of their sighting was between 0755 and 0820 (see attached copy of UFO Questionnaire, Form 164).

(2) A rawinsonde balloon was released by the Edwards AFB weather station, west of the observers, at 0740 hours and accurately tracked until 0820 hours (UFO Report, 14 May 1957).

(3) Observers both estimate the bearing of the object to be 75 degrees when it first appeared, presumably at 0755.

(4) Official time-tracking of the balloon (UFO Report, 15 May 57) was as follows:
(a) 0750: True Bearing - 70 degrees
(b) 0800: True Bearing - 80 degrees
(c) 0810: True Bearing - 60 degrees

(5) Therefore, interpolating for the first two time-tracks, the bearing is exactly 75 degrees. Using an average of all three, the results are 70 degrees.

(6) Observers' state that when first observed, their estimated angle of elevation of the object was 45 degrees, and 15 degrees when it disappeared.

(7) A trigonometrical treatment of the data in the official UFO Report (paragraph 1a(11)) indicates that the angle of elevation during the periods given by the observers was approximately 30 degrees and 23 degrees respectively.

d. It has been repeatedly proven that without accurate instruments and devices, a person skilled can estimate angles against the sky within 10 to 20 degrees of the actual elevations, particularly, in areas other than directly overhead or on the horizon.

e. Therefore, allowing for the known inability of the average person to correctly estimate angles and time, computed times, bearings, and elevations of the balloon released, almost perfectly coincide with the figures given by the observers.

    (a) Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations.

    (b) Weather stations at Palmdale Airport, George Air Force Base, Mojave MCAS, and China Lake Naval Air Station were queried as to whether any weather balloons had been released at or about the time of sighting. Reply in each case was negative. A rawinsonde balloon was released by the weather station at Edwards Air Force Base at approximately 0740 hours Pacific Daylight Time, 2 May 1957. The following information on the release of subject balloon:

    0740 hours. . Balloon released at Edwards (34° 54'
                   33" N - 117° 52' 00" E).
    0750 hours. . 13,287' elevation, 8038 yards from
                   station on a true bearing of 70°.
    0800 hours. . 22,802' elevation, 16,295 yards from
                   station on a true bearing of 80°.
    0810 hours. . 34,481' elevation, 27,658 yards from
                   station on a true bearing of 60°.
    0820 hours. . 44,291' elevation, 38,603 yards from
                   station on a true bearing of 40°.

    Based on the above track made and the location of the observers at the time of sighting, the weather balloon released at Edwards could not have been the unidentified object reported.

    (c) Probable cause of sighting is unknown.

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards AF Base UFO Sighting - 2 May 57

f. Further factual data to support hypothesis that object was balloon:

(1) Reference balloon launching site and observers' location given in UFO report. These two points are approximately 20,000 yards apart. It is significant to note that the observers were almost due east and slightly south of the balloon launching site (see sketch, enclosure #4).

(2) Reference winds aloft in UFO report. The prevailing winds at that time were blowing due east.

(3) Reference paragraph 1a(2), azimuths of first sightings. If a time-track of the balloon released, due east, is plotted from the weather station to and east of observers' location at the time given in the UFO report (which states the observers first saw the object at due north) the object would have passed exactly due north of their location (see sketch, enclosure #4).

(4) Reference paragraph 1a(1)(a) of UFO report. Object traveled in easterly direction at all times. It appeared to stand still, change shape and pulsate. These are the typical characteristics of balloons, and supported by hundreds of UFO reports found to be balloons.

g. At 1030 hours, 24 May 1957, M/Sgt O. D. Hill, NCOIC, Aerial Phenomena Group, contacted Detachment #21, 4th Weather Group, Edwards AFB, regarding further details on the balloon aspects of the case. In conversations with Major Wininger, the following were discussed:

(1) The balloon released at 0740 on that date measures approximately 6 to 7 feet at launching, and can expand to 70 to 90 feet at 60,000 feet.

(2) Major Wininger stated that the alleged UFO was obviously this balloon.

(3) Further, Major Wininger stated that this information was given to the Information Services Officer of Edwards AFB. (M/Sgt Hill's report is attached as enclosure #5).

h. Of significance is the fact that the radar unit for that locality reported that there was no unidentified object in the air at that time.

3. Analysis of Theodolite Photographs of UFO: Based on a study and analysis of the series of theodolite photographs submitted to this Center, the following are considered comments pertinent to the incident:

a. In the UFO questionnaire, both observers report that the object was about 150 to 175 feet in diameter. Yet the object on the photographs, after being photographed and the photo enlarged 7 diameters, was scarcely larger than the width of the cross hairs.

BALLOON CHECK ON EDWARDS AFB CASE

As per telephone conversation with Major Wininger, Detachment 21, 4th Weather Group, Edwards AFB, California.

Major Wininger is aware of the facts of this case and he stated, (quote) "On the morning of 2 May 1957, 7:40 PDT they released a Ravinsonde balloon which at release measured 3 or 5 to 6 feet in diameter, which reaches at diameter of 75 to 90 ft. at 60,000 ft. altitude." Major Wininger also stated that this sighting is quite obviously the balloon they released. This information was given to the information officer at Edwards AFB.

b. It is difficult to understand why it was decided to photograph an object that was in sight for almost 30 minutes, after it was a mere speck in the sky.

c. Both observers state object 5,000 feet away when first seen, and approximately 60 miles away when last seen. A photo analysis based on the image sizes on the photos, magnifications, focal lengths of lenses, and other data, using standard optical formulas and equations for distance, up to 60 miles show that an object must be a minimum of 92 feet in diameter to be seen even as a speck at a 60 mile distance, assuming ideal atmospheric conditions and the ability of the lens to resolve the image.

d. Using a more realistic distance, 9 to 12 miles, the object would read be a minimum of 5 to 7 feet in diameter. This correlates with the diameter of the balloon actually released. (Analysis of the theodolite photography is attached; see inclosure #5.)

e. It should be noted that practically half of the image sizes are .013 of a foot at their longest dimension. Plotting a number of points along the .013 line, from 60 to 6 miles, indicates the minimum object size discernible, ranges from approximately 80 feet to 6 feet. This correlates well with the data given this Center by the 4th Weather Group at Edwards AFB. See paragraph 27(3) above.

f. A study of 25 consecutive enlargements reveals that the tiny white object alternately changes from elliptical (described as a disc by observers) to round in shape. No clear features are discernible. This changing shapes are generally similar to photographs taken of balloon or weather balloon bright daylight areas. It should be noted that the sun was due east at this time and not too far above the horizon. The effects of specular reflection of light on rounded surfaces is well known. Weird and unusual appearances can be created.

4. Comments Regarding Sources: Consistent with the principles of concentrating on the source in any UFO analysis or conclusions, the following points are considered pertinent:

a. Inconsistencies

(1) In their personal report as given in the UFO questionnaire, both observers state the object was an bearing (azimuth) of 75 degrees when first seen, and when it disappeared.

(2) The UFO report from Edwards AFB quotes the observers as saying that they first observed the object at due north, (0 degrees azimuth) and that when it disappeared, it was also at due north. All points have been resolved satisfactorily, except the last, in which both observers state (in their questionnaire) that the object disappeared to the east.

(3) In both the official UFO report and their questionnaire, they stated that the object was the size of a basketball held at arms
