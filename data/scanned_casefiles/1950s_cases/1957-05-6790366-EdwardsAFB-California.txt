The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book report. There is no visible photograph in this image, only text describing a reported UFO sighting over the "United States secret testing grounds" at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

The text describes how the object was observed by a camera crew, who took a series of photographs as the object moved away. The object is described as changing shape from round to elliptical, with a "wind pat" correlated with its movements. The report states that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements could not be made to confirm the object's size, elevation and bearings.

The case is considered to have been "improperly handled" and the Edwards AFB PIO officer made statements that it was "unknown", noting that further local inquiries could have helped solve the case.

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards Air Force Base UFO Sighting - 2 May 57
TO: Director of Intelligence, USAF
Headquarters, USAF
ATTN: AFOIN-X 
(Mr. Sanderson)

1. Generally, this analysis is based on the careful review and study of all case data and information submitted on this case. The analysis is in three parts:

a. Study of the observer's UFO questionnaire, the official UFO report form, and all information pertinent to the sighting itself, including geographical factors, and the elements of time, elevations, bearings, and other associated conditions pertinent to the sighting.

b. Analysis of the declite photographs submitted, with correlation to the known facts.

c. Evaluation of the sources (observers).

2. Analysis of UFO Report and Questionnaire Data:

a. UFO report, photographs, and questionnaire as accomplished by the observers were not received by this Center until 23 May 1957, (see inclosures #1, #2, and #3) and considerably after the incident had reached both the press and the public.

b. Reference page 3, item (11)(a) of UFO report. The attempted analysis of this sighting by officers examining the report to the effect that it could not have been a balloon is NOT valid. In fact, the data supplied throughout the report (see geographical location of balloon sites, observers' positions, metro data, precise computations as to angles or elevation, bearings and altitudes, among others) would indicate that this is highly improbable that this was not a balloon sight. Observers' positions, metro data, precise computations as to angles or elevation, bearings and altitudes, among others) indicate this.

c. A comparative analysis of the data from the UFO questionnaire and the data derived from scientific instruments and actual official time-tracks of the balloons launched would indicate the following:

(1) Testimony given by both observers is that the time of their sighting was between 0755 and 0830 (see attached copy of UFO Questionnaire, Form 164).
(2) A radiosonde balloon was released by the Edwards AFB weather station, west of the observers, at 0749 hours and accurately tracked until 0330 hours (UFO Report, 11 May 1957).
(3) Observers both estimate the bearing of the object to be 75 degrees when it first appeared, presumably at 0755.

- page 13 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text describing the official time-tracking of a balloon (UFO Report, 15 May 57).

Transcription of the text in the document:

(1.) OFFICIAL time-tracking of the balloon (UFO Report, 15 May 57)
was as follows:
(a) 0750: True Bearing - 70 degrees
(b) 0800: True Bearing - 80 degrees 
(c) 0810: True Bearing - 60 degrees
(3.) Therefore, interpolating for the first two time-tracks, the bearing is exactly 75 degrees. Using an average of all three, the result is 70 degrees.
(6) Observation tends to show that when first observed, the estimated angle of elevation of the object was 11 degrees, and 10 degrees when disappearance.
(7) A trigonometrical treatment of the data in the official UFO Report (Appendix A(I)) indicates that the angle of elevation during the period given by the observer was approximately 30 degrees.
d. It has been repeatedly proven that without accurate instruments and devices, a person cannot reliably estimate within 10 to 20 degrees of the actual elevations, particularly in areas where such distractions overshadow the horizon.
e. Therefore, allowing for the known inability of the average person to correctly estimate angles and times, the bearings and elevations of the balloon released, almost perfectly coincide with the figures given by the observers.
f. Further factual data to support hypothesis that object was balloon:
(1) Reference balloon launching site and observers' location given in UFO report. - These two points are approximately 20,000 yards apart. It is significant to note that the observers were almost due east and slightly south of the balloon launching site.
(2) Reference winds aloft in UFO report. The prevailing winds at that time were blowing due east.
(3) Reference paragraph 1(c): the location of first sighting, if the time-track of the balloon released, due east, is plotted from the weather station to and east of observers' location at the time given in the UFO report (which states the observers first saw the object would have passed them), the object would have been exactly due north of their location (see sketch, enclosure #1).

- page 14 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text output from the document:

Reference paragraph la(1)(a) of UFO Report. Object traveled in easterly direction at all times. It appeared to be round, 50 to 60 feet in diameter, lighted, and gave off a brilliant light. Characteristics of balloons, and supported by hundreds of lUF observers found to be balloons.

2. At 1030 hours, 24 May 1957, M/Sgt O. D. HILL, MOORE, Aerial Phenomena Group, contacted detachment #21, 4th Weather Group, Edwards AFB, regarding further details on the balloon aspects of the case. In conversations with Hill, the following data was obtained:

(1) The balloon released at 0710 on that date measures approximately 6 to 7 feet at launching, and can expand to 70 to 80 feet.
(2) Major Winenger stated that the alleged UFO was obviously this balloon.
(3) Further, Major Winenger stated that this information was given to the Information Service Office, Edwards AFB, (7/76/58 Hill's report attached as inclosure #5.)

3. Analysis of Theodolite Photographs of UFO: Based on a study and analysis of the theodolite photographs submitted to this Center, the following are considered comments pertinent to the incident:

a. In the UFO question, both observers report that the object was about 150 to 175 feet in diameter. Yet the object on the photographs, after being photographed and the photographs enlarged (7 diameters), was noticeably larger than the width of the cross hairs.
b. It is difficult to understand why it was decided to photograph an object that was in sight for almost 30 minutes, after it was a mere speck.
c. Both observers state object 5,000 feet away when first seen, and approximately 60 miles away when last seen. This analysis based on the image details in the photographs suggests an object at a maximum of 10 to 12 miles, the object would need be a minimum of 52 feet in diameter to be a minimum of 52 feet in diameter to be the observed size at 60 miles distance, assuming ideal atmospheric conditions and the ability of the lens to resolve the image.
d. Using a more realistic distance, of 10 to 12 miles, the object would need be a minimum of 5 to 7 feet in diameter. This correlates with the dimensions of the balloon usually released. (Analysis of the theodolite photography is attached; see inclosure #6.)

e. It should be noted that practically half of the image sizes are at or within 0.013 of their longest dimension indicating a number of points along the track of the object.

- page 15 -

The image does not contain any photographs. The text provided appears to be excerpts from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

the .013 line, from 60 down to 6 miles, indicates that the minimum object size discernible ranges from approximately 30 feet to 6 feet. This correlates well with the data given in (2) above by the 5th Weather Group at Edwards.
f. A study of 25 consecutive enlargements reveal that the tiny white object alternately changes from elliptical (described as a disc by observers) to round in shape. No close-up photos have been taken, and all measurements are derived from estimates of the object's size and its distance from observers. One estimate states that the object remained over a bright daylight area for approximately ten minutes. It should be noted that the sun was due east at this time and not low for above the horizon. The effect of moonlight reflection on light-colored rounded surfaces is well known. Weird and unusual appearances can be created.
4. Comments Regarding Sources: Consistent with the principles of commenting on any UFO analysis, the following points are considered pertinent:
a. Inconsistances
(1) In their personal report as given in the UFO questionnaire, both observers state the object was at a bearing (azimuth) of 75 degrees when it disappeared.
(2) The UFO report from Edwards AFB quotes the observers as saying that the object disappeared at the same bearing (75 degrees azimuth) and that when it disappeared, it was the size of a dime. All investigators have verified this factor.
(3) In both the official UFO report and their questionnaire, they state that the size of a basketball held at arms length. A simple demonstration will quickly indicate that a basketball held in front of one's eyes at this distance will cover almost half of the visible sky, and would be an indication that the object observed at 5,000 feet distance. The object, in actuality, would be almost a 1/2 mile wide.
b. Belief in "Flying Saucers"
(1) One observer has given strong indications that he is a believer in the so-called "flying saucers."
(2) Stated that he observed a "disc-like" the size of a football shield hanging over a house for twenty minutes.

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

I am a member of the NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA, and my interest in flying saucers is very great.

About the sighting of a UFO photographed at Edwards Air Force Base? I was told that no such photographs were taken. I would like for you to verify this information, and that the films were immediately impounded by special agent equipment and that the films were forwarded to Air Technical Intelligence Center in Dayton, Ohio.

Well, if the film of the UFO should be exceptional, I would like to know what ATIC thinks about the films. If they do show what ATIC thinks about the films, if they do show what ATIC thinks are genuine UFOs, then it would be most important for the public to be told.

Also I have learned that well-known magazine writers were assigned by a national magazine to investigate the truth about flying saucers from the standpoint of the Air Force. But the article apparently never appeared. I would be interested in the results of this investigation, if any.

If I just can not understand why ATIC turned down the offer to print "the truth about flying saucers" or why ATIC could not have a book and demand "tome "to be well known of an official government report on UFO information is making to be more fantastic than the UFOTs "Mr. May" a report will make the Americans public even more confusing.

Most sincerely,

Dear Mr. [redacted],

The UFO photographed at Edwards Air Force Base in May was a balloon which was launched as a nearby launching site. 

The Air Force does not have sufficient personnel to furnish detailed information regarding each case files to the many persons who wish to write for profit on the subject of UFO's. Any attempt to publish such details would certainly curtail the essential functions of the Air Force and would be an unwarranted expenditure of public funds. You may recall however, that some time ago the Air Force in the interest of public information, cooperated with the national magazines, Life and Saturday Evening Post, in the preparation of articles on the subject of UFO's.

It is requested that you refer any persons requesting the film and information on the recent Edwards AFB incident to this Office, since the photos and UFO reports are not permitted to be released until more than two weeks after the date of the request.
The original film is in repository with the UFO files. Any decision to release the film and detailed data to this organization must come from higher levels. In our opinion, any exception made in favor of one individual or organization will undoubtedly result in a flood of requests from the others. The requested reply was drafted with this in mind.

Dear Mr.

Captain Marley has requested that we answer your letter of 31 March 1958, since some of the information you requested is in our files of confidential material. 

First, regarding your request for the procedure to obtain footage from the military services for motion pictures, this is covered by existing Air Force regulations. The procedure may be purchased by a representative of your organization. Approved scripts are required in advance of this production. Approved scripts are forwarded to the appropriate film depository where the footage may be selected for purchase such footage as is commensurate with the production plans of the Department of Defense.

I should caution you again, that good motion picture footage is not always available from any official source. As was pointed out in earlier correspondence, exhaustive research has not disclosed any authentic evidence that would indicate the existence of flying saucers. Therefore, the Air Force does not have any special film that would radiate on a television screen.

As you will re-read your correspondence, dated 31 June 1957, from Major Robert J. Friend, you will note that there is not any such film in our possession. You should also add, since you cited Mr. Ruppelt's book, that it was claimed only for security purposes and in fact a disclaimer for factual accuracy was made at that time by the Department of Defense.

Dear Captain Harley:

Thank you for your cordial and informative communication of 28 February. Your continued cooperation and patience - is appreciated.

Essentially, I shall keep in touch with your office as the script to my projected documentary progresses. However, the narrative will not substantially vary from the basic facts and information already obtained. And since the script of this post-narrated film will depend precisely on what data is available, including the negative (photos) to be made available, I hope you will so advise the Department of Defense.

Do you know when I may expect to receive everything? But I am certain that all will receive everything, and I intend to discuss with you just what I learn from the material as soon as it is all in my hands.

There is another point that I wish you would clarify. With reference to my inquiry into the availability of your motion pictures of the Autonomous Regions of the Antarctica or the Arctic, requested has been checked by the Department of the Air Force, and there are no such films available.

This reply has been a bit mystified. One of the films about which I was also mysteriously over at Edwards AFB, Calif., on 9 May 1957, and I have a letter from Captain Ruppelt there relative to this plane crash incident.

As to the gun-camera shot near Wright-Patterson AFB on 20 August, 1952, the light which the camera to focus to free itself from this objet that was scanned by radar and seen by ground watchers and which was immediately released by to be TRUE by the Air Force.

TO MY PROJECT DOESSANTARY PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, THE POSITION REMAINS THAT OF THE LAST REPORT, NAMELY: THE LACK OF TIME AND SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON WHICH TO ACT.

SO YOU CAN SEE THAT I AM IN A RATHER NERVOUS POSITION AT THE MOMENT, AND I WONDER IF YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL ME JUST WHAT TO DO.

THERE IS ANOTHER POINT THAT I WISH YOU WOULD CLARIFY - WITH RESPECT TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT MENTIONED. WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC FOOTAGE THAT YOU HAVE REQUESTED. I HOPE YOU WILL RESPOND. THE SPECIFIC FOOTAGE THAT I HAVE WILL DEPEND UPON SOME DEFINITE INFORMATION FROM YOU.

THIS REPLY HAS BEEN A BIT HURRIED. ONE OF THE FILMS ABOUT WHICH I WROTE TO CAPTAIN EDWARDS HAS, CALIF., ON MAY 6, 1957 AND I HAVE A LETTER FROM HIM REGARDING SAME IN SOME DETAIL.

I BELIEVE THE GUN-CAMERA ACTION THAT MAJOR WRIGHT-PATTERSON ARE ON 30 AUGUST 1957 TO BE CONCLUSIVE FOR A PERIOD OF 3 TO 5 MINUTES. AND I HAVE CONSIDERABLE DETAIL ON THIS, CONFIRMED BY SEVERAL SOURCES - OBSERVATIONS BY GROUND WATCHERS IN THE AREA, RADAR TRACK, VISUAL CONTACT, ETC. YOUR LETTER OF FEBRUARY 28 DOES NOT MENTION THIS POINT AND I WONDER IF YOU ARE AWARE OF IT.

AND THE WHITE SANDS CINEMATOGRAPHIC FILMS REFERRED TO BY GENERAL RAMSEY IN THEIR O.S.I. COMMAND LIAISON LETTER OF DECEMBER 5, 1956, WILL VERIFY WHAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED.

22 June 1957

Dear Dr. __________,

Reference is made to your letter dated 12 June 1957 concerning a report from a weather unit stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

My initial comments are that while I understand that this individual has made what he considers to be a significant and worthwhile observation, it is nevertheless my feeling that in the absence of any tangible evidence or documentation to support his allegations, his recourse to official files, reports and findings is premature and such matters are more appropriately directed to other agencies.

It is my attempt to meet the individual demands of the hundreds who periodically make similar unsolicited reports, that I must emphasize the constant interference with the Air Force's normal mission, and the disproportionate expenditure of time and resources required to investigate each case, which invariably proves to be without substance. My correspondence is withheld in an effort to avoid raising false hopes or expectations on the part of our citizens.

If you consider this report to be of sufficient importance, I would be pleased to have it informally reviewed by technical personnel who are experienced in the analysis of such reports. However, I would suggest that the individual be informed of the following:

1. The object reported by the observer is not considered to be other than a thermal inversion or a meteorological condition which is commonly misinterpreted as some unusual aerial phenomenon.

2. Unless substantiated by an independent report which discloses significant details beyond the observer's personal estimates as to size, speed, altitude, etc., this report cannot be considered as evidence of any unusual or unidentified aerial object.

3. There is no record in official files of any recovery of unusual objects or materials from the area of the observer's location.

Should the individual wish to submit any further evidence or documentation, I would be pleased to have it reviewed and an appropriate reply forwarded to you.

Sincerely yours,

On Thursday, May 9, 1957, The Los Angeles Times reported the following:

'AIR FORCE STUDIES PHOTOS --- Cameras Track Flying Object'

'Cameramen Studies of an unidentified flying object photographs were analyzed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base yesterday.

'Spokesmen at the secret report test center north of Los Angeles said the object was spotted by cameramen.'

'They tracked the object and took pictures with the cameras and information were dispatched immediately to the intelligence center.'

'It caught the morning sun and that it moved but not at any tremendous speed, the witnesses said. The object appeared round, that was spotted by more than one camera crew.'

'Edwards officers would not hazard a guess as to what the object was, although one said it could have been a weather balloon.'

'This desert air does crazy things,' he said."

A request is hereby made for prints from the negative film on this incident, to be distributed by USAF to the technical and scientific community as fully as possible. If this is not feasible on a short-term basis, or through the local USAF, the writer would appreciate a copy of the photo-analysis report and any other material that might be available on this incident, in cooperation between the Air Force and civilian interested parties. Such an exchange would be in the public interest.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which describes the details of a UFO sighting that received nationwide publicity. 

The text in the document is as follows:

"This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was observed over the so-called "United States secret testing grounds", and had been photographed officially by high-speed cameras, especially designed to track aircraft and missiles, by AF personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crews, who took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. They later described it as "disc shaped to interrogators", after they brought the matter to the attention of higher authority. A total of 32 photographs were taken, and highly magnified, disclosed the object to be the size of a match head, but changing shape from elliptical to circular, as the early sun's rays played upon its surface. A wind jet, correlated with the reported speed and movements of the object, practically coincided. This pointed to the object being a balloon. Further investigations not only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements coincided with the observer's report as to times, elevations and bearings.

This case is considered as having been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of ATIC until well after the press had received it; the Edwards AFB I-IO officer made statements to the press that it was "unknown", when investigators disclose that he was informed it was a balloon; and the local commander could have solved the case by making local inquiries of his various entities."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes an unidentified object sighting at Edwards Air Force Base on May 2, 1957. The text states that the sighting was investigated by civilian photo-theodolite operators who took pictures with "specialized camera equipment", but the results were inconclusive and no estimates were made regarding the size or altitude of the object. The officers involved were unsure of what the object was, although one said it could have been a balloon.

MAY 2, 1957: An unidentified object was sighted over Edwards Air Force Base in California. Civilian photo-theodolite operators were dispatched and took pictures with the "specialized camera equipment." Results were dispatched to intelligence headquarters, but the Intelligence Division reported that the results were inconclusive and there were no estimates as to its size or altitude. Edwards officers would not hazard a guess as to what the object was, although one said it could have been a balloon. Others, such as Lt. Isabel Epperson, of L.A., for California clippings.)

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document discussing requests for information concerning balloon launchings between 0700 and 0930 hours on 2 May 1957 involving large plastic balloons of 45 to 75 foot size. The document mentions weekly track charts from 1110 Sub Gp, Hecdcom, USAF, showing balloon S-321 from Vernallis passing north of the area, moving west to east on the same date. The document also includes handwritten notes at the bottom.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
This questionnaire has been prepared so that you can give the U.S. Air Force as much information as possible concerning the sighted phenomena that you have observed. Please try to answer as many questions as you possibly can. The information that you give will be used in a statistical analysis to determine patterns. Your answers will not be used for any other purpose without your permission.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a "Detailed Analysis of Edwards AFB Base UFO Sighting - 2 May 57".

The text in the report is as follows:

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards AFB Base UFO Sighting - 2 May 57
a. Length: A simple demonstration will quickly indicate that a baseball, when its length is seen in a front of one's eyes at this distance, will cover almost half of the visible sky, and would be an indication that the object observed would be tremendous in size, if an actual object.
b. Belief in "Flying Saucers":
(1) One observer has given strong indications that he is a believer in the so-called "flying saucers".
(2) Stated that he observed a "disc" almost half the size of a football field hanging over a house for twenty minutes. Time and place was Rosemead, California, 0930 p.m. in January '50. The object did not make a sound while within vision.
(3) No comment is considered necessary regarding an object that size over a small town for almost half hour and not being seen by any other persons or aircraft, or by radar that seems to view 24 hours a day.
(4) The observers were specialists in a field of photography. It should therefore be apparent to them that even a previously known object would be difficult to estimate as being 60 miles, much less it appearing on a relatively distant small, distant object. The photographic equipment used would not have been capable of determining that distance with the equipment used.
5. Conclusions: Therefore, on the basis of the above, and particularly in consideration of the factual data presented, which clearly indicates an object other than the balloon sighted, was observed for only a few minutes prior to the sighting.
6. This Center considers it unfortunate that its knowledge of this incident was withheld. It was brought to both the public and press attention days before, and proved that a denial or explanation is never given the same publicity or attention as the original story.

NAME: [redacted]
SIGNATURE: [redacted]
DATE: May 1957

At 0755 hours we were traveling south in a pickup truck to Atlanta Genera Station to investigate a UFO sighting. As we approached the Georgia coast at about 1517 hours we sighted the object over the ocean. It was heading eastward at high speed and was not visible to the naked eye. By the time we got the binoculars on it, it disappeared from our view. It was estimated to be between 40 to 50 miles per hour in speed, and it disappeared in further easterly direction. It was estimated to be 50,000 feet in altitude. I further observed it was egg-shaped, silver in color, and about the size of a dime held at arm's length. There were some more falls of it. It was estimated to be 30 to 50 miles away when it disappeared. It was observed only for about 60 miles when it disappeared from sight.

We left this master station heading south for one mile when we turned east for approximately 1 to 1.5 miles. At this point we turned north and traveled about 1 mile before we turned west again. While traveling this circuit, we observed and tracked an unidentified object which appeared to be traveling erratically in the sky. The object continued to the Ashland station and overhead and seemed to accelerate. From this time travel to the Ashland station had become normal and no further observation of the object was made. The time when we first observed the object was approximately 10:00 p.m. and it was observed for approximately 25 to 30 minutes before it was lost out of sight.

d. Edwards AFB B Case (2 May 1957)

This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was over successfully near the Edwards Aib Base and had seen photographed officially by high-speed cameras, especially designed to track missiles by AP personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crew, who, took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. The sighting was directly related to the official Air Force investigation. Prior to the official Air Force investigation, the object could be described as the size of a match head, but changing shape from round to elongated as the object played upon the surface. A wind blew, correlated with the reported speed and movement of the object, practically coincided. This pointed to the object being in the air balloon.i Further investigation, not only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise sightings measurements coincided with the observers' reports as to times, elevations and bearings.

This case is considered to have been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of ATIC until after the press had received it; the Edwards AFB official made statements to the press that it was "unknown" which investigations disclose that they had been informed that it was a balloon: some local confusion to statements to the press indicating it was a balloon, and interviews investigator also indicated it was an unknown object but they had no evidence to support this conclusion; the various units of the investigation had not been properly and fully coordinated.

Edwards AFB Case (2 May 1957)

This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was observed over the so-called "United States secret testing grounds", and had been photographed officially by high-speed cameras, specially designed to track aircraft and missiles. by AF personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crews, who took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. They later described it as disc-shaped to interrogators, after they brought the matter to the attention of others. A study of 32 photographs taken, and highly magnified disclosed the object to the size of a match head, but changing shape from round to elliptical, as the object rapidly moved upon its surface, a motion correlated with the reported speed and movement of the object, practically coincided. This pointed to the object being a balloon. Further investigations not only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements coincided with the observer's report as to its size, elevation and bearings. 

This case is considered as having been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of ATIC until will after the Edwards AFB PIO officer made statements to the press that it was "unknown". When investigations disclosed that he was informed it was a balloon, and the local commander could have solved the case by making local inquiries of his various units.

BALLOON CHECK ON EDWARDS AFB CASE

As per telephone conversation with Major Weininger, Department Gl, Weather Group, Edwards AFB, California, Major Weininger is aware of the facts of this case and he states:

(quote) "On the morning of 3 May 1957, they released a Rawindonde balloon which at release measured 980 grams or 3 to 6 feet, in diameter, which reached an altitude of 75 to 80 feet. at 60,000 ft. altitude." Major Weininger also stated that this sighting is quite obviously the balloon they released. This information was given to the information officer at Edwards AFB.

OUTPUT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards AFB Base UFO Sighting - 2 May 57

(1) Testimony given by both observers is that the time of their sighting was between 0755 and 0820 (see attached copy of UFO questionnaire, Form 14-C).

(2) A rawinsonde balloon was released by the Edwards AFB weather station west of the observers, at 0745 hours and subsequently tracked until 0320 hours (UFO Report, 14 May 1957).

(3) Observers both estimate the bearing of the object to be 75 degrees when it first appears, continuing at 075 degrees.

(4) Official time-tracking of the balloon (UFO Report, 15 May 57) was as follows:
(a) 0750: True Bearing - 70 degrees
(b) 0800: True Bearing - 80 degrees
(c) 0810: True Bearing - 60 degrees

(5) Observers: interpolating for the first two time-tracks, the bearing is exactly 75 degrees. Using an average of all three, the bearing is 70 degrees.

(6) Observers' state that when first observed, their estimated altitude of the object was 45 degrees, and 15 degrees when it disappeared.

(7) A trigonometrical treatment of the data in the official UFO Report (Paragraph 6 (1)) indicates that the angle of elevation during the periods given by the observers was approximately 50 degrees and 22 degrees respectively.

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards AF Base UFO Sighting - 9 May 57

a. Further factual data to support hypotheses that object was balloon:
(1) Reference to balloon launching site and observers' location given in UFO reports. These two points are approximately 20,000 yards apart. It is significant to note that the observers were almost due east and slightly south of the balloon launching site.
(2) Reference winds aloft in UFO reports. The prevailing winds at that time were blowing due south.
(3) Reference paragraph 1a(2), azimuths of first sightings. If a time-height relationship is assumed, due east, it is plotted from the weather station to end east of observers' location at the time given in the UFO report (which states the observers first saw the object at due north) the object would have passed out of sight inasmuch as the observers first saw the object at due north.
(4) Reference paragraph 1a(11)(a) of UFO report. Object traveled in generally circular course and all times appeared to stand still, change shape and pulsate. These are the typical characteristics of balloons and supported by hundreds of UFO reports found to contain no other explanation.

e. At 1030 hours, 9 May 1957, Maj C. D. Hill, MCOIC, Aerial Phenomena Group, contacted Detachment #21, 4th Weather Group, Edwards AFB, regarding further details on the balloon information mentioned above the following:
(1) The balloon released at 0740 on that date, measures approximately 60 to 70 feet at launching, and can expand to 70 to 90 feet.
(2) Major Wininger stated that the alleged UFO was obviously this balloon.
(3) Further, Major Wininger stated that this information was given as routine information Service Officer of Edwards AFB.

3. Analysis of Theodolite Photographs of UFO: Based on a study and analysis of the series of Theodolite photographic prints, the following are considered comments pertinent to the incident:
In the UFO questionnaire, both observers report that the object was about 150 to 175 feet in diameter. Yet the object on the photographs examined 7 minutes after the observers first saw it was scarcely larger than the width of the cross hairs.

BALLOON CHECK ON EDWARDS AFB CASE

As per telephone conversation with Major Wininger, Detachment 21, 4th Weather Group, Edwards AFB, California.

Major Wininger is aware of the facts of this case and he stated, (quote) "On the morning of 2 May 1957, 7:40 PDT they released a Rawinsonde balloon which at release measured 300-500 grams or 5 to 6 feet in diameter, which reaches at diameter of 75 to 90 ft. at 60,000 ft. altitude" Major Wininger also stated that this sighting is quite obviously the balloon they released. This information was given to the information officer at Edwards AFB.

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF EDWARDS AFB BASE UFO SIGHTING - 2 MAY 57

a. It is difficult to understand why it was decided to photograph an object that was in sight for allmost 20 minutes, and the it was a mere speck in the sky.

b. Both observers state object 5,000 feet away when first seen, and approximately 60 miles away when last seen. A photo analysis based on the image size shows the object had a diameter of 30 to 40 feet, and was seen at distances up to 60 miles. This shows that an object must be a minimum of 52 feet in diameter to be seen even as a speck at that distance.

c. Using a more realistic distance, 9 to 12 miles, the object would need to be a minimum of 5 to 7 feet in diameter. This correlates with the diameter of the balloon actually released. (Analyzed on the photography as attached - see inclosure 75).

d. It would be noted that practically half of the image sizes are over a foot at their longest dimension. Plotting a number of points along the 6 by 9 inch frame, down to 5 inches, indicates the minimum object size discernable ranges from approximately 80 feet to 6 feet. This correlates well with the data shown that the object size observed AFB was 50-90 feet (see paragraph 2f(2) above).

e. A study of 25 consecutive enlargements reveal that the tiny white object alternatively changes from elliptical (described as a disc by observers) to round in shape. The changing shapes are considered the results of optical illusions or distortion, caused by turbulent air masses. It should be noted that the sun was due east at this time and not too far above the horizon. The effects of specular reflection of light on rounded surfaces is well known. Weird and unusual appearances can be created.

f. Comments Regarding Sources: Consistent with the principles of concern on this subject in any UFO analysis or conclusions, the following points are considered:
a. Inconsistencies

(1) In their personal report as given in the UFO questionnaire, both observers state the object was a blurry (luminous) of 75 degrees when first seen, and when it disappeared.
(2) The UFO report from Edwards AFB quotes the observers as saying that they first observed the object at a nearer distance of 5,000 feet, but it was still circular and clear in outline. This contradicts the questionnaire statement (1) above.
(3) In both the official UFO report and their questionnaire, they stated that the object was the size of a basketball held at arm's

27 MARCH 1957
DATA:
At 0800 hours on March 27, 1957, an object was observed moving in the sky over the Edwards Air Force Base, California. The object was first detected by radar personnel and subsequently observed visually. The radar personnel reported the object to be rectangular in shape, approximately 12 feet long and 3 feet wide, moving in a northeasterly direction at an altitude of 15,000 feet. The object was observed visually for a period of about 10 minutes by several witnesses on the ground. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and displayed no lights or other identifying markings. It moved at a uniform speed and in a straight line until it disappeared from view.

7th WEATHER SQUADRON
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA

ON 6 MAY 1957, AT APPROXIMATELY 2300 HOURS, I WAS ON DUTY IN THE WEATHER SQUADRON OPERATIONS ROOM AT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA, WHEN I NOTICED SEVERAL BRIGHT FLASHES OF LIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW. I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUTSIDE TO INVESTIGATE.

UPON GOING OUTSIDE, I SAW TWO BRIGHT OBJECTS TRAVELING IN THE SOUTHWESTERN SKY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE OBJECTS WERE BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR AND OBLONG IN SHAPE. THEY APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH AND WERE VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 15-20 SECONDS BEFORE DISAPPEARING.

I IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE OPERATIONS ROOM AND NOTIFIED THE DUTY OFFICER. WE BOTH OBSERVED THE OBJECTS THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE OPERATIONS ROOM. THE OBJECTS WERE SPOTTED AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER, TRAVELING IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION.
