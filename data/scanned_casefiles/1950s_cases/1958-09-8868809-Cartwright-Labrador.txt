Text from the document:

SEPTEMBER 16, - 18, 1958 

All Lit-Up... 
Sky: That is...

Does reports called -- it atic 
(claims sights) night reports...

An attempt has now been made to record 
reports of unusual sky lights, flashes, and other 
lighted objects seen in the sky. This does not 
mean that these objects are necessarily "Identified 
Flying Objects", but rather, a collection of 
reports of certain unusual sky phenomena.
