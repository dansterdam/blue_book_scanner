LEVELLAND, TEXAS "BLUE LIGHT" CASE
2 NOVEMBER 1957

Five witnesses report seeing objects in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas in the early morning hours of 2 November 1957. The objects observed were reported to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter and surrounded by a blue glow. The description of the UFOs is that they were found to be in a stationary position, with their lights extinguished and a flame of white lights at several of the witnesses reported that the estimated duration of the sightings was approximately 20 seconds. On 4 November 1957, a witness reported an UFO observed and the object rose and disappeared into the base of the clouds.  

The incident on 2 November 1957 was a 1,000 foot overcast, visibility three miles, light and variable winds from the northwest. The incident on 4 November 1957, thick heavy clouds.

It is concluded that the cause of the sightings on 2 November 1957 was probably a weather phenomenon. The cause for the witnesses' observations could be attributed to a meteorological situation, possibly phosphorescence. In one instance, a faulty distributor was determined as being the cause for the sighting under consideration.

The object sighted on 4 November 1957 was probably a weather balloon, for which identification is claimed.

SUBJ: Request for Air Science Division Review of Levelland Case

What effect does a nearby lightning discharge have on the water droplets in the air, and what effect does this have on the sighting of a low-flying ball lightning phenomenon?

A request is made for the Air Science Division, in collaboration with other USAF units as necessary, to determine or give their opinion on the hypothesis that a nearby lightning discharge could have caused an effect on the water droplets in the air that may have influenced the sighting of the low-flying ball lightning phenomenon.

The formal request is made to be sent to Washington and/or turned over to the TV group, because the case file will be needed for analysis and the material required by the investigation is in tomorrow's possession. This material may be important and your expedited attention to the matter would be appreciated.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a document titled "Analyst's Comments or Conclusions" regarding a "ball lightning" phenomenon. The text discusses various characteristics of the phenomenon, such as its bright blue-or-bluish color, its ability to float slowly above the ground, and its potential to affect moisture-laden ignition components of a motor vehicle. The document is signed by "T. T. Anderson" and dated "3 Jan 1953".

Analyst's Comments or Conclusions:

1. In the opinion section under the data available, the phenomenon was undoubtedly related to the meteorological forces causing lightning discharges. The latter were definitely established through the real thunder-like sounds heard.

2. Probably contributing to the phenomenon were the oil fumes that were being burned in the vicinity, as indicated by the description upon excitation from a "lightning discharge."

3. Interpretation: also the observations of the above-mentioned "ball lightning" display were little different from other related cases described, and the observers verified themselves from the accounts (Dr. John P. Rudolph, Uncle, and Prof. D. Blairs).

4. The agreement, however, of the following, which showed definite, characteristics resembling "ball lightning," can be substantiated:
a. Ball lightning can take many unusual or weird shapes.
b. It is predominantly brilliant blue-or bluish-white in color.
c. It can float slowly some distance above the ground.
d. The close proximity of ball lightning or lightning discharges is capable of setting moisture-laden ignition components of a motor vehicle.

"La Grange, Texasg 
9 Nov 57
Cone, U.S.A.F.

The report on the sighting of the object as observed near Levelland, Texas, on the morning of 2 November 1957 is as follows:

1. No physical evidence in the form of an actual piece of the object sighted. The object was seen by several witnesses but no tangible proof or remains were recovered.
 
2. It appears that ordinary weather conditions prevailed at the time of the sighting, with no adverse meteorological conditions reported. The object was observed by the witnesses under normal visibility and lighting conditions.

3. The object is described as a brilliant, glowing light, approximately the size of an automobile, which appeared to land on or near the highway in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas, at approximately 0300 hours on 2 November 1957. It was reportedly observed by several individuals, some of whom were in motor vehicles which were stalled when the object approached. The object was later reported to have ascended and disappeared from view.

4. Similar reports have been received in the past of objects of this nature in the general area, but no conclusive evidence has been obtained to date to verify the existence of such objects or to determine their origin, nature or purpose.

5. Extensive ground and air searches were conducted in the Levelland area immediately following the reported sighting, but no trace of the object was found and no further sightings were reported."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with extensive text.

"The three glowing and pulsating objects first appeared in the southwestern sky near Levelland, Texas at 9:00 PM, November 2, 1957. They were observed by several persons for approximately 3 - 5 minutes. The objects maneuvered low over the highway, appearing to be about a hundred feet in diameter. As the objects approached, the automobile engines of several witnesses stalled and the headlights went out. When the objects moved away, the engines and lights were restored to normal operation. The objects finally disappeared from view in the southwestern sky. The above account represents a summary of the testimony of the various witnesses interviewed by the Air Force personnel conducting the investigation of this incident."

RE: Prime Source in Levelland UFO Case

There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a scanned newspaper article with the headline "Weird 'Thing' To Be Probed By Air Force" and a detailed article describing a "Sun-Like Mystery Object" that was sighted near atomic bunkers.

Boston Daily Record, tuesday, november 5, 1957: 5
Weird 'Thing' To Be Probed By Air Force  
Washington (AP)- Reports of a huge, mysterious lighted object, shaped like a disc and hovering over a nuclear weapons site have been turned over to the Air Force for investigation, it was disclosed today.   
A bright, orange-yellow object was reported near Levelland, Texas, about 3:00 a.m. Monday. Two women, on guard duty at an atomic installation near there, said the object appeared to be as large as a house and was about 200 feet in the air. They said it cast a bright glow around the area and shone like the sun.  
They said the object remained hovering there for about an hour and 15 minutes, and then went up into the sky at a high rate of speed. Other persons in the vicinity also reported seeing the object.  
There have been numerous similar sightings reported the last few days in the area of Levelland, about 30 miles west of Lubbock, Tex.  
Interviews were made with the two women by representatives of the Tactical Air Command at nearby Reese Air Force base.   
Air Force officials said that the object sighted is apparently the same one that has been reported in many parts of the country in recent weeks. They said a full investigation is under way to determine the nature of the mysterious object.

INQUIRY ON AIR OBJECT
The Air Force is carefully investigating reports that a strange, lighted object was spotted near an atomic weapons site in Texas over the weekend.  
Military and civilian officials at Reese Air Force Base near Levelland, Tex., interviewed eye witnesses who said the object hovered about 200 feet in the air for over an hour early Monday morning.  
The Air Force said it would make every effort to get to the "bottom of this" and determine the nature of the mystery object.

"REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

7 November 1957

PLACE OF INCIDENT: Vicinity Levelland, Texas

DATE & TIME OF INCIDENT: 2 November 1957, approximately 0100 hours

WITNESSES: Several persons in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:

On the night of 2 November 1957, between approximately 0100 and 0115 hours, several persons in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas, reported seeing a large, egg-shaped object land on or near Highway 116. The object was described as being 40 to 60 feet in length and 18 to 20 feet in height, with a bright blue-green light on top. The object was reported to have paralyzed the ignition systems of automobiles in the area.

The first report was received from a Texas Tech student, who stated that as he was driving along Highway 116, his automobile engine stopped and the headlights went out. He reported seeing a large, glowing object land on the road ahead of him. As he approached the object, it rose up and sped away. He was able to restart his automobile after the object had departed.

Other reports were received from individuals in the area, all of whom gave similar descriptions of the object and the effects it had on their vehicles. In several cases, the witnesses stated that the object appeared to follow their automobiles for a distance before departing.

The Air Force conducted an investigation of the incident, but was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object. The case remains unresolved."

LEVELLAND INCIDENT - 2 November 1957 (UNCLASSIFIED)
A. A number of witnesses have described variously an object ranging from round to oval, and predominantly bluish-white in color, moving erratically and described by the witnesses near the Levelland, Texas area from approximately 2300 hours to after 0130 hours, night of 2-3 November 1957. The object appeared to be about 200 feet in length.
B. The unusual behavior or this incident was the witnesses by the observers that their car's ignition stopped completely during encounter.
C. In a matter of hours this incident was given nation-wide publicity. The initial reports by the witnesses gained a great deal of interest and were followed by a flood of UFO reports, the majority of observers confirming the original statements. Statements from impartial witnesses also confirm the reports of the cars stopping, coasting without power, and sweeping down or ricocheting nearby. It was stated that stopped their cars' ignition and lights when the object passed overhead, and that started again shortly after the object had gone. Those insisting that the "blue lights" had stopped their cars claim
that were in the middle of some wider circuit during record day.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing the results of investigations related to "intensive investigations" and information about "lightning or flashes of light". The text discusses details about the investigations, including that the source of the lightning or flashes of light could not be identified by the investigators.

a. Intensive investigations produced information not generally given by such items, and other media previously. For example: certain physical evidence indicating definite objects in the sky were found. Traces of substances, unusual markings, and impressions were found on the ground at points where sightings took place.

b. At the time of certain sightings, a distance and direction from the observer of the lightning or flashes of light. The time source could not be determined by the investigators.

c. After extensive studies and analyses by the Air Force, and other scientific organizations and agencies, it was concluded that the sightings were due to a very rare and undoubtedly natural phenomena or combinations of phenomena, such as the interaction of peculiar and hitherto unknown electrical or electronic field disturbances or associated ionization effects. It was indicated that the electromagnetic reactions and disturbances may have interfered or blanketed normal electrical and electronic systems (in all areas) for a short period during the investigations.

Blinding "Flying Saucer" Stops Texas Motorcars
Levelland, Tex. (UP) - Mysterious objects sighted over this area Friday night and early yesterday morning are reported to have stalled the engines of several automobiles.
James A. Ross, chief deputy sheriff of Abilene, Tex., said he received a report of the sightings in the vicinity of Levelland and plans to send investigators to check the reports.
The object was also reported in the vicinity of Clovis, N.M.
SHERIFF Wier Clem and Deputy Sheriff Pat Naoum, who went out to investigate the reports, said the "most graphic description" they received was from a motorist near Levelland.
The motorist said he was driving along a highway about 70 miles northwest of Levelland when he saw a bright light in the sky. He stopped his car when the object, which he described as a "blinding, brilliant light," came down close to the highway. The object, he said, stalled his motor, and after a few minutes rose straight up and disappeared.
Another motorist, the report said, told a similar story. He said the object "looked like a brilliant star" and that when it came close to his car, his motor "died." He said it remained near his vehicle "for two or three minutes" before shooting straight up and disappearing.

LEVELLAND, Tex., Nov. 4 (AP) — Hunters and other residents near this West Texas town say they saw a bright, egg-shaped object land in a pasture Sunday night.
 The witnesses said the object was about 200 feet long and about 40 feet thick. It lighted up the area for about 40 minutes, then rose with a sound described as a "whooshing" noise and disappeared, they said.
The incident was reported to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, which is studying the report.
The Texas organization which investigated the incident says the object was sighted by several different persons in two separate areas.
One man, who asked that his name not be used, said he was driving near Levelland when his car stopped, apparently because of some unknown influence of the object. He said he was about 300 feet away from the object when it rose and went away.
Another man, who also asked that his name be withheld, said he stopped his car about 500 feet away from the object until it rose and disappeared.

(Dallas, Texas staff and wire reports)
Several cases of fiery oval-shaped objects sighted in far places were recently reported. 
The objects were reported as hovering near the ground for periods ranging from a few minutes to almost an hour before moving straight up and out of sight.
Creditable witnesses include ranchers, businessmen, and a deputy sheriff. 
The sightings occurred in southern New Mexico, first on June 29, 1949 near White Sands and later in July in several locations.
Both sightings were investigated by military and civilian authorities.

The object which came out of the sky appeared bright, at 500 yards was about 50 feet in diameter, was oval in shape, and was larger in the center than on the ends. It was higher in the center than on the ends and flat on the bottom. According to reports, it illuminated the countryside and the men's faces. It passed over the vehicle and the men said that when the object passed over them the engine and headlights of their vehicle went dead. They said that when the object passed, it made no noise. The object took off at a terrific speed, straight up, and disappeared. One of the men said the patrol was about 100 miles an hour heading east when the object appeared and stopped the car.

Bill Ledman said the patrol was about 1 1/2 miles east of Levelland when the incident occurred. He said a heavy rainstorm was in progress at the time with strong winds. He said when the object appeared, the patrol car radio went dead and the engine and lights went out. He said the object was only about 20 to 30 feet off the ground when it passed over them.

Corky Carnes said the patrol was about half a mile east of Levelland when the incident occurred. He said the object appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was traveling at about 500 mph. He said it illuminated the countryside and the men's faces, and when it passed over, the engine and lights went dead. He said the object took off straight up at a terrific speed and disappeared.

Chief Deputy Sheriff Weir Clem said he had interviewed the two men and that they seemed quite sincere. He said they appeared to be sober and not under the influence of anything. He said the men seemed to be telling the truth about what happened. Clem said the men were part of the Levelland Police Department and were traveling east on Highway 116 at the time of the incident.

According to the newspaper report, Oct. 25, the men said they were enroute to Levelland when the incident occurred. They said the object resembled a flaming red goblet, hovering motionless for a few seconds, then taking off at a tremendous speed. They said the object appeared to be about 200 to 300 feet in diameter. This report appeared in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal.

Dr. J. Robert Mosely said that on the night of the object, glowing with a reddish-orange color, the engine and lights of his car went dead as it passed over him. He said the object appeared larger than a car, and it shot up into the sky at a terrific speed. Mosely is head of the West Texas Museum at Texas Technological College in Lubbock.

Weems E. Bowers, said he had investigated the incident and that the two men appeared to be telling the truth. He said it seemed they were unaware of the existence of such a large object in the sky. Bowers said the men reported the object illuminated the countryside and their faces when it passed over them.

Mrs. David L. Patrice, wife of a Levelland resident, said she was driving on the highway at the same time as the two men, and that her engine and lights also went dead as a similar object passed over her car. She said she was about 1 1/2 miles east of Levelland when it happened.

The image appears to be a newspaper article with the headline "Fiery Flying Object Stops Texas Truckers". The article describes an encounter with a mysterious object that was seen by multiple people near Levelland, Texas. It mentions that the object was a bright light that stopped several vehicles and caused engine and lights to fail. The article also states that the object changed color from white to a bluish-green color and eventually disappeared. No photograph is present in this document.

Fiery Flying Object Stops Texas Truckers

Four separate truck drivers, all of whom drove past the spot at different times, told police they saw a mystery object which stopped their trucks dead in their tracks and then took off again. The incident occurred Saturday night near Levelland, Texas.

Levelland police and part-time barber here, told officials the first truck driver, a W.W. Vavallier, 'pulled into a Levelland service station shaking like a leaf' after his lights and engine had failed. He had been driving a tractor-trailer rig.

A fireman, A.J. Fowler, and about 14 others who called in reports of the object confirmed Vavallier's story.

"They seemed to know that all of us saw the same thing. We first saw a flash of light," Fowler said. "When it got near, the lights of my truck went out and my motor stopped. 

"When it passed over, I heard a loud roar and a rush of wind. It was about 200 feet off the ground and about 150 to 200 feet long. It was a brilliant light, one solid flame, and it didn't get close enough for me to see exactly what its shape was."

James Long, a Waxahachie truck driver, gave about the same account. His lights and motor also failed when the object approached.

"The thing was about 200 feet off the ground and as I watched it, the motor of my truck stopped and my lights went out," he said. "When it passed over, there was a brilliant light in the distance but I didn't get close enough for a good look at it."

Robert H. Goode, of Seminole, Texas, said the object he saw was about 200 feet long and he said it appeared to change from a white to a bluish-green color, "like a welding torch, only much larger."

The Air Force also took the unusual step of referring to specific cases. An AP dispatch dated November 5, 1957 reported that this was because "hundreds received". Was the Air Force, perhaps, practicing publicity and preparing the public for what was to come? We might think that the detailed Washington briefing which followed this episode on November 7, which has been described as one of the most highly classified national security matters, may have something to do with this. 

Of the five cases "looked into," one could be promptly dismissed as a hoax (the Schmidt case); Keyhoe summarized Rev. Gill's case as concluded the Air were were either (a) exaggerations, or (b) misunderstood natural phenomena. What about the other three cases discussed?

One car motor and radio was identified as a natural electric phenomenon called "St. Elmo's Fire." Apparently the technical investigators who came to Levelland to investigate were convinced that all the effects could be explained by this phenomenon. But others remain unconvinced that this satisfactory explains all the details. The investigators said that nothing else could be identified. And did anyone's satisfaction examine these phenomena once the light departed? And did anyone's satisfaction examine these phenomena once the light departed? The investigators said that they could find no evidence at the site of anything unusual except the trampled WEEDS; no dents, scorched earth, or other tangible effects, were found to support the claims.

The investigators said further (note that plural) that they could find only three welldefined photographs, and that these three were found to be hoaxes. The article is unclear, but it seems to suggest that the Air Force may have concluded the Levelland incident was an hoax, or at least could not be satisfactorily explained.

THE UNPARALLELED UFO "FLAP" OF NOVEMBER 1957

EGG-SHAPED UFO STALLS CARS ON HIGHWAY
COPS CHASE SKY OBJECT
MYSTERY AIR OBJECT SEEN IN SKY OVER L.A.

These eight-column headlines are only a sample of what appeared all over the national press during the 1957 "Flap" of unidentified flying objects. Many months have passed--two of them artificial (as of this writing)--since the press has displayed much open interest in UPC analysis that they describe

Following hard on the announcement of the launching of "Sputnik"--whether by coincidence or not--there developed into a sharpfocused national interest in UFCs that is still continuing. Several instances of truck drivers, state and local police, and other residents describing seeing a mysterious object that reportedly hovered over highways, stalled car motors and headlights. This effect on automobiles had previously been reported in earlier UPC incidents.

Newsmen, police officers, made a tour of the areas where the object(s) had been encountered. At Levelland, Texas, five automobile drivers and a college student reported close encounters with an object described as bright, egg-shaped and silent as it hovered above their stalled cars. At least seven persons reported close encounters with the bright, silent object in the sky over the highway near Levelland.

Newsmen at least seven other locations where similar encounters were alleged to have occurred. 

The above headlines are from the Albuquerque, N.M. Daily News, 11/5; the Ramo nd, Ind., Times, 11/11; and the Los Angeles Times, 11/6.

Stormy Weather in Texas

The new type of UFO with electromagnetic (E-M) powers first attracted notice in this country by Hasting's appearing near Levelland, Texas, on the night of November 2, 1957. A number of persons reported seeing a large lighted object or small engine near a powerline "as large as a baker's bread pan" (30-foot diameter, 15-20 feet thick; some reports give two objects). The object was about sixty miles from Plainview, site of a famous meteor shower and only twenty-four miles from Lubbock (where a few years earlier had occurred the celebrated Lubbock Lights incident) (80 m.p.h. to 800 m.p.h.).

The region is normally an arid one, but at the beginning of November it was experiencing unusually warm weather - actual storms and rain for several days. About 4:45 that Saturday night, a farmer named Pedro Saucedo (or Saturday) with his friend J. C. Bales Caraveo were returning home from Levelland. A few miles northwest of the town he had turned off Route 116 onto a side road, when both men noticed a brightly lighted object sitting on the road. Saucedo immediately stopped the car, and both men got out and continued observing the object, drawing and talking until suddenly the engine died and the lights went out. While trying to restart the motor, Saucedo (the similarity between "Saucedo" and "saucer" presents a deceiving coincidence) glanced over his left shoulder, something that told him quickly to duck. A veteran of combat in Korea, Saucedo reacted instantaneously as he described it, dropping to the ground. As he downturned, he felt the object strike the car and hit the dirt (because he was afraid I called to Joe but he didn't get out). The thing passed within a few feet of our heads and a rush of wind blew us, he said. I felt a lot of heat."

Crawling out and seeing the object disappear in the direction of Levelland, he restarted the engine and drove back to town to notify the sheriff.

The sheriff was soon receiving reports from other persons who had been driving in the same area at about the same time. They said that they, too, had seen a blazing object which they described as a "ball of fire" sometimes described as "fire-ball". Their stories tallied with Saucedo's, and then repeated one after another, the object had disappeared. A number of townspeople telephoned the authorities to report a bright flash or the lights on their cars and trucks "going out suddenly" - some gave the impression they had near collisions with the object, though no accident had in fact occurred.

Under headlines such as "Mystery Object Stalls Autos in West Texas", these stories hit newspapers all over the nation. The newspaper accounts were not calming. Newspapers in New Mexico were relating that they, too, had seen fiery objects and flashes of light in the sky before An amazingly large number of citizens seem to have been out late that stormy Saturday night, perhaps afraid to go to bed as rumors spread about unusual electric disturbances and the crash that was reported.

For days the Russian satellites had to share the spotlight with the claims that the Russians were actually sending over small pilotless craft to test the American countryside. Some of the accounts were embellished with claims a big light, an egg-shaped object 50 to 60 feet long lighted up as though a landing or takeoff was in progress. Others, like Saucedo's, bluntly described the object as something "torpedo-shaped" "like a rocket, but much larger," and that lights on the object had seemed to be switching on and off [...]]. One look has since been described as a bluish-green glow, and it appeared 30 to 30 feet long. It had a bluish-green glow, and it appeared about 40 to 50 feet long. "It had a bluish-green glow, and it appeared 30 to 50 feet long." Those who wanted to believe in flying saucers easily ignored the discrepancy between the "flaming ball" or "fiery tornado" originally described by Saucedo, and a bluish-green torpedo.

For days the Russian satellites had to share the spotlight with the claims that the Russians were actually sending over small pilotless craft to test the American countryside. Various verifying tests with E-M meters at Levelland were reported. For days newspaper accounts of these bizarre stories insisted that the Institute of Meteorites in New Mexico suggested that the objects seen at Levelland might have been fireballs. A reporter assigned to the story said he would return a report "as soon as I can get back" but no report appeared to confirm the Institute's analysis. 

The writer has asked me to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Stormy Weather in Texas

The new type of UFO with electromagnetic (E-M) powers first attracted notice in this country by Hasting's appearing near Levelland, Texas, on the night of November 2, 1957. A number of persons reported seeing a large lighted object or small engine near a powerline "as large as a baker's bread pan" (30-foot diameter, 15-20 feet thick; some reports give two objects). The object was about sixty miles from Plainview, site of a famous meteor shower and only twenty-four miles from Lubbock (where a few years earlier had occurred the celebrated Lubbock Lights incident) (80 m.p.h. to 800 m.p.h.).

The region is normally an arid one, but at the beginning of November it was experiencing unusually warm weather - actual storms and rain for several days. About 4:45 that Saturday night, a farmer named Pedro Saucedo (or Saturday) with his friend J. C. Bales Caraveo were returning home from Levelland. A few miles northwest of the town he had turned off Route 116 onto a side road, when both men noticed a brightly lighted object sitting on the road. Saucedo immediately stopped the car, and both men got out and continued observing the object, drawing and talking until suddenly the engine died and the lights went out. While trying to restart the motor, Saucedo (the similarity between "Saucedo" and "saucer" presents a deceiving coincidence) glanced over his left shoulder, something that told him quickly to duck. A veteran of combat in Korea, Saucedo reacted instantaneously as he described it, dropping to the ground. As he downturned, he felt the object strike the car and hit the dirt (because he was afraid I called to Joe but he didn't get out). The thing passed within a few feet of our heads and a rush of wind blew us, he said. I felt a lot of heat."

Crawling out and seeing the object disappear in the direction of Levelland, he restarted the engine and drove back to town to notify the sheriff.

The sheriff was soon receiving reports from other persons who had been driving in the same area at about the same time. They said that they, too, had seen a blazing object which they described as a "ball of fire" sometimes described as "fire-ball". Their stories tallied with Saucedo's, and then repeated one after another, the object had disappeared. A number of townspeople telephoned the authorities to report a bright flash or the lights on their cars and trucks "going out suddenly" - some gave the impression they had near collisions with the object, though no accident had in fact occurred.

Under headlines such as "Mystery Object Stalls Autos in West Texas", these stories hit newspapers all over the nation. The newspaper accounts were not calming. Newspapers in New Mexico were relating that they, too, had seen fiery objects and flashes of light in the sky before An amazingly large number of citizens seem to have been out late that stormy Saturday night, perhaps afraid to go to bed as rumors spread about unusual electric disturbances and the crash that was reported.

For days the Russian satellites had to share the spotlight with the claims that the Russians were actually sending over small pilotless craft to test the American countryside. Some of the accounts were embellished with claims a big light, an egg-shaped object 50 to 60 feet long lighted up as though a landing or takeoff was in progress. Others, like Saucedo's, bluntly described the object as something "torpedo-shaped" "like a rocket, but much larger," and that lights on the object had seemed to be switching on and off [...]].

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

After being alerted to the object, several people from the area went to observe it. The object was described as circular in shape, about 200 feet in diameter, and about 30 feet off the ground. It appeared to be resting on a tripod-like landing gear. The object had a glow on the front and back, with a bright light in the center. It remained stationary for approximately 2 hours before slowly rising into the air and moving away at a high rate of speed. No sound was reported from the object. Several witnesses reported the object caused their vehicles to stop, and that all electrical power failed while the object was near. After the object departed, the vehicles were able to restart and the power was restored.

The text of the document is provided below.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 97--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
The Harvard Smithsonian Observations to Cover Moonwatch observations of the new Sputnik gave a sketchy summary of the incident to Dr. Menzel, who concluded that Saucedo might have seen an unusually bright star or satellite, startled by its brilliance, might unintentionally have been killed when he jumped, lacking any real conviction of the story. Asserting that, according to the director of the Harvard College Observatory, the flying saucer were admitted by authorities as a figment, the director then added that so qualified the director that killing the engine was a mere detail.

When the weather conditions at Levelland became known, of course, the meteor theory was immediately discarded by Menzel. Over the years the National Museum in Arizona, made the best guess of all: Saucedo had observed an sample of that rare phenomenon, ball lightning. 

Within a few days an Air Force investigator visited Levelland to study the incident. Menzel of his time, completely convinced that this saucer group had obviously not taken the problem seriously and could not have found the correct solution. Even several hours in the area, he had obviously not taken the problem seriously and could not have found the correct solution.

After studying the weather reports and the descriptions given by various observers and the descriptions given by various observers of other earlier reports, it is obvious that this had a frightening experience, very much as he has been described it in his letter to NICAP addressed to the "Chief of the Air Force Officer". Three persons, not fifteen as had been announced, encountered the ground. Several had not seen it at close quarters but had merely seen brilliant flashes of light in the sky.

After studying the weather reports and the descriptions given by various observers and the descriptions given by various observers of other earlier reports, it is unfortunate that the necessary word further along the phenomenon observed at Levelland had been "ball lightning" or St. Elmo's fire. Supporters of the saucer theory seized on this ambiguity to press the notion, correctly, that their ball lightning and St. Elmo's fire are are quite different phenomena. They were on to conclude by some process of peculiar logic that neither ball lightning nor St. Elmo's fire was involved and that the phenomenon had actually been a flying saucer.

Saucer publications have, however, leads to an overwhelming probability, the fiery unknown at Levelland was ball lightning.

In Levelland the night of November 2 conditions were ideal for the formation of ball lightning. For several days the area had been experiencing freak weather, and on the night in question had been subject to rain, thunderstorms, and lightning. Shortly before the events described in the truck, the two men had noticed a lightning flash in a nearby field. The original description of the phenomenon as "fiery meteors" is thought to have been correct - the truck and its contents were flooded with light and heat - the classic picture of ball lightning. The truck's engine may have died out due to the effects of the lightning. The rain during the encounter could have caused the spark plugs. The feed line may have been closed, cutting of the high voltage ignition. Or the ball lightning may temporarily have deprived the engine of oxygen.

Of the other cases reported that night, some who saw a flashing object like an egg-shaped fireball, these probably saw ball lightning. Others, after hearing Sergeant's frightening story, perhaps unconsciously transmuted what they saw into attacking fiery objects. It is significant that although the night was stormy, the usual lightning that normally accompanies a thunderstorm cannot be preserved as tangible evidence. Its appearance in Levelland on the night of November 2 can never be absolutely proved, even though this explanation fits the facts. The ill facts reveal that in themselves do not constitute a satisfactory solution to so trivial a series of events - a few stalled automobiles, balls of flame in the sky, at the end of thunderstorms - into a natural mystery. (Ball lightning doubtless accounts for other UFO reports, such as the phenomenon observed at Locb Haven on October 24, 1963, when men returning late from a fishing trip saw a fiaming ball hovering above the superstructure of a bridge; it exploded with a loud noise and disappeared.) Anything approaching the appearance of a spaceship over Levelland. Any extraterrestrial vehicle attempting to land or the area that might would certainly have been seen and its path would have been accurately plotted. Monawatch crews in New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado were all watching the skies on the alert, and in Texas itself official observers were on the alert at Big Spring, 150 miles southeast of Levelland, at San Antonio, 275 miles southeast, and at Wichita Falls, 250 miles east. Of the trained witnesses at these stations saw anything in the sky that should not have been there.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

Blinding 'Flying Saucer' 'Stops' Texas Motorcars
Levelland, Tex. Nov. 3 (AP)—About 70 miles northwest of Levelland, a mysterious egg-shaped object was reported by several Texas motorists to have stopped their cars, according to the Levelland police chief.
Texas Highway Patrolmen, too, who said the object first appeared at about 10:50 p.m. They said it hovered over the highway, emitting a 'blinding light.' The object was also reported seen at McCamey, Tex., and Noiwoodery, N.M.
The object was also reported seen in the vicinity of Levelland, and Clovis, N.M.
Several motorists told Levelland police that when the object passed over their cars the motors stopped running and the headlights went out. When the object left, the motors started again.
One Long Islander, J.C. Bren-del of Valley Stream, L.I., who was en route from California to New York, told Levelland authorities that the object passed directly overhead, and that his motor stopped and the lights went out. He said the object was about 200 feet in diameter and appeared to be about 200 feet off the ground. Bren-del also said the thing took off straight up.
Another man, Wallace Chariton, a truck driver from Denver, Colo., told Levelland authorities that the object passed directly over his truck and the lights and motor went dead. He said when the object left, the motor started again.
Other motorists said it did the same thing to their cars.
Levelland Police Chief Ray Slaughter said the object was sighted by several people and was about 200 feet in diameter and about 200 feet off the ground. He said when the thing passed over the cars the motor and lights went out, but came back on again when the object went away.
Levelland Chief of Police Ray Slaughter is convinced that some 'real phenomenon' has been observed in this area. He said that at least a dozen persons have reported seeing the object.
He said it appeared to be a blinding, egg-shaped light which hovered over the highway and stalls the motors and puts out the lights of automobiles passing underneath.
"I have checked the cars of several of these people," Slaughter said, "and the motors run fine now. There is no doubt in my mind that something definite happened here."

II. MILITARISTIC COURSE: According to the information provided, the source claims to have observed an object which he described as a flying object. The source stated that he was driving near Levelland, Texas, when he encountered the object, which he observed for several minutes. The source admitted uncertainty in some of his answers.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that he was driving home from the Levelland, Texas area when he observed a bright light in the sky. The object appeared to be about the size of a car and was hovering above the road. The object then moved across the road in front of the source's automobile, causing his engine and lights to go off. After the object passed, the engine and lights resumed functioning. 

SOURCES described the object as oval-shaped and is thought that the object was emitting some form of radiation or energy. SOURCE stated that the object was about one hundred feet in diameter. (SOURCE declined to estimate the object's distance or height above the ground.)

SOURCE estimated that he had been observing the object for four or five minutes when it rose virtually straight up and out of sight. SOURCE was unable to determine the speed of the object when it departed the area.

Upon the departure of the object, SOURCE stated that the lights and radio of the car operated with no difficulty.

SOURCE stated that there were heavy clouds in the area and a slight rain falling.
SOURCE had no opinion concerning the possible cause of the sighting.

STATEMENT

I was driving home from Lubbock on state highway 116 at approximately 12:30 a.m. and suddenly noticed a very bright light in the sky to the west of me. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it started coming closer and closer, going from west to east, and then it appeared to stop in midair. It was a brilliant blue-white in color and was about twice as big as a car. It seemed to be hovering or standing still in the air, and then started moving in an easterly direction, gathering great speed. In a matter of a few seconds, it had disappeared completely. It was at this time that I saw this object, and I pulled off the highway and tried to start my car, but it would not start. After I had quite a struggle starting it, I finally got it started and continued on my way home. I had no more trouble than under normal circumstances.

I then proceeded to tell my wife about the incident, and she was quite upset over it, but she told me not to say anything to anyone, so I did not. However, I feel that I should report this and did so to the sheriff around 1:30 p.m. Sunday November 3rd.

Occupation: Farmer

SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On November 2, 1957, around 12:10 A.M., SOUROE was driving from Levelland, Texas, to his home approximately three miles south of Levelland, when he observed a bright light which at first appeared to be a car approaching him. As the object came closer, however, SOUROE noted that it was much larger than a car and had no lights on the front or rear. The object, described as pear-shaped and about 40 to 50 feet long, was hovering just above the highway, approximately 15 to 20 feet off the ground. SOUROE stated that the object made him lose control of his vehicle, causing it to stall. He further stated that the object gave off a pulsating glow, and that after hovering for a few minutes, it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. SOUROE reported this incident to the Levelland Police Department, and they notified the Air Force.

CONCLUSIONS: SOUROE's statement that the object caused him to lose control of his vehicle and made it stall indicates the possibility of an electromagnetic effect. The pulsating glow and rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object are also significant factors. The Air Force has not been able to offer a satisfactory explanation for this incident.

At about 4:35 a.m. I was 10 miles south of Levelland, Texas, and I saw a bright light come down from the sky. It seemed to hover over the highway and then shot up into the sky and disappeared. I stopped my truck, got out, and took a look, but it was so rapid and quick that I could not make out what it was.

STATEMENT

While driving north about 7 miles north of Levelland, Texas, I saw a light about the size of a basketball about 300 or more feet above ground traveling from east to west. The light was moving slowly and silently. It appeared to be about 3 miles distant. It was much about a 1 mile distance. No sound was heard while getting closer and the balloon object above it. It continued moving north to about 3 or 4 minutes.   And then the bright object above it disappeared as it went behind some trees.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: ATSS
RCS: AL/l'E-65-331-587

CONTENTS OF THE FOLLOWING MATTER

This report contains the following comments concerning the descriptions, reliability, etc., of the subject incident. The observers are civilians (Part I) and an airline pilot (Part II).

Part I: The observers were watchmen on duty (Part I) and an airline pilot (Part II). They were traveling along the highway near Levelland, Texas, when they observed a large, brightly illuminated object hovering over the highway. The object was glowing and seemed to be surrounded by a halo or ring of light. As the observers approached the object, their car engine and lights failed. A short time later the engine and lights returned to normal operation. An examination of the car revealed no apparent mechanical damage. Thereafter, other similar incidents were reported in the same general area. No complete explanation has been found for this phenomenon.

Related with the above, the following additional details are noted:

Weather: There were no clouds. The object was observed to be hovering above the highway. No trail or exhaust was visible.

Reaction of Observers: According to the observers, their car engine and lights failed as the object approached. After the object moved away, the engine and lights resumed normal operation. No damage to the car was found.

Significance of this Report: This observer's account describes a rather striking incident which appears to be similar to other incidents reported from the same general area. While the cause of the phenomenon has not been satisfactorily explained, the fact that several apparently reliable observers have reported similar experiences suggests that the incident may be significant and worth further investigation. The ability of the object to paralyze the operation of an automobile engine and lights is of particular interest and may indicate the presence of some unusual field effect. Thorough on-the-spot investigation of any future similar incidents would be highly desirable.

Transcribing the text from the document:

LEVELLAND INCIDENT 2 November 1957 (UNCLASSIFIED)

a. A LEVELLAND, TEXAS, incident, whose nature was described variously as "landing," "sighting," and "disappearance," occurred approximately 23:00 hours to after 01:30 hours, night of 2-3 November 1957. Reports indicate a light of unusual nature descended on the highway, stopping cars, affecting ignition systems, and keeping several drivers helpless for a period.

b. The unusual aspect of this incident was the statement by a number of observers that their car's electrical systems were completely during the occurrence.

c. In addition to those this incident was given nation-wide publicity by the nation's press, radio and TV networks, for the following reasons:

1) Several individuals, in different locations, claimed to have encountered a dazzling light or lights, generally oval in shape, which descended to the highway and appeared to land or hover near the automobiles. 

2) The observers stated that when the light or lights approached, the ignition systems of their cars were affected, and the engines stopped.

3) The reports indicate that the cars were disabled for a period of time, ranging from a few minutes to over an hour, and in some instances, the cars could not be restarted until the object had departed the area. 

4) Intensive investigations were conducted by the Air Force, and the incidents were the subject of wide-spread publicity and conjecture. However, no definite conclusions were reached as to the nature of the phenomenon.

d. After investigations and analysis by the Air Force, and in full collaboration with outside specialists and scientists, the conclusion has been reached that the incidents were caused by natural phenomena, and were not the result of the intrusion of unconventional, unidentified aerial vehicles.

The text of the document is as follows:

1. LEVELLAND REPORT 2 November 1957 (UNCLASSIFIED)
a. A series of observations were made, those shapes were described variously as ranging from round to oval, and was luminous, white-in-color, in color, in several instances, and estimated to be 40-50 feet in length. This object was first observed from 2300 hours to after 0130 hours, 3 November 1957. The size of the object was estimated from that of a basketball to that of an object 200 feet in length.
b. The unusual incident of this incident was the statement by a number of observers that their car's ignition stopped completely during the observation.
c. In a matter of hours this incident was given nation-wide publicity by the nation's press, radio and TV networks. For the next 72 hours, ATIC and Headquarters USAF were deluged with a flood of UFO reports, which added to their normal case load in an manner not clearly understood, claiming to have encountered a somewhat similar phenomena.
d. Extensive investigations conducted by the Air Force revealed that while there were some reports of a "blue light" described as having stopped in the sky, the reports were from persons of varying degrees of reliability, and that the "blue light" as described, was not proven to be a single definable object. The reports were from persons of varying reliability, and the "blue light" as described, was not proven to be a single definable object. The reports were characterized as possibly containing some standing in their own right, however, supporting the object to these incidents, insisting that the "blue light" stopped their car engines. Other reports of similar phenomena were found to be generally unreliable.
e. Extensive investigating procedures immediately after the incident revealed that the object, variously described, had no apparent recognizable explanation. It was pitch dark, rain and wind was falling, a very low ceiling existed, light conditions were extremely poor and the sightings took place in a very isolated area. Based on interviews and statements obtained from witnesses, it appeared that the sightings represented honest attempts to describe what was actually observed, though not all reports could be considered reliable, particularly in view of the poor light conditions during the investigations.
f. After extensive studies and analyses by the Air Force, and in full collaboration with outside scientists and experts, it appears reasonable to conclude that the lighted object seen on the road near Levelland was the result of a relatively rare atmospheric phenomenon, possibly electrostatic, which could account for the reported effects on the automobile ignition systems. (All agreed that the combination of conditions existing at the time were definitely conducive to the formation of some type of atmospheric electrical disturbance, and that this was the most probable explanation further confirmed the conclusion.)
