10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
This case triggered off more than 300
similar investigations. Publicity was wide public interest and sensationalism given by the press. This and the TV, Oral, and found shaped object, generally bluish-white or greenish-white in color.

The size and maneuvers of the obj varied with the length of observation. Ball to 300 feet in length; although the majority report being 100 to 200 ft, hover above the ground. Most of the observers stated that the obj affected car ignitions and headlights.

11. COMMENTS
After very extensive checks and detailed investigations by the Air Force and with complete cooperation with both Air Force & non-government scientists it was concluded that the sighting was due to a very rare phenomena, ball lightning.

LEVELLAND, TEXAS "BLUE LIGHT" CASE
2 November 1957

Five witnesses report seeing objects in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas on the night of 2 November 1957. The time reported by these witnesses is between 2300 and 2400 hours. The general description of the UFO's is that they were round to oval in shape and ranged from the size of a baseball to a basketball. The colors reported were white with a greenish tint, blue, reddish color, and a flash of white light. Several of the witnesses reported that the engine of their car died due to electrical disturbances. The duration of most of these sightings was approximately several seconds.

At 2045 on 4 November 1957, a witness reported an UFO as red and the size of a basketball. Considered to a larger or object by what appeared to be a cable. After approximately three or four minutes the object rose and disappeared into the base of the clouds.

The weather at the time of the sightings on 2 November 1957, was a 4,000' overcast, visibility three miles, light and variable. There was a drizzle or light rain throughout the period and the area had been subjected to heavy thunderstorms just prior to the sightings. The weather on the 4th of November 1957, thick heavy clouds and light rain.

It is concluded that the cause of the sightings on 2 November 1957, was probably due to a phenomena known as "Ball Lightning". The cause for the sightings on 4 November 1957, could be attributed to the sudden disposition of moisture on distributor parts, especially if moisture condensation nuclei were enhanced by increased atmospheric ionization. In one instance a faulty distributor was determined as being the cause for the motor stoppage.

The object sighted on 4 November 1957, was probably a weather balloon with the safety light which is attached to these balloons for night launchings.

SUBJ: Request for Air Science Division Review of Levelland Case

ball lightning can hover above the ground, and blue-white light (the color most reported) is a characteristic color. (See brief excerpt from an authoritative source from research done on the subject.)

4. Request that applicable personnel of Air Sciences Division, in collaboration with other ATIC units necessary, determine or give their viewpoints in regard to the following "missing factor" or hypothesis:

a. What effect does nearby lightning discharges have on the electrical circuits, or voltage potential?
b. Could oil vapor (from thenearly oil fields) suspended in the water droplets in the air be ignited to cause an explosion, or a ball of light somewhat similar to a flash-bulb light? Mist, heavy clouds and a very low ceiling at that time.

5. Formal request in writing is made because the case file will undoubtedly be sent to Washington and/or turned over to the TV group, tomorrow.

6. To satisfy both the demands of Headquarters USAF, and to possibly incorporate this in the material required by the aforementioned writers and story researchers due in tomorrow, your cooperation in this matter would be appreciated.

Analysis: Comments or Conclusions:
"Ball Lightning" -

1. In the opinion of the undersigned, after careful search, study, and consideration of all data available, the phenomenon was undoubtedly related to the meteorological conditions that existed in the area at that time; fog, light rain, mist, very low ceiling, (400 feet) and lightning discharges. The latter were definitely established through the results of numerous investigative reports.

2. Probably contributing to the phenomenon were the oil fires that were also burning in the vicinity. An oil-saturated mist is capable of producing a "fluorescent glow" (as demonstrated) upon excitation from a lightning discharge.

3. In summation, all of the above were conducive to a "ball lightning" manifestation -- a field, of which very little is known by and of written authorities themselves (Dr. John Trombridge, Enclog. Am.; Prof. T. A. Blair, Univ. of Nebraska, Weather Elements, among others).

4. All are in agreement, however, of the following, which, significantly, are the almost exact characteristics and descriptions of the "Levelland phenomena":

a. Ball lightning can take many unusual or weird spherical or elliptical shapes.

b. It is predominantly brilliant blue-or bluish-white in color.

c. It can float slowly some distance above the ground.

5. The close proximity of ball lightning or lightning discharges is capable of ionizing the air in such a way that may, in turn, effect moisture-laden ignition components of a motor vehicle.

to have existed during several of the sightings
might have had a brilliant reflections from
some of the cloud formations. This might account
for the cloud reflections (or some other
of the cloud fire (must discharge appearance)
might have been seen in a case or two, but
not necessarily still "sighting" can spite of
occasional reference to little lighting in reportedly
sightings. Particularly where ordinary lighting

b. Exceedingly unlikely. (There is a very low

BOSTON DAILY RECORD, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1957

Weird Thing
To Be Probed
By Air Force

WASHINGTON (AP)—Reports of a huge, strangely lighted mystery object spotted over West Texas were being investigated today by the Air Force. A bright, oval object was also reported including a sheriff and other witnesses.

Although reports were conflicting, the object over Texas, sighted by several persons, was said to be sufficiently unusual to call for at least a preliminary investigation.

21 HOURS AWARE

Watching or fly-object over the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico were made 17 hours apart by two military patrols. One patrol spotted the object near bunkers used in the first atomic bomb explosion.

One of the two-man patrols said the bright object appeared about 2 a.m. Sunday or 300 feet long and disappeared in the sky after blinking on and off several times. The mystery object spotted early Sunday morning descended until it was near bunkers, then faded "like a bomb."

Officials of the proving ground said the phenomena had nothing to do with any activity at the proving ground, and so far no official report was received on the reported New Mexico sightings.

ENGINEERS STOPPED

Witnesses who reported seeing the object over Texas said their lights went out and their car engine failed. Two Army lieutenants have reported the sighting, and the Air Force and civilian scientists are investigating.

It was not immediately clear whether there was any connection between the phenomena reported widely over the large scale power failures like those which hit the Grand Central area in New York City last week.

Sun-Like Mystery Object
Hovers Near Atomic Bunkers

WHITE SANDS, N.M., Nov. 4 (AP)—The Army today reported that a huge, weird object "nearly as large as the sun" was spotted Sunday hovering near bunkers used in the first atomic bomb explosion.

The sightings were made 17 hours apart by two military police patrols at the southern end of the proving ground. One patrol said the object was about 300 feet long.

One of the two-man patrols said the bright object appeared about 2 a.m. Sunday or 300 feet long and disappeared in the sky after blinking on and off several times. The mystery object spotted early Sunday morning descended until it was near bunkers, then faded "like a bomb."

Officials of the proving ground said the phenomena had nothing to do with any activity at the proving ground.

INQUIRY ON AIR OBJECT
Air Force Looking Into Reports
of Texas Occurrence

WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (AP)—
The Air Force began an investigation today of a lighted object reported over West Texas Saturday and yesterday.

Variety of flying objects have been occurring for years, but this one had the support of several witnesses, including two of his deputies, who said the object was a burning mass, a big light and an egg-shaped object 250 feet long.

HONOLULU, Nov. 4 (UP)—The Fiji government has a report—clergymen and four natives reportedly sighting a "flaming object" which, according to a description, generally matched the description of an unidentified object reported last week.

The text is from the Boston Daily Record, dated Tuesday, November 5, 1957, and discusses reports of a mysterious flying object near White Sands and in Texas, which the Air Force was investigating.

General Comments by hypothesis.

There is just enough truth in this hypothesis (the existence of charged clouds and of course lightning) to make it appear as a reasonable explanation.

However, we have never heard of the "ducting" of ions, and certainly if a single volume of air were to be heated, the resulting effect of gases would develop quite a wind, which signs of the incident did not indicate.

On November 3, 1957 a rash of sightings broke out in Texas and they had a brand new twist. To do things up right the power that guide the UFO picked the town of Levelland only 17 miles west of Lubbock, the home of the new traditional "Lubbock Lights".

It was with a tug of nostalgia that I read about these reports because five years before, almost to the day, Lubbock had plunged the Air Force, and me, into the UFO mystery on a grand scale.

According to the best interpretation of the mass of conflicting stories, facts and rumors about these famous sightings, the only positive fact is that there were scattered storm clouds across West Texas on the night of November 4, 1957. Gulf war.

1. LEVELLAND INCIDENT - 2 November 1957 (UNCLASSIFIED)

a. A mysterious object, whose shape was described variously as ranging from round to oval, and predominately bluish-white in color was observed expertly by six persons near the town of Levelland, Texas. Times of observations ranged from 2300 hours to after 0130 hours, night of 2-3 November 1957. Site of the object was estimated from that of a basketball to that of an object 200 feet in length.

b. The unusual aspect of this incident was the statement by a number of observers that their car's ignition stopped completely during the occurrence.

c. In a matter of hours this incident was given nation-wide publicity by the nation's news, radio and TV networks. For the next 72 hours ATIC and Headquarters USAF were deluged with a flood of UFO reports, the majority of observers claiming to have encountered a seemingly similar phenomenon: a dazzling bluish-white object, generally oval in shape, extending down or floating nearby - that abruptly stopped car's ignition. The reports were from persons of some standing in their communities casually reporting seeing the object to those insisting that the "blue lights" stopped their cars in heavy traffic in the middle of large cities during broad daylight.


- page 29 -

d. Intensive investigations produced information not generally given by newspapers and other media previously. For example: it was pitch dark, rain and mist was falling, a very low ceiling existed. Share more information disclosed, and the sightings took place near an area where excess gases from oil operations were being burned. In some instances, faulty ignition systems and near freezing temperatures were found during the investigations.

e. A number of the observers interviewed admitted the presence of lightning on flashes of light. The zone could not be located for interviews and interrogations by USAF investigator.

f. After exhaustive studies and analyses by the Air Force, and in full collaboration with outside scientists and experts, it was concluded that the sighting was due to a very rare lightning phenomenon - ball lightning. No definite conclusion has been reached regarding the possible effects of ball lightning on ignition systems. (All agreed that the combination of conditions existing in the zone were definitely conducive to the phenomenon. A study of the very few existing photographs of actual ball lightning further confirmed the conclusion.)

Blinding 'Flying Saucer' 'Stops' Texas Motorcars

Levelland, Tex. (UP) — A mysterious egg-shaped object and a blinding getting out sound, faster than the speed of sound, streaked over West Texas and New Mexico Saturday night and early yesterday, and one man said he even saw it sitting in the highway.

James A. Lee of Abilene, Tex., who is a member of the National Investigations Committee, rushed here to investigate and said he will send a report to Washington.

The object was also reported seen in the vicinities of Midland, Tex., 110 miles south of Levelland, and Clovis, N.M., about 70 miles northwest of Levelland.

THE MOST graphic description came from Jesse D. Long of Waco, Tex., who said the object killed the engine of his automobile and put out his headlights.

Other motorists said it did the same thing to their cars.

Long said the object appeared to be about 200 feet long and landed in the highway in front of his car. When he got out to investigate the thing took off straight up.

SHERIFF Weir Clem and Deputy Sheriff Pat McCullough, who went out to investigate the reports, said they spotted the object streaking across the sky in front of their cars.

"It lit up the whole pavement in front of us for about two seconds," said Clem. He called it a very shaped and said it looked like a brilliant red sunset.

Thoroughly impressed, Long said reports that automobiles went out convinced him a flying object definitely had visited the area.

He said machines inside the object "disturb the magnetic field of balance" and will cause car engines to stall and compasses to go awry.

LEE SAID he definitely did not think the object was launched by the United States. Pedro Saciolo, a Levelland farmer, made the first airport sighting of the thing. He said he was driving west of Levelland on State Highway 116 about 11:15 p.m. (CST) Saturday, when it flashed over him with a terrific noise.

"It sounded like an ear-splitting clap of thunder," Saciolo told the sheriff. He said it killed his engine and knocked out his headlights until after it passed over.

JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT, TRUCK DRIVER WAS DRIVING TOWARD TOWN WITH A PASSENGER WHEN A HUGE TORPEDO-SHAPED OBJECT DESCENDED TOWARD THE HIGHWAY. IT HAD A BLUISH-GREEN GLOW, AND IT APPEARED TO BE 150 TO 200 FEET LONG.

AS THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT CAME CLOSER, THE CAR LIGHTS DIMMED, THEN THE ENGINE SPUTTERED AND DIED. JUMPED OUT AND DIVED UNDER THE TRUCK. AS WATCHED FROM THE CAB, THE STRANGE OBJECT SETTLED CLOSE TO THE ROAD. WHETHER IT LANDED, OR WAS HOVERING JUST OFF THE GROUND, COULD NOT TELL.

THE BLUE-GREEN LIGHT WAS TOO BRIGHT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES THE UFO REMAINED THERE, THEN IT QUICKLY LIFTED.

Texans See 'Craft From Outer Space'
By the United Press

LEVELLAND, Tex., Nov. 4. — A man who has spent 20 minutes studying a mysterious object said today he believed West Texas and New Mexico was a space craft from one of the neighboring planets.

"The expert is James A. Lee, of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization and a director of Interplanetary Space Patrol. A West Texas investigator who made first-hand investigations "flying saucers" and similar objects.

Mr. Lee rushed here yesterday upon hearing of the latest object, seen by at least nine persons in two states.

The egg-shaped object was described as about 200 feet long and a brilliant red.

James D. Long, of Waco, said he was driving near Levelland yesterday when he encountered the object sitting in out of his car 200 feet away to investigate, but that, when he did, the object suddenly rose off with a roar straight up.

Mr. Long said his engine coughed and died and his headlights suddenly went out.

Two other persons in the Levelland area said the object passed over their cars with a loud roar, the engines died and the headlights went out, too.

Sheriff Weir Clem and his deputy, Pat McCullough, spotted the object in the sky in front of their car. "It lit up the whole pavement in front of us for about two seconds," Mr. Clem said.

Fiery Ovals
Sighted in
Far Places
(From Dallas News Staff and
Wire Reports)

Flying fireballs, the hopped-up
high-velocity version of the old-time spinning saucers, Monday night were
reported at such widely separated
points as Foster, Tex., and the
Fiji Islands.

Now, the Air Force announcing it is sending a team of technicians to
investigate the glowing, mysterious object spotted at Levelland,
Texas, Saturday night and early
Sunday, also disclosed that sightings began to mount.

And at least one student of flying saucers, who completed his
personal investigation of the Levelland affair Monday, said he was
firmly convinced that the object
there was a space craft
from one of the neighboring
planets.

At White Sands Proving Ground,
N.M., the Army reported that a
"bright, fiery object resembling
the sun" was spotted Sunday
hovering near bunkers used in
the first A-bomb explosion.

The sightings at White Sands
were made by different military police units patrolling the missile testing range
in Southern New Mexico. First
Lt. Allen R. Penny of Fort Jers
headquarters said none of
the military police, said none of
the men had heard radio reports
or seen newspaper accounts of
similar sightings elsewhere in the
country.

Both sightings were in the area
of the new abandoned bunkers
used by technicians who observed
the world's first atomic explosion
on land.

Lieutenant Penny, whose base,
Stallion Site Camp, is about
90 miles north of the proving
grounds headquarters, said the
first sighting there was made at
6 a.m. Sunday by Cpl. Glenn H.
Toy as egg-shaped and 75 to
100 yards in diameter, then descended until it was about 50
yards above the bunkers.

It went out. A moment later it began rising. Page 3, Col. 1

came real bright, like the sun, then it would go out and w. out.

The second sighting was made at 5 p.m. Sunday by S.P.3. Bartow, Tex., who was near the church official, R. O. Venter church official, R. O. Aveling, and four natives had sighted a dazzling object in the South Pacific skies.

The report, issued Oct. 23 in Santa, capital of the island group, gave details of the sighting of the strange flying object were reported the preceding week.

All the witnesses there described what they had seen as a "strange flying object" about 30 feet in shape. "They said it gave off a blinding light" and made them feel weak.

But it was the Levelland incident, apparently set off the wave of reports, and a Texan experienced in tracking flying saucers was certain that the object seen there was a visitor from another world.

"Whatever this thing was it had a definite mission and a plan of operation," James A. Lee of Abeline told The News. Lee, who is a former Air Force employe and a household ware store manager, said he was interested in space mysteries for a decade or more. He rushed to Levelland to interview witnesses with the several persons who said they had seen the huge, brightly lighted object.

After on the ground or in the air, Lee said, "Those people told their story." He said, "Those witnesses separately and their messages separately and their stories all added up."

The sheriff (Weir Clem of Levelland) told me personally that when the object was sighted, they came in and none of them knew what the others had said. They all told the same story.

The story, as related by Sheriff Clem and others, was egg-shaped and about 200 feet long, settled down on highways at points around Levelland, and in some cases went dead and their headlights went out. When the object rose swiftly into the air, the car lights came back on, and the drivers were able to continue on.

Finding nothing wrong, he closed the hood. As he did so he caught in "right reported in made a tightened dash to get back into the car. As he did so, the fly-ing object was gone.

The report said the object was visible to start his car again.

The dead engine area principally impressed Donald E. Keyhoe, noted writer and former Marine Corps intelligence officer, who has written several books attempting to prove that flying saucers are, too, real.

"That's just the way an electronic device failed would explain it," he said.

Lee said that he wanted to get a first-hand report from the matter. Lee is a member of Keyhoe's committee and is also a director of Interplanetary Space Research, a group of space researchers over most of Texas.

Some witnesses described the brilliant light moving slowly a short distance above the surface of the ground, with no visible support a few feet high.

Not a chance, said Lee.

"Whatever it was showed every indication of being under intelligent control," he said. "Its objective seemed to be to halt traffic, then immediately leave that area and fly over to another highway leading into Levelland, then land for some time, and when the lights went out, another location. In every case when a car or truck would stop, the lights would go out and the car would fail to function."

The possibility that a culture might have been caused by electrical interference or static electricity was suggested by Dr. Wayne Rut ledge, associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Texas, in an interview with The News.

"You might build up enough conductivity in the air as the result of dust to cause the ignition of a clap of thunder, as it landed that there."

Some witnesses reported the object made a deafening noise, like a clap of thunder, as it landed.

Wright told Lee that "we can't be unaccountable, his end of it."

Fiery Flying Object Stops Texas Trucks

LEVELLAND, Tex. —(R)— Reports of a mystery object which came with a "great sound and rush of wind" had officials and the public puzzled today.

Newsmen and authorities had reports of sightings over a wide area of Texas area Saturday and early today.

Peace officers checking areas where landings were reported were unable to find any traces.

Rense Ale Force Base officials said an investigation was being made.

Pedro Saucedo, 30, a farm hand and part-time barber here, told officers and newsmen, "I was driving out to a farm near the Pettit community (west of here) Saturday night with a friend, Joe Salaz, when we first saw the thing. We first saw a flash of light in a field to our right and we didn't think much about it at first.

"When it got near, the lights of my truck went out and the motor died. I jumped out of the truck and hit the dirt because I was afraid. I called to Joe but he didn't get out. Then I got up and looked around. I saw a great sound and a rush of wind. It sounded like thunder and my truck rocked from the blast. I felt a lot of heat. Then I got up and watched it go out of sight toward Levelland," he said.

Saucedo, a Korean War veteran, said it was "torpedo shaped" or "like a rocket," but much larger.

Ronald Martin, 18, a Levelland truck driver, said his truck engine died and the lights went out "when a big ball of fire dropped on the highway" east of here early Sunday. Martin said the object changed colors when it settled on the highway, then charged to a fireball again when it rose straight up and disappeared.

Sheriff Weir Glen said he saw a brilliant light in the distance but didn't get close enough for a good look. Highway Patrolman Lee Hargrove and Floyd Cavin reported seeing similar flashes in the sky in about the same area and at the same time as Glen. All were riding in separate cars.

Police Patrolman A. J. Fowler and Saucedo and about 14 others said the object was 200 feet long, shaped like an egg and was 10 to 15 feet up like it was on fire—but looked more like neon lights.

"They seemed to agree that the something was 200 feet long, shaped like an egg and was 10 to 15 feet up like it was on fire—but looked very excited," he asserted.

The Air Force also took the unusual step of referring to specific cases. An AP dispatch from Washington (Nov. 15) began: "The Air Force has looked into five recent reports ... and there isn't a flying saucer in the lot." Five reports out of scores or hundreds received? Was the Air Force, perhaps, practicing frugality? We might think so, in the light of another Washington dispatch (Science Service, Nov. 7), which said: "Each major track-down costs about $10,000, including sending out investigating personnel, paying transportation expenses, sending planes aloft to investigate intruders and taking pictures of, perhaps, Venus - plus administrative work." But on this point there is some instructive evidence (see below)

Of the five cases "looked into," one could be promptly dismissed as a hoax (the Schmidt case, Kearney, Nebraska, Nov. 5). The other four cases, concluded the AF, were either (a) exaggerations, or (b) misunderstood natural phenomena. What about these natural phenomena?

At Levelland, Texas, the luminous egg-shaped object 200-300 feet long that stopped car motors, and radios was identified as "a natural electronic phenomenon called ball lightning or St. Elmo's fire." Apparently the technical investigators who conducted this particular $10,000 investigation were not aware that these are relatively different: electric phenomena; or that the average diameter of ball lightning is 8 inches; or that a good many scientists deny that ball lightning even exists; or that St. Elmo's fire is invariably attached to some solid object. As for the stalled car motors, continued the AF, the same weather that produced St. Elmo's ball lighting might have - MIGHT have, notice - "soaked the ignition systems of cars." And what might have dried them out so quickly once the light departed? And did anyone's ignition in fact become soaked? (One report, said the AF, arose from "an automobile mechanic's mistake"; no details are given.)

The investigators said further (note that plural) that they could find only three witnesses who actually saw the big light. The miracle is, they found as many as three. On November 6 the Levelland, Daily Sun News reported: "Air Force 'Mystery' Man Leaves City, Actions, Identity Cloaked in Secrecy." The anonymous visitor drove an AF vehicle, wore civilian clothes, and "asked he could not give his name or any identification" (italics ours). Around noon on the 6th he spent 30 minutes in Sheriff Clem, was never any hint of a network about C-30 p.m. (on another half hour, about 3 p.m. he headed for Lubbock (30 miles away); he came back about 6:30, said to Sheriff Clem, "Well, I'm gone," and drove off into the dark, drippy night. Adds the paper, "There was never any hint he was really a civilian or an Air Force officer."

Does the Air Force call this a "major track-down"? We won't even bother to laugh. Do they say that the activities of the mysterious gentleman's 7-hour day cost $10,000 or anything like it? Then the taxpayers had better start yelling bloody murder. For they are being well bilked. Yet it was on the basis of this feeble parody of an investigation that the Air Force, on November 15, uttered its "conclusions" about the Levelland object.

SUBJECT: Appreciation

Commander
1006th Air Intelligence Service Squadron
Ft Air Force Base, Colorado

1. This organization wishes to express its appreciation to the 1006th Air Intelligence Service Squadron for the fine support rendered in conjunction with investigations of unidentified aerial phenomena.

2. The summer of 1947 marked the beginning of active United States Air Force interest in the so-called "flying saucer" business. Since that time literally thousands of reports have been received, investigated, evaluated and documented. This tremendous task would never have been accomplished without the whole-hearted and energetic support of your organization.

3. It is always extremely difficult to isolate those individuals who have contributed most toward the success of any supporting program. Such is the case here. We do recall, however, that S/Sgt Norman P. Ritch, of your organization, has been in intimately close contact with our people regarding field investigations, and personally did an extremely fine job for us during the recent Levelland, Texas incident. Enclosure No. 1.

4. It is my desire that you extend to S/Sgt Harth and other responsible members of your command, our sincere appreciation for their unifying efforts and loyal support.

STATEMENT OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

S/Sgt BARTH, Norman P.

1. On 2 November 1957, the Air Technical Intelligence Center was notified of an unidentified flying object, which was reported in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas. The impact of this sightings on the public can only be measured in terms of the publicity given the incident, and the great increase in reported cases of unidentified flying objects. Apparently six hundred cases were reported in a three week period following this incident.

2. S/Sgt Barth, of the 1006th Air Intelligence Service Squadron, was assigned the task of investigating the Levelland report. Investigation was made in this incident through S/Sgt Barth, who traveled through a forceful but also required that he be diplomatic in his dealings with the witnesses and other persons concerned with the sighting. The information supplied the Air Technical Intelligence Center by S/Sgt Barth was considered complete in every detail and reflected the thoroughness of this man in the performance of his duty. As a result of S/Sgt Barth's efforts the Air Technical Intelligence was able to keep the Air Force and other interested government agencies informed concerning this important sighting. This airman's handling of this controversial incident reflects great credit upon himself and his organization.

3. Air Force Regulation 200-2, dated 5 February 1953, is the Air Force guide pertaining to unidentified flying objects. S/Sgt Barth was the organizational representative at the Air Technical Intelligence Center in December 1957. This airman made many valuable contributions to the draft of the regulation.

THE UNPARALLELED UFO "FLAP" OF NOVEMBER 1957

EGG-SHAPED UFO STALLS CARS ON HIGHWAY

MYSTERY AIR OBJECTS SEEN IN SKY OVER L.A.

These eight-column headlines are only a sample of what appeared all over the national press during the first two weeks of November, 1957. Many moons passed—two of them artificial (as of this writing)—since the press has displayed such open interest in UFOs, but then the remarkable incidents which they describe are undoubtedly without parallel in the history of "flying saucers."

Following hard on the announcement of the launching of "Sputnik"—whether by coincidence or not—came the first reports of what quickly developed into a startling series: near Levelland, Texas, during the night of November 2/3rd, a number of truck drivers, state and local police, and other residents described seeing a vast 200-foot, luminous "egg-shaped" object that hedgehopped around Levelland, landing on highways and in adjacent fields and mysteriously affecting car motors and headlights. (This effect on automobiles had previously been reported from France, in 1954.) Terrified witnesses reported their experiences to Vern Clem, Hockley County Sheriff, and Clem, together with deputies and dozens of police officers, made a tour of the areas where the object(s) had been encountered. At 2:30 a.m., he saw "a streak of fire!" "Clash across the highway to the south of his cars; two highway patrolmen, following some distance behind him, confirmed his sighting. At least seven persons reported close encounters with the "egg"; at least four cars or trucks were stalled; and many others reported seeing the phenomenon at greater distance.

* The above headlines are from the Alamogordo, N.M., Daily News, 11/5; the Hammond, Ind. Times, 11/11; and the Los Angeles Times, 11/6.

Stormy Weather in Texas

The new type of UFO with electromagnetic (E-M) powers first attracted notice in this country by allegedly appearing near Level-land, Texas, on the night of November 2, 1957, a few hours before Sputnik II went into orbit. A small town with a population of some 800, Levelland lies on the plains of western Texas about sixty miles from Plainview, site of a famous meteor shower and only twenty-five miles from Lubbock, which a few years earlier had gained national fame with its "Lubbock lights" (p. 000). The region is normally an arid one, but at the beginning of November it was experiencing unusual weather—electrical storms and rain (the month proved to be the wettest Saturday recorded in western Texas).

About 11:15 that Saturday night, a farmworker named Pedro Saucedo (or Saucido) with his friend Joe Palaz (also given in various printed accounts as Palav, Salaz, Salvaz) was driving home from Levelland. A few miles northwest of the town he had turned off Route 116 into a side road, when both men noticed a flash of light in a field at the right. Evidently unalarmed, he continued driving and talking until suddenly the engine died and the lights went out. While trying to restart the motor, Saucedo (the similarity between "Saucedo" and "saucer" presents a diverting coincidence) glimpsed over his left shoulder something that looked like a flaming ball or a fiery tornado drifting rapidly toward the truck. A veteran of combat in Korea, Saucedo reacted instantaneously to the blazing unknown. As he described the experience later that night, "I jumped out of the truck and hit the dirt because I was afraid. I called to Joe but he didn't get out. The thing passed directly over my truck with a great sound and a rush of wind. It sounded like thunder and my truck rocked from the flash. . . . I felt a lot of heat." Crawling out and seeing the object disappear in the direction of Levelland, he restarted the engine and drove back to Levelland to report the incident to the sheriff [etc.].

The sheriff was soon receiving reports from other persons who had been driving in the same area at about the same time. They said that they, too, had seen a blazing object which they described as a "flying egg" or "egg-shaped fireball". Their cars, like Saucedo's, had stalled and then restarted when the object disappeared. A number of townspeople telephoned the authorities to report bright flashes in the sky, and the police comment that "everyone who called was very excited" [3] was probably an understatement.

Under headlines such as "Mystery Object Stalls Autos in West Texas," these stories hit newspapers all over the nation. The news spread fast. All day Sunday dozens of persons in Texas and New Mexico were relating that they, too, had seen fiery objects and flashes of light in the sky the night before. An amazingly large number of citizens seem to have been out late that stormy Saturday night, but apparently none of them noticed any ordinary lightning—only phantom "somethings" variously described as a burning mass, a "big light," an egg-shaped object seen feet long lighted up as though it were on fire, something like neon lights, objects that were red, glowing, brilliant, fiery, bluish-green, or pulsating green.

Not surprisingly, with all this publicity, the original incident quickly began to take on newly dimensions. Saucedo amplified his first statements and recalled that the object had been "torpedo-shaped," "like a rocket, but much larger," and that lights on the object had seemed to be winking on and off [4]. One book has since described the phenomenon as a "huge torpedo-shaped machine." [5. p. 114] Those who wanted to believe in flying saucers easily ignored the discrepancy between the "flaming ball" or "fiery tornado," originally described by Saucedo, and a bluish-green torpedo-shaped machine more than 150 feet long.

For days the Russian satellites had to share the spotlight with the American flying eggs, while both amateur and professional investigators tried to solve the mystery. UFO authorities unhesitatingly deduced the presence of a flying saucer with E-M powers. Various astronomers, when urged by newsmen, reluctantly acknowledged the cut-off theories based on the meager printed accounts. Dr. La Paz, of the Institute of Meteorites in New Mexico, suggested that the things seen at Levelland might have been fireballs. A reporter assigned to

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 67—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
the Harvard-Smithsonian Observatories to cover Moonwatch obser-
vations of the new Sputnik gave a sketchy summary of the inci-
dent to D. Menzel, who also concluded that Saucedo might have
seen an unusually bright meteor and, startled by its brilliance, might
accidentally have killed the engine. Lacking news of Sputnik II,
the reporter sent in a factious story asserting that, according to
the director of the Harvard College Observatory, the flying eggs
were mirages that so frightened the drivers that they reacted by
pressing a "nervous foot" on the accelerator and killing the engine.
When the weather conditions at Levelland became known, of
course, the meteor theory was immediately discarded. Dr. Nininger,
of the American Meteorite Museum in Arizona, made the best guess
of all: Saucedo had observed an example of that rare phenomenon,
ball lightning [6].
Within a few days an Air Force investigator visited Levelland
to study the incident. Members of civilian saucer groups complained
later that, since he spent only seven hours in the area, he had ob-
viously not taken the problem seriously and could not have found
the correct solution. Even seventy hours of labor, however, could
not have produced a clearer picture. Saucedo had unquestionably
had a frightening experience, very much as he originally described
it. But as in many UFO sightings, most of the other reports had been
stimulated chiefly by the general excitement. Three persons, not
"dozens," had seen the phenomenon near the ground. Some ten or
fifteen others (including the sheriff) had not observed it at close
quarters but had merely seen brilliant flashes of light in the sky.
After studying the weather reports and the descriptions given
by the various witnesses, the Air Force issued an explanation, un-
fortunately ambiguous because it omitted the necessary word
"either," stating that the phenomenon observed at Levelland had
been "ball lightning or St. Elmo's fire." Supporters of the saucer
theory seized on this ambiguity to protest, correctly, that ball light-
ning and St. Elmo's fire are two different phenomena. They went
on to conclude by some process of peculiar logic that neither ball
lightning nor St. Elmo's fire was involved and that the phenomenon
had actually been a flying saucer.
Saucer publications have printed thousands of words to support
this argument. The evidence, however, leads to an overwhelming
probability: the fiery unknown at Levelland was ball lightning.


- page 46 -

In Levelland the night of November 2 conditions were ideal for the formation of ball lightning. For several days the area had been experiencing freak weather, and on the night in question had been visited by rain, thunderstorms, and lightning. Shortly before the glowing sphere approached the truck, the two men had noticed a lightning flash in a nearby field. The original description of the phenomenon—a "flaming ball" or a "fiery tornado" that floated toward and over the truck and detonated with light and heat—fits the classic picture of ball lightning. The truck's engine may have died for one of several reasons. The rain during the evening could have seeped under the hood and soaked the ignition or dampened the spark plugs. The feed line may have been clogged. Or the region of highly rarefied air created by the ball lightning may temporarily have deprived the engine of oxygen.

Of the other drivers near Levelland that night who reported having trouble with balky motors and seeing a blazing object like an egg-shaped fireball, three probably say ball lightning. Others, after hearing Saucedo's frightening story, perhaps unconsciously dramatized their own experiences and magnified ordinary lightning flashes into attacking fiery objects. It is significant that although the night was stormy, only Saucedo reported seeing the ordinary lightning that normally accompanies a thunderstorm.

Since ball lightning is short-lived and cannot be preserved as tangible evidence, its appearance in Levelland on the night of November 2 can never be absolutely proved, even though the explanation fits all the facts—facts that in themselves do not warrant so lengthy a study. Only the saucer proponents could have converted so trivial a series of events—a few stalled automobiles, balls of flame in the sky at the end of thunderstorm—into a national mystery. (Ball lightning doubles accounts for other UFO reports, such as the phenomenon observed at Lock Raven Dam on October 26, 1958, when two men returning late at night from a fishing trip saw a flaming ball hovering above the superstructure of a bridge; it exploded with a loud noise and a brilliant white flash and disappeared.)

One thing is certain. No evidence exists to suggest the presence of a spaceship over Levelland. Any extraterrestrial vehicle attempting to patrol the area that night would certainly have been seen and its path would have been accurately plotted. Moonwatch centers in New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado were all watching the skies for a passage of Sputnik, and in Texas itself official observers were on the alert at Big Spring, 100 miles southeast of Levelland, at San Antonio, 370 miles southeast; at Wichita Falls, 250 miles east; at Dodson, 162 miles northeast; and at Amarillo, 120 miles north. None of the trained witnesses at these stations saw anything in the sky that should not have been there.

Blinding 'Flying Saucer' 'Stops' Texas Motorcars

Levelland, Tex. (UP) — A mysterious egg-shaped object, red as a blinding glare and faster than the speed of sound, streaked over West Texas and New Mexico Saturday night and early yesterday, and one man said he even saw it sitting in the highway.

James A. Lee of Abilene, Texas, a member of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, rushed here to investigate and said he will send a report to Washington.

The object was also reported seen in the vicinities of Levelland, Tex., 110 miles south of Levelland, and Clovis, N.M.

About 70 miles northwest of Levelland.

THE MOST graphic description came from Jesse D. Long of Waco, Tex., who said the object killed the engine of his automobile and put out his headlights.

Other motorists said it did the same thing to their cars.

Long said the object appeared to be about 200 feet long and landed in the highway in front of his car. When he got out to investigate the thing took off straight up.

SHERIFF Weir Clem and Deputy Sheriff Pat McClough, who went out to investigate the reports, said they spotted the object streaking across the sky in front of their car.

"It lit up the whole pavement in front of us for about two seconds," said Clem.

Lee, thoroughly impressed, said reports that automobile engines stalled and headlights went out convinced him a flying object definitely existed.

He said machines inside the object "disturb the magnetic field of balance" and will cause car engines to stall and compasses to go awry.

LEE SAID he definitely did not think the object was launched by the United States.

Levelland motorist was the first to report sighting the thing. He was driving west of Levelland on State Highway 116 about 11:15 p.m. (CST) Saturday, when it flashed over him with a terrific noise.

THE EXPERT IS ---------------------- OF ABILENE, TEX. A MEMBER OF THE
NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA AND A DIRECTOR
OF INTER-PLANETARY SPACE PATROL, A WEST TEXAS ORGANIZATION WHICH
INVESTIGATES "FLYING SAUCERS" AND SIMILAR OBJECTS.

HE RUSHED HERE YESTERDAY UPON HEARING OF THE LATEST OBJECT,
SEEN BY A LEAST NINE PERSONS IN TWO STATES.

COINCIDING WITH RUSSIA'S LAUNCHING OF ITS SECOND EARTH SATELLITE,
THE "THING" WOULD HAVE CAUSED LITTLE MORE ALARM IF SMALL GREEN MEN
HAD JUMPED OUT OF IT.

THE EGG-SHAPED OBJECT, DESCRIBED AS ABOUT 200 FEET LONG AND A
BRILLIANT-RED, WAS GLIMPSED BY AT LEAST FIVE PERSONS IN THE
LEVELLAND AREA, INCLUDING THE SHERIFF, THREE PERSONS AT MIDLAND
AND ANOTHER AT CLOVIS, N. M.

ON ROAD ---------------------- SAID HE WAS DRIVING ON A FARM-TO-MARKET
ROAD AT LEVELLAND WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED THE OBJECT SITTING IN THE ROAD.

HE SAID IT WAS OVAL-SHAPED, ABOUT 200 FEET LONG AND GLOWED LIKE
A NEON SIGN. HE GOT OUT OF HIS CAR ABOUT 200 FEET AWAY TO INVESTIGATE
BUT WHEN HE DID THE OBJECT SUDDENLY TOOK OFF WITH A ROAR STRAIGHT
UP INTO THE AIR.

HE SAID HIS ENGINE COUGHED AND DIED AND HIS HEADLIGHTS SUDDENLY
WENT OUT. WHEN HE GOT HIS CAR STARTED, HE HURRIED BACK TO TOWN.

TWO OTHER PERSONS SAID THEY SAW THE OBJECT IN THE LEVELLAND AREA
ABOUT AN HOUR EARLIER. BOTH SAID THE OBJECT PASSED OVER THEIR CARS WITH A ROAR LIKE THUNDER.

THE ENGINES OF THEIR CARS DIED AND THE HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT, TOO.

ABOUT AN HOUR EARLIER, AND HIS DEPUTY, SPOTTED THE OBJECT STREAKING ACROSS THE SKY IN FRONT OF THEIR CAR.

WITH LIT UP THE WHOLE PAVEMENT IN FRONT OF US FOR ABOUT TWO
SECONDS," A BRILLIANT RED SAID. HE CALLED IT OVAL-SHAPED AND SAID IT LOOKED
LIKE A BRILLIANT RED SUNSET.

THE GROUND OBSERVER CORPS AT MIDLAND REPORTED THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING WEST AND VERY LOW EARLY SATURDAY NIGHT.

SAID HE SAW A STREAK OF LIGHT LIKE A FIRE BALL MOVING IN A SOUTH-
EASTERLY DIRECTION ABOUT 8 P.M. SATURDAY.

IF THESE THINGS (A SPACE CRAFT OF THE NEIGHBORING PLANETS)
HE DECLARED.

SAID MACHINES INSIDE THE OBJECT "DISTURB THE MAGNETIC FIELD
OF BALANCE" AND WILL CAUSE CAR ENGINES TO STALL AND COMPASSES
TO VARY CRAZILY.

HE SAID HE WILL MAKE A REPORT OF HIS INVESTIGATION TO WASHINGTON.

II. SUMMARY: Between 02/10GUST and 03/01/39ST, an oval shaped object, approximately two hundred feet long, was seen in the area of Levelland, Texas (FGOB3S). Two witnesses observed the object hovering or resting on the ground for five to five minutes. The information in this report was obtained from interviews with three sources during an investigation conducted to determine the possible cause of the sighting.

    Qualifications: None.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE seemed to the investigator to be very sincere about his sighting. He was appalled at the amount of publicity given his and was anxious to have the sighting resolved. He was unhesitating in his replies, however, during the course of further questioning, he admitted uncertainty in some of his answers. SOURCE can be considered usually reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that he was driving home from Lubbock, Texas (JUDD0935) on the night of 3 November 1957 at 0005 CST on Texas highway 116. Approximately four miles east of Seagraves, Texas (JUDD0235), the atmosphere on SOURCE's automobile lights was rather abnormal to normal, the engine of the automobile began cutting out as if it were not getting any gas. After he had quit running, he lights and car radio went out. SOURCE then got out of the car and lifted the hood to check for battery malfunction and, finding none, closed the hood of the car and turned around to look for help. It was at this time that SOURCE saw the object and returned to the inside of the car.

SOURCE described the object as oval shaped and he thought that the size of the object was about a baseball at arm's length. He estimated that the object was a desert-fire one hundred feet at its longest dimension. SOURCE stated that the object was white in color, with a greenish tint, possibly caused by the tinted windshield of SOURCE's car. (Refer to inclosure 1 for SOURCE's memory sketch of the object.)

SOURCE estimated that he had been observing the object for four or five minutes when it rose virtually straight up and out of his line of vision. SOURCE was unable to estimate the speed with which the object left the area and was unable to state the distance he was from the object.

Upon the departure of the object, SOURCE stated that the lights and radio of the car came on and the motor started with no difficulty.

SOURCE stated that there were heavy clouds in the area and a light rain falling.

SOURCE had no opinion concerning the possible cause of the sighting.

STATEMENT

I was driving home from Lubbock on state highway 116 at approximately 12:00 p.m. when the speedster on my car jumped to complete discharge, then it returned to normal and my motor started cutting out. Like it was out of gas. After it had quit running, my lights went out. I got out of my car and tried in vain to find the trouble.

I found nothing I closed the hood and looked for a passing motorist to obtain help. It was at this time that I saw this object, I got back into my car and tried to start it, but to no avail. After that I did nothing but sit and watch the object, which disappeared about 5 minutes later. I then resumed trying to start my car and succeeded with no more trouble than under normal circumstances. I then proceeded home very slowly and told no one of this sighting until my parents returned home from a weekend trip to Hobbs, New Mexico for fear of public ridicule. They did confirm that I should report this and did so to the sheriff around 1:30 p.m. Sunday November 3rd.

Because of the heat and speed of the object, SOURCE like a torpedo. The color of the object itself was blue. The object, from SOURCE's estimation, was two hundred feet long and three hundred feet away. SOURCE estimated the object was an eight foot long, and after ten seconds, SOURCE stated the object was able to restart the engine and drive away. Upon disappearance of the lights of the truck came on. SOURCE stated he thought the object was an electronically controlled rocket.

STATEMENT

To whom it may concern, on the date of November 2, 1957, I was traveling north and west on route 116, driving my truck. At about four miles out of Levelland, I saw a big flame, to my right, from the ground. Then I thought it was lightning. But then this object had reach to my position, 15 was different. Because it put my truck motor out some heat. Then I stop, got out, and took a look, but, it was so rapid and quite a scene. Then I had to hit the ground; I also had three colors, yellow, white and it look like a torpedo, about 200 feet long, moving at about 600 to 800 miles an hour.

STATEMENT

The information contained in this pamphlet is given not to mislead anyone and
is of my own observance.

On the night of 2 November 1957, at approximately 2310, my wife, 2 children
and myself departed my father's home in Sudan, Texas. At approximately 2330, in the vicinity
of Sudan, Texas, my wife and I noted occasional lightning and at the same time static
on our radio. At approximately 2350 or 2355, I turned south (at Shamrock, Texas)
to our southwest. In just a few minutes, later still bolts of lightning occurred
1-3 seconds, and then came back on. My radio cut out 1/2hrs. went out for approximately
2 more 1/2 hrs. At this time I hit my wife and I remarked that we certainly a
stone still or something to the effect. We did talk somewhat about this until
the location and the time factor, certainly coincides with this flash of lightning
that my wife and I observed.

SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At CL/2045 CST November 1957, SOURCE was driving about seven miles north of Sundown, Texas (WCN3L3c) on farm road 300 (refer to location 1, Post Seven) when he saw a red object, the size of a basketball at arm's length in the northwest. The object appeared to be swinging in about a quarter mile arc from north to south. SOURCE watched the object for about three or four minutes. At the ends of the arc, SOURCE stated (name and sparks were given out) as to be a large stationary object. The object appeared to be a hose or cable to a larger stationary object. The stationary object appeared to be a similar to a balloon. After three or four minutes, the object, still swinging, turned white and rose at a rapid rate of speed into the clouds and disappeared. SOURCE stated that it was pitch dark with no stars and no moonlight, thick, heavy clouds at a light rain. SOURCE had no opinion as to the possible cause of the sighting.

STATEMENT

While driving north about 7 miles north of Sundown, Texas, I saw a light about the size of a basketball about 200 or more feet above ground traveling from east to west. I stopped by side of road with my wife and watched the object, a bright red light picked off a glow. It apparently stopped and began swirling, from north to south about 1 mile distance while getting higher slowly and fire or sparks studded to a center. Then cutting into something out with visible smoke. An object above it seemed to hold up the light on a cable or nose appearing link between the light and balloon object. It continued swirling north 3 or 4 minutes and then at a fast rate of speed it went straight up into the clouds and disappeared or the light went out.

SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

1. A check with Lowry Flight Service, Cornwall Flight Service, Reese AFB Operations, and Lubbock, Texas CAA for any traffic in the area produced a negative reply.

2. A check for balloon operations showed that Amarillo and Midland, Texas weather stations released balloons at 12:00% and 20:00% daily. However, these balloons were not likely to be in this area.

3. An interview with Dr. Ralph J. Underwood, BA, MA, PhD, Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy at Texas Technological College revealed the following information:

    a. The amount of rain in the area, together with the condition of the crops, could have developed a phenomenon similar to St. Elmo Fire.

    b. The possibility of burning excess gas from nearby oil operations reflecting off low clouds existed.

    c. The possibility of lightning stalling a car and extinguishing the lights existed; however, this possibility decreases as the number of such incidents increases.

4. A check with Reese AFB and US Weather Bureau at Lubbock, Texas revealed the following weather conditions:

    a. A shallow temperature inversion existed from the surface to approximately 6,000 ft.

    b. A complete overcast existed with a 400 foot observed ceiling and visibility at 3 miles.

    c. Winds were as follows:
    SURFACE: Light and variable
    6,000   : 160 degrees at 18 knots
    10,000  : (170 degrees at 25 knots)
    16,000  : (230 degrees at 35 knots)
    20,000  : 210 degrees at 35 knots
    30,000  : 250 degrees at 65 knots
    50,000  : 215 degrees at 65 knots

    d. There was a drizzle or light rain throughout the period.

5. A check with oil companies in the area revealed that a limited amount of excess gas from oil operations was being burned. Most of the gas is returned to the ground.

6. A check for downed power lines during the period was made with negative results.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER

1. The following comments concerning the descriptions, reliability, etc., of the SOURCES treated in Parts One through Six are offered:

    a. Only one observer (Part One) said an object hovered over or on the ground. Others (Parts Two) and Six said an object moved and had a low altitude, and one observer (Part Six) saw an object hovering and swirling in a pendulum motion over the sky (Parts Three and Four) or a bolt of lightning (Part Five).

    b. Reference Part Two. This observer's account of the sighting cannot be relied upon. His statement that the object was going at "incredible speed" is not supported, and that the object was three hundred feet away from his car is not compatible with the reported length of the sighting. Also his description of the weather conditions does not agree with the established conditions in the area.

    c. The observers treated in Parts Three and Four reported desire only a streak of light. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, it is as said for lighting these sightings with the sightings treated in Parts One, Two, Five and Six.

    d. Reference Part Six. The sighting described in this part occurred two days after the sighting treated in Part One. The other parts of this sighting are so completely different and unsupported by other sightings that the Preparing Officer feels that it is not considered with the other sightings.

    e. Reference Part Five. The sighting treated in this part is included only as a possible explanation for the other sightings. The fact that the radio and lights were cut out for a few seconds by the lightning in this sighting indicates lighting interference could have entered into the other sightings.

    f. Reference Part One. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the sighting treated in this part is the most important. The reliability, sincerity, and intensity of this 3000 record lens evidence to this account of this sighting.

2. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the following possibilities cause this sighting exist:

    a. Weather phenomena, such as St. Elmo Fire or a similar phenomenon.

    b. Ball lightning. There were nimbus clouds in the area, which, according to information at the examination must be present for ball lightning to occur.

    c. Reflection of excess burning gas from a very low cloud cover.

    d. A meteorological phenomenon which could be any combination of paragraphs 2a, b, and c above.

3. It is felt that insufficient knowledge of the above phenomena exists at this organization to completely resolve this sighting. Therefore, this sighting is forwarded unresolved.

1. LEVELLAND INCIDENT     2 November 1957 (UNCLASSIFIED)

a. A mysterious object, whose shape was described variously as ranging from round to oval, and approximately blue-with-in color was observed separately by six persons near the town of Levelland, Texas. Time of observations ranged from 2300 hours to after 0130 hours, night of 2-3 November 1957. Size of the object was estimated that of a basketball to that of an object 200 feet in length.

b. The unusual aspect of this incident was the statement by a number of observers that their car's ignition stopped completely during the occurrence.

c. In a matter of hours this incident was given nation-wide publicity by the nation's press, radio and TV networks. For the next 72 hours ATIC and Headquarters USAF were deluged with a flood of UFO reports, the majority of observers claiming to have encountered a somewhat similar phenomenon: a dazzling blush-white object, generally oval in shape, swooping down or floating near, that stopped their car's ignition. The reports were from persons of some standing in their communities casually reporting seeing the objects to those implicating that the "lights" stopped their cars in heavy traffic in the middle of large cities during broad daylight.

d. Intensive investigations revealed information not generally given by newspapers and other media previously. For examples it was pitch dark, rain and air was falling, a very low ceiling existed, there were lighting discharges, and the surrounding topk place near an area where grass areas from oil operations were being burned. In some instances, faulty ignition systems and rear fenders were found during the investigations.

e. A number of the observers interviewed admitted the presence of lighting or flashes of light. The precise source could not be located for internal and investigation by USAF investigators.

f. After exhaustive studies and analyses by the Air Force, and in full collaboration with outside scientists and experts, it was concluded that the sighting was the very rare lightning phenomenon - ball lightning. No definite conclusion has been reached regarding the possible effects of ball lightning on ignition systems. (All agreed that the combination of conditions existing in the area at the time were certainly conducive to the phenomenon. A study of the very few existing photographs of actual ball lightning continued.)

LEVELLAND INCIDENT | 2 November 1957 (UNCLASSIFIED)

a. A mysterious object, whose shape was described variously as ranging from round to oval, and predominantly bluish-white in color was observed separately by or near the town of Levelland, Texas. Times of Observation ranged from 2300 hours to after 0130 hours, night of 2-3 November 1957. Size of the object was estimated from that of a basketball to that of an object 200 feet in length.

b. The unusual aspect of this incident was the statement by a number of observers that their car's ignition stopped completely during the occurrence.

c. In a matter of hours this incident was given nation-wide publicity by the nation's press, radio and TV networks. For the next 72 hours ATIC and Headquarters USAF were deluged with a flood of UFO reports; the majority of observers claiming to have encountered a somewhat similar phenomenon: a dazzling bluish-white object, generally oval in shape, swooping down or floating near - that stopped their car's ignition. The reports were from parts of some standing in their communities casually reporting seeing the objects to those implying that only "lights" stopped cars in heavy traffic in the middle of large cities during broad daylight.

d. Intensive Investigations produced information not generally given by newspaper and other media. Practically, for example: it was pitch dark, rain and mist was falling, a very low ceiling existed, there were lightning discharges, and the fighting took place near an area where areas around oil operations were being burned. In some instances, faulty ignition systems and near freezing temperatures were found during the investigation.

e. A number of the observers interviewed admitted the presence of lightning or flashes of light. The prime source could not be located for interview and interrogation by USAF investigators.

f. After exhaustive studies and analyses by the Air Force, and in full collaboration with outside scientists and experts, it was concluded that the sighting was due to a very rare lightning phenomenon - ball lightning. No definite conclusion has been reached regarding the possible effects of ball lightning on ignition systems. (All agreed that the combination of conditions existing in the area at the time were definitely conducive to the phenomenon. A study of the very few existing photographs of ball lightning further confirmed the conclusion.)
