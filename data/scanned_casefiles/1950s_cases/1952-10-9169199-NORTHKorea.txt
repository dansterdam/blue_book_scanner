AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 1, 600th AIS3, APO 970                REPORT NO.        52-276                PAGE    2    OF    4    PAGES

On 16 and 17 October 1952, 1st Lt William H. Cooper and 1st Lt Thomas A. 
O'Neill of the 619th Tac Con Sq, (USAF) Weather Control Group at K-47 were 
interviewed with regard to the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

On the morning of 16 October 1952, Lt Hooper, instructor pilot and Lt O'Neill, 
flt. were flying a combat mission in a T-6 aircraft over the eastern sector of 
the main line of resistance. At 0650N, Lt Hooper was flying the aircraft on a 
magnetic heading of 280 degrees, 140 miles per hour; indicated air speed, 6,300 
feet indicated altitude. Lt O'Neill was on the same aircraft. The ULR for activity when he 
observed what he thought was a strange aircraft at 6,000 feet altitude, traveling 
approximately 200 mph and heading in an easterly direction. Then he first 
observed the object at was at approximately DT212343 and the T-6 
was at DT312362. The object was 15 degrees to the right of his course traveling 
on a magnetic heading of 100 degrees.

Lt O'Neill called the object to the attention of Lt Hooper who did not 
observe it until the aircraft and the object came parallel, lie then saw it at 
the 3 o'clock position. Lt O'Neill stated that as he was calling off the relative 
positions of the object, for Lt Hooper, (who was straining to pick it up) the 
object appeared to be decelerating. By the time Lt Hooper observed it, the 
object had apparently ceased to move and was hovering over DT2942. Both observers 
report the fact that the object ceased movement, put 11 feet to 12 length of 
time of the hovering. Lt Hooper estimates the time at 1 1/2 seconds and Lt O'Neill 
reports the time to be approximately 1 to 2 seconds.

Lt Hooper dipped the right wing of the aircraft for a better observation of 
the object. It began to move, accelerating in an easterly direction 
and disappeared from sight in the haze as the T-6 came about in a 120 degree, 
one speed of the object at this time was estimated by both observers to be 
approximately 800 mph. Lt Hooper bases his estimation upon the time elapsed in 
its covering approximately 15,000 meters.

Lt O'Neill stated that at first he thought the object was a jet or liaison 
type aircraft, but upon further observation it did not appear to have any aero-
dynamic features. Both observers concurred in the statement that the object was 
precisely circular in shape and metallic in color with no protrusions of 
any type. Both observers stated that the object did not appear to have any 
visible means of propulsion and no vapor trails or smoke were apparent. The 
estimated size was 25 feet in diameter, by comparison with the 37 foot wing span 
of a T-6 aircraft at the same distance. No sound from the object was audible at 
any time.

The object was under observation for approximately three minutes from 0450N, 
to 0550N with Lt O'Neill observing it for the full period of time. Lt O'Neill 
who made his observations with the naked eye, described the object as "moving 
slightly until a hovers, was more or less stationary, did not give a relative 
anything other than that it looked just like a "ball bearing".

The nearest observation was made at a distance of 3 to 4 miles.

The object was seen against three back-ground clouds at the first sighting.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

hills at the hoverin- position, and sky as it traveled away, and seemed constant
as to size, shape and color to both observers.

The pilots stated that at no time during their observation did the object
increase or decrease in altitude.

The weather conditions at the time was 4/10 covered at 4,000 feet with bases
at 4,500 feet. Visibility, air to air was 10 miles, air to ground 5 miles, wind
velocity and direction was unknown. The sun was to the rear of the 7-6 as the
observation was made until the aircraft made a right turn near the end of this
observation, when the object was now away from the observers in an east north
easterly direction, disappearing from sight.

CONTENTS OF PREPARED OFFICE:

1. Both pilots are in their thirties and seemed level headed and reliable.
They reported to the incident and reacted to the interval with no apparent nervous-
ness or excitement. They were quite certain in their descriptions and gave a
clear deal of detail. (their reporting of the incident was very factual). It
is considered that their judgment in estimating distance and dimensions and it
excellent. All their estimates of dimensions, speed and distance were given by
comparison to some known factor, for example the speed of their own aircraft as
compared to jets and F-51's that they worked with. They had no predeter-
mined opinion as to what their observation might have been, although they imme-
diately discounted the possibility of its being a weather balloon because of its
solid metallic appearance and perfectly circular shape.

2. Reference is made to Intelligence Report 52-121, dated 24 June 1952, Det
42, 600kth Air Intelligence Service Squadron. This report contains information
concerning the sighting of a large enemy captive balloon located in the grid
square PT94k in the area of hill 1920. This balloon, anchored by cable, has
been sighted several times, during daylight and in darkness by means of a
light sometimes suspended from it. It has been spotted far away from its tile
down point at PT204 by ground observers. On 7 June 1952, at approximately
2120T, a light was observed by a representative of this unit for a period of one
hour and five minutes in the PT134k area. Tentatively ground observation posi-
tion was a large balloon being raised and lowered by means of a cable at this
point on a June 1952 at 1645T. The balloon has been observed to move horizontally
very rapidly, in some cases it has been described as being 90° shaped, in others
the shape is "S-curved as round". The balloon has been observed at altitude of
from 1,500 to 10,000 feet.

3. The location of the reported position of this captive balloon is approx-
imately 4,500 meters and at a bearing of 223 degrees from the position of the
sighting as reported by the source. At this place the observer, the object and
the balloon coincide on the balloon in almost a direct line of sight. The wind was
from 270 degrees at 20-25 knots per hour. It is possible that the object sighted
by the source was the reflection of this balloon. The source's statement, when
a ground reflection could be eliminated, points to the possibility of a balloon
by the prevailing wind could be mistaken for an object traveling in an south
easterly direction. The object appeared to stop and hover over PT204A23.
Change of wind direction or an air pocket could have caused this reaction.

D/F TEST Comments:

1. Airborne orientation of a small airborne object in reference to a maneuver during aircraft is extremely difficult, particularly when the aircraft is very near to the object. Since the reference points would normally be points on the ground near the line-of-sight to the object, a nearby object would appear to be moving rapidly and would, in effect, appear to be moving in a direction opposite to the relative motion of the observing craft.

2. Since enemy balloons are known to have been used in this vicinity, this observation was probably of the same location reported in IR-52-124, Det A, 600th AISS, dated 24 June 1952.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Report No. 58-276                                                                                                                17 October 1952

On 16 October 1952 while in the vicinity of the Punch Bowl, DT 2842 at 0652Y, while on a heading of 280 degrees, I observed an unidentified object apparently three (3) miles North Northwest of my position, traveling on an Easterly heading and climbing down. Spherical shaped, approximately twenty-five (25) feet in diameter. When first observed, I dropped the right wing to get a better view of the object. At this time the object was observed to stop and hover.

Object observed moving in an East North Easterly direction, accelerating to what I estimated to be about 500 miles per hour. As the object started moving, I turned and started to take evasive action. Object was outlined against a background of 15,000 meters in such a short lapse of time.

At the time of the observation, I was wearing Air Force issued sun glasses and, pilot in the cockpit was observing it with the naked eye. Object appeared to have the same color and shape as a ball bearing. The sun was at my back and when I first observed the object it was outlined against a background of hills. My altitude was 6,300 feet indicated and the object was at approximately 6,000 feet indicated. I first observed the object in the vicinity of DT 28542.

I observed the object until it was in the vicinity of the coastline at which time I faded from sight due to early morning haze over the scene.

From my heading, the object was observed at the following clock positions:
1, 2 and 3 o'clock. At 3 o'clock, the object was outlined against a background of hills. I observed the object for about 15 seconds at the hovering position.
