DATE: November 8, 1956

IT WAS 5:15 PM. DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME OF 18TH, 1956. I SAW THIS VERY BRIGHT OBJECT ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL. IT WAS A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH OF TOWN AND THERE WERE AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE WATCHING. THIS OBJECT STAYED IN THE SAME POSITION UNTIL 6:00 PM EXCEPT A SLIGHT DRIFTING TO THE EAST. THROUGH FIELD GLASSES THE OBJECT SEEMED TO CHANGE SHAPE FROM BRIGHT TO LEFT WITH A DARKER SUBSTANCE CONTINUING OUT OF EACH SIDE WITH A PULSATING ACTION. AT 6:00 PM THE OBJECT CHANGED IN SIZE FROM A BASKET BALL TO THE SIZE OF A PIN HEAD. THIS CHANGE IN SIZE TOOK NOT LONGER THAN ONE MINUTE. I CONTINUED TO WATCH THE OBJECT UNTIL IT HAD DRIFTED OVER TO THE MOON WHICH WAS 7:00 PM.

THE WEATHER WAS WARM ABOUT 70°. SKY CLEAR. NO CLOUDS AT ALL. REPORTS CAME IN FROM CEDAR GROVE, NJ, ORANGE, NJ, SUSSEX, NJ, MOST OF NORTHERN NEW JERSEY. SAW THE OBJECT FROM ACCOUNTS IN THE PAPERS. I FEEL CERTAIN PEOPLE WILL MAKE AND TELL THE SAME DESCRIPTION AS THIS WERE SEEN DURING THIS WHOLE PERIOD.

[Location redacted], New York

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your letter dated 17 October 1956, addressed to the Secretary of the Air Force, has been referred to this Center for reply.

With regard to your first question, a balloon can be seen at two widely separated points (a course, of course) on its height. However, as our records indicate, when weather balloons are observed, they may not be seen some 20 by two observers indicating that being the case, hundreds of scheduled and unscheduled balloons are released throughout the United States every hour. For example, weather balloons are released all over the world, approximately at 10 a.m., C300, C900, 1500 and 2100 - one time. Your nearest U. S. Weather Station will provide you with further details.

Commenting on your second question, we are certain that as you are a photo technician with some knowledge of optical computations, a large astronomical calculation with immense skill is involved as 70,000 feet, and appearing the size of a basketball to the naked eye, would be of such tremendous size that in all probability the volume of many circumstances would scarcely fail to notice and report it. A single experiment will demonstrate this by holding a basketball in front of you and resting the bottom edge on the horizon. The ball would cover almost half of the visible sky. Fairly large balloons when viewed at a distance of 10,000 feet will only appear about the size of a large marble held at arm's length. Balloons definitely can be seen up to 70,000 feet under ideal weather conditions, but not the size you indicate.

Regarding your third question, numerous tests and experiences with the effects of 14,400 on balloons, particularly when the sun is setting, has shown that unusual and pulsating masses and displays are produced. In many instances, balloons at high altitudes and over locations that are in total darkness will glow with a brilliant red or orange light reflecting from the glow and under surface of the balloon. This results from the glancing rays of the sun that may be some degrees behind the horizon and invisible to the ground observer. The majority of balloons launched at night carry lights.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

With respect to your fourth question, there was no wave or delusive problem in the reporting of unidentified aerial objects.

To a large extent, the Air Force is dependent upon the general public for information and data on such matters. The nationwide Ground Observer Corps has changed its method of obtaining information in this undertaking. In fact, the GDO project was declassified and a summary of the results released to the general public by the Department of Defense some time ago, and attached for your information.

As to your query in question five, you are referred to your nearest public or local library for details concerning Project Grudge, the Air Force codes.

In general, a survey of our files discloses that there was a considerable amount of bloch activity in the general area and on the date into which you report.

If you were an observer to the sighting in question you say, if you desire, accompany the current Air Force UFO questionnaire addressed herewith and such other necessary data required for analysis and final conclusion are lacking in your letter. Therefore, it would also be appreciated if you would include a statement as to the methods, circumstances and information used in arriving at some of the data submitted in your letter for example, the figure of 70,000 feet, a necessary item in calculations.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
