9 June 1953                   UNCLASSIFIED                   Tillamook, Oregon

Description

One unidentified object was reported by two USAF officers stationed with the Moby Dick balloon launching detachment, Tillamook, Oregon. This object was seen at 1010 PST 9 June 1953. The object was viewed through a thedolite and appeared half-moon in shape and white in color. It appeared to hover and no manner of propulsion was observed. No manner of disappearance was reported.

Discussion

During such a long period of observation, any conventional object known to be on this earth would, under existing conditions, have moved more than this particular object did. The winds at 30,000 feet were from 120 deg at 25 knots. Project Blue Book's astronomer was contacted and they stated that this sighting was undoubtedly the planet Venus which, under ideal conditions, can be seen during the daylight hours.

Conclusion

Was astronomical (Venus).

Your interest in reporting this incident and your desire to be of service are greatly appreciated by the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

Dear Lt. Olsson;

Of the last batch of 4 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is any question is the 12 June Covington, Georgia. It is essential to know here the duration of sighting. A lot depends on this. Can you get this for us?

Regarding the Detroit 11 June case is there anything in this that a good landing light would not explain? Likewise Goggles AFS 11 June it would appear that also second radar did not pick up the signal, the most probable explanation is faulty radar. I assume that the OCR had many available.

And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.

Anything new on:
5 March     Shaw AFB
3 March     Luke AFB - Film?
17 Feb.     Port Austin
23 March    San Antonio
12 April    Stead AFB

I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's clearance so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything but just mentioning it anyway. I hope it comes through before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
Allen Hynek

INFO: FROM: ATIC-ATIAC-6-11-3

Reference your FLYOREPT PSC 09-7-02, ATIC requests answers to the following questions
in order to analyze the subject sightings: 1) What direction was the object from the
observer? 2) How long was the object observed? 3) What were estimated and elevation readings
taken from the theodolite? 4) What was the wind generally from the ESE? Give cloud coverage and general visibility conditions. 5) Could the moon have caused the sighting
because of confusing weather conditions?

It is imperative that Project Blue Book have the position of the object from the
observers to establish whether or not it could have been the moon.

Reply by wire is requested. Cite Project Blue Book.
