assured the reporter of my story and he later stated that he thought the complete story would be in the Sunday, May 4th issue. However, for some unknown reason it never appeared.

I have no personal desire to see this story in print but I believe it is about time that the authorities, as well as the citizens, be openly informed of a systematic procedure in handling reports as important as this instance. I firmly believe that this same handling a reconnaissance tour over the area and if my report had been handled efficiently, we would be in a more intelligent position to know more clearly their intentions.

I further feel, with due respect to the Army, that "someone was sleeping at the switch", or if it is being kept "hush, hush", that the public reaction will be mass hysteria when the unknown definitely attempts to make contact with us (as has been proven in the past). Experience has taught us that education toward events to come adjust the human mind to accept phenomena and cope with them.

Listed here are the names and addresses of witnesses mentioned above. I can also present an article from the Birmingham Eccentric that the police furnished the newspaper, ridiculing my reports to them saying, "What could the police do if we had invaders from the sky." This proves that the law officers are not briefed or alerted to the possibility of future events.

Gentlemen:

I have been a faithful believer and follower of Flying Saucer incidents as far back as 1943 and was of the opinion that they were a project of the U. S. Government, but after my recent experience which I am going to outline in detail, it has changed my belief entirely.

Coincidently, I happened to read the April 7th issue of Life Magazine which precedes my experience by a couple of weeks, explaining my actions, as you will note.

I live approximately seven miles west of Birmingham, Michigan which is north of Detroit about fifteen miles. On Sunday night, April 27th, my wife, two children and myself were proceeding home from my sister's traveling north on Stevenson Highway at 10:45 P. M. As I turned left on Fifteen Mile Road (Fifteen Mile Road runs through Birmingham east and west and this point is about seven miles east of Birmingham), my wife and I both spotted a brilliant white object coming toward the sky from the northeast. It descended so fast that by the time my wife could realize and state that it was a Flying Saucer, it had descended to its ultimate height of approximately 3,000 feet or its apparent height of a transport plane in flight. It stopped abruptly and looked slightly similar to a new boat in choppy water. It then settled at an approximate 20° angle and the brilliant white object dimmed to what appeared to be window lights. It sat in this exact position and spot for approximately three or four minutes making it very easy for us to judge its size, shape, etc. Its estimated size to be about two miles north of us and 3,000 feet high. The craft had two tiers of windows each about ten feet high which appeared to be looking into the playing section of a mouth organ. The windows were all around the entire diameter making visible the round flatness. We estimated conservatively that the diameter of this ship was at least two hundred feet.

After what seemed to me they were getting their bearings, they started drifting northwest toward the city of Pontiac at about one hundred miles per hour but stopped two or three times during the time of our observation. At no time did it make a noise.

Immediately I realised that I should have witnesses to this phenomenon, so I speeded west on Fifteen Mile Road to a drive-in restaurant about a mile away. I ran in and asked some young men if they would come out and witness my experience. After persuasion, two of them went out and were amazed, causing others to follow. By this time it had drifted at least five miles northwest. At this point I called the Birmingham police and asked them to alarm all the air fields in its direction which they said they would do. I returned to my car and we continued to follow it driving west on Fifteen Mile Roads. During the next five minutes the lights in the Saucer went off and on three times. The third time the lights changed from white to a brilliant yellow orange and by this time we had reached the Grand Trunk Railroad Station, a half mile from Birmingham. Thinking this experience would make a good newspaper story, I stopped at the railroad station and called the Detroit Times telling them my story thus far.

After that I again called the Birmingham police and asked them if they had reported the incident as yet. They said they were thinking about it so I became provoked and said I would call Selfridge Field, which I did. If anyone ever got the "Brush" I sure did. I was transferred to five different departments and finally got an officer who, I am sure, was awakened by my call and was very perplexed. I explained what was taking place and he mumbled something to another fellow and then said, "I'll report it. That's your name?" I gave him my name and explained, "If you ever want a close-up view of a giant Saucer, get some planes in the sky at once," telling him the approximate location of the Saucer. Then he repeated, "All I can do is report it, Bud." Then he hung up.

During my telephone conversation, my wife had convinced the station attendant and railroad express truck driver to observe the spectacle. I secured the truck driver's name and then proceeded west on Fifteen Mile Road through Birmingham and out about seven miles due west following the Saucer until it vanished from our vision over the tree tops toward the general direction of Flint at 11:15 P.M.(½ Hour)

I contacted the Detroit Times Tuesday A.M. and gave them my complete story. Their reporter phoned Selfridge Field and the Radar Division and they both told him that it was impossible for anything to be in the air at that time because nothing was picked up by Radar, so naturally, the Times dropped the story.

To prove my story, I started to trace down my witnesses. After considerable difficulty, I found the two young men I asked to come out of the drive-in and outside restaurant statements from each. Then I contacted the truck driver and he was very willing to write a statement of his observation.(their names and addresses are at the end of this letter.) I again went to the Times with my proof and the editor turned the story over to another reporter who again phoned Selfridge Field. They stated that they were receiving at least two letters a day from people who had also sighted the Saucer at different points. This
