SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object on 13 May 1954
over Oceanside, California Special Inquiry, HQ 24-532

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Forces
Washington 25, D. C.

1. PREMISE: On 27 May 1954, advice was received by letter from the District Intelligence Officer, Eleventh Naval District, San Diego, California, to the effect that 1st Lt. MCGIRT, Squadron Leader, Royal Air Force, on duty with the Marine All Weather Fighter Squadron 542, at Mira Mesa, California, reported sighting an unidentified flying object while flying in the vicinity of Oceanside, California, 1240 hours, 13 May 1954.

2. DETAILS: Squadron Leader MCGIRT, in a signed statement, advised that on 13 May 1954, he was on an ATA exercise as pilot of F3D2, WH20 in conjunction with F3D2, WH13, piloted by Major HEINIG. This exercise was carried out at 22,000 feet in the Oceanside, California area, and was for the most uneventful.

At approximately 1220 hours, MCGIRT took up the right wing position on WH13 and a descent was commenced on a heading of 240 degrees, speed 500 knots indicated. As he closed formation in WH13, MCGIRT observed what appeared to be an aircraft in the eleven o'clock position. Just visible over the cockpit of WH13. MCGIRT did not estimate the range, but immediately realized that a head-on collision was between the object and the WH13 appeared imminent. Before MCGIRT could take any move to transmit, the object passed just over WH13 and between WH13 and his aircraft. For an instant, MCGIRT observed the object in plain view. He described it as dark gun metal blue with no visible markings. It appeared to measure approximately half to 1 length of the F3D (about 22 feet). A third man was visible on the upper half. The wing span was the size of, or a little less than, the total length. The "gun metal glint" was most noticeable, according to MCGIRT, the course of the object was appraised slightly 330 degrees.

and it appeared to be descending at an angle of about 24 to 30 degrees. HIGGIN could only state that its speed appeared to be "very high," at least that of the F3D, and probably much higher.

HIGGIN stated that this series of events took place with great rapidity, and by the time he was able to explain to his Radar Observer, Flight Lieutenant R. W. DALY M, the object had vanished to his left.

Squadron Leader HIGGIN stated that he was left with the impression that HILO had been struck, and immediately virtually shocked and confused Major BROWNELL at this time.

Neither Major BROWNELL, Radar Observer, nor Squadron Leader HIGGIN, Flight Observer, 11th Liaison, had seen the object.

Squadron Leader HIGGIN concluded by stating that the altitude of all three aircraft at this time of this incident was approximately 16,000 feet, the time 1248, and the position as 10 to 15 miles southeast of Lake Elsinore.

In a signed statement, RONALD W. DALY, Flight Lieutenant, Royal Air Force, Flight Radar Observer for Squadron Leader HIGGIN at the time of this incident, corroborated the statements, altitude, and location, and the fact that HIGGIN asked him, "Did you see that?" to which DALY replied that he did not.

The statements were executed by HIGGIN and DALY, along with a sketch of the object as it appeared to HIGGIN, are attached to this report for the Air Tactical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Attention: AFCIN-20, as Enclosures 1, 2, and 3.

STATEMENT OF FLIGHT, Donald R. Sqdr. RAF

Sighting report---Unusual Object

On Tuesday 18 May 1954, I was scheduled as pilot of F302, WN20 for an AIA exercise in conjunction with F502, WN19, pilot Major R. Browning. The exercise was carried out at 22,000 feet in the Central area and was uneventful. At approximately 1240 I took up the right wing position on WN19 and a descent towards base was commenced on a heading of 240 degrees, speed 300 knots indicated. As I closed formation on WN19 I observed what appeared to be an aircraft in the eleven o'clock position just visible over the cockpit of WN19. I did not estimate range, but immediately realized that it was approaching head on and that a collision hazard and object existed. Before I could make any move to transmit, the object passed just under WN18 and between that aircraft and my own.

For an instant I observed the object in plain view. It was of dark gun metal hue and bore no visible markings. It measured approximately the length of the wing, about 22 to 25 feet and was at a position, a third or a little less than the upper half. The wing span was this size, or a little less than the total length. The "gun metal" was not metallic.

The course of the object was approximately 050 degrees and it appeared to be descending at an angle of about 25 degrees to 30 degrees. Its speed can only be assessed as a very high at F30 and probably much higher. The series of events took place with great rapidity and by the time I had exclaimed to my R (Flight Lieutenant R. G. Dalton) the object had vanished to my left. With the impression that WN18 had been struck. I immediately visually checked and contacted Major Browning by VHF. Neither he nor his R had seen the object and pilot Lieutenant Dalton was not to be searched at the time.

The altitude of all three aircraft was approximately 16,000, the time 1643, and the position was fixed as 10°45'N, 105°25'E Southeast of Lake Elsinore.

STATEMENT OF DALTON, Ronald W., Flt.Lt. RAF                                   18 May, 1954

I was radar observer to S/Ldr Higgin in TW-20 of VF(n) 542. We were detailed to carry out an AIA exercise at 22,000 feet with TW-18 piloted by Major BROWNING.

At the conclusion of the exercise we commenced a let down in starboard echelon (loose formation). Major Browning being in the lead. Our distance from TW-18 was approximately 1,500 feet (250).

At approximately 1245 hours, on 240 degrees, westric heading and 15,000 feet altitude, S/Ldr Higgin made an evaluation to the effect, "did you see that"? I did not. I noted our position as approximately 117deg20'-38deg36'E. Lake Elsinore was clearly visible on our starboard side approximately 5-7 miles. I was looking down at the lake when the incident occurred. We continued to let down and landed at 1258 hours.
