10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Brilliant light shape of half circle on horizon. Appeared to cover many miles, center of circle was red, outer part ranged pale blue to red. Sharp line of distinction between yellow portion and blue-to-red portion, brilliant blue shaft of light radiated from semi-circle but stopped abruptly in sky. Blue light flickered 3 times. Observer was purportedly blinded by flash of light. Semi-circle faded to a dark red and disappeared.

11. COMMENTS
Due to fact that recently area of sighting was used as a photoflash bomb drop area, and that light "flickered" three times, a possible parachute type was suggested. Possibly a parachute dropped, high candle power flare. Parachute would account for shaft of light ending abruptly.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Possibly Balloon
Possibly Astronomical
Other: Pyrotechnic
Insufficient Data for Evaluation

SUBMITTED BY A WITNESS WHO VOL THE INFO SUBQ TO A CONSIDERABLE AMT OF
PUB IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS RLTV TO AN UNUSUAL FLASH OF LT WHICH WAS
OBSD BY A REPORTEDLY LARGE NO OF LOCAL PEOPLE ON THE NIGHT OF 25 SEP
55. THE NEWSPAPER ACCT CONCERNED A BRIGHT FLASH OF LT IN THE SKY
WHICH CAUSED AT LEAST ONE PERSON A SEVERE HEADACHE. THE WITNESS
CONCERNED IN THIS RPT ALSO CLAIMED THE PHENOMENA HE HAD SEEN IN THE
EARLY HOURS OF 25 SEP RESULTED IN HIS HAVING A SEVERE HEADACHE. THE
WITNESS ACCT INDICATES HE POSSIBLY SAW THE DETONATION OF A PHOTOFLASH

LOCAL ANG TAGPERCON UNIT AS A PHOTOFLASH BOMB DROP AREA: HOWEVER,
OFFICIALS OF THE ANG UNIT STATE NO DROPS HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE 19 SEP
55. IT IS POSSIBLE THE PHOTOFLASH BOMB DROP AREA WAS IN USE AT THE
TIME OF SIGHTING BY AN ORGANIZATION OUTSIDE OF THIS AREA. ONE OTHER
POSSIBILITY COULD BE THAT THE SIGHTING WAS OF A MET NATURE SINCE
MANY SIGHTINGS HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN REPORTED IN THIS AREA.
