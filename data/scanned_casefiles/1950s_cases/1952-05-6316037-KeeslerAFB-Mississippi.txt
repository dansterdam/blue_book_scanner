AF Reg 200-5 (FLYOBRPT)

On Wednesday, 7 May 1952, four Air Force personnel saw bright metallic objects near Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. The objects were traveling at a considerably greater speed than jet aircraft and were followed by a trail. Although no more than one object was seen at a time, a total of ten (10) were estimated to be in the sky. Due to the distance, the size and shape were not known, but to one observer they seemed to be cylindrical in appearance.
