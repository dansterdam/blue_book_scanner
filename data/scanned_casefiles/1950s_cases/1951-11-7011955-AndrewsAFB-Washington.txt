Date: November 10 1951
Time: 0320 EST
To: JAA concerned
Subject: Strange object Reported by a Capital Air Lines pilot to DCT tower.

At 0320 EST Washington tower called me and asked if I had seen any strange aircraft or objects flying around Andrews. I told them no. They then advised me that a Capital pilot, flight 610 had reported a strange object following his DC-4 for about 20 miles at 8000 feet. This object was reported not to be a star because of the brilliant light that it carried. Several other lights were seen on it also.

This object followed Capital 610 for 20 miles and then turned and went back. Washington tower then advised that the object was about east of Andrews. I saw it. It appeared to be moving very slowly, if at all. My attention was turned to some thing else and when I looked for this object again, it was gone. The only thing that I saw then was a bright star. I saw this same star before, when I saw the strange object. Later I saw the object again but it soon disappeared to the south. Washington tower requested an aircraft be sent to check it. Rodman 22, a 294 that was in the area flew to the south but didn't see anything. Washington radar advised that they were unable to pick it up on radar.

Base operations later advised me that this object could have been Venus. Weather advised that on a cold clear night Venus stands out very distinctly and at times creates strange illusions.

Could be, but what I saw passed under Venus, headed south.

The above statements are certified true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
