Here is the text I can read from the document:

At the top right of a circular diagram: "Not likely 2" Allied Hrs"

At the bottom right of the page: "Polaris approx."

The rest of the document appears to be a grid-lined diagram with some small markings and a circular section, but the text within the circular section is not clearly legible.


- page 15 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

"Hazy, Red-tinged, trail appeared in this approximate radius"

"Most likely a/c this"

"Polaris approximately 30Â° away (30Â°21'), thus"

The document appears to be a diagram with concentric circles and handwritten notes, seemingly related to an observation of an object in the sky with reference to the position of Polaris (the North Star).


- page 16 -

I had just finished setting my Argus "-2-" approximately 30 min. before my object appeared. Focusing time was about 15 min. before the URSA-MAJOR at best to my visual capacity.

The most peculiar thing I noted when seeing this was that if first was like a cloud, then I could not see it. I saw only a trail, its head, for about 3-5 min. duration. This was not a distinct object that could be pin-pointed, again more like a cloud. Noting the position of appearance and path of movement, after a depth not measurable, like the first, truly lasted about 3 minutes.

After its phenomenon became quite clear, I took about 7 pictures, some along the end of 3-5 seconds, after the trail came close of the end of 3-5 seconds. After the trail was seen, a bright fluorescent ob- ject was (or might have) still visible. The effect was quite of photographic film with a slight variation in color of light. It seemed to change after quite a few minutes in altitude of disappearance. It will in every slight turning of its shape, disappear into the sky. Altitude was on RB or Elliot's or on the horizon. In the semidistance of Will Carter and of another, it was quite clearly up and down, quite rhythmic motion, slightly raised at approximate declination of 160Â° to 170Â°.

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT

Date: May 13, 1952
Place: National City, Calif.
Time: Approximately 8:50 Pacific Daylight time

I had put my car in the garage and as is my habit, I stopped in the driveway to look at the stars. As I centered my attention on the Big Dipper, part of the constellation Ursa Major, I saw what I thought was the trail of a large meteor appear, approximately 5 degrees of arc east of a line between the two pointer stars and almost exactly in the center of the four stars forming the dipper

The trail was of a red color and appeared to be coming down at about an angle of 20 degrees to my line of sight and in a southwesterly direction. Only the red trail was visible for about two second and then a small white dot became visible, from which the trail was emanating. The speed appeared to be meteoric and so I still thought the object was what is commonly called a "meteor." The object continued down and the trail continued for about 2 or 3 more seconds. By this time the white object had an apparent diameter of about 1/64 to 1/32 in. The trail faded and the object still continued coming down. The speed appeared to be decreasing and I noticed a certain erratic quality to the flight of the object, which by now appeared to have a self-luminous or fluorescent quality.

As soon as the trail faded I was convinced that the object could not be a meteor - so I immediately called to my wife who did not hear me because of the noise of the television set and the noise the children were making. I was necessary for me to call her three or four times before she heard me and came out. This is the basis for estimating that after the trail faded, another 10 seconds must have elapsed before the object had attained level flight.

I speak of the fluorescent quality of the light emitted by the object, as opposed to the incandescent quality of the lights of aircraft. There were no rays radiating from it as are apparent around the intensely brilliant light of a filament type light seen at a distance.

The leveling-off process of the object seemed to require several miles of altitude and the radius of the curve must have been several miles. I had sent my wife back into the house to obtain my 6-power telescope. In order to see the object more closely. When she returned the object was flying level on a course almost due west. The object passed over and at a considerably higher altitude than a light plane. When my wife finally obtained the telescope the object was flying almost due south at an estimated altitude of 2000 or 3000 ft. I estimated the altitude of the object at this point of its trajectory to be from 10,000 to 15,000 feet. Its speed at this time appeared to be within the range of known aircraft speeds. To the naked eye the object appeared as a sphere of about 1/16 inch diameter. The fluorescence was of a white color tending toward yellow. Through the telescope the object presented a larger disk but the brightness did not appreciably increase. There was a slight blue halo, visible through the telescope which I believe may be attributed to chromatic aberration, since the blue color was not apparent to the naked eye.

- page 22 -

In level flight the object seemed to dart from side to side in an oscillating motion without diminishing of forward speed. When viewed through the telescope, the object would dart entirely out of the field of view.

After traveling a course almost due west for approximately one miles, the object turned toward the northwest and appeared to circulate over San Diego Bay and Point Loma and disappeared traveling north at a constant altitude and speed.

During the entire time the object was visible there was absolutely no apparent sound created by it. Despite its terrific speed in its dive there was no shock wave or noise from its power source.

At approximately 9:25 P.M. I observed the object returning on a circular course from the direction of downtown San Diego in approximately the same path over which it traveled northward. It passed almost overhead again at an elevation of approximately 45 degrees. The object described almost a 300 degree turn and my last sight of it was as it passed over downtown San Diego heading directly west. As it passed over the brightly lighted area, I got the impression that the ground lights were reflecting off a metal hull, and the fuselage and wings of one of our own aircraft as it flies overhead.

It is my conviction that since this object followed an apparently controlled course it was not moving under the influence of gravity, and must have been guided by an intelligence unknown to us. Its dive from an extreme altitude at possibly meteoric speed, its leveling off, and circling of the city twice indicate that it arrived from interplanetary space and was under intelligent control. One possible source of power which may be suggested at our present level of knowledge is some form of electronic propulsion. While many around for which may account for the strange gyration and also the fluorescence, which could be induced by ionization of either the object itself or the surrounding atmospheric gases, much in the manner of fluorescent lights, neon signs, and the Aurora Borealis and Australis.

In conclusion, it is my conviction that the object I observed was a space ship under the control and guidance of intelligent beings from a planet other than the earth.

ADDENDUM:

This object was also observed by the following persons:

This image appears to be a map of San Diego, California. The map shows a detailed street grid layout of the city, with streets and blocks clearly marked. The map includes areas such as Mission Beach, Mission Bay Park, and the Pacific Ocean coastline. On the right side of the image is an "INDEX TO ST" (partially cut off), which seems to be a street index listing various street names. The map is in black and white and appears to be from an older era, likely mid-20th century.

INDEX TO STREETS OF SAN DIEGO

Where an index number greater than 5 is shown refer to reverse side of Map for street location.

(The rest of the text is a long list of street names in multiple columns, which would be too extensive to transcribe in full. The image also contains a detailed map of San Diego showing various neighborhoods, streets, and geographical features.)

At the bottom of the map, there are some partially visible words like "SIGHTING" and "SEYMOUR", but the full context is not clear due to the image resolution.
