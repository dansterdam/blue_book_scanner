SUBJECT: Findings of Unconventional Airborne Objects, San Diego, California, March to June 1952.  

TO:  Director of Special Investigations  
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.  

1. SYNOPSIS: Source of information, an aeronautical engineer, San Diego, California, and associates maintain a flying club. When an unidentified aerial object sighted above the club, nine members watched and discussed it. Other observers are reported for further identification, evaluation, and investigation.  

2. DETAILS: The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), employed as a service organization in San Diego, California, along with several other engineers, has formed a voluntary flying group. Their activities in and around San Diego and its environs, according to investigators, when one member sighted an unidentified object in the sky, the other members of the club by telephone so that a "triangulation" and location could be made.

Mr. A has submitted to this office reports along with various photographs of an unidentified object sighted in San Diego, 22 March 1952, 13 May 1952, 21 May 1952, and 4 June 1952. All photos date from 1952 and are presented for further identification.  

Included with the above are reports submitted by two of Mr. A's associates, residents of San Diego, California, and a report concerning the sighting of a person size ball of light on 25 May 1952 and a similar sighting on 9 May 1952 by Mr. B at the address.

Text OCR output:

The minute I noticed something my Arg - 3 caught my eye. I saw an object fast from left to right low in the sky. It appeared to me to be an unidentified flying object as I was unable to identify it. It first appeared as a pinpoint of light trailing a long white light or stream behind it. As it moved across my field of vision, it appeared to be an elongated oval object. It moved at a tremendous rate of speed and seemed to accelerate as it went from left to right. I watched it until it disappeared over the horizon. Its speed was unnatural and very fast. It was not an aircraft, satellite, or meteor as I am familiar with these objects in the sky. The light or stream behind it was also unlike anything I have ever seen. I have gone over the incident in my mind many times and I can find no explanation for what I saw. I was extremely impressed by the tremendous rate of speed and the unnatural movement of the object. I have no doubt that I saw an unidentified flying object. The incident occurred at approximately 10:15 p.m. on the evening of May 8, 1952 in National City, California. I am a reliable and rational observer, and have had some experience in observing objects in the sky, having served for several years in the Air Force. I have no reason to falsify or exaggerate this report, and I would be willing to cooperate fully in any investigation of this incident. The object was observed for approximately 30 to 45 seconds as it traversed my field of vision.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT

Date: May 13, 1952
Place: National City, Calif.
Time: Approximately 9:15-10:15 Pacific Daylight time

I had put my car in the garage and as is my habit, I stepped in the driveway to look at the stars. As I concentrated my attention on the constellation Ursa Major, I saw what I thought was the trail of a large meteor appear. It was of a reddish color and appeared to be coming down at about an angle of 20 degrees to my line of sight and in a southwesterly direction. Only the red trail was visible for about two seconds with a small white glow at the end from which the trail was emanating. The speed appeared to be meteoric and as I watched, the object began to diminish in size, being visible for about two more seconds. I'd estimate the total time the object was visible was not more than five seconds.

By this time the white object had an apparent diameter of about 1/8 of a 1/3 in. The speed appeared to be decreasing and I noted a certain erratic quality to the flight of the object, which here and there appeared to have a slight flickering or "rocking" star.

As soon as the trail faded I was convinced that the object could not be a meteor, for it had solid body characteristics and did not leave a trail of sparks or the telltale sign that children were making. It was necessary for me to wait before I drew any conclusions, for estimating that after the trail faded, another 10 seconds must have elapsed before the object had attained a level flight.

I speak of the fluorescent quality of the light emitted by the object, as opposed to the incandescent quality of the lights of aircraft. There were no rays radiating from it as are apparent around the intensely brilliant light of a searchlight type.

The leveling-off process of the object seemed to require several miles of altitude gain. This would indicate that the radius of the curve must have been several miles. I had not my wife back into the house to obtain her power binoculars in order that I might see the object more clearly. When the encounter first began the object was flying level of, I would guess, a course of 210 degrees. There were no contrails or vapor trails such as are normally left by aircraft and the flight path was at no time erratic or jerky. Its speed at this time appeared to be within the sphere of about 1/16 inch diameter. The fluorescope was of a whitish color casting downward a fluorescent glow rather than the familiar cone of light through which I believe may be attributed to the change in altitude. The size of the known fluorescent area was not apparent to me at the time.

This page from the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. The text describes the sighting of a UFO object that was observed in the sky over San Diego, California on May 9, 1952. The report provides details about the object's movement, appearance, and behavior, as well as the witness observations. There is no photograph included on this particular page.

Text output from the document:

In level flight the object seemed to dart from side to side in an oscillating motion without diminishing or forward speed. When viewed through the telescope, the object would dart quickly out of the field of view.

After traveling a course almost due west for approximately one mile, the object turned northwest and appeared over San Diego Bay and Point Loma and disappeared traveling north at a constant altitude and speed.

During the sighting the object was observed through binoculars and the telescope, but there was no apparent diminution in its brightness despite its terrific speed. It was dive through there was no smoke visible.

At approximately 9:26 P.M. I observed the object returning on a circular course from the direction of downtown San Diego to approximately the same path over which it had appeared earlier. It rapidly changed direction and disappeared from view in a westerly direction. During its return the object appeared to be traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and it seemed to pass over downtown San Diego heading nearly west. I was able to observe it as it passed over downtown, but it was gone in a matter of seconds. It passed over downtown in the general direction it had followed originally, that is, traveling off to the west.

It is my conviction that if this object follows an apparently controlled course it was some manmade under the influence of extreme intelligent guidance. Its dive from an extreme altitude dive to possibly meteoric speed and its acceleration out of sight were indicative that it arrived from interplanetary space and was under intelligent control. One could conjecture the power source, which, as demonstrated, could carry the object through the heavens at tremendous speeds over vast distances, and also the fluorescence, which would be induced by ionization of either the object itself or the atmosphere surrounding it.

In conclusion, it is my conviction that the object observed was a vehicle from another planet under the control and guidance of intelligent beings from a planet other than this earth.

ADDENDUM:
This object was also observed by the following persons:
