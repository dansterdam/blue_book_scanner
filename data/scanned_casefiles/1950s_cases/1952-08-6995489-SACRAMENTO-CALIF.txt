1. In accordance with Air Force Letter 200-5, 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted.

a. Subject sighting consisted of three round, light orange colored objects moving at a size of grapefruit (size is observer's impression only since he had no idea of their height or distance). The objects were in a "V" formation and no aerodynamic features were visible. Speed appeared very fast and there was no sound or exhaust. The object on the right appeared to move toward the one on the left just before all three objects faded out and disappeared.

b. The objects were sighted at 2400 hours, Pacific Daylight time, on the night of 26 August 1952 and were visible for approximately four (4) seconds.

c. They were observed from the surface with the naked eye; no optical aids were used.

d. Observer sighted objects while in a parking lot near the Gibson Bus Line Terminal in Sacramento, California. The objects moved from South East to the North West and observer received impression they were quite high and at a great distance.

e. Observer is 24 years old and is assigned to the Intelligence Section of this organization. He has approximately 24 years experience. It is the opinion of the undersigned that he is a reliable source of information.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

While returning from a late movie in the city of Sacramento, California, the undersigned and an accompanying friend were going to where we had parked our car, in a parking lot near the Gibson Bus Lines.

My friend told me to look up into the sky and pointed in a northerly direction, the undersigned looked in the direction that the friend was pointing and saw three (3) orange colored objects, appearing to be the same size and shape of an average grapefruit. The objects appeared to be at an extremely high altitude and traveling at a very high rate of speed. After looking in the direction pointed and seeing the above mentioned objects the undersigned was able to get an approximate four (4) second sighting of the objects. As I watched then the objects flying on the right seemed to "pull over" in the direction of the object on the left, at about the point of collision the objects all three of them faded out and were gone. The objects were flying in a "V" formation and flying from the South to the North.

The above sightings took place at approximately 2400 hours on 26 August 1952, in the city of Sacramento, California.
