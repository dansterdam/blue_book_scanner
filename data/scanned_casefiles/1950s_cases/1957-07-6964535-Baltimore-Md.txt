Here is the text I can read from the document:

36/0524#
date

[Partially legible header text]

Note: This is a note with information. Text appears to be about Radio Traffic and some other details, but much of the text is obscured or blacked out. There are several sections with circled or highlighted areas.

At the bottom of the page, there is a handwritten note that reads:
"Note: This is not a note lot number. Told, dispatch on Radio Traffic. Anyway what is 35W - NNE, following given data and moving point angle shown."

The document appears to be from a UFO-related file, with many sections redacted or obscured. The page number "4/4" is visible in the top right corner.
