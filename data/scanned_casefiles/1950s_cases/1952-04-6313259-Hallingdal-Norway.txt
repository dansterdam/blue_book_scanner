AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

At approximately 2200 hours on 6 April 1952, a pastor living in Hallingdal, Norway, observed a strange aerial object which appeared to be about 20 meters in diameter, passing over his house at an altitude of about 500 meters. The object was observed for a period of about 5 minutes by several people.

The object appeared to have a reddish-orange glow and emitted sparks or particles of some sort at irregular intervals. The speed of the object was estimated to be about 800 km/hr, and its flight path was from southwest to northeast. No sound was heard.

It is obvious that the object observed was not within the range of the normal activities of the Air Force, and the report has been forwarded to higher headquarters for further investigation.
