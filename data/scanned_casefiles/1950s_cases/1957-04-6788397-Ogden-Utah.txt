Transcribed text from the document:

IT WAS NEAR OGDEN, UTAH SOME TIME DURING THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1957. A FAMILY DRIVING NORTH ON HIGHWAY 91 NEAR OGDEN, UTAH SIGHTED A STRANGE AERIAL OBJECT. IT WAS SAUCER SHAPED AND BRIGHT SILVER IN COLOR. IT MANEUVERED AROUND THEIR CAR IN A VERY ERRATIC FASHION FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. THE FAMILY STOPPED THEIR CAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE STRANGE OBJECT. IT SEEMED TO HOVER DIRECTLY OVER THEIR CAR FOR A TIME, THEN SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. THE FAMILY REPORTED THIS SIGHTING TO THE OGDEN, UTAH AIR FORCE BASE AND TO THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION OFFICE IN OGDEN. THEY WERE INTERVIEWED BY AIR FORCE OFFICERS AND THEIR STORY WAS CONSIDERED AUTHENTIC AND CREDIBLE BY THOSE INVESTIGATING THE SIGHTING.
