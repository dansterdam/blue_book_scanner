Tehran, Iran
8 May 1953

Statement of Patrol Observation of UFO Sighted.

On the 4th of May 1952 while stationed in Tepe, Iran, I was on the roof of my house to observe a bright object in the sky. I was with my brother-in-law. The object was very bright, about 150% larger than a star. It was stationary at first, then began to move.

I went up on the roof and lay down on my back to watch the sky. The sun was very hot but I had three eyes (sic) for protection against the glare. I observed the object for about 15 minutes. The object was very bright, with a reddish color. I noticed the jet at first, but very shortly I was able to pick up this object which seemed to be at about 20,000 feet or so. Its movement was very fast.

From 15 yards of altitude, I could see the object very clearly. It was stationary, then began to move. It moved at a very fast rate of speed and set side after way of the two heavy objects of my position. Its movement was very fast.

Based on the position of the object with relation to Tehran and count observed, which was constant, the city was at 371 feet altitude, I will say the object was moving at 500 miles per hour. I observed the object for one minute.

I immediately watched and obtained my binoculars and watched the sky for over an hour, but was unable to see any further objects.

I have upon observation verified this with my crew of flying. I reported this object to one of the air station officials in Tehran.
