H. WEATHER FORECASTER REPORTED A WEATHER BALLON FROM CHENNAULT AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA WAS REPORTED FOUND. WEATHER STATION PERSONNEL WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE FINDER OR LOCATION. NO INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE BALLON WAS CARRYING A LIGHT.

I. TENTH AIR DIVISION, AIR OPERATIONS CENTER, ENGLAND AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA AND 653 AC&W SQUADRON WERE NOTIFIED. THE AC&W UNIT MADE NO RADAR PICKUP OF AND OBJECT IN THAT AREA.

J. OBSERVERS SAW A JET AIRCRAFT MOVING IN A SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED. THE JET NOISE WAS PLAINLY AUDIBLE. OBSERVER BELIEVED AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING FROM OR TO ENGLAND AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA AT THE TIME.

K. THE PREPARING OFFICER IS IN THE WING INTELLIGENCE OFFICER OF THE 366 TACTICAL FIGHTER WING, ENGLAND AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA. HELICOPTER OPERATION WAS FIRST CONSIDERED BUT A CHECK OF LOCAL AIR FORCE AND ARMY CFT POLK, LA, HELICOPTER OPERATIONS SHOWED NO FLYING AT THAT TIME. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF A LIGHT FIXATION CAUSED BY A LIGHT IN TOTAL DARKNESS. THE FACT THAT THE OBSERVER CLAIMED TO HAVE GLANCED AWAY AT INTERVALS AND CORROBORATIONS BY HIS WIFE DISCOUNTS THE FIXATION THEORY. THE REPORT OF A WEATHER BALLON FINDING APPEARS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY SOLUTION AT THIS TIME.

L. NONE.
