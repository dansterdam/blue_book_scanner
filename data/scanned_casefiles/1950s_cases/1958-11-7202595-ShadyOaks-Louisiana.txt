1. WEATHER FORECASTER REPORTED A WEATHER BALLOON FROM CHENNAULT AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA WAS REPORTED BY WEATHER STATION PERSONNEL WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE FINDER OR LOCATION. NO INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE BALLOON WAS CARRYING A LIGHT.
I. TENTH AIR DIVISION, AIR OPERATIONS CENTER, ENGLAND AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA AND 653 AC&W SQUADRON NORTHWEST US AUTO RADAR-PICKUP OF THAT AREA.
J. OBSERVERS SAW A JET AIRCRAFT MOVING IN A SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE SIGHTERS OBSERVED THE JET NOISE WAS PRIMARILY AUDIBLE-OBSERVED AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING FROM OR TO ENGLAND AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA AT THE TIME.
K. THE PREPARING OFFICER IS TENTH AIR FORCE ENGLAND AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA. 
HELICOPTER OPERATION WAS FIRST CONSIDERED BUT A CHECK OF LOCAL AIR FORCE AND ARMY STAFF POLICY INDICATED OPERATIONS SHOWED NO FLYING AT THAT TIME. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF A LIGHT FIXATION CAUSED BY A LIGHT IN TOTAL DARKNESS. THE FACT THAT THE OBSERVED OBJECT APPEARED TO HAVE GLANCED AWAY THAT LENDS AND CORROBORATES BY HIS WIFE DISCOUNTS THE FIXATION THEORY. THE REPORT OF A WEATHER BALLOON APPEARS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY SOLUTION AT THIS TIME.
