10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object observed from C-47 that was tracking a Gopher Balloon. First appeared to be star-like, the object held a constant position next to the balloon where it seemed to take shape and increase in size until it was 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the balloon. Then it detached and traveled in level flight at high speed, emitting orange sparks. The C-47 was at 11,000' and the balloon at 70-100,000'. Shape was circular. Color. Milky white. Speed. Hover to high.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☒ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☒ Other: Gas from balloon
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

11. COMMENTS
White object observed in conjunction with balloon. Balloon scheduled for hr flight. Descended shortly after observation of object. Most probable cause was gas leaking from balloon. Flash attributed to disappearance and/or explosion of leaking gas. Color attributed to altitude and temperature of escaping gas.

INCIDENT 22 JANUARY 1951
HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE

On 22 January 1951, while participating in Project Gopher at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, we took off at about 5000 ft and proceeded to the balloon launching site at 10,000 ft MSL where we started tracking a balloon.

The balloon was set to maintain a 100,000 ft altitude for a period of about four hours. After tracking the balloon for about one hour or a southeast course at a point about 70 miles southeast of Holloman AFB, a tiny star-like object appeared next to the balloon. At this time Captain Spaulding of Photo Lab and Mr. McNeese of General Mills Corporation were noted.

The object held a constant position next to the balloon and appeared to be increasing in size. At this time its round shape and clear outline became more visible. After leaving the cockpit and observing the object from the astralobe, the object started separating from the balloon in a westward direction. At this time the object was about 1/2 to a half the size of the balloon. The object now appeared to be traveling in level flight at a very high speed. After about one minute it emitted a series of brilliant flashes of light at one-second intervals and disappeared from sight.

Holloman tower was called to verify if any other aircraft were in the area and when informed of the object, there was no reply.

The incident was reported to the project chief at Holloman AFB and his suggestion, Major Keith of Electronics Shi-Division was also contacted.

1. The following information is submitted per request from Lt Ruppert.

On 22 January 1951 the undersigned, [name illegible], and [name illegible] on Project Gopher, were tracking a balloon on Project Gopher. We had taken off from Holloman A.F.B., New Mexico in a C-47 type aircraft at 0900 EST. We pick up our balloon shortly thereafter and were tracking it in an easterly direction. About half way between Holloman and Salt Flat Texas, we noticed an object near our balloon. The balloon was at 70 thousand plus feet and we were flying at approximately 11 thousand feet.

The object was above and to the side of our balloon. How far above and to the side cannot be said because there was no reference. The object was about the size of the balloon. It was flat and round. The balloon was pear shaped. The object was a milky color.

As long as I saw the object, which was approximately 3 minutes, it maintained its position in relation to the balloon. We flew under the balloon and lost sight of it, and Mr. [name illegible] went back to the astro-dome position and watched it from there. They said that the object descended to the balloon and then after several bright flashes disappeared to the west.

A short time thereafter our balloon started to descend and landed near Salt Flat, Texas.

After landing at Holloman, we made a verbal report to the officials there.

Saucer Visiting Balloon?
2 Field Pilots Not Sure
Airmen Sight Object While On Mission
In New Mexico; AMC Officials Silent

Two Wright Field Officers added another chapter to the "Flying Saucer story" last night.

Capt. J. E. Cocker, of the All-Weather Flying Division, and Capt. E. W. Spradley, of the Aerial Photographic laboratory, claimed they "saw a strange object" in the sky while on a test mission recently.

They said they were flying in a C-47 at about 12,000 feet near Alamogordo, N. M. Their plane had taken off from Holloman Air Force base to track a large balloon sent up to take weather observations. The balloon was similar to the type used in "Project Skyhook" disclosed this week by the Navy.

Capt. Spradley described it as having a "milky color" when I noticed a strange object in the sky. It was flat and looked like a dime. It was a milky color. It wasn't doing anything, just hovering there near the balloon.

Hovored Near Balloon

"It appeared to hover next to the balloon for a while," and then it started to accelerate in speed. Just before it disappeared, I saw the brilliant flashes, like photo flashes, then it was gone."

Capt. Cocker said the civilian also saw something similar in the plane and the object.

"I saw something I never saw before," he said.

"It was perfectly round. But I don't know what it was. In a way it looked like a star without any twinkle, although it appeared a brilliant white."

A. F. Officers
Report Seeing
Flying Saucer

Two Wright-Patterson Air Force base officers Wednesday reported seeing a "strange object" in the sky over Alamogordo, N. M.

Capt. J. E. Cocker of the All-Weather Flying Division and Capt. E. W. Spradley of the Aerial Photographic laboratory while tracking a large weather balloon, reported the object.

Capt. Spradley described his experience following the balloon with a strange object almost in the sky. It was flat and looked like a dime. It was a milky color. It wasn't doing anything, just hovering near the balloon.

Capt. Cocker said: "I saw something I never saw before. It was perfectly round. But I don't know what it was. In a way the star without any twinkle, although it appeared a perfectly clear sun-like color.

The flyers estimated the object and balloon were "somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 feet."

It appeared to hover near the balloon and then it accelerated in speed. Just before it disappeared, I saw brilliant flashes, then it was gone."

Air Material Command officials said Thursday they had received no official reports from base officers and "do not take stock" in most such cases.

"As in most such cases, the observers were too far away to identify what they saw. How much can they know at a distance of more than 10 miles?" a spokesman said.

16 DEC 51

An Air Force Project named COSITE operating out of Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, has released a PO Note giving information for the first time describing in the view of Maj. James R. Dougherty, Chief, Guided Missiles Branch, ARDC, a possible method of locating guided missiles.

Although not necessarily a complete solution, two 12-kc sweeping frequencies were used in an experimental setup. These not be from Dayton, Ohio, were used in conjunction with two other frequencies from Wright Field, Ohio. A third individual frequency was also used in the two-mile and 16 mile tests. A significant will be incorporated in future tests.

Further data will be forthcoming when avail.

Returning AGOID 0540, info as desired fols:
Observations were made by 5 people, 1 white and
4 natives between hrs of 1700 AST on dates as fol:

approx 1740, 23 Jan. Missionary Swedish Covenant Church
(natives), 26 Jan between hrs 1700 and 1800. Jack
(native), 22 Jan and 25 Jan between 1700 and 1800.
(native), 24 Jan between 1700 and 1800. All
confirmed flare was 15 to 20 miles SSW approx 230 degrees from
Unalakleet just above horizon. Orange in color and would
disappear after 10 minutes duration and would not re-appear.
Intel estimates: 2 OSI agents this hqs made interrogation of
above individuals. It is the opinion of both agents that info
not too reliable. Mr. Hamilton of Alaskan Active Service
instigated wire and rounded up individuals concerned yet, had at no
time made any observations. CAA pers could not confirm having
seen any such flares. Lr. had more personal problems
(political) to discuss with some government agency, no concern
to military, which was his main concern in this incident. Agents
(law 30 miles SSW of Unalakleet), signed nothing unusual. People
queried were asked to rpt reoccurrence of sightings to this hqs.
