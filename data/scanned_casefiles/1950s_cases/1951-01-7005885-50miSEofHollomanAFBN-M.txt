The image appears to contain a photograph of what looks like a UFO or unidentified flying object. The text describes an incident that occurred on January 22, 1951, where a balloon was observed at an altitude of about 100,000 feet near Holloman Air Force Base. The object appeared to be metallic and was observed for several minutes before flashing brightly and disappearing from sight.

REPORT 22 JANUARY 1951

On 22 January 1951, while participating in Project Cosmos at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, we took off at about 0500 E and proceeded to the Holloman Launching site at 10,000 ft. where we started tracking a balloon.

At 0630, a balloon was at to attain an altitude of about 100,000 ft. As it was ascending, the balloon broke off at about 20,000 ft. and continued to rise, still maintaining a dark, metallic appearance. It appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed, far greater than the balloon itself. A small, star-like object appeared next to the balloon. At this time, collision insurance was notified.

The object continued to rise and soon passed out of sight. At the next and final observation, the balloon had descended to 60,000 ft. and was rapidly losing altitude. It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed. The object was not seen again.

Holloman Radar was called to verify if any other aircraft were in the area and when informed of the object, they state they had no information of any other objects in the sky.

The incident was reported to the Project chief at Holloman AFB and on the supervision, Major Kalil of Electronics Sub-Division was also contacted.

ROUTING AND RECORD SHEET

FROM: WCEFE-2

1. The following information is submitted per request from Lt Ruppert.
   On 22 January 1951 the undersigned, ___ and Mr. ___, Project engineers for General Mills Corp., were tracking a balloon on Project Mogul. We had taken off from Holloman A.F.B. on C-57 type aircraft in a north-westerly direction. About half way between Holloman and Salt Flat Texas, we noticed an object near our balloon. The balloon was at 70 thousand plus feet and we were flying at approximately 11 thousand feet.
   The object was above and to the side of our balloon. How far above and to the side I cannot say with any degree of accuracy. The object was round and silvery in color. It seemed to be stationary, and remained in sight for approximately 10 minutes. As long as I saw the object, which was approximately 10 minutes, it maintained its relative position to the balloon. We flew under the balloon and lost sight of the object.
   A short time thereafter our balloon started to descend and landed near Salt Flat Texas.
   After landing at Holloman, we made a verbal report to the officials there.

Saucer Visiting Balloon? 
2 Field Pilots Not Sure

Airmen Sight Object While On Mission 
In New Mexico: AWD Officials Silent

Two Wright Field officers added another chapter to the 
"Flying Saucer" mystery" the other night.

Capt. J. S. Cracker of the All-Weather Flying Division, and 
Capt. John T. Mazener of the Aerodynamical Laboratory, were 
flying in a C-47 about 50 miles southeast of Holloman Air Force 
Base, New Mexico, when they spotted an unidentified object in the 
sky.

They said they were flying at a C-47 at about 12,000 feet 
when Albuquerque, N.M., "ground control" notified them of a large 
balloon reported in that area. As they approached the area, they 
said, they saw a strange object which did not seem to be a balloon.

"It was traveling much faster than a balloon, and it was much 
smaller than a balloon," they said. "It was round and it seemed to 
be emitting a bright light.

"We tried to get closer to it to identify it, but it streaked off 
and we lost it. We don't know what it was. In a way, it looked like 
a star, but it wasn't acting like a star. It wasn't doing anything, just 
hovering."

Capt. Cocker said the object was at a much higher altitude than 
the balloon which was reported in that area. He said the object 
seemed to be traveling at a very high speed.

Officials at the All-Weather Flying Division and the 
Aerodynamical Laboratory at Wright Field declined to comment on 
the sighting.
