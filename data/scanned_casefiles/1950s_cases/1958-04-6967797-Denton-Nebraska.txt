The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a record card from Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The card is filled out with various details about an observation, including the date, time, location, type of observation, description of the objects, and conclusions. The text on the card is as follows:
