7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION        8. COURSE
THREE MINUTES                  One

9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One large light, so solid part visible, due to darkness to distinguish any shape or outline. This light moved very rapidly, stopped, turned 180 deg & went south rapidly. Observation was for approximately three minutes.

10. CONCLUSIONS
[X] Was Balloon                  
[_] Was Aircraft                 
[_] Was Astronomical               
[_] Was Satellite                 
[_] Was Insufficient Data for Evaluation

This sighting was probably caused by a searchlight off of an aircraft. This seems to be the most logical explanation.
