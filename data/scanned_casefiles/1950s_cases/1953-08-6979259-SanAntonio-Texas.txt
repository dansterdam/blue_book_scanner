STATEMENT

On Aug 5, 1953, I was working with Mr. [redacted] at the home of [redacted] on [redacted] off [redacted], San Antonio Texas. At about 1000 hrs Mr. [redacted] called my attention to an object in the air, which was unidentifiable to us. I verify that Mr. [redacted] gave me no undue distraction of the object, in that is let's no vague trend so cannot smoke and that there were no sound of motors.

I would say that the object was about two size of a 10 lb. hard can lid and that it moved back and forth cover a an area of about two feet.

I certify that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0315 hours 22 August 1953, the undersigned sighted, west of my house, 155 Packard Drive, about one-half mile away, a reddish brown light without reflector or sound moving south in an erratic up and down motion across the sky, at approximately 1500 to 2000 feet altitude.

The actual speed is unknown, but it seemed to move fairly slowly. It appeared to be larger than a star and resembled a star.

About 5 seconds after I sighted this object, I called my wife, Grace Foley, out of the house and we both had a visual observation of the object for approximately 30 seconds longer when it slowly disappeared behind the houses across the west, moving from south to east.

About 10 minutes later an aircraft was sighted flying a southwest path. He turned on his landing light which were easy to distinguish as landing lights. Also, he was in the heard. About 5 minutes after this aircraft was sighted, another was sighted flying from south to north, and this aircraft passed to west of home, and was also heard.

STATEMENT

I was called out of the house at approximately 5 seconds after 0015 hours on 22 August 1953, by my husband, James V. Foley, to see a strange light flying by the house. This light was a reddish brown and did not resemble an aircraft or part of an aircraft in any way. There was no sound. I watched this strange object for about 25 seconds until it disappeared from view behind the house next door. It traveled from north to south, then turned east.

Hydrographic Bulletin

METEOR

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. Mariners reporting their observations of these bodies are greatly assisting in this work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of observation as accurately as possible, together with the vessel's course and altitude, or by relation to fixed stars, or both.

Complicated observations on long-enduring trails and their direction of drift are of special importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

NORTH ATLANTIC
Chief Officer Francis Campbell of the British SS. Bembridae
Hill reports that on August 20, 1953, in lat. 40°00' N., lon. 40°30'
W., a brilliant body, traveling in an E. by S. direction was observed.

The first indication of any phenomenal occurrence was a bright green diffused glow on the superstructure of the ship, lasting for about 1 second. This green light was reflected from the sea directly beneath the traveling body.

The body, traveling extremely fast, coursed parallel to the surface of the sea, and disappeared into the clouds emitting a stream of sparks.

STATEMENT

On 5 Aug 53 while working at [illegible] base on [illegible], off [illegible], San Antonio Texas, I saw an unidentifiable object in the sky at about 1000 to 1015 hours. It appeared to be about the size of the bottom of a 9 2 tub and shined like silver. We saw no vapor trails or exhaust noise, and didn't hear any sound of motors. It just hung in the sky for about 5 or 6 minutes with a blue sky background.

We were looking due west, with sun in back of us when it suddenly disappeared.

I was standing about 20 feet from a side pole that I was erecting and was looking to see if it was straight. At an angle from my eyes, looking over a piece of pipe a foot from the top of a 35 ft. Gin pole, I spotted this object. I called my son and [illegible], the [illegible], as soon home we working, they all saw it.

It was approximately 6-8 miles away and there were no planes observed in the air.

I certify that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
