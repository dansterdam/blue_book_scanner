The following priority message received from source on 7 September 1950 by the Intelligence Division, Headquarters MATS, is quoted for your information:

"BN 1567, DTG 031632. Following forwarded for your information. At 052152 100 August 1951, DTG 031632. AF Base picked up blip on GCA scopes. Blip traveling estimated 40 to 60 MPH at estimated 5-mile ring where it paused for 30 seconds. Blip picked up on second scope revered to heading of approx 210° then to 140° and disappeared approx 9 miles range. Blip faint until reaching 5-mile range when became brighter and more distinct comparable to small aircraft. Possible atmospheric phenomena. No aircraft in GCA area at that time. No weather or radiosonde balloon verification during period. Two airmen reported sighting well qualified and very reliable.

"At approx 00242, 2 September 1950 Base picked up blip on scope at 5 miles off shore. At 0530Z same date GCA reported sighting blip just off shore, speed 60 miles per hour, cruising in area. Investigation both incidents made with negative results.

"AF approx 01302 2 September 1950 at Ernest Harmon AF Base on east end of runway, sighted silhouette of person between beach and self. When investigated and saw flash and felt hand burns, person then fired 4 rounds from 45 caliber pistol and 3 rounds from carbine with unknown results. Inflicted by .22 or .25 caliber jacketed slug. No powder burns. Search of area made with negative results. Although information on above sketchy possibility exists of tie-in between shooting of airman and GCA sightings. Additional information will be forwarded on sighting if and when received."

Object was round, black or some dark color, about the size of a barrel and resembled a large balloon. The three expressed the opinion that at first it was thought the object was some type a/c with only a portion of it distinct, however, as it started to ascend, they decided it was possibly a balloon or some object released from an a/c. When first observed the object was just off the water, within a few minutes it began to ascend until it appeared to be 15-20 ft above the water, then slowly to descend until almost on the water again. This rising and descending occurred until it disappeared. Each cycle of ascending and descending lasted approximately 40-60 seconds. The object was observed close to the surface for approximately 3-4 minutes before it started its last ascent and was in view for approximately 20 seconds.

AF FORM 112-PART II                 AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The Intelligence Officer, 1260th Air Base Group, Ernest Harmon AF Base, Newfoundland, has reported the 30 August 1950 sighting of an unidentified object near Sandy Point, Newfoundland, by three (3) Newfoundland native employed of the Water Transportation Section of Ernest Harmon AF Base. (The three (3) observers were 36 years old, 45 years old, 36 years old, employed for one and a half years (14)).

"The sighting was made from approximately two miles off Indian Head (46° 29'N, 56° 50' W). The object's position was approximately three miles southwest (46° 27' N, 56° 53' W) and approximately 1 to 1½ miles off shore.

"The crew sighted an object just off the water and was described by all three men as being round, black, or some dark color, about the size of a barrel and resembled a large balloon. The three expressed the opinion that at first it was thought the object was some type aircraft with only a portion of it distinct, however, as it started to ascend, they decided it was possible a balloon or some object released from an aircraft. When first observed the object was just off the water, within a few minutes it began to ascend until it appeared to be 10-15-20 feet above the water, then slowly to descend until almost on the water again. This rising and descending occurred a total of three times, then the object started to ascend and continued straight up until 15 disappears. The object was observed close to the surface for approximately 3-4 minutes before it started its last ascent and was in view from approximately 1650' to 1650'.

"The Water Transportation Officer, [redacted], rated all three men as very reliable, stating that all were quiet and truthful.

"At approximately 1910Z, 30 August 1950, Mr. [redacted] with the Kippens Bomber Station that an object, thought to be a submarine, had been sighted 3 miles off the shore of Kippens, Newfoundland at approximately 1700Z. The object was described as having the appearance of a barrel with a periscope, or long pole attached.

"At 1920Z, ARS dispatched a helicopter to reconnaitre the area from the base to Port au Port with negative results. The area around Indian Head was also checked with negative results.

"Questioning of the witnesses at Kippens at 2200Z, 30 August 1950, disclosed the following information:

[Remainder of text contains redacted names and details about witnesses]

"The object was described by all three men as appearing about the size of a dory and looked like a large target balloon with either a black (older) or brownish-yellow (other two) color. It was approximately 15 to 20 feet above the water and had a pole extending from its center to the water line and was traveling north-northeast at an estimated speed of 3 to 5 mph.

"The object was in sight approximately five minutes before it moved over the horizon. There was no smoke, exhaust noise, or marking evidence.

AF FORM 112-PART II                    AIR INTELLIGENCE UNCLASSIFIED REPORT

Intelligence Digests, HQ, MATS                                 IR-960-50        PAGE    -2976 1/2

"All three men have a limited education with no military experience.

"The association of the object with a large target balloon was due to the fact that the men were in an area where aerial gunnery practice was being conducted in the area during the 1600 war. No officer was able to investigate and the three men lost for shore leave following that there might be aerial gunnery conducted in the area.

"The object was observed momentarily from high ground on shore, but no significance attached to sightings until later after casual remarks to other persons and then it was decided that the incident should be reported to military authorities.

"A possibility exists that a weather balloon may have descended in this area, however, it is the opinion of weather personnel that none of the locally released balloons would be in the area. Only one radiosonde balloon was released that day (1600) and it was with a surprisingly 2° ± 1° at 8 kts. Ceiling balloon released and the radiosonde balloon all headed northeast after release until lost.

"Local weather sequences were as follows: 1) 1650E, 30 August 1950, ceiling 2,000 feet overcast, visibility 15 miles, pressure 29.89 inches high, temperature 587°, dew point 50°F. 2) 1652E, 30 August 1950, ceiling 3,000 feet broken, visibility 15 miles, wind west-northwest at 6 knots. 3) 1702E, 30 August 1950, ceiling 2,500 feet broken, visibility 15 miles, pressure 29.89 inches high, temperature 61°F, dew point 48°F, wind north-northwest at 7 knots.

"Control Tower and Operations report no aircraft in area at time of sighting. Three aircraft (a B-29, a TCA DC-3, and a KLM DC-3) were over field and smoked across the OCA layer prior to observation of the unidentified object."
