The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a Project 10073 record card from the Project Blue Book, which was a systematic study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. The record card contains information about the date, location, type of observation, duration of observation, brief summary of sighting, and conclusions.

Here is the text from the record card:
