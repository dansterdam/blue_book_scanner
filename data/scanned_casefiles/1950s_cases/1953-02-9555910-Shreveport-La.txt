26 March 1953

Dear Dr. Hynek:

We have been receiving your comments and evaluations on the work we have been sending you week by week and they have been very helpful. We are glad to say that we were notified to send back to you several copies of the items.

As stated in your last letter, correspondence of this work is good. I can't fathom why so many apparently good reports, when properly worked up, are fooled by Venus, but I can see why in many cool-headed cases.

We estimate that about 25 of our reports of January, February, and March reports can be attributed to this celestial body. We are comparing your conclusions with ours on the problem. You send down and in most cases, as I stated before, they answer up pretty well.

As far as follow-ups on the vehicle sightings are concerned:

(1) Port Austin, 17 February - Continued visual and radar - have asked them for an amplifying report. 125 degrees determine whether the radar pick-up and the visual sighting are actually good. The person involved has been asked to fill out Electronics Data Sheet which is set up for such sightings, and when it arrives ATIC radar specialists will evaluate it for possible radar interference, also of course, dew point races through our liaison with A.W. weather service. When all this needed information arrives we will place it together and try and evolve a conclusion.

(2) The Shreveport sighting of 27 February involves Sherman, Texas, 25 February case. First, will try our standard procedures as you suggested.

Concerning Dr. Hynek's proposed contract: We don't buy it either in its present form. I would like to get together with you and talk this over as we have done with Dr. Eplen of U.S.L. who, incidentally, thinks we can't do the whole thing. We are working on a suggestion. We talk the whole thing over with Hanel but I don't like this idea. In the first place, we know that one can't explain all sensor sightings by Venus, which is the case of his whole plan.
