Dear Dr. Hynek:

We have been receiving your correspondence and we have been giving it our careful consideration. As you know, we have been evaluating the UFO reports that have been submitted to us and we have been unable to arrive at any definite conclusions regarding them.

We estimate that about 95% of our sightings for 3 months, February, and March reported can be accounted for as having a probable explanation. In most cases, as I stated before, they amount to nothing.

(1) Port Aransas 17 February - Contraption visual and raid - have asked them for a visual and raid report so that we may evaluate their report. We have not as yet received the detailed information needed.

(2) The Shreveport, Louisiana - night of 27 February - policeman, Texas, reports a 3 second sight, but definite and could not explain. This report has been investigated.

In the previous cases, I would like to say that you and this office would appreciate it if you could inform us whenever you would help us in any of our approaches to cases. This cooperation is mutually beneficial and desirable to the project until a replacement can be found for the vacationing.
