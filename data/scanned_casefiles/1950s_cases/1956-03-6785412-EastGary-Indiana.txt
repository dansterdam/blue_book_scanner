10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Three round objects, one in the north, one northeast, and one in the east seen by a GOC observer during his tour of duty. The objects seemed to remain stationary and appeared to be alternating at irregular intervals the colors green, orange, and red. Seen through window glass of GOC post.

11. COMMENTS
ATIC Form 164 was completed by telephone with the observer by Flt 3-A, 4602d AISS, & forwarded to this headquarters. The observer tended to disbelieve that the sighting was generated by stars or planets due to the change in colors. When the observer went off of GOC duty the objects were still in sight & in the same positions. It is the opinion of this hq that source saw Jupiter and two stars (Probably).
