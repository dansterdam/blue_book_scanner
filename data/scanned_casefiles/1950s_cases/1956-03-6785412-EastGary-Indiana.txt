11. COMMENTS: Report 164 was completed by telephone with the observer by Lt S. A. Boehm, UFO-1. The observer added that the sighting was of objects that changed in color and brightness, which he felt were due to the change in position of the observer when the objects were off of GCI duty. The objects were still in sight when the observer went off duty.
