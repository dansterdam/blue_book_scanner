Source: Space Craft Digest, Fall 1958

ANOTHER REPORT of a sighting from people we are personally acquainted with is from Lebanon, Oregon. Mr. and Mrs. [illegible] (residents of the community) sighted a most amazing UFO locally the end of August of 1958 at 2:30 in the morning while they were up with their youngest child.

The "highly charged body" was about a size small than a full moon long between the and a nearby butte near Lebanon, Oregon. They watched this strange gry phenomenon for about 20 minutes. It was orange-yellow in color and "seemed to be just a large ball of fire". We certainly wager that this highly charged body would be of the type that "would cause the radio returns" but it is those same "balls of fire" that seem to move under intelligent control and so appear everywhere in the world.

Ball of fire, with a bluish-green and red tail at least 500 feet long" was sighted by a couple in Selma, Alabama, on Aug. 13th. The object was seen from nearby, and was heard to make a "sizzling" sound...

1. This Center checked with Flight Test Center, WADC, concerning test flights around Cleveland area. The ATI Center was informed that flight tests are conducted in protected area RL099, east of Dayton, and none in the Cleveland area.

2. Balloons are released from all over the United States, some small, some very large. The large balloons will travel thousands of miles from the launching site before coming down. Some of these launchings are unscheduled, and are so numerous as to preclude checking with all the airports that might release balloons.

3. A thorough check of the ATIC files failed to reveal any reports of unidentified flying objects in the Cleveland area on the 18th or 19th of August 1958.

Dear Senator Lausche:

I refer to your inquiry concerning the interest of Mr. Earl J. Neff of Cleveland, Ohio, in unidentified flying objects.

A thorough check of the Air Technical Intelligence Center files fails to reveal any reports of unidentified flying objects in the Cleveland area on the 18th or 19th of August 1958.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on the subject of unidentified flying objects, dated 6 October 1958.

This fact sheet clearly outlines the Air Force position with respect to UFOs.

Dear Mr [redacted]:

Thank you for your letter to the Secretary of Defense, dated 8 September, which was referred to this office for reply.

Without more specific information, we cannot make a definite conclusion as to the object which you observed. However, your description fits the appearance of one of the 130-series Jet fighters when the setting sun below the horizon reflects on the underside of the aircraft at high altitude. We should point out that a jet aircraft in a climbing position may appear to be moving very slow.

We have added your report to our files for reference in our continuing investigation of aerial phenomena, and we appreciate your interest.

Sincerely yours,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

ASTRONOMY

Mars Appears Late
The red planet Mars, steadily approaching nearer to the earth, will be the brightest object in the sky when it appears late in August evenings.

By JAMES STOKLEY

▶ THE RED PLANET Mars, shining more brilliantly than any other planet or star visible at the same time, will appear in the eastern sky late in August evening. This is the first time this year it can be seen before midnight.

Since last September, when it was farthest west, out on the opposite side of the sun, Mars has been drawing closer to the earth. From a distance of 84,500,000 miles on Aug. 1, it comes to within 64,000,000 miles on the site. During the autumn the approach will continue and it will be nearest Nov. 8, only a little more than 45,000,000 miles away.

Although the accompanying maps show the appearance of the evening skies in August, Mars is not shown. This is because they are prepared for about two months of standard time (add one hour for daylight saving), at the first of August, an hour earlier at the 15th and two hours earlier at the end of the month. Mars rises after these hours.

Even more brilliant than Mars is Jupiter, which acts, at the beginning of the month, about two hours after sunset. It, too, fails to get on our maps. However, it is in the constellation of Virgo, the virgin, the eastern part of which is shown low in the southwest, to the right of Scorpius, the scorpion.

One planet is shown on the maps. This is Saturn, farthest from either Mars or Jupiter, but equal to a first-magnitude star. It is in Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer, seen in the southwestern sky. Just below it is the constellation of Scorpius with the red star Antares.

(Vega) Most Brilliant Star

The most brilliant star of the August evening is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre, which stands directly overhead at the times for which the maps are drawn. Nearby, toward the south, it Aquila, the eagle, with Altair. Toward the east is Cygnus, the swan, in which Deneb is to be found.

Another bright star, second only to Vega, is in the west. This is Arcturus, in Bootes, the bear-driver, a reference to its proximity to Ursa Major, the great bear, of which the "big dipper" is a part. This figure is seen to the northwest in the lower part are the two pointers, whose direction leads to Polaris, the pole star, which is part of the little dipper, in Ursa Minor, the little bear.

The star mentioned, except Polaris, are all of the first magnitude, but some fainter ones are also seen, which in star groups easily identified.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

extending from Cassiopeia in the north, 
through Cygnus nearly overhead, down to 
Sagittarius in the south. It is hard to see 
from a city, in competition with city lights, 
but with a dark sky, out in the country, it 
is readily apparent. Even a pair of binocu- 
lars will show that it consists of a swarm 
of individual stars and they are most nu- 
merous in the direction of Sagittarius, where 
the Milky Way looks brightest. This, of 
course, is the direction of the galactic center, 
which is about 30,000 light years away.

Millions of Galaxies
Just as there are other cities, beyond the 
limits of your own, at various distances, 
so are there other galaxies, millions of them, 
in fact, scattered throughout the universe. 
One of the closest is just visible to the naked 
eye, on a dark night, in Andromeda. Its 
position is shown by a small "x" on the 
map.

Its distance is about 1,500,000 light years, 
so it is by far the most distant object that 
one can see with the naked eye.

In size the Andromeda galaxy equals 
ours. It may even be somewhat bigger. 
This represents a reversal of opinion among 
astronomers in recent years for they used to 
think it considerably smaller than ours. 
Then they found that the dimensions of our 
own had been overestimated, which partly 
removed the discrepancy.

Next they revised the distance scale for 
the other galaxies, and the one in Androm- 
eda turned out to be about twice as far 
as they had supposed. Therefore, to look 
the size that it does in the sky, it had to 
be twice as large.

Life in Space?
As we reach out farther and farther into 
space, with bigger and bigger telescopes, 
more and more galaxies come into view. 
Some, like the one in Andromeda, have 
a spiral structure, like a huge pinwheel. 
Others are shaped like a flat lens, and show 
few details of structure. A third class shows 
an irregular shape, with no particular form. 
These are the components of our universe: 
millions and millions of galaxies, each con- 
taining millions or even billions of stars.

A good proportion of these stars are 
probably accompanied by planets like those 
around the sun. Many of these planets may 
well be inhabited. It no longer seems that 
our earthly life is unique—or nearly so.
