Dear Sir:

Yesterday, on April 19th, about 1:20 P.M., while observing a vapor trail just west of Ft. Davis from horizon to horizon, and from northeast to southwest, a strange object which appeared to be floating just west of the Ft. Davis air field at Davis.

I at first thought it may have been a balloon released by the plane that made the vapor trail, but was not of a spherical shape like an ordinary balloon. The object appeared to be something solid, disc-shaped, and somewhat larger than the vapor trail itself. It was not glowing or giving off any light, but was much too high for such, but still appeared to continue the same motions and flight as the plane that had preceded it. The object then began to swing in an arc towards the north with great acceleration, and shortly afterwards seemed to pass over at about the same rate of speed as the plane had traveled.

It continued this erratic motion the speed became uncanny and much greater than any jet plane I have ever seen. All the while it appeared to be going about a mile in two seconds. At one time it appeared to the north beyond the Davis mountains, and then suddenly reappeared to the southwest beyond the Davis mountains, in about the same distance as first observed.

I shall appreciate your forwarding this information to proper authorities, if of importance.

Yours very truly,
[Redacted]
