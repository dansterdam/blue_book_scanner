Washington 25, D.c.

1. Reference rapid report A-3 TTX 66, dated 15 June 1951, the fo.l-
lowing information is forwarded.

2. A MIAT crew aboard a C-54 commanded by Captain ~____
of Westover Air Force Base, reported sighting two apparent contrails
while approaching Thule, Greenland on a routine ~june day" project flight 
atOloolz.,ii~1195L The firai' contrail was sighted an estimated 
sixty (60) miles south of r.hule while flying at 8000 feet. The second 
one was sighted nearly over Thule while_fp,.ying at approximately 4000 
fe~t during VFR let down while stil1 approaching Thule. Several crew 
members viewed the sightings to determine if lif'l!;er were actually contrails, 
or a result of unusal phenomena. Captain~tated that all were 
of the opinion that they were contrails but that they were not thoroughly 
familiar with white weather phenomena which might result in similar 
weather conditions. Because no position and no ground point were visible, 
Captain_was uncertain as to the altitude of the sightings but 
estimated them to be 30,000 to 40,000 feet above sea level.

3. At the time of the sightings, the temperature at 8000 feet was 
50°F and surface temperature at 'flule was reported to be 34°P with dew 
points of 29°F. If instrument readings were correct, the tempErature 
wouid indicate a slight inversion.

4. At the time of the sightings there were light, broken cumulus 
clouds at 3000 feet over the general area with high, thin stratus at 
14,000 feet to the left of course. The sky was clear in the vicinity 
of the signtrigs. Upper winds were reported at 20 knots from a northerly 
era1 head~e. Surface winds were 320' grid at 5 knots.
