SUBJECT: Intelligence Spot Report (Unclassified)

TO : Directorate of Intelligence

27 JUN 1951

1. Reference rapid report A-S WIK 36, dated 15 June 1951, the following information is forwarded.

2. A WB-29 crew aboard a C-54 commanded by Captain [redacted] of Westover Air Force Base, reported sighting two apparent contrails while approaching Thule, Greenland on a routine "Blue Jay" project flight at 01007, 10 June 1951. The first contrail was sighted at altitude of 20,000 feet and the second was sighted nearly over Thule while flying at approximately 4000 feet during VFR let down while still approaching Thule. Several crew members reported sighting contrails, but no visual sightings of a result of weather phenomena. Captain [redacted] stated that all were of the opinion that they were contrails but that they were not thoroughly convinced. No further action was taken.

3. At the time of the sightings, the temperature at 8000 feet was 50° and atmosphere temperature at Thule was reported to be 56°F with dew point of 28°. If instrument readings were correct, the temperature would indicate a slight inversion.

4. At the time of the sightings there were light, broken cumulous clouds at 3000 feet over the general area with high, thin stratus at 14,000 feet to the lot of course. The sky was clear in the vicinity of the sightings. Upper winds were reported at 20 knots from a northerly grid heading. Surface winds were 320° grid at 5 knots.
