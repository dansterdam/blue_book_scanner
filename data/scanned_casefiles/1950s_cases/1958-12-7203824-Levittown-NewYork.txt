On the evening of Sunday, Dec 14, 1958 I was taking photos of my family on the front lawn of our home about 7:00 p.m. A light snow had started falling a hour or so before. It was cloudy. There was no street or town visible. I had taken two fotos and was preparing to take a third when I observed this glowing well of light. At first it seemed to be a few degrees apart, but suddenly dewed on me to snap the shutter thus resulting in the picture I already forwarded. The object looked like a small moon(Our neighbor had it been visible mild haze in the nearby sky was a sort of covering, then after being in the horizon, seemed to fade away without ever changing position)

The following diagram fairly represents my position and the position of the object:

Gentlemen:

The attached photo sows taken by me with an unusual camera on the evening of 12-14-58 between 7-8 PM. A strange & unexplained light appeared in the house. I was flying such within 3 miles of the picture. After reading in the papers of strange lights in the sky this most interested me. I thought this practice may be of some public interest.

Respectfully yours,
