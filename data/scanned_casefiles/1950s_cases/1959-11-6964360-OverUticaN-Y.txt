Rad. yellow-white obj, size of pinhead at arm's length. Looked like spotlight. Disappeared suddenly, then reappeared much dimmer. Experienced pilots thought obj stationary until they attempted to close in & obj sped rapidly away.

The possibility exists that the obj was a balloon. However, the direction of movement was not reported, thereby precluding a valid conclusion.
