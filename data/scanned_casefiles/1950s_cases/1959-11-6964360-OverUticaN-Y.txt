The text extracted from the document is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 3 NOV 59
3. CATEGORY: 5. PHOTOS: □ Yes □ No
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: ONE
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 TO 15 MIN
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Rad, yellow-white obj, size of pinhead at arm's length. Looked like searchlight, disappeared rapidly away.
11. COMMENTS: The possibility exists that the obj was a balloon. However, the direction of movement was not of a balloon. The object traveled much too rapidly, precluding a valid conclusion.
