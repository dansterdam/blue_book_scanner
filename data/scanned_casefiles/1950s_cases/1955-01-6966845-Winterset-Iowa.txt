BL/Hq, 132d FB Gp:  Subject:  Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting
AISOP (1 Feb 55)
2nd Ind

HEADQUARTERS 4602D AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SQUADRON (AID), Ent Air Force
Base, Colorado Springs, Colorado                                25 FEB 1955

TO:   Commander, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force
       Base, ATTN: ATIC, Dayton, Ohio

In view of the fact that: (a) the sighting was for only 25 seconds; (b) it was not reported for our eight days after its occurrence; and (c) we have no flight immediately available to Des Moines, Iowa, a follow-up field investigation was not deemed worthwhile.

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2 dated 12 August 1954, the following information is hereby submitted:

a. Description of the object:

(1) A white light varying in intensity which seemed to be flashing at a set frequency.
(2) The size appeared to be equal to that of a dime.
(3) White
(4) One (1)
(5) N/A
(6) No trail or exhaust was visible
(7) No sound was heard
(8) No other pertinent features.

b. Description of course of object:

(1) The object made a head on pass with the observer's aircraft.
(2) The object came in from a 12 o'clock position level at 20,000 feet.
(3) The break we way was from the 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock position while slightly high and climbing rapidly to 35,000 feet.
(4) The object engaged by the observer aircraft contacted all breaks and turn reverses effectively by out turning or climbing, accompanied by great bursts of speed. It would appear in retrospect that the object was able to maintain contact with the observer aircraft by other than visual means due to the fact that the observer aircraft at times operated with all lights off.
