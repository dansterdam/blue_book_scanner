Encl: (1) Statement of [redacted], D., AC3, USN, 
and [redacted], ACAN, 
USNR, s[redacted] regarding subject

1. In conformance with instructions contained in reference (a) 
the following information is submitted.

2. Paragraph 2(d) of enclosure (1) of reference (a) is used 
as a guide.

(1) Object sighted was a white light, which flashed on 
and off in a manner similar to lights of commercial 
aircraft flying at night. It is believed to have 
been circular in shape. No other information could 
be given as to the shape, size, color, aerodynamic 
features, trail or exhaust, propulsion system, or 
sound. It is reported as having traveled at a high 
speed. The object or light made one light circular 
turn and disappeared traveling in a south-southeast-
erly direction at an estimated altitude of 5000 feet. 
Observers did somewhat the possibility of the object 
being a jet aircraft because the turn was too "tight" 
for an aircraft to make.

(2) Sighted at 2119R time and was observed for not more 
than forty-five (45) seconds.

(3) Observed visually, from control tower, Naval Air 
Station, Lakehurst, N.J., which is situated on top 
of Hangar No. 5, at a height of 265 feet. Binoculars 
were used as an aid to view the object.

IT CIRCLED VERY SUDDENLY, AND HEADED SOUTHWEST AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 5,000 FEET. FURTHER EXAMINATION WITH BINOCULARS REVEALED IT TO BE CIRCULAR OR OVAL IN SHAPE. IT BECAME ILLUMINATED AT REGULAR INTERVALS AND WAS TRAVELLING AT VERY HIGH SPEED. THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE IN NO MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS OF A MINUTE.

SKY CONDITIONS ON THE 27 OF DECEMBER AS REPORTED BY AEROLOGICAL OFFICE WERE CLEAR AND VISIBILITY OVER FIFTEEN MILES
