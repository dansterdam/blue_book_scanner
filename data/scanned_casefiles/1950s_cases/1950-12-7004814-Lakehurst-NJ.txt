1. In conformance with instructions contained in reference (a) the following information is submitted:

2. Paragraph 2(d) of enclosure (1) of reference (a) is used as a guide.

(1) Object sighted was a white light, which flashed on and off in a manner similar to lights of commercial aircraft flying at night. It is believed to have been at a great altitude. No contrails or exhaust of any kind were observed. Sound: Although no engine or propulsion system features were trail or exhaust, population estimate sound it did disappear at a high speed. The object or light made one tight circular turn and disappeared traveling in a south-southeast direction at an estimated altitude of 3000 feet. Opinion differs on the capability of the object for an aircraft to make.

(2) Sighted at 2119R time and was observed for not more than forty-five (45) seconds.

(3) Observed visually from control tower, Naval Air Station, Lakehurst, N.J., which is situated on top of Hanger No. 5, at a height of 265 feet. Binoculars were used as aid to view the object.
