Here is the text I can read from the document:

INFORMATION

127

[Some text appears to be partially illegible or cut off]

21

[Several lines of text are partially obscured or illegible]

The document appears to be a military or government information sheet with some handwritten markings and annotations. The number 21 is visible in the top right corner, and the word "INFORMATION" is stamped at the top of the page.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(illegible text at top of page)

(multiple lines of partially illegible text)

Note: Much of the text is difficult to read clearly, with many sections being partially or fully illegible due to the image quality and document condition.
