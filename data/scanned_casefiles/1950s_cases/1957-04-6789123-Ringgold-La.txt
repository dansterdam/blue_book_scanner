DO #9 24-208

6. On 3 May 1957, F. B. WILDER, Deputy Sheriff in charge of criminal records, Lincoln Parish Courthouse, informed the writer that he had no information concerning ROBERTSON.

7. On 3 May 1957, records made available by BETTY B. KENDALL, Clerk of City Court, contained no information concerning [redacted]

AT RINGGOLD, LOUISIANA

8. Mrs. [redacted], Route 1, was interviewed by the writer on 3 May 1957. McCOY stated that a man had awakened her husband and her in the early morning hours of 25 April 1957 and asked her husband to accompany him to the area behind their house where he stated he had seen a large red object settle in the trees from the sky; that her husband refused because it was raining very hard at the time. [redacted] informed the writer that her husband, who was not at home at time of interview, had looked for the object from the house, but did not see anything. [redacted] said her husband had expressed curiosity about this matter and was going out in the area and look around at the first opportunity but had not yet attempted a search as recent rains had flooded the ground upon which the object was reported to have landed. [redacted] took the writer's name and phone number and agreed to call if anything was found in that locale. The writer observed the terrain from a rise on the ground adjacent to the [redacted] home, but could detect no unusual feature in the area upon which the object was reported to have landed. A detailed search on foot was not considered practical because of the flooded condition in that area.

9. On 3 May 1957, [redacted] Night City Marshal, stated in interview that a man had reported seeing an unusual object out in Highway 15h early in the morning of 25 April 1957, but he had not recorded this person's name and had not investigated. He related that he heard a jet aircraft fly over the town about 0130 hours the same night and associated the sighting with the exhaust flare of the aircraft. [redacted] informed the writer that his office had received no other reports of anything unusual being observed in that vicinity.

10. [redacted], Work Unit Conservationist, Soil Conservation Service, was interviewed by the writer on 3 May 1957. [redacted] displayed a large aerial photographic grid map of the section in which the object was reportedly sighted and pin-related the location as described by [redacted]. [redacted] stated that he owned some land near that location and had been out there since 25 April 1957, but had not observed anything unusual. [redacted] took the writer's name and phone number and stated that he would instruct personnel in his department to be on the lookout for anything unusual in that area and would call the writer if anything was found. According to the map grid, the cross of trees in which the object was reported to have landed was four and one-half (4½) miles west of Ringgold, Louisiana, one-half mile south of Louisiana State Highway 154.

KYLE, Base Operations Officer, was furnished information to be reported by his office in accordance with Air Force Regulation 200-2 and contained in paragraphs 3 and 5, above.

Contact with the Climatology section of the 3rd Weather Group indicates that this sighting was possibly caused by tornado, illuminated from theirby descending cumulonimbus cloud. Slowly, attempt to obtain weather information which would support this hypothesis were without result, since the weather stations at Ft A73 do not retain records past 60 days.

The contents of this letter are set forth as follows:

"Ruston, La
April 27th

"Dear Sir:

"I would like to tell you about something I saw at 2:30 o'clock Wednesday morning - April 25th. I had gone fishing to the dam at Lake Bistineau. A storm came up with terrific lightning and I decided to go to Ringgold, La. until morning. Six miles from Ringgold I was driving slowly because of the torrential rain and as I started up a hill I noticed a huge thing in the sky just ahead. It was shaped like a half moon - like this"(drawing). "It was red like blood and I stopped the car and rolled the window down and could see it more clearly. It slowly drifted down and settled in a grove of trees approximately a half mile away. I couldn't estimate the size until I saw the trees and it covered several of them. It continued to glow and it tested on them. I rushed to the top of the hill and aroused a family. I asked the man in the house to go over to it with me but he refused because of the down pour of rain.

"My wife said I should report it to the proper authorities so if you are interested, contact me. I believe I can take you to it as I tried to mark the spot.

"Respectfully yours
Manager
Ruston, La

5. Mr. J. E. LUMLEY, Meteorologist at Shreveport, Louisiana, office, U. S. Weather Bureau, was interviewed telephonically on 2 May 1957.
