On the night of the 16th of July, at approximately 10:00 P.M., I saw a light which appeared to be a star that was moving and blinking. It travelled from the west to the eastern direction in a zig zag motion. It stopped abruptly. Strange lights remained there for about 2 minutes and then it increased altitude and disappeared.

On the 15th of July, at approximately 11:00 P.M., I saw a little circle-like shape that started from the western and proceeded to the northeast moving altitude.

A/2c L, 3/Set. Eugene L. Chaffee, AP 576-01-167 (Operations Specialist) and A/2c C.L. Ackroyd, AF 11-66-52 (Operations Specialist) reported the following information on an unidentified flying object:

At 2210 local, 31 July 1952, while enroute to their living quarters after a briefing session, the witnesses observed an unidentified object to the north of Kadena Air Base. The object was moving straight down, but its course changed erratically thereafter, finally moving off to the north.

As it again moved across the sky, it picked up considerable speed and left behind it a trail of clouds in the sky that might have caused a reflection or refraction of light.

The object appeared to be round, with little depth, and its altitude was unknown. The object disappeared from view through the clouds and was not seen again.

KADENA AB OKINAWA [ILLEGIBLE] This report is in response to [ILLEGIBLE] message requesting information concerning a radar observation of an unidentified flying object. The following details are the result of an investigation conducted by this headquarters:

On 7 September 1952, approximately 1130 hours, radar operators at the Kadena Air Force Base radar site observed an unidentified target on their radar scopes. The object was tracked for approximately 3 minutes and was estimated to be traveling at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet and at a speed of 300 to 400 knots. The object was intermittently tracked until it disappeared from the radar screen.

Visual observation of the object was not possible due to overcast weather conditions at the time. No other confirming radar or visual contacts were reported in the area.

After careful analysis of the radar data and a thorough investigation, no conclusive explanation for the unidentified target could be determined. The observation was reported through channels in accordance with current directives.

Kadena, Okinawa 7 July, 1952
My visual observation at about 2145 on 7 July, 1952, in Kadena, Okinawa. While on a routine night flight in a T-6 aircraft, I observed a luminous object which appeared to be stationary. The object was not a star or planet as the night was clear and there were no other similar lights visible at the time. The object appeared to be at high altitude and did not resemble any type of known aircraft. I kept the object under observation for approximately 2 minutes before it seemed to fade away into the distance. I was unable to determine the exact size, shape or altitude of the object, but it appeared to be moving very rapidly when it disappeared from sight. I have had considerable experience in night flying and am familiar with various aircraft and celestial phenomena, and this observation did not resemble any known type of aircraft or celestial body that I am familiar with.

[Handwritten text]
The object observed was described as a round bright light, approximately six inches in diameter, Hovering about 50 feet above the ground. The object remained stationary for approximately 20 seconds before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight. No sound was reported during the observation. The weather was clear at the time of the incident. The sighting was made by two military witnesses who were familiar with aircraft and reported the incident to their superiors. The object's movement and lack of any sound or trail were inconsistent with conventional aircraft. An investigation was conducted but no explanation for the sighting was determined. The incident was deemed unexplained.

It also notes that "the white light was observed for only a brief period." The report is classified as UNCLASSIFIED.
