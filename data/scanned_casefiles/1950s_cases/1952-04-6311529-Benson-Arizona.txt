3307TH TRAINING SQUADRON (CONTRACT FLYING)
MARANA AIR BASE
Marana, Arizona

15 April 1952

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object
TO: Whom it May Concern

On 3 April 1952, I landed T-6D number 406 at the Benson, Arizona airport. Approximately 0745 for the execution of a 45 minute solo student aerial navigation to the company of Marana Air Base. 

Shortly after taxiing into position for the best observation of aircraft which would be turning over Benson airport and shutting down my engine, I saw what appeared to be a bright star in the minature of the airport approximately 100 yards east of the hangar and facing a direction of 255 degrees.

At approximately 0805, Mr. C., who was assigned the position of patrol, landed his T-6D aircraft and taxied in close proximity to my aircraft and parked facing in the opposite direction.

With my radio on and remaining seated in the front seat of my aircraft, I was awaiting the return of the students when Mr. C. called my attention to a bright object which appeared to be of a bright star and was prominent enough so that one's attention was drawn to it. In other words, there was no necessity to scan to relocate the object. At this time, my attention was called to this object which I visually observed for approximately seven minutes.

Mr. C. pointed out the fact that it was still there. I impressed me as being rather cold that any airborne object could maintain the same position for this length of time. It occurred to me to take a fix on this object in relation to the top of the canopy. The reading of this fix was 0823 (I time checked with the tower before take-off from Marana) and the object was approximately two and one-half inches above the canopy when I was centered in the seat.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a written document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. 

The text of the document is as follows:

During this time Mr. and Mr. had been drawn to the object. At approximately 0830 Mr. Logan with him by radio and I believe he claimed to have climbed to 12,900 ft, the object at that time from 30,000 to 40,000 ft. Mr. then descended and landed again at Benson.

During this time, and until it disappeared, I kept talking sights of this object and it never moved, the slightest fraction in relation to the canopy of my aircraft, which during this time, had not moved.

At 0914 Mr. who had been an intent observer of this object, walked to a position at the right wing tip. This qualified and took a position at the right wing tip. This qualified and took a position at the flight wing tip. This disappeared from observation in approximately fifteen seconds. When he reached this new position he remarked that the object had disappeared. Two or three of the students had also noticed the object while passing over Benson.

During the time of timed observation, from 0823 to 0914, this object did not change size, position nor intensity and vanished completely in approximately 15 seconds.

APPENDIX III

Benson, Arizona - 3 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 3 April 1952, at 1915 MST, three civilian AF pilot instructors and several other people observed an object from the Benson, Arizona, airport. The object was about the size of a bright star but was considerably brighter. It was observed (i.e. not necessary to scan the sky to find it).

At 1823 MST, one of the instructors took a fix on the object by sitting in a 2255 and indicating to one of the students the location of the object, which he believed had been sighted previously. The object disappeared. The object did not move during the 21 minute period. How the object disappeared is not known as one of the observers lost attention while attempting to take a sight on the object for about 15 seconds and when he looked up the object was gone.

One of the instructors flew a T-6 up to 12,500 ft. in an attempt to better observe the object, however, there was no definitive change in the size or appearance of the object.

Several cadets flying T-6's in the area also observed the object.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION
The excellent foreground detail of the instructor's report is to be continued. The analysis of the object has eliminated the possibility of it being a balloon, but other conventional explanations have not been ruled out. In addition, the object was shown to be moving at a rapid rate. No determination was made that there were no balloons in the area.

It is possible that the object was a bright planet. This is doubtful, however, since it would have to move some in 51 minutes.

The approximate elevation of the fix has been requested. In the original report it was given as "two inches above the canopy". This angle will depend on height of the pilot, height of seat, etc. When this information is received, additional bodies checked.

III. CONCLUSIONS
Pending.

The recently noted facts on record and Benson incident indicate rather positive indications that the sightings by several responsible observers on 9 April 52 could have been of some conventional airborne vehicle which, however, exhibited unusual characteristics.

3307TH TRAINING SQUADRON (CONTRACT FLYING)
MARANA AIR BASE
Marana, Arizona

15 April 1952

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object

TO: 30:

On 3 April 1952, Squadron II, Class 52-C, was assigned a triangular cross-country navigational flight, vis.: Marana - Winslow - Gallup - El Paso - Marana. Each student was required to follow a specific course and to report observations at checkpoints and turns, as well as any unusual occurrences to the control tower and instructor for the purpose of acting as radio communication center, checking each student's flight plan, etc. One aircraft was to be used in the training, and the instructor was to be in the area in the event one of the cadets missed the turning point. This aircraft consisted of the Patrol Ship.

By duties this date consisted of flying the Patrol Ship at the Marana airport and approximately at 0515, soon after I landed, one of our cadets flew over at an altitude of approximately 15,000 ft. and called in a radio message giving his ship's position. I immediately looked up and observed this object which was moving in a northern direction. It appeared as a bright, stationary object, and upon positive identification it was requested to turn left to right (to do not move directly) and we reported this incident by vision. This procedure necessitated our vision to be constantly directed upward.

One of our instructors, spotting an object in the sky and directed attention to all his students as it was a brilliant, glowing white and rather fast, and would guess to be at an altitude of more than 50,000 ft. It was not exactly round, but rather oval in appearance.

I watched it for about thirty or forty minutes, and felt it familiar that it did not move, but rather hovered in that same spot where it had been first observed.

A cadet by the name of flew over and remarked that he could not distinguish it, and the instructor directed him to fly towards it. This he did not care to do. The object then appear to fly off.

As this incident occurred so closely as closely as possible, so I took off and climbed to an altitude of 13,500 ft. I did not have oxygen. At this altitude the object did not look larger. It was more brilliant because the sky was clearer and blue. I flew around for about 20 minutes which the country operations then descended and landed.

After a little time, I asked if I could see the object. I looked upward, and could not see it as the object had disappeared.

- page 22 -

The image contains a handwritten sketch or illustration of what appears to be a flight instructor or some sort of aerial vehicle. There is no photograph present in this image.

It is the opinion of this individual that the above described object could have been a great deal higher than I have expressed in this report. My judgment as to height is naturally based upon some known size of objects I am familiar with. I know what an aircraft looks like.

This object could have been any height from the earth's surface, all depending on its size. Therefore, my guess as to altitude would be incorrect.
