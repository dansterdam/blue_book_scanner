3307TH TRAINING SQUADRON (CONTRACT FLYING)
MARANA AIR BASE
Marana, Arizona

15 April 1952

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object
TO:     Whom it May Concern

On 3 April 1952, I landed T-6D number 406 at the Benson, Arizona airport at approximately 0745 for the execution of ground control" for student cross-country flights. I was in the company of [redacted], who is also a civilian instructor at Marana Air Base.

Shortly after taxiing into position for the best observation of aircraft which would be turning over Benson airport and shutting off my engine, we were joined by Mr. [redacted], manager of the airport. The position of my aircraft was in the NW corner of the airport approximately 100 yards east of the hangar and facing a direction of 255 degrees M.

At approximately 0805, Mr. [redacted] who was assigned the position of patrol, landed his T-6D aircraft and taxied in close proximity to my aircraft and parked facing in the opposite direction.

With my radio on and remaining seated in the front seat of my aircraft I was awaiting radio transmission from the students when I was called to a bright object which appeared to be the size of a bright star and was prominent enough so that one's attention was drawn to it even though attention might be distracted momentarily. In other words, there was no necessity to scan to relocate the object.

At the time my attention was called to this object I thought nothing of it but when approximately six or seven minutes later, Mr. [redacted] pointed out the fact that it was still there, it impressed me as being, rather odd that any airborne object could maintain the same position for this length of time. It occurred to me to take a fix on this object in relation to the top of the canopy and take note of the time, which I did. The time was 0823 (I time checked with the tower before take-off from Marana) and the object was approximately two and one-half inches above the canopy when I was centered in the seat.


- page 2 -

During this time Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] attention had been drawn to the object. At approximately 0830 Mr. Logan took off to see if he could get a better look. I kept in touch with him by radio and I believe he climbed to 13,500 ft. (elevation of Benson airport is 3500 ft.). He reported he could see it slightly better, but estimated its altitude at from 30,000 to 40,000 ft. Mr. [redacted] then descended and landed again at Benson.

During this time, and until it disappeared, I kept taking sights on this object and it never moved, the slightest fraction in relation to the canopy of my aircraft, which during this time, had not moved.

At 0914 Mr. [redacted] who had been an intent observer of this object, walked from a position on the right side of the fuselage and took up a position at the right wing tip. This change of position took approximately fifteen seconds. When he reached this new position he remarked that the object had disappeared. I checked, using my sighting reference and found the object had vanished. Two or three of the students had also noticed the object while passing over Benson.

During the time of timed observation, from 0823 to 0914, this object did not change size, position, nor intensity and vanished completely in approximately 15 seconds.

APPENDIX III
Benson, Arizona - 3 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On 3 April 1952 at 0815 MST, three civilian AF pilot instructors and several other people observed an object from the Benson, Arizona, airport. The object was about the size of a bright star but was prominent enough to continuously observed (i.e., not necessary to scan the sky to find it).

At 0823 MST, one of the instructors took a fix on the object by sitting in a T-6 and sighting across the canopy with the aircraft on a magnetic heading of 255° at the time. Fixes were taken at intervals until 0914 at which time the object disappeared. The object did not move during the 51 minute period. How the object disappeared is not known as one of the observer's attention was distracted for about 15 seconds and when he looked up the object was gone.

One of the instructors flew a T-6 up to 13,500 ft. in an attempt to better observe the object, however, there was no relative change in the size.

Several cadets flying T-6's in the area also observed the object.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION

The excellent forethought of the instructor to take continual fixes on the object has eliminated the possibility of the object being an aircraft or balloon since no motion was observed. In addition, an investigation has made and it was determined that there were no balloons in the area.

It is possible that the object was a bright planet. This is doubtful, however, since a planet would appear to move some in 51 minutes.

The approximate elevation of the fix has been requested. In the original report it was given as "two inches above the canopy". This angle will depend on height of the pilot, height of seat, etc. When this information is received, a nearly exact fix can be obtained and known astronomical bodies checked.

III. CONCLUSIONS

Pending.

Air Force Men
Sight Huge
Flying Saucer

BENSON, Ariz. April 4 (U.P).-
Two Air Force pilots said today
they watched for an hour as a
huge oval-shaped object, possibly
five or six times the size of a B-29
bomber, hovered at about 55,000
feet above them.

Chick Logan and C. M. Jasper,
both veteran flight commanders
from Marana (Ariz) Air Force
Base, saw the object from the air.
Flight Instructor Paul Wilker-
son, Tucson, and Skeet Taylor,
owner of a local airport, said
they saw it from the ground.

Davis-Monthan Air Force Base
at Tucson said some B-38s were
flying in the Penzon area at an
altitude of 40,000 feet.

Logan said, however, it did not
have wings.

The sky was bright blue, he
said, "and the object stood out
like a sore thumb. I couldn't go
any higher than 14,000 feet because I had no oxygen with me."

"The object was bright and
shone like polished aluminum.
I've been flying 25 years and
never saw anything like it. It
was weird."

Wilkerson said it was too large
for a weather balloon.

3307TH TRAINING SQUADRON (CONTRACT FLYING)
PARANA AIR BASE
Parana, Arizona

15 April 1952

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object

TO:     Whom it May Concern

On 3 April 1952, Squadron 11, Class 52-G, was assigned a triangular cross-country navigational flight, viz., Parana - Winkleman - Benson - Sell - Parana, Arizona. Each of the above Arizona cities represented a turn - After turning point there was assigned a team of Instructors for the purpose of acting as radio communication center, checking each cadet as he flew over. One aircraft was held in readiness to patrol the area in the event one of the cadets missed the turning point. This aircraft was termed the Patrol Ship.

By duties this date consisted of flying the Patrol Ship at the Benson, Arizona turning point. I landed at Benson Airport approximately at 0315. Soon after I landed, one of our cadets flew over at an altitude of approximately 10,000 ft and called in over the radio, giving his ship number, name, and that he was enroute to the next turning point. For positive identification he was requested to turn left or right (I do not remember exactly) and was spotted this aircraft by vision. This procedure necessitated our vision to be constantly directed upward.

My [redacted], one of our instructors, spotted an object in the sky and directed our attention to it. It was a bright, silvery object, hanging motionless in the sky at an altitude I would guess to be somewhere above 50,000 ft. It was not exactly round, but rather oval in appearance.

I watched it for about thirty or forty minutes, and felt it peculiar that it did not move, but rather hovered in that same spot where it had been first observed.

A cadet by the name [redacted] flew over and [redacted] directed him to the object, asking if he could see what it was. "It" looked like a flying saucer.

At this time I decided to observe the object as closely as possible so I took off and climbed to an altitude of 13,500 ft. I did not have oxygen. At this altitude the object did not look larger. It was more brilliant because the sky was clearer and bluer. I flew around for about five minutes with the canopy open, then descended and landed. The object was still there in the sky.

After a little time, [redacted] asked if I could see the object. I looked upward, and could not. Then [redacted] and the airport manager looked and it was obvious that the object had disappeared.


- page 22 -

It is the opinion of this individual that the above described
Object could have been a great deal higher than I have expressed in
this report. My judgment as to height is naturally based upon some
known size of objects I am familiar with. I know what an aircraft looks
like at certain heights.

This object could have been any height from the earth's surface,
all depending on its size. Therefore, my guess as to altitude and size
could be incorrect.
