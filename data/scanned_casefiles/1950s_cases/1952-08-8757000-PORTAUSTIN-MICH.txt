AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

754th ACGW Sqdn, Port Austin, Mich.                    PAGE    2    OF    2

1. The following unusual radar targets were observed by personnel of the 754th
ACGW Squadron:

    a. The radar images appeared to be one aircraft. The size of the images on
    the radar scope was estimated to be three miles long and one half mile wide, with
    speeds in excess of 1200 knots. The radar tracks, as plotted by this station, are
    displayed on inclosure #1.

    b. The first object was observed at 0719Z, 6 August 1952; five flights were
    seen during the period. The last observation was at 0752½Z, 6 August 1952 (Reference
    incls #1 and #2).

    c. The electronic equipment employed at time of observance was a AN/FPS-3.
    The location of the equipment is Port Austin, Michigan; Longitude 83° W, Latitude
    44° 02' 30" N - Goerof Grid 0202. Antenna elevation of station is approximately
    576.66 feet Mean Sea Level. Frequency is 1295 megacycles.

    d. The object's radar image was initially detected at 0240°, 140 nautical
    miles from the station - Goerof Grid JB 1510 at 0719Z on a 200° heading and tracked
    to a point at 0240° - 105 miles Goerof Grid HA 5535. Track number 2 was detected
    at 0250 - 160 miles from the station - Goerof JA 3025 at 0723Z on a 200° heading
    and tracked to a point 0300 103 miles - Goerof JA 0530. Track number 3 was detected
    at 0640 157 miles from the station - Goerof Grid KA 0833, at 0747Z on a 050° heading,
    and tracked to a point 200 miles - Goerof Grid HA 1315, Track four was detected at
    0746Z on a heading of 050° and tracked to a point 200 miles from the station - Goerof
    Grid 2010 IB (Reference Incl. G, Overlay of Tracks and Incl. Radar Logs).

    e. The object is believed to have been at an altitude of over 30,000 feet.
    Calibration charts were used to obtain this estimate as no height finder equipment
    is available at this station.

    f. The following officer and airmen observed the reported tracks:
    [Names redacted]
    1st Lt. [redacted], Senior Controller
    [Name redacted], Technician
    S-SGT [Name redacted], Radar Maintenance

    g. The weather and wind conditions at the time of observation are extracted
    and attached as Inclosure #6.

    h. No intercept action was attempted.

    i. The only local traffic during the period was a Trans-Canadian Airlines
    DC-4, Flight 9, which was plotted at 0754Z at JQ 1540. This flight was on a northwest
    heading with destination Sault Ste Marie.

    j. The above listed personnel are highly conscientious and reliable
    portions to maintenance personnel with approximately two years experience in their
    respective fields. (References Incls #3, #4 and #5, Narrative statements of observers).

On the 6th of August, 1952, at 0732 an unidentified target was observed on our radar scopes in the vicinity of Corn Bay, Ontario. This blip had the appearance and size of a multi-engine aircraft, but manner of flight and excessive speed was not characteristic of normal plots handled by this station.

The above phenomenon caused us to plot this target and notify ADCC of same. Radar maintenance man on duty at the time did not believe that the blip was caused by interference from adjacent stations.

The target when first observed was on a 200° heading into our station, and fixed within a range of 70 miles. It then reappeared at a range of 30 miles on an outbound course of 350°. Speed was estimated in excess of 800 knots. At the time of last detection, the target was at a range of 200 miles.

At 0712, on the 6th of August 1952, an unknown target appeared on our radar scopes. The initial sighting was located northeast of our station near Gore Bay radio, at a range of 130 miles. Two subsequent plots established a track on a heading of 200 degrees, with a speed estimated at 300 to 1200 knots. This track did not have the appearance of a track normally plotted by this station. ADDC was notified and the information was passed on to SAGE.

The target faded at a range of 70 miles, and reappeared on a heading of 50 degrees. Radar operators plotted the track to maximum range, on the same reading, and at the same speed mentioned above.

The entire maintenance crew on duty at the time witnessed the incident, and did not believe the target to be interference from another station.

Control Technician


- page 9 -

On the morning of August 6, at approximately 0200 hrs, I observed on the radar scope what seemed to be targets traveling at very high speeds, estimated to be well above eight hundred knots an hour.

These targets were painting at a slight angle, not perpendicular to the sweep which is abnormal and would lead one to believe that the targets were caused by interference from another radar set. If it was interference, it was not like any that I have ever seen on this radar set.

The returns looked very much like ordinary targets except for the slight angle at which they were painting. I would say that if these targets occurred between this station and another station which was transmitting on a frequency within two megacycles of our transmitter frequency, they could be definitely classified as interference.

However, since these returns were seen traveling in two different directions, at least thirty degrees apart, and it is improbable that there are two more radar sets within our range transmitting on the same frequency, I would say that these returns were caused by some other phenomenon other than interference.

PERU                                                             DATE 21 JUN 1948

SUBJECT: Air Intelligence Information Report
REPORT OF: Unidentified Flying Objects
PLACE OF REPORT: Lima, Peru                 DATE OF INFORMATION: 6 August 1952     EVALUATION: B-2
PREPARED BY (Officer): Col Ralph L. Browne, Air Attaché                SOURCE: Lima press

REFERENCE: B-2-52, 21 Aug

SUMMARY:

On 5 August 1952 a Panagra pilot, Captain [redacted], reported a formation of (3) flying discs over the sky course between Lima and Callao (about 30 miles north of Lima) at an altitude of approximately 3000 feet. The time of the sighting was 17:15 AM EST, coinciding with a sighting of similar phenomena near the town of Chala.

COMMENTS:

This account appears to be more authentic than the one reported on 4 August (see 13-20-C2). However, the fact that a similar sighting was reported at the same time in Callao (approximately 20 miles south of Lima). This sighting, together with the 4 August sighting, culminates considerable interest shown by the local press in "flying saucers" an interest which has intensified since 17 July, paralleling similar publicity in the States.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: ATIL Office, D/I PSAF                                Report No. TR-35-52                Page 1 of 1

Statement of 1st Lt. Wesley R. Holdar

At 0000I, I was scrambled to investigate an unidentified object reported by a control tower operator at Handa. The object was reported to be in the Tokyo Bay area in an orbit to the standard at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet. I observed nothing of an unusual nature in this area however at 0016I vectored by Hi Jinx on a heading of 320 degrees and directed to look for a bogey at 1100 o'clock in m.i.a. Lt. Jones made radar contact at 10 degrees port at 6000 yards. The point moved rapidly from port to starboard and disappeared from the scope. I had no visual contact with the target. Soon after this contact the search was continued. I continued to search the Tokyo Bay area independently until 0126. The weather was .3 to .4 cloud covered at an estimated altitude of 11,000 feet with exceptional visibility of 60-70 miles. The only known air traffic at this time was a C-54 in the pattern at Handa and another C-54 over Johnson about 30 minutes later.

State of 1st Lt. Aaron M. Jones

At 0000I, Lt. Holder and I were scrambled to investigate an unidentified target over Tokyo Bay. Upon becoming airborne we immediately took up a heading for Tokyo Bay. At 0009 Hi Jinx reported a target at our 9 o'clock position. Visual contact was made at 0010 with this target and identified as a C-54. We then started a starboard search orbit under GCI control south east of Handa Air Base. At 0015 Hi Jinx gave us a vector of 320 degrees. Hi Jinx had a definite radar echo and gave us the vector to intercept the unidentified target. At Hi Jinx estimated the target to be at 11 o'clock to us a range of 4 miles. At 0016 I picked up a radar contact at 10 degrees port, 10 degrees below at 6,000 yards. The target was rapidly moving from port to starboard and a "lock" on" could not be accomplished. A turn to starboard was initiated to intercept target which disappeared onscope in approximately 90 seconds. No visual contact was made with the unidentified target. Hi Jinx was then contacted and they were unable to give us another vector because they also had lost radar contact with the unidentified target. We continued our search over Tokyo Bay under Hi Jinx control. At 0033 Hi Jinx released us from scrambled mission. The only other aircraft interested during this mission was at 0100, This aircraft was identified as a C-54, on course of 350 degrees altitude 5,000 feet, and 180K. We noticed nothing of unusual nature from this time until we landed at 0120.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2330 hours, 5 August 1952, while on duty as Controller at Detachment #4, 528th Aircraft Control & Warning Group, I received a call from Hanada tower operator that they could see a bright light out over Tokyo Bay, Northeast of their station at approximately 1000 to 1500 feet.

I relayed this information to ADCC and started checking for an indication on the radar scope on both high and low beam. There were three (3) or four (4) blips on low beam but none I could definitely get a movement on or none I could get a reading on the HRI scope.

At 2345 hours I was relieved by Lt. Albert.

ATIL Office, D/I FEAF

STATEMENT

The undersigned officer reported for work at Site #4 at 2315I, 5 August 1952. Controller being relieved informed me of an unusual sighting reported to him by Haneda tower operator. This was reported to me as being a lighted object hovering NE of Haneda. After discussion with ADCC controller, it was decided that an F-94 should be scrambled to investigate.

At the time of scramble, I had what was believed to be the object in radar contact. The radar sighting indicated the object to be due south of this station over Tokyo Bay and approximately eight (8) miles NE of Haneda. The target was in a right orbit moving at varying speeds. It was impossible to estimate speed due to the short distance and times involved.

The F-94J reported in airborne at 0004I, 6 August 1952, the call sign was Sun Dial 20. Sun Dial 20 was told to vector Tokyo Bay area and maintain 5,000 feet. At this time, I had negative radar contact with the target. Sun Dial 20 was ordered to search the Tokyo Bay area keeping a sharp lookout for any unusual occurrences. The object was again sighted by radar at 0017I and a starboard orbit in the same area as before. Sun Dial 20 was vectored to the target. He reported contact at 0025I and reported loosing contact. Sun Dial 20 followed the target into our radar ground clutter area and we were unable to give Sun Dial 20 further assistance in re-establishing contact. Sun Dial 20 again resumed his visual search of the area until 0141I, reporting negative visual sighting anytime.

Members of my crew were outside at reported time of above occurrences and were unable to sight anything unusual. All of the above information was reported to ADCC Controller during and following the incident.

Type radar used at this station is AN/CPS-1 and AN/CPS-4. Both pieces of equipment appeared to be functioning normally. Height information was unavailable due to nearness of target to our clutter area.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Date of Report: 11 August 1952    Date of Information: 12 August 1952
Reported by (GOWN): Lt. Col. Ralph L. Brown, Air Attacks    Source: Lima press

SUMMARY: On 4 August 1952 a "flying saucer" was reported over Lima at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet. The report was made by one person and not substantiated by any other person.

2. Following is a literal translation of the sighting as reported in La Prensa, 5 August 1952:

"A luminous disk, full-moon size, which gave off a silver light and which was flying approximately 100 meters high, was seen in the sky of a man who was walking in the Ninth Block of Avenida Pacheco. The strange object appeared south of the "La Victoria" district, and after maintaining a marked gaze, disappeared at the Dos de Mayo Hospital.

"The person who saw this apparition is named [REDACTED], 32 years old. He is from Los and is the principal of a Los Aquijes District school. At present he is vacationing in Lima.

"Mr. [REDACTED] stated that at 3:15 in the afternoon he was walking on the aforementioned avenue in the Ninth Block of Avenida Pacheco when consciously he looked up into the sky and saw a rare circular object. After remaining immobile for an instant, the object suddenly turned to the last, traveled in an uneven flight path and disappeared around the Dos de Mayo Hospital."

If they had seen same, but they answered that they had not seen a thing.

COMMENTS:
This account was printed the same day as the photograph of three "flying saucers" taken in San Salmo, but the Coast Guard Station, appearing in the local press. Since considerable comment on this subject has been emanating from the start, this may be local attempts to get into the act.

On the night of 5 August 1952, at approximately 2300 hours, SOURCE, NCOIC of the Moody Air Force Base Photo Lab, saw an unidentified object from his bedroom window and observed it for approximately thirty (30) seconds. A comparison in speed between the object and a jet type aircraft in the immediate vicinity showed the object to be travelling at an extremely high rate of speed. The object also changed color as it receded from a view. The following report contains information regarding the sighting of this object.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency)                REPORT NO.           PAGE    2    OF    3    PAGES

1. On 5 August 1952 at approximately 2300 hours, SOURCE was awakened by his wife and asked to look at a lighted object which could be seen from the bedroom window. At the instance of sighting, the object was orange in color, which gradually changed to an opalescent greenish blue. The object was circular in shape, but was not defined as to outline. The course of the object was north by northeast and traveled in a straight line with view. The aerodynamic characteristics could not be determined, nor was there any trail or exhaust visible. SOURCE could not give a definite estimate as to speed of object, but compared it to a 40mm anti-aircraft tracer fired at flat trajectory. He was familiar with the speed of this type of AA gun. He judged the object to be at an altitude of forty-five hundred (4,500) to five thousand (5,000) feet. The sky was clear with a full moon shining at the time of observation. SOURCE estimated the elapsed time of sighting at thirty (30) seconds. At the same time that SOURCE saw the object, he also saw an aircraft following the same heading as the object, twenty-five hundred (2500) to three thousand (3,000) feet above the object. He identified the aircraft as a jet aircraft, due to the characteristic noise emitted, and also saw red and green navigation lights flashing on and off. In relation to the object sighted, the aircraft seemed to be standing still, SOURCE stated. The aircraft disappeared from view in the same general heading as the object.

2. SOURCE observed the object for approximately thirty (30) seconds, at 2300 hours, 5 August 1952.

3. SOURCE observed the object visually.

4. The point of observation was from SOURCE's bedroom window which faces due north and the location of the house is approximately ten (10) miles south of Valdosta, Georgia, (30/50N-83/17W). From where SOURCE was standing at the window, the object was at an angle of forty-five (45) degrees above his head.

5. SOURCE appeared willing and gave his answers in a straightforward manner. His answers were clear and to the point. His powers of observation seemed to be above average. He has been in the Air Force for fifteen (15) years, all this time as a photographer. He was an aerial photographer in the Aleutians during World War II, and an aerial photographer on "OPERATION CROSSROADS" in 1946. He had returned from Korea on 1 March 1952, after eighteen (18) months there as NCOIC of a photo reconnaissance laboratory.

6. A check with the Moody Air Force Base weather station confirmed the weather conditions on the night of the sighting to be ceiling and visibility unlimited; winds aloft conditions unknown. A full moon was present at the time of the sighting.

10. Confirmation was received from the Operations Office at Moody Air Force Base, that seven (7) aircraft were airborne from 2300 hours to approximately 2347 hours on the night of 5 August 1952, in the general area of the sighting of the object.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. SOURCE was cooperative and sincere in his statements. He did not at all seem anxious to give information other than that which he felt sure to be true, as he knew the facts. His powers of observation seemed above average, perhaps due to his fifteen (15) years experience as an Air Force photographer, World War II combat aerial photographer and photo reconnaissance laboratory technician. SOURCE could not identify the object he saw, but stated positively that it was not an aircraft with which he was familiar.

2. A signed narrative statement of the observation is appended.

STATEMENT:

TO   : Whom It May Concern

I, Frank C. Waterman, Master Sergeant AF6907278, do make the following statement of my own free will.

On the night of 5 August 1952, I was aroused from sleep by my wife, Helen C. Waterman, to observe an lighted object from our bed room window. The time was 2300 hours and the visibility very good for there was a full moon at that hour and also few or no clouds. The bedroom window faces due North and the location of the house is approximately ten (10) miles South of Valdosta, Georgia.

This lighted object appeared to be orange in color when first observed and gradually turned bluish green or opalescent as it went away from sight. The course of this object was North by North-East and was judged by me to be between forty-five hundred (4,500) and five thousand (5,000) feet. The speed of this object is very difficult for me to approximate but I would judge it to be similar to that of a 40MM shell (tracer) traveling at a flat trajectory. The altitude of this object was also compared by me to that of a 40MM shell, fused to explode at five thousand (5,000) feet. The shape of this object was circular and not defined as to outline. I would estimate the total time of observation to be about thirty seconds from my angle of view, until the object completely disappeared.

At the same time as I observed the fore-mentioned object, a jet type of aircraft with flashing red and green lights, was seen and heard by me passing over head in the same general heading as the object at an altitude of approximately seventy-five hundred (7,500) to eight thousand (8,000) feet.

FORWARDED:

Radio Station WABI, Bangor, Maine, reported on 6 August 1952 that
a "flying saucer" had been observed by one S. C. STYER in Belfast,
Maine, on 6 August 1952. At 1900 hours, STYER was in Belfast, and
described the flight of two (2) round shape, dark colored objects in
the sky over Belfast, Maine. STYER generally observed by civilian
witnesses, Belfast, Maine, as being unreliable, and believed under
the influence of alcohol.

DETAILS:

WITNESS C. S. STYER, age 45, occupation, painter and decorator,
who resides with his family on Patterson Hill, Belfast, Maine, was
interviewed on 7 August 1952, by Special Agent DAVID J. WALSH. STYER
stated in substance that at approximately 1900 hours on 6 August 1952,
he was standing on the Town porch of his home facing in a northwesterly
direction. A dark colored object, round in shape, resembling a scaled
pie plate, appeared in the sky over the city of Belfast at an altitude of
approximately 1,500 feet, and was traveling at a high rate of speed from
the southeast in a northerly direction. While in flight, the object
covered all forward motion and seemed to stand on end. After remaining
in this position for approximately (30) seconds, the object continued
to a horizontal position, remained in a northerly direction at a high rate
of speed and disappeared. STYER further advised that a few minutes after
the disappearance of the first object a second object, identical
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YRS. AGO

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Objects

FROM (Agency): Air Attaché, Lima, Peru
DATE OF REPORT: 21 August 1952     DATE OF INFORMATION: 6 August 1952     EVALUATION: B-2

BY: Col Ralph L. Brown, Air Attaché

SUMMARY:
On 5 August 1952 a Panagra pilot, Captain [redacted], reported a formation of three (3) flying discs over the air route between Lima and Nazca (about 50 miles north of Lima) at an altitude of approximately 3000 feet. This was at the sighting of similar phenomena near the town of Chala.

COMMENTS:
This account appears to be more authentic than the one reported on 4 August [reference to another report]. However, the fact that a similar sighting was reported at the same time is believed to be a mere coincidence since Chala is approximately 300 miles south of Lima. This sighting, together with the August sighting, continues to concentrate interest shown by the local press in "flying saucers", an interest which has intensified since 17 July, paralleling similar publicity in the States.

Signed by:
Lt Col L. Brown
Air Attaché

ID-GC1 185-5

In physical appearance with that of the first object, followed the same course of advance, ceased forward motion for approximately the same length of time, and disappeared and the first object, with first noted disappearance of the second object was approximately three (3) minutes.

a. JCUEW's residence is located approximately one (1) mile northwest of the center of Belfast, Maine, and is separated from the city of Belfast, Maine, by a bay of water approximately 500 yards wide.

b. At 1930 hours on 5 August 1952, the sky was overcast, and visibility was limited because by a slight haze that was forming over the harbor just north of the City of Belfast, Maine.

c. During the evening hours, many marine vessels of all types are docked and anchored in the harbor just north of the City of Belfast, Maine, and it is not unusual for searchlights and/or spotlights to be reflected against the clouds.

d. JULIAN M. FULLER, Police Officer, Belfast, Maine, advised that JCUEW was a person publicly consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, was not gainfully employed and was generally regarded by the townspeople as unreliable. FULLER stated that no reports of other persons having observed unusual objects in the sky had been received.

ACTION:

Two (2) copies of this report will be forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, Attention: MCIO, and one (1) information copy forwarded to the Commander, Atlantic Division, MATS, Westover Air Force Base, Mass. No further action is contemplated by this District Office.

Following is a literal translation of sighting of "flying saucers" as reported
in Lima, 6 August 1952:

"A formation of three "flying discs" maneuvering at great speed in the
air were between Lima at Miramar, by 3700 feet yesterday morning at 8:13 AM by the crew of a Panama place traveling to Guayaquil.
The crew members of this strange objects, which were aroused different
observations, reported that the General Air Command has informed the
Pancho Velas, near Chala, by the Cartography Service which the Peruvian
Corporation of Airports has installed in that location.

[Several paragraphs are mostly obscured by black redaction marks]

"The presence of a formation of three "flying discs" in the skies
of the Peruvian coast once again multiplies the appearance of these strange
objects which have been observed at different parts of the Peruvian
territory on various occasions. This is the first time that the "flying discs" have
been observed in formation in the Peruvian sky.

"The information given by the crew members of the Panama DC-3 aircraft with the informant furnished yesterday, stated that he saw a "flying disc" in
the sky over Lima near Ayavila Iquitos.

"CALI, Colombia, (CP), Panama pilot who arrived here today from Lima, stated that he saw three "flying discs" at dawn,
exactly 13 minutes after taking off from Limatambo Airport.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: Report of Unidentified Flying Object

Date of Report: 15 August 1952
Date of Information: 15 August 1952
Source: Lima press

Summary:
1. In 15 August 1952 a "flying saucer" was reported over Lima at an altitude of approximately 1500 feet. The report was made by one high school official from the town of Loja. This sighting was not confirmed by any other person.

2. Following is a literal translation of the sighting as reported in La Prensa, 15 August 1952:

"A luminous disk, elliptical size, which gave off a silvery light and which was approximately 100 meters high, was seen in the sky by a man who was walking in the third block of Avenida Tancos. The strange object appeared south of the "La Victoria" district, and after delineating a marked angle, disappeared at the Dos de Mayo Hospital."

"The person who saw this apparition is named [redacted], 32 years old. He is in the principal of a Los Aquijes district school. At present he is vacationing in Lima."

"[Redacted] stated that at 3:15 in the afternoon he was walking on the aforementioned avenue in the direction of Avenida Gran when unconsciously he looked up into the sky and saw a rare circular object. After remaining immobile for an instant, the object suddenly turned to the left, traveled in an uneven flight path and disappeared around the Dos de Mayo Hospital."

"[Redacted] states that immediately thereafter he asked passengers-by if they had seen same, but they answered that they had not seen a thing."

Comments:
This account was printed the same day as the photograph of three "flying saucers" taken in Salem, Mass. at our Coast Guard Station, appeared in the local press. Since considerable comment on this subject has been emanating from the States, this may be of local interest.
