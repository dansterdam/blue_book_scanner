Here is the text from the document:

ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENON* THERE ARE SEVERAL THEORIES ON THE
CAUSES OF SUCH RADAR RETURNS, BUT ALL EVIDENTLY ARE YET UN-
PROVED. ONE OF THE RADAR OBSERVERS HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME
TYPE RETURNS WHILE WORKING AT A FAR NORTHERN AF BASE.

9. FAMOUS 14/1361/KC-97F WAS CONTACTED IMMEDIATELY IN THE LOCAL
AREA. THE ONLY PERSON ABOARD OBSERVING ANY THING OUT OF THE
ORDINARY WAS THE RADIO OPERATOR,* A/2C MUCCILLO, WHO, FROM THE
RIGHT SCANNERS POSITION SAW WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE SHOOTING
STARS. A/2C MUCCILLO REPORTED SEEING APPROXIMATELY 8-16 OF
THESE OBJECTS, BUT SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THEM
FROM OTHER "SHOOTING STARS" HE HAD OBSERVED THAT NIGHT AND
ON OTHER FLIGHTS.

10. NO OTHER AIRCRAFT BESIDES FAMOUS 14.

BOMWG. THE OBSERVATIONS FROM FAMOUS 14 WHICH WAS IN THE
PALMDALE AREA DOES GIVE EVIDENCE OF METEOR ACTIVITY, BUT THE
COARSE OF THE SIGHTINGS ON THE SCOPE DOES NOT CORRESPOND
SATISFACTORILY WITH THE OBSERVATION FROM FAMOUS QRM GCI WAS
NOTIFIED, BUT COULD NOT PICK-UP THE "TARGET" ON ITS RADAR SET.
ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENON COULD POSSIBLY EXPLAIN THE RADAR RETURNS
SEEN AND THE CONSIDERABLE SPEED WITH WHICH THEY WERE OBSERVED
(APPROXIMATELY 6,000 MPH).*

1. The comments of the Gilfillan Tech rep are probably the most reliable information available to us. Ordinarily, the technical staff would not comment unless they actually caused the similar display.

2. From the information that is available it is highly unlikely that shooting stars play any part in the affair. If these returns are due to atmospheric phenomenon then as most of the type normally associated with such returns, equipment malfunction would require some good explanation.
