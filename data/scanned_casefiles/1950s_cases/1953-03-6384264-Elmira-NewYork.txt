AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

EXCERPT (PROJECT "BLUE BOOK")

ELMIRA, NEW YORK                 PN OL08 3412                 555th AC&W Sqd, Watertown, New York
13 March 1953                     15085ST, 21 MARCH 1953        UNKNOWN

             OUR 1st ACL 03085, 23 MARCH 1953

SUMMARY:
At approximately 1510 1ST, 21 March 1953, the following information was received by this station (FM) from GOC Post # TM 00 Black, Elmira, New York:

GOC Post # TM 00 Black, Elmira, New York, notified this station that an unidentified flying object was observed at 1505 1ST, 21 March 1953. There were six (6) objects spotted, apparently scattered randomly rather than in a very high altitude. This was in special resolution other than being close together, heading in a northeasterly direction. Observers, Jack Conley, Jack Gould, Elmira, New York, spotted these objects with use of binoculars but only for several seconds. Special information requested by your headquarters was not made.

"Winds were from 150 degrees at 10 knots per hour. Observers did not notify this station that the investigating aircraft were noticed. It was assumed that they did not sight them. Negative aircraft were in area. So it was not possible that the jets actually caused the report. Negative jets were in area of sighting at time of sighting. Two aircraft were seen down in investigation but found no joy."

The authenticity of this report is unknown since observation was for such a short period of time - several seconds.

These objects were not picked up on radar at this site at any time.

THOMAS G. SCHEIBEL

Intelligence Officer

Possibility - Believe being caused with the wind.
