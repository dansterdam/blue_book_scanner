Bowen, 4602 AISS, while patrolling at high speed near town limits of Marietta, Georgia, observed a bright, round, white light, similar to aircraft strobe, at jet height, moving erratically, and weather bureau personnel said all of its reports continued the "pilot noise and intelligence" pattern. The main color was a gray and with a yellow hue at aspect.

ATLANTA, APRIL 28,-- (SPECIAL) -- A BRIGHT FLASH LIKE A METEOR FLASHED IN THE SKY OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES LAST NIGHT, BRINGING A FLOOD OF TELEPHONE CALLS TO NEWSPAPERS, POLICE AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

MULTI                                                                  DOC CPY 3.24

ATLANTA, WITH FIRST 1ST AND OBJECT ATLANTA BRILLIANCE PROBABLY WAS A METEOR KNOWN AS A "FIREBALL"-- A LARGE METEOR BRIGHT ENOUGH TO CAST A REFLECTION AND UNUSUAL BRILLIANCE.

IN THE ATLANTA AND THE NORTH GEORGIA AREA WAS FLOODED WITH CALLS, GROUND OBSERVERS AND RADIO STATIONS RECEIVED MANY CALLS ABOUT THE FLASH.

A NAVY FLIER, REPORTED ON LANDING HIS T-28 AT DOBBINS AIR FORCE BASE, NEAR ATLANTA, SAID THE OBJECT "BURST WITH SUCH BRILLIANCE THAT IT DIMMED HIS".

ALL REPORTS INDICATE IT WAS VERY BRIGHT, BULLET SHAPED, FIERY RED WITH A YELLOW TRAIL AND PUT OUT A LOT OF SPARKS.

THE FLIERS SAID IT LIT UP THEIR COCKPITS. NONE OF THEM ACTUALLY SAW IT WILL THEN ALSO INDICATE IT WAS VERY HIGH. ONE JET PILOT FLYING AT ABOUT 30,000 FEET SAID HIS PLANE WAS ABOVE CORNELIA, GA, 91 MILES NORTH OF DOBBINS, HE SAW THE OBJECT.

THE MAGNITUDE OF RADIO STATION WAGA AT HOME, GA. SAID THE FLASH APPEARED NORTHEAST OF HIS HOME AT HENRY COUNTY R1 NORTH GEORGIA.

"IT LIT UP THE WHOLE DOGGONE SKY NORTHEAST FROM US," SAID ONE CALLER. "IT LOOKED LIKE A WHITE BALL TRAILED BY A RED BALL, AND MADE A WHITE LIGHT."

BOTH CALLS ON GRADUALLY, NOT AS LIGHTNING, AND THEN FADED AND DISAPPEARED TOGETHER. "HE SAID, 'THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING ABOUT SOUTHEAST'."

A ROSE SAID WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SEEN ABOUT THE SAME THING AND NOT A COMPASS READING ON ITS DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. HE SAID IT WAS BRIGHT-SOUTHEAST.

APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT YELLOW BALL THAT EXPLODED INTO TINY STARS.

THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION AND THE MARIETTA JOURNAL BOTH RECEIVED MANY CALLS FROM RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE ATLANTA AREA WERE SWAMPED WITH INQUIRIES.
