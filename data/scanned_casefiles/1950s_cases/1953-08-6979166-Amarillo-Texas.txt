Dear Sir:

In accordance with your request I am forwarding to you my observations of an unmanned object flying around in the vicinity of the Amarillo Air Terminal on August 3, 1953, at 1204 CST PM.

I was in the Amarillo Central Tower on August the 3, 1953 and was looking north out of the tower cab for an aircraft when I observed an object which I first thought was a balloon moving. The west, it was moving faster than a balloon and was holding an altitude approximately 45 degrees above the horizon and continuing east until reaching a position slightly east of a position west of the tower and coming to a stop. I realized that this object was not a balloon as it did not rise and that it was moving faster than the wind would move a balloon. This object was close enough to see that it was round and was reflective in its metallic appearance. The object remained in the same position for approximately seven seconds and the Amarillo Controller in the tower was called to look at it, so he had me coming out of the tower around the tower with the object started south and with that appeared to be moving at a speed moved to a position over the airport coming to a stop. My call to the tower at 1205 PM and at 1206 PM was coming to a stop behind the first building appearing to be identical in size, shape and appearance. They maintained over the field approximately 20 seconds and then the first one started slowly by and the second one proceeded both both disappearing at a rapid rate in approximately four seconds.

At no time did the objects change shape or appearance of being round, vapor trail or any observed. Then the objects came to a stop they did not appear to drop or have any forward motion. It is not possible to estimate altitude or size of the object as no hills or landmarks or anything to use as a base for estimate. The sky was a blue with no clouds at all.

Approximately 15 minutes later he went back out on the catwalk of the tower and observed that could have been the same objects in the vicinity of the sun moving erratically or darting, appearing or being some more of the same in a different position, no observed time off and on for approximately 45 minutes then and about 1220 PM CST and the last time observed approximately 1300 CST.

1. Mr. _____ reported to this office the following information on observations he had made with an airway at Amarillo Air Terminal, Amarillo, Texas on 3 August 1953:

a. On 3 August 1953 at 1204 hours, an object, which was first thought to be a balloon, was sighted moving from east to west. It was moving faster than a balloon and was holding an altitude of approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. The object was continuing on a westward position, slightly east of the control tower and coming to a stop. The object was close enough to see that it was round and was reflecting the sun, giving off a tremendous seconds. Then the object started south and with what appeared to be a tremendous rate of speed moved to a position over the airpark, and then came to a stop. The second object appeared both identical in size, shape and appearance. They remained over the field approximately 10 seconds, and then started straight north, and the second one proceeded south, both disappearing at a rapid rate in approximately four seconds.

b. At no time did the objects change in shape from an appearance of being round and in no vapor or wake was observed. When the objects came to a stop, they did not appear to slow up but came to a stop. It is not possible to estimate altitude or size of the objects as there are no hills, mountains or anything to use as a base for an estimate. The sky was blue and there were no clouds.

c. Approximately 15 minutes later it was observed that could have been the same objects again in the vicinity of the area, appearing to be circling. These objects would only be visible for a few seconds and then disappear, reappearing on some of the same, in a different position. These were observed off and on for approximately 15 minutes, but those clouds started moving over and they were not observed any more. The first object was seen at 1204 PM CST and the last time observed was approximately 1300 PM CST.
