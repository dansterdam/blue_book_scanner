SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
REPORT NO. 42-37-53
PAGE 3 of 4 PAGES
August 3, 1953

Base Operations Officer
Amarillo Air Force Base
Amarillo, Texas

Dear Sir:

In accordance with your request, I am forwarding to you my observations of an unidentified flying object sighted near the Amarillo Air Terminal on August 3, 1953.

I was at the Amarillo Control Tower on August the 3, 1953 and was looking north out of the tower cab for an aircraft when I observed an object which I immediately recognized as something other than an aircraft. The object was moving in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. It was a brilliant white light and was holding a steady course. The object made a fast and very sharp 90 degree turn and was moving in an easterly direction. It then made a sharp turn and started moving in a southerly direction, again at a high rate of speed.

The object was not a balloon as it did not rise and that it was moving faster than any balloon I have ever seen. I could observe no outline or shape to the object. It was simply a brilliant white light. The object appeared to be approximately 1/2 the size of a dime held at arm's length. I observed the object for approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute. They the object disappeared from my view, apparently moving out of my range of vision. The control tower did not have any other aircraft in the vicinity of the object during the time I observed it.

As you will note, this case is similar to some of the others that have been reported, and the object observed exhibited characteristics that are common to many of the unidentified flying objects that have been reported. While I cannot offer an explanation as to the identity of the object, the visual characteristics and the high rate of speed at which it was traveling would seem to indicate that it was something other than a conventional aircraft.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Amarillo Control Tower

Transcript of the text from the document:

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

DISTRIBUTION AGENCY REPORT NO.
Amarillo Air Force Base, Texas 1952-6979166

1. On 3 August 1953 at 12:45 hours, an object, which was first thought to be a large balloon, was reported to this office by personnel on duty at Amarillo AFT Terminal, Amarillo, Texas.

The object, which was first observed at an altitude estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 feet, was described as being disc-shaped and approximately 50 feet in diameter. It was observed to be hovering and then to move erratically at a high rate of speed. The object was observed to be reflecting the sun, giving off a momentary brilliant spark or flash, then darkening and appearing to be normal again. The object was observed for approximately seven seconds.

Two military observers, both having over 2,000 hours of flying time, watched the object closely and stated that it was not a balloon, aircraft, or anything they had previously encountered. They remained over the field approximately one second.

The object then proceeded south, both disappearing at a rapid rate in approximately four seconds.

As no time did the objects change in shape from an appearance of being cylindrical or cigar-shaped. They did not appear to slow up or to come to an abrupt stop. It is presumed that the speed of the object was so great that they passed out of sight in this short period of time. The sky was blue and there was nothing in the vicinity to which they could be compared.

It is estimated that the object observed could have been from 4,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude. The first object was observed to be at approximately 5,000 feet and the second object at approximately 10,000 feet. Both objects were identical in appearance and were observed for only approximately seven seconds. When the first object was first sighted, it had the appearance of being a brilliant red flash, which faded into the normal blue sky. The second object when first observed gave the same brilliant red flash and then faded into the normal blue sky.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING AND APPROVING OFFICERS:
1. The delay in forwarding this report was due to report being previously classified and the necessity of having it declassified.
