Headquarters American Meteor Society                                     1953 Feb 12

Col. Wurtsmith, Commanding
Headquarters 3360 Air Base Wing
Mitchell Air Force Base, N.Y.

Dear Sir:

In reply to your telegram, following a telephone conversation
on Feb. 10 at _________, as to a probable fireball or brilliant meteor
reported from Long Island, N.Y., on 1953 Jan 28 between 10:50 and 10:55 p.m.,
I have checked our records and find one which I am pretty sure refers to
the same body.

The man who reported it was in a car not too far from the
Flower Observatory and gave me the information over the telephone. I had
no doubt that what he saw was a bright fireball, which is a perfectly
natural body and of which I am somewhat skeptical for any reason.

This one item is the line, but he was driving and quite uncertain that though he said it was a fireball. From his account
the difference in time can be tolerated.

We reported it as a blue moon, falling at a 45° angle in
S.E. from W towards S, visible 6-8 seconds, and disappearing below his
horizon. As he saw it from front seat out of a car, he could hardly have seen
higher than 30° for the start, but of this he was uncertain.

Another brilliant one was reported to me by a friend who
also lives near on Jan. 29 about 9:50 P.m., as being white, in the east,
and falling, perpendicularly.

From the data in your telegram there seems to me absolutely
no reason to doubt that the object reported to you was a fireball, as I
said, and further I think it was the same one reported from here.

Incidentally, at all the army and navy posts near New York City,
all of which must have sentinels on duty at all hours, such an object should
be reported by them. If not, may I respectfully suggest that it be called to
the attention of commanding officers in all the services that they see sometime be instructed to report such objects. It would in no possible way interfere with their military duties and would be of value to science as well
as to you. I enclose a form to distribute to our observers.

Very sincerely yours,
/s/ and /s/ Charles S. Ridder, Director

REFERENCES (Give file number, agency, previous report, etc., or applicable)

SUMMARY: (Under comma summary of report. Give significance in final one sentence. Begin last line of report on AF Form 112 with)

The single object was sighted at wide several locations by five known observers. One at 2400 was a large, generally circular, metallic object which appeared to be stationary. Witnesses stated that the distance of the object from the four observers on Long Island (the height of the object above earth's surface) was great enough to be above a target altitude. From the earth's surface, the object appeared to be a bright, white, normal surface with would have obliterated it at the minimal altitude.

Significance: Due to the pre-eminence of Dr. Olivier in the field of meteor study at the Fels Tech Inst. that his "what was a 'bright small body' may be accepted as the solution.
