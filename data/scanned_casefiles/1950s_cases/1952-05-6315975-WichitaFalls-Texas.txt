AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Top header partially legible]

Some text in the header area is illegible due to poor image quality.

The document appears to be a technical diagram or map with lines and geometric shapes, but the details are difficult to make out clearly due to the low contrast and grainy nature of the scanned image.

Most of the text in the side columns and headers is too blurry to read with confidence.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Headings on the left side of the document are partially legible, including:
- Date of Info
- Base Intelligence
- Source
- Sees Sighted
- Loc of City

The document appears to be a standard military form with multiple sections, but much of the text is too faint or blurry to be clearly read. The word "With" is visible in the right side of the document, likely referring to "Wichita" given the filename context.

The document is a black and white scanned page with significant image degradation, making comprehensive OCR challenging.
