SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighted at Madrid, Spain,

TO: Chief, USMC

1. At 1050 hours, 23 August 1955, Major WILLIAM A. BURDICK, 
AO-728929, Chief, Procurement Division, Directorate of Procurement
Production, Spain Air Material Area (SPAM), reported an incident in which he and some Spanish nationals claimed to have sighted an unidentified flying object.

2. Maj BURDICK stated that at 14.43 hours local, 22 August 1955, while standing in the vicinity of the Generalissimo Building, in the north central part of the city of Madrid, he heard the sound of a jet aircraft. He looked up in the direction of the sound, which was above the horizon, and saw a stationary object, first thought to be a weather balloon. The altitude or size could not be estimated. However, the object were the size of a standard weather balloon (approximately 12 ft. in diameter), according to BURDICK, would have been between 3,000 and 4,000 ft.

While watching the object, the sound of the jet (which was not identified) ceased. The object, which gave the appearance to be silver in color, appeared to remain in the same relative position for approximately 15 seconds and then moved slowly toward the southeast at the same altitude. As it moved, the appearance changed from a sphere to that of a disc or the same relative size.

The object moved very slowly, appeared to hover for a moment, then continued moving. The appearance seemed to change in altitude very rapidly, and rose quite rapidly. The object seemed to go out of sight, only the edge of which was visible. Approximately 3 seconds elapsed from the time the object was first observed until it disappeared from sight.
