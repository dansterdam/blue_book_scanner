THE OBSERVERS WERE VERY CAREFUL TO CLOCK THE TIME THE OBJECT WAS UNDER OBSERVATION. CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER, THE PLANET VENUS WAS OBSERVED TO BE QUITE BRIGHT ON THE HORIZON AT THIS TIME BY GROUND OBSERVERS AT DYESS AFB. THE POSITION OF THE OBSERVERS AIRCRAFT IN RELATION TO THE PLANET VENUS COULD HAVE CAUSED THE SIGHTING OF THIS OBJECT.
