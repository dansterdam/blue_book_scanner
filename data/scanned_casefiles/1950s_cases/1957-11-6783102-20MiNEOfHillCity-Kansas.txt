ning horizontally across it, but not the planet Venus could have
extending beyond the edges of the oval caused the sighting.

(11) WING OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. BOTH OBSERVERS INSIST THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS SOMETHING OTHER THAN COCK PIT LIGHTS REFLECTED IN THE CANOPY OR NATURAL PHENOMENA. THE OBSERVS WERE VERY CAREFUL TO CLOCK THE TIME TH OBJECT WAS UNDER OBSERVATION. CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING IS UNKNOWN; HOWEVER, THE PLANET VENUS WAS OBSERVED TO BE QUITE BRIGHT ON THE HORIZON AT THIS TIME BY GROUND OBSERVERS AT DYESS AF'B. THE POSITION OF THE OBSERVES AIRCRAFT IN RELATION TO THE PLANET VENUS COULD HAVE CAUSED THE SIGHTING OF THIS OBJECT.
