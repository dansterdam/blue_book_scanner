The object was described as being aluminum colored and disk shaped with a glow around the edges and blinding bright light in the center. The object was observed high by the north approaching observers, hovered overhead for several seconds, dipped toward the south and disappeared in the distance at a high rate of speed. The object was observed visually and with radar and was described as a clear pace between cloud formations.
Operators at the 95th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Scotts Air Force Base, Illinois, and personnel of the 728th AC&W Squadron reported sightings of the unidentified flying object.
A negative report has been received from the 729th ACAW Squadron in reference to an unidentified flying object.
The age and experience of the observers reporting this sighting has been considered high enough to definite conclusions can be arrived at by this office.
