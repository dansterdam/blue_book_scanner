PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 19 October 1956
2. LOCATION: Bostonia, California
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2100 hrs (PST)
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: Yes
6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 - 20 min (photo exposure)
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: N/A
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: In report given to FBI, source stated that as part of her photography course, she fixed a camera on the ground to get a "time-exposure" of the moon. Camera was left "open" for 10-20 minutes. Then shutter closed. Upon development of the film a saucer-like object was found over a tree in the prints. Source claims she has no knowledge how the object appeared in the film.

11. COMMENTS: Negligent and different density reproduction of the prints indicates that there was a "break" in the exposure. The position of the moon and its track, which was shifted to a 45Â° angle from the original track, was the clue. Apparently a partial track of the moon was made; the shutter closed (indoors) was photographed; and an attempt to return the camera to its original position was made. Evidence of "dodging" and "burning in" of the photography in question is also evident.

12. CONCLUSIONS: [Checked box for "Other: Hoax"]

STATEMENT OF WITNESS

June 10, 1962
(Date)

I hereby state that [name redacted] identified himself to me as a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air Force, and that I so hereby voluntarily and of my own free will make the following statement, without having been subjected to any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement, and with any promise of reward, benefit, or any immunity held made to me:

I am in a Photography class at [location redacted] High School. My instructor gave us a project stating that we were to take a time exposure of the moon and stars as we would know the pattern that they make on film. On a Friday evening, either on Oct. 19, or now 2, I'm not quite sure, during a full moon, I took my box camera out to take the time exposure. I prepared up to take the camera with a rock, and I set the camera facing the moon.

In order to make the picture more interesting, I decided to take in part of the perspective that was also on the spot. After the camera was ready, I pulled out the time exposure.

as to how long the exposure should

1. Attached herewith are subject photos and a report regarding the incident.

2. Request your comment concerning the preliminary analysis made by this office, which indicates the following:

a. Source's statement that the camera was not moved does not appear valid: a stationary, time-exposure of the moon would have been shown as one continuous line. Two directions of the moon are indicated on the photograph.

b. Both enlargements show a slender-like item, above and extending outward from the middle of the object.

c. The object resembles the glass fixtures usually found hanging from ceiling - lighting arrangements.

d. In our opinion, the shutter was tripped sometime before removal of the film, and in some room having the glass fixture. A dark-colored ceiling with a clean or frosted-glass fixture, would result in the fixture, being superimposed, with any slender fixture supports and the ceiling blending into the night sky of the original exposure.

1. The comments above are in general agreement with this additional one. The moon path appears broken both in direction and exposure time. The moon appears as two, possibly three, separate images rather than a single wide line. This shows a lapse of time between separate exposures of possibly 2 - 3 minutes, a sufficient length of time for removal of the camera, a second superimposed exposure to be made, and the camera returned to nearly its original position. If the camera had not been moved, the moon path would have appeared as an uninterrupted, wide, nearly straight line.

Bostonia, California

Dear Miss

We are in receipt of a series of photographs to the Air Force by the Federal Bureau of Investigations, showing what is purported to be an unidentified flying object. A detailed analysis, which included both microscopic examinations and large-size projections, indicates the following:

a. The camera was moved sometime between the period the shutter was opened and closed. This is borne out by a study of the moon track, which would normally be a straight, unbroken-line image.

The track in the photographs is broken both in direction and time.

b. The "missing period" can be determined by taking the moon's approximate diameter of 1/2 degrees, and its known time-movement across the sky. A plot indicates that there was a lapse of time between exposures of 2 to 3 minutes. This would be sufficient time for the removal of the camera from its fixed position, after which a second superimposed image made, and the camera returned to its original position. As indicated by the broken track of the moon, the attempt to set the camera in its exact previous position was difficult to do.

c. Your attention is invited to the line slightly above the object. This appears to be part of a room ceiling, and is particularly suggestive of this assumption if a line is extended outward to form a corner. The object, in our opinion, is a conventional light fixture.


- page 8 -

d. A further examination of the photography indicates that a method of developing called "dodging" was used in one photograph, and a "burning in" process around the lighted area was used in another.

We have no grounds on which to suspect a deliberate fraud towards a government agency; however, there appears to have been some tampering by persons unknown with respect to the material submitted.

Your interest in reporting this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

Lt. Col. L. J. Tacker, USAF
Public Information Div., OI
Secretary of the Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Colonel Tacker,

I am in receipt of your letter of 9 December, and the two glossy prints of the AVRO car. Thank you for these; any additional material you can send will be much appreciated, including any press release which accompanies or enlarges on those photographs and the general subject of the air car.

I understand you are not to release UFO case photos as they are returned to the owner. I find this difficult to reconcile with two distinct cases which have now come to my attention, and on which I would appreciate any comments or conclusions.

First, you note you are not familiar with the name of [redacted], who took a photograph on 16 January 1957, and it appears on page 48 of your book, clearly labeled as a hoax. I quite agree, as I pointed out in my earlier letter, although our analysis was not so complete as the Air Force one, and did not include the ceiling lines, etc. What puzzles me is how you can include this photo without even knowing the owner and, incidentally, copyright holding of the photograph. If you didn't know this, how could the photograph be "returned to the original owner as soon as the analysis has been completed"?

My second case refers to that photograph taken by [redacted] of Denville, New Jersey, and which we sent to ATIC in May 1959. To date I have received neither results of any study, nor photograph, nor anything else from ATIC or your office, and neither has Mr. Wilson. How does this fit in with your statement about photographs, which I note is repeated often in our past correspondence?

I also know of several other cases where prints taken from their owners by Air Force representatives have never been seen again. One is local, others are not. I find your current procedures, therefore, somewhat enigmatic.

16 December 1960

Dear Mr. Munsick:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 12 December 1960 concerning unidentified flying objects.

The next photograph on page 48 of my book entitled FLYING SAUCERS AND THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE was provided by the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center as an example of a photograph book available for publication end, in line with Air Force policy, no names were used in connection with this photograph. The original photograph or negative was, of course, returned to the original owner.

Air Force records indicate that you did submit on 23 May 1959 the UFO photograph taken by Mr. [redacted] of Danville, New Jersey. The records also show additional correspondence from you on 12 June 1959 and a later file of this office to you on 2 July 1959 will be an indication that in a subsequent telephone conversation with you the negative of this photograph was requested for completion of the evaluation. This negative has never been received. Analysis and evaluation of the photograph submitted indicates that there appear to be real images on the picture; however, the negative of the picture is needed for further analysis.

It is customary to return photographs to the owner when requested or upon completion of an analysis or evaluation unless the owner indicates that the negative is in his possession and he can, therefore, have prints made at any time. I regret any delay occasioned by our failure to follow up on this matter and suggest that you submit as soon as possible the negative with an identifying letter of transmittal to ATIC for completion of the analysis.

You refer to several other cases where prints have not been returned to the owner. I am sure in the Department of Defense or ATIC could retain possession of the prints. If this is not the case, I would appreciate knowing of the specific instance involved and we will make every endeavor to return such prints if they are marked by the original owner.

Gentlemen:

I guarantee your staff that I am writing this letter in a completely natural and logical frame of mind. I have made many positive attempts to lay aside prejudice, panic, hysteria, and my ego's image of purpose.

I have been conducting a personal investigation into UFO's from records available to me. I have not found a definite, positive, or absolute proof of UFO's existence. I do not intend to draw any final conclusions. Our opinion turned about a topic as controversial hard sensitive to many people should not be of major importance. The truth, invariably, continued, and will have its genesis and research.

I have just read five books, discussing not the US flying saucers, but a good general study. This is a very good approach, it helps to understand the whole picture of UFO's between years 1947 and 1960.

It is a very plausible piece of work only as far as collection, analysis, and relaxed conclusions as to the nature of these many UFO sightings, but gentlemen, you are being very narrow minded and for that to consider the whole source speaks as being all nearly wrapped up, back to thick and hard. This just puts it!

I will tell you how can a single approach to this and how many people will possibly give up the entire effort to help the lower to a problem solution has a helpful moment hard for thousands of people. This to me is unpardonable. I think that one has accomplished much in light as ridiculous, true, investigating has to continue, but I remark that to arrive at such a light to conclusion such as it looks like started in his book that none of the UFO sightings can possibly be written from space in such a way as to much of a time productive by such a helpful conventional means.

Possibly it seems nothing a priori, we completely phony this a posteriori possibility that we have established very close themselves of space and the frequency of these self things only confirm the whole.

Gentlemen:

I assure your staff that I am writing this letter in a completely rational and logical frame of mind. I have made every possible attempt to lay aside prejudice, panic, hysteria, and over-zeolousness of purpose.

I have been conducting a personal investigation of UFO phenomena for two years. As yet I have not formed a definite and positive opinion as to the nature, purpose, or absolute possibility of UFO sightings. I do not intend to form such an opinion for quite some time, if ever. An opinion formed about a topic so controversial and sensitive to many people should not be formed with any amount of haste. The "truth" warrants continued and exhaustive analysis and research.

I have just read the book, Flying Saucers and the U. S. Air Force by Lt. Colonel Lawrence J. Tacker. This is a very good attempt to explain and simply the "Flying Saucer Period" between June, 1947 and 1960.

It is a very plausible piece of work only as far as collection, analysis, and released conclusions as to the nature of those many UFO sightings, but gentlemen, you are being very narrow minded and foolish to consider the whole "saucer episode" as being all neatly wrapped up; lock, stock and barrel. This just isn't so!

Well me, how can a single organization such as yours possibly wrap up in ten and one-half years the answer to a problem that has baffled mankind for thousands of years. This to me is inconceivable. To think that one has accomplished such a task is ridiculous. True, investigation has to continue, but I sincerely believe that to arrive at such a definite conclusion such as Lt. Colonel Tacker has stated in his book that none of the UFO sightings can possibly be visitors from space is based largely on misconceptions produced by long established conventionalism.

Let's face it, gentlemen, our present race of man inhabiting this planet is very primitive. Our science is literally just began. Fifty years of refinement is nothing compared to the great potential of a material science. Unless we face up to the fact that we are a primitive society in comparison with our greatest possible achievements; prejudice, self-centeredness, and a so-called sense of self-pride will continue to cloud the most sincere insecure investigations of flying saucer phenomena. This is clearly a nonsensical and mistaken approach to the problem of the UFO.

Let's face the evidence squarely in the face. Not the slightest possible attempt should ever be made to cloud the "truth." Doesn't it seem rational, logical, and completely obvious that a definite pattern

has been established over these thousands of years and the frequency of these sightings by very competent observers gives very solid support that there is a definite purpose in the 'UFO's? I would like a very carefully considered and unbiased answer to the above question.

It is utter ignorance, prejudice, and narrow-mindedness to try and explain the majority of UFO sightings as simply misinterpretations of familiar objects caused by unusual viewing conditions. Gentlemen, let's be more sensible and unbiased about this whole situation.

Why can't you accept the possibility that our planet is being constantly surveyed by an intelligence far superior to ours? Our modern day science is fifty years old, another race's refined science may be ten thousand years old. This to me and many other people is quite conceivable. Why don't you stop kidding yourselves and face up to the ever increasing evidence which comes to your desk. To be ignorant is one thing, but to construe "obvious evidence" is another.

"Material" evidence you say you want. Gentlemen, how much evidence do you want? Surely no one is going to capture a UFO and deliver it nicely to your doorstep for you and the whole world to see. This is impossible. To accept that UFO's are visitors from space only on the conditions that your organization see, feel, and smell the pure nonsense. Surely man cannot be that "blind." To be continually confronted with repeated UFO observations by competent and often skilled observers and to continually reject the possibility of visitors from space is the height of irony. One day you will surely regret this repeated behavior.

At this point, I would like to relate an incidence back in 1957 which I sincerely believe the U. S. Air Force tried to suppress knowingly and without regard to the personal character of the persons who submitted the UFO sighting.

The family which I am referring to lived in Bostonia, California. In 1957 I had known the family for some years. In my opinion, this family contained the highest moralistic, sincere, and honest characteristics of any family I had known before or since. Believe me, gentlemen, this point I would like to stress. You couldn't have found a more honest family if you tried.

I was attending San Diego State College at the time. One weekend I visited the family. During the visit a series of photographs were brought to my attention. Yes, I know, the minute you hear the word photograph take, fraud, trick photography, flash into your minds. Well, you can immediately cancel any notions as such. The basic snapshot was not a fake of any sort, but was a simple, innocent snapshot of a "space vehicle" hovering in the immediate vicinity of their home.

Description of Photograph
Camera used: Simple, box-type camera.
Conditions under which picture was taken:
Night time(don't recall exact time or date) Full moon, Foggy condition, but not too thick.


- page 25 -

Position of camera: About a 15Â° angle from horizontal pointed toward moon. Lens set on exposure.

Reason for picture: Experimenting with a night time exposure shot.

Contents of Photo

Almost in center of photograph, a little to the right was a very definite and sharply defined disc. It appeared to be hovering practically above tree tops (actual height above ground not determined). Disc viewed from bottom. A dark dome was located in bottom center of disc. Outer rim of disc appeared to be of a metallic nature. Small, thin radial lines seen to extend from outer circumference of dome to outermost edge of disc. Immediately behind disc and trailing off into distance was a thin black streak as if disc had cut path through fog. Upper left-hand corner of photo occupied by path of moon caused by its motion during exposure. Lower right hand corner of photo occupied by top of a pepper tree. Lower bottom part of photograph occupied by roof tops of several nearby buildings. The photograph was very clear and the disc clearly visible!

Gentlemen, may I stress once again that this photograph was genuine. I know beyond the shadow of a doubt since I know the family personally and that fakery and fraudulent intentions were totally inconceivable from a family of such high character. Impossible? not in the least. You know, there are still some honest people left in this world today. An important point about the photo which I would like to point out is that the thickness of the fog was of a very thin and misty nature making any object immersed in it still quite easily recognized. The light of the moon making the vicinity of the disc quite illuminated.

Furthermore, the family related to me that the Air Force conducted a thorough investigation of their house, immediate property, and surrounding buildings and not one piece of evidence could be found of any object which had the slightest resemblance to the disc. This ruled out any possibility of reflections from nearby objects.

I was also told that upon completion of the investigation, the Air Force could not come up with an explanation for the presence of the disc (UFO). Immediately they called the photograph false! Confronted with almost unbeatable evidence of the existence of a vehicle of some sort, once again, the investigators fall victim to those age old enemies of prejudice, self-pride and arrogance.

What a pity that such characteristics still remain in the minds of so-called educated men. They aren't showing their skilled ability, but rather their apparent disregard for the "truth." How many "truths" have gone undiscovered due to such narrow mindedness?

Furthermore the Air Force would not allow Life magazine to print a full story on the photograph. For obvious reasons, of course.

My contention is this, gentlemen. Because the photograph was so real and had no evidence of fakery and due to the nature of the subject

matter, the Air Force was forced to suppress any publication of the evidence, due to the possible repercussions which would be thrown back on the Air Force about previous investigations.

To me, this photo, in all its unretouched surface awakened me and many people to the possibility of visitors from space. This is one piece of evidence, the best I have ever seen to date, that no matter how much ridicule or so-called explanations are put forth will ever weaken or destroy the fact that some "space vehicle" was present that night. Its origin, purpose and design? Only time will unravel the answers.

Gentlemen, I urge you to study, evaluate, and consider the contents of this letter with open and unbiased minds. It is imperative that you do so; for then and only then can your staff prove to me and thousands of other people that your efforts are truly for the sole purpose of showing forth "truth" in all its wonderful consequences. An immediate reply would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
An alert U. S. citizen.

Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

Hq USAF (SAFOI-3c - Major Coleman)

1. Reference the attached letter to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center from 431 North Juniper Street, Escondido, California, dated 26 Sep 51, discussing the USAF Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program.

2. It is the PTD opinion that individuals who don't have the courtesy to write their names do not deserve a reply. However, if you plan to answer this letter it is suggested that the following points be considered for inclusion in your letter:

a. The writer indicates that he or she has not made up his or her mind concerning UFO's, but the entire tone of the letter is that of a believer.

b. The writer accuses the USAF of feeling that the UFO problem is completely solved and expresses wonder that the Air Force feels it is competent to do the job. The Air Force feels certain of two important points: (1) that UFO's do not constitute a threat to national security and (2) that all of the UFO's which have been reported to the Air Force to date can be explained as due to what can be termed natural causes. Further the writer should be made aware of the fact that the Air Force does not work on the problem alone but solicits the aid of other Government agencies, industry, educational institutions, or private scientists as the needs of any specific sighting dictate.

c. It should be pointed out that the Air Force is completely open minded and considers each case with the same care and attention and without preconceived notions of its outcome.

d. The writer indicates that a so-called pattern has been established by UFO's, and this is evidence that they are probably interplanetary space vehicles here for a specific purpose. This same approach is used to attack the Air Force position that to date no evidence is available which would indicate that UFO's are interplanetary vehicles, and that they are probably due, for the most part, to the misinterpretation of natural objects. It should be pointed out to the writer that one of the most consistent factors in nature is the adherence to pattern.

3. The case which is referenced in the attached letter is probably that which reportedly occurred in Bostonia, California, 19 Oct 56. Miss _______ daughter of ____________, while attempting to take a time exposure of the moon, allegedly inadvertently obtained a photograph of a UFO (attachment). The photograph was determined by PND to be a double exposure, the two images being a timed exposure of the moon and an exposure of a light fixture. Further evidence to support this conclusion is that if this was a fast-moving object as reported, it would show as a blurred streak on a time-exposed film. Further evidence that this photo was faked is the fact that there are two traces of the moon, indicating that the exposure of the light fixture occurred between two exposures of the moon.

4. The USAF did not directly accuse Miss _______ of attempting to perpetuate a hoax, but she was notified by letter that the Air Force was aware that the picture was a double exposure and that there were other indications that the film had been tampered with.

Attached herewith are subject photos and a report regarding the incident.

Request your comment concerning the preliminary analysis made by this which indicates the following:

a. Source's statement that the camera was not moved does not appear stationary. This-campoura of the moon would have been shown as one minus line. Two directions of the moon are indicated on the photograph.

b. Both enlargements show a slender-like item, above and extending outwards from the middle of the object.

c. The object resembles the glass fixtures usually found hanging from lighting arrangements.

d. In our opinion, the shutter was tripped sometime before removal of the film, in some room having the glass fixture. A dark-colored ceiling with a fronted-glass fixture, would result in the fixture, being superimposed, the original exposure.

SPOT INTELLIGENCE BRIEF

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object photographed by Miss [REDACTED] in Bostonia, California, on 19 October or 2 November 1956.

SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. SYNOPSIS: On 19 October or 2 November 1956, [REDACTED] made a time exposure of the moon at about 2100 hours from the yard in front of her father's church using the first of a new roll of film. This requirement was part of a class project for her photography course in school. Subsequently, the roll of film was completely used up. When the photography lab in her school began available to her, the developed film was made and one print at which time an unidentified object was observed on one of the prints. This object has the general appearance of a chandelier or 14 inch fixture. It can provide no explanation of how it comes to be in the photograph.

2. DETAILS: On 7 June 1957 at approximately 1545 hours, an agent of The Federal Bureau of Investigation, San Diego Division, delivered four photographs to this Detachment stating that they had been obtained by him during the course of an interview with [REDACTED] on 14th Street, Bostonia, California. The FBI has no further interest in the matter at this time.

3. On 10 June, Miss [REDACTED] a seventeen year old junior at El Cajon Valley High School, was interviewed by Special Agent [REDACTED]. She stated that as a part of her photography course she was required to make a time exposure of the moon and stars during the hours of darkness in order to observe their characteristics.

appearance on film. [redacted] chose a night when the moon was full
and to the best of her recollection the photograph was taken either
19 Oct or on 2 November 1956, sometime between 2100 hours and
2130 hrs. The camera was placed on the ground in the yard in
front of her [redacted] Street, Bostonia, California. The
church located at [redacted] Street was propped up a block so that the lens pointed directly
at the moon at an angle of approximately 60 degrees from the horizontal. The shutter was placed in the camera approximately 15 to 20 minutes. [redacted] stated the
camera was in exactly the same position when she found it as when
she left it. This was the first occasion on the roll of film and
the balance of the film was used during the following week, at which
time the roll was removed from the camera. [redacted] stated that
she did not develop and print the roll of film until June 1957
because she was awaiting her turn to use the facilities available to
her at school.

4. Description of the camera follows:

Nomenclature: AGFA, Model 2-2 (box camera)
Size of Camera: 1" wide, 6" high, 8" long
Lens: Fixed (non adjustable)
Shutter Speed: Timed (non adjustable)
Shutter Opening: Fixed (non adjustable)

5. [redacted] advised that she maintained no written record of
the processing of this film, but that she had developed and printed
the film herself and from memory provided the following data:

Type of Film: Kodak, Paratone X
Temperature of Chemicals used: 75Â°
Type of Developer: Tropical
Developing Time: 15 minutes
Acid Fix Time: 15 minutes
Rinse time (approx): 24 hours
Drying: Usual 24 hours

[redacted] stated that when she developed this photograph she assumed
that the object appearing in the negative was a boat or water mark.
She made a contact print on 72 paper, at which time a mile fellow
student observed the print and remarked, "It was a picture of a
flying saucer". [redacted] advised that she did not believe it at
first, but further examination by the class and by the instructor
convinced her that an object of some kind other than a water mark

of her instructor and her father, [REDACTED] notified the FBI, San
Diego Division.

6. The negative in question was obtained from [REDACTED] and is
attached. The contact print described above and three enlargements
of the unidentified flying object are attached.

7. Upon conclusion of the interview and in the presence of her
mother, [REDACTED] executed a signed, sworn statement, recapitulating
her story. She is a photography class at a [REDACTED] High
School. The instructor [REDACTED] assigned a project
involving a time exposure of the moon and stars, to allow students
to observe the pattern they make on film. [REDACTED] exposed a film
for about 10 or 20 minutes on the night of the full moon, either
1) October or 2 November 1956. Camera was placed on a stand in yard
of her father's church, 1260 Clarendon Street, Bostonia, in such
a manner as to include a paper tree. (These pictures were taken
of the moon, camera, etc., that was also part of the project.)

The original of the statement is retained in the files of Headquarters,
DO 720.

8. On 10 June 1957, S/A [REDACTED] examined the front yard of the
church and no place, lighting fixtures, or any other object was
observed other than the church building itself, and the trees that
are visible in the lower left hand corner of the photographs. These
trees are approximately 40 feet in height and approximately 20 feet
southeast of the spot on which the camera was placed.

9. On 10 June 1957, [REDACTED] art and photography
instructor at [REDACTED] High School, interviewed in his office
by S/A [REDACTED] advised that he is familiar with the photographs
submitted and that even though he is quite skeptical about flying saucers,
his examination of these negatives failed, in his opinion, to
reveal any indication of double exposure or alteration.

Further stated that he is not an expert in the field of photography
and although the object in question seems to lack serious detail,
nature, and above approach as to character and integrity.

Further stated that he is not an expert in the field of photography
and although the object in question reveals an electric light
fixture, he could offer no explanation as to how the object may
have appeared in the film. Of the opinion, nor how it could have been
placed there unknown to him. He attributes the lapse in time
between photographing the object and developing and printing, to
the fact that it was necessary for him to send the film to
use the facilities of the school photo lab.

Bostonia, California

Dear Mis[redacted]

We are in receipt of a series of photographs to the Air Force by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, showing what is purported to be an unidentified flying object. A detailed analysis, which included both microscopic examinations and large-size projections, indicates the following:

a. The camera was moved sometime between the period the shutter was opened and closed. This is borne out by a study of the moon track, which would normally be a straight, unbroken-line image. The track in the photographs is broken both in direction and time.

b. The "missing period" can be determined by taking the moon's approximate diameter of 1/2 degree, and its known time-movement across the sky. A plot indicates that there was a lapse of time between exposures of 2 to 3 minutes. This would be sufficient time for the removal of the camera from its fixed position, after which a second superimposed image made, and the camera returned to its original position. As indicated by the broken track of the moon, the attempt to set the camera in its exact previous position was difficult to do.

c. Your attention is invited to the line slightly above the object. This appears to be part of a room ceiling, and is particularly suggestive of this assumption if a line is extended outward to form a corner. The object, in our opinion, is a conventional light fixture.

d. A further examination of the photography indicates that a method of developing called "dodging" was used in one photograph, and a "burning in" process around the lighted area was used in another.

We have no grounds on which to suspect a deliberate fraud towards a government agency; however, there appears to have been some tampering by persons unknown with respect to the material submitted.

Your interest in reporting this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

STATEMENT OF WITNESS

[Date] June 10, 1962

I, [redacted], hereby state that, [redacted] himself to me as a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air Force, and that I do hereby voluntarily and of my own free will make the following statement without having been subjected to any coercion, unlawful influence or unlawful inducement, and without any promise of reward, benefit, or any immunity having been made to me:

I am in a Photography class at [redacted] Valley [redacted] High School, and our instructor gave us a project stating that we were to take a time exposure of the moon and stars so we could know the pattern that they make on film. On a Friday evening, either on Oct 19 or Nov 2, I was not quite sure, during a full moon, I took my [word] camera out to take the time exposure, I propped up the camera with a rock and set the camera saying the moon. Now in order to make the picture more interesting, I decided to take in part of the pepper tree that was also on the lot. After the camera was nearly I pulled out the time exposure [illegible word].

and went into the church, that was
now, to wait for the exposure.
It didn't make to much difference
as to how long the exposure should
lie, so I didn't track up the
time. I knew that it was there
no shorter than ten mins and no
longer than 20 mins within this
time, I went out again & clicked
the camera and turned the picture
for the next exposure.

appearance on film. Miss [redacted] chose a night when the moon was full and to the best of her recollection the photograph was taken either 19 October or 2 November 1956, sometime between 2100 hours and 2130 hours. The camera was placed on the ground in the yard in front of the church [redacted], Bostonia, California). The camera was propped up with a rock so that the lens pointed directly at the moon at an angle of approximately 60 degrees from the horizontal. The shutter was placed in "time exposure" and left in that position for a period of 10 to 20 minutes. Miss [redacted] stated that the camera was exactly the same position when she found it as when she left it. This was the first exposure on the roll of film and the balance of the film was used during the following week, at which time the roll was removed from the camera. Miss [redacted] stated that she did not develop and print the roll of film until 5 June 1957 because she was awaiting her turn to use the facilities available to her at school.

4. Description of the camera follows:

Nomenclature: AGFA, Model 3-2 (Box camera)
Size of Camera: 4" wide, 6" high, 3" long
Lens: Fixed (non adjustable)
Shutter Speed: Fixed (non adjustable)
Shutter Opening: Fixed (non adjustable)

5. Miss [redacted] advised that she maintained no written record of the processing of the film, but the lab developed and printed the film herself and from memory provided the following data:

Type of Film: Kodak, Panatropic X
Temperature of Chemicals used: 75Â°
Type of Developer: Dektol
Developing Time: 15 minutes
Acid Fix Time: 15 minutes
Rinse Time (water): 21 hours
Drying Time: 24 hours

Miss [redacted] stated that when she developed this photograph she assumed that it was a child's drawing or that a photograph was a spot or water mark.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS, on 22 papers, at which time a male fellow employee developed the same type of film and found a picture of a "flying saucer". Miss [redacted] advised that she did not believe it at first, but further examination by the class and by the instructor convinced her that an object seen kind other than a water mark

The image appears to be a black and white photograph with a grainy, low-contrast quality. There is a white or light-colored object, possibly a UFO or unidentified flying object, positioned in the lower right quadrant of the image. Several faint lines or trails are visible in the background, suggesting movement or trajectory. The left side of the image is significantly darker, creating a strong contrast with the lighter right side. No legible text is present in this image.

The text I can discern in this image is very limited:

In the bottom left area, there appears to be some handwritten text that is partially illegible.

There are some hand-drawn arrows and what looks like a small cluster of circles (possibly representing something like clouds or objects).

The image appears to be a black and white photograph or document with grainy, low-contrast characteristics typical of mid-20th century documentation. There is a small white object near the top center of the image.

Most of the specific text is too blurry or faint to read with certainty.

of her instructor and her father, Miss               notified the FBI, San
Diego Division.

6. The negative in question was obtained from Miss       and is
attached. The contact print described above and three enlargements
of the unidentified flying object are attached.

7. Upon conclusion of the interview and in the presence of her
mother, Miss                executed a signed, sworn statement, recapitulated
below:

(Paragraph is a photography class assignment. The instructor, assigned a project
involving a time exposure of the moon and stars, to allow students
to observe the pattern they make on film. Miss           exposed a film
for about 10 or 20 minutes on the night of the full moon, either
19 October or 2 November 1956. Camera was placed on ground in yard
of her                 in manner to include a pepper tree. Other pictures were taken
of the moon, candles, etc., that was also part of the project.

The original of the statement is retained in the files of Headquarters,
DO #18.

8. On 10 June 1957, S/A GRIFFIN examined the front yard of the
church and no wires, lighting fixtures, or any other object was
observed other than the church building itself, and the trees that
are visible in the lower right hand corner of the photograph. These
trees are approximately 40 feet in height and approximately 20 feet
southeast of the spot on which the camera was placed.

9. On 10 June 1957, art and photography
instructor at El Cajon Valley High School, interviewed in his office
by S/A GRIFFIN, advised that he is familiar with the photograph and
admitted that even though he is quite skeptical about flying saucers,
his examination of Miss           's negative failed, in his opinion,
to reveal any indication of double exposure or alteration. He
stated that Miss           definitely is not the type of person who would
attempt to deceive anyone because she is exceptionally serious minded,
calm, and above reproach as to character and integrity. He
further stated that he is not an expert in the field of photography
and although the object in question resembles an electric light
fixture, he could offer no explanation as to how the object may
have appeared in the film of the camera, nor how it could have been
placed there unknown to Miss           . He attributes the lapse in time

Bostonia, California, on 29 October 1956 or 2 November 1956

10. Miss [redacted] was stated that she wishes to retain possession
of the negative on which the unidentified flying object appears and
requests that it be returned to her at the earliest practicable
date.

11. On 10 June 1957, the [redacted] interviewed at his
church by S/A GRIFFIN, advised that his daughter had, in fact,
taken a photograph of the moon on which appeared an object that
he would term "a flying saucer". The [redacted] stated it is his
firm belief that his daughter has a genuine picture even though the
object looks like an inverted chandelier. The [redacted]
escorted S/A GRIFFIN through the church and through his home next
door in search of a chandelier or any other object resembling that
on the negative in question. No such object was observed. The
[redacted] advised that he has conversed with his neighbors on
this matter and has located no one with knowledge of such an occur-
rence. He stated that neither he, nor anyone he knows has observed
a flying saucer or any other unidentified flying object previously.
