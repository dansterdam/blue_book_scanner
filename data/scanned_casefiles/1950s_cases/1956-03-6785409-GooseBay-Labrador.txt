8. APPROX 4 MINUTES AFTER LEVEL OFF AT 30,500 FT ON A HEADING OF 070 
DEGREES THE A/C ANNOUNCED OVER TELEPHONE AN ACFT NIGHT AT TEN O' CLOCK. 
TACHED IT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AS IT WAS APPROACHING FROM THE EAST WHEN 
I REALIZED IT WAS NOT AN ORDINARY ACFT. IT APPEARED TO BE 2-3 MILES 
TO MY LEFT AND 2 TO 5,000 KT ABOVZ. AT THIS TIME THE OBSERVER SAW 
IT PASS FROM HIS NINE O' CLOCK POSITION AND DISAPPEAR OUT OF HIS 
ISION APPROX SEVEN 9' CLOCK. PILOT AND CO-PILOT BOTH OBSERVED IT FOR 
APPROX SIXTY SECONDS UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND US. BOTH PILOTS 
STATED IN LEVEL FLIGHT, THE OBSERVER BEST COMPARED IT TO V-2 ROC- 
KET HE SAW DURING WW II. THE CO-PILOT TURNED IN HIS SEAT AS FAR AS 
POSSIBLE AND SAID IT LOOKED ALMOST LIKE LOOKING IN THE END OF A TAIL 
PIPE AS IT PROGRESSED AWAY FROM US.
