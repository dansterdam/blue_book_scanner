(Unol) Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting

TO ATTCH-4
ATT:Lt P. Robinson

DATE 3 AUG 53

1. Enclosed is a sighting of an unidentified aerial object made by several experienced observers on 29 March 1953 at 2315 CST over San Antonio, Texas.

2. ATTCH-2 requests that you consider the following in determining the feasibility of its being caused by certain astronomical phenomena such as an unusual meteor shower. This description of the object seems to bear little or no resemblance with one notable exception: some of the objects apparently traveled in a circular course. A radar station made the contact, thus establishing the possibility of accurate observation.

3. We would appreciate your comments on the subject sighting.

Vessel Comment by Dr. Robertson to Lt. Olsson:
"Have studied the mmm incident; possible that a hoax or a high range of activity. A material object may have been reported, but the sighting that the activity got. Suggest to suggest that day or any imminent motion occurred to human nature when a simple and obvious explanation was obtained."

INFO:

PROJECT: A UNIDENTIFIED-5-53
REMEMBER HALF-2-7-53 regarding sighting made by Capt. *** on Mar 53 at 2315 CST. AFIT finds that no known meteors or showers were present on this date and, therefore, sighting probably was not caused by such phenomena. However, search lights and relfecting bosones reflecting off clouds or haze layers present a possibility. Accordingly, AFIT suggests the following information to be considered by ATIC: What was the cloud cover, if any, at the date and time of sighting, its altitude and composition (stratus, cumulous, etc.). Base weather at Kelly AFB should have this information.

The witness describes seeing a bright object in the sky that moved in a north and easterly course at a very high rate of speed. Occasionally one would change course and circle the city at approximately 15 mile radius in a clockwise direction. The speed appeared to be faster than any aircraft known at the time. The witness states that one of the objects passed through the hole light of the moon and a trail similar to a comet appeared, but the trail did not persist for long.

The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report from Project Blue Book containing a detailed narrative description of a sighting of an unidentified flying object near San Antonio, Texas in 1953.

The text of the document is as follows:

STATEMENT

As approximately 2315 hours, 25 March 1953, I was standing in the yard of my residence at 214 Vanderbilt, San Antonio, Texas, looking to the north sky. At this time, I noticed a bright light which I thought at first was a shooting star. However, when I noticed that it was traveling in a circular course, I called Mr. and Mrs. to come out observe it also. The lights appeared to be in the north and were traveling on a southerly course at a very high speed. They disappeared by traveling over the south sky, another appeared in the north, and flew approximately the same course. At no time were there more than three lights visible at one time. Occasionally one would change course and circle the city on approximately a fifteen mile radius in a clockwise direction. The speed appeared to be faster than any aircraft known to be stationed at this base or used by commercial airlines. At one time, one of the objects passed through the halo light of the moon and a trail, similar to a vapor trail, appeared, but this did not remain visible. The most unusual thing about what was seen was the tremendous speed and complete lack of sound. About fifteen minutes after noticing the first light, Mr. telephoned the Project BLUE BOOK control tower. He checked later and learned that they had been looking at the objects also. I feel that this type of phenomena control center was not contacted sooner.

EMERSON McMillin OBSERVATORY

19 May 53

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April. 

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss Gluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on individual cases so that you can handle my typing and distribution of forms.  The letter method has obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes, and she can handle my typing and distribution of forms, I had better stick to this letter method. 

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I don't mention the 25 or so more or less routine cases which you were probably informed of by the Air Force. I'm follow my usual rule of discarding those.

6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discarding those.

8 April was a meteor. The Great Circle Valley case was Venus if reported time was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was pr/obably Venus. 31 March Moothy, and 30 March Loya, were, I believe, balloons. Possibly could have been.

The April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

This brings us to the interesting cases. 25 March Sacond ground observation case and I'm surprised they don't explain this. Anything more on this one?  Don't think this is good enough for a punch-hole but it should be looked into.  

22 March Spooner, "Wise's Duration time" needs checking here. How to believe this object could have gone all that dun 15 seconds? An interesting case and one of the regular questionnaire should be sent to Dr. Hynek.

Most is the 12 April Spook AFB I think this is most interesting and deserves more serious consideration than the one I'd like to see Hynek explain this one! Is there any possibility that these could have been artifices? (As to the 26 March, Equasseuk AFB although M., the data are reconnaissance traditional on this it was a helicopter?  We ought to have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

DIVISION FLYCEPT AN UNDETERIINED NUMBER OF UNIDENTIFIED LIGHTS OF WHICH THE INTENSITY WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THAT OF AN AVERAGE STAR WAS OBSERVED IN SAN ANTONIO TEXAS ON 25 MARCH 1953 FLYING AND MANEUVERING OVER SAN ANTONIO TEXAS. NUMEROUS REPORTS ON THIS PHENOMENON REACHED THIS OFFICE BUT FACTS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS REPORTED BY THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE THE SIZE OF A PEA AT A DISTANCE OF TWO MILES. APPROXIMATE FEATURES NOTED. A TRAIL OF PHOSPHORESCENT LIGHT OR VAPOR TRAIL PASSED THROUGH THE NIGHT SKY OVER A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AND WAS VISIBLE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME. THE FIRST LIGHT APPEARED TO CONSIST OF A ROD OR TUBE LIKE SHAPES.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a flying saucer-type unidentified flying object (UFO). The photograph shows a disk-shaped object with a raised central portion, flying in a southerly direction. The text below the photograph discusses the sighting of this object, describing how it executed a complete circle at approximately fifteen miles in diameter before continuing its flight in a southerly direction until it gradually faded out of sight, leaving no physical evidence of the sighting.

PAGE TWO JUNE 11-4

THE NORTH SKY HEADING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. JUST PRIOR TO DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FIRST LIGHT IN THE SOUTH SKY, ANOTHER LIGHT APPEARED IN THE NORTH SKY, FLYING APPROXIMATELY THE SAME COURSE AS DID THE FIRST. AT NO TIME WERE THERE MORE THAN THREE LIGHTS VISIBLE AT ONE TIME. AN UNUSUAL FEATURE OF THIS OBSERVATION WAS THAT AFTER EXECUTING A STRAIGHT COURSE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, A LIGHT EXECUTED A COMPLETE CIRCLE OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MILE IN DIAMETER THAN CONTINUED ITS FLIGHT IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION UNTIL THEY DISAPPEARED BY GRADUALLY FADING OUT OF SIGHT. THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE SIGHTING. NEGATIVE RESULTS WERE REPORTED FROM THE LOCAL AO WHERE THE INCIDENT AND THE MAKING OF ALL ATTEMPTS TO PICK UP THE LIGHTS ON RADAR.
