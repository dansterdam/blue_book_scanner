COMMENT NO. 1
Lt Olson/ya
6586/h 3693/P 4-30

1. Enclosed is a sighting of an unidentified aerial object made by several observers on 25 March 1952 at 2315 CST over San Antonio, Texas.

2. ATIC-5 requests that you examine the sighting to determine the feasibility of the being a certain or phenomenal phenomenon as an annual meteor shower. The description of the objects seems to fit that of a meteor shower with one notable exception: some of the objects apparently traveled in a circular course.
A local radar station made no contact, thus eliminating the possibility of aircraft.

3. We would appreciate your comments on the subject sighting.

Verbal Comment by Dr. Robinson to Lt. Olson:
Halo around the moon indicates possible presence of clouds or high haze. A meteory became repeatedly again and again off such clouds. May have occurred the night's length. ATIC-5 got cloud condition for this day. Robinson does not feel objects were meteors, since no known meteor shower exists on this date, and some more important meters do not have calculation.

TO: CO SAAMA KELLY AFB TEXAS

INFO:
FROM: ADIC-FEAM-5-B

Regarding SALD-3-7-B reporting sighting made by Capt. [redacted] 25 Mar 53 at 2315 CST. ATIC finds that no known meteor showers were present on this date and, therefore, sighting probably was not caused by such phenomena. However, search lights and rotating beacons reflecting off clouds or haze layers present a possibility. Accordingly, ATIC requests the following information to be answered by TWO: What was the cloud cover, if any, at the date and time of sighting, its altitude and composition (strata, cumulus, etc.). Base Weather at Kelly AFB should have this information.

In reply cite Project Blue Book.

The lights appeared first, generally in the north and traveling on a southerly course at a very high rate of speed. Occasionally one would change course and circle the city on approx[imately] 15 mile radius, in a [illegible] clockwise direction. The speed appeared to be faster than any aircraft known to me therefore I hesitate to estimate the speeds at no time was any sound heard. Sometime one of the objects passed through the halo light of the moon and a trail, similar to vapor trail, appeared but the trail did not persist or remain visible.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2315 hours, 25 March 1953, I was standing in the front yard of my residence at 544 Monticello Ct., San Antonio, Texas, talking to my neighbor, Mr. [redacted] when I noticed a moving light in the north sky. At first I thought it was a shooting star until I noticed it was traveling in a circular course. I called Mr. [redacted] attention to it and then we called our wives to observe it also. The lights appeared first in the north and were traveling on a southerly course at a very high rate of speed and disappeared by gradually fading out of sight. As a rule, before each light disappeared in the south sky, another appeared in the north sky and flew approximately the same course. At no time were there more than three lights visible at one time. Occasionally one would change course and circle the city on approximately a fifteen mile radius in a clockwise direction. The speed appeared to be faster than any aircraft known to me therefore I hesitate to estimate the speed. No sound was heard at any time.

At one time, one of the objects passed through the halo light of the moon and a trail, similar to a vapor trail, appeared but the trail did not persist or remain visible. The most unusual thing about what was seen was the tremendous speed and complete lack of sound. About fifteen minutes after noticing the first light, Mrs. [redacted] telephoned the Brooks AFB control tower. We checked later and learned that they too had seen these lights. A few moments after Mrs. [redacted] telephoned Brooks control tower.

EMERSON McMLLLIN OBSERVATORY

19 May 53

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss Cluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments of each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method is has obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the 1st report I've seen of an honest to goodness mirage. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.

8 April was a net-goer.
The Great Falls 3 April case was Venus if reported time was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was probably Venus.
31 March Mooshu, and 30 March Lyle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.

The 8-April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

This brings us to the interesting cases:

25 March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Anything more come in on this? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as Nocturnal meandering; light.

29 March Spooner, Wisc. Duration times needs checking here. Hard to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular questionnaires should be sent to 1st. Gilette.

Next is the 12 April Stead AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you receive more dope on it. Questionnaires should be sent. I'd like to see Menzel explain this one! Is there any possibility that these could have been aircraft? Apparently ducks have been eliminated.

As for the 26 batch, Equasseur AFB although NUL, the data are contradictory and insufficient. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,
[Signature]

THE NORTH SKY HEADING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. JUST PRIOR TO DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FIRST LIGHT IN THE SOUTH SKY, ANOTHER LIGHT APPEARED IN THE NORTH SKY, FLYING APPROXIMATELY THE SAME COURSE AS DID THE FIRST. AT NO TIME WERE THERE MORE THAN THREE LIGHTS VISIBLE AT ONE TIME. AN UNUSUAL FEATURE OF THIS OBSERVATION WAS THAT AFTER FLYING A STRAIGHT COURSE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH FOR A TIME, ABOUT HALF OF THE LIGHTS EXECUTED A COMPLETE CIRCLE OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MILES IN DIAMETER THAN CONTINUED ITS FLIGHT IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION UNTIL THEY DISAPPEARED BY GRADUALLY FADING OUT OF SIGHT. THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE SIGHTING. NEGATIVE RESULTS WERE REPORTED FROM THE LOCAL AC & W SITE WHICH WAS AWARE OF THE INCIDENT AND WAS HAVING AN ATTEMPT TO PICK UP THE LIGHTS ON RADAR.
