Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO : Mr. Perry
DATE: April 17, 1958

FROM : Mr. Francis

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object.

1. Date of occurrence was Sunday evening, 8:45 to 9:00 P.M., E.S.T., March 2, 1958, not March 1.

2. Meteorological factors and pilot reports indicated severe, possibly extreme turbulence over Tampa and vicinity. Turbulence is varying degrees - moderate to "heavy", according to pilot's reports, occurred throughout the afternoon and evening on March 2.

3. The stability index, on the Tampa COCO4, March 3, R/S observation was minus 3. This R/S was released approximately 2 hours before the objectives was reported.

4. This object was first reported to me by the Tampa tower. They wanted to know if we had released a large red balloon the size of the R/S balloons, with a bright light on it, adding that what appeared to be one had landed on the airport. I told them no, and was told they would send a truck out. In it, soon the tower called again and said it was rising - this time all

SUBJECT:

three of us on duty went outside and saw a rather bright light (white) hovering nearly stationary, just under the clouds. (ceiling was measured 8CC4 at 1950B and 2C5R on March 2nd). After a short time, it moved off and disappeared.

Shortly thereafter, Mr. Burnham answered a call on the public telephone. It was from a man who said he and his girl friend, parked near the airport, had also seen the object, descend and rise again. He told Mr. Burnham his girl friend was quite frightened by the incident.

A short time later the Tampa tower denied seeing anything unusual.
