March 2, 1958, Tampa, Florida:
Observers ST/T/Sgt. T. D. Nevels were dispatched by the USAF-7021st Air Intelligence Service Guard Squadron in response to a report from a Tampa/Hillsborough County Deputy Sheriff who reported seeing a bright light which he at first thought was a plane but then realized was not a normal aircraft. The observers ... reached the site within 8-10 minutes and observed an unidentified flying object which rose vertically and immediately disappeared at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes before the sighting.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from the United States government, specifically an Office Memorandum dated April 17, 1958, regarding an "Unidentified Flying Object" incident that occurred on March 3, 1958 in the Tampa, Florida area.

The text in the document is as follows:

OFFICE MEMORANDUM - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
TO: Mr. Perry
FROM: Mr. Francis
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
1. Date of occurrence was Sunday evening, 3:43 to 9:00 P.M., E.S.T.
2. March 3, 1958, got March 1. Meteorological factors and pilot reports indicated severe, possibly extreme turbulence over Tampa and vicinity. Turbulence is varying extremes. Pilot's report on 3/3/58 states the object was a light like a landing light, reported "glowing," and continued approximately 2 hours before disappearing.
3. The stability index on the Tampa CCCCZ, March 3, R/S observation shows stability 3. This R/S stabilized approximately 2 hours before the objective was reported.
4. Objects observed were first reported to be by the Tampa tower. They wanted to know if we had released a balloon, as they had sited the size of the R/S balloon. When a slight light on the object was observed, the R/S balloon was ruled out, as the size was reported to be much larger than the R/S balloon.
5. P.S. Excuse O.I. typewriter.
