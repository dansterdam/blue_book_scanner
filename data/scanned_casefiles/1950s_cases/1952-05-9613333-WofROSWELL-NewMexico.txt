The image appears to contain a report from the Air Intelligence Information Report, but does not appear to contain any photographs. The text of the report is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: INCIDENT 
AREA REPORTED ON: ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO
DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 15 MAY 1952
REPORTED BY: CAPT. GEORGE L. COLBY, CHIEF REPORTING UNIT
SUMMARY: An unidentified aerial object was sighted at 2115 hours MST on 12 May 1952. The object was disc-shaped in form and its estimated altitude above the terrain was 20,000 to 40,000 feet. The object could not be precisely estimated but was faster than that of jet aircraft. This sighting is similar to many which have been the subject of investigation by USAF.

1. The object at first appeared to be a "star", but after a few minutes Sgt. Bare noticed that it was moving. The object pursued a definite course which it repeated three times while Sgt. Bare was watching. The object changed its course at random intervals, one, a zig-zagging movement from South to North, the other, the South to North track turning sharply to the West. Sgt. Bare estimated the speed to be between 40,000 and 50,000 feet, and then descended at an angle of 25° degrees. The color of the object was yellowish and was travelling in a straight level, and then climbing or descending. The speed could not be precisely estimated. Sgt. Bare could not estimate the length of the object or time it was under observation, or its altitude. The color of the object was a blue-green while travelling straight and level, and changed to a reddish color while climbing or descending.

2. The object was first sighted at 20:45 LW and remained under observation for about 25 minutes. 

3. The object was observed visually by Sgt. Bare from the ground. He had no type of lenses or glasses for aid.

4. At the time of the observation Sgt. Bare was standing at the corner of 5th Street and Pavillion Avenue in Roswell, New Mexico. The object was first sighted about 40 or 50 miles due west of Roswell at 20,000 or 30,000 feet over the mountains at Bauldosa. Roswell coordinates 33° 20' N/104° 30' W.

5. T/Sgt. Bare is considered to be a reliable and intelligent individual by his Commanding Officer and others. T/Sgt. Bare has eight years service in the USAAF and is a Maintenance Specialist. 

6. A check of the weather stations at Walker Air Force Base and Roswell Municipal Airport reveals the following pertinent data:
RSN (Walker AFB) 20:00M 15 093/78/31 T/99IOIOO307 29806
DOM (Roswell) 20:00Ml5 070/00/10 @ 5 20105 

7. There was no known meteorological or other phenomenon which might account for the sighting. A check of Walker AFB radar reveals nothing unusual on the scope at the time of the sighting.

8. There is no physical evidence of the sighting such as photographs of the sighting.

9. Interception or identification action by the observer was not feasible at the time.

The image appears to contain a diagram or illustration rather than a photograph. The diagram depicts the path of a descending light, which is described as "dim and the object appeared flat or as a straight line." The object then "appeared bound and very bright blue green when climbing." The diagram also includes some arrows and labels such as "UNCLASSIFIED."

Here is the text from the document, which appears to be a description of the observed phenomenon:

The text in the document is as follows:

On Monday, 12 May 1952, during the period 2045 - 2110 hours MST, T/Sgt RICHARD BARE, AF-15257279, United States Air Force, observed a very bright glowing object in the sky. The object appeared to be at an altitude of about 25,000 feet over the mountains east of Ruidoso, New Mexico, about 50 miles west of Roswell.

The object at first appeared to be a star, but after a few minutes it noticed that its blue-green color rapidly changing in intensity from very bright to dim.

The object pursued a definite course, which is estimated to have been approximately 30 to 40 miles per minute. While watching the object, I noticed two motions: one, a swaying movement from South to North, the other a movement across the terrain from South to North. The object then climbed almost perpendicularly to the terrain to between 40,000 to 50,000 feet, and then descended, as an angle of 45 degrees. This cycle was repeated twice, for a total of three cycles. The speed of the object was unsteady, but I could not estimate the length of the object's various courses, nor the length of time that is remained on any one course or altitude.

The color of the object changed rapidly from dim blue-green while traveling straight and level to a very bright blue-green while climbing and descending. The object's shape appeared to be that of a disc.
