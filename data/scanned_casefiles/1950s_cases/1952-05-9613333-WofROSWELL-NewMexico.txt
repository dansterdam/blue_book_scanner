AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IR-22-52

SUBJECT: FLYOBSRPT

AREA REPORTED: Roswell, New Mexico    FROM: 6th Bomb Wing, Medium, Intelligence

DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 15 May 1952    DATE OF INFORMATION: 12 May 1952    EVALUATION: B-3

PREPARED BY (OFFICER): Capt. George L. Colby, Chief Reporting Unit    T/Sgt. Raymond Bare, AF-13257279

REFERENCES: N/A

SUMMARY:
An unidentified aerial object was sighted at 2145 hours MST on 12 May 1952, about 40 miles west of Roswell, New Mexico. The object was blue-green in color and its estimated altitude above the terrain was 30,000 to 40,000 feet. The object traveled three times over approximately the same triangular course. Rate of speed could not be precisely estimated but was faster than that of jet aircraft. Intensity of color brightness varied with the object's altitude.

This sighting is similar to many which have been the subject of investigation by USAF.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

6th Bomb Wing, Medium Intelligence                                IN-22-52                                PAGE 1 OF 1

1. The object at first appeared to be a star, but after a few minutes Sgt. Bare noticed that its blue-green color changed in intensity from very bright to dim. The object pursued a definite course, which it repeated three times while Sgt. Bare was watching it. When the object was first sighted it appeared to be about 20,000 or 30,000 feet above the mountains at Ruidoso, New Mexico. It appeared to have two motions: ones, a swaying movement from South to North, the other, the South to North track of the route it was following. The object then climbed almost perpendicularly to the terrain to between 40,000 and 50,000 feet and then descended at an angle of 25 degrees, to its original altitude. This cycle was repeated twice for a total of 3 cycles. The speed of the object appeared to be faster than a jet type aircraft, but its exact speed could not be precisely estimated. Sgt. Bare could not estimate the length of the object's various courses, or the length of time that it remained on any one course, or altitude. The color of the object was a blue-green while traveling straight and level and then changed rapidly to a bright blue-green while climbing or descending. While climbing the object's shape appeared to be that of a disc.

2. The object was first sighted at 2045 LST and remained under observation for about 25 minutes.

3. The object was observed visually by Sgt. Bare from the ground. He had no type of lenses or glasses for aid.

4. At the time of the observation Sgt. Bare was standing at the corner of 5th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in Roswell, New Mexico. The object was first sighted about 40 or 50 miles due west of Roswell at 20,000 or 30,000 feet over the mountains at Ruidoso, New Mexico. Roswell coordinates: 33 20 N / 104 30 W.

5. T/Sgt. Bare is considered to be a reliable and intelligent individual by his Squadron Commander and immediate supervisors. Sgt. Bare has eight years of service in the USAF and is a B-29 Maintenance Specialist.

6. A check of the weather stations at Walker Air Force Base and Roswell Municipal Airport reveals the following teletype sequences at 2030 hours MST:
   NSW (Walker AFS) - 250015 097/78/31 ▲ 7/995/4030087 24906
   ROW (Roswell) - 7002000L40 ♦ 8 2E30S

7. There was no known meteorological or other phenomenon which might account for the sighting. A check of Walker AFB radar reveals nothing unusual on the scope at the time of the sighting. It is unknown whether the setting was on the 25 or 50 mile scan.

8. There is no physical evidence of the sighting such as photographs of the sighting.

9. Interception or identification action by the observer was not feasible at the time.

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

On Monday, 12 May 1952, during the period 2015 - 2110 hours MST, I was sitting in a car at the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and 5th Street in Roswell, New Mexico. As I glanced out of the car to the west I observed a very bright glowing object in the sky. The object seemed to be at a distance of about 25,000 feet over the mountains east of Ruidoso, New Mexico, about 50 miles west of Roswell.

The object at first appeared to be a star, but after a few minutes I noticed that its blue-green color rapidly changed in intensity from very bright to dim.

The object pursued a definite course, which it repeated three times while I was watching it. When I first saw the object it appeared to be at 20,000 or 30,000 feet above the mountains. It appeared to have two motions: one, a swaying movement from South to North, the other a movement across the terrain from South to North. The object then climbed almost perpendicularly to the terrain to between 40,000 to 50,000 feet, and then descended, at an angle of 25 degrees, to its original altitude. This cycle was repeated twice, for a total of three cycles. The speed of the object was faster than a jet, but I could not estimate its speed precisely. Neither could I estimate the length of the object's various courses, nor the length of time that it remained on any one course or altitude.

The color of the object changed rapidly from dim blue-green while traveling straight and level to a very bright bluish-green while climbing and descending. The object's shape appeared to be that of a disc.
