FUTURE WORK
The available files will be coded and punched cards will be prepared. When cards for the sighting reports for one year are completed, preliminary statistical studies will begin. The results of these studies will be used to appraise the adequacy of all the forms and codes which have been devised. Necessary corrections and additions will be made after this limited study. Then, the remaining sighting reports will be analyzed statistically.

This report describes progress for the period from October 11, 1952,

ANALYSIS OF EXISTING SIGHTING REPORTS

Sighting reports dated up to and including June, 1952, have been
processed.  Except for the reports dated 1917 and 1918, all sighting reports
up to and including March, 1952, have been evaluated.  The sighting reports for
1917 and 1918 are not available for evaluation.  As soon as the 1917 and 1918
reports are available and can be evaluated, all sighting reports for the years
1917 to 1952 will be ready as a group for preliminary analysis utilizing IBM
equipment.

Sighting reports for the month of July, 1952, have been received.
Because there are 450 sighting reports for July, processing them will not be
completed until the first week in December.  Evaluation of reports for the
months of April, May, June, and July, 1952, will require about six days of conference time.  Conferences for the evaluation of sighting reports will be
arranged as reports become processed in groups of 200.  Each group of reports
will require about two days of work for a cooperating researcher-UFAFB
evaluation team.

The text in the document is as follows:

The evaluation of 1952 reports will be more time consuming than was the case for earlier reports, because reports now are in more detail and often consist of sightings of one object by more than one individual.

Since October 16, 1952, it has been necessary to establish a rotation system for handling sighting reports, no more than 100 sighting reports being permitted away from WPAFB at any one time. Questionnaires and work sheets completed here must therefore be put in duplicate before sighting reports matching these questionnaires and work sheets are returned to WPAFB in return for unprocessed sighting reports. When evaluation conferences are held, these folders must be matched before an evaluation is made. The necessity for establishing a rotation system has caused some delay in progress.

ANALYSIS OF SOIL AND VEGETATION SAMPLES

Two samples of vegetation and soil from Pittsburgh, Kansas, which were submitted by WPAFB for analysis, have been thoroughly studied. Examination by experts on soil and vegetation disclosed no difference between the two samples from the two areas where the specimens were obtained. Tests for radioactivity likewise showed no significant difference between the two samples of soil and vegetation. Tests were made for beta, gamma, and alpha radiation. Samples of the "Kansas" soil and the vegetation will be returned to WPAFB in the near future.

CONSULTANT ON ASTRONOMY

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, of Ohio State University, attended the Boston meeting of the Optical Society of America on October 11, 1952.

The text in the document reads as follows:

took cognizance this year of the many reports of unusual aerial phenomena by including three invited papers on the subject in their otherwise straightforward scientific meeting. One of the invited papers was by Dr. Hynek, entitled "Unusual Aerial Phenomena". The other two papers were by Drs. Menzel and Liddell, of Harvard Observatory and the Atomic Energy Commission, respectively.

The papers of Menzel and Liddell, though differing somewhat in content, were identical in spirit. Both papers were characterised by the fact that numerous explanations for unexplained sightings were given without a single reference to a specific sighting in the files of the Air Technical Intelligence Command. Both papers presented a series of well-worn statements as to how jet fighters, meteors, reflections from balloons and aircraft, and optical effects, such as sundogs and mirages, could give rise to "flying saucer" reports. Since there was nothing new in either of the two papers, the trip from that standpoint was unproductive.

The paper by Dr. Hynek, in essence, was to the effect that flying saucers represented a science-public relations problem that when a sighting is made by several people, at least one of whom is an experienced observer, the mutually corroborated reports are entitled to a scientific hearing, rather than ridicule. It stressed the point that here was a subject in which the public has shown great interest. It was recommended that the relatively few well-screened reports be dealt with specifically to see whether any of the causes suggested by Drs. Liddell and Menzel are applicable and, if so, to make this known in these specific instances. On the other hand, if the suggested explanations of Drs. Liddell and Menzel do not explain well-screened cases, this should also be made known and given further scientific study.

The text in the document is as follows:

In conclusion, it was the opinion of Dr. Hynek that little was gained by attendance at the meeting. The results were negative in the sense that it was confirmed, as Dr. Hynek already believed, that Drs. Liddell and Menzel had not studied the literature and the evidence and, hence, were not qualified to speak with authority on the subject of recent sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

An attempt to arrange a meeting by Dr. Hynek with Dr. Menzel, Dr. Liddell, and Dr. Billings, after the meeting was over, was unsuccessful because Liddell and Billings both had to leave immediately after the meeting.

INTERROGATION FORMS
Five hundred copies of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" (Form A and Form B) were delivered on October 20, 1952. This questionnaire was used in place of the "Tentative Observers Data Sheet" to record data on all sighting reports dated after March 31, 1952. It has proved to be more satisfactory than the previous form, especially from the standpoint of recording data from sighting reports in greater detail.

Additional copies of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" can be supplied to UFAPB as needed.

FUTURE WORK
Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports will continue. A preliminary analysis of data on all sighting reports dated previous to 1952 will be given to UFAPB as soon as possible after evaluation is completed of the 1947 and 1948 sighting reports.

By December 10, 1952, all sighting reports dated before June 15, 1952, should be processed and evaluated, ready for IBM analysis. Complete IBM analysis of all sighting reports will not be started until all reports dated previous to 1953 are processed and evaluated. Because of the nature of the work required, and the fact that the number of reports for the last three months of 1952 is not yet known, no estimate can be given as to the time final IBM analysis will begin. It is hoped, if the frequency of sighting reports follows the present decreasing trend, that complete IBM analysis for sightings dated through 1952 may be started by February 1, 1953.

Mr. Niles E. Goll
Box 9575
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from November 10, 1952 to December 10, 1952.

Sighting reports up to and including July 25, 1952, have been processed. Except for reports dated 1947 and 1948, all sighting reports up to and including June, 1952, have been evaluated. The sighting reports for 1947 and 1948 were returned from Harvard University on November 20. Because the reports and the forms which had been filled in and placed with the institution over a year ago showed that these reports will not be available for use, the evaluation of these reports will not be accomplished.

Two evaluation conferences of two days each were held during the report period. During the report period, evaluation has been more difficult than formerly because the amount and quality of data in the average report have increased. Evaluation conferences will be scheduled in the future as reports are available.

The rotation system for handling sighting reports, whereby no more than 100 sighting reports are permitted away from ATIC at any one time, has functioned with a minimum of delay.

The preliminary analysis of 1952 sighting reports will continue. 1952 will not be analyzed on all sighting reports dated before 1952 will continue to be processed and evaluated. Results of this analysis will be given to ATIC before January 1, 1953. By about January 15, 1953, all sighting reports dated before August 10, 1952, will probably be processed and evaluated, ready for IBM analysis.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, The Ohio State University, gave advice concerning several sighting reports during the report period.

Very truly yours,
William T. Reid

Mr. Miles E. Goll
Box 9575
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from December 11, 1952, to January 10, 1953.

Sighting reports have now been processed up to and including August 10, 1952. Evaluation of sighting reports has been completed for sightings up to and including July 15, 1952. Reports for 1917 and 1918 were evaluated; these reports had been at Harvard University, and thus had not been evaluated in chronological order. In our previous letter, it was mentioned that preliminary analysis of data from all sighting reports made before 1952 would begin as soon as possible after 1951 and 1952 reports were processed and evaluated.

It had been hoped that results of the preliminary analysis would be available by January 10, 1953. This has not been possible because of the extensive processing of these reports required more time than anticipated, because of the large number of reports processed and because of the delay after their return from Harvard University. Processing of these reports required more time than anticipated, processing of our forms had been lost. This has delayed our consideration of the 1952 sighting reports.

One two-day evaluation conference was held during this report period, on December 17 and 18, 1952, as mentioned in the last progress report. Evaluation of later processing has been more difficult than for earlier ones.

Preliminary analysis by IBM machines of data from sighting reports dated between 1952 and all begin January 20, 1953, results of this analysis will be reported informally first to Captain Ruppelt, as he has requested. Later, they will be included in a routine progress report.

Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports is continuing, with evaluation conferences scheduled as they are necessary. All sighting reports dated prior to August 25, 1952, should be processed by February 15, 1953. (The period of August 10 to 25, 1952; one during which a large number of sighting reports was received.) By this same date, all reports dated before August 10, 1952, are expected to be evaluated.

Very truly yours,
William T. Reid

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from January 11, 1952 to February 10, 1953.

Sighting reports have now been processed up to and including October 15, 1952. Evaluation of sighting reports has been completed for sightings up to and including July 31, 1952.

Preliminary analysis by IBM machines of data from sighting reports for the period before February 26, 1953 is continuing, and results of the analysis will be forwarded informally to you as available.

One two-day evaluation conference was held during this report period, on February 23 and 24, 1953, because only one USAF representative was available to participate in the conference. Less than the normal number of work-days was accomplished. (Usually 150 to 200 cases can be evaluated during a two-day evaluation conference.) On January 22 and 23, 1953, some cases were evaluated during a two-day evaluation conference.

Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports is continuing. All sighting reports remaining for the year 1952 should be processed by March 15, 1953. By that same date, all sighting reports dated prior to September 1, 1952 are expected to be evaluated.

SECRET
SECURITY INFORMATION UNCLASSIFIED

SECTION I 

Tentative Observer's Data Sheet

A completed copy of the Tentative Observer's Data Sheet is
shown in Exhibit I. Two uses for this form are anticipated. First, 
filed sighting reports will be analyzed to extract facts to be entered
on this form for coding. Second, when tests establish the adequacy of
the form, it may be used directly by observers in recording sighting
reports. This latter use will conserve time now expended in extracting
information from the present reports for coding on the punched cards.

Coding Scheme

The coding scheme is illustrated in Exhibit II. This com-
pleted enclosure is to serve as an intermediate between the observer's
report and the punched-card abstract of the facts on the sighting. In
most cases, the facts on the sighting are not entered on the punched
cards directly. In some cases, intervening steps require only coding,
while in others calculations or analyses also may be involved. Prior
to discussing the uses to which the punched cards will be put, it
should be emphasized that the facts represented include:

1. Those presently on the standard form,
2. Those suggested by the Sponsor, and
3. Those suggested by the panel.

As might be expected, many more entries are proposed than have been
used previously.

SECRET  
SECURITY INFORMATION  

Punched Card  
A typical completed punched card is included for reference in Exhibit III. This card should be compared with the observer's data sheet for this sighting, prepared from the original report. The data sheet is the completed one described previously.

Statistical Studies  
From the information entered on the punched cards, it will be possible to analyze many characteristics of sightings. (See Exhibit IV.) Some of these may be obvious, others are subtle, but all seem interesting. The planning of statistical studies is necessarily incomplete. However, some examples may suggest the possible scope of study.  

Studies have been planned to reveal the variation in sighting activity with time and position. The time of sightings in conjunction with the geographical location will be used in several ways. First, time will permit correlation of sightings with astronomical and tidal phenomenon. Second, sighting times and locations may be correlated with weather conditions. These studies will assist in determining periods and areas of unusual activity. In addition, useful data on track and speed may evolve from such analyses.

Data will be compiled on the lag between sightings and the receipts of reports and supplementary information. This knowledge will aid in evaluating reports and in determining the effectiveness of collection procedures.

This page from a Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It is a security information document that describes the coding scheme used to classify UFO sightings. The text outlines how the geographical location of sightings will be coded to allow for extensive manipulation, such as extracting data for specific areas. It also explains the purpose of the interrogation forms, which are designed to extract information as discrete facts that can be corroborated and used to evaluate the observer's account. The document emphasizes the need for a broad coding scheme and the importance of planning for expansion of the system before the code is finalized.

The text in the document is as follows:

SECRET
SECURITY INFORMATION UNCLASSIFIED
The geographical location of sightings will be coded to permit extensive manipulation. For example, it will be possible to extract cards for areas bounded by parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude. It will also be possible to enter position data for facilities such as ADC, SAC, and others. Range and bearing from sighting locations to facility locations then can be calculated. The appearance and performance characteristics of sightings will be coded also. These codes will assist in classifying sightings, which is the preliminary step of identification. Where the performance and appearance characteristics check in multiple sightings, the time and location data may be used to determine the track and velocity of objects.
The interrogation forms are designed to extract information as discrete facts, later to be corroborated by an integrated written description. There are two aims here. First, the completion of the form will assist in evaluating the observer. Second, the discrete facts may be checked against the written story for evaluation. Some subtle questions cannot be answered readily, if at all. The related answers will aid in evaluating the observer.
From these brief comments, it may be clear that the basic coding scheme is broad. With punched cards, analysis of many facts on each sighting will be rapid and convenient. However, once the code is fixed, it will be difficult to extract information not incorporated in the code. For this reason, approximately 10 per cent of the space available for entries in the code has been left to provide for expansion. The desired expansion must be planned before the code is fixed. This is one item of work planned for the immediate future. After the code is fixed, necessary extension of the system can be affected with supplementary cards.

at 1850 hours, 8 November, 1948, I was standing just outside hangar No. 7 at the Newark Air Force Base, on the south side of the hangar. It was a perfectly clear night. I looked up toward the moon and noticed a pale luminous object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brightness of the moon, round like a disc, with little or no depth (thickness) to it. It appeared to be about the same relative diameter as the moon. It traveled from north northwest in an arc toward the south southwest in about one second or less, passing out of sight over another hangar. I heard no sound from the object. I estimate the speed of the object at 800 miles per hour, and its altitude at five to six thousand feet. I have seen jet aircraft make radical approaches at this field at approximately 600 miles per hour, and judging from them, the speed of the object I sighted was at least 200 miles an hour faster. From where I stood, I could see approximately 75 per cent of the path of the object. The peak of its arc was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon to the west southwest of my position.

Lt E. J. Ruppalt and Col Kirkland conferred with members of the Intelligence Division on 6 December 1951 in regard to Project Grudge. The question of whether a report that would warrant a detailed scientific study was discussed. It was concluded that there is no indication that any unidentified aerial objects to warrant a detailed scientific study was discussed. It was concluded that there is no indication that any unidentified aerial objects that were recently observed give sufficient evidence to warrant a detailed scientific study. However, a proposal to furnish consultants in the field of astronomy and astrophysics to evaluate sightings would be considered. They will also attempt to make a specific recommendation as to whether or not a field investigation of a particular object or phenomenon is necessary. It is very reasonable to believe that some types of unusual objects or phenomena have been observed on occasions. Qualified sources can attest that some reports indicate the existence of some type of unusual object or phenomenon.

Panel of Consultants
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Professor of Astronomy, Director of the Mc Millin Observatory, and Assistant Dean of the Graduate School at Ohio State University, was employed to consult on astronomical aspects of the work involved in this project. The Tentative Observer's Data Sheet, Exhibit 1, enclosed in the June 6 report, was studied by Dr. Hynek and some changes and additions were made in accordance with his suggestions.
On June 22, Dr. Hynek started a tour to interview several professional and amateur astronomer groups. The purposes of these interviews are:
1. To learn if any competent people in this profession have made sightings which have not been reported.

2. To summarise the opinions of the competent people in this field relative to the broad subjects of unidenti-fied aerial objects.
3. To obtain information and suggestions which may be useful in carrying out future phases of the work on the investigation.

This tour will be completed July 1. After Dr. Hynek had spent a short time on this tour, word was received from him that he is obtaining some interesting information from professional astronomers about sightings they have made which they have never otherwise reported. On a preliminary basis, it appears that the results of this survey will be valuable to the investigation.

Interrogation Forms:
Dr. Paul M. Fitts, Professor of Psychology and Director of Aviation Psychology at Ohio State University, and a group of his associates are now engaged in revising the Tentative Observer's Interrogation Form. 
Exhibit I, of the June 6 report. The object of this revision is to design the questionnaire so that a maximum of information regarding a sighting can be expected from the average individuals who will be filling out the questionnaires on future sightings. Trial tests with the revised questionnaire are planned to determine if the desired information on a sighting is obtained with it. It is expected that this revised questionnaire will be completed about July 16.

Analysis of Existing Sighting Reports

The file of sighting reports for 1948 has been studied in detail. Information on these reports has been coded by using Exhibit I, Tentative Observer's Data Sheet; Exhibit II, Codes; and Exhibit III, Work Sheets of the June 6 report. The coded data on the work sheets are now being transferred to IBM punched cards, as shown in Exhibit III of the June 6 report. When a file of about 150 of these coded sightings is completed, preliminary analysis trials with the IBM system will be started.

Newspaper Clipping Service

The newspaper clippings are now being sent directly to the Sponsor as requested in June.

Future Work

The coding of existing sighting reports will be continued at an accelerated rate during July. Preliminary analyses will be made with the IBM system.

A separate report on the findings of Dr. J. Allen Hynek will be prepared.

The interrogation forms are expected to be completed in July.

August 6, 1952

This special report was prepared to describe the results of a series of conferences with astronomers during and following a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Victoria, B. C., in June, 1952. It recounts personal opinions of a large number of professionally trained astronomical observers regarding unidentified aerial objects. In addition, it reports sightings by five professional astronomers that were not explainable by them. Representing the opinions of highly trained scientists, these comments should prove particularly helpful in assessing the present status of our knowledge of unknown objects in the skies.

PURPOSE OF INTERVIEWS
The desirability has been established of inquiring of professionally trained astronomers of considerable scientific background as to whether they have observed unidentified aerial objects and, if so, what their opinions are concerning them.

INTRODUCTION
This monthly report describes progress on Project Stork FPS-100, from its inception on March 31, 1952 through April 25, 1952. On and after the effective date, FPS-100 authorized air force requests to provide assistance in analyzing and evaluating reported sightings of unidentified aerial objects. The requirements are as follows:
1. Provide a panel of consultants.
2. Assist in improving interrogation forms.
3. Analyze existing sighting reports. 
4. Subscribe to a clipping service as directed, and
5. Apprise the Sponsor monthly of all work done on FPS-100.

SUMMARY
A panel of consultants has been selected and a series of brief meetings are being held in which typical sighting reports and the present interrogation forms are studied. The objectives are to indoctrinate the panel and at the same time study the reports.

had ever made sightings of unidentified aerial objects. At the same time, it is felt that it would be profitable to obtain the informal opinions and advice of high-ranking astronomers on the entire subject of unidentified aerial objects, of the manner in which the investigation of these objects was being conducted by the Air Force, and of their own inner feelings about the possibility that such objects were real and might constitute either a threat to national security or a new natural phenomena worthy of scientific investigation.

Accordingly it was assumed that a tour of several of the nation's observatories, not in the guise of an official investigator, but rather as an astronomer traveling about to discuss scientific problems. It was felt that this mild deception was necessary, that an artificial barrier to communication might not be set up which would invalidate the assumption that truly representative opinions were being obtained. Therefore, to maintain good faith, the names of the astronomers interviewed are withheld from this report.

In all, 45 astronomers were interviewed, nearly always individually except in a few cases where this was impossible. Eight observatories were visited and the National Meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Victoria, British Columbia, was attended on June 25 to June 28. Because of the confidential and highly personal manner in which the interviews quoted below were made, and to keep faith with the many astronomers interviewed, who, generally, were not aware that anything more than a personal private talk between astronomers was going on, the names of the astronomers will be withheld. They will be assigned letters, but the code will not be included in this report.

INTERVIEWS WITH ASTRONOMERS

There follows a simple narrative of the interviews, after which the opinions and advice of the astronomers will be summarized.

Astronomer A has never made any sightings and knows of none in his immediate acquaintance who have.

Astronomer B has made sightings of things which people would call "flying saucers" but hasn't seen anything that he couldn't explain. He has seen birds at night flying in formation illuminated by city lights, but probably not bright enough to have been photographed because they were traveling "pretty fast". Astronomer B wonders if some of the sightings are not due to Navy secret weapons, since only the Navy has officially said nothing about flying saucers. Astronomer B was quite outspoken and feels that past methods of handling the subject have been "stupid". He feels pilots should not be hushed up, and that secrecy only whets the public appetite.

Astronomer C has made no sightings, and is quite reluctant to discuss the subject. It is evident that he regards it as a fairly silly proceeding and subject. Difficult to bring the conversation around to the subject.

Astronomer D has made no such sightings and does not know any associate who has. He is fairly sympathetic in the matter and appears open-minded on the subject.

Astronomer E has made no sightings, but heard the great Seattle meteorite of May 11 at 1:30 a.m. Apparently, he is not much interested in the subject.

Astronomer E, from England, has made no sightings, but tells of the reports of unidentified objects in England.
Astronomer G has made no sightings, nor have his associates.
Reasonably interested in talking about the subject, he clearly does not consider it a topic of any real importance as compared with the problems he is interested in at the moment.
Astronomer H has been associated with systematic meteor observation, but not for any great length of time. He has made no sightings nor have his associates. His meteor cameras have not picked up any objects.
Astronomer I has made no sightings and it was rather difficult to get him to talk about the subject at all. Clearly he does not regard it as a problem of importance.
Astronomer J, who has had long experience at a meteor observatory, has made no sightings but clearly is very interested in the problem. He has promised cooperation should any items come to his attention. He is very much interested in seeing this problem cleared up. His professional rating is excellent.
Astronomer L has made no sightings nor, as far as he knows, have any of his associates.
Astronomer M has made no sightings. Politely interested, but he clearly does not regard it as a major problem.
Astronomer N, with an excellent professional rating, has made no sightings nor does he know of any associates who have. He said that astronomer Whipple thinks the green fireballs observed in New Mexico are small asteroids.

Whereas the ordinary meteors are cometary fragments. There is a further discussion of this point later with reference to La Paz.

Astronomer G, whose professional rating is only moderate, has seen none.

Astronomer E, whose professional rating also is only moderate, has seen none and does not consider the problem very important. (See footnote.)

Astronomer G, with an excellent professional rating, has seen no unidentified objects but says that reports come in occasionally from the Fraser River valley northwest of Vancouver. Apparently these sightings have been concerned with lights similar to the Lubbook lights.

Astronomer H has personally sighted an unidentified object, a light which loomed across his range of vision, which was obstructed by an observatory dome, much faster than a plane and much slower than a meteor. If it had been a plane, then its rapid motion could be accounted for only by closeness, but since no motion were heard, this explanation was essentially ruled out. Light was steadier than that of a meteor and was observed for about three seconds.

Astronomer R does not ascribe any particular significance to this sighting, except as it constitutes one of the many incomplete and unexplained sightings.

Astronomer R was not reluctant to talk about the subject of flying saucers and pointed out that we must not fall into the error of believing that we understand all physical phenomena. As late as the year 1800, it was thought im-

There is no reason to believe that meteorites, "stones from heaven", could fall from the sky. There is no physical evidence to support all the physical phenomena that exist have been discovered. Astronomer R is, however, violently opposed to the sensational approach to this problem. He points out that many scientists, or at least some scientists, have approached these sightings for the sake of personal glory and publicity but not for the benefit of the country. 
He is also opposed to magazines such as Life setting themselves up as scientific authorities and passing scientific judgment on sightings when not qualified to do so. In short, Astronomer R believes this subject is serious enough to be considered as a scientific problem, and that it should be taken entirely out of the sensational realm.  He believes, for instance, that a group of serious scientists should aim to help investigators by starting with a thoroughgoing investigation of the "Lubbock Lights". This investigation would comprise not only a rehash of previous sightings, but an intelligent cooperative effort to examine the world of physical phenomena and to see which of those, and which scientific or physical principles, might conceivably have led to these observations. He feels that the Lubbock incident is a particularly propitious one to start with, since the observations were made by reliable observers in a scientific atmosphere, and that, therefore, these qualified observers could discuss with other scientists their sightings in a dispassionate manner.
Astronomer R turned over the record of his sighting made at the instant of the sighting, for whatever use it may be. He is interested in the problem and eminently cooperative.

Astronomer S has seen none and is not particularly interested in the problem.

Astronomer T has personally seen nothing, but recounted the incident at Selfridge Field which occurred early in June, 1952, in which a group of fliers from Selfridge Field was sent out to attack a target over Lake Erie. As they were approaching the target, the shore observers radioed "Why don't you shoot? You are already in the target." This apparently is another example of the fairly frequent radar "sightings".

Astronomer U, Hugh Pruett, who does not mind having his name used, is Northwest Regional Director of the American Meteor Society. Although getting on in years, he has had a great deal of experience with meteor observation. He evinced considerable interest and cooperation in the problem, and the author took the liberty of asking him to cooperate with this endeavor in tracking down meteor sightings which might be associated with reports on flying saucers. He is well acquainted with all the officers and members of the American Meteor Society, and he could provide considerable help in assembling a panel of consulting astronomers. Pruett plotted the flight of the great Seattle meteor from hundreds of reports. He is an avid "tracker-downer" of such things, and he can be of considerable assistance in these matters. He himself has not made any unexplained sightings.

Pruett, although he observed no objects, did hear a very loud noise above the clouds early one morning which he does not believe was aircraft. He asked the local radio station to help; his phone was kept busy for four hours. There is no question that the noise existed, but no one found anything.

Astronomer Y has made no sightings. He was so interested in speaking of his own troubles that it was impossible to bring the conversation around to scientific problems. His professional rating is only intermediate.

Astronomer X, with a high professional rating, has made no sightings and exhibits an extremely negative attitude toward the whole problem. He feels that all sightings except the green fireballs are merely misrepresentation of familiar objects, and he has no patience with the subject. He believes that the Air Force should have enough data to settle the question of the green fireballs, and therefore settle the question. La Paz, when questioned later, said he did have sufficient observations and the objects were sight to ten miles high. Astronomer R, who happened to be present when Astronomer X was "sounding off", again reiterated that it would be a good idea for some astronomer to take a responsible attitude toward this problem, and that we will get no place by merely pooh-poohing it.

Astronomer Y has made no sightings but has stated, "If I saw one, I wouldn't say anything about it". This statement led the conversation into the question of what conditions would have to be met before he would report it. The answer from him was the same as from several other astronomers, that if he saw a genuine unexplained flying object, he would report it, but he would stipulate certain conditions that would have to be met before he would consider it genuine.

Astronomer X suggested that an article be written in some astronomical

These very hardly "flying saucers" served a very special purpose in getting

ASTRONOMER BB has made no sighting personally, but informed the writer that he would talk to a reputable committee of scientists if he did see anything.

ASTRONOMER CG has made no sightings himself although he has been in a very good position to do so. He was reluctant to discuss the matter to any extent.

ASTRONOMER DD, with a top professional rating, has seen nothing personally, nor does he know of any of his associates who have. Interested in the problem, he feels that a scientific panel could provide the answer.

ASTRONOMER EE has made some unidentifiable sightings. He has seen a phenomenon which most people would have said was a "flying saucer". This turned out to be a beacon light describing a cone of light, part of which intercepted a high cirrus cloud. This led to a series of elliptical lights moving in one direction and never coming back.

ASTRONOMER FF has seen none himself, but recently received a report from a ranger who said he was an amateur astronomer; he reported a bright light but said that it was not a meteor. ASTRONOMER FF said his recitation of the incident was very dramatic. ASTRONOMER FF suggested sending up a control "flying saucer" to see how many reports come back. Apparently he had in mind an extremely bright rocket or perhaps a spectacular balloon. (See footnote.)

Footnote: Again, I would not think much of this suggestion. It would serve to tell us how many people would be crazy enough to report this as a flying saucer. It would not show us the number of people who report a typical sighting, if the numbers agree then this would be some proof that an actual object had been sighted in the latter cases. The confusion that would be created by this maneuver is hardly worth the while. Recently, the balloon sightings over Columbus gave us an indication of some results that can be obtained. Certainly thousands or not thousands of people saw the balloons which, incidentally, were not spectacularly (Footnote continued on page 12.)

Astronomer JJ has made no sightings himself, but agrees on the policy of reporting to a duly constituted panel if he should see anything.
Astronomer LK has made no sightings and was not particularly interested in the problem.
Astronomer LL, Dr. La Paz, has already had so much publicity in Life magazine that there appears to be no reason for keeping his name secret. He is the Director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico, and is cooperative in the extreme. One sighting of his has been described in Life magazine and also fully in OSI reports. He has made extensive reports about the green fireball sightings in New Mexico in OSI reports also.
The discussion of green fireballs with many astronomers disclosed that most of them were of the opinion that these were natural objects. However, close questioning revealed that they knew nothing of the actual sightings, or their frequency or anything much about them, and therefore cannot be taken seriously. This is characteristic of scientists in general when speaking about subjects which are not in their own immediate field of concern.
Dr. La Paz has seen only one green fireball himself, but has been avid in collecting reports on the others. Because his full reports are in the CSI files, only the salient points will be discussed here. It appears that the green fireballs can be characterized as being extremely bright, most of them lighting up the sky in the daytime, estimated magnitude -12, which is extremely bright. They appear to come in bunches and at one time 10 were observed in 13 days. No noise is associated with them despite their brightness.

If the data as r ported by La Paz are correct, then we do have a strange phenomena here indeed.

Astronomer NN has not seen any. He happened to be with me, however, while I interviewed some laymen who had seen some aluminum-colored discs. 
He was most impressed by the consistency of their stories.

Astronomer NN is Clyde Tombaugh, who has already been identified in the Life article. He has made two sightings, the first of which is the one reported in Life magazine and the second was reported to me. The details can be obtained by sending him a questionnaire, as he is willing to cooperate.

Briefly, while at T-Telescope No. 3 at White Sands, he observed an object of -6 magnitude (four times brighter than the planet Venus at its brightest) travelling from the zenith to the southern horizon in about three seconds. The object executed the same maneuvers as the nighttime luminous object which was reported in Life magazine. No sound was associated with either of the sightings.

Mr. Tombaugh is in charge of optics and rocket tracking at White Sands Proving Ground. He said that if he is requested officially, which can be done by a letter to the Commanding General, Flight Determination Laboratory, White Sands Proving Ground, Las Cruces, New Mexico, he will be able to put his telescopes at White Sands at the disposal of the Air Force. 
He can have observers alerted and ready to take photographs should some object appear. I strongly recommend that this letter be sent.

Astronomer OC is a meteor observer at the Harvard Meteor Station in New Mexico. Although relatively new on the job, he observed two lights while on watch at 1:30 a.m. that moved much too fast for a plane and much too slow for a meteor.

for a meteor. The two lights were white and moved in a parallel direction. 
It is recommended that an Observer's Questionnaire be sent to this observer, 
as his sighting bears a resemblance to the sightings made by Astronomer R. It
was impossible to obtain full details of these sightings because this would
have classed me as an official investigator. The details of these sightings
should be obtained by official questionnaires.

A meteorologist at the Lowell Observatory is identified here as observer PE. He was not interviewed, but a clipping was obtained from a newspaper covering his observations made on May 27, 1950. The object
was observed between 12:15 and 12:20 p.m. on Saturday, May 20, from the grounds
of the Lowell Observatory. The object presented a bright visible disc to the
naked eye and passed moderately rapidly in front of a fractocumulus cloud in
the northwest. Upon passing in front of the cloud its appearance changed from
that of a bright object to a dark object, due to the change in contrast. No
engine noise was heard, nor was there any exhaust. It seems that this might
have been a weather balloon but in this case it would be strange if this
meteorologist would become confused by it. He reports that it was not moving
with the wind, but across the wind.

Finally, in this survey of astronomers, my associates and I at the
Perkins Observatory should be included. There are six of us there, and to
the best of my knowledge, none of us has ever seen any unexplainable object in
the skies.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a description of a sighting by an observer between 8:35 and 8:45 a.m. of a disc-shaped object in the sky that was flat and round like a flat plate, made of duralumin, and gave off reflected light similar to a highly polished airplane wing. 

The text also mentions that the observer was interviewed and would be very glad to fill out an official questionnaire. Additionally, the document discusses an interview with Mr. Redman and Mr. Morris, whose picture appeared in Life magazine in an article on flying saucers. Their stories were found to be remarkably consistent.

The document then provides a summary and discussion, noting that over 40 astronomers were interviewed, a higher percentage than among the general population, and that astronomers may be more likely to be fooled by balloons, aircraft, and similar objects compared to the general public.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report or document with text discussing the attitudes of astronomers interviewed about unidentified aerial objects.

It is interesting to remark upon the attitude of the astronomers interviewed. The great majority were neither hostile nor overly interested; they gave one the general feeling that all flying saucer reports could be explained as misrepresentations of well-known objects and that there was nothing intrinsic in the situation to cause concern. The author took the time to talk rather seriously with a few of them, and to acquaint them with the fact that some of the sightings were truly puzzling and not at all easily explainable. Their interest was almost immediately aroused, indicating that their general lethargy is due to lack of information on the subject. And certainly another contributing factor to their desire not to talk about these things is their overwhelming fear of publicity. One headline in the nation's papers to the effect that "Astronomer Sees Flying Saucer" would be enough to brand the astronomer as questionable among his colleagues.

Since the author was able to talk with the men in confidence, they were able to gather very much more of their inner thoughts on the subject than a reporter or an interrogator would have been able to do. Actual hostility is rare; concern with their own immediate scientific problems is too great. There seems to be no convenient method by which to attack this problem, and most astronomers do not wish to become involved, not only because of the danger of publicity but because the data seem tenuous and unreliable.

Therefore, it is the author's considered recommendation that the following procedure be adopted by the Air Force:

First, the problem of unidentified aerial objects should be given the status of a scientific problem. In any scientific problem, the data are gathered with meticulous care and are weighed and considered, without rush, by competent persons.

entirely competent men. Therefore, it is proposed that some reputable group 
of scientists be asked to examine recent sightings which have already gone 
through one or two screenings. If this group becomes convinced that the data 
are worthy of being treated as a scientific problem, that is, that the sightings 
are valid and that unexplained phenomena really do exist, then they should be 
asked to vouch that these data are "worthy of being admitted into court".
Armed with this scientific opinion, various scientific societies should be 
approached. The American Physical Society, the American Astronomical Society, 
and the Optical Society of America are particularly to be approached. These societies
should be asked, in view of the validity of the data, to appoint one or more 
members to constitute a panel to advise ATIC and perhaps to direct the neces-
sary researches into the phenomena. This would serve not only to work toward
an ultimate solution of the problem, but in the meantime would lend dignity
to the project.  

In short, either the phenomena which have been observed are worthy
of scientific attention or they are not. If they are, then the entire problem 
should be treated scientifically and without fanfare. It is presumed that the
scientific panel would work with the full knowledge and cooperation of the
general contractor, but would not be bound by secrecy, which would tend to
hamper their work. It is possible that this panel might be a panel in the RDB, 
similar to those in geodesy, infrared, or even cryptographic research.
In the meantime, it is recommended that the Air Force approach the
Joint Chiefs of Staff for endorsement of a considered statement of philosophy
and policy for presentation to the public press. There is much confusion in

APPENDIX

While in Los Angeles, I was asked to appear in a TV program with Gerald Herd, the BBC science analyst, with Walter Riedel, the rocket expert, and with Aldous Huxley. They were to have a round-table discussion on flying saucers. I declined immediately but was prevailed upon to be in the studio when the program was in progress. I am afraid that my presence as an astronomer "rousup their aretie" to a great degree, as the program had the general effect of convincing the hearers that flying saucers did exist. There was very little constructive about the program. It consisted of a rehash of all the things we have heard so much about already. It might be profitable, for instance, to have a TV program, sponsored by the Air Force, acquainting the public with the problem of flying saucers as a scientific problem. Though suggested jokingly, there might be some point to this, if this investigation ever gets to the scientific panel stage.

Interrogation Forms
About 800 copies of the revised Tentative Observers Questionnaire,
Exhibit A of the Fourth Status Report, dated August 11, 1952, were prepared
and sent to ATIC. A great many of these were sent out by ATIC to observers
to be filled out and returned. This was considered a "trial test" of the
questionnaire.

More than 100 of the completed questionnaires have been returned to
us. These are now being studied by Dr. Paul M. Fitts and his associates in
the Aviation Psychology Department at Ohio State University. The final
revisions of the questionnaire will be made as results of this study show that
revisions are needed. The Final Observers Questionnaire is expected to be
completed and sent to ATIC during September.

Textual output:

Analysis of Existing Sighting Reports

Work has continued on the coding of sighting reports to make possible an analysis by IBM machines.  The reports for 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1951 are nearly completed.  Considerable time was spent during August in conferences at which final evaluations were made on sightings for these years.  These final evaluations were needed to put into the IBM system for use in future analysis.  The final evaluation conference was conducted by ATIC and our personnel.  It is believed that this method of evaluation of sightings is adding greatly to the over-all analysis.  It is, however, taking additional time.  

It had previously been estimated that all of the backlog of files could be coded and placed in the IBM system by September 15, 1952.  However, during the past few months, sighting reports have been accumulating at an unprecedented rate.  In fact, the up-to-date 1952 file now contains nearly as many sightings as all previous years together.  Therefore, the task of coding and analyzing the file has approximately doubled during recent months.  

For this reason, considerably more time will be needed to put the sighting reports on a current basis and to complete the analysis.  Some of the IBM cards are now being prepared and preliminary analyses are being started.

Newspaper Clipping Service

As requested by ATIC, an order has been issued to discontinue this service on October 1, 1952.

SIXTH STATUS REPORT

ON
CONTRACT AF-19-7411, PPS-100 
to
AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
October 10, 1952

This report describes progress for the period from September 11, 1952,
to October 10, 1952.

ANALYSIS OF EXISTING SIGHTING REPORTS

Work has continued on the coding of sighting reports to permit
analysis by IBM machines. Reports up to and including 1951 are completed
except for final evaluation of about 40 per cent of them. It is anticipated
that final evaluation of all reports of sightings previous to 1952 will be
completed during the month of October, in conference with ATIC personnel.
Therefore, by the end of October all sighting reports for the years 1947, 1948,
1949, 1950, and 1951 will be ready as a group for preliminary analysis on IBM
equipment.

Sighting reports for the first four months of 1952 were received
late in September. Coding of these early 1952 reports was begun and should
be completed, except for final evaluation, by October 20. Because the quality
and quantity of information in many of the 1952 sighting reports has improved,
the final evaluation of these will take longer.

and in many cases more than one sighting is included in the folder, more time was required for coding these reports than for earlier ones. 
Because sighting reports accumulated at a rapid rate in May, June, and July, 1952, and in general were more detailed than earlier reports, it is estimated that it will require until the latter part of November, 1952, to complete processing and evaluation of these reports for IBM analysis.

MISCELLANEOUS SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS

The panel of consultants was utilized during the month to advantage on the following topics:

Analysis of Film

Two rolls of 35-mm spectrographic film and a section of gun-camera spectrographic film, furnished by the Air Force for analysis, were examined by experts on spectroscopy. After examination of the film, it was found impractical to proceed further with the analysis without more data. Although it would be possible by indirect methods to arrive at limited conclusions regarding the sources of light that were photographed, the expense would be prohibitive. Further data needed for analysis of film should be derived from controlled experiments using known sources of light, and from information on the following factors:
1. Type of camera
2. Shutter speed

3. Aperture opening
4. Range
5. Type of grid used and details of grid construction 
6. Type of film used

Simple standards could be established by which it should be possible to determine the source of light photographed with the camera and spectrographic equipment, at relatively little expense. It is believed that the camera and equipment will be most useful when the light is emitted by a single chemical element. If two or more elements are involved, analysis will be difficult with this simple recording device.

Soil and Vegetation Samples

During the month, two sets of soil and vegetation samples were studied by an agricultural specialist and by physicists.

Regarding the "Florida" samples, no difference was observed between the two samples of soil, but it was found that the root structure of the plants from the area in question was degenerated, apparently by heat, while the root structure of a control sample was undisturbed. In addition, the lower leaves, those nearest the ground under normal conditions, were slightly deteriorated, apparently by heat. No logical explanation is possible for this alteration of the first sample, beyond the suggestion that a high soil temperature around the plants could have been the cause. No radioactivity was found in any of these samples.

Allen Hynek on astronomical objects mistaken as "flying saucers". The document also discusses the use of interrogation forms during July, August, and September to obtain information from people who report sightings of unidentified aerial objects.

Regarding the "Kansas" samples, no difference was found between either the soil or the vegetation from the two areas from which the specimens were obtained. These samples are now being examined for radioactivity.

Advice and assistance from Dr. J. Allen Hynek was received during the month concerning astronomical objects mistaken as "flying saucers". A few fundamental rules which had been given before were further elaborated.

Dr. Hynek also gave ten consulting hours to the task of improving the questions in the latest revised questionnaire.

During July, August, and September, Dr. Paul M. Fitts and associates of the Aviation Psychology Department of Ohio State University have served as consultants on the preparation of a questionnaire that would permit the United States Air Force to obtain a maximum of useful information from those persons who report sightings of unidentified aerial objects. Insofar as possible, the following criteria were used in designing the questionnaire:

1. To develop questions which could transfer from the observer to the U.S. Air Force as much detailed information as possible concerning the event, without the necessity of a personal interview.

2. To develop questions that would permit some
evaluation of the accuracy and reliability 
of the observer and his report.
3. To develop questions that could be:
(a) easily understood by a majority of the public,
(b) answered with minimum effort on the part of
the observer, and
(c) objectively and easily recorded, and trans-
ferred to an automatic machine filing system.
To meet the first criterion adequately, some questions were taken
from the first "Tentative Observer's Data Sheet". Suggestions and advice from
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Professor of Astronomy, Ohio State University, were
requested and used, and other questions, believed to be important and useful,
were devised. A copy of the second draft of the "Tentative Observer's Data
Sheet" is included as Exhibit I of this report. In general, most of the
questions in the second draft seem to fall in one of the following informational
categories:
1. When the event occurred, and where the observer
was located at the time of the sighting.
2. A description of the viewing conditions.
3. A description of the phenomenon itself.
The second draft of the "Tentative Observer's Data Sheet" was
designed for a trial test for selecting and improving questions for the final
questionnaire. Over 300 of these questionnaires were sent to observers by ATIC.
Replies to 168 of them were analyzed. On the basis of this analysis, a

Summary of these replies is included in Exhibit I of this report. A new questionnaire, the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet", has been designed, in which several questions were omitted, some were revised, and others added. As an example, it was found that many observers were unable to reply to the question which asked for an estimation of the "real" size of the object. This question was restated in the form of an "apparent" size.

A sample of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" is given as Exhibit II of this report. Form A is for specific data, and Form B is for a short verbal summary expressed in the observer's own words.

Multiple-choice questions, completion questions, and drawings are used throughout the final questionnaire so as to get as accurate a description as possible. The multiple-choice question is well adapted for use in largescale statistical studies.

The second criterion used in preparing the questionnaire is most difficult to achieve. As far as possible, questions were worded to provide a check on the consistency and competence of the observer.

The best check of consistency would be to have the observer answer the questionnaire twice with an interval of time separating the two replies. Since this is not practical, it was decided that the next best way would be to have the observer fill in an objective multiple-choice section and, in addition, write out a summary description in a summary data sheet. Any obvious discrepancies between information given in this description and that given in the questionnaire would make the observer's replies questionable.

An evaluation of the observer's personality traits and mental competence is likewise difficult to achieve in such a questionnaire. In addition

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing standardized questionnaires designed to test certain aspects of individuals observing UFO sightings. The text discusses concerns about the validity of the questionnaires and the potential for observers to fabricate details or suffer severe memory distortions when recounting their experiences. It also mentions some specific questions (Nos. 5.1, 22.1, 26, and 26.1) that are intended to gauge the observer's level of certainty and the duration of the observed sighting.

The full text of the document is as follows:

SECURITY INFORMATION  UNCLASSIFIED
to the low validity of standardized questionnaires specifically designed to test these aspects of the individual, the restriction exists that the observer should not detect that his competence is being considered. In spite of the limitations, it was decided to include several questions which might operate indirectly to reveal any severely abnormal factors. Two questions (No. 24 and No. 38) were inserted for the specific purpose of detecting replies of the fantastic and over-imaginative individual. The reasonable assumption is that the person who uses fantastic explanations and descriptions, and who appears to be convinced that the sighting was produced by unknown creatures or interplanetary visitors, is not likely to be a discerning observer. It is further proposed that such individuals will be prone to fabricate details, and suffer severe memory distortions when recounting the event.
Questions Nos. 5.1 and 22.1 are intended to indicate the over-anxious respondent. With the exception of a few instances in which accurate measurements may be made, normally one would not expect an observer to be "certain" that he had seen an object for a specific time or of a specific apparent size. Again, these types of data can be subjected to controlled experimentation in which observers make estimates of duration and of size, together with certainty ratings.
Question No. 26 is an important question if No. 26.1 receives a negative reply, and if the duration of the sighting were of sufficient length that one could reasonably expect other observers also to see the object. If this is the case, then one would suspect that the sighting was a result of individual factors.
An effort was made to satisfy the third criterion for the questionnaire by using simple language and nontechnical terminology. It is recognized that

this requirement would not permit many trained observers (scientists, pilots, etc.) to present important technical data, therefore it is recommended that a different questionnaire be used or that different channels be employed for communicating with this select group of individuals.

Whenever possible, the questions were written in multiple-choice form, so that they could be easily answered and accurately recorded. If it appeared that too many categories would be needed to cover all possible responses, or if the categories would lead to doubtful or erroneous interpretation, then the question was worded so that the observer could fill in his own answer. A large number of the questions permit the observer to give a "Don't Know" or a "Don't Remember" response, and thus do not force an incorrect answer.

It was decided that the observer should be asked to circle the correct answer to the multiple-choice items, thereby allowing minimum ambiguity in the instructions and maximum objective scoring. Systems such as checking or underlining the correct answer are often misinterpreted by the respondent because of previous experience with various ambiguous checking and "X-ing" systems, such as voting procedures.

It is anticipated that when a sufficient sample of replies has been received from the second questionnaire that further minor revisions will appear necessary.

SECRET SECURITY INFORMATION
-2-

A preliminary analysis of the existing report file has been completed. Information derived from this analysis has been applied in improving the present interrogation form. A Tentative Observer's Data Sheet has been prepared and studied by the consultants' panel. Pertinent suggestions were incorporated in the tentative form, which is enclosed for review in Section I. The revised data sheet now includes all technical details thought to be essential. It is to be evaluated next by an astronomer, a psychologist, and a CAA investigator. Arrangements for their evaluations are now being made. 

The facts reported in present files or on new sightings are to be entered on the observer's data sheet. This information will not be coded for direct entry on punched cards. Instead, the facts will be classified and analyzed before entries are made on the punched cards. To facilitate this process, a coding scheme has been prepared to serve as an intermediate step between the data sheet and the punched card.

A copy is enclosed in Section I.

The final element in the data record is the punched card on which the results of coded calculations and analyses are entered. A copy of a typical card is also enclosed in Section I.

Newspaper accounts of sightings furnished by the clipping service are being received at approximately a constant rate; however, the Life article is now responsible for only about half of the clippings. Originally, the clippings were copied at Battelle, and then transmitted to the Sponsor. In the future, the clippings will be sent directly to the Sponsor by Battelle.
