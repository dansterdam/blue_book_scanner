FUTURE WORK

The available files will be coded and punched cards will be prepared. When cards for the sighting reports for one year are completed, preliminary statistical studies will begin. The results of these studies will be used to appraise the adequacy of all the forms and codes which have been devised. Necessary corrections and additions will be made after this limited study. Then, the remaining sighting reports will be analyzed statistically.

SEVENTH STATUS REPORT

on

CONTRACT AF-19714, PPS-100

to

AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE

November 10, 1952

This report describes progress for the period from October 11, 1952, to November 10, 1952.

ANALYSIS OF EXISTING SIGHTING REPORTS

Sighting reports dated up to and including June, 1952, have been processed. Except for the reports dated 1947 and 1948, all sighting reports up to and including March, 1952, have been evaluated. The sighting reports for 1947 and 1948 are not available for evaluation. As soon as the 1947 and 1948 reports are available and can be evaluated, all sighting reports for the years 1947 to 1951 will be ready as a group for preliminary analysis utilizing IBM equipment.

Sighting reports for the month of July, 1952, have been received. Because there are 450 sighting reports for July, processing them will not be completed until the first week in December. Evaluation of reports for the months of April, May, June, and July, 1952, will require about six days of conference time. Conferences for the evaluation of sighting reports will be arranged as reports become processed in groups of 200. Each group of reports will require about two days of work for a cooperating researcher-WPAFB evaluation team.

Here is the text from the document:

-2-

The evaluation of 1952 reports will be more time consuming than was the case for earlier reports, because reports now are in more detail and often consist of sightings of one object by more than one individual.

Since October 16, 1952, it has been necessary to establish a rotation system for handling sighting reports, no more than 100 sighting reports being permitted away from WPAFB at any one time. Questionnaires and work sheets completed here must therefore be put in duplicate folders before sighting reports matching these questionnaires and work sheets are returned to WPAFB in return for unprocessed sighting reports. When evaluation conferences are held, these folders must be matched before an evaluation is made. The necessity for establishing a rotation system has caused some delay in progress.

ANALYSIS OF SOIL AND VEGETATION SAMPLES

Two samples of vegetation and soil from Pittsburg, Kansas, which were submitted by WPAFB for analysis, have been thoroughly studied. Examination by experts on soil and vegetation disclosed no difference between the two samples from the two areas where the specimens were obtained. Tests for radioactivity likewise showed no significant difference between the two samples of soil and vegetation. Tests were made for beta, gamma, and alpha radiation. Samples of the "Kansas" soil and the vegetation will be returned to WPAFB in the near future.

CONSULTANT ON ASTRONOMY

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, of Ohio State University, attended the Boston meeting of the Optical Society of America on October 11, 1952. The Society


- page 11 -

took cognizance this year of the many reports of unusual aerial phenomena by
including three invited papers on the subject in their otherwise straightforward
scientific meeting. One of the invited papers was by Dr. Hynek, entitled
"Unusual Aerial Phenomena". The other two papers were by Drs. Menzel and
Liddell, of Harvard Observatory and the Atomic Energy Commission, respectively.

The papers of Menzel and Liddell, though differing somewhat in content, were identical in spirit. Both papers were characterized by the fact
that numerous explanations for unexplained sightings were given without a
single reference to a specific sighting in the files of the Air Technical Intelligence Command. Both papers presented a series of well-worn statements as
to how jet fighters, meteors, reflections from balloons and aircraft, and
optical effects, such as sundogs and mirages, could give rise to "flying saucer"
reports. Since there was nothing new in either of two papers, the trip
from that standpoint was unproductive.

The paper by Dr. Hynek, in essence, was to the effect that flying
saucers represented a science-public relations problem that when a sighting
is made by several people, at least one of whom is an experienced observer,
the mutually corroborated reports are entitled to a scientific hearing, rather
than ridicule. It stressed the point that here was a subject in which the
public has shown great interest. It was recommended that the relatively few
well-screened reports be dealt with specifically to see whether any of the
causes suggested by Drs. Liddell and Menzel are applicable, and, if so, to make
this known in these specific instances. On the other hand, if the suggested
explanations of Drs. Liddell and Menzel do not explain well-screened cases,
this should also be made known and given further scientific study.

In conclusion, it was the opinion of Dr. Hynek that little was gained by attendance at the meeting. The results were negative in the sense that it was confirmed, as Dr. Hynek already believed, that Drs. Liddell and Menzel had not studied the literature and the evidence and, hence, were not qualified to speak with authority on the subject of recent sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

An attempt to arrange a meeting by Dr. Hynek with Dr. Menzel, Dr. Liddell, and Dr. Billings, after the meeting was over, was unsuccessful because Liddell and Billings both had to leave immediately after the meeting.

INTERROGATION FORMS

Five hundred copies of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" (Form A and Form B) were delivered to WPAFB on October 20, 1952. This questionnaire was used in place of the "Tentative Observers Data Sheet" to record data on all sighting reports dated after March 31, 1952. It has proved to be more satisfactory than the previous form, especially from the standpoint of recording data from sighting reports in greater detail.

Additional copies of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" can be supplied to WPAFB as needed.

FUTURE WORK

Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports will continue. A preliminary analysis of data on all sighting reports dated previous to 1952 will be given to WPAFB as soon as possible after evaluation is completed of the 1947 and 1948 sighting reports.


- page 14 -

By December 10, 1952, all sighting reports dated before June 15, 1952, should be processed and evaluated, ready for IBM analysis. Complete IBM analysis of all sighting reports will not be started until all reports dated previous to 1953 are processed and evaluated. Because of the nature of the work required, and the fact that the number of reports for the last three months of 1952 is not yet known, no estimate can be given as to the time final IBM analysis will begin. It is hoped, if the frequency of sighting reports follows the present decreasing trend, that complete IBM analysis for sightings dated through 1952 may be started by February 1, 1953.

Mr. Miles E. Goll
Box 9575
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from November 11, 1952, to December 10, 1952.

Sighting reports up to and including July 25, 1952, have been processed. Except for reports dated 1947 and 1948, all sighting reports up to and including June, 1952, have been evaluated. The sighting reports for 1947 and 1948 were returned from Harvard University on November 20. Because the reports and the forms which had been filled in and placed with the folders were mixed up, these reports will not be ready for evaluation until about December 15.

Two evaluation conferences of two days each were held during this report period, on November 12 and 13, and on December 3 and 4. During the report period, evaluation has been more difficult than formerly, because the amount and quality of data in the average report have increased. Evaluation conferences will be scheduled in the future as reports are available.

The rotation system for handling sighting reports, whereby no more than 100 sighting reports are permitted away from WPAFB at any one time, has functioned with a minimum of delay.

Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports will continue. The preliminary analysis of data on all sighting reports dated before 1952 will begin as soon as the 1947 and 1948 reports can be straightened out and evaluated. Results of this analysis will be given to WPAFB at the earliest possible time. It is hoped that the results will be available by January 1, 1953. By about January 15, 1953, all sighting reports dated before August 10, 1952, will probably be processed and evaluated, ready for IBM analysis.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, The Ohio State University, gave advice concerning several sighting reports during the report period.

Very truly yours,

Mr. Miles E. Goll
Box 9575
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from December 11, 1952, to January 10, 1953.

Sighting reports have now been processed up to and including August 10, 1952. Evaluation of sighting reports has been completed for sightings up to and including July 15, 1952. Reports for 1947 and 1948 were evaluated; these reports had been at Harvard University, and thus had not been evaluated in chronological order. In our previous letter to you, dated December 15, 1952, it was stated that a preliminary analysis of data from all sighting reports made before 1952 would begin as soon as possible after the 1947 and 1948 reports were reprocessed and evaluated.

It had been hoped that results of the preliminary analysis would be available by January 1, 1953. This has not been possible, because of the extensive work required in reprocessing the 1947 and 1948 sighting reports after their return from Harvard University. Reprocessing these reports required more time than anticipated, because many of our forms had been lost. This has delayed our consideration of the 1952 sighting reports.

One two-day evaluation conference was held during this report period, on December 17 and 18, 1952. As mentioned in the last progress report, evaluation of later sighting reports has been more difficult than for earlier ones.

Preliminary analysis by IBM machines of data from sighting reports dated before 1952 will begin January 20, 1953. Results of this analysis will be sent to WAFB as soon as they are available. The results will be reported informally first to Captain Ruppelt, as he has requested. Later, they will be included in a routine progress report.

Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports is continuing, with evaluation conferences scheduled as they are necessary. All sighting reports dated prior to August 25, 1952, should be processed by February 15, 1953. (The period of August 10 to 25, 1952, was one during which a large number of sighting reports was received.) By this same date, all reports dated before August 1, 1952, are expected to be evaluated.

Very truly yours,
William T. Reid

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from January 11, 1953, to February 10, 1953.

Sighting reports have now been processed up to and including October 15, 1952. Evaluation of sighting reports has been completed for sightings up to and including July 31, 1952.

Preliminary analysis by IBM machines of data from sighting reports dated before 1952 began on January 26, 1953. This work is continuing, and results of the analysis will be forwarded informally to Captain Pappelt as soon as they are available.

One two-day evaluation conference was held during this report period, on January 22 and 23, 1953. Because only one USAF representative was available to participate in the conference, less than the normal amount of work was accomplished. (Usually, 180 to 200 cases can be evaluated during a two-day conference. On January 22 and 23, 1953, 145 cases were evaluated.)

Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports is continuing, with evaluation conferences scheduled as they are necessary. All sighting reports for the year 1952 should be processed by March 15, 1953. By that same date, all sighting reports dated prior to September 1 are expected to be evaluated.

SECTION I

Tentative Observer's Data Sheet

A completed copy of the Tentative Observer's Data Sheet is shown in Exhibit I. Two uses for this form are anticipated. First, filed sighting reports will be analyzed to extract facts to be entered on this form for coding. Second, when tests establish the adequacy of the form, it may be used directly by observers in recording sighting reports. This latter use will conserve time now expended in extracting information from the present reports for coding on the punched cards.

Coding Scheme

The coding scheme is illustrated in Exhibit II. This completed enclosure is to serve as an intermediate between the observer's report and the punched-card abstract of the facts on the sighting. In most cases, the facts on the sighting are not entered on the punched cards directly. In some cases, intervening steps require only coding, while in others calculations or analyses also may be involved. Prior to discussing the uses to which the punched cards will be put, it should be emphasized that the facts represented include:

1. Those presently on the standard form,
2. Those suggested by the Sponsor, and
3. Those suggested by the panel.

As might be expected, many more entries are proposed than have been used previously.

Punched Card

A typical completed punched card is included for reference in Exhibit III. This card should be compared with the observer's data sheet for this sighting, prepared from the original report. The data sheet is the completed one described previously.

Statistical Studies

From the information entered on the punched cards, it will be possible to analyze many characteristics of sightings. (See Exhibit IV.) Some of these may be obvious, others are subtle, but all seem interesting. The planning of statistical studies is necessarily incomplete. However, some examples may suggest the possible scope of study.

Studies have been planned to reveal the variation in sighting activity with time and position. The time of sightings in conjunction with the geographical location will be used in several ways. First, time will permit correlation of sightings with astronomical and tidal phenomena. Second, sighting times and locations may be correlated with weather conditions. These studies will assist in determining periods and areas of unusual activity. In addition, useful data on track and speed may evolve from such analyses.

Data will be compiled on the lag between sightings and the receipts of reports and supplementary information. This knowledge will aid in evaluating reports and in determining the effectiveness of collection procedures.

The geographical location of sightings will be coded to
permit extensive manipulation. For example, it will be possible to
extract cards for areas bounded by parallels of latitude and meridians
of longitude. It will also be possible to enter position data for
facilities such as ADC, SAC, and others. Range and bearing from sighting
locations to facility locations then can be calculated. The appearance
and performance characteristics of sightings will be coded also. These
codes will assist in classifying sightings, which is the preliminary
step of identification. Where the performance and appearance characteristics check in multiple sightings, the time and location data
may be used to determine the track and velocity of objects.

The interrogation forms are designed to extract information
as discrete facts, later to be corroborated by an integrated written
description. There are two aims here: First, the completion of the
form will assist in evaluating the observer. Second, the discrete
facts may be checked against the written story for evaluation. Some
subtle questions cannot be answered readily, if at all. The related
answers will aid in evaluating the observer.

From these brief comments, it may be clear that the basic
coding scheme is broad. With punched cards, analysis of many facts
on each sighting will be rapid and convenient. However, once the code
is fixed, it will be difficult to extract information not incorporated
in the code. For this reason, approximately 10 per cent of the space
available for entries in the code has been left to provide for expansion.

The desired expansion must be planned before the code is fixed. This is
one item of work planned for the immediate future. After the code is
fixed, necessary extension of the system can be effected with supplementary
cards.

21. In your own words please describe the sighting you observed. Use sketches if desired. All observations from the time of first sighting to the time of disappearance are important. Include a description of the weather, wind, and cloud conditions at the time of this sighting.

at 1850 hours, 8 November, 1948, I was standing just outside hangar No. 7 at the Newark Air Force Base, on the south side of the hangar.

It was a perfectly clear night. I looked up toward the moon and noticed a pale luminous object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brightness of the moon, round like a disc, with little or no depth (thickness) to it. It appeared to be about the same relative diameter as the moon. It traveled from north northwest in an arc toward the south southwest in about one second or less, passing out of sight over another hangar. I heard no sound from the object.

I estimate the speed of the object at 800 miles per hour, and its altitude at five to six thousand feet. I have seen jet aircraft make tactical approaches at this Field at approximately 600 miles per hour, and judging from them, the speed of the object I sighted was at least 200 miles an hour faster. From where I stood, I could see approximately 75 per cent of the path of the object. The peak of its arc was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon to the west southwest of my position.

BATTELLE

Lt E. J. Ruppelt and Col Kirkland conferred with members of the Project Blue Book on 26 December 1951 in regard to Project Grudge. The question of whether or not there was enough material available on unidentified aerial objects to warrant a detailed scientific study was discussed.

It was decided that there was enough material available and would submit a proposal to furnish consultants in the fields of astronomy, applied psychology, physics, etc. They will also attempt to make a statistical analysis of the reports in an attempt to obtain some pattern or trend.

It is very reasonable to believe that some type of unusual object or phenomena is being observed as many of the sightings have been made by highly qualified sources.

by

July 7, 1952

This report describes progress on Project Stork, PPS-100, for the period from June 6, 1952, to July 7, 1952.

Panel of Consultants

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Professor of Astronomy, Director of the McMillin Observatory, and Assistant Dean of the Graduate School at Ohio State University, was employed to consult on astronomical aspects of the work involved in this project. The Tentative Observer's Data Sheet, Exhibit I, enclosed in the June 6 report was studied by Dr. Hynek and some changes and additions were made in accordance with his suggestions.

On June 22, Dr. Hynek started a tour to interview several professional and amateur astronomer groups. The purposes of these interviews are:

1. To learn if any competent people in this profession have made sightings which have not been reported.

2. To summarize the opinions of the competent people in
this field relative to the broad subjects of unidenti-
fied aerial objects.

3. To obtain information and suggestions which may be
useful in carrying out future phases of the work
on the investigation.

This tour will be completed July 11. After Dr. Hynek had spent
a short time on this tour, word was received from him that he is obtaining
some interesting information from professional astronomers about sightings
they have made which they have never otherwise reported. On a preliminary
basis, it appears that the results of this survey will be valuable to the
investigation.

Interrogation Forms

Dr. Paul M. Pitts, Professor of Psychology and Director of Avia-
tion Psychology at Ohio State University, and a group of his associates
are now engaged in revising the Tentative Observer's Interrogation Forms,
Exhibit I, of the June 6 report. The object of this revision is to design
the questionnaire so that a maximum of information regarding a sighting
can be expected from the average individuals who will be filling out the
questionnaires on future sightings. Trial tests with the revised ques-
tionnaire are planned to determine if the desired information on a sight-
ing is obtained with it. It is expected that this revised questionnaire
will be completed about July 16.

Analysis of Existing Sighting Reports

The file of sighting reports for 1948 has been studied in detail. Information on these reports has been coded by using Exhibit I, Tentative Observer's Data Sheet, Exhibit II, Codes, and Exhibit III, Work Sheet, of the June 6 report. The coded data on the work sheets are now being transferred to IBM punched cards, as shown in Exhibit III of the June 6 report. When a file of about 150 of these coded sightings is completed, preliminary analysis trials with the IBM system will be started.

Newspaper Clipping Service

The newspaper clippings are now being sent directly to the Sponsor as requested in June.

Future Work

The coding of existing sighting reports will be continued at an accelerated rate during July. Preliminary analyses will be made with the IBM system.

A separate report on the findings of Dr. J. Allen Hynek will be prepared.

The interrogation forms are expected to be completed in July.

August 6, 1952

This special report was prepared to describe the results of a series of conferences with astronomers during and following a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Victoria, B. C., in June, 1952. It recounts personal opinions of a large number of professionally trained astronomical observers regarding unidentified aerial objects. In addition, it reports sightings by five professional astronomers that were not explainable by them. Representing the opinions of highly trained scientists, these comments should prove particularly helpful in assessing the present status of our knowledge of unknown objects in the skies.

PURPOSE OF INTERVIEWS

The desirability has been established of inquiring of professionally trained astronomers of considerable scientific background as to whether they

INTRODUCTION

This monthly report describes progress on Project Stork PPS-100, from its inception on March 31, 1952 through April 25, 1952. On and after the effective date, PPS-100 authorized us on request to provide assistance in analyzing and evaluating reported sightings of unidentified aerial objects. The requirements are as follows:

1. Provide a panel of consultants.
2. Assist in improving interrogation forms.
3. Analyze existing sighting reports.
4. Subscribe to a clipping service, as directed, and
5. Apprise the Sponsor monthly of all work done on PPS-100.

SUMMARY

A panel of consultants has been selected and a series of brief meetings are being held in which typical sighting reports and the present interrogation forms are studied. The objectives are to indoctrinate the panel and at the same

INTERVIEWS WITH ASTRONOMERS

There follows a simple narrative of the interviews, after which the opinions and advice of the astronomers will be summarized.

Astronomer A has never made any sightings and knows of none in his immediate acquaintance who have.

Astronomer B has made sightings of things which people would call "flying saucers" but hasn't seen anything that he couldn't explain. He has seen birds at night flying in formation illuminated by city lights, but probably not bright enough to have been photographed because they were traveling "pretty fast". Astronomer B wonders if some of the sightings are not due to Navy secret weapons, since only the Navy has officially said nothing about flying saucers. Astronomer B was quite outspoken and feels that past methods of handling the subject have been "stupid". He feels pilots should not be hushed up, and that secrecy only whets the public appetite.

Astronomer C has made no sightings, and is quite reluctant to discuss the subject. It is evident that he regards it as a fairly silly proceeding and subject. Difficult to bring the conversation around to the subject.

Astronomer D has made no such sightings and does not know any associate who has. He is fairly sympathetic in the matter and appears open minded on the subject.

Astronomer E has made no sightings, but heard the great Seattle meteorite of May 11 at 1:30 a.m. Apparently, he is not much interested in the subject.

Astronomer F, from England, has made no sightings, but tells of the reports of unidentified objects in England.

Astronomer G has made no sightings, nor have his associates.

Reasonably interested in talking about the subject, he clearly does not consider it a topic of any real importance as compared with the problems he is interested in at the moment.

Astronomer H has been associated with systematic meteor observation, but not for any great length of time. He has made no sightings nor have his associates. His meteor cameras have not picked up any objects.

Astronomer I has made no sightings and it was rather difficult to get him to talk about the subject at all. Clearly he does not regard it as a problem of importance.

Astronomer J, who has had long experience at a meteor observatory, has made no sightings but clearly is very interested in the problem. He has promised cooperation should any items come to his attention. He is very much interested in seeing this problem cleared up. His professional rating is excellent.

Astronomer L has made no sightings nor, as far as he knows, have any of his associates.

Astronomer M has made no sightings. Politely interested, but he clearly does not regard it as a major problem.

Astronomer N, with an excellent professional rating, has made no sightings nor does he know of any associates who have. He said that astronomer Whipple thinks the green fireballs observed in New Mexico are small asteroids.

whereas the ordinary meteors are cometary fragments. There is a further discussion of this point later with reference to La Paz.

Astronomer O, whose professional rating is only moderate, has seen none.

Astronomer P, whose professional rating also is only moderate, has seen none and does not consider the problem very important. (See footnote.)

Astronomer Q, with an excellent professional rating, has seen no unidentified objects but says that reports come in occasionally from the Fraser River valley northeast of Vancouver. Apparently these sightings have been concerned with lights similar to the Lubbock lights.

Astronomer R has personally sighted an unidentified object, a light which loomed across his range of vision, which was obstructed by an observatory dome, much faster than a plane and much slower than a meteor. If it had been a plane, then its rapid motion could be accounted for only by closeness, but since no motors were heard, this explanation was essentially ruled out. Light was steadier than that of a meteor and was observed for about three seconds.

Astronomer R does not ascribe any particular significance to this sighting, except as it constitutes one of the many incomplete and unexplained sightings.

Astronomer R was not reluctant to talk about the subject of flying saucers and pointed out that we must not fall into the error of believing that we understand all physical phenomena. As late as the year 1800, it was thought im-

Footnote: The professional ratings given here show that "sightings" and interest in the problem do not run inversely proportional to the professional rating of the astronomer.

Astronomer S has seen none and is not particularly interested in the
problem.

Astronomer T has personally seen nothing, but recounted the incident
at Selfridge Field which occurred early in June, 1952, in which a group of
fliers from Selfridge Field was sent out to attack a target over Lake Erie.
As they were approaching the target, the shore observers radioed "Why don't
you shoot? You are already in the target." This apparently is another example
of the fairly frequent radar "sightings".

Astronomer U, Hugh Pruett, who does not mind having his name used,
is Northwest Regional Director of the American Meteor Society. Although
getting on in years, he has had a great deal of experience with meteor obser-
vation. He evinced considerable interest and cooperation in the problem, and
I took the liberty of asking him to cooperate with this endeavor in tracking
down meteor sightings which might be associated with reports on flying saucers.
He is well acquainted with all the officers and members of the American Meteor
Society, and he could provide considerable help in assembling a panel of con-
sulting astronomers. Pruett plotted the flight of the great Seattle meteor
from hundreds of reports. He is an avid "tracker-downer" of such things, and
he can be of considerable assistance in these matters. He himself has not
made any unexplained sightings. I checked my knowledge of meteors with him
and corroborated the points that there are many meteors that are green, that
some drop vertically, that some wobble, some have noise associated with them,
and some have been seen as long as 25 seconds. There is one record in the
literature of a meteor that lasted 50 seconds, but this seems hardly possible.

time to determine all essential and necessary facts which should be disclosed by
an ideal completed form. A coding scheme is being devised to record these facts
and to facilitate analysis. The project files for 1948 and 1951 were made available recently and this material is used in indoctrination and coding studies.
Upon completion of coding, analysis of the files will begin, probably within one
month.

The clipping service has been initiated and approximately 350 clippings
have been received. The Life article is responsible for 90 per cent of the clippings, with the remainder being a few new sightings reported concurrently from
several sources. These clippings are reproduced here xerographically and the
originals are transmitted to the Sponsor.

Astronomer Jj has made no sightings himself, but agrees on the policy of reporting to a duly constituted panel if he should see any.

Astronomer KK has made no sightings and was not particularly interested in the problem.

Astronomer LL, Dr. La Paz, has already had so much publicity in Life magazine that there appears to be no reason for keeping his name secret. He is the Director of the Instituto of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico, and is cooperative in the extreme. One sighting of his has been described in Life magazine and also fully in OSI reports. He has made extensive reports about the green fireball sightings in New Mexico in OSI reports also.

The discussion of green fireballs with many astronomers disclosed that most of them were of the opinion that these were natural objects. However, close questioning revealed that they knew nothing of the actual sightings, of their frequency or anything much about them, and therefore cannot be taken seriously. This is characteristic of scientists in general when speaking about subjects which are not in their own immediate field of concern.

Dr. La Paz has seen only one green fireball himself, but has been avid in collecting reports on the others. Because his full reports are in the OSI files, only the salient points will be discussed here. It appears that the green fireballs can be characterized by being extremely bright, most of them lighting up the sky in the daytime, estimated magnitude -12, which is extremely bright. They appear to come in bunches and at one time 10 were observed in 13 days. No noise is associated with them despite their brightness. The

If the data as r ported by La Paz are correct, then we do have a strange phenomena here indeed.

Astronomer MW has not seen any. He happened to be with me, however, while I interviewed some laymen who had seen some aluminum-colored discs. He was most impressed by the consistency of their stories.

Astronomer MN is Clyde Tombaugh, who has already been identified in the Life article. He has made two sightings, the first of which is the one reported in Life magazine and the second was reported to me. The details can be obtained by sending him a questionnaire, as he is willing to cooperate.

Briefly, while at Telescope No. 3 at White Sands, he observed an object of -6 magnitude (four times brighter than the planet Venus at its brightest) travelling from the zenith to the southern horizon in about three seconds. The object executed the same maneuvers as the nighttime luminous object which was reported in Life magazine. No sound was associated with either of the sightings.

Mr. Tombaugh is in charge of optics design and rocket tracking at White Sands Proving Ground. He said that if he is requested officially, which can be done by a letter to the Commanding General, Flight Determination Laboratory, White Sands Proving Ground, Las Cruces, New Mexico, he will be able to put his telescopes at White Sands at the disposal of the Air Force. He can have observers alerted and ready to take photographs should some object appear. I strongly recommend that this letter be sent.

Astronomer OO is a meteor observer at the Harvard Meteor Station in New Mexico. Although relatively new on the job, he observed two lights while on watch at 1:30 a.m. that moved much too fast for a plane and much too slow

between 8:35 and 8:45 a.m. he noticed a disc-shaped object in the sky. It was flat and round like a flat plate. It appeared to be made of duralumin and gave off reflected light very similar to the light reflected from a highly polished airplane wing. The full details of his sighting are in my notes. I obtained his cooperation and he would be very glad to fill out an official questionnaire.

I also interviewed, while in Albuquerque, Mr. Redman and Mr. Morris, the two gentlemen whose picture appeared in Life magazine in the now-famous article on flying saucers. I questioned them separately and found that their stories were remarkably consistent. Indeed, since they viewed the object from widely different parts of the city, there is some possibility that the parallax of the object can be obtained by making theodolite sightings now on where the object appeared to them. The position of the object can be identified now because it was viewed close to a canyon in the mountains. Dr. La Paz has kindly offered to obtain the parallax of this object for us.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Over 40 astronomers were interviewed of which five had made sightings of one sort or another. This is a higher percentage than among the populace at large. Perhaps this is to be expected, since astronomers do, after all, watch the skies. On the other hand, they will not likely be fooled by balloons, aircraft, and similar objects, as may the general populace.

APPENDIX

While in Los Angeles, I was asked to appear in a TV program with Gerald Herd, the BBC science analyst; with Walter Riddel, the rocket expert; and with Aldous Huxley. They were to have a round-table discussion on flying saucers. I declined immediately but was prevailed upon to be in the studio when the program was in progress. I am afraid that my presence as an astronomer "cramped their style" to a great degree, but nonetheless the program had the general effect of convincing the hearers that flying saucers did exist. There was very little constructive about the program. It consisted of a rehash of all the things we have heard so much about already. It might be profitable, for instance, to have a TV program, sponsored by the Air Force, acquainting the public with the problem of flying saucers as a scientific problem. Though suggested jokingly, there might be some point to this, if this investigation ever gets to the scientific panel stage.

This report describes progress on this project for the period from August 11, 1952, to September 10, 1952.

Interrogation Forms

About 800 copies of the revised Tentative Observers Questionnaire, Exhibit A of the Fourth Status Report, dated August 11, 1952, were prepared and sent to ATIC. A great many of these were sent out by ATIC to observers to be filled out and returned. This was considered a "trial test" of the questionnaire.

More than 100 of the completed questionnaires have been returned to us. These are now being studied by Dr. Paul M. Fitts and his associates in the Aviation Psychology Department at Ohio State University. The final revisions of the questionnaire will be made as results of this study show that revisions are needed. The Final Observers Questionnaire is expected to be completed and sent to ATIC during September.

Analysis of Existing Sighting Reports

Work has continued on the coding of sighting reports to make possible an analysis by IBM machines. The reports for 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1951 are nearly completed. Considerable time was spent during August in conferences at which final evaluations were made on sightings for these years. These final evaluations were needed to put into the IBM system for use in future analysis.

The final evaluation conference was conducted by ATIC and our personnel. It is believed that this method of evaluation of sightings is adding greatly to the over-all analysis. It is, however, taking additional time.

It had previously been estimated that all of the backlog of files could be coded and placed in the IBM system by September 15, 1952. However, during the past few months, sighting reports have been accumulating at an unprecedented rate. In fact, the up-to-date 1952 file now contains nearly as many sightings as all previous years together. Therefore, the task of coding and analyzing the file has approximately doubled during recent months.

For this reason, considerably more time will be needed to put the sighting reports on a current basis and to complete the analysis. Some of the IBM cards are now being prepared and preliminary analyses are being started.

Newspaper Clipping Service

As requested by ATIC, an order has been issued to discontinue this service on October 1, 1952.

SIXTH STATUS REPORT

AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER

October 10, 1952

This report describes progress for the period from September 11, 1952, to October 10, 1952.

ANALYSIS OF EXISTING SIGHTING REPORTS

Work has continued on the coding of sighting reports to permit analysis by IBM machines. Reports up to and including 1951 are completed except for final evaluation of about 40 per cent of them. It is anticipated that final evaluation of all reports of sightings previous to 1952 will be completed during the month of October, in conference with ATIC personnel.

Therefore, by the end of October all sighting reports for the years 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, and 1951 will be ready as a group for preliminary analysis on IBM equipment.

Sighting reports for the first four months of 1952 were received late in September. Coding of these early 1952 reports was begun and should be completed, except for final evaluation, by October 20. Because the quality and quantity of information in many of the 1952 sighting reports has improved,

and in many cases more than one sighting is included in the folder, more time
was required for coding these reports than for earlier ones.

Because sighting reports accumulated at a rapid rate in May, June,
and July, 1952, and in general were more detailed than earlier reports, it is
estimated that it will require until the latter part of November, 1952, to
complete processing and evaluation of these reports for IBM analysis.

MISCELLANEOUS SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS

The panel of consultants was utilized during the month to advantage
on the following topics:

Analysis of Film

Two rolls of 35-mm spectrographic film and a section of gun-camera
spectrographic film, furnished by the Air Force for analysis, were examined
by experts on spectroscopy. After examination of the film, it was found im-
practical to proceed further with the analysis without more data. Although it
would be possible by indirect methods to arrive at limited conclusions regarding
the sources of light that were photographed, the expense would be prohibitive.
Further data needed for analysis of film should be derived from controlled
experiments using known sources of light, and from information on the following
factors:

1. Type of camera
2. Shutter speed

3. Aperture opening
4. Range
5. Type of grid used and details of grid construction
6. Type of film used

Simple standards could be established by which it should be possible to determine the source of light photographed with the camera and spectrographic equipment, at relatively little expense. It is believed that the camera and equipment will be most useful when the light is emitted by a single chemical element. If two or more elements are involved, analysis will be difficult with this simple recording device.

Soil and Vegetation Samples

During the month, two sets of soil and vegetation samples were studied by an agricultural specialist and by physicists.

Regarding the "Florida" samples, no difference was observed between the two samples of soil, but it was found that the root structure of the plants from the area in question was degenerated, apparently by heat, while the root structure of a control sample was undisturbed. In addition, the lower leaves, those nearest the ground under normal conditions, were slightly deteriorated, apparently by heat. No logical explanation is possible for this alteration of the first sample, beyond the suggestion that a high soil temperature around the plants could have been the cause. No radioactivity was found in any of these samples.

Regarding the "Kansas" samples, no difference was found between either the soil or the vegetation from the two areas from which the specimens were obtained. These samples are now being examined for radioactivity.

Consultant on Astronomy

Advice and assistance from Dr. J. Allen Hynek was received during the month concerning astronomical objects mistaken as "flying saucers". A few fundamental rules which had been given before were further elaborated.

Dr. Hynek also gave ten consulting hours to the task of improving the questions in the latest revised questionnaire.

INTERROGATION FORMS

During July, August, and September, Dr. Paul M. Fitts and associates of the Aviation Psychology Department of Ohio State University have served as consultants on the preparation of a questionnaire that would permit the United States Air Force to obtain a maximum of useful information from those persons who report sightings of unidentified aerial objects. Insofar as possible, the following criteria were used in designing the questionnaire:

1. To develop questions which could transfer from the observer to the U. S. Air Force as much detailed information as possible concerning the event, without the necessity of a personal interview.

UNCLASSIFIED

RESTRICTED
SECURITY INFORMATION
T52-12141

2. To develop questions that would permit some
evaluation of the accuracy and reliability
of the observer and his report.

3. To develop questions that could be:
(a) easily understood by a majority of the public,
(b) answered with minimum effort on the part of
the observer, and
(c) objectively and easily recorded, and transferred to an automatic machine filing system.

To meet the first criterion adequately, some questions were taken
from the first "Tentative Observer's Data Sheet". Suggestions and advice from
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Professor of Astronomy, Ohio State University, were
requested and used, and other questions, believed to be important and useful,
were devised. A copy of the second draft of the "Tentative Observer's Data
Sheet" is included as Exhibit I of this report. In general, most of the
questions in the second draft seem to fall in one of the following informational
categories:

1. When the event occurred, and where the observer
was located at the time of the sighting.

2. A description of the viewing conditions.

3. A description of the phenomenon itself.

The second draft of the "Tentative Observer's Data Sheet" was
designed for a trial test for selecting and improving questions for the final
questionnaire. Over 300 of these questionnaires were sent to observers by ATIC.
Replies to 168 of them were analyzed. On the basis of this analysis, a

summary of these replies is included in Exhibit I of this report. A new questionnaire, the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet", has been designed, in which several questions were omitted, some were revised, and others added. As an example, it was found that many observers were unable to reply to the question which asked for an estimation of the "real" size of the object. This question was restated in the form of an "apparent" size.

A sample of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" is given as Exhibit II of this report. Form A is for specific data, and Form B is for a short verbal summary expressed in the observer's own words.

Multiple-choice questions, completion questions, and drawings are used throughout the final questionnaire so as to get as accurate a description as possible. The multiple-choice question is well adapted for use in large-scale statistical studies.

The second criterion used in preparing the questionnaire is most difficult to achieve. As far as possible, questions were worded to provide a check on the consistency and competence of the observer.

The best check of consistency would be to have the observer answer the questionnaire twice with an interval of time separating the two replies. Since this is not practical, it was decided that the next best way would be to have the observer fill in an objective multiple-choice section and, in addition, write out a summary description in a summary data sheet. Any obvious discrepancies between information given in this description and that given in the questionnaire would make the observer's replies questionable.

An evaluation of the observer's personality traits and mental competence is likewise difficult to achieve in such a questionnaire. In addition

RESTRICTED

                                        -7-

to the low validity of standardized questionnaires specifically designed to
test these aspects of the individual, the restriction exists that the observer
should not detect that his competence is being considered. In spite of the
limitations, it was decided to include several questions which might operate
indirectly to reveal any severely abnormal factors. Two questions (No. 24 and
No. 38) were inserted for the specific purpose of detecting replies of the
fanatic and over-imaginative individual. A reasonable assumption is that the
person who uses fantastic explanations and descriptions, and who appears to be
convinced that the sighting was produced by unknown creatures or interplanetary
visitors, is not likely to be a discerning observer. It is further proposed
that such individuals will be prone to fabricate details, and suffer severe
memory distortions when recounting the event.

Questions Nos. 5.1 and 22.1 are intended to indicate the over-anxious
respondent. With the exception of a few instances in which accurate measure-
ments may be made, normally one would not expect an observer to be "certain"
that he had seen an object for a specific time or of a specific apparent size.
Again, these types of data can be subjected to controlled experimentation in
which observers make estimates of duration and of size, together with certainty
ratings.

Question No. 26 is an important question if No. 36.1 receives a
negative reply, and if the duration of the sighting were of sufficient length
that one could reasonably expect other observers also to see the object. If
this is the case, then one would suspect that the sighting was a result of
individual factors.

An effort was made to satisfy the third criterion for the questionnaire
by using simple language and nontechnical terminology. It is recognized that

RESTRICTED
SECURITY INFORMATION                UNCLASSIFIED

this requirement would not permit many trained observers (scientists, pilots, etc.) to present important technical data, therefore it is recommended that a different questionnaire be used or that different channels be employed for communicating with this select group of individuals.

Whenever possible, the questions were written in multiple-choice form, so that they could be easily answered and accurately recorded. If it appeared that too many categories would be needed to cover all possible responses, or if the categories would lead to doubtful or erroneous interpretation, then the question was worded so that the observer could fill in his own answer. A large number of the questions permit the observer to give a "Don't Know" or a "Don't Remember" response, and thus do not force a guess or an incorrect answer.

It was decided that the observer should be asked to circle the correct answer to the multiple-choice items, thereby allowing minimum ambiguity in the instructions and maximum objective scoring. Systems such as checking or underlining the correct answer are often misinterpreted by the respondent because of previous experience with various ambiguous checking and "X-ing" systems, such as voting procedures.

It is anticipated that when a sufficient sample of replies has been received from the second questionnaire that further minor revisions will appear necessary.

FUTURE WORK

One-thousand copies of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" (Form A and Form B) will be printed and made available to ATIC in the near future.

Results of tests for radiation on the "Kansas" soil and vegetation sample will be completed.

The coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports will continue, and analysis of these reports will be started using the IBM system. Final evaluation, in conference with ATIC personnel, will be completed on all remaining unevaluated sighting reports dated before 1952.

A preliminary analysis of the existing report file has been completed. Information derived from this analysis has been applied in improving the present interrogation form. A Tentative Observer's Data Sheet has been prepared and studied by the consultants' panel. Pertinent suggestions were incorporated in the tentative form, which is enclosed for review in Section I. The revised data sheet now includes all technical details thought to be essential. It is to be evaluated next by an astronomer, a psychologist, and a CAB investigator. Arrangements for their evaluations are now being made.

The facts reported in present files or on new sightings are to be entered on the observer's data sheet. This information will not be coded for direct entry on punched cards. Instead, the facts will be classified and analyzed before entries are made on the punched cards.

To facilitate this process, a coding scheme has been prepared to serve as an intermediate step between the data sheet and the punched card. A copy is enclosed in Section I.

The final element in the data record is the punched card on which the results of coded calculations and analyses are entered. A copy of a typical card is also enclosed in Section I.

Newspaper accounts of sightings furnished by the clipping service are being received at approximately a constant rate; however, the Life article is now responsible for only about half of the clippings.

Originally, the clippings were copied at Battelle, and then transmitted to the Sponsor. In the future, the clippings will be sent directly to the Sponsor by Battelle.
