0

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observations of object originating the moon at an average of every 6 minutes during October and November 59. Reported in 1956.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
Orbit seen in 6 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual (TV)

COMMENTS: Moon under observation by astronomers during this period failed to substantiate appearance of an object orbiting the moon. Is believed that no other such object exists, crossed the path of the telescope view during this period such as during the Dade, Fla., period, leaves not well understood whether natural phenomena or objects.

ATTN OF: TDEM

21 Apr 65

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-CC (Mr. [redacted])
Wash D C 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from [redacted] requesting information on unidentified flying object observed by himself and a friend on 8 Oct - 9 Nov 59.

2. No object such as described by them has been reported in any of the scientific literature associated with studies of the moon. It is possible that the Smithsonian Institute estimated their speed as 70,000 mph, assuming a certain altitude above the moon surface, in which cases, a computed speed would now be possible. Copies of your reported observation have been forwarded to Dr J Allen Hynek, Astronomical Consultant, to Project Blue Book. To our knowledge no other report of this nature has been received by Project Blue Book. We are returning the cards, belonging to [redacted], as requested.

Sir:

I wish to thank you for the copy of Blue Book Report which I requested. However, I noticed on page 5 last paragraph that all sightings were no longer in your possession.

The purpose of my inquiry is to find out if on any date which I and a close friend of mine saw from October 8, 1957 - January 7, 1959 was reported. We both another astronomer and I was many copies of our sightings during these 33 days. I realize that this was almost 6 years ago but my friend and I felt to at this point should have been reported. Our reasons are not reporting it

April 5, 1965

Here is the OCR text from the document:

then are numerous but this object was minute.
It was circumstance and I am clear to a
great deal more accurate and the object in
1959 went to the Smithsonian Institute
and related to them only the time of orbit 16 min.
But they replied that for a Comsat orbit it is
hard to give 16 min mile per hour. Evidently they
did not take me seriously for in both Paul's
school and mine we so have a path probably
and physics and common sense to know that
it would be impossible to obtain a speed instant
throwing a distance. I have done my many
various types of possible orbits and each
was not different that a set distance is important
to obtain, only a large interval. I have
enclosed one of our copies of our records 8x5
cards. I call your attention to these last
UFO's were reported in 59 and a view to my
question in 59 on the cards I am certain of my
findings and I have many things about the
subject. I would be more than happy to
think on the record we of the object.
I readily read your style is quite busy and
I appreciate your interest a great deal. This
active discovery may be of more significance

but 7th -- and I have? I will go on looking as we are and if your office no longer has the regards of '59 I would appreciate it very much if I could find out where I could obtain such information. On review of our own program at present I find rather delicate to report our findings -- as was fantastic as they seem, they are true. Thank you for your time.

With sincere respects,

FILE 8-9

PROPERTY OF [redacted]

THE OCCURRENCE OF LUNAR 8
DATE: October 8 - November 9, 1959
PLACE OF OBSERVATION: Mobile, Alabama
October 8- satellite found orbiting moon by [redacted]

TIME: Between 6:8 P.M.
Phase of moon: First Quarter (according to world almanac of 1959) (exactly 1/4 quarter)
DIRECTION: Satellite traveled West to East
(rim toward dark side)

The satellite passed over the crater Copernicus on the way around. Impossible to determine whether the object or its shadow was being observed. In either case the object appeared as large as the crater Copernicus (50 miles in diameter)

Average time of orbit was 6 minutes; time varied slightly from one orbit to the next
The object was seen every night that wea-

ther permitted for a period of 33 days

On November 9 the satellite either greatly increased its speed or was pursued by another object of similar likeness as a double image was seen. The object then disappeared and has not been seen since.

A letter of inquiry to the Smithsonian Institute revealed they had not seen the object; however they said that such an object

Here is the text from the document:

would have to be traveling at 70,000 miles
per hour and remote controlled. As I gave
them only the time of orbit(I could compute
nothing else), I am at a loss to under-
stand their basis for this figure.

I confirmed [redacted] findings; the object was
also seen by my parents.
I along saw the satellite's disappearance;
[partially redacted text]
To date there is no indication of its origin
