The text in the image appears to be mostly illegible due to poor image quality and what seems to be an encoded or encrypted format. Some partial text is visible, such as:

At the top of the page: 
"HOME" appears multiple times
"NONE" appears multiple times

At the bottom of the page:
- A handwritten date: 9/06/12
- A handwritten number: 24
- Some codes/reference numbers: "RC682", "MO WPC072 YDD085 YXAI14 XDBB6SDMB@61"

The majority of the text in the middle of the document is not clearly readable and appears to be in some form of encoded text or cipher.
