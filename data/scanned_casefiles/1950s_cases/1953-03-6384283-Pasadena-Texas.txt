AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

At 0355 Z, Lt R K Smith called Base Operations and reported seeing a flying object over Pasadena, Texas. (See inclosures for 1st R K Smith's statement). Base Operations per Sgt Liggett, T/Sgt Liggett, A/1c Graves, and A/1c Olden of the 7447th AC & W Sq observed the object reported and made the following statement.

"We immediately Radar scanned the area and could not locate the object electronically. We went out side and sighted the object in a sector believed to be over Pasadena, Texas. The object showed a steady reading light, with was not observed to change in color. The object was on a heading of approximately 355° to 040° degrees from this base ranging from 12 to 25 miles. The object made five circles over Pasadena, then went off in a NNW direction. The object was sighted visually at 0415 Z, 24th March 1953. At 0412 Z the object was sighted on the radar screen a screen at this station. It was present for about 25 seconds which did not provide time to take a picture of the blip. At 0435 Z, 24 March 1953, this station notified 745th AC & W Sq that the object was headed in their direction."

Release of weather balloons at approximately the time of the sighting from Ellington AFB, Texas.

One weather balloon was released from Ellington AFB, Texas at 0815 Z, 23 March 1953, Climbed at a rate of a 1000 ft per min and rose to approximately 52,000 ft. A 2nd balloon was released and climbed at the rate of 1000 ft per min.

This is the track of the two Weather balloons

From surface to 5,000 ft track was SW due to NE wind at 10 Knots.
From 5,000 to 10,000 ft track was NW due to SW wind at 40 Knots.
From 10,000 ft to 18,000 ft track was NW due to SE wind at 50 Knots.
From 18000 ft to 23,000 ft track was NW due to SE wind at 80 Knots.

Weather balloons released after dark carry a 6 volt battery, which powers a small white light. This cannot be seen 12,000 feet. A picture included which shows a watcher balloon shot approximately 12,000 feet. There are no facilities at this station to take photographs after dark.

Visual observation of weather balloons ascensions has disclosed that the suspended radiosonde occasionally considerably in rough air. Since the radiosonde is lighted at night it is considered possible that this oscillation might be misconstrued as the orbited movement of an unknown aerial object.

The statement of T/Sgt. Patrick D. Liggett, AF 17096050, 
AO & W Supervisor, at this station, is as follows:

On the night of March 23, 1953 at approximately 04102, I 
observed a strange object which was over Pasadena, Texas at the time 
of the sighting. It was a constant light moving in a large clear 
over the city. The object seemed to be the same drill "on color at 
all time's and did not change. The estimated speed was 300 to 350 
knots at 15,000ft. The object seemed to come left and then to the 
right. We at this station picked-up object on our scope, the object 
was on the scope for three (3) sweeps at 6 inch. with the antenna 
tilt at 20° it was about the same size as any blip at that range, 
the object was heading north at 12 miles.

Statement of Leonard Duresse, A/3c, Air Police Section, 747th 
AO & W Squadron.

On the 23 March 1953 between the hours of 2030 and 2200 while 
on duty at the Gate house, I noticed in the sky northwest of the 
site, an object oval in shape that gave off light the color of a 
star. I could not identify the object, but it resembled somewhat 
a happening that occurred approximately five nights before; however 
on the first night the object possessed more characteristics. The 
object traveled at an unstable rate of speed and the light flashed 
on and off. It seemed to stop at scattered intervals and it could 
not be traced after entering a path of light given off by a search 
light.

The happenings that occurred on the first night I could not ac-
credit to any source. The happenings that occurred on the 23 March 
I supposed to be the result of the weather station behind the site.
