Transcribing the text from the document:

On Sunday afternoon, 5 October 1952, about 4:30 A.M., my wife and I were returning home from a football game, and perhaps it was a twilight ray, but the sky was not quite dark. I called my wife to take a look at it. She did so, and also had a puzzled look on her face. The object was quite bright and seemed to be hovering, or making a very slow movement. It appeared to be a large oval, silver in color, and absolutely soundless. There were no blinking lights or means of propulsion visible. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and 10 to 15 feet thick. After watching it for about 5 minutes, it suddenly took off at a terrific speed, straight up, and disappeared in the sky. This was observed from a moving automobile, and I am quite certain that we were not hallucinating. The object was definitely a strange and puzzling sight to us, and I should like to know if any other reports of a similar nature were received from this area at that time.

It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page discusses two dates that are mentioned as possibly being the sighting of an object, and the writer states that their wife saw the object in November and they saw it in October.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

22 March from Maxwell AFBASE. I wouid about northern a few minutes after 9:10 there. 

The information I have given on my information is any tions that may come is informed upon regarding documents or information as much as they possibly can. 

The two dates that appear as to seeing the object are unrelated. My wife saw it in November and I saw it in October. If you have experience of reports from MAT-93 to verify the dates the object was observed, would indicate clearly the date.

REPORT NO.: 1-52
DATE: 11/9/52

1. The following information was furnished the Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF. This is a preliminary report to amplify the initial report of sighting submitted at the time of the sighting. 

An Vic Robert Hammond, the tower operator at Titusville, reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object while on duty at the Tower. He stated that he first observed the object at approximately 1030 hours CST, while in the tower. The object was at an estimated altitude of approximately 4,000 feet and was traveling in a NNE direction. It appeared to be moving much faster than any conventional aircraft and was observed for a period of a few seconds and disappeared. Hammond stated that the object appeared to be shiny and round, but gave no further details. 

CHECKS:
2. Checks were made with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel, Mobile, Alabama District Office, regarding the sighting. They stated they had no aircraft or other objects in the air in that area at the time of the sighting. Headquarters, Third AF, Greenville, S.C., where no planes were known to be flying in the area. It has not been possible to locate the object mentioned in the report as having been observed.

3. The weather conditions prevailing during the sightings was CAVU, visibility unlimited, which tends to rule out unusual activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise. 

4. No fighter interception action for identification purposes was taken.

5. ACAM unit reported nothing unusual on its radar scope during time of incident.

6. Airman Hammond has been in the USAF approximately 11 months, serving in the capacity of a tower operator at all times.

Air Intelligence Information Report

Country: USA
Report No.: 1
Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED IN THE VICINITY OF AUBURN, ALABAMA AND COLUMBUS, GEORGIA

Date of Intelligence: 23 November 1952
Date of Information: 22 November 1952

The unidentified flying object was sighted in the vicinity of Auburn, Alabama and Columbus, Georgia on 23 November 1952. The details of the observation are as follows:

1. Summary of Sighting: The unidentified flying object was sighted in the vicinity of Auburn, Alabama and Columbus, Georgia on 23 November 1952 at approximately 1715 EST. All observers agreed it showed two (2) bright spots of light on its surface. The object was stationary for approximately 2 hours and then started moving slowly to the east.

2. Tentative Identification of the Object: The object can be broken down into three (3) categories: (1) meteorite, (2) satellite, or (3) an intelligently controlled object. Based on the data, only one possibility is entertained by this HQ of the local GIG contends that the object was a "Vagor." Those concerned state the object would remain very bright accompanied by a very rapid motion, and then disappear completely. This description does not coincide with the descriptions of the circumstances surrounding the observation.

3. Evaluation of the Incident: Four (4) persons did see an object which they did estimate as follows: (1) 2000-7000', (2) 250-300 feet in diameter, (3) and had a duration of 2 hours. The object was observed with binoculars and the naked eye. It had two bright spots of light that appeared to be portholes, with luminous patches around them and a faint glow from the southwest at 15-20 knots. The object was "in and out."

Analysis: One said it appeared about 12-15 feet in diameter, the other about 8-10 feet in diameter. Some said it appeared to be oval or circular in shape. It made no sound. However, only one estimate included both size and altitude. That was given by the observer and his altitude estimated the size at approximately 2000 feet, which seems reasonable.

In addition to observers' statements, two (2) observer postscripts are attached. Dr. D, a Professor of Psychology at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, claimed he never thought of it being anything else other than a real object, passing through a very high altitude at very high speed, estimated about 10,000 feet.

The majority of the observers interviewed by this HQ were so vague and under the impression that the sighting could be accounted for easily, securing their signed statements. With the exception of Lt Col. Birkles' statement, there is no evidence to indicate that a closer examination of the type of the object could be secured.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
COLUMBIA FIELD OFFICE
Reg. No. - 52-2
DATE COI-A.:LETED l 2 NOV 1952
IN RR: STUDENT SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT, AUBURN, ALABAMA, 9 NOVEMBER 1952
On 9 November 1952, R. L. C., a student at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, was returning to his apartment in Auburn, Alabama, at approximately 7:30 PM when he saw a bright light in the northwest sky. The light appeared to change color and move in a circular fashion. He watched the object for about five minutes and then saw it disappear 
R. L. C. reported this incident to the authorities at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the incident was reported to the Air Force Investigator. 
The Air Force Investigator interviewed R. L. C. and was informed that the object was a bright light, approximately the size of a dime held at arm's length, that changed color from white to orange and back again as it moved in a circular fashion. The object disappeared suddenly, straight up and out of sight. 
The Air Force Investigator checked the area for any known aircraft activity, military or civilian, and was unable to determine the nature of the object. There were no other reports of the sighting from the area.
The Air Force Investigator concludes that, based on the information available, the object sighted could not be identified as any known type of aircraft or other explainable phenomenon. The incident is classified as an "unidentified" object.

HEADQUARTERS
434TH TROOP CARRIER GROUP (M)
Lawson Air Force Base
Fort Benning, Georgia

17:45 EST 14 November 1952

STATEMENT

1. I landed at Lawson AFB at 17:05 EST 6 November 1952 after a flight from Campbell AFB, Tennessee. I parked and had just become prevalent in the Lawson AFB area, restricting lateral visibility to an estimated three (3) miles. I noticed and observed (VFR) air station and found that the top of the base was 3,500' to 4,000' MSL and so reported it to Columbia (Ga.) Radio.

2. Approximately 1/2 hour later EST I was traveling up Indianhead Road on Lawson AFB in an automobile with four (4) other officers. The officer driving the automobile had just arrived at Lawson AFB from Campbell AFB in another aircraft within the preceding hour. While looking out and up at the base and smoke he noticed an object in the sky which appeared to be about the size of a basketball. The object was motionless and remained so for approximately one (1) minute. The object was WWW of our position and at an elevation of about 60 degrees. The object was visible and of a variable intensity.

3. The object was intermittently visible above the haze but was moving slowly. The object was all I: estimated the altitude of the object at 4,000 feet to 7,000 feet MSL.

4. Official sunset at Lawson AFB was at 17:45 EST on 8 November 52. The object was shining as with reflected sunlight and appeared to be round. It appeared to be a large weather balloon of the type used for atmospheric soundings and I dismissed it from my mind as such until later contacted by the Intelligence Officer, USAFSS-TROOPS, Carroll Wing.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

STATEMENT

Immediately after the football game between Mississippi State and Alabama, 9 November 1952, a group of us (approximately 15) were standing outside the east gate of the stadium and within a few minutes a large shiny object surrounded by a halo appeared to be the size and shape of a solid head of a thumb held at arm's length. This object appeared to be the size and shape of a solid head of a thumb held at arm's length. This object appeared to be silvery in appearance. We observed this object while we walked a distance (7 or 8 blocks) to our car and intermittently while we drove to Opelika. Upon our arrival at Opelika (about 18 miles), we stopped at a cafe. We called the airport in Auburn and the object was confirmed to be of a strange nature. This object remained hovering and this object became less distinctive and the silvery color appeared to take on a yellow appearance. Upon departure from this restaurant it was gone and we could find no sight of this object.

The weather was clear and ceiling and visibility appeared unlimited although there was indication of smoke in the air.

On several occasions I sighted this object under the rim of my glasses and by holding my hand at arm's length this object appeared at all times this object was visible.

While observing this object at Auburn, Alabama, I did notice one or two aircraft that appeared to be headed for Montgomery, Alabama. It is believed that these aircraft were civilian airlines D-C-3 type.

The attached chart indicates our position and the position of the object when it was first observed by our party.

SUBJECT: Flying object sighted at Auburn, Alabama on 9 November
While at the Auburn-Mississippi State football game here on 8 November, it was observed an object flying at 5500 feet (approximately). This object appeared to be moving very slowly, and at times would start and stop suddenly, all the time maintaining a very straight course. About 1830 CST (approximately 1620 EST) a group of AFROTC students saw the same thing and many reported it as a weather balloon.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a blurry, elongated object in the sky. The report describes this object as a "silvery balloon" that was observed during a football game in Auburn, Alabama on November 8, 1952. The observer watched the object for about fifteen minutes and noted that it remained stationary with very little motion despite the wind.

However, because of the altitude it appeared to the eye as a flat object about 14 inches in diameter. The wind was still and there was very little motion of the object. I observed the object for about fifteen minutes and it was in its original position when I left the stadium. The time of this was about four-thirty in the afternoon G.C.T...
