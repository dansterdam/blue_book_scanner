DATE: 6 December 1952

On Saturday afternoon, 3 October 1952, about 4:30 P.M., my wife and I were returning home from a football game and I looked up into the sky and saw a bright object. I thought perhaps it was a bright star, but the sky was well to light for stars to appear, and the object was too large for any star.

I called my wife to take a look at it, she did so, and also stated it was too large for a star. She told me to call McQuell AF Base, Ala. and notify them. I did so and some of the questions here on this questionnaire were asked me. The object was about as bright as a cars headlight a mile away, or observed from a flying aircraft. I watched it for approximately 20 minutes, but it did not appear to move any certain direction but was stationary. It was a hazy afternoon, but the object was still bright regardless of the condition of the sky. I went into the house and later returned outdoors to go to the store. The object appeared to be smaller and growing dimmer as if it were moving away further into the sky. (This was approximately 30 minutes later) When I returned from the store, the object was gone. This was about 5 or 5:30 P.M.

When I was talking to the Officer (name unknown) at McQuell AF Base, she asked me in what direction did I believe the object was.

it was from maxwell AFBase. I was at about northeast or about half of a 90° triangle

This questionnaire has been filled out to the best of my knowledge for your information. If there is any question that may come into mind after reading this report, please notify me and I will be happy to comment further as much as I possibly can.

The two dates that appear as to seeing the object are undecided. My wife says in November and I state in October. If you have incidence of a report from MAFB to verify the date the object was reported, it will clear clarify the date.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: (Origr) Dir/Int, NSAC                 Report No. IR-62-52         Page 2 of 2 Pages

1. The following information was furnished the Director of Intelligence, Northeast Air Command by the Base Intelligence Officer, Thule AB, Greenland.

2. A/1C Robert Hammond, the tower operator at Thule, reported the sighting of an unconventional aerial object at approximately 0730Z 8 November 1952. During an interval of approximately three (3) minutes during the time of the sighting, the sighting lasted for a period of a few seconds and appeared as a bright, flame-like object which a long flare tail. It appeared to originate from the general vicinity of the eastern edge of South Mountain which is approximately three (3) miles from the Thule tower. The object appeared to rise from ground behind the hill, shooting up rapidly at an angle of approximately 30° to the horizon on a southward path and vanishing or burning out at an estimated altitude of 1,500 feet.

3. As quoted by the airman, "it looked like the trail of a jet". The attached inclosure illustrates its physical characteristics as it appeared to Airman Hammond. The trail of the object appeared to be generally solid in a flame-like end.

4. Checks were made with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel, North Atlantic Construction (NAC) Security Police and the Air Police at Thule. Air Police stated that it is possible some of the NAC personnel may have had flares. In their possession, however, Headquarters, Thule AB, as yet has been unable to locate the civilian who heard report of sighting the same object. Corps of Engineer personnel stated that NAC Security Police, who maintain a patrol in the area of sighting, indicated that nothing had been found to indicate an object emanating from the area.

5. The area in which the sighting appeared to originate is approximately four (4) miles from the nearest coast line.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer

1. The weather conditions prevailing during the sightings was CAVU, visibility 25 miles, temperature -60°F, winds were from ESE at 10 knots.

2. There was no unusual activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

3. No fighter interception action for identification purposes was taken.

4. AC&W unit reported nothing unusual on its radar scope during time of incident.

5. Base Operations indicated no inbound or outbound aircraft at the time of the sighting.

6. Airman Hammond has been in the USAF approximately 11 months, serving in the capacity of a tower operator at all times.

SUMMARY (Give only the basic facts paragraph. List enclosures in lower left. Begin last line of report as AF Form 112 - see file)

1. The unidentified flying object sighted in the vicinity of Auburn, Ala. and Columbus, Ga. on 18 Nov 1952 was described, with some variations, as a large, round, oval or spherical body of a silver or aluminum color. It was sighted in both areas at approximately 1715 EST. All observers agreed it showed two (2) bright spots or light on its surface. Almost all thought the light to be reflected but one observer is convinced it was emanating from within. Some wouldn't hazard an opinion one way or the other.

2. Tentative identification of the object can be broken down into three (3) categories: (1) unknown, (2) "flying saucer", (3) weather balloon. To date, only one person interviewed by this Hqs was a local Columbus, Ga. school teacher who saw a "saucer". Those who cannot say what the object was usually render a very vague account of what they saw. Persons maintaining the object was a balloon are, in the main, those whose overall description of the circumstances surrounding the observation is most lucid.

3. Few persons gave an estimate of the object's altitude other than "it was very high". Four (4) persons did give concrete estimates as follows: (1) 4000-7000', (2) 5500', (3) 10,000', (4) 5-6 miles. Weather conditions at the time were good: ceiling 32,000', overcast with solid at 1500' to 4000', visibility 4-5 miles with light smoke and haze, wind from the southwest at 15-20 knots. The sun was 14° in and out.

4. Only two (2) of the observers estimated the size of the object. One said it appeared about 12-15 feet in diameter, the other about 8-10 feet in diameter. Some said it was perhaps 12 feet in diameter at a very visible altitude. Still others said it appeared to be about 12" in diameter as it hovered in the sky. However, only one estimate included both size and altitude. That was given by Lt. Boyne, AROTC Instructor at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, who estimated the size as 12 to 15 feet in diameter and altitude as about 5500'.

5. In addition to observers whose statements are attached, two (2) observers positively identified the object as a balloon. Dr Carr, professor of Physics at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, claimed he never thought of its being anything else. Another observer, viewing it through a pair of binoculars (approximately 10X), claimed its altitude at about 10,000'.

6. The majority of the observers interviewed by this Hqs were so vague and uncertain in recounting their experience that it was difficult to draw any conclusions. With the exception of Lt Col Brickles statement, those observers with fairly clear recollections of the type of info that could be secured from observers with fairly clear recollections of what they saw.

Executive Officer in Charge of Officer Candidate Evaluation, 1st Air Force, Tactical Air Command, Registrar, The Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia was contacted with a request for information.

2. Lt. Col. and Col. I stated that while all of Columbus, Ga. were returning from Auburn, Alabama on the evening of 9 November 1952, they noticed something along the road causing them to stop their vehicle. People along the road gazing into the sky also stopped their vehicles. According to the source, they observed an object in the sky which appeared to be a bright light.

The object appeared to be oval or saucer-shaped and was stationary. It was bright and seemed to have a glow around it. The largest size in the view was about the size of a half-dollar at arm's length. The light definition came from a bright light which seemed to have no identifiable shape.

This object that I have attempted to draw was sighted, November 8, 1952 at approximately 5:00 P. m. Central Standard Time, from Auburn, Alabama.

I watched this object for possibly a full ten minutes. It was very, very high and never seemed to move. It was at approximately a forty, or forty-five degree angle and at a south or south easterly direction.

This object appeared to be shaped somewhat like a balloon with a diameter of some eight to twelve feet. It had a silver or an aluminum color.

After looking at this object for about ten minutes I entered an automobile and drove east toward Opelika, Alabama, stopping along the way to observe it more. At some positions along the highway where I stopped, there appeared to be two bright lights inside of this object, (which I have attempted to draw inside of this object.)

After arriving in Opelika just before dark, I could still see it. After some twenty minutes inside of a Cafe, I came out and found this object was not visible anymore.

                                        STATEMENT

1. I landed at Lawson AFB at 1705 EST 8 November 1952 after a flight from Campbell AFB, Kentucky. Smoke and haze were prevalent in the Lawson AFB area, restricting lateral visibility to an estimated three (3) miles. I noted on letdown (VFR) at Lawson AFB that the top of the haze was 3500' to 4,000' MSL and so reported 1st to Command (Sa.) Radio.

2. At approximately 1735 EST I was traveling up Indianhead Road on Lawson AFB in an automobile with four (4) other officers. The officer driving the automobile had also arrived at Lawson AFB from Campbell AFB in another aircraft within the preceding hour. While looking out and up the haze and smoke he noted an object in the sky and stopped the car. No one left the vehicle but the driver and myself watched the object for approximately one (1) minutes. The object was WNW or northeast and at an elevation of about 60 degrees. The haze and smoke was wispy and of a variable intensity. The object was intermittently visible above the haze but was moving slowly if at all. I estimate the altitude of the object at 4000 feet to 7000 feet MSL.

3. Official sunset at Lawson AFB was at 1745 EST on 8 November 52. The object was shining as with reflected sunlight and appeared to be round. It appeared to be a large weather balloon of the type used for atmospheric soundings and I dismissed it from my mind as such until contacted by the Intelligence Officer, 436th Troop Carrier Wing.

STATEMENT

Immediately after the football game between Mississippi State and API, Saturday 8 November 1952 at Auburn, Alabama, and I walked out of the East end of the API stadium and within a few minutes after leaving the stadium, Mr. noticed a peculiar object in the air in the Southeast direction. This object appeared to be the same and shape of a solid head coach with a distinctive silvery appearance. We observed this object while we walked 4 or 5 blocks to our car and intermittently while we drove to Opelika, Alabama, (7 miles). Upon our arrival at Opelika, we stopped at a cafe (Green) and the object was still visible, with no noticeable change in the appearance. While we were observing this object, prior to entering the restaurant, the sun seemed to be setting and this object became less distinct and the silvery color appeared to take on a yellow appearance.

Upon departure from this restaurant it was dark and we could find no sight of this object.

The weather was clear and ceiling and visibility appeared unlimited although there was indication of smoke in the air.

On several occasions I sighted this object under the rim of my glasses and by holding my hand at arm's length. At all times this object appeared to be motionless.

While observing this object at Auburn, Alabama, I did notice one or two aircraft that appeared to be headed for Montgomery, Alabama. It is believed that these aircraft were civilian airlines DC-3 type.

The attached chart indicates our position and the position of the object when it was first observed by our party.

SUBJECT: Flying object sighted at Auburn, Alabama on 8 November

While at the Auburn-Mississippi State Football game here on 8 November, I observed an object flying at 5500 feet (approximately). This object appeared to be moving very slowly and I identified it as a large weather balloon, perhaps 12 or 15 feet in diameter. At the same time (about 1630 CST) a group of AFROTC students saw the same thing and many reported it as a weather balloon.

To Whom It May Concern:

While observing a football game in Auburn, Ala. on the 8th day of November 1952, I followed the gaze of other spectators and saw in the sky immediately to the East of the stadium and high in the sky an object that appeared to me to be a silver balloon. However, because of the altitude it appeared to the eye as a flat object about 14 inches in diameter. The wind was still and there was very little motion of the object. I observed the object for about fifteen minutes and it was in its original position when I left the stadium. The time of this was about four-thirty in the afternoon C.S.T.
