AREA INFORMATION ON: A CONSTANCE
DATE OF REPORT: 22 February 1952
SUMMARY: This report discusses a sighting of a bright light in the sky over Norwalk, Connecticut on 29 April 1952. The light was seen by several people and was investigated by the local police. The report provides details about the sighting and the investigation.

The image does not contain any visible photographs or images. It appears to be a page from an old document or report titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT". The text on the page contains details about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred on 8 September 1952 in Norwalk, Connecticut.

Here is the text from the document:

AIR FORM 112 - PART II 
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DATE: 8 September 1952
PLACE: Norwalk, Conn.
TIME: 1900 (EST) 

1. On 8 September 1952, Mr. T. P. (full name deleted), a resident of Norwalk, Conn., reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object. Mr. T. P. stated to this investigator that on the evening of 8 September 1952, at approximately 1900 (EST), he and his wife observed a lighted object in the sky which he could not identify. Mr. T. P. stated that the object appeared to be oval in shape and was traveling at a high rate of speed. He stated that the object was at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet and was traveling in a northeasterly direction. Mr. T. P. said that the object was visible for approximately 15 seconds and that it appeared to change color from white to orange as it proceeded on its course. He stated that the object made no sound and that he was unable to determine the size of the object.

2. On 8 September 1952, the reporting officer contacted the Federal Aviation Administration and was advised that there were no scheduled flights or known air traffic in the Norwalk area at the time of the reported sighting. The FAA was unable to offer any explanation for the reported object.

3. This case is of interest due to the fact that the witness is a reliable person and the description of the object is similar to many other unidentified flying object reports. However, due to the lack of physical evidence and the inability to determine the size, altitude, and speed of the object, no conclusive determination can be made as to the nature of the reported sighting.

The report describes observations of an unidentified aerial object seen near Norwalk, Connecticut. The object was described as being cigar-shaped, silver in color, and hovering at a high altitude. The report also mentions that the object appeared to be rotating and that it was visible for several minutes before disappearing from sight.

The report provides details about the sighting, including the date, time, location, and observations of the witnesses. It also notes that the object was observed by multiple witnesses and that the sighting was reported to the Air Force.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

OCT (0) 57 Broad St.
NORWALK, CONN.
21-0-164

PAGE 1 OF 5 PAGES

"Girl" finished staining model ship. The information was revised that this "girl" related that she had been walking on the beach near 5:30 PM on 27 September 1952 when she observed a metallic, silvery disc-shaped object which made a sudden ascent from the water and flew off rapidly. She said the object was about 25 feet in diameter, was hovering about 75 feet above the water and made no noise. After it ascended rapidly, it was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. She said it left no vapor trail, no exhaust, and no sign of propulsion. She said that during the time she observed this object, approximately 1 to 2 minutes, a boat which was about 1/4 mile off shore also observed the object as it ascended rapidly.

The reporting officer stated that the subject was very calm, rational, and lucid in her story and that he could find no reason to doubt her sincerity or credibility. He stated that the girl appeared to be intelligent, honest, and quite positive in her description of the incident.

The reporting officer also stated that at the time this incident occurred there was a 12 to 15 knot wind blowing onshore and surface waves about 2 to 3 feet high, and that the object appeared to rise vertically from the surface of the water.

He concluded his report by stating that this incident constitutes a good sighting of a UAO (Unidentified Aerial Object) which he believes deserves further study and investigation.

Connecticut. Mother of the witness had seen the object at close range; that she was very frightened and firmly believes it was a strange circular aircraft not at all like any known type. She stated that about three (3) days after her daughter had seen the object, she saw it again from the window of her home and that it was moving very slowly and silently across the sky, making no noise whatsoever. She stated that it was about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length and was luminous or illuminated. She further stated that it appeared to be about the size of a medium-sized piper cub aircraft, and when it passed in front of the moon it obscured a portion of the moon. It had no wings, tail, or other visible means of propulsion, and gave no indication of any exhaust or trail of any kind. It simply glided silently across the sky.

12. Attached as paragraphs are a drawing of object, prepared by special agent, and a map showing the location of the sighting, Connecticut, should of course be considered as unknown objects, correlation, showing of course of unknown objects.
