The text I can see in this image is:

TOWN OF WILTON

At the top of the image, there are letters from E to M.

The image appears to be a map or road layout of the Wilton area, showing various roads, streets, and geographical boundaries in a black and white line drawing style.


- page 2 -

The image appears to be a map of an area, likely Norwalk, Connecticut. The map shows a network of roads and streets intersecting at various points. The map is black and white and seems to be a technical or survey-style map with numbered grid lines along the top and left side. The word "WILTON" is visible vertically on the left side of the map. The map has a complex layout of interconnected roads forming various shapes and sections.


- page 3 -

The document appears to be a map with a list of locations on the left side. The map shows the "Town of New Canaan" and "Town of Darien" with various roads and boundaries. The left column contains a long list of street names and what seem to be corresponding numbers, though the specific meaning of these numbers is not clear from the image. The map is in black and white and appears to be a vintage document from the 1950s.

The text on the left side includes street names such as:
BLACKSMITH LANE
SILVER ST
MILL RD
ROCK RIMMON RD
BOSTON PL
BRIDGE ST
BROOK ST
and many more, with associated numbers next to each street name.

The map shows various road intersections and town boundaries, with "Town of New Canaan" and "Town of Darien" clearly labeled.


- page 4 -

The image appears to be a detailed street map of an area, likely Norwalk, Connecticut. The map shows a complex network of streets, roads, and what seems to be a waterway or river running through the area. The map is in black and white, with thin lines representing streets and blocks. The word "CANAL" is visible in the top right corner of the map. The map is densely packed with street details, showing the intricate layout of the urban or suburban area.

[The image contains a map of Norwalk, Connecticut with a detailed street grid, topographical lines, and a long list of street names on the left side of the page. There's also a small inset map of Bell Island in the bottom left corner of the main map. The map shows the city's layout and extends to Long Island Sound on the right side.]

The text I can see in this image is:

LONG ISLAND

At the bottom of the map, there is a scale labeled:

Islands visible on the map:
- Chimmons Island
- Ram Island

The map appears to be a topographical map showing various paths of a ship or object with different speed characteristics, located near a sound area.


- page 9 -

The document appears to be a reference page or index titled "ISLAND" at the top, with columns labeled from F to R horizontally and what seems to be a list of entries or references vertically. The text is in a typewriter-style font and appears to be a dense table or index with multiple columns of text. Due to the small font size and density of the text, individual entries are difficult to read clearly. The page is black and white and looks like a scanned historical document.


- page 10 -

The document appears to be a tabular reference page with columns labeled A through H, and "LONG" written at the top right. The page is numbered "15" in the top right corner. There is a small map or diagram in the top left corner of the page. The majority of the page consists of rows of text entries, which appear to be lists of names, locations, or codes, with various columns of additional information. Due to the density and small size of the text, many individual entries are difficult to read clearly. The document looks like it could be from a military or administrative record, possibly a reference or index page.

Here is the text I can extract from the document:

[Left column contains a long list of what appears to be location names and numbers, but the text is too small and blurry to reliably transcribe without potential errors]

On the right side of the document:

TOWN OF NEW CANAAN

The document contains a map with radial lines emanating from a central point, with grid sections labeled A, B, C, D, E. The map shows road intersections and appears to be a location map for the town of New Canaan.
