VHF OMNI-DIRECTIONAL RADIO RANGE DESCRIPTION
The VHF omni-directional range provides visual track guidance along any selected radial from the station out to a distance of approximately 50 miles when flying at the minimum instrument altitude. These ranges operate in the frequencies between 112 and 118 megacycles and feature a special omni range type receiver to make use of the navigational features. Also provides simultaneous voice communication and 3-letter (coded) identification. In operation, the pilot selects a course by setting the pointer on a course or radial selector to the desired magnetic bearing and then flies that course by reference to a cross pointer instrument.

SECTIONAL CHARTS

The sectional aeronautical chart series provides complete coverage of the United States. An additional chart covers the Hawaiian Islands. These charts are designed primarily for piloting, which is like known as contact flying. They contain a maximum amount of cultural topographic features including important landmarks.

Sectional charts are revised at six-month periods to insure that the airman has the latest information available, and are sold through authorized agents located at airports and principal cities throughout the United States. They may also be obtained by writing to the Director, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce Building, Washington 25, D.C.

In the lower right-hand corner is printed the date of the chart. Below this the next scheduled printing is indicated. If the date of the chart is more than six months old, users are advised to check with the notices (Dates of Latest Prints) on file with authorized agents. Charts that carry older dates may be obsolete.

SEARCH AND RESCUE:
Search and Rescue Service is a life saving service provided through the combined efforts of the CAA, Air Force, and Coast Guard who are assisted by other organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Sheriff Air Patrol, State Police, and such other agencies as may be available. It provides search, survival aid, and rescue of personnel of missing aircraft.

All you need to remember to obtain this valuable protection is:
1. File a Flight Plan with a CAA Airway Communications Station in person or by telephone or radio.
2. File an Arrival Report.
3. If you land at a location other than intended destination, report the landing to the nearest CAA Communications Station.
4. If you land enroute and are delayed more than an hour, report this information to the nearest communications station.
5. Remember that if you fail to report within one hour after your E.T.A., a search will be started to locate you. If you fail to report within three hours after your E.T.A., the full facilities of the Search and Rescue Service will be activated.

Searchers are expensive, they inconvenience other people, and on numerous occasions the lives of other pilots are sacrificed when searching for lost or overdue pilots. SO, FILE AN ARRIVAL REPORT!

NAUTICAL MILES

The CAA is adopting, for all air-ground communication within the continental United States and Alaska, the nautical mile as the unit of horizontal distance, and the knot as the unit of horizontal speed.

The United States nautical mile is defined as equal to one-sixtieth (one minute) of a great circle on a sphere whose surface is equal to the surface of the earth. The value of a nautical mile is calculated on this basis as 1853.25 meters or 6080.20 feet. Since the common or statute mile is equal to 5280 feet, one nautical mile equals approximately 1.152 statute miles, and one statute mile equals approximately 0.868 nautical mile. For quick calculation the nautical mile may be considered approximately 1.15 statute miles, and the nautical mile may be shortened when the nautical mile.

In the lower margins of the sectional charts is provided a convenient conversion scale by which values in statute miles may be readily converted to nautical miles and vice versa. Distances expressed in either unit will may be scaled directly on the charts.

The length of one minute of latitude measured along a meridian on the surface of the earth at latitude 48Â°15' is equal to a United States nautical mile. North or south of 48Â°15' the length of a minute is slightly longer or shorter, since the earth is not a perfect sphere. However, for practical purposes, the nautical mile is considered equivalent to a minute of latitude at any point on the earth's surface. Therefore, the one-minute nautical mile of the meridian like one of the charts may also be used for scaling distances.

The knot is a unit of speed. One knot is equal to one nautical mile per hour; so, when an aircraft is travelling 200 nautical miles per hour, its speed is 200 knots.

CONVERSION TABLES

[Two tables showing conversions between Statute Miles and Nautical Miles are included, with columns for Statute Miles, Nautical Miles, and Feet]

Here is the text from the document:

AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONES (ADIZ)

In the United States several areas have been designated as Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ) by the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics in the interest of national security. All aircraft entering the Air Defense Identification Zones are required to file flight plans, except aircraft entering from within the Continental Limits of the United States or operating within the United States. These zones are: Boston ADIZ, New York ADIZ, Philadelphia ADIZ, Washington ADIZ, Los Angeles ADIZ, Minneapolis ADIZ, Knoxville ADIZ, Great Falls, Minnesota, Traverse City, and Bangor ADIZ.

The zones are bounded in the case of New York at 40Â° north latitude and 10 miles or more in place of 10,000 feet. The Air Defense Identification Zones are identified as follows: Boston ADIZ, New York ADIZ, Philadelphia ADIZ, Washington ADIZ, Los Angeles ADIZ, Minneapolis ADIZ, Traverse City ADIZ, Bangor ADIZ, Medford Boundary ADIZ, and Canadian Boundary ADIZ.

Canadian Air Defense Identification Zones (CADIZ) have been designated by the Director of Air Services, Department of Transport. All aircraft entering these zones at altitudes of 4000 feet or more above the immediate terrain are required to file flight plans. The Canadian Air Defense Identification Zones are identified as the Eastern CADIZ and the Western CADIZ.

They are also indicated on the face of aeronautical charts and are so labeled.

V.H.F. OMNI-RANGE (VOR)

The V.H.F. omni-range operates within the 112-118 megacycle band. In this band it is relatively free from atmospheric and electrical static and interference from other radio stations. Furthermore, it is not limited to four courses as is the A-N range, but provides definite guidance on any course, to or from the station, the pilot may select. That is why it is called the Omni (Directional) Range. At minimum transmission altitudes the VOR gives reliable indications up to about 50 miles, depending on enroute terrain.

In flying the V.H.F. omni-range, the pilot uses three basic instruments. The first is the Flight Path Deviation Indicator (cross-pointer instrument), the same type used for the visual-aural range (VAR) and the ILS localizer. The vertical needle of this instrument tells the pilot whether he is right or left of the desired course. The second is an Omni-Bearing Selector, manually operated by the course selector knob. When the course-pointer needle is centered, the omni-bearing selector indicates the magnetic bearing of the aircraft either to or from the station. The third is a "TO-FROM" indicator which shows whether the bearing indicated by the Omni-bearing Selector is from or to the station. Furthermore, the "TO-PROM" needle can tell a filer when his aircraft is too far from the VOR or is otherwise receiving a weak signal.

In this case, the pilot selects a course by adjusting the omni-bearing selector to the desired magnetic bearing, and then maintains it by keeping the cross-pointer needle centered. If the aircraft is correctly aligned with the "TO-FROM" indications, when the needle swings to the right, for example, it indicates that the course selected lies to the right.

For example, an aircraft is south of a VOR station. If its pilot desires to fly to the station, he sets the omni-bearing selector to "TO-FROM" Indicator will point to the word "FROM". If a turn of 180Â° is made north of the station, although the vertical cross-pointer will remain centered, the "TO-FROM" indicator will still point to "FROM". The pilot, however, will now find that he must fly "Away from the needle" to stay on course. This shows him that the "TO-FROM" indicator is incorrect. So, the pilot now rotates his omni-bearing selector to 180Â°. After he has done this, the "TO-FROM" indicator shifts to the "TO" position, and flying "Toward the needle" will keep him on course.

TABLE OF V.H.F. RECEPTION DISTANCES

With the increasing use of VHF and UHF frequencies for communication and navigation it appears desirable to publicize the reception distances for these frequencies. They, therefore, are tabulated below:

[Table showing Feet Above Ground and Reception Distance in Statute Miles for various heights from 500 to 20,000 feet]

If you are using a VHF transmitter, remember that its effective range increases with your altitude. Don't attempt to contact a station unless you are within "line of sight".

U.S. WEATHER BROADCASTS AND TRANSMISSIONS

All continuously operated CAA radio range and radio beacon stations having voice facilities on the range or radio beacon frequencies broadcast continuously. The 15-minute past-the-hour broadcast consists of weather reports from important weather terminals located on airway (s) within approximately 400 miles of the station. The 45-minutes-past-the-hour broadcast is an "area" broadcast consisting of weather reports from locations within the flight information area of the station.

The broadcast consists of the local weather reports and the latest available surface reports from other locations. Reports more than one hour old are not broadcast. Local winds aloft are broadcast 4 times after the broadcast at 8:15 and 12:15 A.M., and P.M., E.S.T. The velocities of winds aloft are broadcast in knots - not miles.

At selected stations the Weather Bureau provides a local terminal forecast covering the next two hours. This forecast is broadcast when available, immediately following the local weather report.

This image appears to be a detailed map, likely of a region in the northeastern United States. The map is black and white and shows numerous towns, roads, and geographical features. Some legible text includes "MASS" (Massachusetts) and various town names, though many are difficult to read due to the image quality. The map is crisscrossed with road lines and appears to cover a large area with multiple states or regions. There are grid lines and coordinate markings on the edges of the map. The image is somewhat dark and has a grainy, vintage appearance typical of mid-20th century documents.

This image appears to be a detailed road map or aeronautical chart, likely of the northeastern United States, specifically the Massachusetts and Rhode Island area. The map is densely packed with road networks, city and town names, and various markings. Some legible text includes:

- MASS (Massachusetts)
- CAUTION AREA
- DN (possibly a directional or navigation marker)
- Various town and city names are visible, though many are difficult to read due to the image's density and contrast

The map is black and white and appears to be from the 1950s, with numerous intersecting lines representing roads, highways, and possibly flight paths. The image is quite complex and would require careful examination to discern all details.

Headquarters 5010 informs that two F-97 aircraft of 26 AMS members 5-1264, aircraft commander Capt Donald R. Boddington and Capt Aubrey L. Hankins, were in the vicinity of Portland, Maine, at or about the time that a US Navy PBY aircraft reported sighting of two unidentified flying objects. US Navy aircraft maintained visual contact with objects from 14/9585 to 14/9585 Rp. 50. Electronic contact with objects was intermittent from 14/9585 to 14/9585 Rp. 50. Objects were on course heading of approximately 070 to westward. US Navy PBY followed objects from 14/9585, meanwhile the flying objects by pilot and copilot indicated a possibility that they observed a refueling operation.

Regarding AFOIB-ATIAC message concerning flyobjps of 160852 to 170052 Sep 52 at Portland, Maine, and passing DACO 57700. Additional information from crew of U.S. Navy PBY which made sighting indicates visual contact with objects was constant from 162052 to 170052. Objects were on course heading of approximately 220Â° for over 70 nautical miles. Viewed several colored objects from 45,000 - 67,000 ft origin. Description of the flying objects by pilot and copilot of PBY surveillance indicates strong possibility that they observed a refueling operation however, this was in year 9000 sync and course of the two KC-97's over Portland are as indicated with hand 1947's report. Request you verify the time the two KC-97's entered over Portland, Maine, when and there they conducted refueling operation, and course headings and approximate time as they left the Portland, Maine area.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SHEET

The following are the questions and answers directed by your office through Major Ready.

1. (Q) Clarification of time and duration of visual sighting.
   (A) Lts. Boak and Prentiss state that the time of initial visual sighting was at 2345 zebra and that visual contact was maintained until 0005 zebra.

2. (Q) Clarification of time of electronic contact and duration of electronic contact.
   (A) Initial radar contact (APS 31) was at 2352 zebra. Electronic contact was intermittent with none when the object was dead ahead. Contact could be maintained only when the relative bearing of the objects were 15 to 30 degrees. Radar contact was last completed at 2400 zebra. The ranges varied from three to five miles.

3. (Q) Show track of Naval F2Y and track of flying object on a sectional chart or sectional overlay.
   (A) See enclosure two.

4. (Q) What was the range and speed of unidentified object as determined from radar scope of F2V?
   (A) The range varied from three to five miles during the intermittent period that the target appeared on the radar scope. The speed of the object could not be determined electronically.

5. (Q) What was the appearance of target on radar scope?
   (A) See enclosure number three.

6. (Q) What was the location of known a/c in the area?
   (A) There were none in the area of sighting as far as is known.

7. (Q) This question concerned radar reports of a/c, etc. in the area at the time.
   (A) The radar located at Brunswick was on preventative maintenance during the time of this occurrence. None of the adjacent sites had any radar information pertinent to the incident. The pilots did not report while vectoring until the following morning or the radar could have been placed back into operation at the time.

Question and Answer Sheet (Cont'd)

8. (a) What was the altitude of the P2V as compared to altitude of the unidentified objects?

(A) The altitude of the P2V was 4000 feet plus or minus 400 feet. The altitude of the P2V was varied within these limits in the attempt to see the objects better against the remaining light of the sun. As far as could be determined the unidentified objects were at 4000 feet and did not deviate from that altitude.

9. (a) What was the cloud cover in the area at the time of the sighting?

(A) According to the pilot and co-pilot of the P2V it was a clear nite with no moon and with a few clouds on the horizon. This is borne out by weather report and the undersigned personal observation.
