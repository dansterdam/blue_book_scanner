VHF OMNI-DIRECTIONAL RADIO RANGE DESCRIPTION
The VHF omni-directional range provides visual track guidance along any
selected radial from the station out to a  distance of  of approximately 50. miles
when flying at the minimum instrument altitude. These ranges operate in 
the frequencies between 112  and 118 megacycles and require a special omni
range type recelver to make use of the navigational features. Also provided
are simultaneous voice communication and 3-letter (coded) identification. In
operation, the pilot selects a course by setting the pointer on a course or radial
selector to the desired magnetic bearing and then flies that course by refer-
ence to a cross pointer instrument.

### Description of Photographs
There is one photograph in the document. The photograph is an image of the United States sectional aeronautical chart, providing a visual representation of various sectional charts across the continental United States.

### OCR of Document Text

**SECTIONAL CHARTS**
The sectional aeronautical chart series provides complete coverage of the United States. An additional chart covers the Hawaiian Islands. These charts are designed primarily for plotting, which is also known as contact flying. They contain a maximum amount of cultural topographic features including important landmarks.

Sectional charts are revised at six-month periods to insure that the airman has the latest information available, and are sold through authorized agents located at airports and principal cities throughout the United States. They may also be obtained by writing to the Director, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce Building, Washington 26, D. C.

In the lower right-hand corner is printed the date of the chart. Below this the next scheduled printing is indicated. If the date of the chart is more than six months old, users are advised to check with the notices (Dates of Latest Prints) on file with authorized agents. Charts that carry older dates than those shown in large type on this list of dates are obsolete.

The document contains several photographs illustrating various visual emergency signals. Herein is the extracted text from the document:

```
SEARCH AND RESCUE:
Search and Rescue Service Is a life saving service provided through the combined efforts of the CAA, Air Force, and Coast Guard who are assisted by other organisations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Sheriffs Air Patrol, State Police, and such other agencies as may be available. It provides Search, survival aid, and rescue of personnel of missing or crashed aircraft.

All you need to remember to obtain this valuable protection Is:
1. Me a Flight Plan with s CAA Airways Communications Station In person or by telephone or radio.
2. File an Arrival Report.
         t If you land at a location other than intended destination, report the landing to the nearest CAA Communications Stalton,
4. If you land enroute and are delayed more than an hour, report this Information to the nearest communications station.
5. Remember that if you fall to report within one hour after your E.T.A., a search will be started to locate you. If you tall to report wtthin three hours after your E.T.A., the full facilities of the Search and Rescue Service will be activated.

Searches are expensive, they inconvenience other people, and on numerous occasions the lives of other pilots are sacrificed when searching for lost or overdue pilots. SO, FILE AN ARRIVAL REPORT!

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Lay out symbols by using strips of fabric or parachutes, pieces of wood, stones, or any available material.
2. Provide as much color contrast as possible between material used for symbols and background against which symbols are exposed.
3. Symbols should be at leant 10 feet high or larger, If possible Cara should be taken to tay out symbols exactly so shown to avoid confusion with other symbols.
4. In addition to using symbols, ivory effort Is to be made to attract attention by means of radio, flares, smoke, or other available means.
5. When ground Is covered with wow, signs can be made by dragging, shoveling or tramping the snow, The de-pressed mines forming the symbols will appear to be black from the air.
6. Pilot should acknowledge message by rocking wings from aide to side.

NAUTICAL MILES

The CAA is adopting, for all air-ground communication within the continental United States and Alaska, the nautical mile as the unit of horizontal distance, and the knot as the unit of horizontal speed. 

The United States nautical mile is defined as equal to one-sixtieth of a degree (one minute) of a great circle on a sphere whose surface is equal to the surface of the earth. The value of a nautical mile is calculated on this basis as 1853.25 meters or 6080.20 feet. Since the common or statute mile is equal to 5280 feet, one nautical mile equals approximately 1.152 statute miles, and one statute mile equals approximately 0.868 nautical mile. For quick calculation the nautical mile may be considered approximately one-seventh longer than the statute mile, and the statute mile approximately one-eighth shorter than the nautical mile. 

In the lower margins of the sectional charts is provided a convenient conversion scale by which values in statute miles may be readily converted to nautical miles and vice versa. Distances expressed in either unit may thus be scaled directly on the charts. 

The length of one minute of latitude measured along a meridian on the surface of the earth at latitude 48°15' is equal to a United States nautical mile. North or south of 48°15' the length of a minute is slightly longer or shorter, since the earth is not a perfect sphere. However, for practical purposes, the nautical mile is considered equivalent to a minute of latitude at any point on the earth's surface. Therefor, the one-minute subdivisions of the meridian lines on the face of charts may also be used for scaling distances. 

The knot is a unit of speed only. One knot is equal to one nautical mile per hour; as, when an aircraft is travelling 200 nautical miles per hour, its speed is 200 knots.

AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONES (ADIZ)

In the United States several areas have been designated as Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ) by the Adminis- 
trator of Civil Aeronautics in the interest of national security. All aircraft entering the Air Defense Identification Zones are
required to file flight plans, except aircraft entering from within the Continental Limits of the United States or operating within
the Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Knoxville, Great Falls, Minneapolis, Traverse City, and Bangor Zones, at
altitudes of less than 4000 feet above the immediate terrain. Any person who knowingly or willfully fails to do so is subject to
penalties of one year in prison or $10,000 fine. The Air Defense Identification Zones are identified as follows: Seattle ADIZ,
San Francisco ADIZ, Los Angeles ADIZ, Atlantic ADIZ, Pacific ADIZ, Albuquerque ADIZ, Knoxville ADIZ, Great Falls
ADIZ, Minneapolis ADIZ, Traverse City ADIZ, Bangor ADIZ, Mexican Boundary ADIZ, and Canadian Boundary ADIZ.
These areas are indicated on the face of Aeronautical Charts and are so labeled. For additional information see Civil Air Regu-
lations Part 620.

Canadian Air Defense Identification Zones (CADIZ) have been designated by the Director of Air Services, Department
of Transport. All aircraft entering these zones at altitudes of 4000 feet or more above the immediate terrain are required to
file flight plans. The Canadian Air Defense Identification Zones are identified as the Eastern CADIZ and the Western CADIZ.
They are also indicated on the face of aeronautical charts and are so labeled.

V.H.F. OMNI-RANGE (VOR)

The V.H.F. omni-range operates within the 112-118 megacycle band. In this band it is relatively free from atmospheric and precipitation static and interference from other radio stations. Furthermore, it is not limited to four courses as the A-N range, but provides definite guidance on any course, to or from the station, the pilot may select. That is why it is called the Omni (Directional) Range. As maintaining instrument altitude the VOR gives reliable indications up to about 150 mi., depend¬ing on your distance.

In flying the V.H.F. omni-range, the pilot uses three basic instruments. The first is the Flight Path Deviation Indicator (cross-pointer instrument), the same type used for the Vasi-aural range (VAR) and the T.S Localiser. The vertical needle of this in¬strument tells the pilot whether he is right or left of the desired course. The second is an Omni-bearing Selector. manually oper¬ated by the rotation of a small knob, by which the pilot selects the course he desires to fly. When the cross-pointer needle is centered, the omni-bearing selector indicates the magnetic bearing of the aircraft either to or from the station. The third is a "TO-FROM" indicator which shows whether the bearing indicated by the Omni-bearing Selector is from ar to the station. Furthermore, the "TO-FROM" needle can tell _i flier when his aircraft is too far from the VOR or is otherwise receiving a weak signal. In this case the needle points to a red sector instead of TO or FROM. In operation, the pilot selects a course by adjusting the omni-bearing selector to the desired magnetic bearing, and then main¬tains it by keeping the cross-pointer needle centered. If the aircraft is correctly aligned with the TO-FROM indications, when the needle swings to the right, for example, it indicates that the course selected lies to the right.

For example, an aircraft is due south of a VOR station. If its pilot desires to fly to the station, he sets the omni-bearing selector to indicate 0°. the "TO-FROM" indicator will then point to the word "10". As the aircraft passes over the station the "TO-FROM" indicator will point to the word "FROM". If a turn of 180 ° is made north of the station, although the vertical cross-pointer needle will again become centered, the "TO-FROM" indicator will still point to "FROM". The pilot, however, will now find that he must fly "Away from the needle" to stay on course. This shows him that the TO-FROM indicator is incorrect. So, the pilot now rotates his omni-bearing selector to 180°. After he has done this, the "TO-FROM" indicator shifts to the "TO" position, and flying "Toward the needle" will keep him on course.

TABLE OF V.H.F. RECEPTION DISTANCES

With the increasing use of VHF and UHF frequencies for communication and navigation it appears desirable to publicize the reception distances for these frequencies. They, therefore, are tabulated below:

Feet Above Ground    Reception Distance**
    Station             Statute Miles
      500                   30
    1,000                  45
    3,000                  80
    5,000                100
  10,000                140
  15,000                175
  20,000                200

•No physical obstruction intervening.
**Based on zero elevation of the facility.

If you are using a VHF transmitter, remember that its effective range increases with your altitude. Don't attempt to contact a station unless you are within "line of sight"

U.S WEATHER BROADCASTS AND TRANSMISSIONS

All continuously operated CAA radio range and radio beacon stations having voice facilities on the range or radio beacon fre¬quencies broadcast weather reports and airway information at 15 and 45 minutes past each hour. The 15-minute past-the- hour broadcast is an "airway" broadcast consisting of weather reports from important terminals located on airways (s) within approximately 400 miles of the station. The 45-minute-past-the-hour broadcast is an “area" broadcast consisting of weather reports from locations within the flight information area of the station.

The broadcast consists of the local weather report and the latest available surface reports from other locations. Reports more than one hour old are not broadcast. Local winds aloft are broadcast 4 times alter the broadcasts at 6:15 and 15:15 A.M., and P.M., E.S.T. The velocities of winds aloft are broadcast in knots - not miles.
At selected stations the Weather Bureau provides a local terminal forecast covering the next two hours. This forecast is broad¬cast, when available, immediately following the local weather report.

Pilots should use the broadcast to avoid, if possible, calling airway communications stations off or about 15 and 45 minutes past the hour which are scheduled broadcast times to request weather information, as such calls may delay starting of Scheduled broadcasts and cause Inconvenience to other persons who are dependent on the broadcasts for weather reports.

Additional information from crew of U.S. Navy PB/ which made sighting indicates visual contact with objects was constant from 1629/Z to 17001Z. Objects were on course heading of approximately 220° for over 70 nautical mile. Sword aircraft followed objects from 1615/Z - 0701/Z to 16301 - 0716/Z. Descriptions of the flying objects by pilot and co-pilot of PB7 nevertheless
indicates strong possibility that they observed a refuelling operation, however, time-
background in your message DOOU 47802 and course of the two KC-97’s over Portland Area

QUESTION AND ANSWER SHEET

The following are the questions and answers directed by your office
through Major Rudy.

1. (Q) Clarification of time and duration of visual sighting.

(A) Lts. Boak and Prentiss state that the time of initial visual sighting was at 2345 zebra and that visual contact was maintained until 0005 zebra.

2. (Q) Clarification of time of electronic contact and duration of electronic contact.

(A) Initial radar contact (APS 31) was at 2352 zebra. Electronic contact was intermittant with none when the object was dead ahead. Contact could be maintained only when the relative bearing of the objects were 15 to 30 degrees. Radar contact was last completed at 2400 zebra. The range varied from three to five miles.

3. (Q) Show track of Naval P2V and track of flying object on a sectional chart or sectional overlay.

(A) See enclosure two.

4. (Q) What was the range and speed of unidentified object as determined from radar scope of P2V?

(A) The range varied from three to five miles during the intermittent periods that the target appeared on the radar scope. The speed of the objects could not be determined electronically.

5. (Q) What was the appearance of target on radar scope? 

(A) See enclosure number three.

6. (Q) What was the location of known a/c in the area?

(A) There were none in the area of sighting as far as is known.

7. (Q) This question concerned radar reports of a/c, etc. in the areas at the time.

 (A) The radar located at Brunswick was on preventative maintenance during the time of this occurrence. None of the adjacent sites had any radar information pertinent to the incident. The pilots did not report their sighting until the following morning or the radar located at Brunswick could have been placed back into operation at the time.

Question and Answer Sheet. (Confd)

8. (Q) What was the altitude of the P2V as compared to the
      altitude of the unidentified objects?

     (A) The altitude of the P2V was 4000 feet plus or minus
400 feet. The altitude of the P2V was varied within these
limits in the attempt to see the objects better against
the remaining light of the sun. As far as could be de-
termined the unidentified objects were at 4000 feet and
did not deviate from that altitude.

9. (Q) What was the cloud cover in the area at the time of the
     sighting?

    (A) According to the pilot and co-pilot of the P2V it was a
clear nite with no moon and with a few clouds on the hori-
zon. This is borne out by weather report and the under-
signed personal observation.
