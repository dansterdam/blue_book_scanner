"Flying cigar over Haifa Sunday. Four men returning from work in the Haifa Bay area to town saw a "flying cigar" emerge from the clouds over a quarry 1.5 kilometers on the Haifa-Nazareth Road at 4:12 P.M., one of them told the Post today.

The object was fairly low, was cigar shaped, and moved at great speed. Three bright lights, at either end and in the center, made the object clearly visible he said.

The cigar disappeared in 80 to 90 seconds after it changed direction over NeveSha'aman.

Two flying saucers were seen over Mt. Carmel last Tuesday by several persons.
