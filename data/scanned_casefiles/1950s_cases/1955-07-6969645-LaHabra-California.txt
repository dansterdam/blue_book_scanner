The text on this page is mostly illegible due to poor image quality. However, I can make out a few elements:

At the bottom of the page:
RA129
M WF126 YDD63 XYA233 XDB144 XXE142JRA671JBE8 10

The number "12" is written in the bottom right corner.

There is a handwritten note near the bottom left, but it is not clearly legible.

The rest of the text on the page appears to be too faint or blurry to accurately transcribe.
