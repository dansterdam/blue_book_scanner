32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" at the same point to show how high the object was at the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The document contains two hand-drawn sketches with curved lines and markings, but as instructed, I will not describe the details of the sketches beyond the text instructions.

At the bottom of the page, there are some additional markings and stamps, including "A.P." and what appears to be a file or reference number, but the text is partially illegible.

DATE November 1, 1954

At approximately 06:15, 19 Nov 1954, I was on duty as an En Route at Near #112, Johnson A.B. All 900. I was talking to ATC over Small inside of the Air title Site house when I stepped to the plane and the door - there were a strange two looking phenomenon in the sky which anyone would notice. I called Sgt. Smith's attention to it. Believing it was the moon, on a strange position, 110 south level it was a cloud, and we were still upset outside and I saw the moon approaching alone in a little in the way we were facing east at the time. I and Sgt. Smith both saw the object out in the sky one to the real shiny. It might be the object east of it would be would go well slightly against the side facing us. There very close, against a well placed object and because it was to close the object up with a telescope gate and it was not of far approximately two minutes. I'll pass this time, the object moved a bit and continuously ground speed.

The only legible text I can see on this page is the word "BUILDING" at the top of the document. The rest of the page appears to be very faint or obscured, with only a few faint lines and markings visible. The image looks like an old, somewhat degraded document or report page.

This image appears to be a map or aerial view of a section of land, likely a military base or urban area. The top portion of the image shows a detailed layout of buildings, streets, and blocks. There are visible numbers along the edges of the map, such as 315, 320, 325, and 330. The map is in black and white and shows a grid-like pattern of structures. The bottom portion of the image is mostly blank or faded, with some dark edges and a lighter central area.
