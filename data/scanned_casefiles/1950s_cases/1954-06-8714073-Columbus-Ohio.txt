I then started to Col. O'Mara's office to report the whole incident to him. Before I could leave the office however, I received another phone call from AMC PIO. A Mister ??? asked me if I had calls from the press on the UFB. I told him of the conversation just prior with Mr. Fisher and that I was on my way to report it to Col. O'Mara. Mr. ??? stated he would try to hold off the press until he heard from me.

4. I then proceeded to Col. O'Mara's office and reported word-for-word all that I have reported hereon. Colonel O'Mara immediately contacted AMC PIO, and it was decided that no official AF statement of any kind would be printed. AMC PIO also stated they would inform the press to contact Washington (Hq USAF) for a statement in about one (1) week. Col O'Mara then directed the undersigned airman to send a message immediately to D/I, USAF including all available details on the case. Attachment #2.

5. After the message was drafted and submitted for transmission the undersigned airman commenced a journal investigation to obtain all possible details of the sighting. I telephoned Lt. Roe, the source, at his place of occupation, NCR, Dayton, and asked him if I could talk with him regarding the UFOB report. He agreed, and I met with the source in Bldg. #77, of NCR at approx 1400 hours 24 June 1954.

6. The source was very cooperative and seemed discouraged at his inability to identify the object. The source, upon my request, accomplished one (1) copy of the "U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet." Attachment #1. While source was completing the form, I talked with him and obtained the following statements:


- page 2 -

Here is the text from the document:

"I thought it was a 'blow-job' (jet) at first."

"It had a continuous brightness, no flickering or pulsating."

"I chased it out of sight'."

"I made several complete circles, but it seemed to make them, in position, right with me."

"It seemed to me whatever it was, watched my lights, for when I started to change my position, he would go right with me."

"When I contacted Patterson tower, I told them of the situation and asked them to watch as I flew over. They said they only saw me. I also asked for my radar position. They told me they had me on a NE heading and I was on a SE heading. I corrected them but received no reply."

"There was definite linear movement of the object in relation to my aircraft."

"It left me, I didn't leave it."

"I contacted a C-47, aircraft S/N 263, I think, that was alerted by Patterson to be on the lookout for the thing. The pilot said he didn't see a thing."

"I knew there was a blow-job up from the 97th somewhere over Columbus."

"There were two other F-51 boys up over Columbus. Before the sighting, I had intended to join formation with them. I believe it was Lt. Wallace and Lt. Wilmer. When I saw it, I asked Wallace - 'Did you see that blow-job?' He said, 'No, I don't see it'."


- page 3 -

"I first saw the object at approximately 9,000 feet and when I reached Dayton I was at 9,000 feet."

"It chased me from Columbus to Dayton, I chased it back to Columbus. It left me there."

"I remember when it left me. I had climbed to about 12,000 or 12,500 feet."

7. Before I left the source, I explained to him the sensitive nature of this situation as far as the Air Force and the press were concerned. He stated that he was called earlier in the day by a reporter and had given him an account of the sighting.

8. The source stated he did not initiate release of the incident to the press and that he did not have any idea of whom informed them first. In fact, the source was quite angry upon learning of the initial leak to the press.

9. I completed my interrogation of the source at approximately 1535 hours and returned to ATIC.

II. REPORT OF INTERVIEWS

A. Tower Operator - Patterson AFB - 25 June 1954.

1. At 0800 hours, the undersigned airman visited the Patterson Tower and met with S/Sgt Shoemaker, who was on duty at the time of the incident. Sgt Shoemaker stated that Lt. Roe contacted the tower at 2120 hours and requested the tower personnel to search for the object he was chasing towards Columbus. Lt. Roe also stated that the object seemed to be approximately five (5) miles in front of his aircraft.

Sgt Shoemaker and another airman both grabbed binoculars and observed Lt. Roe's aircraft, but did not see any light. Sgt Shoemaker then asked the pilot of C-47 aircraft, serial number 265 (which had just taken off) to observe Lt. Roe's object. Pilot replied he could not see any light of that sort. When Lt. Roe last reported his position to the tower, he was 15 miles SE of Columbus. Just after Lt. Roe's report, an F-86D aircraft reported in as 15 miles NW of Columbus and requested landing instructions.

II. Report of Interview (continued)

B. Operations NCOIC - 97th FIS, Patterson AFB - 25 June 1954.

1. Immediately after leaving the Patterson tower, I went to the 97th FIS to check for any unusual reports that they might have received during the same period of the sighting. M/Sgt O'Cara, NCOIC of the Operations Section stated they had had two (2) aircraft in the air at that time. One, aircraft serial number 51-3018, piloted by Lt. Kirk, and aircraft serial number 51-8340, piloted by Captain Costa.

2. Take-off and landing times are as follows:
51-3018     T/O 2040 hours     Landed 2220 hours
51-8340     T/O 2145 hours     Landed 2305 hours

Sgt. O'Cara could not tell me which of the aircraft was in the Columbus area during the time of the sighting. Subject pilots could not be immediately located for questioning, but Sgt. O'Cara promised to ask them about the report and contact me at the earliest possible time.

II: Report of Interviews. (Continued)

C. Operations Officer - NG - Dayton Municipal Airport. - 25 June 1954.

1. At approximately 1000 hours, 25 June 1954, the undersigned airman, accompanied by Dr. Evans (ATIC Astro-Physicist consultant on UFOs) visited the 161st Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the Ohio National Guard based at the Dayton Municipal Airport. We were introduced to Captain Wagenhals, Operations Officer of that unit. (Note: Captain Wagenhals was the first and only Air Force official to notify the Aerial Phenomena Section of the UFO.) Captain Wagenhals was first to reach Lt Roe when he landed. He stated Lt Roe said, "I must be going off my rocker because I saw something really moving up there." Lt Roe proceeded to tell Captain Wagenhals the story of the sighting. The interview with the Captain practically verified everything the source told the undersigned airman. Captain Wagenhals stated Lt Roe would have to be awfully close to a jet aircraft to see its exhaust unless the jet was using its afterburner. The jet theory was ruled out however by all three (3) persons at the interview when speed was taken into consideration. No jet could fly that slow (referring to Lt. Roe's stalling at approximately 100 - 100 MPH and the object not passing him) without apparent aerodynamic complications arising. Captain Wagenhals stated that the weather over the Dayton area was very clear and visibility unlimited.


- page 7 -

II. Report of Interview (Continued)

D. Air Instructor, CNG, Dayton Municipal Airport. - 25 June 1954.

1. Upon completion of our discussion with Captain Wagenhals, we were introduced to Lt. Colonel McClure (Reg AF Instructor). Colonel McClure had landed just before Lt. Roe. After landing, Lt. Roe went to Colonel McClure's office and related the story to him. During our discussion with Colonel McClure he verified what we had previously obtained from the source on the UFO.

2. Lt. Roe suggested to Colonel McClure that at first he thought it was a star. But when he changed positions a few times, it became apparent that it was not. (This statement was not revealed to the undersigned airman during his interview with the source.) Lt. Roe also stated he passed over the Dayton tower twice so that the tower personnel could observe the object, but obtained negative results.

3. Colonel McClure, who was returning from Pittsburg in a C-47, stated that visibility was good all the way from Pittsburg to Dayton. He also stated that a civilian Martin 202 had accompanied him from Pittsburg to Dayton. Just prior to landing, the Dayton tower asked Colonel McClure if he had noticed any UFO, to which the Colonel replied "no".

4. Colonel McClure expressed the opinion that the UFO could have been a "canopy" reflection which happens from time to time while flying an F-51 at night. However, the Colonel highly recommended Lt. Roe as a qualified observer and further stated, "He's an old combat pilot with a lot of experience and in my (the Colonel's) opinion is a very well-stable man, a very reliable individual."


- page 8 -

D. Air Instructor, HQ. Dayton Municipal Airport. - 25 June 1954. (Continued)

5. Dr. Byers later considered the canopy reflection phenomena as improbable due to the maneuverability of the UFO reported by Lt. Roe.

Dr. Byers and the undersigned airman returned to ATIC at approximately 1215 hours, 25 June 1954.

II. Report of Interviews. (Continued)

E. Report of Telephone Conversation With Mr. Mitchell of Patterson AFB Radar Approach Control Offices - 25 June 1954

1. At 1330 hours the undersigned airman called Mr. Mitchell of the RAC office to obtain information from the radar control operator who plotted Lt. Roe's position. Mr. Mitchell stated the operator was not on duty at the time, but would be glad to have him write a statement and sign it as to what exactly happened when Lt. Roe contacted him for a plot. It was agreed that upon completion of the statement, Mr. Mitchell would notify Sgt. Dreppard who will personally obtain the statement. This was decided in order to eliminate time-consuming channels.

2. Mr. Mitchell did say that the operator told him that he had had two (2) aircraft in scope. One approaching NW (towards Vandalia) and the other, assumed to be Lt. Roe's aircraft, heading after the object.

CONCLUSIONS:

1. This report contains as many details and facts as were available on 24 and 25 June 1954. Upon reviewing this report, there are several paragraphs yet to be included, therefore, it is felt that this report can be utilized as a future rough draft report to facilitate appropriate future entries, deletions, etc.

2. Dr. Byars, AFIAC-L, would also like to contribute to this report when it is finalized.

3. Tentative analysis of all available details obtained indicate the following:

The OOB was not -
a jet aircraft,
a canopy reflection,
or
a weather balloon.

TENTATIVE EVALUATION: A reflection phenomena of some sort. An attempt to further determine the source of the reported light will be conducted as soon as possible.

CASE SUMMARY NUMBER 4

On the evening of 24 June 1954 an ANG pilot, flying an F-51 between Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, reported being followed in close formation by a light for more than 30 minutes. He performed various maneuvers in an attempt to either lose the light or collide with it; however, it remained in relatively the same position to the aircraft.

The pilot informed other air traffic and the Dayton control tower of the phenomena and asked them to observe it as he flew by. Neither was able to see any light outside of the aircraft.

Project Blue Book evaluated this sighting as a canopy reflection.

The significance of this sighting was considerably heightened by the interest of the local press and a complete investigation was carried out.

REPORT OF TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH RADAR CONTROL OPERATOR

At approximately 1130 hrs, 1 July 1954, the undersigned airman contacted 3/Sgt. MAYNARD HARRIS, 1214-6 AACS Det., W-P AFB, relative to the UFO report by 1st Lt. Roe.

At approximately 2130 hrs, 23 June 1954, 3/SGT Harris was contacted by the personnel of the Dayton Municipal Airport Tower. They asked 3/SGT Harris if his radar was working. They then explained that Lt. Roe was now over their tower and had complained of an object which had followed him from Columbus to Dayton. Sgt. Harris was requested to pick up Roe and the object if possible on the scope. Roe's position as reported to Sgt. Harris by the Dayton tower was 150° (wing SE) outbound from the Dayton Tower to W-P.

Sgt. Harris stated that when picked Lt. Roe on his scope and quickly, with what information he had, calculated Lt. Roe's position to be on a NE heading. Sgt. Harris admits this was a wrong assumption and upon notification by Lt. Roe of the wrong heading, the Sgt. recalculated and plotted two (2) targets on his scope. One (1) he surmised to be Lt. Roe's F-51, the other, which was first following Lt. Roe and then passed him by seemed to be an object with a great amount of speed. (Sgt. Harris told the undersigned airman that it could have been a jet or "something else"). Sgt. Harris stated that there was quite a bit of air traffic in the area while he was plotting Lt. Roe's position. Also, the Sgt. stated that the pilot of C-47, serial number 263 complained of something following him, but when requested to make identification of the "something" he could see nothing. Sgt. Harris requested the pilot to keep his eyes open for anything unusual. The Sgt. also requested to F-80's (who were up in the Columbus area) to have a look-see, which proved negative.

Ohio's Air Officials Are Investigating "Flying Saucer" Story Related By Pilot

DAYTON, O., June 24—Dayton Force Base officials would give no information on the sighting other than to say a "verbal report" had been received. The public information officer at the base said a written report, on a form sheet, is to be filed in Washington as is the custom in such cases.

A spokesman in the area personnel, Technical Intelligence Center at the base verified that the report was received. He added that no further information could be given.

Roe said he "picked up the object" near Columbus shortly after 3 p.m. Wednesday. It followed him to the airport at Vandalia and took off when he gave chase back to near Columbus.

"It looked like a round white light. Although it was still twilight, I could never get the object in a position so I could get a silhouette. It kept maneuvering around so it was against the dark and part of the sky," Roe told the OANG and Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

Article from the Dayton "Journal Herald," 25 June 1954

Object "Chases" Plane Home ... Saucer Watchers Ready

An unidentified object "chased" an F-51 Mustang fighter from Columbus to the Vandalia airport just before "Look-for-Flying-Saucer Day" here.

The pilot, Harry L. Roe Jr., 3506 Harvard boulevard, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard, reported to officials in the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) tower at Vandalia he was "bringing the object back so you can see it."

George Barnes, CAA airport traffic controller, said this story was told by the pilot:

"There aren't any airfields in the southeastern direction that we know of," Barnes said. "I think a jet would run out of fuel unless it is flying at 30 or 40 thousand feet, and that makes me think it might not have been a jet."

The pilot seemed quite excited. He said the object's altitude was about 10,000 feet and it was going about 300 miles per hour.

"He dropped his landing gear at 10,000 feet," Roe said. "I saw him down as much as an F-51 can, and the object would rise again with him."

Barnes advanced the theory that the object might have been a jet with the position of the F-51 pilot.

The story will be inaugurated today, with the 45-minute chase and look a-being toward the southeast.

ANOTHER SAUCER?

Dayton Flyer Reports 45-Minute Chase Of 'Unidentified Object'

Dayton had another "flyer" report Thursday and Air Force officials are investigating the report. It stemmed from an Air National Guard, based at Cox Municipal Airport.

Harry L. Roe Jr. of 3306 Harvand blvd., an employee at the National Cash Register Co. and the pilot, termed what he saw an "unidentified object." He told the Dayton Daily News that he would not call it a "flying saucer," because of his diabetic condition.

Roe said he "picked up the object" near Columbus shortly after 5 p.m. Wednesday. It followed him to Vandalia and "took off" when he gave chase near a column bus.

"It looked like a round white light. Although it was still further I could never get the object in a position so I could get a silhouette. It kept maneuvering around so it was against the darkened part of the sky," Roe told the News.

OANG and Wright-Patterson Air Force base officials would give no information on the sighting other than to say a "verbal report" had been received. The public information office at the base said a written report, on a form sheet, is to be filed in Washington, as is the customary procedure.

A spokesman in the area phone from a section of the Air Technical Intelligence center at the base verified that the report was received. He added that no further information could be given.

ROE TOLD how he "tried to quickly and get the object in better position. He said it managed to stay a little above and behind him.

"I made left and right turns, but it stayed right with me. I couldn't get it past eight o'clock," Roe reported.

He was flying one of the Guard's F-51 Mustang fighters on a routine training flight.

The other person to see this object was a co-worker;
[name redacted], Columbus, Ohio.

We are not related. At work Monday June 28 th I mentioned that I had seen a strange aircraft during the week end and the number of lights on it. At this point Leroy spoke up saying that he had seen the same thing and that at approximately 3 A.M. while he was standing on his porch. I have indicated the location of his house on the map. He proceeded to describe the object much as I had seen it. In detail that it came from almost due west, and then as it passed overhead turned almost south east. He described the lights exactly as I have described them to you and that he heard no sound from the object. With this information I find that the object was a U.S. Air Force craft.

He also judged it's shape to be similar to a football and at of 200 ft. lens and to be moving at about 40 m. p. hr. at 1000 ft. altitude. He says that he saw nothing apparent from the cockpit and was too large to be an airplane and too small to be a blimp.

I have talked to the personnel of Lockbourne Air Base all present agreed that the U.S. Air Force must have a test craft of aircraft that was operating. If so or not this was the sighting of a very definite object.

[The rest of the page contains a hand-drawn map/diagram which appears to show the path/location of the observed object, but as instructed, I will not describe the details of this diagram.]

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may refer to information that you have already given in the questionnaires, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Redacted]
DATE: Oct. 27, 1954

To simplify this description I am including a map of the areas involved, to show the course of Columbus, showing the apparent flight path of the object.

When I first noticed the object, I was in the bathroom of my house, looking out the window, and it was about 7:15 PM. It came over town and I noticed the glow of the town's lights on the under side which seemed broad and of a sunmetal color. This direction I have determined to be 12 degrees west of north.

Having passed over the main part of town it lost the glow of these lights and then turned to the east. All the time it was approaching me there was a circle of lights, in a vertical plane, about the minor axis. (The object was the shape and proportions of a football.)

As it turned this circle of light disappeared and a row of lights appeared horizontally along the major axis. I counted 15-17 of these lights. They were yellowish in color like from incandescent bulbs.

As it turned nearly broadside to me I noticed that it's apparent length equalled the width of the house, under it, on the street next back of my house. I watched as it, in steady motion, moved to the east and just before passing from view seemed to turn again this time to the south. The entire flight path I have determined as 12 degrees from the horizontal as near as I can estimate.

During the entire time of observation I heard no sound back of my house. During the entire time I heard no sound from the object. The vertical distance seemed to be about 25 minutes.

(Based on my experience in photographic dark-room timing)

Judged object to be 300 ft. long (major axis) and apparent diameter to be 75 ft.

2. Capt. Hardin, Chief, Aerial Phenomena Section, was not present in the office when the above report was received by the undersigned airman.

Immediately upon return of Capt. Hardin, he was informed of the telephone conversation. It was decided by Capt. Hardin (after short analysis of the facts available) and the undersigned airman, that the report was a reflection phenomena of some type and we would investigate the matter more thoroughly on Monday, 28 June 1954. (Capt. Hardin then departed on two (2) days leave.)

3. At approximately 10:45 hours, the plot began to thicken. Sgt Drepperd received another telephone call from "Doc" Fisher of the Dayton Daily Newspaper.

Following is the exact conversation as I, (Sgt. Drepperd), remember it:

Mr. Fisher, "Heard you fellows received a UFO report - is it true."

Sgt. Drepperd, "Yes, I received a verbal report earlier this morning."

Mr. Fisher, "What did it look like?"

Sgt. Drepperd, "I am sorry, but I am not authorized to make any statements or press releases."

Mr. Fisher, "I see." "This fellow was in the OMG, wasn't he?"

Sgt. Drepperd, "I am awfully sorry, but I can't release any information. The only agency that releases official Air Force statements is USAF PIO. I suggest you contact Hq USAF for further information."

Mr. Fisher, "Washington, eh?" Will Washington know of this report?"

Sgt. Drepperd, "Sorry, can't tell you. Let me call you back after I check with my superiors."

Mr. Fisher, "O.K. I've still got 25 minutes to press time. Goodbye."

I. INVESTIGATOR'S NARRATIVE REPORT

25 June 1954

SUBJECT: Unidentified Object Report by 1st Lt. Harry Roe, Ohio Air
National Guard Pilot

1. At approximately 0915 hours, Thursday, 24 June 1954, the undersigned airman, NCOIC, Aerial Phenomena Section, received a telephone call from Capt. Wagenhals, Operations Office of the Ohio Air National Guard stationed at the Dayton Municipal Airport. Subject of the conversation was the report of an UFOB unserved by 1st Lt. Harry Lee Roe, Jr., Ohio Air National Guard Pilot as he was on a routine flight between Dayton and Columbus. Following are the details related during the conversation:

Time of Sighting - Between 2045 and 2145 hours, 23 June 1954
Object - Bright Light
Size - Unknown

(Note: Due to a very poor telephone connection, Sgt. Dreppard could not hear Capt. Wagenhals' report distinctly.)

Capt. Wagenhals stated, "the source had initial contact with the UFOB NW of Dayton at 2100 hours, 23 June 54." Source could not estimate distance of UFOB. Source told Capt. Wagenhals that, "he and object remained at approximately 7000' to 9000' altitude throughout observation." Source contacted Municipal Airport tower to alert personnel as he flew over.

Source further told Capt. Wagenhals that, "he attempted several 90 degree turns into object with negative results." UFOB remained "on" wing tip during source's maneuvers. Source stated "he returned to home site from a position approximately 40 miles SW of Columbus."

"Object first appeared at approximately 3 o'clock."

"It stayed down twilight (in the darker portion of the sky) all during my observation."

"I tried practically every maneuver I know of to get it into the twilight and obtain a silhouette, if possible. I tried changing my heading and altitude with negative results."

"At one time, I chopped the throttle, put gear and flaps down in hopes that it would pass by. I was down to 100 - 110 MPH, but the damn thing acted like there was a pilot out there. When I slowed down all of a sudden, he gave a little surge at first, came practically parallel with me, and then maintained the same speed as I did off of my right wing."

"I saw regular fighter turns into the object, but at all times it turned with me. However, when I resumed my headings toward Dayton, sometimes he would be on my left and sometimes he was on my right."

"During most of the turns, it remained at an 8 o'clock position."

"It seemed to be slightly above me at all times."

Estimated distance from observer - "It's very hard to tell but I guess he was anywhere from 1000 to 1800 feet from me."

"Both the size and intensity were very similar to an aircraft taillight".
