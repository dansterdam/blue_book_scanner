REMARKS
                Saucer Tales Fly
                                    By Reuters     Lyon, France
France's "flying saucer circus" continues to rouse interest
around the country as more eyewitnesses recount "saucers,"
"discs" and other whizzing celestial objects keep pouring in.
    A farmer said a creature came up to him on a lonely
road, caressed his arm and burbled unintelligible noises at him.
    This is west of Rouen in France, which the farmer could
not describe as hallucinating. A strange paralysis which
caused him to be temporarily paralyzed.
    A former artillery observer said he saw a dark-gray object
hovering over the mountains near Chambery at about 6,000
feet. He claimed he stopped his car and watched as other
motorists joined in looking at the mass which suddenly "shot
away like lightning" and disappeared.
    The reports recorded in the Lyon area but they were only of the old-fashioned "saucer" which have off
bright lights and then suddenly disappeared.
