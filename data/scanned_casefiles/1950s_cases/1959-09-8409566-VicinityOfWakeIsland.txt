COUNTRY OF ACTIVITY REPORTING:  PACIFIC
REPORT NO:  32-10-59
DATE OF INFORMATION:  17 Sep 59
UFO
SUMMARY:  (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative reports. Basic narrative text on AF Form 112)
This object was sighted at 1812Z, 3 passengers noted an unusual concussion at 5 o'clock.  The object appeared to be moving towards them.  The passengers estimated the size of the object to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, and described it as being disc-shaped.  The object first hovered, and then proceeded to ascend at a high rate of speed.  The object was rapidly dissipated by winds, and had disappeared entirely within 3-5 minutes.  The passengers were shaken, and though they could not recall the precise details, they knew they had seen something out of the ordinary.
Subsequent investigation revealed that the most some of an Atlas IRBM fired from Vandenberg AFB at 17:20Z on 9 Sep 59 appeared to the passengers to be a possibility that this same missile may have been responsible for their sighting.

Trail bearing remained constant at 100 degrees from the aircraft. Photographs were taken and sighting was observed until disappearance by winds and altitude obscured to its original heading.

11. Arthur H. Clarke, Jr. (3538824) 
Grade - 2nd Lt (USA??), Office of the Chief of Intelligence Branch, War Plans Division, HQ WESTAF, preliminary analysis of possible cause of sighting - There is a possibility that the trail or contrail observed was not generated by an external missile case. Supporting evidence would include the following factors:
a. The contrail seemed unusually broad as observed by the witness and covered a large area of the sky.
b. The undercarriage or fin of the object seemed to expand and increase in size under the proper conditions. 
c. The observer's impression was that the object was moving downward or descendent.
d. The photographs appear to show a normal vapor trail from a Jet but took place earlier on the same day.
The photographs do not indicate any similarity firing sequence or contrail characteristics that would associated with an external Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. from Vandenberg AFB, California, took place earlier on the same day.
12. Photographs are attached. Supplemental photographic information is as follows:
a. Type and make of camera: Rolina IIIC.
b. Lens: Type - standard; Focal length 2.8f 135mm - make - Schneider.
c. Date and time of exposure: 1300 hours, 8 September 1959.
d. Data and other information obtained from photographs.

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. On 9 September 1959, 18092 at approximately 1924N 163365, several crew members and passengers of a C-124 inbound to Kadena AFB, Okinawa from Wake Island sighted an unidentified light or luminous object. The object was about 5 minutes above a scattered cumulus cloud deck with tops at 5,000 feet. Observers of object described it as being white light, changing colors. Objects size was estimated at 75-100 feet in diameter. The object was observed for approximately 3-5 minutes by pilots C.D. Johnson, 2711242, passenger; SPS Hughes F. C. Chavis, RA 14456979, passenger.

2. Pilots of flight sighting reported that as the object was about 10 degrees above the horizon, 100 degrees azimuth true from the aircrft, the light disappeared and left no trail behind. Changing colors noted were red, green, and blue. Light disappeared in abrupt nature. Time of sighting or light was 6-8 minutes. There was no sound associated with the object. Comparison with the light characteristic of vapor-like trail of a flare but no trail was observed.

3. Photography was obtained of the trail by SPS Hughes Chavis. Black and white scale of photography precludes identification of object. No other personnel at Hickam AFB, Hawaii on return flight.

4. Black and white photography of SPS Chavis obtained with 120mm Reflex Camera, lens 80mm set at infinity, 1/8 second and 1/4 second; film code Agfa APA-100.

Comments of Reporting Officer: Film and information of this report were obtained from Captain _________, Operations Officer, 5th Airbase Squadron, Hickam AFB, Hawaii on return flight.
