I.  SOURCE:    RICHARD F. LUNDY, AC2, USN
              Age: 23
              Duties: Control Tower Operator
              Education: 12 years
              Qualifications: Six months duty as a control tower operator
              Station: China Lake Naval Air Facility

II. RELIABILITY: When first observed SOURCE was on duty as a control tower operator. He continued at his duties until the other individual who had seen the object was located. While at his job SOURCE appeared to be well-acquainted with his duties. SOURCE was familiar with Air traffic procedure, he was quick, alert, and aware of everything happening on the airfield although it seemed to be a nervous energy that kept him on the move. He constantly smoked, and at times seemed a little impatient. Although he answered all questions readily he didn't "go out of his way" to volunteer information. SOURCE reported to be fairly concerned about the sighting. His observations of the object were probably casual, SOURCE appeared to be of average intelligence. In spite of obvious nervousness and impatience SOURCE might be considered fairly reliable. His information, while not completely confirmed by other SOURCES, should be evaluated as "B3".

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:

1. SOURCE was on duty at the China Lake Naval Air Facility when his attention was called to the object by another tower control operator. The other Force Base to Look for an object in the northern or southern sky.

2. The object first appeared as a reddish orange ball about the size of a dime. The object appeared solid with the edges similar to those of a bright star.

3. The object was first sighted in the northwestern sky at an approximate angle of 305 degrees. The object was moving at a high rate of speed on an angle of approximately 110 degrees. It suddenly reversed course and moved on an approximate course of 290 degrees. The object finally disappeared by fading out at a measured angle of 277 degrees from the China Lake Naval Air Facility. This measurement was determined by using theodolite.

4. The object appeared at times to stand still. It also disappeared several times but not during its easterly course. SOURCE stated that the object might have moved behind the mountains to the west of the Air Facility. The object would change brightness but not in a regular pattern. It was in sight for approximately 23 to 25 minutes.

5. When SOURCE observed the object through binoculars and a telescope it appeared to have a faint conical tail four or five times the length of the object. Tail pointed away from the direction of flight.

6. SOURCE stepped out of the tower to observe the object out of the light and noticed at that time that there was no sound whatsoever.

7. SOURCE was not knowledgeable of the speed or distance of the object. The altitude was also unknown to SOURCE, although he estimated the object to be between 10 and fifteen degrees above the horizon at all times.

8. The weather was warm and dry with a slight breeze blowing. The sky was clear with fifteen miles visibility. There were a few stars but no moonlight.

Statement of AC2 Richard F. Lundy

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

When this object was sighted it was moving rapidly to the east. This object, to 1A1 appear and disappear. It faded as we lost it. It appeared to move easterly when we saw it. It was spotted with a theodolite on a bearing of 277 degrees when it disappeared. I would say that it was not a star because of the one radical move. We had this in sight approximately 23 to 25 minutes.

Flight 1-G, 4602d AISS                                 16-NOV-55                     PART THREE    11   OF   20

I. SOURCE:    CHARLES P. CHITWOOD

    Age: 22
    Duties:  Control Tower Operator
    Education: 13 years
    Qualifications: 18 months as a control tower operator
    Station: China Lake Naval Air Facility

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE's memory of the incident was very good. His
constant attitude to be on the job was very impressive. He readily volunteered
information, sketches, and maps. His continuity of the events during the sighting
was good. He seemed to remember all the facts in order. His answers to questions
were positive, with the exception of what the object might possibly have been.
SOURCE used good judgment during the sighting as evidenced by his immediate call
to the duty officer and his attempts with binoculars, telescope to identify the object. SOURCE seemed to be more knowledgable on the object than
the others, possibly because he was the first to sight it. Although SOURCE had
one year of college he seemed to have a lacking in general knowledge. SOURCE
seemed to be just a little limited. His knowledge of his job, however, was very
good. SOURCE can be rated as average. Reliability and should be considered to
be probably reliable. Information in this report should be evaluated as "I" since
it has been confirmed by two (2) other SOURCE.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:

1. SOURCE was on duty as tower operator at China Lake Naval
Air Facility on the night of 11 July 1955. SOURCE received a call from Edwards
Air Force Base, Edwards, California (Box 0854), and was asked to look for an
object in the northern or southern sky. SOURCE looked but could see nothing.
A few minutes later at 120510Z JUL 55 Edwards AFB again called and asked SOURCE
to look to the north.

2. Object was in the northern sky at a heading of 340 degrees
when first sighted. Object moved on a heading of 210 degrees for seven minutes,
then oddly reversed course and sped away on an 80 degree heading almost to the
point where first sighted. The object then reversed course again and disappeared
out of sight on a measured (by theodolite) 277 degrees heading. Disappearance was
gradual and the object seemed to gain altitude as it disappeared. Object was
approximately 10 to 15 degrees from the horizon at all times.

3. During the time that the object was in sight (23 - 25 minutes)
it appeared to stand still, suddenly speed up and/or move. It seemed to change
brightness although the color remained constant. SOURCE also stated that it
seemed to pulsate.

4. SOURCE said that the object approximated the size of a pea,
was orange with fuzzy edges. Object did not appear to change size or shape but
intensity of color changed. The object was brighter than stars in the sky.

5. Sighting through 8 power binoculars SOURCE observed a faint
conical tail four to five times the length of the object. This tail appeared
darker in color than the object proper.

6. The object disappeared six (6) times but it was nopossible to tell if it moved behind something or not. SOURCE stated, however, that it was possible that the object moved behind some mountains. Object always reappeared on a line constant with its flight line. It was not possible to tell if the object passed in front of anything.

7. The object disappeared in a westerly direction growing dimmer and dimmer. It did not disappear suddenly.

8. SOURCE originally thought object to be a jet with its afterburner switched on but when he stepped out on the ledge of the tower he heard no sound and also thought that a jet would not have its afterburner on level flight. Also the speed of the object seemed too slow for a jet.

9. The weather was cool with a little breeze blowing. A few stars were visible. It was completely dark with no moonlight.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check with the MARCH AFB, CALIFORNIA (GOCD 1454) Flight Service Center revealed that no aircraft were in the general vicinity at the time of the sighting.

2. The Duty Officer at the CHINA LAKE NAVAL AIR FACILITY at CHINA LAKE, CALIFORNIA (USGF 1707) via Interdewed (see Part One) and he stated the the Air Facility had been closed down and made secure prior to the sighting.

3. An unidentified airlines pilot on route from LAS VEGAS, NEVADA (BMCG 5210) to FRESNO, CALIFORNIA (BMCG 1115) reported a flash of light on a 310 degrees heading... The aircraft was flying a 212 degree course into BAKERT, CALIFORNIA (BMDB 1252) when the flash was noticed. The pilot was not available for statement as to the exact point from which the flash was seen in unknown. However the report mentioned only a flash and not an object such as seen by the three individuals mentioned above.

4. A check with EDWARDS AFB, EDWARDS, CALIFORNIA (BJCF 0851) revealed that a flash of light had been seen in the northern sky at 120510Z JUL 55. This was a ground visual and nothing was seen after the initial flash.

5. At 120506Z JUL 55 the AC & W site at BORON, CALIFORNIA (BJCF 1600) had an object on their scopes. They made a call to EDWARDS AFB who in turn notified the NAVAL AIR FACILITY at CHINA LAKE, CALIFORNIA. The control center operators there looked but saw nothing. Another call through the same channels resulted in the operators at CHINA LAKE (BJCF 1454) stating that later minutes later the AC & W site lost contact. This was the only instance during the sighting that radar picked up the object.

6. A check with Flight Operations at GEORGE AFB, CALIFORNIA, (BJCE 3736) revealed that they had been alerted. Two F-86D's were scrambled at 120528Z JUL 55. The F-86D's made no contact other than visually or with radar.

7. A check with Combat Operations Center, 27th Air Division (Defense) NORTON AFB, SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA (BJCE 4506) revealed that they were in contact with GEORGE AFB while the F-86D's were aloft. No action was taken by NORTON AFB, however.

8. A check with the Ground Observer Corps Filter Centers at PASADENA, CALIFORNIA (BJCB 5010) and BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA (BJAF 6023) revealed that no UFOB reports in the vicinity of the sighting had been received. The Filter Centers stated, however, that there was a great deal of network activity that night.

9. DR. BOWEN, Chief Astronomer at the MT WILSON OBSERVATORY (BJCB 5714) was contacted as to the possibility of astronomical causes. DR. BOWEN stated that since all observers are inside the observatory it is unlikely for them to sight such objects. Nothing unusual had been seen and he could give no explanation for the sightings.

10. GEORGE BEATTIE, Professor of Astronomy, San Bernardino Valley College, SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA, was interviewed for possible information on the sighting. He could give no information or explanation for the object. He did say that the length of time the object was in sight would possibly preclude the chances of the object being astronomical.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The preparing officer was unable to come to any definitive conclusion as to the cause of the sighting of an object near the CHINA LAKE NAVAL AIR FACILITY, CHINA LAKE, CALIFORNIA, on the night of 11 July 1955.

2. The following possibilities are offered for consideration:

a. Considering the length of sighting, the hovering, speeding up and the near level flight of the object suggests the possibility that the object was a balloon. The gradual disappearance in the direction (westerly) that the wind (reported from surface to 5000 feet as blowing between 10 and 40 knots) also helps the balloon theory. However, the very sudden change in course, the rapid speed attained in an easterly direction after this reversal in course and another sudden reversal in course would seem to preclude the possibility of a balloon. The faint conical tail must be considered. The tail was seen only through binocular and a telescope and night possibly have been an optical illusion caused by the glass. Also the object was between the viewers and the sun, although the sun had long since set. It is unlikely that the object would appear as large as it did (from the size of a dime held at arm's length) if it were high enough to catch the sun's rays at such a late hour. It is possible that unknown to the weather bureau a jet stream existed and the object drifted into the stream. Having placed through the stream the object then continued on its westerly course at a leisurely pace. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that although the sighted object might possibly have been a balloon, evidence indicates that this was not probable.

b. The three individuals who spotted the object were briefed on the following possibilities: a truck or car winding down mountain roads, a searchlight reflection off the mountains, the reflection of some light on the mountains. None thought any of these could apply to the sighting. Although all three were familiar with air traffic none had any ideas or conclusions concerning the object.

c. Although a great deal of meteor activity was noted on the night of 11 July 1955, the length of the duration of sighting seems to rule out the possibility of a meteor. The sudden reversal in course throws out the planet or satellite theory. The sudden flash seen by the airlines pilot and the observer at EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE might possibly have been a meteor. Although the times of the sighting of the object and the flash of light are similar, along with the same general vicinity, it is the opinion of the preparing officer that the two are not one and the same. The failure of the tower operators at CHINA LAKE NAVAL AIR FACILITY to observe the flash of light and be blinded a lack of observance since the airfield at CHINA LAKE had been shut down and occurred for the night. Neither the astronomers at MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY nor the one at SAN BERNARD NO VOLT COLLEGE had knowledge of this flash of light. Possibly the distance was too great. The preparing officer believes that the flash of light was astronomical while the sighting of the UFO was not.

d. One SOURCE (see PART THREE) at first thought the object to be a jet with a turnover switched on which might possibly explain the conical tail theory but again the length of time the object was in sight, along with its slow speed during its westerly course, preclude such a possibility. Some SOURCE located the object within the SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RESTRICTED AREA COMPLEX. It

was learned by the investigator that violations of this restricted area are very very rare. The lack of contact by F-86D's also seems to rule out the aircraft.

c. Optical phenomena seems to be the best possibility. The fact that no other individuals observed this object, although it was in sight for approximately 23 minutes, leads one to this theory. The area is sparsely populated and it is possible that other people saw it and failed to report it. The inability of the intercept plane to make either visual or electronic contact helps this possibility.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. This headquarters does not concur with the possible causes of this sighting offered by the Preparing Officer for the following reasons:

a. Balloon possibility: The sudden reversal of direction, the high rate of speed, and the conical tail would eliminate balloon activity.

b. Aircraft possibility: The duration of the sighting, the slow movement to the west, and the area of the sighting (restricted area) would eliminate the possibility of aircraft.

c. Astronomical activity: The fact that this object was initially sighted by radar, coupled with the duration of the sighting would eliminate the possibility of astronomical activity.

d. Optical phenomena: This object was initially picked up on radar and was seen by three people for a long period of time, thereby eliminating the possibility of optical phenomena.

2. This report is forwarded to ATIC as "unknown".

Flight 1-G, 1602d AISS                                    10-UCOB-11-55         PART ONE    PAGE    2    OF    20    PAGES

I. SOURCE:

Age: 42
Length of Service: 20 years
Duties: Naval Air Facility Officer (Administration)
Education: 12 years
Station: China Lake Naval Air Facility

II. RELIABILITY: When interviewed SOURCE was very cooperative with a positive attitude toward the questioning. He was very friendly, though serious, and supplied concise and detailed answers to questions. When speaking, SOURCE used good English with an excellent choice of words. His grammar and spelling on ATC Form "A" were good. SOURCE appeared to be of above average intelligence. He presented a business-like appearance and seemed to have a g'd observance of details. Although completely frank with an air traffic procedures SOURCE could offer no explanation as to what the object might have been and was insistent that the object was not a nature and normal to the activity. In view of SOURCE's sincerity, familiarity with air traffic procedures, length of service, and rank, he may be considered as normally reliable. Since two other individuals simultaneously observed the object, information contained in this report should be evaluated as "1".

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:

1. SOURCE was on duty as the Naval Air Facility Duty Officer/on the evening of 11 July 1955. He received a call from control tower operators who said that an unidentified flying object was in sight. SOURCE immediately reported to the tower.

2. The object first appeared in the northwestern sky at 306 degrees from true north and approximately 10 degrees from the horizon. It was moving on a course of approximately 210 degrees. Object stayed on this course for approximately seven (7) minutes and then suddenly reversed course. It was on this original line of flight before the change in direction that the object disappeared about six times always reappearing close to the point of disappearance but always in the flight line.

3. The object appeared round with fuzzy and/or blurred edges. SOURCE reported the distance too great to determine the exact shape. There was but one object and its size approximated that of a pea held at arm's length.

4. After observing the object for several minutes with the naked eye SOURCE tried 8 X 50 binoculars. The object was no clearer with the binoculars than with the naked eye. It appeared as an orange glow or like an open flame.

5. During its course after the reversal object seemed to speed up. Course of this second line of flight was approximately 80 degrees. When object almost reached the point of the initial sighting, it again rapidly changed course and assumed a heading of approximately 240 degrees.

As the Naval Air Facility duty officer, I was called to the field control tower to observe an orange colored light in the sky that appeared to be moving. I first observed this object at about 2215 (POST) without visual aids. I then locked at it through 8 X 50 binoculars and observed it moving in a westerly direction. The object then seemed to reverse course and gain altitude during this maneuver. It traveled at high speed. It then again moving slowly again in a westerly direction on a slight descent - disappearing in the west.
