October 24, 1953 - Concord, California

"Today at about 11:15 AM we observed a phenomenon that we should very much like to have explained:

"In the sky (it was a warm, sunny day) appeared several hundred (one estimate says 2000)

"Snowlike snow-white, gleaming objects, floating and tumbling along on the breeze. Some were high in the sky, were white specks, others traveled close to the ground and three settled in our garden: one about 4 feet by 3 feet draped itself over a rose bush, another about 10 feet by 3 or 4 feet hung in a willow tree. One small mass about 2 by 3 feet to the ground. They all looked like parts of a detergent (as one might see them in a washing machine). Snow-white, shiny, consisting of tiny foamy cells.

"It was 70 degrees in the sun as we examined the substances, yet the foam was icy cold to the touch, and it began to disintegrate immediately, leaving an icy, invisible, sticky and somewhat gritty residue. It had absolutely no odor. Less than 5 minutes after settling on the lawn, the substances completely disappeared, but we saw tiny white flecks on the trees.

"While examining these, a huge mass of foam came floating and tumbling about 50 feet up - it was at least 20 feet long and about 12 to 15 wide - and M.P."

LUBBOCK LIGHTS REPEAT

"There have been numerous sightings of formations of 'lights' in this area and over a relatively short period of time. In every instance each sighting was observed by two or more Air Force Weather Observers. All the sightings took place at night. The first sighting was by accident, those following were during planned 'Irregular Phenomena Watches', taken on by the Airmen themselves".

Sightings - (all times in Central Standard)
Time; 2015 to 2030 25 Oct 53
First sighting; 2015 Two formation passing N to S, five to seven lights (or glowing disc) shining with a dull white glow. Raised from approximately angle in sky, 90 degrees (straight up) to 30 degrees in two or three seconds. They seemed to be quite high, at least above 15,000 ft.

Second sighting; 2020 (approx) Two groups, no formation or number discernible, moving N to S or about 30 degrees high in the west or quadrant. No heights ventured except the first group was higher yet closer to our observation point. The second group moved much slower than the first, to our vision.

Third sighting; 2025 (approx) One group of two discs moving N to S. 65 degrees high in western quadrant, high and moving fast. In view total of two seconds.

Fourth sightings; 2030 One group of two discs coming from the NW vearing out of sight toward the east. Passed directly over observation point. In view a total of about one second.

Time: 2345 25 Oct 53
Sighted largest "V" formation yet, from eight to twelve glowing points moving from N then veering out of sight to the west. Extremely high if they were the same size of those previously sighted. In sight about three seconds.

Time: 2110 31 Oct 53
Sighted large "V" formation from the NW veering to SE, directly overhead, height and speed not discernible by observer.


- page 5 -

Second sightings: 215 (approx) Sighted largest "V" formation yet, nine to twelve glowing discs or lights of very dull white light. Low on west horizon, computed not to be too high and moving much slower than any other previous sightings. The "V" formation did not seem to be equated by the effects of perspective due the distance. It seemed that if this was the case then each "light" was at a different level and in formation much like World War Two strategic bombing formations.

This of course is a presumption but is based on what was seen.

Since these sightings the Observers of the weather station have been keeping their eyes open on all good observation nights for more of these Irregular Phenomena. These are all the sightings we have observed to date.

I would like to point out that all sightings in this letter were seen by one or more qualified Weather Observers who are familiar with Atmospheric Phenomena. All but one (the sighting on 25 Oct 53 at 2035) which is not supported in this letter, were definite sightings and so question as to confusion with natural phenomena is brought up.
