ACTION

The object appeared to be moving across the sky and maintaining level attitude on a rapid climb without material change. The attitude was clear and appeared to have a velocity altitude approach approaching as might be determined by a radar operator.

BASED ON FLIGHT BY TWO OFFICER TO ITS OBJECT OF - A REPORT OF - A TO 25 OCT 1952 TO DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES, U.S. AIR FORCE, WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

1. ON 9 OCT 52, AT ABOUT 1836 CST, TWO OFFICERS OF THIS COMMAND OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT BY THE AIR BASE AND IN THE VICINITY FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES.

2. THE VISUAL WAS SUCH AS TO BE CLASSIFIED BY THE AIR FORCE AS OPTICAL OR METEOROLOGICAL.

3. DESCRIPTION: THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT, SPHERICAL IN SHAPE, AND MOVING VERY RAPIDLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE IN A HORIZONTAL PLANE. IT WAS OBSERVED FROM THE CONTROL TOWER, AND THE OBJECT WAS TRACKED ON RADAR.

4. ESTIMATING MOVEMENT AND ALTITUDE: THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE TRAVELLING AT A SPEED OF 600 MPH OR MORE, AND AT AN ALTITUDE OF FROM 20,000 TO 30,000 FEET. IT COVERED A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES IN LESS THAN 20 SECONDS, ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS.

5. ON 10 OCT 52, AT ABOUT 12:50 AM CST, THE SAME TWO OFFICERS AGAIN OBSERVED A SIMILAR OBJECT, MOVING IN A SIMILAR MANNER, BUT FOR A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. THEY ESTIMATED ITS ALTITUDE AND SPEED TO BE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS OBSERVATION.

6. THE OBJECT EXHIBITED NO TRAIL, SMOKE, OR ANY OTHER VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION. IT WAS OBSERVED TO CHANGE DIRECTION SEVERAL TIMES DURING BOTH SIGHTINGS.

7. WEATHER: AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTINGS, THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND CALM, AND NO UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS WERE REPORTED BY THE WEATHER BUREAU.

1. In confirmation of our TWX, 78 CO 4625, and in the absence of availability of AF Form 112, "Air Intelligence Information Report," this letter is submitted in accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 29 April 1952.

2. Description

The objects sighted were described as aluminum colored, disc-shaped, or round. They were silver color with a blueish cast, and the size approximately that of a B-36 aircraft. There was no indication of exhaust trails or oral or visual indication of a means of propulsion. The object was observed from the main site of Truax Field, Madison, Wisconsin, in a direction approximately west-south-west and at an angular elevation of approximately 40 degrees.

The objects glowed and appeared to be moving slowly toward the east on a level altitude. The object then appeared to begin a rapid climb without any visible means of propulsion and disappeared from view in a matter of a very high altitude.

3. The time of sighting was 16:55Z (1035 CST). The line of sight was for approximately 30 seconds.

4. Observation was visual by two Air Police men on duty at the main gate. They had no use of optical or electronic equipment.

5. The coordination of the point of observation is N3 degrees, 8 minutes north and 89 degrees, 20 minutes west. Relative position as indicated by the observers was over the city of Madison, but could not be specific with respect to distance and altitude. They were in close agreement about direction.

6. The airmen observing the object were M/Sgt Harold F. Hundt, 5130282, and AIC June T. Hardy, AF16141632.

Statement (W/2c Gear)

FOR THE COMMANDING OFFICER:

/s/ RON A. LUCOS
2nd Lt., USAF
Adjutant

It must be noted that this station is within the immediate vicinity of Selfridge AFB, Michigan, and the objects observed had characteristics which might be confused with aircraft that might be observed in that vicinity. It should also be noted that the speed does not concur with the length of sight as an aircraft or object moving at that speed would disappear from view in less than 30 seconds.

The weather conditions at the sighting were clear, visibility 15 miles; surface wind, 5 knots north northwest; and the upper wind was 25 to 30 knots north-northwest.

As stated in paragraph 8, it is estimated possibly that the object involved was a standard aircraft traveling at some distance and at about the same time jet aircraft traveling at some distance and with the sound of landing aircraft, could thus appear to be moving without trail or visible means of propulsion.

There is no physical evidence such as photographs, etc.
No interception or identification action was taken.

The statement of W/2c Oger, one of the observers, is attached, and W/2c Hamm's statement will be forwarded at a later date as airmen in on pass at present time.

STATEMENT

On Thursday, 30 October 1952, I, Lewis E. Goar was standing guard on gate #1 at 1035 when I spotted an unidentified aircraft traveling in the direction of west south-west at a high speed. The object had the form of an egg and a blue cast to it. It was flying at eight (8) to ten (10) thousand feet and climbing steadily. I watched it for about 15 to 20 seconds until it disappeared in a haze. I/We Jones and I then reported the incident to the Air Police Operations Section.
