1. In confirmation of our TWX, 78 CQ 4625, and in the absence of availability of AF Form 112, Air Intelligence Information Report, this letter is submitted in accordance with AFL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952.

2. Description
   The object sighted was described by personnel concerned as egg-shaped, of a silver color with a bluish cast, and the size approximately that of a B-36 aircraft. There was no indication of exhaust trail or oral or visual indication of a means of propulsion. The object was observed from the main gate of Truax Field, Madison, Wisconsin, in a direction approximately west south-west and at an angular elevation of approximately 50 degrees. The object appeared to be moving south at the time of the initial observation, turning slowly toward the east on a level attitude. The object then appeared to begin a rapid climb without material change in attitude, and disappeared from view in a haze of a very high altitude at an angular elevation of approximately 80 degrees. The speed of the object was estimated by the observers to exceed F-86 frequency.

3. The time of sighting was 0635Z (1035 CST). The line of sight was for approximately 30 seconds.

4. Observation was visual by two Air Police men on duty at the main gate. They had no use of optical or electronic equipment.

5. The coordination of the point of observation is 43 degrees, 8 minutes north and 89 degrees, 20 minutes west. Relative location of object with respect to observers is indicated in Paragraph 2. The observers indicated that the object appeared to be over the city of Madison, but could not be specific with respect to distance and altitude. They were in close agreement about direction.

6. The airmen observing the object were A/2c Harold T. Hamm, AF 19386822, age 21, 2 year service, 1 year 7 months at Truax Field.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

78TH ASTRA INTELLIGENCE (NIOERT)

and A/2c Louis E. Geer, AF 15471813, age 19, completing 1 year of service
next month. Both men had opportunity to observe aircraft and were
positive in there statements and beliefs that the object was not an
aircraft of a type with which they are familiar. Airman Hamm first
observed the object and called Airmen Geer to confirm his observation.

It must be noted that this station is within the immediate vicinity of
Glenview Naval Air Station, which has jet aircraft of a type which might
not be familiar to Air Force personnel. It should also be noted that
the speed does not concur with the length of sight as an aircraft or
object moving at that speed would disappear from view in less than
30 seconds.

7. Weather conditions at the sighting were clear, visibility,
15 miles; surface wind, 5 knots north northwest; and the upper wind
was 25 knots north north-west.

8. As stated in Paragraph 6, it is estimated possibly that the object
involved was a Naval Aircrft. One indication is the appearance of a bluish
cast to the object. A naval jet aircraft traveling at some distance and
altitude at the same time jet aircraft were landing at this station, and
with the sound of landing aircraft, could thus appear to be moving without
oral or visible means of propulsion.

9. There is no physical evidence such as photographs, etc.

10. No interception or identification action was taken.

11. There was a flight of F-86's landing at the time sighting occurred.
This was in observation of this flight of F-86's that observers first noticed
this strange object.

12. The statement of A/2c Geer, one of the observers, is attached,
and A/2c Hamm's statement will be forwarded at a later date as airmen
in on pass at present time.

STATEMENT

On Thursday, 30 October 1952, I, A/2c Lewis E. Geer was standing guard on gate #1 at 1035 when I spotted an unidentified aircraft traveling in the direction of west south-west at a high speed. The object had the form of an egg and a blue cast to it. It was flying at eight (8) to ten (10) thousand feet and climbing steadily. I watched it for about 15 to 20 seconds until it disappeared in a haze. A/2c Hemm and I then reported the incident to the Air Police Operations Section.
