Diameter of course unknown, moving horizontally and at a steady
in a rather smooth, continuous motion of size 600 feet. It hovered for a
few seconds then changing from its near or full side to a large
gray 1/2 diameter towards the west (12 O'clock) direction, slowly
rolling to the left, then last viewed was approximately 20 miles away

                                    Scott Air Force Base, Illinois

DATE OF REPORT: 23 March 1953       DATE OF INFORMATION: 30 March 1953
PREPARED BY: Captain James H. Webb   EVALUATION: F-6

SUBJECT: Civilian Employee

SUMMARY:
Civilian employee at Scott AF Base, Illinois, sighted an object which he first thought was a dirigible. Object was just above trees now slowly from South to North. First sighted at 1 o'clock position. When it reached 12 o'clock position its course changed (without change) Like relative heading) and came toward the observer at "terrific" speed, stopping about 2 mile away where it hovered for a few seconds. It was surrounded by a mist about one bank that formed to obscure it somewhat. The object was dull silver in color, approximately six hundred (600) feet across, between one hundred (100) and three hundred (300) feet ground, 16 to 20 miles away in a matter of some few seconds, slowly rolling to the left, but without turning or gaining altitude.

Last sighted was about twenty (20) miles away in a forty five (45) degree bank, disappearing into some white clouds, which observer believes made by the object.

In significant of this sighting, the observer has had nervous or emotional disturbance. No other sounds or reasonable enough. Follow-up action will be taken and any other findings will be reported.

EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY

19 May 53

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss Gluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method is has obvious drawbacks. But until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the 1st report I've seen of an honest to goodness mirage. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.

8 April was a meteor.
The Great Falls 3 April case was Venus if reported time was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was probably Venus.
31 March Honshu, and 30 March Lyle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.

The 8-April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

This brings us to the interesting cases:
25 March San Antonia could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Anything more come in on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as Nocturnal, meandering light.

29 March Spooner, "Misc. Duration times needs checking here. Hard to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular questionnaire's should be sent to Mr. Gilette.

Next is the 12 April Stead AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you receive more dope on it. Questionnaires should be sent to the local panel. Apparently this was a helicopter? Apparently ducks have been eliminated. As for the 26 March, Equasseur AFB although NL, the data are too traditional. Insufficient. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to have much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,
[Signature]
