Stationary

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bright silvery obj observed in same position for a period of seven mins when it was obscured by clouds. Position was North of Northwest at 45 degree elevation. Sky was overcast.

11. COMMENTS
Nothing on radar in the area. Since obj was stationary & the condition was overcast w/haze the sighting was attributed to the star Capella, Capella was in the appropriate position & the unusual characteristics are assumed due to the atmospheric conditions present at the time.

Dear Miss

This is to acknowledge the family letter of 16 April 1958 concerning the unidentified flying object you sighted that day.

With the limited information we cannot definitely identify the object. However, astronomical plots indicate the object could have been that star Capella. There is also the possibility that the object could have been a running light on a weather balloon. Weather balloons launched at night carry lights for tracking purposes.

Radar reports from the Van Wert area that night reveal nothing unusual.

Your report will be added to our continuing study of aerial phenomena. Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
