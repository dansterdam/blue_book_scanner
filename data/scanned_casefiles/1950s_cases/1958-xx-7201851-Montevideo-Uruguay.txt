COMMENTS (in narrative style, expand on your evaluation as checked above. Your comments, evidence and helpful criticism are
appreciated by collectors. Carefully prepared and detailed Evaluation Records will improve the quality of reporting and
provide you with intelligence information of higher quality.)

The information supplied in this report is very limited. However, the facts which are included point very strongly toward the object, sighted by the various witnesses, being a fireball. A fireball is a meteor of unusual size and brilliance (brighter than -3 magnitude). Another characteristic of fireballs consistent with the report is the possibility of color change during flight, white, blue, green, orange, red, yellow, pink and purple being the normal color range. Fireballs are rare in occurrence and follow no set pattern. It is unusual for an individual to see more than one or two in a lifetime. The fact that a sighting is usually a first experience for the observer accounts for their startling effect. The limited information in the report makes the Barrios case unexplainable. It is believed that were additional data available a suitable explanation could be made. Specific information missing from the consolidated report of the CIOVI (Center for Investigating Unidentified Flying Objects) includes such data as direction of motion, elevation and duration of observation. Inspecting Mr. [redacted] individual report there seems to be some discrepancy in time, the first half of the report indicates 2030 and the last portion 1420.

Conclusion - The witnesses in all instances, except possibly the Barrios' 1430 sighting, observed a fireball.
