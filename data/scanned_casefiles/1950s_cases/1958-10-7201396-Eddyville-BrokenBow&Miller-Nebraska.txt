1. ALL OBSERVERS MADE GROUND VISUAL OBSERVATIONS BOTH WITH NAKED EYE AND OPTICAL AIDS.

2. FIRST OPTICAL AID EMPLOYED WAS BINOCULARS, 6X30 REPEAT 6X30. STANDARD GCC ISSUED TYPE, NOT OTHERWISE IDENTIFIED EXCEPT VALUE 30 DOLLARS. WITH BINOCULARS BOTH RED AND GREEN LIGHTS WERE OBSERVABLE (WITHOUT BINOCULARS ONLY GREEN LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED). A 50 POWER TELESCOPE WAS EMPLOYED. THIS TELESCOPE IS A KIT SCOPE ASSEMBLED BY AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER, MR. [REDACTED], AGE 63, EDDYVILLE NEBRASKA, BY OCCUPATION, A US POSTAL MAILMAN. THE TELESCOPE CONSIST OF A ONE INCH EYEPIECE, TWO INCH OBJECTIVE LENS WITH FIFTY INCH FOCAL LENGTH.

THERE ARE NO MIRCRS. THIS IS A SEE-THROUGH TYPE TELESCOPE.

WITH THE TELESCOPE THE FORMATION OF LIGHTS WAS DISCERNIBLE BUT NO DETAILS OF THE OBJECT ITSELF COULD BE OBSERVED.

C3. NO SIGHTING WAS MADE FROM AN AIRBORNE AIRCRAFT. HOWEVEARAN F66 TYPE AIR CRAFT WAS VECTORED TO THE AREA AND OBSERVED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE OBJECT AND APPARENTLY IN THE SAME VISUAL ALTITUDE PLANE.

THE AIRCRAFT WAS UNDER POSITIVE GCI CONTROL. A DETAILED REPORT OF THIS ATTEMPTED INTERCEPT WILL FOLLOW BY SEPARATE MSG.

STATEMENT

1. After a discussion with North Platte GOC and Able Bodied, I called Picnic GCI and asked them to divert the high man on fuel in Sombrero Blue Flight for Idaho control to check a UFO, AE 01552 Sombrero Blue 1 was diverted to Idaho GCI in JL 5010.

2. Sombrero Blue 1 was vectored directly to the object area in FM 2221 at 35,000 feet. To facilitate positioning the interceptor as close to the object as possible it was requested that GOC obtain a visual contact with the interceptor. This was accomplished by the aircraft slowing down enough to lower his landing light. As soon as GOC contact was obtained (first at Broken Bow, Nebraska) the landing light was turned off and retried and a vector given to the objects position. Eddyville, Nebraska maintained contact with the interceptor by watching the contrails. As vectors were received from GOC the aircraft was vectored to the object. Two passes were then made at the object and no visual or airborne radar contact was obtainable. During these two passes the pilot requested information on the objects position in relation to the moon, which when received and relayed to the pilot placed the object 15 nautical miles west of the moon. The pilot did not see anything in this position. The interceptor could not descend below 32,000 feet because of fuel and distance from nearest recovery base.

3. The pilot checked with lights on the ground and could see nothing that could possibly correspond to the objects light pattern. The reason for checking was the possibility that the observers were seeing some light on the ground that was being reflected by the temperature inversion. A temperature inversion was existing between 3,000 and 5,500 feet. Positive GCI control was maintained at all times with Blue 1a.

4. A request was placed with CAA (Kansas City Center) through Able Bodied to ask several aircraft flying through the area to report any unusual lights in the sky. Several airliners flying at 20,000 and 23,000 feet reported nothing appeared unusual.

5. No radar contact was ever obtained by Idaho with the object.

6. This is a true and accurate account of the UFO incident (Intercept position) occurring on 30 October 1958 at 0100Z.

STATEMENT

On October 29, 1958 at approximately 0214 while running practice intercepts as #1 in a Flight of three F-86AW's under Picnic Control, I was advised to contact Idaho Control.

On contact with Idaho, the controller requested I proceed to a point near Eddyville, Nebraska. I did so under his direction at 35,000 ft. altitude.

While enroute, I was given the following description of U.F.O.B. sighted in the area by G.O.C. "The object is circular in shape with red and green lights around it, altitude unknown, but at a distance that made it appear to be the size of a dime coin which is moving slowly to the East." At the time I was enroute the weather was clear with very good visibility due to the very bright moonlight.

Upon reaching the area, I searched in all directions, also above and below with no success. At this time I requested G.O.C. to get visual contact on me and steer to the object visually. I reduced speed and extended the landing light for better identification by G.O.C.

G.O.C. relayed their instructions through Idaho controller and on several occasions advised that I was passing very near to object.

I was unable to get any contact either visually or on the radar scope.

I continued the search as long as fuel permitted, about 20 minutes, and then returned to Lincoln Air Force Base and landed.
