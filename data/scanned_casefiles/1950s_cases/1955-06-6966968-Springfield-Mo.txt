APPROXIMATELY 212 ZEBRA, 22 JUN 55. THE NEXT DAY AN NCO AND MYSELF QUESTIONED THE TWO OBSERVERS AND FILLED OUT THE QUESTIONNAIRES.

BOTH MEN WERE VERY SINCERE. IN ITS WAY THEY EXPLAINED THE SIGHTING TO ME. NO DESCRIPTION COULD BE GIVEN EXCEPT FOR THE OBJECT BEING ROUND AND GIVING OFF A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT. OBJECT WAS AT AN ESTIMATED FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED FT. HIGH, IN A DOWNWARD DESCENDING ANGLE OF 3 DEGREES, SPEED 2 MPH. FROM THE QUESTIONERS AND COMMENTS OF THE TWO OBSERVERS, I BELIEVE IT TO BE POSSIBLY AN AIRCRAFT, EXCEPT THAT THE LIGHT GIVEN OFF THE THE OBJECT WAS STEADY AND NOT FLUCTUATING.
