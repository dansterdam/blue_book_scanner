sighted it between the fork of a tree, there we
were more positive of its big size and movement.
It did not give us impressions of being off in
the distance as the moon or stars. Was dim
and much slower.

On Feb. 27, 1953. Friday morning - 6:00 a.m.
I sighted a similar object, round and of
same color, watched it fade from view in
20 to 25 seconds. This was much lighter
further away, though in the same footprint
direction and degree to my eyeline.

On Tuesday evening, Feb. 24, 1953, at 4:30 am. I noticed an flying object, yellow orange in color in the sky. First impression was the movement after a few seconds it really did it was not so quickly grew to a full circle, the lower part forming first. (9999) Also seemed to be making towards me. Was very low and large. Though bright in color it did not seem to give off any light to the surroundings. Watched it approximately three minutes when met movement, about two to three minutes with the object that came. No trace of any air or light object. Heard no unusual sounds at any time.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

Statement by [redacted]

At approximately 1940 hours, 24 February 1953, my wife and I left the apartment at 1403 East Charles St., Sherman, Texas, to go to the theater. While I was opening the garage to get out the car, my wife walked down the driveway waiting for me. She called and said, "What is that?" I walked over to where she was and observed "what appeared to be a red light shining through the overcast. At first, I thought it was a passing light on an aircraft, approaching directly toward me. Then it was observed to slowly and climb at a slow rate (see drawing), and then vanished similar to an observed light bulb at fifteen (15) feet when switched off.

The red object was surrounded by a red halo in the overcast that equaled approximately five (5) times the width of the object. There was no sound of an aircraft engine at the time of the sighting or for five minutes following the sighting, at which time I went into the house to phone a report. There was no other sound that I could identify as being emitted from the object. The total time of observation was 3 to 7 seconds.

After calling Intelligence, I had my wife sit down and write out her impressions of what she had noticed, which are attached, and I accomplished the attached drawing. I had the impression that the object was not a complete sphere but had a slight protuberance on the top. I asked my wife if she considered the object a perfect sphere. She stated, "No, it looked similar to a blown soap bubble just previous to breaking away from the blow pipe, slightly elongated at the top."

The following morning I called Weather and found that at the time of sighting the ceiling was 1400 feet and overcast was very thin and could almost be seen through.

Perrin Air Force Base, Tex                                                PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

(1) Only one object was observed by CWO [redacted] but two were observed by Mrs. [redacted] One of them having disappeared by the time CWO [redacted] reached a vantage point of observation, objects were round in shape with a halo around each, the halos being about five times the width of the objects. The color of objects was bright red and remained consistently so. There were no other lights or colors which might indicate an exhaust. The speed of objects was undetermined by observer; both objects remained in an areast formation with one slightly ahead part of the time. Both objects appeared to be rotating in circles while remaining in one locality and then began ascending in an unestimated rate of speed while simultaneously fading away in a manner resembling an electric light bulb when current is turned off. One object disappeared approximately two seconds before the other one.

(2) The two objects were sighted at 1943 hours, Central Standard Time, 24 February 1953 and were observed for three to seven seconds.

(3) Observation was visual from two persons on the ground.

(4) Location of observers was 33° 38'N, 96° 37'W in Sherman, Texas; objects were about 2 o'clock angle from observations at an undetermined altitude.

(5) The two observers have not previously experienced the observation of an unidentified object but Warrant Officer [redacted] is considered reliable.

(6) There was an overcast at 1400 feet with calm winds at time of sighting.

(7) There was no known condition, meteorological or otherwise which would have accounted for the sighting.

(8) There is no known existence of evidence such as fragments, photographs, etc of the sighting.

(9) When the sighting was made, the two observers telephoned Intelligence personnel at Perrin AFB, Tex but due to the brief period of observation, not in excess of seven seconds, no action towards an intercept was possible.

(10) An inquiry at nearby Perrin AFB, Tex revealed that no aircraft or weather balloons were known to be in the area at time of sighting.

Observation of Mrs. [redacted]

We went outdoors. We were going to a show. The time was twenty minutes to 8 p.m. CST. My husband went to the garage - I walked the length of the driveway, waiting for him to drive the car out. I then looked up and shouted, "Say, what's this?" I saw two round objects in the sky, unusually visible, through the thick overcast sky. The time was 7:45 p.m. Then between 7:50 and 8 p.m. These two objects seemed fiery red, one seemed higher than the other. Both seemed to be climbing. When my husband came upon the scene, the bottom object seemed to speedily go into an oscillation as if climbing and disappeared. But one remained, just as fiery as ever, which my husband saw - it lasted a fleeting second, and it too behaved exactly like the other, and disappeared.

26 March 1953

Dear Dr. Hynek:

We have been receiving your comments and evaluations on the waves we have been sending you work by work and we have been very helpful. We can then look to you, as we have been doing, for continued help in evaluating many of our astronomical or Venus sightings, etc., as you stated in your last letter.

Concerning the sightings we have been sending you, I can't see many apparently experienced sources such as pilots and control tower operators are fooled by Venus, but I can see why it may look incorporated ones.

We estimate that about 25 of our members of January, February, and March reports can be attributed to this astronomical body. We are occurring in most cases, as I stated before, they stack up pretty well.

As far as following on the valuable sightings are concerned:

(1) Fort Austin, AF Imagery - Correlation visual and radar - have asked then for an amplifying memo on the no data version. Radar pick-up and the visual sighting are actually of the same object. The radar personnel involved have been asked to fill out our Electronics Data Sheets which is our form A-12. Pending and radar A-12 action, specialists will evaluate it for possible weather interference, size of track, etc. Have also requested temperature, wind, altitude, elapsed time, etc. points such as weather, altitude, wind direction, etc. When all this could information arrives we will piece it together and try and evolve a conclusion. This sighting has top priority at Blue Book.

(2) The Shreveport sighting of 27 February likewise Sherman, Texas, 25 February are being followed up by our standard questionnaire as you suggested.

Concerning Dr. Howell's proposed contract: We don't buy it other in the present form. I would like to get together with you and talk this over as we have done with Dr. Eplen of U.C.L.A. who, incidentally, thinks it shows sloppy thinking but has merit here and there. He suggests that we talk to whole thing over with Howell first I don't like this idea. In the first place, we know that one can't explain all minor sightings by mirage when it is the core of his whole plan.

Will telephone you in the near future on this and other matters. Ed has let our Denver Intelligence school, so we have no as temporary help on this project until a replacement can be found for the watching people.

Dayton, Ohio                                                  24 February 1953

I.   Description of Incident

A civilian woman contacted ATIC concerning a yellowish-white object which she had observed at 0130 EST for two successive days for periods ranging from 3 to 30 minutes. The object was described as oblong shaped and very low on the horizon with the manner of disappearance in both sightings being caused by its sinking below the horizon. The object was seen at a due west position each time.

II.  Discussion of Incident

The source, although of average intelligence, is not an experienced observer and it is quite certain that she witnessed the setting of an astronomical body such as Venus.

III. Conclusion

Probably astronomical.
