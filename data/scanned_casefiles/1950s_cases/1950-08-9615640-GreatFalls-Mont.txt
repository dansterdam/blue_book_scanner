Mr. [REDACTED]
Great Falls, Montana

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

You are probably aware of the fact that the Air Force stations have been investigating the flying saucer phenomenon and attempting to make a comprehensive analysis of recent sightings against those made in previous years. In this connection, the report of a sighting dated by [REDACTED] that you mentioned has come to our attention.

Therefore, we would be most grateful if you could permit us to borrow/your original motion picture film for study and duplication. In so doing you would be rendering us a great service.

We will have an officer from Great Falls Air Force Station contact you shortly 28 October and should you consider our request favorably, he will obtain the movies and give you a receipt for them. We will, of course, return them as soon as possible.

Your cooperation and consideration in this matter is earnestly solicited.

Sincerely,

NOV 14 1952

Great Falls, Montana

Dear Mr. ???,

We wish to express our sincere appreciation for the assistance which you extended to us in connection with your review. We had difficulty in obtaining results, but those will be used for official purposes only, of course.

Instead of mailing the film, as the torn caption, as discussed with you previously, it is apparent with celluloid tearing shows it happened probably during shipment as well as the contents of the film. We regret the inconvenience caused, but sincerely hope that the reimbursement has adequately covered any expense which you may have incurred. Since the return will not be possible, we make a permanent action as soon as possible.

The nature of this definite contribution is our current analysis. It is impossible for us to add any further comments about them until much thing is determined regarding the relationship with the basis for some definite conclusions, if any is possible.

Again we tender our sincere thanks for your cooperation and hope that the film's absence has not caused you any hardship.

Sincerely,

VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING, THREE FIGHTER-BOMBERS TOOK OFF FROM THE GREAT FALLS AIR FORCE BASE. SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THEY SIGHTED FOUR UNUSUAL OBJECTS IN THE AIR. ASSIGNED TO A ROUTINE MISSION, BOMBING AND STRAFING A TRUCK CONVOY, THESE OBJECTS FOLLOWED THEM FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES FROM THE YAAK RIVER. THE PILOTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO CONTINUE THEIR MISSION, AND THEY DID SO. THE OBJECTS KEPT PACE WITH THEM SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR. RADAR OBSERVERS HAD THEIR EYES ON THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS.

IT WAS WATCHING THE GROUND BELOW FOR THE CONVOY THEY WERE TO BOMB. THEY REPORTED THAT THESE UNKNOWN OBJECTS KEPT PACE WITH THEM, SOMETIMES PULLING AHEAD, THEN DROPPING BACK, AND ONE OF THEM APPEARED TO BE SURROUNDED ON THE WEST AND EAST BY MOUNTAINS, WITH A HAZY PURPLE GLOW SURROUNDING IT. IT WAS NO TROUBLE FOR THESE OBJECTS TO KEEP PACE WITH THEM, TRAVELING SOME 500 MILES PER HOUR OR FASTER.

THEY WERE ALSO GOING AT A GOOD CLIP OF ABOUT 1000 OR 1200 MILES PER HOUR ACCORDING TO THEIR INSTRUMENTS. WHEN THE OBJECTS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO HALT, BACK UP AND BEGIN A ZOOMING MANEUVER, OF COURSE, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THEY SHOULD FIRE THEIR GUNS. HOWEVER, WHEN THEY TRIED TO SHOOT, THEIR GUNS WOULD NOT FIRE. THEY BELIEVE THEIR GUNS WERE RENDERED USELESS BY TURNING DOWN THE SENSITIVITY, BUT THIS HAD NO EFFECT. REALIZING THAT THEIR RADAR SCREEN SHOWED THAT THE OBJECTS HAD MANEUVERED OR MOVED SOME FOUR OR FIVE TIMES FASTER THAN THEY COULD, THEY GAVE UP THE IDEA OF TRYING TO SHOOT AT THEM.

THEN THE BUZZING SOUND CAME ON AGAIN, AND WHEN THE OBJECTS WERE STILL JITTERING OUT THERE AHEAD OF THEM, THEY DECIDED TO HEAD FOR CARRIER. THE THINGS BEGAN MANEUVERING AROUND OUR PLANES, CIRCLING ABOVE AND BELOW, AND I LEARNED AFTER WE REACHED OUR CARRIER THAT THEY SAW THE OTHER MEN IN THAT FORMATION TRY UNSUCCESSFULLY TO TAKE A SHOT AT THEM, BUT THEIR GUNS WOULDN'T FIRE. THEY WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR SIZES, EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE AT LEAST 600 OR POSSIBLY 700 FEET IN DIAMETER.

WHEN THEY DISAPPEARED, THEY DID SO WITH A REDDISH GLOW SURROUNDING THEM.  THEY WERE SHAPED SOMEWHAT LIKE A COOKIE-CUTTER TYPE HAT, WITH A CONVEX TOP AND CONCAVE BOTTOM.  PORTABLE PASTEL-COLORED LIGHTS AND BACK TO THE COPPER-GREEN AGAIN. ABOVE THE MIDDLE OF THE UNDERSIDE WAS A CIRCULAR AREA OF COAL BLACK AND NON-REFLECTIVE, IT WAS SIMPLY TINY BLACK AND IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR BOTTOM WAS STEADY AND SHOWED NO INDICATION OF MOVEMENT, THE MIDDLE OF THE UNDERSIDE WAS SIMPLY TINY BLACK AND IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR BOTTOM WAS STEADY AND SHOWED NO INDICATION OF MOVEMENT, WHEN THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED THEY TOOK OFF IN THE SAME DIRECTION FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME, AND DISAPPEARED.

1. Transmitted under separate cover is approximately fifteen feet of 16mm moving picture film taken by Mr. Gerald Heroux, Great Falls, Montana, who is a director of the Great Falls baseball team. 

2. These movies were made on 15 August 1950 between the hours of 11:25 and 11:30 p.m. over a drive-in theater located in Great Falls, Montana, near the airfield operated by the 341st Bomb Wing. It shows an object described as being elongated, about the size of a car, brilliant white in color, and without wings, tail, or other appurtenances. It appeared to be hovering and later to move rapidly from a northerly to a southeasterly direction at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately ten thousand feet and at a distance of about three-quarters of a mile from the observer's location. The motion of the object is described as completely silent, and it observed that the witness stated that he ran outdoors and outside the car from which the pictures were taken. Examination of the film by this office disclosed that it does actually record the motion of an unidentified flying object as described.

3. The water tower in instant pictures is located approximately seven hundred feet in a southwesterly direction from the point at which the pictures were taken, and the lower is approximately one hundred seventy-five feet in height.

RELATIVE TO OBSERVER:
1. Name of observer: Great Falls, Montana
2. Address of observer: Unknown
3. Occupation: Air Force, Veteran's Administration Hospital
4. Pertinent hobbies: Observe 1 to 2 hours on clear nights carefully
5. Interests: Not particularly interested in photography, radio or flying discs but ability to determine colors, speed and direction of motion did provide useful observations.
6. Ability to determine colors, speed and direction of motion of objects of observer should be relatively good in view of his experience as a pilot.
7. Lighting conditions: Excellent. Observed against dark background of hills and sky. No moon observed.
8. Notes relative to observer: In general, a very competent observer and trustworthy. He had observed and reported other unidentified flying objects and had previously thought that they could not be such unidentional objects. The observer's attention was called to the objects by the strange motion, speed and direction.

THE CASE
5 or 15 Aug 1950
Two Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) were sighted and photographed
at about 11:30 MST on August 15, 1950 by Mr. Great
Falls, Montana. Mr. owns and operates a radio station in
Missoula, Montana, and is the owner of the Great Falls baseball team. It
was during an inspection of this ball park that the sighting took place.
(and his secretary, also present at the time) first noticed the
UFO's as silvery objects to the NW, accidentally when looking to tell the
wind by the smoke from the Anaconda Copper Company smokestack nearby.
The UFO's drew his attention to the fact that he can 60 feet from the
grandstand to the parking lot, got his motion picture camera (Revere turret
type 16mm) out of his car and began tracking the UFO's which appeared
to him to have stopped in mid-air, remained stationary for a while and then,
with a swooshing sound floated away to the left (SW keeping about the same
distance from each other until they were lost from sight.
The color film (Daylight Kodachrome) was submitted to the Air Force.
It was studied and analyzed by the Air Force and the U.S. Navy.
The original Air Force conclusion, based on the interrogation of
witnesses and the evaluation of the data, was that the UFO's were, in all
probability, two Air Force F-94 fighter aircraft known to be in the
vicinity at the time.

The text discusses the details of the film, including the location, the sighting and photographing of the UFOs, and the subsequent analysis of the film. It mentions that the color film (Daylight Kodachrome) was submitted by the Montana Air National Guard after the observation and photographing of the objects in the sky.

Text transcribed from the document:

PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE "MONTANA" FILM TRACKING TWO UFO'S

Two Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) were sighted and photographed at about 11:37 PM on August 15, 1950 at Great Falls, Montana. The film was obtained by the USAF Operations, Air Material Command, Intelligence, through the cooperation of the Anaconda Copper Company, and it is the property of the U.S. Government. 

It was during the inspection of this ball park that the sighting took place. (And his recollection that the lighting conditions were such that he could see the UFO's as silhouettes against the sky line.)

The film was sent to the Kodachrome original, as returned to him, comprised 335 frames. This original film was shown by him before several service clubs and other interested public meetings, indicating the genuineness of the film and the interest created by the objects by which they could be seen to rotate in union while on the film. 

The film as returned by the Air Force, according to Mr. F. was the only copy that had been permitted to have been made. (He had the film closely guarded but would permit viewing to other interested parties.

Eventually, the original film came into the possession of Greenfield Productions, at Sam Goldwyn Studios, 1041 North Formosa Street, Hollywood, Calif when it was loaned and released in 35mm sepiaprint of it was prepared for documentary use.

The photometric analysis was recommended by ATTIC personnel in 1950.

This document does not contain any photographs. It is an analysis of photographic material, describing the visual study of reprints in both cinema projection and frame-by-frame examination using a recording device. The text discusses the quality and characteristics of the reprints, including their brightness, sharpness, and the apparent visual distortions. The document also mentions the use of an overlay celluloid to trace the relative motion of objects in the images. Additionally, it references the recording of azimuth and altitude data of the mid-point on the line of the objects under these conditions.

Analysis of Photographic Material
-2-	Serial 01

Visual study of the reprints, in both cinema projection and frame-by-frame examination on a Recordak, an iconology of traveling microscopes. The original data was collected on a solarized film. The reprinted film copies from this original but apparently were applied correctly for the reprinting. On many of the frames they are largest and brightest on the first ten or twenty frames and gradually fade away until they are no longer discernible. They are largest and brightest on the first ten or twenty frames and gradually fade away until they are no longer discernible. Many of the frames, most of them are less bright, less distinct and they appear to be random phenomena, these are indications or disturbances caused by imperfections of the film or the processing.

The analysis of the two objects was carried out by tracing on an overlay celluloid the relative motion of the objects with respect to fixed reference points. As far as the image the azimuth and altitude of the objects were measurable with approximate accuracy.

The Recordak as a film projector similar to a Recordak but equipped with accessories remotely controls the starting and stopping of the film. It was developed by Douglas I. Bopp, and is manufactured and serviced by Geoscec Inc., Los Angeles 69, California.

Also a reprinted 35mm film was analyzed and proved to yield accurate results. However, four frames, viz, 1177 to 1180 were missing in the 35mm reel.

The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page does not contain any photographs, but rather text describing an analysis of "simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances" made by an "aircraft research firm". The text discusses the "striking similarity" of these simulated photographs to "the two white blobs in this film", and states that based on the credibility of this analysis and the supporting evidence, the Air Force has "no compelling reason to alter its original conclusion".

THE CASE
5 or 15 Aug 1950

Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances, made by an aircraft research firm in a recent independent and unsolicited analysis of the --- films, show striking similarity to the two white blobs in this film. 

Based on the degree of credibility accorded this early ATIC evaluation and the strong corroborative evidence supplied by the recent independent analysis, the Air Force has no compelling reason to alter its original conclusion.

Analysis of Photographic Records
-3-                           Serial 01

"The relative indistinctness of the details and separation of the objects to the horizon " are presented in figures 5(a), 5(b), and 6.

The statistical indistinctness (contrast, details and separation) all appear to agree to within the limits of observational errors with an assumption based on the UFO system being held at a constant velocity oscillating motion over the period of their filming.

The angular size of the objects (as similar to those seen in visual observations) lay close to being a small angle a' of 5 degrees or a little less to the horizon over a period varying from 5 to 25 minutes, where the objects presumably remained on a different azimuth heading approaching or leaving the observer (striking and trailing edge trails are included in figures 5(a) and 5(b), along with the observed data (cf. Appendix I for the calculation method)). As mentioned in the Appendix, some random errors exist and the true motion of the objects may still have been somewhat different with a somewhat different velocity than that derived from the simulation, the apparent angular velocity of the objects. However, any such motion would not constitute the confidence of the analysis, although individual and composite proportions may show some variation as the figures show (par. 3).

The inclination to the horizon is found to be very small, the objects appearing to be near the horizon. There is a slight decrease in the angle of inclination as the objects move, but this is small relative to the random errors apparent in the measurements.

Figure 6 indicates there typical parallel terminal headings of the UFO system. The parallax would indicate that the dimensions and fuzziness of the images, figure 6, the measurements of the diameter of the developed images (as seen on the 60 mm film) because of the smallness of the dimension and fuzziness of the images, there seem to be slight fluctuations which can be attributed to a variation in the definition and fuzziness of the images...(some text redacted) constant velocity and size would be closely approximated by a rather simple mathematical function."

The text reads:

Montana Case: * In 1952, after an ATIC interrogation of witnesses and evaluation of data, and our opinion at that was that the UFO's apparently were two F-84 aircraft. In support of this contention, a few weeks ago an extremely able and very detailed analysis was made by a private laboratory of the film strip in question. Their conclusions, in part, were that, "Photographs of the UFO's indicate that airplane reflections might possibly look like the images shown on the film." The fact that the images do fade is reminiscent of airplane reflective phenomena". Also strong corroborative evidence is given by simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances made by this laboratory which show that aircraft can look similar to the two white blobs shown on the Montana films. There is, therefore, no compelling reason to alter our original evaluation.

Unidentified Flying Object Report
Subject interviewed: XXXX XXXX
(Details withheld to protect privacy)
On August 9, 1950, at approximately 2200 hours, XXXX XXXX, a resident of Great Falls, Montana, observed a bright, saucer-shaped object in the sky over his home. The object appeared to hover and maneuver for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing from view. XXXX reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn forwarded the information to Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects.
As part of the investigation, XXXX was interviewed, and the four photographs included in this report were taken during the follow-up inquiry. The photographs depict what appear to be unusual markings or patterns in the landscape, possibly related to the sighting. However, the exact nature and origin of these markings remain unclear and require further analysis.
This case has been classified as an "unresolved" incident in the Project Blue Book archives, and the investigation is ongoing.

On 9 August 1950, at about 1300 hours, local time, the witness, a farmer, observed an unidentified flying object near Great Falls, Montana. 2. The witness reported that he first observed the object as it approached from the southeast. The object appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter and about 10 feet thick. It appeared to be glowing orange or red in color, and was moving at an extremely high rate of speed. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. 3. The witness stated that the object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it disappeared to the northwest. 4. No sound was reported from the object. 5. No other witnesses could be located.

Text from the document:

GREAT FALLS, MONTANA 
9 AUGUST 1950 
AIR FORCE REPORT NO. 10 

WHAT WAS SEEN: 
Witness observed an unidentified object in the sky approximately 5 miles northwest of Great Falls, Montana at approximately 2150 hours on 9 August 1950. The object was described as round, silver in color, and approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It was observed to be hovering and maneuvering at a high rate of speed, suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view. 

INVESTIGATION: 
Investigation revealed that the object was probably a reflection of the tower or other structure caused by the moon shining on the object at the angle the object was observed. No further investigation is warranted.

CONCLUSION: 
The unidentified object observed was probably a reflection of a man-made structure caused by the moon shining on the object.

This image contains a newspaper article from the Dayton Daily News dated October 30, 1950. The article has two main sections: "Field Denies Saucer Report" and "Latest 'Saucer' Story Fails To Hold Water".

The first section discusses a saucer-shaped object that was reported by a resident of Great Falls, Montana. The article states that the Air Force officially denied the report, saying that the object seen was likely the moon or a weather balloon. 

The second section discusses the latest "flying saucer" story, which the article claims has failed to hold water. It mentions that the Air Force has looked into the incident and determined that the object seen was likely a weather balloon.

There does not appear to be any photograph in this particular image.

Field Denies Saucer Report
Air Force officials in Great Falls, Mont. said Monday they could find no evidence to support the report of a saucer-shaped object being seen over that city Sunday night. The object was reportedly sighted by a resident of the city.

Officials said they investigated the incident and found it was likely caused by the moon or a weather balloon. They said they could find no evidence to substantiate the report.

The resident who reported seeing the object said it was saucer-shaped and glowed with a reddish light. He said it appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter and was moving at a high rate of speed.

Officials said they could find no one else who reported seeing the object. They said an intensive investigation was carried out, but they could find no confirmation of the report.

Latest 'Saucer' Story Fails To Hold Water
The nation's latest flying saucer story has failed to hold water.

The Great Falls, Mont. officer who earlier this week was quoted as saying a saucer-shaped object had been sighted over the town, said today the object was probably a weather balloon.

The officer explained the earlier statement which caused interest in Washington, D.C. was based on sketchy information. When the Air Force checked further, it was found the object was a weather balloon.

The film, which during the excitement in Washington was said to show the saucer, also has been found to be of a weather balloon. The Great Falls officer said the film will be returned to the owners who submitted it to the Air Force investigation.

OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

On August 9, 1950. at 1215 hours, the observer. Mrs. Dewey J. Fournier, was in her back yard, 3100 4th Avenue North, Great Falls, Montana, when she noticed a strange object in the sky. 

The object was first sighted at approximately 10 degrees above the northwest horizon. It was traveling in a southeasterly direction and disappeared from view at approximately 60 degrees above the southeast horizon.

The object was observed for a period of approximately 30 to 45 seconds. It appeared to be in the form of a ball of fire, approximately 6 to 8 inches in diameter, and was leaving a long, wide trail behind it. The trail appeared to be whitish in color.

The object was traveling at a terrific rate of speed and made no sound. When first sighted, the object was traveling at an extremely high altitude, but as it progressed southeastward, it appeared to lose altitude. No estimate was made of the actual altitude of the object.

The weather at the time of the observation was clear, with a few scattered clouds in the sky. The wind was from the northwest at approximately 10 mph.

No other witnesses were located who observed the object.

The image appears to be a photograph of a piece of equipment or structure, possibly some kind of industrial tower or framework, with a small object visible in the background, potentially a vehicle or something similar. The photograph has a grainy, black and white quality, which is consistent with it being an older document from the Project Blue Book archives.

GREAT FALLS, MONT.
REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
DATE: 9 AUGUST 1950

On 9 August 1950, the witness, a civilian employee of the Great Falls Air Force Base, observed an unidentified flying object while on duty on the base. The witness reported that the object was circular in shape, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and appeared to be metallic in color. The object was observed to hover and maneuver over the base for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing rapidly from view.

No other details or descriptions are provided in the document. The photograph appears to be included as part of the report, but does not seem to directly depict the UFO sighting described in the text.

It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document that describes a sighting of two bright lights in an echelon formation at Great Falls, Montana on August 15. The text mentions that the objects were made with colored movie films and were featured in a movie titled "Unidentified Flying Objects", which was being shown nationwide on various TV channels at the time.

EXTRACT GEORGE RICHARD STEVENSON

on August 15, baseball park manager captured the sighting, on film, with his movie camera at Great Falls, Montana, of two round bright lights in echelon formation, which moved behind a water tower. These objects were made with colored movie films and appeared in the movie entitled "Unidentified Flying Objects", now being shown nationwide on various TV channels.

The report received three other movies that were considerable attention. One in 3600 frames showed two bright spots of light speeding away without any visible means of propulsion, and another in 3600 frames showed a bright object being observed under telescope examination. But we were not able to come to any definite conclusions.

1. In compliance with your message AFOIN-ATIA-12-10-Z, dated 22 December 1952, Mr. *** W. Marquess, Wing Operations and Training Office, this station.

2. Mr. *** version of the incident is as follows:

On the 5th of August 1950, I, as manager of the Fleetrics, a local baseball team, walked to the grandstand of the local stadium here in Great Falls. Montana. It was approximately 11:30 AM and my purpose was to check the direction of the wind in preparation for the afternoon's game.

Looking toward the smoke stack to see in which direction the wind was blowing, I saw two objects shaped very bright objects completely motionless and in direct line with the smoke stack. I was of the opinion that they were aircraft, but after a few seconds of a still motionless view, I decided that they could not be aircraft maneuvering. I watched them for approximately two to three minutes. At the same time I shouted for my secretary and her husband to look also. At the time I thought there might have been a whistling noise, but of that I am not certain. The two objects then took off at a tremendous rate of speed, much faster than any jet aircraft I have ever seen. They did not take time to return to the exact spot from where I had originally sighted them. I prepared my camera and started taking pictures. From a point immediately adjacent to my car, by the time I had run to my car, The two objects were again motionless, but as I point0d my camera there was again a tremendous burst of speed and they were gone. This was not covering any distance; they were motionless, but an occasional vibration seemed to momentarily lift them after which they would instantly correct their level, plane to their seeming position. The two objects were round and appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter.

OBJECTS are moving at very high speeds. I approximate the speed to have been over 400 MPH. At all times the altitude was definitely in the 50,000 ft. to 70,000 ft. above terrain bracket. The end frames of the movie reel show the objects to be in line with a high degree of precision with a minimum of deviation or wavering. The objects traversed from one side of the screen to the other in a straight line from the spot where I was standing. At the border objects hovered for two or three minutes and then flew out of sight. The clearist films or the movie were forwarded by the Air Force when I first lent them. However, no concrete identification or evaluation as to flight traffic pattern. Sketch #1 shows the point from which the objects were first sighted. Sketch #2 shows the exact spot from where the original sightings were made. The sketch indicates the speed as constant, about 2-1/2 miles of motion in about 5 minutes.

It is reported by hearsay that other individuals observed these objects at the same hour on the same day. However, due to elapsed time since these sightings, no concrete identification of other witnesses.

G.____ is the manager of the project and partially responsible. He has a well-known, courteous individual. He denounced all who claimed to have observed the same objects in the same vicinity on the same day. Particularly referring to two radio stations for Mr. X and Y, and returned sporting casters to their studios. This was undoubtedly resulted in considerable financial loss to them due to the final disavowal of witnesses. The results in the final stages of a lawsuit or criminal courts.

Dear Mr. Rochlen:

This office is in receipt of the extremely able analysis performed on August 1950, and subsequently on August 30, 1950 and inter-
preted as an unidentified flying object photographed by Mr. ----- in the Green-House Studios.

As a result of your report, however, the statement attributed to Mr. ---- that a number of such incidents have reportedly been removed from the file while in the possession of the Air Force is without foundation. In fact, the critical AF review of the data was in damaged condition when returned to us.

We have reviewed, and that the final report was in damaged condition when returned to us, and that the original film and equipment are available for further inspection should it be requested. We can assure you that a frame or two might be lost in the process. Mr. ---- denied permission the followingday showing the local Air Force representative.

We certainly appreciate your sending us your report. The conclusions of which back-up the Air Force's "unidentified" rating on UFOs. The previous release of this report (Analysis of Aerial Object) is approved for any release you deem advisable, that is, all reports and sightings from 1947 to 1955. It includes the official Air Force investigation and special studies of the Air Force, and the analysis of the report by your staff of scientists and experienced pilots to the average man-on-the-street.

The Honorable Donald A. Quarles, Secretary of the Air Force, on the 5th of October 1955 publicly released the summary of the Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14. This summary (your report's equivalent) discloses the continuuing line of investigation from approximately 1/1/53 to 3/1/55. The "unknowns" are, of course, the prime target of continued investigative effort.

Concerning your letter of 25 August 1950 regarding the case of how low this percentage may become. However, we wish to reiterate some of the conclusions of all these studies with regard to the phenomena:

1. There is a total lack of evidence that the phenomena observed are interplanetary or celestial in origin.
2. There is a total lack of evidence that they are interplanetary vehicles.
3. There is a total lack of evidence that they represent technological developments outside the range of present day scientific knowledge.
4. There is a total lack of evidence that they constitute any threat to the security of our country.

We must apologize for the delay in replying to your letter; unfortunately, we did not receive it until the 26th of April.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an outline of procedures executed to obtain the finished product of 8 x 10 glossy paper photographic prints. The text describes the process of using 16mm motion picture Kodachrome film, creating panchromatic cut film negatives, and enlarging these negatives onto 8 x 10 projection printing paper.

The text in the document is as follows:

The following is an outline of the procedures executed to obtain the finished product of 8 x 10 glossy paper photographic prints.

1. Original film was 16 mm motion picture Kodachrome film.

2. This 16 mm Kodachrome film was then processed and printed in a Panchromatic cut film. This Panchromatic cut film was processed by normal methods in Eastman 2-75 developer.

3. These 4 x 5 cut film negatives were then enlarged in a Omega D-2 Enlarger onto 8 x 10 projection printing paper.

The degree of enlargement is all caused by holding constant. Development times for the intermediate negatives and the projection prints are held as constant as possible. The finished prints have a grainy appearance due to the extreme enlargment of the original 16 mm film. The part in the film from which the enlargment is made appears to be the last top of the print which is the image of the motion picture camera used to take the original photographs.

Analysis of Photographic Material

No details can be recognized on the images of the objects, i.e. no structure of any kind, no color fringes, no shapes, even under a high power microscope. (The images are definitely round white dots, except a few which were self-luminous). This is likely as a result of camera motion blur. The sun is known to have been to the left of the objects, as evidenced by shadows on the film.

There is no conclusive evidence that they were self-luminous because at no time were they seen against the prevailing sunlight.

Several additional pertinent pieces of information were learned from Mr. X in telephone conversations on March 17 and March 28, 1955, to wit:

The reverse bearing types employed were equipped with a telephonic lens of 3 1/2 inches in focal length and operated at 16 frames/second. He noticed no surface wind to speak of at the time, presumably due to the meteorological conditions.

An aerial photograph of the ball park showing the grain elevation was obtained, but it was of indifferent quality (Figure 2).

With the knowledge of the focal length and frame spread, the transverse components of the distance and velocity of the objects can be computed to their altitude and distance from the observer (for the objects at the start of filming). Assuming the altitude to be 1,745 the total velocity can be similarly correlated. Since only angular distance from one station are available for measurements, the actual range at any one time cannot be determined.

If the objects' initial distance was_____________, their altitude was _______________, their transverse velocity was ______________, and their total velocity was _______________ (assuming 1,745 heading).

Incidental information presently available comprises the following: Great Falls, Montana is situated on the Upper Missouri River, just east of the Rocky Mountains at latitude 47° 30' and longitude 111° 18'. Altitude is 3,357 feet.

Azimuth and altitude of the sun were computed utilizing references (1) and (2) listed at the end of this report.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Analysis of Photographic Material -6- Serial 01

Jet aircraft based here at that time, so that if any were in the air, they would have been mistaken, this did the photographic examination could not have stated but this explanation is not convincing, the contrast against the blue sky being much greater than could be expected of just exhaust under the film exposure conditions.

The objects left no observable trail and their tracking for 16 seconds was reported insufficient for manipulation. Their brightness, speed, almost precisely rectilinear path, steady motion, and sudden disappearance conditioned with their suppression that they were birds. These same facts together with the weather report also seem to rule out various forms of optical mirage or cloud reflections (IO).

It is apparent that the most possible natural phenomenon which could account for these film effects would be multiple reflections. There are, however, several factors which make such a hypothesis quite strained. First, it is not certain that the camera were in proper or other aircraft flying in formation at this particular time and place. Second, the reflection from the rotating blades might have produced up to 50 images per second, but about twelve objects only were observed. Third, assuming a 175° azimuth heading, the distortion of any mirror or cloud reflection would hardly bear the observed linear and undistorted direction and persistence.

Meteors seldom are visible for more than three seconds (4), (5). Some bright fireballs can be observed up to six seconds but their orbit and angular velocity would no doubt be quite different. Their trails may persist up to 10 seconds (6).

The speeds involved might possibly be compatible with those of birds. Some birds may reach medium speeds of up to 45 to 55 mph. However, it is doubtful if any birds could have flight characteristics as depicted on the film, e.g. if they were to be 3 strokes per second (cf. (9)), a more erratic path with considerable variation in luminosity would undoubtedly have been produced. Any birds could hardly keep such a linear and undistorted course.

All of these paths are directed away from the Air Force Base but might conceivably be a section of a landing pattern. Note that all paths inditially converge close to the observer giving a better opportunity for visual recognition of them as being jet planes.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Analysis of Photographic Material -7- Serial 01

1. The off in the vertical direction from the optimal reflective angle. (This means flight path would have to be standard monoplanar, as no more than 2° or 3° off any portion of the course as observed.) An assumption implicit in this argument is that the objects were at optimal angle of reflection. This condition would not necessarily occur later as no maximum or optimum intensity is observed (just an approximately continuous variation in intensity, cf. figure 6). This figure the objects were first noticed in a sequence at the maximum deviation.

2. Thus 5° represents the smallest angular discrepancy and in all likelihood this discrepancy in the horizontal was greater. The last two facts assume particular importance when it is noted that a typical airplane will reflect only when it is within 1° horizontally and 2° (aim reflection up to 4°) vertically of its optimal angle of reflection. In fact, assuming the objects observed were reflections of real airplanes, the discrepancy in their angle from the view would indicate that they disappeared from view. Fourth, the distance of these hypothetical planes would probably have been over 7 miles (making observable on their very close day visibility 60 miles) they could have been rather easily identified as planes on the film (as is usual on all hignly detailed films). This, however, seems much too large when one considers the size and intensity of the images don't actually portray the real dimension or the reflecting surface (cf. appendix II) but only do give an indication of the reflecting surface of the size. This indication would roughly put the reflecting airplanes between one and three miles distant, which would be consistent with the first conclusion (that the objects were closer than 7 miles).

3. Calculations on the object is equal to the angle of reflection to the observer, the angles being taken with respect to the axis of the aircraft.

These facts are confirmed with respect to the F-94 Jet and DC-6 airplane configurations. The discrepancy in the plane's angle of incidence vertical angle exists discrepancy of vertical rather than horizontal difference such an angle 1° will still produce a reflected image 1/2 the size of the original plane. These reflections are less intense and in the special case can be computed up about 15° from the original angle of reflection. On the other hand, reflections from the fuselage appear to be computed data when this angle is only 2° in the horizontal plane, or appendix II.

At five miles a typical fifty foot airplane subtends angles of 7' by 2'. The resolving power of the eye is from 1' to 3' (1/2) while that of the camera set at F/2.8 is about 1 1/3' (1/3 theoretical resolving power), or figure 1(c), for the film of the airplane reflections. It would appear that the resolution on the resolving power of the ground observer system using silhouettes card furnished by the Air Force to the Ground Observer Corps.

Analysis of Photographic
Material

On the other hand, the photographs shown in Appendix II do seem to indicate definite reflections which look like the images shown on the film. Of course, balloons, shiny insects etc. or for that matter any bright light source in the sky might lead to similar reflections which would stive very much the appearance of the genuine article. The photographs do fade to reminiscent of airplane reflective phenomena, although this in itself would not explain the apparent speed of the Objects as represented in the image. The discrepancy in the azimuth heading for sun reflection might be accounted for by large cross winds (they could nevertheless record the plane's direction by about 5°) but the angular discrepancy still exists and along with the image size, remains a puzzle in the data of the definite reflection hypothesis.

The author acknowledges with regret that, despite the considerable amount of effort spent on the analysis of the evidence and circumstances of the "Montana UFO Case", no definite conclusion could be brought out. The indications as to what the objects may have been must be described as insufficient to explain the evidence and the uncertainty of some of the reports observations remains and will need accounts. Whether a better identification of the recorded phenomenon could have been attained by a more searching investigation on the spot at the time, still remains difficult to assess.

This in itself would eliminate the idea as candidates for the UFO as both circular and far different in appearance from the two UFO's described. We know the landing pattern that the two UFO's had taken, and we know when the two UFO's had been seen.

GREAT FALLS, MONTANA

Subject: UFO Report

1. This letter will serve to report the following unusual aerial sightings which occurred in the Great Falls, Montana area on September 12, 1950. 

2. At approximately 10:15 PM on September 12, 1950, my wife and I observed four bright lights moving in a northwesterly direction at a very high altitude over Great Falls. The lights were very brilliant and seemed to move in a formation of a diamond shape. Their speed was estimated to be around 500 miles per hour. They were in sight for approximately 1 minute before disappearing from view. The lights appeared to be white or silver in color. There was no sound associated with the objects and no trail or exhaust was visible. The sky was clear at the time of the sighting.

3. This report is submitted for your information and appropriate action.

Sincerely,
C. A. SHERIFF

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book document that defines various quantities and variables related to photographic material analysis, such as altitude, distance, time, velocity, azimuth, and angles. The text describes these quantities and provides mathematical formulas for calculating them.

Here is the text from the document:

APPENDIX I

Let us define the following quantities:
A = altitude or the objects above the observer - arbitrary units.
h = altitude of the objects (the midpoint of their line or centers) above the horizon in degrees.
L = distance between the objects - arbitrary units.
R = distance of the objects from the observer - arbitrary units.  
T = time measured after initial observation in seconds.
V = velocity of the objects - arbitrary units.
α = azimuth or line of sight between the observer and center point of the objects.
β = angle between the line or centers of the objects and their direction of motion.
δ = angle between the perpendicular to the line of sight and the objects' path.
Λ = azimuth or direction of the object's path (heading).
Θ = angle between the initial line of sight and the line of sight at time T in radians or degrees.
ε = angle subtended by the apparent separation of the two objects - radians.

The zero subscript refers to the value of the quantity at the time of initial observation. Those that indicate the initial separation and azimuth since background objects (by which the initial azimuth may be referenced) do not appear until frame 165.

Let us assume β, δ, Λ, and ε to remain constant during the entire period of observation. We derive this constant value by a zero subscript.

For simplicity we define the following dimensionless quantities.

r = R/Ro 
co = Ao/Ro
t = Vo/Ro
lo = Io/Ro
Consideration of figure 7 and application of the law of cosines together with trigonometric manipulation yields:
tan h = tan ho / (1 + 2t sin bo + t^2)^1/2  (1)
cos β = (1 + t sin bo) / (1 + 2t sin bo + t^2)^1/2  (2)
ωo = (1 + 2t sin bo + t^2) / (1 + t sin bo)  (3)
In the example at hand, the total elapsed time of observation is on the order of 15 seconds and the angular sweep of the objects across the sky (β) is about 20°. Thus
0 < t < 0.3
Using equations (1), (2) and (3) the dashed lines depicting theoretical azimuth headings (figure 5a and 5b) are computed.
There does exist a random error (attributed to errors in measurement or slight variations of the UFO's motion) about the theoretical line that makes it impossible to determine a precise plot and establish plot and establish a detailed pattern. Furthermore, since the angular sweep and the visual observations are over a relatively short interval, the normal points could at most mask a variation in distance, altitude or separation of the two. In particular, there is a slight variation in both plots (figures 1:25 to 175) towards the 169° azimuth heading. However, the general accuracy of the pointing to maintain the same angular direction on the plot indicates that this slight variation doesn't represent a variation in direction, but rather represents a variation in distance, possibly a variation in the targets to the curve's would lie somewhere between 169° and 173° azimuth heading.

No plate (or rather frame) distortion correction formula has been
applied to the UFO's coordinates as measured directly from the film.
It is assumed that since the objects are near the center of the frame for
most of the shots, the error due to distortion or emulsion shrinkage etc.
would be much less than when the standard deviation of 45" and therefore would
not affect the reliability of the measurements.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document that provides an analysis of photographic material. The document discusses various details about the analysis, including the image of a "brilliant light source" as seen by either the eye or a camera, the size of the image, and reflections observed. The text also mentions details about the photographic experiment, including the use of a chrome plated model and a cylindrical reflector. The document provides an in-depth analysis of the photographic evidence and measurements taken.

Analysis of Photographic Material

APPENDIX II

The image of any brilliant light source as seen by either the eye or a camera appears much larger than the luminous object. An extreme example of this is the image of the sun which subtends an angle of about 1/2 degree when viewed with the naked eye. The image seen in a plane mirror at 100 feet reflecting the sun's disc is exaggerated some 15 times. This fact has obvious bearing on the analysis of UFO films. It therefore militates a photogrammetric experiment conducted by the author on December 10, 11, 1955. The experiment was devised to obtain definitive information relative to the analysis of various small bright sources or reflected sunlight (cf. figure 8(b)).

Our hundred and ninety millimeter cylindrical reflections of the images of various small bright sources were examined. The tests included stills, as well as 16 mm and 8 mm movie pictures and shots of various artificial reflections also were taken.

The most pertinent facts gleaned from this experiment involved the analysis of original specular sun reflection (see figure 8(c)) and a bright cylindrical reflector (cf. figure 8(a)). the author then shows these objects as magnification in the glass of the DC-6 photographic enlargement. It is stated that the DC-6 model photographed from a distance that would give the same image size picture as the full scale original from about three miles; the bright images are of dimension corresponding to 0.004 x 0.002 radians. Figure 9(a) shows reflections at 50 foot airplane in geometry to a fifty-foot airplane at a distance of about two miles; the dimensions at this smaller distance were 0.024 x 0.014 radians. Figure 9(b) shows the image at altitude was 0.004 radians. The UFO image intensity appears to be slightly less than that of the 50 foot jet, and techniques would not allow quantitative analysis in this regard. Figure 9(c) shows a distant sun reflection indicating four times brighter than the UFO image, which was not allowed quantitative analysis due to limitations for identifying the characteristics. The reflection from these jets lasted about 55 seconds; the 50(a) shows cylindrical reflections from a commercial plane (100 feet) is a landing pattern over the Los Angeles International Airport. Its estimated diameter was 0.0003 radians. (The reflection in this case lasted about 100.)

Unfortunately there is no photograph or image present in the provided document. The text appears to be an "Analysis of Photographic Material" discussing the effects that can cause distortion in UFO photographs, such as atmospheric conditions, camera lens, and exposure. The document seems to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report, analyzing photographic evidence of UFOs. I have transcribed the full text from the document below:

Analysis of Photographic Material

In order to compare the UFO frames with a typical fifty foot airplane, silhouettes are included in figure 10(c). Figure 10(c) shows the UFO's just before they fade from view.

The experimental results appear to indicate that if the first few frames of the UFO film show our reflection from airplanes which are capable the angle and distance as observed, then it is still possible the UFO is not quite optimally oriented so the planes could have not quite optimally oriented so the planes could have been at closer distance.

Airplane reflections have been observed both photographically and visually so positive (focal smaller distance from side-in to fade-out) over angular travel ranges less than 20° (to moon diameters). This conclusion was borne out by manipulation (U-6 and P-92) in sunlight.

The effects which accounted for the distortion in image size may be listed as follows: scattering in the atmosphere (between the light source and the camera), optical refraction (dome, stigmatism, distortion), flaring at the lens surfaces, diffraction, vignetting in the film (continued), degradation of the image (possibly due to film swelling or chemical reaction between over-exposed and under-exposed areas usually produce flirings called Notike) and sharpedge effects. There are also distortions produced during development and reprinting. An excellent description and analysis of all of the above effects is contained in a reference (11).

All of these effects will cause, to a greater or lesser degree, the image on the film to appear larger than the source. The stronger the light source, the more prominent these effects become. Curved "reflecting" surfaces have the property of not seeming to be precisely oriented with respect to the sun's rays. This can lead to bright image formation. This bundling effect also accounts for the anomaly that there is also quite a difference between specular gun reflections from film, glass, wings and airless planes and those from the clouds. The first are more nearly planar surfaces and therefore produce more intense reflections. Very slight changes in orientation with respect to the sun can completely destroy the reflections. Past experience (9) indicates that a "bull's eye" curvature and the law of reflection can practically destroy the reflections but can also at times produce from 5° to 100% in the horizontal plane and sometimes up to 45° in the vertical plane.

Light sources brilliant enough to produce this form of large scale fogging effects (reflecting interferences diffraction fringing) due to produce noticeable differences in appearance of the size, shape and perspective of the image. These differences are due to diffraction through the polygonal iris of the camera. This broadening is often called "Veiling", cf. reference (13), p. 69.

Attenuation of the light (e.g. associated with scattering, etc.) will tend to decrease many of the sources of fogging; however.

Serial 01

Because of the above described effects, the proportions of bright objects seen from a distance may also be distorted (cf. figure 9(a) where a cylinder of light is made to appear almost like a circular dot). In spite of this, fuzziness of edge definition from planes appears to be a general characteristic of these films as there is evidence of a long continuation hazy effect from the edges of objects. In the case of the Montana films (the subject's line of motion being parallel to the line of sight) the image that appears uniform white dots cannot serve as a valid deterrent to an airplane reflection hypothesis. However, this perhaps leads one to think that the object would have to be even closer than three miles. In Figure 9(c) the jet plane motion made an angle of only about 30° to 60° with the observer's line of sight and the image definitely appears oval.

Examination of figures 10(b) and 10(c) would indicate that airplanes as close as this would certainly appear on the film.

SUBJECT: UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT

1. On 5 October 1950, Mr. advised that the camera used by him in the taking of the moving picture film transmitted under separate cover, was a Revere, 16 mm. magazine loading type with an f/1.9 Wollensak wide-angle lens. Mr. further stated that the film was taken under focal setting, infinity, and the type was Eastman Super X which pictures were taken at sixteen frames per second. Mr. further advised that in operating the camera, he had "panned" the camera slowly from right to left.

2. A further check on the operations of Base Operations, Great Falls Air Force Base, Great Falls, Montana, indicates that an F-51 type aircraft, P-51's, and F-84 type aircraft, #5024, landed at Great Falls Air Force Base at 1132 and 1130 hours (Mountain Standard Time) respectively on 15 August 1950. There were no aircraft from Alaskan Mr. stated that almost immediately after taking the motion pictures, he saw USAF jet type aircraft flow across the sky east of him, heading in a southerly direction.

WITH REGARD TO YOUR COMMENTS ON THE GREAT FALLS, MONT: INCIDENT, THIS MATTER WOULD BE HANDLED BY THE PERSONNEL AT YOUR HEADQUARTERS AS THOS MATTERS PERTAINING TO UFO'S ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AIR FORCE AND ITS PROJECT BLUE BOOK. THE REPORT INDICATES THAT NO JET AIRCRAFT WERE INVOLVED IN THE SIGHTING NOR WERE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN. THE SIGHTING WAS REPORTED USING TWO JET AIRCRAFT MAKING VARIOUS MANEUVERS, HOWEVER, NO PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE WAS OBTAINED. THE FACT THAT THESE AIRCRAFT MERELY APPEARED TO BE CIRCLING IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA DURING OR IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING, DOES NOT NECESSARILY INDICATE A CONNECTION WITH THE INCIDENT. THAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY IS VERY COMMON AND PROBABLE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

DEAR MR. KENNEDY:

THIS WILL APPLY TO YOUR QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA BY MR. ROBERT B. WESTFORD, GREAT FALLS, MONTANA, ON 12 AUGUST 1950. I UNDERSTAND FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THAT THIS CASE WAS PROCESSED AND REFERRED TO YOU FOR CONSIDERATION.

(1) THIS CASE CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE AIR FORCE BY A LETTER FROM THE GREAT FALLS LEADER, GREAT FALLS, MONTANA DATED SEPTEMBER 1950. 

(2) MR. WESTFORD WAS INTERVIEWED BY AN OFFICER FROM A NEARBY AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION. INFORMATION WAS SUBMITTED BY HIM VOLUNTARILY.

(3) ON 12 AUGUST 1950, STARTING ABOUT 2230 HOURS, MR. WESTFORD OBSERVED TWO STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY. HE WATCHED THEM FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES, CONCLUDING THAT THEY WERE NOT AIRCRAFT, SINCE THEIR FLIGHT PATH AND CHARACTERISTICS DIFFERED FROM THOSE OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS LAST TIME MENTIONED WAS OBTAINED FROM A NARRATIVE STATEMENT PREPARED BY MR. WESTFORD, WHICH IS NOT A DIRECT QUESTION OF STANDARD OBSERVATION FORM.

(4) NO PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE OBJECTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION.

(5) CONCLUSION AS TO PROBABLE CAUSE OF SIGHTING IN THIS CASE IS: UNKNOWN.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memorandum from the Director of Intelligence dated June 1, 1956, discussing two UFO sightings described in recently released movies.

The memorandum states the following:

a. The Great Falls, Montana - 1950 case: The Air Force's original conclusion, based on the interpretation of witness testimony, was that the UFOs were, with all probability, two Air Force F-94 fighter aircraft known to be in the vicinity at the time. Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances were made by an aircraft manufacturing firm in a recent independent and unsolicited analysis of the film, showing striking similarities to the two white blips in this film.

b. The - Utah - 1952 case: The original film was analyzed by an Air Force Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory shortly after the sighting. The conclusion reached was that a bright spot of light appearing on the film was caused by seagulls soaring in thermal air currents. The credibility of this conclusion was undoubtedly supported by the presence of identifiable seagulls in some of the frames.

This conclusion was further strengthened by movies of seagulls taken at various distances, which showed them as bright spots of light similar to those in the film.

Memo to D/I (GIN-X), (U) UFO Movie, 1 Jun 56

A recent analysis of the ********* film, made by Air Force photo specialists totally unaware of the previous history of this case, yielded the opinion that the bright spots of light on the film were bird reflections in the strong sunlight.

The unusuality of certain air actions presented in all evaluations made in this case leaves little doubt that the UFOs in the ********* film are genuine.

So there are no flying saucers," the pilots were told. "Where they come from and Where they are going we do not know." This was said by Captain Thomas F. Mantell, according to the USAF report, when he saw the strange object over which he was attempting to gain altitude. Over 100 witnesses, including Air Force personnel, saw the brilliant maneuverable objects our air force states were not aircraft now known. This explains the breathless content of the film.
This is an excerpt of a case of "unidentified flying objects" observed by trained observers. We cannot say positively what they were. Objects our air forces states were not aircraft now known, and the breathless content of the film suggests these were unusual aerial devices.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memorandum from the Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

12 February 1959

MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT DEPUTY, SCIENCE AND COMPONENTS  

SUBJECT: UFO FILM  

1. The film "UFO" referenced in the attached letter was produced by the Green-Rouse Studios and released in 1956. Major Dewey Fournet, Jr., Case Officer Special Photographic Lab, Air Force Photo Group all were hired as technical advisers, but none had connection with the facts in any official capacity as the entire matter was handled informally as the film's producers took part.

2. The film of cases incorporated as a part of this picture was obtained from the original sources. (The "Madden Case") was not a part of this film. (The Air Force had no connection with the release of this film.)

3. A short summary of the two cases follows:  

Case
Time - 1130
Date - 15 August 1950
Place - Great Falls, Montana

A civilian and his secretary were out to inspect a bell which they could not move. This also led to a sighting of the objects with his reverse burret type 16MM camera.

The objects in this case were analyzed on a 7x7 gray-scale similarity analysis to the known air force film analysis. The sightings were found to be in the area at the time, filmulated, and unmistakable analysis was strikingly similar to the air force film.

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a typed document with text describing an observation made by the witness near Tremonton, Utah on July 2, 1952.

Time = 11:10
Date - 2 July 1952
Place - Tremonton, Utah

The document states that the witness and his wife were driving just outside of Tremonton, Utah when they sighted 10 to 12 objects in the sky which they could not identify. The document mentions that the objects were "initially seen as a Bell and Howell automatic camera with 3 telescopic lenses." The document indicates that the film of this observation was sent to the Photographic Interpretation Laboratory of the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for analysis, as pictures of soaring seagulls.

The image does not contain any photographs. The text in the document states:

The well-known Montana movies of which there has also been a great deal of controversy.

The Montana movies were probably P-94 starfighters which were in the area at the time of the sighting. These airplanes were of supersonic flight and have reliable or afterburner capability.

The Montana films depicted probable P-94 starfighter aircraft with superaerodynamic functioning and moving at supersonic speeds. There were individuated (many equipped) interceptors in the area at the time of the incident.
