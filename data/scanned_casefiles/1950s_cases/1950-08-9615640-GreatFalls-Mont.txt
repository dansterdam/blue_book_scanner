VIA AIR MAIL

Mr. [redacted]
Great Falls, Montana

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

You are probably aware of the fact that the Air Force is still continuing the investigation and analysis of "flying saucers". We are presently attempting to make a comparative analysis of recent sightings against those made a previous years. In this connection, the report of a sighting made by you on 15 August 1950 has aroused our interest. Unfortunately, however, our duplicate book of these objects has been inadvertently misplaced.

Therefore, we would be most grateful if you would permit us to borrow your original movies for study and duplication. In so doing you would be rendering us a great service.

We will have an officer from Great Falls Air Force Base contact you about 22 October and, should you consider our request favorable, be will obtain the movies and give you a receipt for them. We will then return them as soon as possible thereafter.

Your cooperation and consideration in this matter is earnestly solicited!

Sincerely,

WILLIAM A. ADAMS

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

We wish to express our sincere appreciation for the assistance which you extended us in connection with your movies. We had duplicate copies made, but these will be used for official purposes only, of course.

Instead of mailing the film at the torn point, as discussed with you previously, it was remitted with celluloid tape. This permitted satisfactory study and duplication without the loss of any frames. However, we recommend against running it in this condition too often, especially at fast projector speeds, since the patch will eventually fray and may result in additional damage. We suggest instead that you make a permanent splice as soon as possible.

The movies constitute a definite contribution to our current analysis. In as immensely far as we can say further comments about them until such time as exhaustive analysis provides us with the basis for some definite conclusions, if any is possible.

Again we tender our sincere thanks for your cooperation and hope that the film's absence has not caused you any hardship.

Sincerely,

Dear General Watson:

Enclosed is a report of an analysis of the "Montana" film of Unidentified Flying Objects photographed by Nicholas Marina in August 1950. This report was prepared by the Douglas Aircraft Company's Missiles Engineering Department Research Section, incidental to a study of publications dealing with unconventional propulsion schemes, under the direction of Dr. W. B. Klemperer. It is being submitted for your perusal in case it might be of interest to you in connection with Project Blue Book as a supplement to such information as has already been compiled. The film and necessary information for this analysis were furnished by the Green-Rouse Studios who will soon release a documentary film on UFO's.

Green-Rouse Studios have requested that copies of the present report be made available to them by April 22, 1956. If your command has no objection to the release of our analysis or sections thereof, we are quite willing, in view of their full cooperation, that they have the desired copies. It would be greatly appreciated if your approval or disapproval of the release of the material to them be sent to us prior to April 22, if necessary by telephone or by teletype.

Sincerely,

DEPT.     1950   OFF THE COAST OF KOREA     LORENZEN OF 191     & WITNESSES 00

VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING, THREE FIGHTER-BOMBERS TOOK OFF FROM THE LIGHT-DECK OF A U.S.S. AIRCRAFT CARRIER. THE SUN HADN-T RISEN AND THERE WAS A 02
LIGHT IN THE AIR. TWO MEN -- A PILOT AND A RADAR GUNNER -- OCCUPIED EACH OF 03
THREE PLANES ASSIGNED TO A ROUTINE MISSION, BOMBING AND STRAFING A TRUCK 04
CONVOY THAT COMBAT INTELLIGENCE EXPECTED TO BE WINDING ALONG THE FLOOR OF A 05
VALLEY ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES FROM THE YALU RIVER. THE TAKEOFF WAS ROUTINE, AS 06
THE FLIGHT TO THE TARGET AREA. AT ABOUT 7 A.M., JUST AS THE SUN WAS 07
BREAKING ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS IN THE EAST. THE AIRCRAFT WERE PROCEEDING NORTH 08
EN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR. RADAR OBSERVERS HAD THEIR EYES 09
PEELED FOR THE TARGET. 10

*I WAS WATCHING THE GROUND BELOW FOR THE CONVOY*, REPORTED ........ *AND 11
AS STARTLED TO SEE TWO LARGE CIRCULAR SHADOWS COMING ALONG THE GROUND FROM 12
NORTHWEST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. WE WERE FLYING NORTH ABOVE A VALLEY WHICH 13
WAS SURROUNDED ON THE EAST AND WEST BY MOUNTAINS. WITH A PASS DIRECTLY AHEAD 14
IF US TO THE NORTH. WHEN I SAW THE SHADOWS I LOOKED UP AND SAW THE OBJECTS 15
WHICH WERE CAUSING THEM. THEY WERE HUGE. I KNEW IAS SOA IS I LOOKED AT 16
MY RADAR SCREEN. THEY WERE ALSO GOING AT A GOOD CLIP -- ABOUT 1000 OR 1200 17
MILES PER HOUR. MY RADAR DISPLAY INDICATED ONE AND A HALF MILES BETWEEN THE 18

OBJECTS, AND OUR PLANES WHEN THE OBJECTS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO HALT, BACK UP AND 19
BEGIN A #JITTERING* OR *#BRILLIANG MOTION.* MY FIRST REACTION, OF 20
COURSE, WAS TO SHOOT. I READIED MY GUNS, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY READIED THE GUN 21
CAMERAS. WHEN I READIED THE GUNS, HOWEVER, THE RADAR WENT HAYWIRE. THE 22
SCREEN *SILHOUETTED* AND BECAME VERY BRIGHT. IT TRIED TO REDUCE THE BRIGHTNESS 23
BY TURNING DOWN THE SENSITIVITY, BUT THIS HAD NO EFFECT. I REALIZED MY RADAR 24
HAD BEEN JAMMED AND WAS USELESS. I THEN CALLED THE CARRIER, USING THE CODE 25
NAME. I SAID THE CODE NAME TWICE, AND MY RECEIVER WAS OUT -- BLOCKED BY A 26
STRANGE BUZZING NOISE. I TRIED TWO OTHER FREQUENCIES, BUT COULDN'T GET 27
*THROUGH. EACH TIME I SWITCHED FREQUENCIES THE BAND WAS CLEAR FOR A MOMENT, 28
THEN THE BUZZING BEGAN. 29

*WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON THE OBJECTS WERE STILL JITTERING OUT THERE AHEAD 30
OF US, MAINTAINING OUR SPEED. ABOUT THE TIME I GAVE UP TRYING TO RADIO THE 31
CARRIER, THE THINGS BEGAN MANEUVERING AROUND OUR PLANES, CIRCLING ABOVE AND 32
BELOW. I GOT A GOOD LOOK AT THEM. I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THEM 33
BEFORE, AND I LEARNED AFTER WE REACHED OUR CARRIER THAT THE OTHER MEN IN THAT 34
FLIGHT HAD THE SAME OPINION. THEY WERE HUGE, BEFORE MY RADAR SET WAS PUT 35
OUT OF COMMISSION, I USED THE INDICATED RANGE PLUS POINTS OF REFERENCE ON THE 36
CANOPY TO DETERMINE THEIR SIZE. THEY WERE AT LEAST 600 OR POSSIBLY 700 FEET 37
IN DIAMETER. 38

*THE OBJECTS HAD A **SILVERED MIRROR** APPEARANCE, WITH A REDDISH GLOW 39
SURROUNDING THEM. THEY WERE SHAPED SOMEWHAT LIKE A COAL -- A HAT, WITH OBLONG 40
PORTS FROM WHICH EMANATED A COPPER-GREEN COLORED LIGHT WHICH GRADUALLY SHIFTED 41
TO PALE PASTEL-COLORED LIGHTS AND BACK TO THE COPPER-GREEN AGAIN. ABOVE THE 42
PORTS WAS A SHIMMERING RED, RING WITH CIRCLED THE TOP PORTION. 43

*WHEN THE THINGS MANEUVERED ABOVE US, WE SAW THE BOTTOMS OF THEM. IN THE 44
MIDDLE OF THE UNDERSIDE WAS A CIRCULAR AREA, COAL BLACK AND NON-REFLECTIVE. 45
IT WAS SIMPLY INKY BLACK, AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE 46
OBJECT **JITTERED** WHILE MANEUVERING, THE BLACK CIRCULAR PORTION ON THE 47
BOTTOM WAS STEADY AND SHOWED NO INDICATION OF MOVEMENT.** 48

WHEN THE OBJECTS SEEMINGLY FINISHED THEIR INSPECTION OF THE NAVY PLANES, 49
THEY TOOK OFF IN THE SAME DIRECTION FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME, AND DISAPPEARED 50
AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. 51

1. Transmitted under separate cover is approximately fifteen feet of moving picture film taken by Mr. [redacted] of 2919 First Avenue North, Great Falls, Montana, who is general manager of the Great Falls Baseball Club.

2. Mr. [redacted] made these pictures on 15 August 1950 between the hours of 11:25 and 11:30 a.m. at Great Falls, Montana. On interview, he stated that he had sighted objects which he was unable to understand at the ball park located at 26th Street and Eleventh Avenue North, Great Falls, Montana, and that he saw two bright disc shaped objects proceeding in a southerly direction at an altitude of approximately ten thousand feet and at a distance of about three-quarters of a mile in a westerly direction from the observer's viewpoint. [redacted] when asked how he obtained his camera and made the pictures to his car from which he obtained his camera and outside the park, stated that he ran downstairs and outside the park. From the time of first sighting to the completion of taking the pictures, he estimated approximately twenty seconds.

3. The water tower in instant pictures is located approximately seven hundred feet in a southwesterly direction from the point at which Mr. [redacted] stood when taking the pictures and the tower is approximately one hundred seventy-five feet in height.

THE [REDACTED] CASE

5 or 15 Aug 1950

Two Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) were sighted and photographed at about 11:30 MST on August 15, 1950 by [REDACTED] Great Falls, Montana. Mr. [REDACTED] owns and operates a radio station in Missoula, Montana, and is the owner of the Great Falls baseball team. It was during an inspection of this ball park that the sighting took place.

[REDACTED] (and his secretary, also present at the time) first noticed the UFO's as silvery objects to the NW, accidentally when looking to tell the wind by the smoke from the Anaconda Copper Comp. smokestack nearby.

The UFO's drew his attention to the extent that he ran 60 feet from the grandstand to the parking lot, got his motion picture camera (Revere turret type 16mm) out of his car and began tracking the UFO's which appeared to him to have stopped in mid-air, remained stationary for a while and then, with a swooshing sound floated away to the left (SW keeping about the same distance from each other until they were lost from sight.

The color film (Daylight Kodachrome) was submitted to the Air Force, it was studied and analyzed by the Air Force and the U.S. Navy.

The original Air Force conclusion, based on the interrogation of witnesses and the evaluation of the data, was that the UFOs were, in all probability, two Air Force F-94 fighter aircraft known to be in the vicinity at the time.

Analysis of Photographic Material                                   Serial 01

PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE "MONTANA" FILM TRACKING TWO UFO'S

Two Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) were sighted and photographed at about 11:30 AM MST on August 15, 1950 by [redacted] at Great Falls, Montana. [redacted] and operates a [redacted] in Missouri, Montana and is the owner of the [redacted] (and his secretary also present at the time). First noting the UFO's as silvery objects to the NW, accidentally while looking to tell the wind by the smoke from the Anaconda Copper Company smokestack nearby. The UFO's drew his attention to the extent that he ran 50 feet from the grandstand to the parking lot, got his motion picture camera (Revere turret type 16mm) out of his car and began tracking the UFO's which appeared to him to have stopped in mid-air, remained stationary for a while and then, with a crosshair screen, located to the left (SW) keeping about the same distance from each other until they were lost from sight, cf. Figure 1, a survey of the area near the ball park, and Figure 2, a photograph of the ball park.

The color film (Daylight Kodachrome) after processing, was submitted by Mariman to USAF-ATIC. It was studied and analyzed there and also by the U.S. Navy. No information concerning their findings was released, but [redacted] Chop (now with DAC Public Relations) recalls that the analysis was considered inconclusive, except that according to Capt. Edward Pappelt, then head of ATIC Project "Bluebook", it was felt that the objects on the film could not have been balloons. The captain recalled that the government first examined the film in 1950, then returned it to [redacted], again borrowed it in 1952, returning it to him later.

Mr. [redacted] claims that the Kodachrome original, as returned to him from the Eastman Kodak Processing Laboratory, comprised 315 frames. This original film was shown by him before several service clubs and other audiences in Montana. Recalls that the first 30-odd frames showed larger images of the UFO's with a notch or band at one point on the periphery of the objects by which they could be seen to rotate in unison while on the [redacted] of the film the objects show up only as unattributed bright white dots.

The first 35 frames removal by the Air Force, according to [redacted], had the film returned by the first 35 frames removal and only the remainder of the film was returned. He says that he has a letter in his files admitting this removal and that the [redacted] part was lost. (Pertinent ATIC records consulted on July 6, 1955, however, contain no evidence or admission that any part was removed or lost.)

Eventually, the film came into the possession of Green-Rouse Productions, at Sam Goldwyn Studios, 1041 North Formosa Street, Hollywood, from which a 16mm and later a 35mm reprint of it were borrowed for examination and analysis. Data Reduction Department was recommended by ATIC personnel in 1950 but not actually carried out.

Analysis of Photographic Material                -2-                Serial 01

Visual study of the reprints, in both cinema projection and frame-by-frame examination on a Recordak, an Iconolog * and a traveling microscope + revealed the following: The reprinted part of the Alma film comprises about 280 frames. ** The first few frames had been torn from the rest in the original but apparently were spliced correctly for the reprinting. On many of the frames two bright white round dots stand out against the dark blue background. They are largest and brightest on the first ten or twenty frames and gradually fade away until they can no longer be definitely made out beyond frame #225. Although there are numerous other dots, spots, and specks on many of the frames, most of them are less bright, less distinct and they appear at random; presumably they are blemishes caused by imperfections of the film or the processing. Against them the two UFO images are quite conspicuous and readily distinguished by their almost constant relative orientation and sharpness as well as by their steady movement across the landscape.

The analysis of the trajectory of the two objects was carried out by tracing on an overlay vellum the relative motion of the objects with respect to fixed reference points, as far as such are visible, viz. from frame #65 to #55. The first 64 frames show no background but sky and horizontal power wires. Beginning with frame #65, what looks like a ventilator duct on the roof of a concrete grain elevator comes into view; after frame #144 the structure of a water tower appears across the foreground, and finally the roof of a second grain elevator on the other side of the water tower enters the picture. These frames indicate the camera was in focus. Figure 3 is a complete tracing of these combined landmark together with the successive positions of the two UFO's. This figure is drawn like a panorama on the assumption that the photographer kept his base without moving appreciably (which was reported by him and is well borne out by the consistency of the perspective). Apparent motion of the objects, under these conditions, is then interpreted in terms of singular velocity of tracking. A similar overlay using the 35mm film was utilized in preparation of Figure 5(a).

The Montana film contains six independent pieces of information (as functioned of time) which describe the UFO images, i.e. the two degrees of freedom of each act (as depicted on two-dimensional film) and the apparent diameter of the developed image of each. In the analysis it was convenient to treat the UFO's as a system. Thus we chose as the four degrees of freedom of this system the azimuth and altitude of the mid-point on the line

THE [REDACTED] CASE
5 or 15 Aug 1950

Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances, made by an aircraft research firm in a recent independent and unsolicited analysis of the [redacted] films, show striking similarity to the two white blops in this film.

Based on the degree of credibility accorded this early ATIC evaluation and the strong corroborative evidence supplied by the recent independent analysis, the Air Force has no compelling reason to alter its original conclusion.

of centers between the images, their separation distance and their inclination to the horizon. All of the quantities, except for the inclination to the horizon * are presented in figures 5(a), 5(b), and 6.

The three independent quantities (azimuth, altitude and separation) all appear to agree to within the limits of observational errors with an assumption that the UFO system held an essentially fixed configuration and executed a constant velocity rectilinear motion over the period of their filming (15 seconds). The angular (azimuth) velocity is found to be 0.01° radians per second and the azimuth heading of the apparent course is 170° (making an angle of 550 from the line of sight to the water tower). Theoretical surveys depicting the appearance of the object's motion if they were on different azimuth headings are included in Figures 5(a) and 5(b), along with the observed data (cf. Appendix I for the calculation methods).

As mentioned in the Appendix, some random errors exist and the true motion of the objects may well have been a gently sweeping curve with tangents bracketed between 1590 and 1730. Of course, we cannot rule out some other curvilinear motion of the objects. However, any such motion would necessitate the coincidence of azimuth, altitude and separation -- all varying proportionally and "geared" together (to a certain tolerance of 1° and altitude and separation of +5°). In any event, we shall adopt the hypothesis of nearly rectilinear fixed configuration motion as a basis for some of the following analysis, our only justification being that this is the simplest hypothesis and that, in the brief period of the filming, any gentle curvilinear trajectory could well be approximated by a straight line, e.g. Figure 4 for a map of Great Falls on which has been sketched possible UFO paths.

Measurements of the diameter of the developed images were also made. They were less accurate (~0.01mm on the 16mm film) because of the smallness of the dimension and fuzziness of the images, figure 6. The measurements do confirm that the dots dwindle in size (and the objects finally completely disappear from view). There seems to be slight fluctuations in the luminosity of the objects. A somewhat detailed discussion of the degree to which these dots do or do not represent the objects photographed inclusive of their directions and the photographic process is presented in appendix II. Some pertinent photographic experiments made in this regard are also analyzed and the results reported there.

In any event it is obvious that these small images do not exactly represent the objects photographed. One can conclude, from the fact that these images are completely gray, that (unless the regressive component to their motion been grossly underestimated) the objects were not isotropic point luminosity radiators (such radiators would be closely approximated by a ball or a silver sphere shining by reflected sunlight.)

The inclination to the horizon is found to be very small, the objects appearing to move almost in a plane parallel to the earth's surface. There is a slight decrease in the angle of inclination as the objects progress, but its small value is almost masked by the random errors inherent in the measurements.

Figure 4 indicates three typical parallel azimuth headings of the 170° system, any parallel 16° total to 16° source of possible parallax, without parallax no valid estimation of distance can be made.

Montana Case:

In 1950, after an ATIC interrogation of witnesses and evaluation of data, and our opinion at that was that the UFO's apparently were two F-94 aircraft. In support of this contention, a few weeks ago an extremely able and very detailed analysis was made by a private laboratory of the film strip in question. Their conclusions, in part, were that, "photographs of the UFO's indicate that airplane reflections might possibly look like the images shown on the film. The fact that the images do fade is reminiscent of airplane reflective phenomena". Also strong corroborative evidence is given by simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances made by this laboratory which show that aircraft can look similar to the two white blops shown on the Montana films. There is, therefore, no compelling reason to alter our original evaluation

Air Materiel Command officials
at the Wright-Patterson AFB
Thursday denied a report that they
had a confidential colored motion picture of two silver discs flying over
Great Falls, Mont., last August.
"We do not have any such

The report of the confidential
came from Nick Mariana, manager of the Great Falls baseball
team.

MARIANA TOLD the Associated
Press that he and his flying field
crew had filmed on Aug. 15, footage of two silver discs that disappeared from sight. He said they appeared in the film for about three
seconds. The films were turned
over to an AMC (Air Materiel Command) investigator. He said he was told to
release nothing further concerning
the film.

The team manager said the
objects appeared to be about 100 feet high and were in sight
for about 15 seconds.

"They were living out of the
north and came southeasterly,"
he said. "They rose up and then
disappeared from sight. They
looked round and silvery and were
moving together - not too fast."

Air Materiel Command officials at the Wright-Patterson
AFB said the film of flying
pictures taken last Aug. 15 at a
Great Falls, Mont., ball park
said the film was too dark to
distinguish any recognizable objects.

The film, which during the
past week had become the subject of widespread conjecture,
will not be sent on to USAF

if he wanted it, will be returned to
Nick Mariana, manager of the
Great Falls baseball team.

The Great Falls officer forwarded the film to AMC intelligence officials last Friday. The
films arrived at the Wright-Patterson base late Monday evening
and were viewed immediately.

After viewing the films the
AMC officials issued the following statement:

"The film is too dark to allow definite interpretation of its contents. For this reason it will not
be sent on to Washington headquarters. The Air Force has no
further interest in the film."

August 15, baseball park manager, [redacted], captured the saucers on film, with his movie at Great Falls, Montana of two round bright lights in echelon formation, which moved behind a water tower. These objects were made with colored movie films and appeared in the movie entitled"Unidentified Flying Objects", now being shown nationwide on various TV channels.

The project received three other movies that got considerable attention. One, in color, was taken at Great Falls, Mont., and showed two bright spots of light speeding across the sky and passing behind a water tower. Two lights in the sky and the lights could have been reflections of the sun on the jets, but were not able to come to any definite conclusions.

        Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. In compliance with your message AFOIN-ATIA-12-10-2, dated
22 December 1952, Mr. [redacted] was interrogated by Lt. Peter
Marques, Wing Operations and Training Office, this station.

2. Mr. [redacted] version of the incident is as follows:

On about the 5th or 15th of August 1950, I, as manager of the
Electrics, a local baseball team, walked to the grandstand of the
local stadium here in Great Falls, Montana. It was approximately
1130 AM and my purpose was to check the direction of the wind in
preparation for the afternoon's game.

Looking toward the smoke stack to see in which direction the
wind was blowing the smoke, I saw two saucer shaped, very bright
objects completely motionless and in direct line with the smoke
stack. I was of the opinion that they were aircraft, but after a
few seconds of a still motionless view, I decided that they could
not be aircraft. I immediately ran to my car, which was parked
adjacent to the stadium (approximately 50 Ft.) to get my movie
camera. At the same time I shouted for my secretary, and her independent description of these two objects is identical to mine. At
the time I thought there might have been a whistling noise, but of
that I am not certain. There was no visible exhaust or fire and
the objects seemed like two new dimes glistening in the sun. I
did not take time to return to the exact spot from where I had
originally noticed these objects. I prepared my camera and started
taking pictures, from a point immediately adjacent to my car. By
this time, approximately five or eight seconds had elapsed since
I had run to my car. The two objects were again motionless, but
at a point to the left of the smoke stack. It was at this point
that I first filmed these two objects. I repeat, they were not
covering any distance; that is, they were motionless, but an
occasional vibration seemed to momentarily tilt them, after which
they would instantly correct their level plane to its seemingly
balanced position. The two objects made an abrupt flight in an

are motion at very high speeds. I approximate the speed to have
been over 400 MPH. At all times the altitude was definitely in
the 5,000 ft. to 10,000 ft. above the terrain brackets. The end
frames of the movie reel show the objects to be in line with a
high water tower, which is approximately 130 ft. high. I approximate a 30° angle to have been formed by the level ground and a
straight line from the objects to the spot where I was standing.
At the point above the water tower, the objects hovered motionless
for two or three minutes and then flew out of sight. The clearrest
film of these were returned by the Air Force when I first lent
them the movies. The only ones which remain in my possession are
those which show the objects at a considerable distance. I believe
the objects were at all times within 2 or 2½ miles of me. Total
time that the objects were in view: approximately 3½ minutes.

3. Sketch #1 shows the point from which Mr. [redacted] first sighted
the objects. It is approximately the same spot from which he took the
film. The extreme ends of the Great Falls AFB runway are indicated for
evaluation as to flight traffic pattern.

4. Sketch #2 used as the center the exact spot from where original
sightings were made. The spot adjacent to his parked automobile is also
indicated. It was here that the film was taken.

5. It is reported by hearsay that other individuals observed these
objects at the same hour on the same day. However, due to elapsed time
since these sightings, no concrete leads can be found to identify other
witnesses.

6. Mr. [redacted] is the manager of the [redacted]

Shortly after the incident, [redacted] denounced all who claimed to
have seen "flying objects". Particular reference was made to Mr. [redacted].
This bad publicity resulted in the loss as sponsors on nine (9) of the
Fourteen (14) radio stations for Mr. [redacted] sportcasts. It was
[redacted] months before these stations returned to Mr. [redacted]'s program
and this doubtlessly resulted in considerable financial loss to him.
At present, Mr. [redacted] is in the final stages of a lawsuit against
[redacted].

7. Mr. [redacted] is well-known as a pleasant, friendly, courteous
and competent individual. There seem to be no ulterior motives involved.

Publicity is probably the only benefit he could have derived but, well-known as he is, publicity is no problem for him. Conversation with a local physician and an assistant district attorney disclosed no derogatory information. Mr. [redacted] is well accepted and highly regarded in the community.

8. OSI was contacted. They have knowledge of the incident but no copies of the interrogation; nor do they believe any could be found other than those originally forwarded with the film in 1950.

9. Personal opinion expressed by interrogator: "This is the third or fourth time I have interviewed Mr. [redacted] on this subject. At all times he was polite and consistent. His only complaint against the Air Force is that several frames (about 36% of the total) were removed when the film was originally lent the Air Forces. Despite this, he has been most cooperative and all his reports on the matter appear to be honest and sincere beliefs."

OFFICE OF RECORD

Mr. A. M. Rochlen
Vice President - Public Relations
Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc.
Santa Monica, California

Dear Mr. Rochlen:

This office is in receipt of the extremely able analysis performed by the Douglas Aircraft Company on the film of an unidentified flying object photographed by Mr. _______ in August 1950, and interest has no objections to the release of this report, in whole or in part, to the Greene-Rouse Studies.

We agree with the conclusions stated in the second paragraph of page 3 of your report. However, the statement attributed to Mr. _______ (3rd par., page 1) that a number of frames had been removed from the film while in the possession of the Air Force is without foundation. In fact, the official Air Force files indicate that the film was damaged, cannibalised when received, and that this was acknowledged by both Mr. _______ and the local Air Force representative. The Air Force requested Mr. _______ to copy the film, advising him at the same time that a frame or two might be lost in the process. Mr. _______ wired permission the following day through the local Air Force representative.

We greatly appreciate you sending us your report, the conclusions of which will be reflected in the next release of the Air Force's "Bluebook" project report on UFOs. The previous release of this report "Analysis of Reports of Unidentified Aerial Objects" represented the critical analyses of all reports and sightings from 1947 to 1955. It includes the efforts of many highly competent scientists, analysts, and special consultants. Reports used were derived from all sources - ranging from well-known scientists and experienced pilots to the average man-on-the-street.

As you may know, the Honorable Donald A. Quarles, Secretary of the Air Force on the 25th of October 1955 publicly released the summary of this report. This summary stated that through the continuous use of the services of well-known scientists and by constantly improved analytical techniques, your very frank technological and investigative methods, the Air Force has reduced the number of "unknowns" from approximately 10% in 1947 to 3½% as of this date. The "unknowns" are, of course, the prime

The following is an outline of the procedures executed to obtain the finished product of 8 x 10 glossy paper photographic prints.

1. Original film was 16 mm motion picture Kodachrome film.

2. This film was enlarged in a Leitz Focomat Enlarger onto 4 x 5 Panchromatic cut film. This film was processed by normal methods in Eastman D-76 developer.

3. These 4 x 5 cut film negatives were then enlarged in a Omega D-2 Enlarger onto 8 x 10 projection printing paper.

The degree of enlargement in all cases is held constant. Development times for the intermediate negatives and the projection prints are held as constant as possible. The finished prints have a grainy appearance due to the extreme enlargement of the original 16 mm film. The mark at the left top of the print is the image of dirt in the film gate of the motion picture camera used to take the original photographs.

Analysis of Photographic Material                Serial 01

No details can be recognized on the images of the objects, i.e. no structure of any kind, no color fringes, no shape, even under a high power microscope. The images are uniformly round white dots, except a few which are oblong (frames 15, 17, 19 or 56, etc.), both objects parallel, probably as a result of camera motion blur. The sun is known to have been on the left of the photographer, at an elevation of about 550 and on an azimuth of 1540 (confirmed by shadows on the film). There is no conclusive evidence that they were self-luminous compared against the prevailing sunlight.

Several additional pertinent pieces of information were learned from Mr. [redacted] in telephone conversations on March 17 and March 23, 1955, to wit: The Revere turret type camera was equipped with a telephoto lens of 3" focal length and operated at 16 frames/second. He noticed on surface wind to speak of at the time, possibly due to shielding by the bleachers, just a gentle breeze. He recalled that a wind sprang up later in the afternoon. An aerial photograph of the ball park showing the grain elevators and water tower in part was obtained (figure 2).

With the knowledge of the focal length and frame speed, the transverse component of the velocity of the objects can be correlated to their altitude and distance from the observer (for the objects at the start of filming). Assuming the azimuth heading to be 1710, the total velocity can be similarly correlated. Since only angular distances from one station are available for measurement, the actual range at any one time cannot be determined.

[A table follows with columns for Initial Distance, Altitude, Transverse Velocity, and Total Velocity]

Incidental information presently available comprises the following: Great Falls, Montana is situated on the upper Missouri River, just East of the Rocky Mountains at latitude 470 30' and longitude 1110 18'. Altitude is 3,132 feet.

* Azimuth and altitude of the sun were computed utilizing references (1) and (2) listed at the end of this report.

Jet aircraft based here at that time, so that if any were in the air, they would have been transients. That the bright photographed spots could have been the jet exhausts of the two aircraft seen from the rear has been suggested but this explanation is not convincing, the contrast against the blue sky being much greater than could be expected of jet exhaust under the film exposure conditions.

The objects left no observable trail and their tracking for 16 seconds and reported observation for about 50 seconds makes the assumption that they were two fragments of a shattered meteorite rather improbable *. Their shape, brightness, speed, almost precisely rectilinear path, steady motion, and separation cannot be reconciled with the supposition that they were birds †. These same facts together with the weather report also seem to rule out various forms of optical atmospheric mirages or cloud reflections (10).

It is apparent that the most possible natural phenomenon which could account for these film effects would be airplane reflections. There are, however, several factors which make such a hypothesis quite strained. First, it is not certain that there were jet planes or other aircraft flying in formation at this particular time and place. Second, the reflection from the moving planes must have persisted for at least 50 seconds (N.B. man estimated that it took him 30 seconds or more after first observing the UFO's to run to his car, set the camera and start filming). His secretary, also at the scene, testifies that the objects remained in view throughout the period between the first sighting and filming. It would require a very rare coincidence of airplane maneuvering for reflections to persist this long. The possible parabolic flight paths of the airplanes which would result in such long persistent reflections are presented in Figure 11. These parabolic flight paths completely abandon the 117° azimuth heading hypothesis. (The maximum speed (dive) of the F94 is 602 mph, landing speed is 130 mph, stalling speed is 108 mph.) ** Observed airplane reflections have lasted less than 20 seconds. Third, assuming a 117° azimuth heading, the orientation of the airplane and the sun is some 52° off in the horizontal direction and

* Meteors seldom are visible for more than three seconds (4), (5). Some bright fireballs can be observed for up to six seconds but their orbital and angular velocity would no doubt be quite different. Their trails may persist up to 40 seconds (5).

† The speeds involved might possibly be compatible with those of birds. Birds with maximum wing spread of 3 to 4 feet might have been present in this region (7). Also it is noted that ducks and geese have maximum velocities from 55 to 60 mph (8). However, it is doubted if any birds would have flight characteristics as depicted on the film, e.g., if they were gliding, a more curving movement rather than angular and flapping, usually 5 to 13 strokes per second (cf. (9)), a more erratic path with great variations in luminosity would show. Finally, the UFO images are very different from those produced by birds at any distance.

** All of these paths are directed away from the Air Force Base but might inconceivably be a section of a landing pattern. Note that all paths initially come closer to the observer giving a better opportunity for visual recognition of them as being jet planes.

42° off in the vertical direction from the optimal reflective angle. *
(This means the flight path would have to be headed 260° more west and the
plane rolled 210 for optimal reflection to be achieved.) An assumption
implicit in this argument is that the objects were at optimal angle of re-
flection just as the first frame was taken. The optimum angle didn't
occur inter as maximum or intensity is observed (just on approximate
incidence decrease in intensity, cf. figure 6). That the objects were first
photographed just at their optimal reflective angle would be fortuitous
indeed. Thus 52° represents the smallest angular discrepancy and in all
likelihood this discrepancy in the horizontal was greater. The last two
facts assume particular importance when it is noted that a typical airplane
will reflect only when it is within 10° horizontally and 20° (in reflection
up to 45°) vertically of its optimal angle of reflection †. In fact, as-
suming that the objects kept a nearly rectilinear course, their brightest
sun reflection should have occurred some 30° after they disappeared from
view. Fourth, the distance of these hypothetical planes roughly probably
have been over five miles; otherwise on this very clear day (visibility 60
miles) they could have been rather easily identified as planes on the film
(at least on the last few frames. Admittedly these images don't actually
cf. figure 10(c)) or by Mr. [redacted] or his secretary **. This distance,
however, seems much too large when one considers the size and intensity of
the images on the first few frames. Admittedly these images don't actually
portray the real dimension of the reflecting surface (cf. appendix II) but
they do give an indication of the relative magnitude of the size. This
indication would roughly put the reflecting airplanes between one and three
miles from the observer. The fifth consideration which strains the airplane
hypothesis is the reported hovering of the UFO's. This might be accounted
for by a flight path at a very great distance from the observer or one
making a very small angle to the observer so that the traverse component of
velocity would be small. The latter possibility is ruled out because of the
sun's position relative to the plane and the former would necessitate an
extreme decrease in the plane's distance in a very short period of time.

* Optimal reflection is achieved when the angle of incidence of the sun's
rays on the object is equal to the angle of reflection to the observer,
the angles being taken with respect to the axis of the aircraft.

† These facts are confirmed with respect to the F94 jet and DC-6 airplane
configurations. The discrepancy in the sun's angle of incidence verti-
cally excludes reflection from vertical planar surfaces such as tail
fins, etc. but still 10°-some partial reflection from the curved
fuselage of the plane. These reflections are less intense and in the
vertical plane may be observed up to about 45° from the optimal angle
of reflection. On the other hand, reflections from the fuselage appear
to completely disappear when the angle is off only 10° in the horizontal
plane, cf. appendix II.

At five miles a typical fifty foot airplane subtends angles of 7' by 2'.
The resolving power of the eye is from 1' to 3' (12) while that of the
camera set at F/22 is about 1 1/2'. (Its theoretical resolving power,
exclusive of aberrations, is on the order of 40"), cf. figure 10(b) for
the size of an airplane silhouette as it would appear on the scale of
the film. These conclusions are borne out by the aircraft recognition
silhouette card furnished by the Air Force to the Ground Observer Corps.

On the other hand, the photographs shown in Appendix II do seem to indicate that airplane reflections might possibly look like the images shown on the film. Of course, balloons, shiny insects etc. or for that matter, bright light source in the sky subtending a small angle would also give rise to such images. The fact that the images do fade is reminiscent of airplane reflective phenomena, although any non-isotropic or variable intensity radially source could fade in like manner. The discrepancy in the azimuth heading for sun reflection might be decreased by large cross winds (they could conceivably reorient the plane's direction by about 5°) but the angular discrepancy still exists and along with the image size, remains a thorn in the side of the airplane reflection hypothesis.

The author acknowledges with regret that, despite the considerable amount of effort spent on the analysis of the evidence and circumstances of the "Montana UFO Case", no clearcut conclusion could be brought out. The indications as to what those objects may have been are not hard to narrate but the conflict which remains between some details of the photographic material evidence and the uncertainty of some of the reported observations and witnesses accounts. Whether a better clarification of the recorded phenomenon could have been attained by a more searching investigation on the spot at the time, still remains difficult to assess.

APPENDIX I

Let us define the following quantities:

A   = altitude of the objects above the observer - arbitrary units.
h   = altitude of the objects (the midpoint of their line of centers) above the horizon in degrees.
L   = distance between the objects - arbitrary units.
R   = distance of the objects from the observer - arbitrary units.
T   = time measured after initial observation in seconds.
V   = velocity of the objects - arbitrary units.
α   = azimuth of line of sight between the observer and center point of the objects.

β Δ γ + δ.
γ   = angle between the line of centers of the objects and their direction of motion.
δ   = angle between the perpendicular to the line of sight and the object's path.
Δ   = azimuth of direction of the object's path (heading).
φ   = angle between the initial line of sight and the line of sight at time T in radians or degrees.
θ   = angle subtended by the apparent separation of the two objects - radians.

The zero subscript refers to the value of the quantity at the time of initial observation. Note that the initial separation may be "measured" before the initial elevation and azimuth since background objects (by which height and azimuth may be referenced) do not appear until frame #65.

Let us assume β, γ, γ', A, L and V to remain constant during the entire period of observation, i.e. constant configuration rectilinear motion.
We denote this constant value by a zero subscript.

For simplicity we define the following dimensionless quantities.

Consideration of figure 7 and application of the law of cosines together with trigonometric manipulation yields:

tan h = tan h₀ / √[1 + 2 t sin δ₀ + t²]                (1)

cos ø = (1 + t sin δ₀) / √[1 + 2 t sin δ₀ + t²]        (2)

θ₀/θ ≃ (1 + 2 t sin δ₀ + t²) / (1 + t sin γ₀)          (3)

In the example at hand the total elapsed time of observation is on the order of 15 seconds and the angular sweep of the objects across the sky (θ) is about 20°. Thus

0 ≤ t < 0.3

Using equations (1), (2) and (3) the dashed lines depicting theoretical pointing headings (figures 5a and 5b) are computed.

There does exist a random error (attributed to errors in measurement or to slight variations of the UFO's motion) about the theoretical 170° azimuth heading line of ±5° in the case of the altitude and azimuth plot and ±0.5° in the time vs. separation plot. This random scattering of experimental points could at most mask a variation in altitude or separation of ±1%. In particular, there is a slight variation in both plots (frames 120 to 175) towards the 160° azimuth heading. However, the general tendency of the points to maintain the same angular direction was reasonable. Without an offset indicated that this slight variation doesn't represent a true change in direction, but rather a slight reorientation, slipping or curving motion of the objects. If a curving motion was responsible, the tangents to the curve would lie somewhere between 165° and 173° azimuth heading.

No plate (or rather frame) distortion correction formula has been applied to the UFO's coordinates as measured directly from the film. It is assumed that since the objects are near the center of the frame for most of the shots, any error due to distortion or emulsion shrinkage etc. would be much less than the standard deviation of ±5' and therefore would not effect the over-all accuracy of the results.

APPENDIX II

The image of any brilliant light source as seen by either the eye or a camera can appear much larger than the luminous object. An extreme example of this effect is shown in figure 8(a) which is a blown up 16 mm frame showing the image of a 1 1/4" plane mirror at 180 feet reflecting the sun directly into the 1" lens of a camera. The mirror's true size is exaggerated some 15 times. This test has obviously bearing on the analysis of UFO films. It therefore motivated a photogrammetric experiment conducted by the author on December 10, 11, 1955. The experiment was devised in order to obtain empirical information on the effect of distance, lens focal length, iris stop, frame speed, etc. on the photographic images of various small bright sources of reflected sunlight (cf. figure 8(b)).

One hundred and nineteen combinations of these parameters were examined. The tests included still, as well as 16 mm and 8 mm movie pictures and shots of actual airplane reflections also were taken.

The most pertinent facts gleaned from this experiment involved the analysis of optimal specular sun reflections * from a chrome plated Model DC-6 (cf. figure 8(c) and a bright cylindrical reflector (cf. figure 9(a)). Both these objects show a magnification in the size of the image photographed over that of the actual object. Figure 8(c) shows a DC-6 model photographed from a distance that would give the same size picture as the full scale airplane from about two miles; the bright images are of dimension corresponding to 0.004 x 0.002 radians. * Figure 9(a) shows reflection (at optimal angle) from a cylindrical reflector corresponding in geometry to a fifty-foot airplane at a distance of about two miles. The bright image's angular diameter was 0.0015 radians. ** Figure 9(b) is a blown up frame taken from the Montana film. The image's angular diameter was 0.0014 radians. The UFO image intensity appears to be slightly less than that of the experimental picture but variation in development techniques would not affect analysis in this regard. Figure 9(c) shows optimal sun reflections from four jet planes; estimated distance was two and one half miles; the angular diameter of the bright image was 0.0014 x 0.0006 radians. The reflection from these jets lasted about 5°. Figure 10(a) shows optimal reflection from a commercial plane (100 foot) in a landing pattern over the Los Angeles International Airport. Its estimated distance was 12 miles and the angular diameter was 0.0003 radians. (The reflection in this case lasted about 10°.)

* Optimal reflection is achieved when the angle of incidence of the sun's rays on the object is equal to the angle of the reflection to the observer, the angles being taken with respect to the axis of the aircraft involved.

* All the shots were taken with a three inch telephoto lens, at 16 fps, f/22, and with Kodachrome daylight color film. Thus they should correlate with the actual Montana film.

** These frames show up rather poorly when reproduced. All measurements were made on the actual movie negatives.

In order to compare the UFO frames with a typical fifty foot airplane, silhouettes are included in figure 10(b). Figure 10(c) shows the UFO's just before they fade from view.

The experimental results appear to indicate that if the first few frames of the UFO film show sun reflections from airplanes which are optimally oriented with respect to the sun then the planes would have been on the order of one to three miles distant from the observer. If, however, these first few frames represent images of the reflection from airplanes not quite optimally oriented then the planes could have been at closer distance. Even in the light of many sources of image distortion the experimental shots indicate that the image size of the UFO's could not be reconciled with airplane fuselage reflections at even four miles.

Airplane reflections have been observed both photographically and visually to persist (total angular distance from fade-in to fade-out) over angular travel ranges less than 20° (No moon diameters). This conclusion was borne out by manipulation of model airplanes (DC-6 and T-6A) in strong sunlight.

The effects which accounted for the distortion in image size may be listed as follows: scattering in the atmosphere (between the light source and the camera), * optical aberrations (coma, astigmatism, distortion), * flaring at the lens surfaces, diffraction, turbidity in the film (sometimes called "photographic craspedomorphology"), reflections off the film backing (halation) and finally adjacency effects (chemical reactions between over-exposed and under-exposed areas usually produce Frings called Makle line or Eberhard effect). There are also distortions produced during development and reprinting. An excellent description and analysis of all of the above effects is presented in reference (11).

All of these effects will cause, to a greater or lesser degrees, the image on the film to appear larger than the source. * The stronger the light source, the more prominent these effects become. Curved reflecting surface become a much less intense source (cf. figures 9(a) and 9(c)) and also have the property of not needing to be precisely oriented with respect to the sun in order to yield a bright image. Thus fuselage skin reflections aren't as bright as direct specular reflections but last over a greater angle.

There is also quite a difference between specular reflections from fins, wings, plane windows etc. and those from the fuselage. Fins, wings and windows have more nearly planar surfaces and therefore produce more intense reflections; however, a very slight change in orientation with respect to the sun (10 to 5°) will completely destroy the reflections. Fuselage surfaces have greater curvature and thus produce less intense reflections but the angle of orientation is not quite as critical - e.g., 5° to 10° in the horizontal plane and sometimes up to 45° in the vertical plane.

* Light sources brilliant enough to produce this form of large scale broadening are sufficiently intense to produce noticeable diffraction effects, cf. Figure 8(a). The crosses of light appearing on the image broadening are sufficiently through the polygonal iris of the camera. This broadening is often called "aureole", cf. reference (13), p. 69.

† Attenuation of the light (e.g. associated with scattering, etc.) will tend to decrease many of the sources of broadening, however.

Because of the above described effects, the proportions of bright objects seen from a distance may also be distorted (cf. figure 9(a) where a cylinder of length to width ratio of 1:3 appears almost like a circular dot). In spite of this, fuselage reflections from planes appear to be slightly elongated, cf. figure 9(c).

Of course, the amount of elongation depends upon the perspective of the observer and the distance of the object.

In the case of the Montana films (the object's line of motion making an angle of 550 with the line of sight) the fact that the image appears as uniform white dots cannot serve as a valid deterrent to an airplane reflection hypothesis. However, this rather large angle does mean that the image would be smaller and even closer than three miles. † In figure 9(c) the jet plane motion made an angle of only about 300 to 400 with the observer's line of sight and the image definitely appears oval.

* The slight oval appearance is due exclusively to movement of the camera as mentioned in the main report.

† Examination of figures 10(b) and 10(c) would indicate that airplanes as close as this would certainly appear on the film.

On 5 October 1950, Mr. [redacted] advised that the camera used by him in the taking of the moving picture film transmitted under separate cover, was a Revere, 16 mm. magazine loading type with an F. 1.9 wide-angle, telephoto lens.  Mr. [redacted] stated that the settings used at the time were: shutter opening F.22 and focal setting, infinity.  Film make and type was Eastman Kodachrome, daylight type, and speed at which pictures were taken was sixteen frames per second.  Mr. [redacted] further advised that in operating the camera in taking the pictures, he had "panned" the camera slowly from right to left.

2. A further check of the records of Base Operations, Great Falls Air Force Base, Great Falls, Montana, indicates that an F-94 type aircraft, #2503, and F-94 type aircraft, #2502, landed at Great Falls Air Force Base at 1133 and 1130 hours (Mountain Standard Time) respectively on 15 August 1950.  These aircraft were assigned the 449th Fighter Squadron, Ladd Air Force Base, Alaska.  Mr. [redacted] stated that almost immediately after taking the motion pictures, two USAF jet aircraft flew across the sky east of him, heading in a southerly direction.

WITH REGARD TO YOUR COMMENTS ON THE
GREAT FALLS INCIDENT, THE MATTER WOULD
HAVE BEEN CLEARED IF YOU PERSONNEL
HAD BEEN COOPERATIVE TO REVIEW THE
FOLDER MATERIAL WAS IN COLONEL WATSON'S
POSSESSION AT YOUR HEADQUARTERS SOMETIME, THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED AT
APPROXIMATELY 1150 MST ON 9 AUGUST
1950. GENERAL WELD TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS HAS A WIDE ANGLE
LOADING TYPE WITH AN 1:45 WIDE ANGLE
ELECTRONIC LENS PHOTOGRAPHS WHICH ARE
OF POOR QUALITY ARE BEING FORWARDED
FOR YOUR REVIEW.

GREAT FALLS AIR FORCE BASE
INDICATES THAT TWO F-84 AIRCRAFT WERE
IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME ALSO. WE
REPORTED SEEING TWO OF THE AIRCRAFT IN FLIGHT IMMEDIATELY AFTER PARKING
THE PHOTOGRAPHS. IN FACT THE INFORMANT
ADVISED THAT THE OBJECTS REPORTED
AND THE JET AIRCRAFT OBSERVED WERE
BOTH TRAVELING IN THE SAME GENERAL
DIRECTION AND SIGHTED FROM WHERE HE IS
LOCATED. THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION
IS THAT THE WOULD-BE OBJECTS WERE
ACTUALLY REFLECTIONS ON THE SUN OF THE
TWO AIRCRAFT IN THE VICINITY. IN FACT
SUN REFLECTION FROM AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN
ONE OF THE TWO CAUSES OF UNIDENTIFIED
OBJECT REPORTS.

Dear Mr. Bowden:

This will reply to your questions concerning the observation of unidentified aerial phenomena by Mr. [redacted], Great Falls, Montana on 15 August 1950. Since I understand from Lt. Hughey of the file in this case was located and offered to you for examination before you departed, I take it that you will not require any copies of material as suggested.

(1) This case came to the attention of the Air Force by a letter from the Great Falls Leader, Great Falls, Montana dated September 13, 1950, signed by Lt. C. A. Sullivan.

(2) Mr. [redacted] was interviewed by an officer from a nearby Air Force organization. Information was submitted voluntarily.

(3) The observer stated the sighting took place between 1125 and 1130 hours, MST, 15 August 1950 and phenomena were in sight for a period of about eight seconds. Mr. [redacted] stated that a time of approximately 20 seconds elapsed between his first sighting of the objects and completion of his photography of them. It should be noted that this last time interval was obtained from a narrative report of the investigating officer, and is not a direct quotation of statement by Mr. [redacted].

(4) No reply can be made to your question concerning relative size of objects as they appeared in film compared to film size, since film was returned to Mr. [redacted] and is not available for examination.

(5) Conclusion as to probable cause of sighting in this case is: Unknown

MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE
Attn: Lt Colonel T. R. Johnson, AFOIN-X

SUBJECT: (Uscla) UFO Movie

1. The following statements concerning two of the UFO sightings described in the recently released movie, are submitted in response to Mr. Monts' request of 29 May 1956.

a. The [redacted] Case - Montana - 1950. The original Air Force conclusion, based on the interrogation of witnesses and the evaluation of the data, was that the UFOs were, in all probability, two Air Force F-94 fighter aircraft known to be in the vicinity at the times.

Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances, made by an aircraft manufacturing firm in a recent independent and unolicited analysis of the [redacted] film, show striking similarity to the two white blops in this film.

Based on the degrees of credibility accorded this early ATIC evaluation and the strong corroborative evidence supplied by the recent independent analysis, the Air Force has no compelling reason to alter its original conclusion.

b. The [redacted] - Utah - 1952. The original film was analysed by an Air Force Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory shortly after the sighting. The conclusion reached was that a strong possibility existed that the bright spots of light appearing on the film were caused by seagulls soaring in thermal air currents. The credibility of the conclusion was undoubtedly supported by the presence of identifiable seagulls in some of the frames.

This conclusion was further strengthened by movies of seagulls, taken at various distances, which showed them as bright spots of light similar to those in the [redacted] film.

Memo to D/I (OIN-X), (U) UFO Movie, 1 Jun 56

A recent analysis of the [redacted] film, made by Air Force photo specialists totally unaware of the previous history of this case, yielded the opinion that the bright spots of light on the film were bird reflections in the strong sunlight.

The unanimity of opinion present in all evaluations made in this case leaves reasonable doubt that the UFOs in the [redacted] film were indeed seagulls.

2. Attached is a copy of this memo to be given to Mr. M. A. Monts in the Air Force Press Room in the Pentagon.

Here is the text from the document:

SO THERE ARE no flying saucers? Well, I saw them on screen when the Clarence Greene-Russell
(Nature film, "Flying Saucers") was presented. Skeptics
"Doesn't seem to be any specific, which objects our air force definitely cannot identify were
not planes, not birds, not aircraft, not
film, and not faked," was the
film's breathless content of the
time.

Here on the screen, for the first
time a terrific color footage of "saucers" in flight—footage which up to this time has
been held top secret. Skeptics
think twice before dismissing
the saucer as a fantasy. But how
loose the official air force procedure is a story in itself.

MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT DEPUTY, SCIENCE AND COMPONENTS

SUBJECT: UFO Film

1. The film "UFO" referenced in the attached letter was produced by the Greene-House Studios and released in 1956. Major Dewey Fournest, Jr., Capt. Edward Ruppelt and Mr. Albert M. Chop all were hired as technical advisors, but none had connection with the Air Force in any official capacity at the time. All of the actors in the picture were professionals and no person connected with any of the cases depicted took part.

2. The film of cases incorporated as a part of this picture was obtained from the original owners, [redacted] (The [redacted] Case) and Mr. [redacted] (The [redacted] Case). The Air Force had no connection with the release of this film.

3. A short summary of the two cases follows:

[Redacted] Case
Title - 1130
Date - 15 August 1950
Place - Great Falls, Montana

Mr. [redacted] and his secretary were out to inspect a ball park near Great Falls, Montana when they sighted two objects in the sky which they could not identify. Mr. [redacted] took some film of the objects with his Revere turret type 16mm camera.

The objects in this case were analyzed as two F-94 aircraft which were known to be in the area at the time. Simulated photos of aircraft made by an aircraft research firm in an independent and unsolicited analysis was strikingly similar to the [redacted] film.


- page 111 -

Time - 1110
Date - 2 July 1952
Place - Tremonton, Utah

Of Tremonton, Utah when they sighted 10 or 12 objects in the sky while they could not identify, could take some film of the objects with a Bell and Howell Automaster, with 3° telescope lens. This film was subsequently analyzed by the Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory of WADC as pictures of soaring seagulls.

6. The well-known Montana movies of which there has also been a great deal of controversy.

The Montana movies were probably F-94 Starfighters which were in the area at the time of the sighting. These aircraft are capable of supersonic flight and have reheat or afterburner capability.

Yes, I have seen the films in question. The Montana films were good from the standpoint of having some reference to angular momentum. The Air Force answer after viewing the film and investigating was that the two objects were probably F-94 aircraft which were wide in that area at the time of the sightings. These aircraft have supersonic capability through reheat or afterburner.

The Montana films depicted probably F-94 Starfire fighter aircraft with afterburners functioning and moving at supersonic speeds. There were F-94's (radar equipped interceptors) in the area at the time of the sighting.
