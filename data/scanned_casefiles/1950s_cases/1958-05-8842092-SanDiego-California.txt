Balloon schedules indicate a balloon
was scheduled to be released from
Montgomery Field at time of sighting.
The surface winds were such as to
of blowing the balloon over observer at around
600 ft. the wind is from the south,
according to the northly movement.
The object sighted is no doubt a
balloon with a light.
