SUMMARY: (Use same summary as report. Give disposition in next paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Enter on AF Form 112—Part (1).)

An unidentified object was sighted at approximately 1945 MST and again at 2300 by Miss [redacted] and Mr. & Mrs. [redacted], all of Black Hawk, South Dakota. Miss [redacted] noticed the object when she happened to glance toward the sky and saw this red glow which was traveling back and forth from north to south.

The object did this for quite some time and then disappeared behind a hill. This object gave off a red glow and then changed to a whitish yellow glow. The time of this was approximately 1945. Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] noticed the object at the time and report the same as Miss [redacted]. They then went to a drive in movie and saw the object again. They said it seemed to hover over the screen and then changed to a trailing white. After a few minutes, it suddenly disappeared.

On 6 August 1953, an unidentified object report was submitted to this organization from the Rapid City filter Center and it stated that these people saw something or it is merely a figment of their imagination due to the long hours they spend on the GOC post in Black Hawk.

On 15 September 1953, at approximately 1945 hours MST, Miss [redacted] of Black Hawk, South Dakota was attending a 4-H meeting when she glanced into the sky and saw a red glow which seemed to be traveling approximately 150 to 200 mph. The children at the meeting also saw the object but Miss [redacted] states that their age range from nine to fifteen years and it would be almost impossible to get a complete and accurate report of the object from them. The object was seen for approximately thirty minutes and then disappeared behind a hill.

At the same time, Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] also of Black Hawk, noticed the object and reported the same as Miss [redacted] to this organization.

At 2330 hours MST, Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] again saw the object which appeared over the movie screen at a Drive In Theater. They stated that the object seemed to be traveling closer to the screen and then suddenly turned a brilliant white as an incombustible headlight and then disappeared behind a hill to the north.

The sky at these times was clear of clouds and there were many stars. The moon was in the west at the time and was giving off a very dull glow.

Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] stated that they watched the object for approximately twenty minutes before it disappeared.

This object seemed to appear to stand still at times and also to flicker such as a star would do. Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] also stated that the object turned to a yellow glow but for a few seconds and then changed to the brilliant white.

Comments of Preparing Officer:

All three civilian reports of this object have been involved before in flying object reports. It is the personal opinion of the undersigned that if the objects matched the description as reported, they would have been seen and reported by many more people.
