Dear Sirs:

I wish to report the sighting of a so-called flying saucer on May 29, 1954 while driving from Lordsburg, New Mexico to Tucson, Arizona.

At a point someplace between Willcox and Benson along U.S. 80 my attention was attracted from the road by the reflection of the sun on a shiny, disc-shaped object. It appeared to tilt toward me and in so doing is caught the reflection of the sun. The reflection was lost, and then the object resumed a more horizontal position and the reflection was lost.

I would estimate that I viewed the object at an angle of about 30 degrees and it might have been two to five miles distant. It appeared to be about 25 ft. in diameter and perhaps 8 to 10 ft. in thickness. In the brief time it was visible it seemed to be stationary. I was alone in the car at the time so there was no other witness that I know of.

Very truly yours,
