Here is the text from the document:

39/103 AM
LORDSBURG NEW MEXICO

June 9, 1954

Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report the sighting of a so-called flying saucer on May 29, 1954 while driving from Lordsburg, New Mexico to Tucson, Arizona.

At a point someplace between Willcox and Benson about 10:30 AM my attention was attracted from the road by the reflection of the sun on a smooth, silvery, disc-shaped object. It appeared to tilt toward me and in so doing it caught the reflection of the sun. The reflection lasted for a period of 2 to 5 seconds and then the object resumed a more horizontal position and the reflection was lost.

I would estimate that I viewed the object at an angle of about plus 20 degrees and it might have been two to five miles distant. It appeared to be about 50 ft. in diameter and perhaps 6 ft. thick. In the brief time it was visible I could not detect any lateral movement. I was alone at the time so there was no other witness that I know of.

Very truly yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]
