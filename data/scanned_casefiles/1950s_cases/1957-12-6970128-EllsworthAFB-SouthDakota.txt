11. CHIEF OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. REPOTING AIRMAN CONCIENTIUOS AND DESIRIUOS OF BEING HELPFUL. HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO REPOT ANY SIGHTED. OBJECT FLYING ACROSS THIRTY DEGREES OF HORIZON IN THREE (3) SECONDS PRECLUDES POSSIBILITY OF OBJECT BEING IGH FLYING AIRCRAFT. AT TIME OF SIGHTING SUNLIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT HIGH ALTITUDE AND COULD HAVE RENDERED TRAIL OR SPARK INCONSPICUOUS. BELIEVE OBSERVER SAW METEOR.
