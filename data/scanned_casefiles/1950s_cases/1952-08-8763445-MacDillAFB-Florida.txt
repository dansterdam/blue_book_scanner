On 13 August 1952, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, at 1141 hours local
time (1141) approximately 20 Airmen and two Civilians made the following
sighting:

From one to three flying objects were observed heading approximately
350 degrees and gaining altitude. One object changed course abruptly to
the west moving in excess of 600 MPH. This same object then appeared to
hover for about five minutes then moved at an excessive rate back to the
East, then returned to one point and disappeared in two to three
objects did not alter course but disappeared in a perfectly direct direction. The
period of evaluation was about twenty minutes.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Hq 6th Air Div. Install Officer    IR-108-52        2     3

1. The objects were elongated, indefinite in shape, of unidentifiable color, possibly three in number, were in formation, no visible propulsion system, speed (after turn) in excess of 600 m.p.h., narrative shows one sharp 90° degree turn, one to West, second to East, disappeared in the distance and appeared to emit white light from upper surface (possibly reflected sunlight).

2. 131911Z was time of sighting, duration was about fifteen to twenty minutes.

3. Observation was from the ground, visual.

4. Observers were located on the streets side of the MacDill Base Hangar. Object was first sighted due north, speed, distance, and altitude indeterminable (see narrative # 10). Direction was due north directly over base.

5. The observers were mostly young, inexperienced airmen. However three Non-commissioned Officers and two Civilian, appeared to be sincere, experienced and completely reliable.

6. Weather was hot, humid, clear, no surface wind, 4/10 cumulus broken, bases about 3,000 feet, no wind.

7. No meteorological phenomena is known to so cause this.

8. No photographs or fragments were obtained.

9. No radar contact was established as the radar set was inoperative at this time. No other action taken.

10. Narrative - A total of about twenty airmen and civilians saw what at first looked like a piece of newspaper rising upward on an air current. The object was elongated and apparently floating with a light ascend to be orbiting in flashes from its upper surface (probably related sunlight). Five of the airmen claimed to have seen this object and two felt that they saw three. The balance saw one. The most reliable was the left side observer.

a. One airman claimed the object was egg-shaped, all others concurred that it was shapeless but elongated like a sheet of paper. It was airborne. All personnel agreed that the lower surface was dirty, but color could not be determined because of the distance. From the observers' position the object was North of the observers and away from the sun, the sun being behind and to the left of the observers.

b. Since at least a dozen of the observers saw but one object and the balance could not agree, no formation is believed to have existed. There was no visible trail or exhaust. No propulsion system was apparent.

c. The object seemed to rise vertically and to the North for approximately 1,000 feet. A B-50 flew into the discarders line of vision. The object appeared to be a sensor type aircraft than the B-50 which was at least five miles way at about 5,000 feet. While heading west the object appeared to move in excess of 600 MPH. In its westerly course, it appeared to rise for a few minutes, then more just as rapidly back east climbing and continuing North.

d. The object was reported to 6th Air Division Control Room and radar in Base Operations was alerted however the radar was at that time shut down for maintenance.

e. It is my considered opinion that this report is reliable and a sufficient number of these people are experienced and sincere.
