SUMMARY:

The airmen reporting the sighting were the following:
1/Sgt John E. Dye AF 16724251, 58th Air Base Squadron, Presque Isle Air Force Base
A/2c James F. Parent AF 12810886, 74th Tactical Interceptor Squadron, Presque Isle Air Force Base
A/3c Arthur J. Phair AF 12399969, 58th Air Base Squadron, Presque Isle Air Force Base

Report contains airmen's sighting of unidentified flying object WSW of Presque Isle AFB, Maine during the time of driving on base. Object size varied from pinhead to a small diameter. From observation estimated to be fifteen miles and at an altitude of from 1 - 10,000 feet. Rate of speed is between 1 jet aircraft and maneuver of disappearance and reappearance reported soon.

There is no doubt in the sincerity of the airmen making this report. The type of observation was good and the circumstances of the sighting were carefully evaluated. Lack of experience in this type of evaluation, taking into account the prevailing cloud, background and the reported departure from the flight path of a jet aircraft, slightly impairs the accuracy of this report. While the AF mission at this point did not warrant an extensive investigation, it is not unreasonable to assume that the reported sighting may have been that of the aircraft.

Here is the text from the document:

A. Just one.

Q. Any aerodynamic features?

A. No.

Q. Did it have any trail or exhaust?

A. No, nothing.

Q. What would you say of its speed?

A. I don't think it was unusually fast. The only thing I have come to is that it was slightly faster - came on the distance of the climb. It could have been one or fifteen miles away from me. But I got the impression of speed - but it didn't seem normal. (Fact: came it started to move it moved.) Comes in 25(c).

Q. How did it disappear from sight?

A. Well, once it stopped moving, it just took a few seconds.

Q. How it ended?

A. No.

Q. Who it crashed?

A. No.

Q. How did you see it so as to get it in view, or were you able to fly at 100's side or left?

A. It seemed to get a little dimmer as it faded away.

Q. What did do any maneuver?

A. None, except the change as it went away.

Q. How long did you say you observed what?

A. Maybe 2 minutes.

Q. That distance and at what altitude would you estimate for this object?

A. This would have to be a wild guess. I think that it was 10 or 15 miles away.

Q. How high would you say it was?

[Note: The last question is partially cut off]

The document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom of the page.

UNCLASSIFIED

Q. I don't think it was more than 9,000 feet high.

Q. In what direction was it traveling?

A. It was going to the left or right, toward us and then away. At the time it was disappearing, it was varying directly from us to climbing at a general climb and it seemed to be going directly away from us.

Q. What was the shape of the object?

A. Traveling, it was very small, so came up possibly unnoticed. It was round, somewhat similar as it got smaller away. It was very bright. It was hard to see if it was a projection of the sun. It was bright.

Q. How long have you been in the service?

A. Six (6) years. 4 in the Air Force and 2 in the Infantry.

1. The following information was furnished this office by the 6th OSI District (IG), Robins Air Force Base, Robins Field, Georgia:

"Captain EUGENE E. McMANUS, AO-666508, 811th Operations Squadron, 811th Air Base Group, Turner AFB, Ga, reported to this office on 24 July 1952 that on 23 July 1952, while resting and awaiting clearance from Lockbourne AFB, Ohio to Turner AFB, Georgia his attention was directed by members of the Operations Office, Lockbourne AFB, to aerial objects located in the vicinity of Lockbourne AFB and Columbus, Ohio. Captain McMANUS stated that these objects were easily visible to him, and that there were four (4) in number. Capt McMANUS further stated that one of the objects seemed to hover above the other three objects and was not visible at all times, being hidden by the other three objects. Capt McMANUS stated that he observed these objects for approximately 45 minutes and described them as being round in shape and almost fluorescent white in color. He added that he arranged himself so that he could sight along the top of a telephone pole at the objects and that the objects did not seem to have any forward motion, but seemed to be hovering in one particular area. Capt McMANUS further stated that two F-84 aircraft were dispatched from Lockbourne AFB to try to observe and identify these objects, and that upon their return to Operations, they reported that they had obtained an altitude of 43,000 feet and were still unable to identify or approach these unidentified objects. Capt McMANUS further added that weather personnel from Lockbourne AFB set up an observer telescope.

the types used in reading weather balloons, and that
he personally, observed these objects through this
telescope. He continued that with the assistance of
this telescope the objects still appear round in
shape and white in color.  The only assistance the
telescope gave was that the objects seemed to be much
larger. Capt McMANUS further stated that it was re-
ported to Lockbourne Operations while he was there,
that an Observatory in Columbus, Ohio, through means
of triangulation, had placed the height of these ob-
jects at 75,000 feet. Capt McMANUS stated that he
did not see any vapor trails or any glow around the
objects. When asked what he believed the objects to
be, Capt McMANUS stated, 'I do not know. All I know
is that they were round, white in color, and approxi-
mately six inches in diameter.'

"Captain McMANUS is a senior pilot in the United
States Air Force, having approximately 2,200 flying
time, and having served on active duty as a pilot for
approximately ten (10) years.  Captain McMANUS is de-
scribed by his fellow officers as being quiet, very
conscientious, and most reliable."

Aerial Transmission over Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio

at the objects, and that the objects did not seem to have any forward motion. Captain Kehner further states that (a) With aircraft were dispatched from Lockbourne Air Force Base to try to observe and identify these objects, and that upon the pilots' return to Operations, they reported that they had obtained an altitude of 45,000 feet and were unable to identify or approach these unidentified objects. Captain Kehner further stated that while stationed at Lockbourne Air Force Base set up an observer telescope, the type used in reading weather balloons, and that he personally observed these objects through a telescope. The objects well appeared round in shape and white in color.

The only assistance the telescope gave was that the objects seemed to be small. Captain Kehner will further state that an Observatory in Columbus, Ohio, through means of triangulation, had placed the height of these objects at 75,000 feet. Captain Kehner stated that he did not see any vapor trails or any glow around the objects. Then asked what he believed the objects to be, Captain Kehner stated, "I do not know. All I know is that they were round, white, and approximately ten (10) inches in diameter."

Captain Kehner is a senior pilot in the United States Air Force, having accumulated approximately ten (10) years of active duty, very experienced, and most reliable.

3. ACTION: In view of the fact that these aerial objects were sighted over Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio, as action is contemplated

Statement of and answers to questions by S/Sgt John E. Dye
At 1542M251, 8508 Air Base Squadron, Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine.

"I was driving a car, I was going to turn left as Delano said 'What's that?' 'Where', and I saw it and it was white, very brilliant and somebody said 'Flying Saucer' and somebody said 'Helicopter' and it started moving. It seemed to move to first base. The next morning, while doing that, I noticed it was there and it moved again left or right and then it started moving away and it took about 10 from the time it started toward us until it disappeared."

Q. Did you get a good look at it?
A. Yes.

Q. How long a flash?
A. No, we watched it.

Q. In what direction were you facing when observing the object?
A. I'm not sure.
Q. Facing the North-South runway?
A. I can't.

Q. Were you facing the hospital area?
A. My initial move was close to the road that leads to the restricted area. We were on the fire station side to the left.

Q. Tell me your first experience with this sort of thing?
A. Yes. It didn't seem to fit all. Sometime you just take for granted. I don't know much about it. We don't know whether it was something (the subject). We don't know how long it had been there before we saw it.

Q. What shape would you say it was?
A. It wasn't three dimensional at all. At no time did it have a sense of depth. As far as we were concerned it was round.

Q. How many of these objects did you see? UNCLASSIFIED

A. No.

Q. Did it have any tail or column?

A. No, nothing.

Q. What would you say at its speed?

Q. How did it disappear from sight?

A. Well, sort of charged moving. It just took a few seconds.

Q. Was it sudden?

A. No.

A. None, except the change as it went away.

Q. How long did you see it?

A. It to 2 minutes.
