MEMORANDUM TO DIO-6WD FILES

Subj: Unidentified Flying Object, reporting of                31 October 1958

An unidentified Flying Object, spherical in shape with long "tail" was sighted at 1716Z on 20 October 1958 by one observer aboard the AUD-12 docked at Pier C, U.S. Naval Base, Charleston, South Carolina. This information was furnished the District Intelligence Officer, SIXTH Naval District, 30 October 1958 by telephone and later, by personal interview.

The object was observed by Mr. [redacted], Charleston, S.C., a shipyard worker, apparently reliable.

The object was first sighted about 30 degrees above the horizon traveling downward at an angle of about 20 degrees with a very high rate of speed. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball, glowing red in color, and had a blue streak "tail" estimated to be 30 feet long. The observer stated that the leading edge of the object appeared to be uniform and smooth while the trailing edge was rough and irregular. Visual contact with the object was maintained only momentarily.

Observer stated he moved from his position forward of amidships to the stern of the vessel when the object disappeared behind ships docked nearby. Observer was not able to regain visual contact with object. The observer estimated the position of unidentified object to be ESE of his position at a range of approximately two miles.

Several other workers with observer noted a multi-engine U.S. Air Force aircraft circling the vicinity of the sighting for about ten minutes after original sighting.

The weather was clear and sunny, the day of the reported sighting, 28 October 1958. The observer stated that the object was very bright although the weather was clear and sunny.

Mr. [redacted] also reported that he and his wife had sighted the "missile part" reported to be "tumbling" through space in July 1958 while driving his automobile on a local highway. (This "missile part" is thought to be USSR Satellite reported to re-entering earth's atmosphere.)

The observer, [redacted], Charleston, S.C. is employed as a leadingman shipfitter at the U.S. Naval Shipyard, Charleston, S.C. and presently working aboard the AUD-12, a floating drydock located at Pier [redacted], U.S. Naval Base, Charleston, S.C.

The observer does not wish his name connected with this sighting in the event it is made public information.

There was no further evidence concerning this sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Charleston Air Force Base, S. C.

1. At approximately 17552 hours, 28 October 1958, T/Sgt A/AC (cot. of the 44th FIS) observer, at Bunting Building S-706 (Administrative Building), 44th FTS Area, scanning Far a squadron aircraft that was to Land on Runway 33, when they first observed what appeared to be a white ball of fire, about the size of a dime, with orange tail, about the length of a standard lead pencil held at arm's length. The object was first sighted on an azimuth of 125° and approximately 10°, descending and disappearing behind some trees. At approximately 1958 and approximately 1-3 seconds, no visual aids were used and no aircraft were observed in area at time of sighting.

2. A/AC, also of the 44th FTS, reported substantially the same information with the following variation: After first observing the object disappear, he never witnessed the secondary appearance, and although he never checked his watch at the time of the sighting, he believes it was between 1800 and 1900Z hours. Airman was in the ramp area of the 44th FTS at the time of observation and approximately 550 feet NE of Building S-706, location of original sighting. No visual aids were used and total time of sighting was 2-5 seconds.

3. 1st Lt. John Doe, approximately age 30, North Charleston, S. C., who is employed as a teamster with the Overnite Transportation Company, Charleston Heights, S. C., reported while he was driving on a small rural road, approximately five miles NW of Harleyville, S. C., he observed what appeared to be a burning jet aircraft falling, and it appeared to be going to crash. In his statement, he stated that due to the winding road he could not state definitely what direction he was heading in but felt reasonably sure it was to the east. Subject described object as having the characteristics of a jet aircraft with approximately half of the dark colored fuselage engulfed in flames. He first observed the object to his right, passing in front of his truck and disappearing behind trees to his left, and could give no estimate of the distance. Subject further stated that approximately two hours later he observed smoke rising from a wooded area approximately two miles west of Cross, S. C., and was under the opinion that it would have been in the vicinity of the crashed airplane. Total time of observation was 10-15 seconds. No visual aids were used and no sound was heard.

4. A check with the following organizations revealed the following information:
a. 1608th ATG Operations, Base Operations, CPT Section, 44th FTS Operations, CAA Control Tower and CAA Traffic Control Committee: Unknown. No aircraft were reported. No unusual sightings and no explanation could be given. The 44th FIS was firing air-to-air rockets 30-50 miles east of Charleston Air Force Base.
