From: [redacted], Supply Department
To: Executive Officer, U. S. Naval Ammunition Depot, Crane, Ind.
Subj: Unidentified flying object; report of

1. At approximately 1638 on the afternoon of 8 October 1955, from a point of observation approximately one mile north of Loogootee, Indiana, I observed an unidentified flying object, apparently round in design, and silver or white in color, passing overhead.

2. This object was traveling in an east-south-easterly direction, at an estimated altitude of 5000 feet, and at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1000 miles per hour. This object which left no visible trail nor made any audible sound was observed for approximately ten to fifteen seconds by myself and Mr. [redacted], Loogootee, Indiana.

3. The day was extremely clear, the sun shining brightly, the sky 100% cloudless, visibility and ceiling unlimited. There was no surface wind.

4. I have observed, during my time in service, both piston engine and jet aircraft under normal and combat conditions. This object was definitely not an airplane of any type that I have ever seen.
