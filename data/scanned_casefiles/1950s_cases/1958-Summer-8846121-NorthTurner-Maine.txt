UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET
UFO REPORT - SUMMARY 1958 (ex 1959)

Prime Witnesses: Walker, Maine (Redacted)
Occupation: Electronic Operator
Others (Not Interviewed): Mr. (Redacted), Turner, Maine (family & co. detective)
PLACE: High Street, Turner, Maine
DATE: Summer, 1958 (or 1959)
TIME: Evening

BACKGROUND: Several residents of the Turner, Maine area observed a strange, luminous object in the sky on the evening of (date redacted). The object was described as being about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, with a fiery-red glow and pulsating lights around its perimeter. The object hovered motionless for a period of time before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

SIGHTING: It was a clear summer's evening. The moon was shining brightly. The witness was standing outdoors when he observed the strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be about the size of a car and was hovering silently over the road. As the witness watched, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view at tremendous speed. The witness immediately reported the sighting to the local authorities.

The object, after hovering for a time, was observed to make a sharp turn and then accelerate to such a speed that it disappeared from sight within a matter of seconds. Several other local residents also reported seeing the strange object in the sky that evening.

UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET (continued)
two saucers, one inverted upon the other and joined by a dark rim which seemed to be transparent, in the center of which was a dense glowing, luminous mass. This was situated about 5 miles N of North Turner, Maine. An unidentified female witness saw them through open window and watched them drop down to just above the trees, hovering motionless for about 5 minutes, then rise vertically so rapidly and silently, and disappear to the left and passed out of sight. She saw no occupant or ther visible source of propulsion. There was no sound. She was so excited and shaken that she did not come to the house to call anyone else to witness. EVALUATION: I checked on everything I could. I know the witness personally and they are vouched for her sincerity and excellent work. She did call the sheriff at the time and reported it, and showed only vague details. I have expressed that USAF would probably all it to be some known aircraft, but do not think this is the case, and I am convinced that what she saw was not any known aircraft at that time. Her report is being carried on as unidentified, due to the fact that she saw clearly what she described and there is no logical explanation as to what the objects could have been.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO sighting, with the object described as a "Revolving Blue Light". The sketch shows the object moving across the sky, with arrows indicating its direction. Below the sketch, there are two photographic images that appear to be scenes from the location where the UFO was sighted, with descriptions of the locations such as "Fisk Street" and "Early Shot".

Text output:

The object seemed to be a revolving blue light, my son mentioned that he thought he saw some red lights, but no other details were given. The object was seen at a tremendous rate of speed, passing across the sky in a matter of seconds. It was sighted at approximately 8:45 pm on June 27, 1958 in North Turner, Maine.

Place: Irish Street, Turner, Maine

Night: The moon was almost overhead and bright - no clouds that I can recall.

After: It was over, and we had settled down - a few days later - it was decided to keep the whole thing and not talk to anyone about it. People who have ever seen such things will understand, but those who have not, are very quick to ridicule.

My sister had gone out to her car for something - I can't remember if I went with her or if my step-father went with her. She noticed the low-flying lights first. We then saw a plane was in trouble, but could hear no motor. After watching a minute or so, and making sure they were not going away, I naturally thought the plane was gliding in and about to crash. The phone was right inside the front door - I called the operator and asked for the Air Force. They told me there was no plane reported in that area - while we were talking, my sister and step-father were shouting to me the direction the lights were moving. They changed directions several times. I was connected with the Civil Defense and they made a note of it.

While my sister had the field glasses most of the time, I could not see as clearly as she. I did think it odd that the lights moved as erratically as they did. They moved from the right side of the field and moved to the left - very unevenly. We thought they had gone away, but still watched. Soon other lights came and those we saw the lights - now two rows of lights move off.

The lot of the lights - a kind of bluish white that penetrated a long way. A "row" of something red was in the first lights. The lights did not blink - they pulsated. (Movement reminds me of the way a squid moves in water).
