REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS HAVE BEEN FREQUENT IN THIS AREA SINCE JULY 1952. ON 23 JULY 1952 AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 HOURS A RESIDENT OF TRENTON, NEW JERSEY, REPORTED SIGHTING A ROUND, LUMINOUS OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER TRENTON. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS HAVING A DIAMETER OF APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET AND EMITTING A BLUE-WHITE GLOW. IT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE REMAINED STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. ANOTHER WITNESS, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE FROM THE FIRST OBSERVER, ALSO REPORTED SIGHTING THE OBJECT AT THE SAME TIME AND DESCRIBED IT IN SIMILAR TERMS. 
DURING AN INTERVIEW ON 24 JULY 1952, THE FIRST OBSERVER STATED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED SIMILAR OBJECTS ON SEVERAL PREVIOUS OCCASIONS IN THIS AREA. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND EMITTED A BLUE-WHITE GLOW. HE ADDED THAT THE OBJECTS SEEMED TO HOVER AND THEN ACCELERATE AND DISAPPEAR AT HIGH SPEEDS. THE OBSERVER CLAIMED THAT THESE SIGHTINGS WERE BECOMING A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN THE TRENTON AREA.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT BY:
ON TUESDAY, JULY 29, 1952, ABOUT 12:25 A.M. (EDT), TWO ARMY PICKETS WERE ON DUTY AT FORT DIX, NEW JERSEY, WHEN THEY OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING IN THE SKY FROM EAST TO WEST. THE LIGHT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING RED AND ROUND IN SHAPE. IT APPEARED TO BE OF VERY LARGE SIZE AND WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT WAS VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE TO FOUR MINUTES.
DISPATCHED BY:
THE OBJECT IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE A METEORITE OR ANY OTHER KNOWN AERIAL PHENOMENA. THE OBSERVERS, WHO HAVE HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN IDENTIFYING AIRCRAFT AND OTHER AIRBORNE OBJECTS, ARE CONVINCED THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT. IT DID NOT DISPLAY ANY CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWN AIRCRAFT, SUCH AS RUNNING LIGHTS OR EXHAUST TRAILS.
CLASSIFICATION OF THIS MATERIAL IS:

The object appeared to be of a yellow color and a little larger than a basketball. It was seen for about 15 seconds. The object started to move very fast and finally disappeared. 

This object was observed by three persons - a Mrs. Lashbrook, her son Dale, and a girl friend of Dale's. Mrs. Lashbrook told me that she and the others were outside and saw the object in the sky. At first, she thought it was an airplane, but as it started to move very fast she realized it was not an airplane. All three watched the object until it disappeared.

Mrs. Lashbrook stated that to the best of her knowledge the object was hovering and then started to move very fast. It was not making any noise and disappeared suddenly. Mrs. Lashbrook stated that she would be willing to sign an affidavit about what she saw.

I would think they were traveling almost the same speed as an airplane, but without any motor noise. They did not see any trail or exhaust from the object.

This is the best I can account for it - I just thought I would send you the information in a case you might be interested in it.

CIVILIAN OBSERVATION OF A SINGULAR AIR OBJECT
1. Location: TRENTON, NEW JERSEY
2. Date-Time Group: 7/14/52 - 2225
3. Description of Object(s):
The object was described as a bright light, sharply outlined and lighted in the center, appearing to be about the size of "half the moon" and giving the impression of great distance. It approached from the northeast, passing overhead and continuing on out to the southwest in a very high speed of flight. It was accompanied by a single, smaller object which was illuminated but not as brightly as the large one.
4. Action Taken: Reported to the Air Force.
5. Additional Information: The person who reported this sighting states that he was watching the sky and saw this object appear without warning. He says that it was of sufficient size, brilliance and speed to definitely attract his attention. He feels quite certain that this was no conventional aircraft. 
6. Evaluation: This sighting has been investigated and appears to be of a highly unusual nature which cannot be readily explained on the basis of known aerial phenomena. The size, speed, and unusual mode of illumination of the object sighted would seem to preclude the possibility of its being an ordinary aircraft, meteor or other natural phenomena.

NOTE: THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS INFORMATION AFFECTING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ESPIONAGE ACT, 50 U.S.C. STRICT LAWS PROHIBIT ITS TRANSMISSION OR THE REVELATION OF ITS CONTENTS IN ANY MANNER TO AN UNAUTHORIZED PERSON, AS WELL AS ITS USE IN ANY MANNER PREJUDICIAL TO THE SAFETY OR INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES. ITS TRANSMISSION OR THE REVELATION OF ITS CONTENTS IN ANY MANNER TO AN UNAUTHORIZED PERSON IS PROHIBITED BY LAW, EXCEPT BY PERMISSION OF THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, USAF.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM:
STATION:

Trenton, NJ

PAGE  6  OF  7  PAGES

The report begins by stating that the witness did not wish to be identified. It then describes the witness's observations of unidentified objects in the sky. The witness reported seeing several objects that appeared to be airplanes, but they did not have any lights and were making no noise. The witness thought the objects could have been some type of military craft or experimental aircraft.

The report then states that the witness did not get a very good look at the objects, but they appeared to be some type of aircraft. The witness was unable to get a photograph of the objects.

The report concludes with a brief summary of the investigation, noting that this is the only case of its kind reported in the area during the time period.
