AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: 4506th ALP Base Group, Headquarters
McGuire Air Force Base, Trenton, NJ

REPORT NO.
IR-39-528

PAGE 7 OF 7 PAGES

(Some text appears to be blacked out/redacted)

I would judge all witnesses to be fairly reliable in reporting what they thought they saw. However, I would like to emphasize the fact that none of the witnesses possessed any previous experience which would qualify them as reliable observers. I have been a member of my branch of the Armed Services for 17 years.

Mr. (blacked out) works for a used car dealer in Bordentown as bookkeeper. The other three were casual laborers, two in a household.

On the knowledge I now possess concerning all witnesses I would give the report a G-3 rating. I would judge the witnesses to be fairly reliable and the report to be possibly true.

STATEMENT BY JOSEPH H. KING

I have coordinated with S/Sgt Washburn during all phases of this investigation and concur with his evaluation of the information and with his judgment in regard to the reliability of the sources.

Report of Investigation of Unidentified Objects Sighted in the Air over
Pendennis on 22 July and 23 July 1952. Report Center by S/Sgt. Daniels, Investigator

On 25 July 1952 at approximately 1100 hours I received instructions to investigate a report of unidentified objects sighted in the area. After coordination with Major Woods in Wing Intelligence, Headquarters 4602d Air Base Group, the undersigned immediately by telephone and received a brief description of the sightings, confirmed via electrical transmission according to instructions in AF Form 112.

At about 1900 hours 25 July 1952 I interviewed and interrogated all witnesses at the Trenton Naval Station. The following is a summary:

"Tuesday night July 22nd I saw four lighted objects flying in the sky. They were of amber color. The first three were like tumbling, the last one was lower. The first one came from the west to southwest, the last one was lower. The fourth came directly overhead, one went northwest the other southwest, the fourth the largest one ending near north. These objects came at different intervals about 9:45 - 10:15 - 11 P.M. They were to take a strategic course. Two came from a 2 to 3 miles, or so from my area. I could see they did not stop but appeared to keep on swirling. In a statement, I began to see, they were coming, but not observed around these objects. It was a very clear starlight night. This is my statement how I seen and they appeared to me.

This statement also was my own story of events written above.

CONTINUED BY M.

"On Tuesday night July 22nd I saw five lighted objects flying in the sky. In comparison they were quite a bit larger than the first. By turning and pointing the first one and I quickly spotted it sailing thru the sky towards me. The first came from almost perfect formation directly from the North and separated and one came diagonally west and the other came nearly west. The next two also came prominently from the north and both landed in south west direction. I should say they were in 20 and 25 miles an hour. They were about 3,245 until about 20,15 till 11:30. They also were mailed in a straight course - The night was very clear and the weather was calm bright.

To Whom it May Concern:

On Tuesday evening, July 22, between ten and twelve, the neighbors called
me and I came over. I saw three objects, I distinctly believe such a thing
was possible. By binoculars and I went out in the yard. In a few minutes they
called my attention to another one. It was near the west, just what appeared to be a large light or object, coming from the North,
and going in a direction South, in the direction of Philadelphia. It was moving
at great speed. Type 300 miles an hour) and there was no sound at all. It
gave you very strange feeling to see it. About three-quarters of the objects
were going from the South and headed North. Some of the very same objects, there
one came, then two traveling together and finally a fourth one.

[Conversation transcript with names redacted]

Q/3rd Washburn: The objects appeared to be of surface color and a little brighter.

Q/3rd Washburn: Can you give any idea as to the size?
[Respondent]: The size varied - the first three were about the same size as a basketball, with the fourth one was more like a grapefruit. Can't call of course.

Q/3rd Washburn: Can you tell me in what direction the objects were travelling?
[Respondent]: Well, I think the first ones came from the north and went northwest. They got crossed, then they separated - one went southwest and the other northwest. The last one I saw was directly above.

Q/3rd Washburn: How far. So you think the objects were travelling, huh?
[Respondent]: I would think they were travelling about the same speed as the average commercial aircraft. We saw passing over at almost any hour of the day or night.

Q/3rd Washburn: How many did you observe each object in its travel?
[Respondent]: Well, I would guess that we watched each one from three to five minutes. I wasn't timing that long.

Q/3rd Washburn: Do you think there was any set interval in the time the objects appeared?
[Respondent]: Yes, it seemed to me that they came over in about approximately twenty-minute intervals.

Q/3rd Washburn: Give me some idea as to how the objects appeared to you.
[Respondent]: Well, they looked to me as though they might have been changing in the sky, just sailing along, and the second and third one seemed to travel in more type of formation.

Q/3rd Washburn: How many objects did you see?
[Respondent]: Oh, I thought I saw five.

Q/3rd Washburn: You know your companions report seeing only four of those objects, while you report seeing five. How do you account for that?
[Respondent]: There is no way I can account for it - I just thought I saw five.

Q/3rd Washburn: Were the objects flying in an arc, a straight course, in a dive, or what?

END OF INVESTIGATION

SUMMARY

The next item to appear in this report of investigation will be a brief summary of everything I have discovered in the course of the investigation and the various impressions that I have formed.

On the night of 22 July 52 these six witnesses apparently observed several objects initially large then a few traveling through the sky. The objects were reported to have been strange colored and all of them seem to have been traveling at about the same speed as a large commercial airliner. All observers support that the objects appeared from the north and traveled south, northeast, southwest. Five of the six observers claimed to have seen four objects, while one observer claims to have seen five. The descriptions given by all observers appear to be quite accurate. In fact they all 212 tactical photographic parallel one another. The time of the first sighting was approximately 2145 hours.

The statements of Mrs. [redacted] appears to be quite different from the statements of the other witnesses. [Remainder of paragraph partially obscured]
