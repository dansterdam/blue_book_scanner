ATTN: Project ARVID

1. The following information is in self-reaction of information furnished
initially to form 164 and 17 June 1954, and, also, a preliminary summary
by our command in accordance with instructions outlined in paragraph 7, AFR
10-6.

2. On 18 June 1954, at approximately 1930 hours, this office was requested
by the Provost Marshal, Air Force Missile Test Center, to contact the Air Force
Missile Test Center Intelligence Officer, reporting the sighting of unidentified flying objects near Jacksonville, Florida.

3. On 18 June 1954, Major J. C. SMALLEY, Intelligence Branch, AFMTC,
advised that on 11 June 1954, between 2130 and 2200 hours, two civilian, CA Service,
residents of Melbourne, Florida, looking out over the Atlantic scene, east of Neptune Hall,
Jacksonville, Florida. The weather was overcast, with intermittent showers,
an intense white beam, brighter than a flashlight beam, but approximately the
same size as a large flashlight beam, was noted sliding from a point of approximately 100 yards offshore. The light flashed intermittently four (4) 
seconds and rotated clockwise for approximately 10 cycles. After an approximate
three (3) minute interval, the light began to cycle again for approximately 10
yards. The witnesses stated the overall color of the light was white, and the
spotlight was in the area of the lights. At this time, the light quit cycling and
nothing would be seen. The lights did not reoccur after the spotlight was
turned off. A check of the local radar did not indicate any unusual activity approximately 40 feet of water at the site of the above occurrence at the time it
occurred.

4. On 18 June 1954, this office was requested to interview circumstances
surrounding an entry in the Air Police Sergeant's log, concerning base
activity at an unspecified area on 16 June 1954, between 2130 and 2200 hours.

Object sighted at 4:15 hours appeared to be at 1,000 ft. Altitude, over the
Vero Beach NAS transmitter, at 10 statute miles northwest. The observer
to weather delay was not able to make detailed observations. No occurrence
records reflect to aircraft close to 50 per-mile in the area of sighting at
the time of the sighting. Gyro 9 at 1015, previously referred to, was not
operational. Attack adj. added to the following information is contained a
the weather observer's report for 16 June 1954:

Observation made at 2129 hours, EST
Scattered clouds at 4,000 feet
Winds at 12,000 feet
Visibility - 15 miles
Wind - SSW at 5 miles per hour
Altimeter - 29.860 inches
Weather balloon raised at 2200 hours
Wind at 1,000 ft. altitude - 270 at 12 miles per hour
Wind at 4,000 ft. altitude - 354 at 18 miles per hour

7. On 17 June 1954, this office was advised by Major WESLEY, P. MOSELEY,
10590A, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, at 0525 hours, 16 June 1954,
he sighted an unidentified aerial object from the aircraft parking ramp,
adjacent to the southwest corner of Hangar 300, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.
MOSELEY called to airman from Base operations to witness the object. These two
(2) airmen were: HYRAM D. KELLY, AFA, AF14-144-280, and JAMES W. DUNCAN, AF14-
144-280, both of 3850th Air Base Group, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.

The object was first sighted 35% of MOSELEY, at a 20 degree angle of elevation,
and as a bright light moving in a northerly direction. The object moved northward to a position directly west of observers, at an angle of elevation of
30-60 degrees. The object traveled a general northerly course during this
seven and a half period. The wind was light at 5 miles per hour. The
rate of speed was greater than that of an aircraft. The color of the object
was a blue fluorescent, changing intermittently to white. No discernible features
were visible, no sound was heard, and no trail or exhaust was visible. The
light blinked continuously and at regular intervals. The object appeared to climb
in a northwest direction after the stop directly west of Patrick AFB. The object
appeared to continue to climb and was visible until obscured by cloud coverage
at 0015 hours, EST, 17 June 1954. The object appeared to be several times
larger than the brightest visible star. A full moon was visible in the sky also.
