OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES
SUBJECT: McClellan Subcommittee Statement Concerning Handling of UFO Reports

1. Reference is made to your memorandum of 28 February 1958, subject as above.

2. The reason for the delay in my reply is that considerable exploratory work has been done with the Committee and the staff relative to your suggestion. However, the general attitude of the Committee is that while they feel it is not worthwhile to invest further time and money in this area, plus the fact that the Air Force is conducting its own investigation, they will not make a release to the effect at this time.

3. In cases of this type, we have found that Congressional Committees are not prone to commit themselves in the way you suggest. Therefore, while the Committee's attitude now is that they are not going to pursue this matter further, they have indicated that at a later date they would not want to be shackled by a press release indicating that they had no further interest in the matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE LIAISON

SUBJECT: McClellan Subcommittee Statement Concerning Air Force Handling of UFO Reports

1. Investigators for the McClellan Subcommittee (the Senate Committee on Investigating Government Operations) recently held informal discussions (31 January 1954) with us concerning the advisability of conducting public hearings on the Air Force's position regarding unidentified flying objects. The thing they were concerned with most was the charge that the Air Force was withholding information on this subject. I am sure we convinced them that this was not the case, as they have since indicated there is no need for hearings on this subject.

2. In view of these findings, based upon their preliminary informal investigation, this office would like to see the McClellan Subcommittee issue a statement certifying that a preliminary investigation by the Committee proved that the Air Force is properly conducting its investigation of unidentified flying objects and is not withholding information on this subject from the public. If possible, the statement should include that the Air Force has a definite public information plan in effect concerning unidentified flying objects.

3. Request SAFL review the possibility and/or feasibility of obtaining such a statement from the McClellan Subcommittee.

[Signed]
ARNO H. LUEHMAN

MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES, SAPS

SUBJECT: Congressional Public Hearings - Unidentified Flying Objects

1. Major Donald Keyhoe of the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena has been badgering the members of the McClellan Subcommittee, the Senate Committee on Investigating Government Operations, to hold open hearings on the question of the existence of unidentified flying objects.

2. In this regard investigators for the subcommittee contacted SAPFL and a meeting was held on 31 January 1958 at 1000 hours in Mr. Horner's office on the Air Force's position regarding possible hearings. Members of the committee attending this meeting were:

Mr. William Weitzen, Deputy for Research & Development Operations

Lt. Colonel William R. Kelzo, SAPFRD

Major Joseph E. Boland, SAPFL

Major James F. Byrne, AFCIN

Major Lawrence J. Tacker, SAPIS

Mr. Donald O'Donnell, FBI (Committee Investigator)

Mr. Jack Healey, FBI (Committee Investigator)

3. The committee's investigators simply asked if the Air Force desired such hearings. Mr. Weitzen stated that he did not see the need for it but would cooperate in every way possible if the committee thought the hearings necessary. Mr. Jack Healey stated that he wanted a definite Air Force position. Mr. Weitzen said he would have to wait until Mr. Horner returned but thought Mr. Horner would agree with his statement that we would cooperate in every way. The two investigators were invited to visit ATIC at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for background information. They said they would do so if hearings were developed.

4. There will be a meeting of this group again this week when
Mr. Horner returns and gives his views.

5. Major Tacker pointed out during the discussions that OIS
was providing the publicity at the present time on this subject at
the request of AFOIN. He stated he would continue to do so and
would cooperate in every way with the staff agencies concerned or
with the congressional committee if hearings are held.
