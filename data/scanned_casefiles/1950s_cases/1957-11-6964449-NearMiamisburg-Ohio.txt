Rocket Seen, Astronomy Unit Says

The rocket of Sputnik I was seen by a number of Miami Valley observers last night, according to F. E. Sutter, president of the Miami Valley Astronomical Society.

Sutter said "the rocket passed low in the western sky about 20 degrees off the horizon. It went above Venus and below the moon."

It passed in a northwest to southwest direction at 8:22 p.m. and Kenneth E. Kissell, chairman of the society's satellite tracking committee, also said, "It was visible for a minute and may have been longer. We first sighted it at 8:22:05 and were still watching it as 8:23:05." From data gathered from sightings during the past two evenings, Kissell predicted the rocket would be visible tonight about 8:27. It is expected to be about 10 degrees off the western horizon.

The Cincinnati Astronomical Observatory said that tonight may be the final chance for United States observers to see the rocket. The observatory has predicted the rocket will fall in the atmosphere sometime during the second week of December.

Sutter and Kissell both said that the location of Sputnik I is unknown, although Sutter said the rocket is now ahead of the satellite. The rocket in Sputnik I has been digital for some time.
