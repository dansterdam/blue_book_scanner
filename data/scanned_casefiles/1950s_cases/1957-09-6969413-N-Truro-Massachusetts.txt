In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object which you saw, so that when it was placed up in the sky it would give the same appearance as the objects which you saw. How close could your construction come to the actual objects which you saw?

41. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object which you saw, so that when it was placed up in the sky it would give the same appearance as the objects which you saw. How close could your construction come to the actual objects which you saw?

I am afraid that I could not construct any model that would accurately represent what I saw. The objects I observed were very unusual and I have no way to recreate their appearance. They were definitely unlike any known aircraft or objects that I am familiar with. This is why I felt compelled to report the sighting, as it was a very strange and unexplainable occurrence.

42. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this? (Circle one) Yes No. If you answered no, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

Yes

43. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what's might have caused it?

The object was extremely unusual and I do not have any explanation for what it could have been or what might have caused it. It did not resemble any known aircraft or object that I am aware of. I am perplexed by this sighting and can only speculate as to its nature and origin.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sky chart or diagram depicting the positions of the planets Venus and Saturn in the night sky. The chart shows the relative positions of the two planets as well as other celestial objects like constellations and stars.

ASTRONOMY

VENUS, SATURN NOW SEEN

Although Venus is becoming brighter in the evening sky, it is still reddish from view. September will bring about a kind of replacement for Venus - the "harvest moon."

BY JAMES STOKLEY 

THE PLANET Venus is gradually increasing in brightness as seen in the western sky just after sunset, but it will not reach its greatest brilliance until late in October. This is because the planet is getting farther from the Earth and the sun, so that more and more of its illuminated hemisphere is turned toward us.

As this occurs, the planet will soon appear of magnitude minus 3.5, which means it will be one of the brightest objects in the sky, outshining the star Sirius, which is the brightest star. Venus will then take the place of the star called Sirius, which is so much dimmer that it will be considerably overpowered.

Accompanying Venus in the evening sky, as shown in the diagram, will be the planet Saturn, which is now well up in the southeast as evening falls. Saturn is yellow in color and has not nearly the brilliance of Venus.

The first planet to be seen in the evening is Jupiter, which appears in the southwest in the early evening hours. It is brightest early in the month, becoming dimmer as it approaches the sun and is lost from view by the end of the period.

During the early evening Saturn is in the southern sky, but it moves westward throughout the night and can be seen in the west about 9:30 p.m. this time of year, by your kind of standard time.

September's Morning Star

Brightest star of the September evening is Vega, in Lyra, which reaches its highest point about midnight. This group is also called the "Northern Cross," for one of the shapes it forms in the sky. Toward the southwest, one comes to Aquila, the eagle, of which Altair is the brightest star.

Many of the first magnitude stars, as well as the planets Jupiter and Saturn, are also shown on the diagram. These are so bright that they can be seen even in the light of the evening twilight.

Just to the northwest is the figure of Hercules, the kneeling giant, and then higher up is the great square of Pegasus, the winged horse. Cassiopeia, the woman, is in the northeast, with her "W" shape. Cepheus, the king, is nearby, and if you follow the curve of the handle of the "Big Dipper" it will lead you to Capella, in Auriga, the charioteer, which is very bright.

This night and the next will be 24 minutes less than the night that preceded them and the nights after will continue to get shorter, until the "harvest moon" is reached when the nights and days are nearly equal.

In Canada, according to an astronomy published in 1932, explaining why, this is the time when the farmer is most busy reaping his crops, accounting for the name "harvest moon."

This is the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox, which takes place September 23 this year. The full moon is at its highest for the whole year, and so gives the most light to the farmer for his labors in the fields at that season. The moon rises about twenty minutes later each night from about September 9 to about September 23, so that for several nights around the harvest moon the moon rises at nearly the same time - just a little after sunset. This makes it particularly useful to the farmer in getting the crops in.

Hunter's Moon

In October conditions will be quite similar, except that the moon will have less delay in rising from one night to the next. This is known as the "Hunter's moon," since the bright moonlight at that time aids the hunter in getting his game. The brightness and early rising of the full moon at that season were important factors in the preparation for the long winter ahead.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

23 September 1957
Old Greenwich, Connecticut

II: Plane Spotter Watches Odd-Shaped Object(s) Eject "Silvery Stuff"

At about 5:20 p.m. on Saturday, September 28, 1957, Mrs. B. and her 7-year old daughter were having sandwiches in the back yard of their hilltop home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Mrs. B., while gazing over Long Island Sound to the west, was suddenly attracted by a small plane flying over Long Island Sound to the northeast. She said it was flying in an unusual manner with a dipping, fluttering motion, and at one point it appeared to eject or expel some "silvery stuff" from the rear. At about the same time she noticed a strange, shiny object in the sky just to the east of the moon, which through the binoculars appeared to be a large inflated balloon, translucent in color and slowly drifting to the northeast. 

Just at that moment the object moved off to the right, described a wide horizontal arc, and then returned to its original position, repeating this maneuver two or three times, each time more slowly and drifting motionless again for fifteen or twenty seconds, during which time Mrs. B. had it in view through her binoculars. The connecting delivery strands were wavy, as though in a slight wind. While the small plane was maneuvering, Mrs. B. said she had the distinct impression that the two objects were in some manner related or connected.

After a short while the connection seemed to break, and the shiny object began drifting more rapidly to the northeast. Mrs. B. described the object as silvery, round, and somewhat larger than a basketball. It was clearly visible, not blurred or indistinct, but Mr.---(deleting name) who was also watching it from the house, said that the object described a third circle like its earlier maneuvers and then seemed to dwindle to a spot through the clear sky, and was out of sight within a few seconds.

Mrs. B., whose distance vision is excellent, had also noted the selection of the delivery material, which she saw begin to float downwards in vertical strands. She compared the appearance to a "delivery sparks" of an exploding object, but Mr.---(deleting name) thought it was merely a "tail streamers" attached to the silvery object. It is possible that a small balloon may have been used as a carrier for the "silver stuff," which may have been some kind of experimental observation instrument or apparatus. The object was clearly visible for quite a long time, Mrs. B. said, but did not see it again. She asked her husband if his wife had ever mentioned it to him, he had said no. This object appeared to her to be intelligently controlled, but she is quite convinced that if his wife had ever mentioned it to him, he had paid no attention, as she found him quite uninterested in the matter. (This is a delicate point, as the attitude of witnesses may be suspect.)

Neither the aircraft nor the UFO had disappeared. Two saucer-shaped jets, possibly Vulcans, passed over heading southwards and climbing. Later other jets were seen to join them. The movements of the aircraft and the UFO jet seemed to Mrs. B. possibly coordinated but the significance, if any, she did not attempt to interpret.

No conclusions could be drawn. (Neither by Mrs. B. nor the investigators.) The type of object seen by Mrs. B. and her daughter is, of course, uncertain and may have been of a conventional nature. But after discussing it with the research section there was general agreement that it is not proper to accept this as an ordinary sighting until more details and information come to hand concerning whatever it is they do with that angel hair--maybe refueling each other--and that it appeared more animal than mineral. This certainly seems acceptable. Some of the material was subsequently found, and would suggest that there may have been an observational basis for at least two UFOs.

Science News Letter for August 24, 1957

Strange Tiny Tempests on Air Bases?

STRUCTURAL FAILURE of the "skin" around missile-launching devices at rocket bases may be due to tiny tempests, or "tiny tornadoes," caused by the launching of rockets and missiles, according to reports received by the University of Michigan Institute of Science and Technology.

The motion is very similar to that of ocean tides, the paper said. The force working to produce structural failure is a wave motion set up directly by the rocket exhaust. The vibrations and wave motions are too rapid and too intense to be picked up by ordinary anemometers and instruments that measure winds and air currents. The effects, however, have been indicated by damage to "skin" structures, the paper said.

Chemists Develop Most Sensitive Test for DNA

RAPID and convenient detection of minute amounts of DNA and RNA has been developed by chemists at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, reported the Science News Letter. DNA is the carrier of heredity in living cells.

The new method, which is an order of magnitude more sensitive than any previous test, depends on the fluorescence that occurs when a fluorescent dye combines with these biological molecules. Using this method, the Wisconsin chemists claim they can detect as little as one-billionth of a gram of DNA or one-ten-billionth of a gram of RNA.

Narcotics from Pistol Subdues Sharks in Sea

FOUR HUNDRED pounds of seconal, a barbiturate sedative known as a "goofball," were needed to subdue two sharks caught off Long Island recently, according to Dr. Perry W. Gilbert of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., who reported on the incident.

The sharks and their livers were brought back to shore for a study of mating habits and of all the tranquilizers and narcotics known to man. Harpoons fired from a pistol into the sharks were the method of delivering the drug, which takes effect in about 30 seconds. The drug acts as a general anaesthetic, sedating or paralysing the sharks completely. After about 30 minutes the effects wear off and the sharks recover fully. No harm to the sharks results from the drug, it was reported.

New Concept of "Pipe" Microwave Radio Signals

A NEW method of transmitting microwave radio signals through tubes and conduits instead of through air has been developed, according to the Science News Letter.

The new method, called "waveguide transmission," can handle up to 1,000 times the microwave power and carry signals over very much greater distances through tubes and conduits than can be achieved through air, the report stated.

Microwaves, which are very short radio waves, are precisely tuned to the size of the conducting tube or pipe and are fed into one end. The pipe or tube then carries the waves precisely down the tube. The waves must be tuned or matched to the tube size, changes in temperature, and must be adjusted periodically.

Dr. Simon Ramo, of the Hughes Research and Development Center, says this new "pipe transmission" of microwaves will eventually be used for many purposes, including coast-to-coast television and telephone transmission, according to the Science News Letter report.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a celestial map and an article discussing how the stars were brighter in the past according to astronomers. The article mentions that the stars were believed to be billions of years old, and discusses various theories about the formation and evolution of the stars.

Science News Letter for August 24, 1957

EARLY STARS WERE BRIGHTER
astronomers to believe that billions of years ago the stars were much brighter than they now are.

THE SKIES were adorned with much brighter stars billions of years ago, according to astronomers, but the light they gave off then was much faster than their light is today - and the reason for this change is a matter of dispute. 
The observation that the stars are a little dimmer than they once were was reported by astronomers at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Chicago. The data indicates that in the four or five billion years that have elapsed, the stars have lost a significant amount of element building occurring in their interiors.

Some process is repeated in the more mature galaxies, similar to one that was formed so early in the life span of the stars billions of years ago. Although the problem of accounting for the change in intrinsic stellar brightness is a thorny one, satisfactory explanation of it has been proposed.

The spectrum or "fingerprint" of starlight reveals that stars are composed largely of the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium. Over billions of years the heavier elements have built up within the stars through nuclear processes going on in their interiors. This steady accumulation of elements in the stars has caused a small but steady dimming of their light.

The various nuclear processes, such as fusion, which generate the energy powering the stars, build up elements heavier than hydrogen and helium - elements like carbon, oxygen, silicon and iron. This buildup has the effect of reducing the star's luminosity or brightness over the span of billions of years.

Thus, as the stars age, their light becomes a little dimmer, just as a smoldering fire gradually loses its brightness as it converts fuel into ash. The astronomers reported that this process accounts for at least some of the observed fading of the stars.
