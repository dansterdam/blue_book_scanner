SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for August 24, 1957

ASTRONOMY

Venus, Saturn Now Seen
Although Venus is becoming brighter in the evening sky, it is still retiring early from view. September will have a kind of replacement for Venus—the "harvest moon."

By JAMES STOKLEY

▶ THE PLANET Venus is gradually brightening, and becoming more prominent in the evening sky. However, it will soon appear, of magnitude minus 3.5 on the astronomical brightness scale, at constellation Virgo, the virgin, and close to the star called Spica, which is so much fainter that it will be considerably more difficult to leave.

The accompanying maps are drawn to show the appearance of the evening sky at about 10:30 p.m., your kind of standard time—add one hour for daylight-saving time—at the first of the month, an hour earlier at the middle and two hours earlier as September gives way to October. Thus, Venus does not appear upon them.

They do, however, show the second planet Saturn, which stands in the constellation of Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer.

During the early evening Saturn is in the southern sky, but it moves toward the west as the evening advances. At the beginning of the month, around 10:30 p.m. by your kind of standard time.

Brightest star of the September evening is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre, high in the west. Directly overhead in Cygnus, the swan, is another bright star, Deneb, also called the Northern Cross. Moving down from Cygnus toward the southwest comes the first magnitude star Altair, the eagle, of which Altair is the brightest.

Three other stars which, like these, are of the first magnitude, are also shown on the maps. These are all so near the horizon that they appear considerably fainter than if they were high overhead.

The map shows the sky at different times of year. On Sept. 9, we find that the moon will rise at 8:40 p.m. and set at 6:40 a.m. the next morning. It did on the eighth.

Next March, on the other hand, the difference will be much greater.

The moon will be full on the fifth and the difference in time of moonrise, between that night and the next, will be 74 minutes.

Thus, in September, and October, when the moon is full and bright, it rises about the same time for several evenings.

Harvest Moon for Farmers

As John Ferguson wrote in a book on astronomy published in 1757, explaining why this is called the harvest moon:

"The farmers gratefully ascribe the early rising of the full moon at that time of year to the goodness of God, not doubting that He had ordered it so on purpose to give them an immediate supply of moonlight after sunset, for their convenience in reaping the fruits of the earth."

The reason for the differences in the delay of moonrise from one night to the next is found in the changing angle made by the moon's path with the horizon, once a month; each night it is about a twenty-ninth of its circumference farther east.

Thus, being further east, it rises later—about 52 minutes on the average.

At this time of the year, the southern part of the ecliptic is in our evening sky—it passes through Sagittarius, the archer, and the line is not far from parallel to the horizon. Hence, the moon's daily eastward movement is utilized in moving it horizontally to a considerable degree. Just before sunrise, it is not much farther below the horizon than it was the night before. In March, on the other hand, the ecliptic is nearly vertical, and the same eastward movement of the moon takes that body considerably farther below the horizon, thus making the greater changes at moonrise.

Hunter's Moon

In October, conditions will be quite similar to what they are in September. Again the moon will rise from one night to the next when it is full. This is again on the eighth, and it will rise only 30 minutes later on the ninth. This is called the "hunter's moon."

28 September 1957
Old Greenwich, Connecticut

No Case (Information Only)

II: Plane Spotter Watches Odd-Shaped Object(s) Eject "Silvery Stuff"

At about 2:40 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 28, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] were having sandwiches in the back yard of their home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Mrs. [redacted], a valued CSI member and an experienced OOC plane-spotter, had her 7 x 50 binoculars out and was examining a small plane flying over Long Island Sound to the south, when her husband commented that there was something in the sky above the plane. To the naked eye it was a small but definite silvery disc, about 1/20 the size of the moon.

Instead, the glasses showed him something of puzzling shape "like an upside-down parachute." Unable to make out just what this was, he recalled the binoculars to his wife. Just at that moment the object moved off to the right, described a wide horizontal circle, and returned to its former position in the south-southwest, about 35° above the horizon. After a few seconds, it repeated the maneuver. After this it was motionless again for fifteen or twenty seconds, during which time Mrs. [redacted] in view through the binoculars. The accompanying sketch shows what she saw. The objects resembled frosted glass and appeared to be spinning. The connecting silvery strands were wavy, as shown. While she was watching, two smaller white objects rapidly crossed the field, but these were not clearly seen. Suddenly, something like silvery sparks "exploded" out of the top of the object, or pair of objects, and almost at once it moved suddenly off to the right. Trying to follow it with the glasses, she caught the sun and was temporarily blinded, but it was clear that the object described a third circle like its own previous ones, terminating at the time with an abrupt and final vertical ascent.

The object dwindled as it rose through the clear sky, and was out of sight in a few seconds.

Mr. [redacted], whose distance vision is excellent, had also noted the ejection of the silvery material, which he saw begin to float downwards as vertical strands, glittering in the sun. He compared the appearance of these glittering strands to "spider web." It drifted away from them toward the south and was not visible very long. His wife was entirely absorbed in the object itself and did not see it. She asked her husband whether it might have been smoke or cloud-mist (like a jet contrail), but he was definite about the comparison to spiders. Mr. [redacted] had never heard of "angel hair" if his wife had ever mentioned it to him, he had paid no attention. So she found that the term conveyed nothing to him. His visual impressions were therefore entirely uninfluenced by suggestion or expectation. (He has taken very little interest in saucers hitherto.)

A few minutes after the UFO had disappeared, two red swept-wing jets, possibly Vulcans, passed over heading southward and climbing. Later other jets were seen to the south. Whether the unusual jet activity was provoked by the UFO isn't known.

No more intelligent, trustworthy, and non-credulous witnesses than Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] could be desired. (Neither had ever seen a UFO before.) They have, of course, wondered whether what they saw might be explainable as some unusual type of balloon, but after discussing it with the Research Section there was general agreement that it is pretty safe to accept this as an authentic UFO sighting.

Mrs. [redacted] felt that with the same two UFOs doing whatever it is they do with that angel hair--maybe refueling each other--and that it appeared "more animal than mechanical." This certainly seems acceptable. Some of us would go a bit further, and would suggest that we may have here an observation of the mating of two UFOs.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for August 24, 1957

E FIELDS
ARCHAEOLOGY
Ancient Toltec Colony
Found in Western Mexico

> A PREVIOUSLY unknown Toltec colony has been discovered on the west coast of Mexico, representing the westward limit of expansion of this ancient civilization.

The site has been officially explored for the first time by an expedition from the University of California at Los Angeles, under the direction of Dr. Clement Meighan. The expedition was sponsored by Phil Berg, Los Angeles executive.

The colony was located near the coast highway near the city of Tepic. Dr. Meighan estimated the colony reached its cultural peak about 1200 A.D.

Richer examples of a higher degree of cultural achievement than had previously been thought to exist in this region during this period were also noted.

They include excellent examples of pottery of six-color decor, figurines, bronze axe-heads, copper pins and tweezers, and a wealth of other artifacts that would "make a basketball referee green with envy."

The pottery is described as being of high quality with exquisite patterns in six different colors. Much of the pottery seems to be art objects rather than utilitarian items. Some of it was apparently used only in connection with burial rites.

CHEMISTRY
Chromium Chemical
Makes Ruby Redness

> SCIENTISTS have found why the redness of rubies comes from a green chemical compound of the same metal chromium that is used to put glittering plating on auto bumpers.

Delving into the secrets of these fascinating jewels, Dr. E. F. Osgood of the department of theoretical chemistry, at Britain's University of Cambridge, describes his research on rubies in Nature (June 29).

Most jewels are really a "solid solution" of chromium oxide in aluminum oxide, making jewels "contaminated minerals," and the color of the jewel is very close to the color of the metal compound dissolved in its matrix.

The case of rubies, the effect is just the opposite. Chromium oxide, a green chemical, dissolved in an aluminum oxide matrix, a colorless or white substance, gives not a green stone but a red ruby.

Dr. Osgood, investigating this property, made use of the fact that synthetic rubies could be made only if the chromium content of the indeed aluminum oxide was now eight percent. Above this, the ruby would become green-colored.

Measurements of the minute distances between the atoms in red rubies and "green rubies" showed that above eight percent chromium, the chemical structure literally "squeezes" the chromium atoms and the aluminum atoms so that the color of chromium to show through.

Below eight percent, the tight aluminum oxide crystal structure literally "squeezes" the chromium atoms, shortening the iron-chromium distance and causing the shift in color from green to red.

ENGINEERING
Study Tiny Tempests on
Aircraft, Missile "Skin"

> STRUCTURAL FAILURE of the "skin" of aircraft and missiles traveling at supersonic speeds may be due to tiny tempests that rage over it.

This phenomenon, known as panel flutter, is the subject of research by John Miles, professor of engineering at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Panel flutter has been a suspect in certain structural failures ever since such defects were noticed in the first German V-2 rockets, Mr. Miles pointed out. But the causes of these failures were not known.

The action is very similar to that of ocean waves generated by high winds or the flutter of a flag. In fact the study has thrown new light on wave formation in the ocean.

The research is currently being worked out to assure that "skin" thickening does not pose a weight problem, a particularly critical area in missiles, Mr. Miles said.

CHEMISTRY
Chemists Develop Most
Sensitive Test for Metals

> A RAPID and convenient method for measuring the metal content of solutions has been developed. It is so sensitive it is possible to detect as little as one part of metal dissolved from the glass of an ordinary laboratory equipment.

Dr. Irving Shain, professor of chemistry, and Richard D. DeMars, research assistant at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, reported the new method which will allow detection of metals in very small parts of a solution. The basis of the technique is an electrode consisting of a tiny drop of mercury hanging from a platinum wire. Any metal that will react with mercury will show up.

Using this method, the Wisconsin chemists can measure concentrations as small as seven billionths of an ounce of lead or two billionths of an ounce of zinc in a quart of solution.

ICHTHYOLOGY
Narcotic From Pistol
Subdues Sharks in Sea

> FOUR HUNDRED pounds of ocean-swimming shark can be knocked out in one minute or less with a water pistol full of a narcotic known at M.S. 222, Dr. Perry W. Gilbert and F. G. Wood Jr. of Cornell University reported in Science (Aug. 29).

Large sharks and rays were needed for a study of mating habits and of all the tranquilizers and anesthetics tried, M.S. 222 worked best.

The large fish are brought alongside of the boat and their heads are pulled up out of the water. Then a solution of the narcotic is squirted into the mouth of a shark or the spiraeles of a ray and sprayed over the gill opening.

A water pistol, rubber-bulb syringe, or pump-type hand sprayer can be used, the authors report.

Within 15 seconds, the drug begins taking effect. The fish can then be safely handled for tagging or other purposes, first stages of recovery take place within 30 minutes after the shark is put back in the water. After that, the drug wears off gradually and completely, and the fish are unharmed.

TECHNOLOGY
New Conduit "Pipes"
Microwave Radio Signals

> "PIPING" SHORT radio waves around corners and sharp angles is expected to be made easier by a new lightweight "traveling-wave" conduit tube announced by the Radio Corporation of America.

One property of the very short radio waves of microwaves, measured in inches or less, is that they can be "piped" for short distances through tubes and conduits somewhat like water pipes. The new development of a high-sensitivity microwave conduit system is the result of research by RCA's David Sarnoff Research Center, directed by Dr. K. K. Chang.

Dr. Chang explained that the focusing of the "plug-in" traveling wave tube consists of two pairs of spiral windings. The larger outer pair carries the microwave energy, while the inner pair of smaller tubular electron beam and helps the outer pair in beam focusing.

Successful operation of the research stage. The traveling-wave tube was an electronic amplifier in airborne radar and countermeasures equipment as well as microwave communications systems.
