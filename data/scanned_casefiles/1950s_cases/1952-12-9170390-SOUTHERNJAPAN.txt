Southern Japan

I. Description of Incident:
From OISGZ to OHTC, an object was observed from an AFB in Southern Japan. Object appeared very similar to an evening star, was first yellow in color, but then changed to green and finally to red. Object was described by observers to be Ping-pong ball size at an estimated distance of 2000 yards to the south. However, when it finally disappeared below the horizon, it again assumed the original appearance of a star.
Weather in the locality was excellent. Radar attempted to pick the object up, but with no success.

II. Discussion of Incident:
Several factors in this sighting are significant. Primarily, the object was described by the observers themselves as "starlike". Secondly, the initial observation as well as the phenomenon of the changing colors is a well-known astronomical phenomena caused by seeing at great distances.  

III. Conclusion:
Probably astronomical.

AF FORM 112-PART II AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: T/O 527th AGD GROUP, APO 929
DATE: 11-7-52
SUBJECT: DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS
A star like white object, changing direction in a strange erratic course, was observed by an Air Force radar station watch for 0930-1010 hours. The object appeared suddenly at 0930 and disappeared at 1010 hours. It traveled in an easterly direction at an estimated speed of 300-400 knots. The object was visible to the naked eye and was under observation by radar and optical means during the entire period.

OBSERVATIONS:
a) Visual Phenomena: The object had a star like luster when first observed, then changed to a glowing object. It executed sudden turns, stops, and reverses. It zigzagged over an area of 30-35 miles.
b) Radar Phenomena: The object was picked up by radar and maintained very good contact throughout the observation. The general impression from radar observation was that the object was very small in size, possibly a reflection, as its radar return was much less than that of a B-29 aircraft. However, radar operators estimated its speed in excess of 300 knots.
c) Weather: Sky clear. Visibility to 10-15 miles. Wind direction 270 degrees, 5 knots.
d) Conclusion: Although the exact identity of the object could not be determined, the report suggests that it was probably a natural phenomena, as its behavior, both visually and by radar, is characteristic of a meteor or other type of abnormal celestial object.

P/I PEAF COMMENT: 
Reference IR-6-52, 527th AG & W Co., dtd 3 Nov 52. This sighting is similar and possible explanations are as follows:
a. Unidentifiable from surface vessels in the Tsushima Strait or from islands off the east coast of Kyushu.
b. Reflected images or stars or seen through the surface haze and smoke.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
I/O 527th ACW Group,

PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES

STATEMENT

A/2C F-center 92C to observe an area to the SE of our station at about 10 miles on an azimuth of 200 degrees at approximately 10,000 feet. He reported observing five (5) unidentified objects traveling at a high rate of speed. These objects were observed by the radar operator to be a formation of approximately 10 knots and the position of the formation was changing very rapidly. It was not observed on the radar by this operator.

It was yellow in color and very bright. Its movement was very erratic. It would dive and then rise with a very irregular motion. Its speed was estimated to be in excess of 500 mph. While making this observation A/2C Pentelk called this information into Hannah Control.

A/2C Ellis our radar maintenance man on duty also observed this object. It was approximately 0110Z further observation showed the object to be from about twenty (20) to twenty-five (25) miles to the SE of our station. Its coloration had now become a dull orange.

During all of this time the attitude of this object varied from medium to very high.

On the day of 14 December 1952 between the time 0201 and 0215I I saw the ball of light in the southern sky above the horizon. It was white in color with a blue-green tail. After approximately 2 minutes, it turned into an object which appeared to be about twenty (20) or twenty-five (25) miles distant with a heading from SE to NW. It was about twenty (20) seconds in duration. The object had a light, oscillating glow and the speed was such that it disappears rapidly below the horizon. The object, flight or whatever it was seemed to me to be some sort of intelligence-controlled apparatus inasmuch as it maneuvered erratically, hovered momentarily and then streaked swiftly below the horizon. There was nothing about its actions which indicated that of a aircraft.
