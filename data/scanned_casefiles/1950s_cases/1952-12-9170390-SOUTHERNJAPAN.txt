Southern Japan                                                   14 December 1952

I.  Description of Incident

From 0352 to 0402 an object was observed from an AFB in Southern Japan. Object appeared very similar to an evening star, was first yellow in color, but then intermittently turned orange. It was located low on the horizon at a 200° azimuth from the point of observation and appeared to be sinking slowly to the south. However, when it finally disappeared below the horizon, it again assumed the 200° bearing.

Weather in the locality was excellent. Radar attempted to pick the object up, but with no success.

II. Discussion of Incident

Several factors in this sighting are significant. Primarily, the object was described by the observers themselves as "starlike". Secondly, the initial observation as well as the final observation placed the unknown at a 200° azimuth. This indicates that the object probably was a star setting in a straight line downward in the SW. The changing color is a well-known phenomena caused by seeing at great distances.

III. Conclusion

Probably astronomical.

1. Description of Object: A star like bright object that
changed from a yellow to an orange color intermittently. Object
had no visible parallax system, trail or exhaust and was in
an erratic manner. Sweeperts took place in wet was estimated an
arc 10 degrees long. First moving vertically, then horizontally,
each time returning to its original point of departure. There
was no evidence of sound, and speed was estimated to be 300 Knots.
Object cast a beam of light on the water below it.

2. Time of Sighting: Object was sighted at 0350 and re-
mained in view at intervals until 0415. Time of sighting totaled
25 minutes.

3. Manner of Observation: Visual. Binoculars (7x50) were
used. Luminosity of the brightness of the object they were of no
great value.

4. Location of Observers: Three airmen observed object at
Iouisu Saki (Kure 1035). Object was at an azimuth of 200 rela-
tive to the Observer's true north. Altitude was estimated
during a 25 minute observation period. Altitude was estimated to
be at 2000 feet, when first observed. First to 4,000 feet, then
last seen descending below the horizon.

5. Identifying Information (Observers): Observers have two
radar contacts with the object. Radar and Edward Edwards
have been stationed at TowSu S-81 for at least 5 months, while
Airman Bills is a N.W. Airman. All were clear, reliable and
be steady, reliable and alert. There is also a high degree of coin-
cidence in their statement.

6. Weather: Sky clear, surface visibility: 6 to 10 miles with
haze and smoke; Surface wind: were east at 0 knots, as reported by
20-3 Weather Detachment, Itazuke Air Force Base.

7. Other Activity: None.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Interception or Identification: None attempted.

10. Air Traffic: No air traffic observed on radar scope or
visually during the period of report.

11. COMMENTS F PRELIMINARY OFFICER: This is the 2nd report of a sim-
ilar phenomenon observed at 520 52 (see IR-4-52, 11 Oct 52, 52nd
AC&W Gp). Over the same area by three different airmen. In addition
details of measurement observed at Fuji (WJED 5775) and Suburi Yora
(with 2226) (see IR-N6-52, 27 Oct 52). Further investigation of
similarity of observation. These incidents indicate the of character of a phenomenon common to area.

D/I FEAF COMMENT:

Reference IR-6-52, 527th AC & W Gp, dtd 3 Nov 52. This sighting is similar and possible explanations are as follows:

a. Searchlights from surface vessels in the Tsushima Straits or from the islands off the east coast of Kyushu.

b. Refracted images of stars as seen through the surface haze and smoke.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0350I on the morning of 14 December 1952 I was asked by
A/2c Pentek to observe an area to the SW of our station at about 10 miles on an
approximate heading of 200 degrees. I was told that he had made a visual sight-
ing on an unusual airborne object. All that was visible on the radar scope was
two (2) locally harbored fishing boats. These craft were observed by this operator
heading for the position that they were at, at a speed of approximately 10 knots.
I was further told that this object was changing position very rapidly. It was not
observed on the radar by this operators.

At approximately 0351I made a visual sighting and observed the same object.
It was yellow in color and very bright. Its movement was very erratic. It moved
first vertically and then horizontally, seemingly turning to its original position
each time. After observing this, I was forced to disregard my first opinion that
it was a star. I had never seen a celestial body move in the previously described
manner.

While I was making my observation A/2c Pentek called this information into
Hannah controller.

A/3C Ellis our radar maintenance man on duty also observed this object.

At approximately 0401I further observation by this operator showed the object
to be from about twenty (20) to twenty-five (25) miles to the SW of our station.
Its coloration had now become a dull orange.

During all of this time the altitude of this object varied from medium to
very high.

On the day of 14 December 1952 between the time 0356I and 0415I I saw the ball
of light, which was very bright, vary in its color from orange to yellow, which
could have been taken as being a star, except it had very erratic movement. When
I first saw it, it was about twenty (20) or twenty-five (25) miles in a heading
of about 200 degrees, away from our station. It was moving up and down, and then
from side to side with amazing high speed. There was a ball of light, such as
that of a spot light, going from it and striking the water. The object, light, or
whatever it was, was only visible for a few moments and then there was nothing.
It disappeared very abruptly beyond the horizon.

STATEMENT

On the morning of 14 December 1952 at 0350I I opened one of the windows of operations to get a breath of fresh air. It was at this time that I noticed a brilliantly yellow, glowing object hovering in the sky about 10 miles SW of where I stood, at approximately 200 degrees, and I estimate between 2 and 3 thousand feet. It appeared to be round, but due to its brightness it was hard to be sure. There was no noise or trail from this object and at first I thought it to be a star, until it began to move in a very erratic manner. First from right to left, and then up and down, varying as much as 7 to 10 degrees. All the time moving from this station. I notified the scope operator, (A/2C Edwards), and he reported nothing on the radar scope. I also took a visual on two objects and confirmed my sighting.

At 0351 I notified Hannah controller and passed this information on to him. While this was being done, our maintenance man, A/3C Mills, also took a sighting and pointed out that this object was casting a beam, similar to a stage spot lite, on the water below. I hadn't noticed this before as I was so intent on watching the object itself. As we watched the object, it moved away on a heading of approximately 200 degrees at an estimate speed of 300 knots, rising in altitude to approximately 20,000 feet and changing to a dull orange color as it neared the horizon.

At 0415I almost due south of this station, this object moved below the horizon and was lost to our view.
