CHAPTER I
PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM OPTICAL TRACKING
OF U. S. EARTH SATELLITES
by
J. Allan Hynek* and Fred L. Whipple**

In the satellite program of the International Geophysical Year, the optical satellite tracking program of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has played a role of major importance. The principal tasks include the visual acquisition of the artificial earth satellites, the computation of search ephemerides and predictions, the operation of a world-wide network of optical tracking cameras, the reception and analysis of incoming data, and last but not least, the dissemination of the results to the scientific community.

Remembering that since October 4, 1957, there has been a total of which objects have been launched into satellite orbits, we hardly need to point out that the efforts expended by thousands of persons, including the volunteer Moonwatch team members, in the Optical Tracking Program alone are outstanding. With great satisfaction, our staff members have participated in this undertaking, our staff members have participated in this under-taking, and we have been proud to play a normal call of duty.

The cooperation of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in furnishing us with critical prediction data for satellites has been exceptional. This has been of major importance. Also, the computation of ephemerides and orbital data would have been virtually impossible without the cooperation of the Computations Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.

The subsequent sections of this collection have been prepared individually by members of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory who are actively working in this particular field. This is a factual and informative account of the respective aspects of the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory, with regard to overall ground optical tracking program, the orbital data and results which we have been able to obtain with regard to satellites 1957 Alpha, 1958 Beta One, and 1959 Gamma.

The main-stay of the optical tracking program is the worldwide network of precision photographic stations. Each observing station is equipped with a 20-inch aperture, f/1 camera designed especially for the photographic tracking of artificial earth satellites. The optics for these cameras were designed by Dr. James Baker and constructed under the supervision of the Optical Corporation.

The system provides spherical surface in combination with a 31-inch concentric spherical mirrors, providing a usable field of 30Â°. The motor-driven mechanical drive provides sustained tracking of a satellite, and the film frame, in cyclical exposure, is designed so that many individual photographs can be obtained during a satellite pass, with the mechanical system designed by Mr. Joseph Nunn and fabricated by Boller and Chivens, Inc., all of South Pasadena, California.

The urgency imposed upon the optical tracking program by the launching of the artificial satellite made it desirable to expedite the construction of the stations and to conduct the auxiliary camera tests to go into operation before the arrival of the Baker-Nunn cameras. Through the excellent cooperation of the Ballistic Research Laboratory, we have obtained the use of two SM-8 (Small Missiles) Askania Theodolites, together with additional equipment necessary for the initial observations.

The full complement of Baker-Nunn cameras is expected to be in operation by mid June, thus making possible the completion of any smaller gaps in the tracking network. As discussed by Karl G. Henize in his report, the full complement of Baker-Nunn cameras is expected to be in operation by mid June.

The text describes the scientific value and tracking methods of the satellite program, as well as the successful photographs obtained and the international cooperation involved. There is no human face or identification visible in this image.

OCR text output:

For an artificial satellite to be tracked most effectively, for positions to be determined to the greatest accuracy, the tracking schedule must be of the order of 2 to 20 seconds of are and of 0.001 seconds of time. A several block schedule is necessitated by the operational requirements of the twelve observing stations. The time presentation within each camera is photographed on each frame.

It can be stated that the scientific value of a satellite for many geophysical purposes rises greatly with its longevity. Prediction oscfllations of various radio and optical signals, measurements of the earth's magnetic field at the satellite elevation, exploration of the cosmic ray distribution at extreme altitudes, and studies of the upper atmosphere are some specific problems because of the variable motion introduced by varying the orientation and the consequent irregular drag. The present schedule in establishing the precision camera program has necessitated a leisurely program. This more leisurely program has more than offset this loss, in terms of improved orbital and meteorological information.

The successful photographs of the first two American satellites by several of the newborn stations is a gratifying signal of the routine tracking soon to be effected.

Perforce certain delay physical assistance received through the respective I.G.Y. commitments from governments of Argentina, Australia, India, Iran, Japan, Netherlands Antilles, Peru and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Their synchronization assistance was indispensable, and though the special program has been deferred into the International Geophysical Year, their previously established cooperation must be complimented.

An integral part of the optical tracking program, is the far-flung complement of optical instrumentation. Visual observation, high speed cinematographic study of satellite passage and rapid acquisition, independent determination of position of satellite and triangulation, are combining and shortly before the demise in final stages of the existence of a satellite COCIOYAI/AFR satellite stations during the period of main preparation of the photographic tracking program.

Largley through the use of MOONWATCH observations, the capabilities and operations of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has been able to derive significant data. Even though precise results are treated in Chapter III and include the orbit determination of 1958 a and are the subject of another report, there are a few general aspects related to the perigee distance to be noted. The relative positions as they say of March 1958 have essentially the same expectancy gave that in all probability it must be concluded that in 1958, which probably have a significantly shorter lifetime; but still remains a detail to be. Various computational programs have been devised, and others are in progress, for the utilization of satellite observations for prediction purposes as contrasted to those use recently for geophysical interests. The programs at Pennsylvania State University have been programmed to determine geographical points have been programmed an ambition to determine the precise relation to the program which points out actual Beker-Munn camera settings can be cabled directly to the network installations. Implicit in the prediction program is the objective to disseminate the only specific predictions but general satellite information or an astronomical character to the public through the several mass media. This we have by concine statements to the press and by the preparation of charts illustrating visible passages of satellites over the United States.

2. PHOTOGRAPHIC REDUCTION 
Photographs of American satellites 1958 a and 1958 b1 as obtained during the tracking operations mentioned above have been thoroughly examined and studied for the purpose of photographic tracking stations. Such photographs showing satellites, after immediate field reading, are being reduced for precise data evaluation.  The data display is such that we may be able, with further efforts, to obtain also precise photographic data similar to that provided by the Moonwatch program for the evaluation of detailed position information.  It is expected that a catalogue of position data from these tracking cameras can be issued soon in a nature similar to the catalogues of MOONWATCH data.

3. REDUCTION OF PHOTOTRACK OBSERVATIONS
A considerable number of photographs of the world's satellites have been made by the tracking stations and analytical reduction of these PHOTOTRACK observations is underway in the analytical sections maintained here.  No such photographs have as yet been received here or the U.S. satellite control center.

Moonwatch Observations of Satellites: 1958 Alpha, 1958 Beta One, 1958 Beta Two, and 1958 Gamma
By 
Leon Campbell, Jr.*

Since the launchings of the U.S. artificial earth satellites 1.3, 1958 observations have been participating in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's visual observing program. This program has recorded a total of 59 observation points, these observations being made between March 19 and March 26 of 1958. In addition, the first sighting of 1959y was reported on March 27, 1959.

All observations listed in the following catalogue were listed in the Smithsonian Observatory's computer program for determining satellite points. Some very few other observations are used because the timing of the observations was not to the second or the position of one observing was useful since, having been made during very early twilight or the satellite had just passed almost overhead, certain preliminary orbital elements were useful.

It will be understood that at this time, only days after the 1958 and 1959 launchings, the observations reported of 1958 and 1959 are preliminary values and not yet confirmed by computations and analysis as they may easily develop that some of these sightings must be discarded later.

The observations (by telephone and cable) from MOONWATCH stations in the United States, Australia, Union of South Africa, and Japan. The faintness of the objects and the small inclination of their orbits to the horizon presented conditions that only the most acute observers could recognize and observe. Of the 235 observations associated with this project. 126 of these located in the United States and 104 in other countries.

CHAPTER III
SCIENTIFIC RESULTS

The Orbit and Variable Acceleration of Satellite 1958 Alpha

BY
Charles A. Whitney*

1. The Orbital Parameters
There is no need at present to alter significantly the orbital elements of Satellite 1958 Alpha as published in the Harvard Announcement Card 14&4. It should be noted that the value of Ks is empirical and is derived from it using the theoretical ratio.

2. The Variable Acceleration
During launching, the final stages of 1958 Alpha were given a spin about the body axis. This spin has been expected to stabilize the body axis parallel to the velocity of the rocket at burnout. 

However, such an orientation was soon discovered to be incorrect with consequential data on the variable acceleration. As Lundin of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency informed the writer, the original accelerometer measurements of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, indicate this period is consistent with the suggestion that a slight dissipation of energy and near-conservation of angular momentum very rapidly followed upon the initial buildup. This period is considered to be about the axis of rotation. The rocket now rotates about this axis of greatest moment of inertia, its angular momentum having been essentially unaltered.

The agreement is adequate to confirm the suggested rocket attitude. It is easily shown that the observed accelerations are not compatible with the body axis and the spin axis parallel.

Such a direct scaling of the theoretical accelerations is not precisely determinable from the observations. However, the air-drag term so the comparisons are probably not misleading. Further, it should be noted that the panige drops too fast in the integration, accounting for the increase in the mean of the theoretical acceleration.

dimensionless quantity C.A.p. z/h, where z is the satellite's cross-sectional area, p is the mass, C is the dimensionless aerodynamic drag coefficient, and n is the atmospheric density at sea level.

Now A, the time derivative of a, is clearly C.A/p where P is the orbital period. Moreover, Kepler's second law states that p^2/a^3 = K, therefore C.A/p = (3/2)(a/p).

The only important contributions to the integral in (1) come from portions of the orbit near perigee because of the rapid decrease of density with increasing height. If the density p(r) is approximated, through a region near perigee and above it, by 

p = p_o e^-Kr

where p_o is the density at perigee, z is the altitude above perigee, and K is the logarithmic gradient of density near perigee

K = -2.3026 (4/12) log10 p_o.

then the integral can be shown to be given approximately

Correctly to a few percent when s lies between 0.02 and 0.20 and r exceeds 0.01. Outside these limits, equation (3) is still valid, and may always be used.

If s is as measured in units of 4378 kilometers, there results from (4) the practical formula

G = - 4.826 x 10^-15 p c^1/2  sm/cm^3, (6)

where p is the rate of change of perigee in seconds per day, m is the mass of the satellite in grams, A is the satellite's area in square centimeters projected on a plane normal to the direction of motion, c p is the dimensionless aerodynamic drag coefficient. G is the mean distance expressed in earth radii of 6378 kilometers; g is 1.0367 au [(22).13 in kilometers]; and r(c,e) is given by (5).

An average value of the A of a non-spherical satellite should be used in (3), and for a convex satellite of which all dimensions are roughly equal, the average A is one fourth of its total superficial area. The value of k, sometimes dependent on perigees can be approximated by k = 1.0 which applies for the upper atmosphere like the ARDC altitude range above 700,000 feet, as has been noted in (2) determined by (5) or (3), to two or more satellites with different perigees relating adjustments to until is of consistent with the resulting perigee densities.

I am indebted to Dr. G. P. Schilling for urging me to develop some simple approximate formulas.

Density inferred from 1958 Alpha
Dr. Charles A. Whitney provided orbital data for the American Satellite 1958 Alpha (U.S. Explorer 1). The data, including the mass, the area-to-mass ratio, the mean distance, the mean density, and the perigee and apogee, was used to calculate the density of the satellite. The density was found to be about 1.5 x 10^-14 g/cm^3 at an altitude of 363 kilometers (225 miles), which is about 14 times that predicted by the research model.
The aerodynamic drag coefficient has been taken to be 2.

ARDC model. It falls nearly on the middle curve, No. 2, in a density-altitude region suggested modification of the ARDC atmosphere model to obtain a density of about 1.6 x 10^-8 g/cm3.
The values 4.5 x 10^-13 g/cm3 and 1.5 x 10^-14 g/cm3 depend somewhat upon the gradients of density of the ARDC model employed in the reductions. It seems better to adjust the model to conform to the observed values. This is consistent with the series of densities that result from the 9.5% of the adjusted model as proposed by Harris and Jastrow.
The preferred values at 220 and 368 kilometers can be represented by an additive correction to the common logarithm of the density of the ARDC model, of roughly
0.89 + 0.0015 (z - 220)
where z is the geometric altitude in kilometers above sea-level.

Life Expectancy of Satellite 1958 Alpha
By
Luigi G. Jacchia*

Dr. D. G. King-Hele of the Royal Aircraft Establishments, Farnborough, England, has kindly transmitted to us a useful formula deduced by Dr. D. C. M. Leslie for computing the lifetime of a satellite. At a given time t, the gradual of the satellite is the ratio of time to the period, and the orbital eccentricity. The life expectancy of the satellite as time t can then be expressed as:

T = 3/2 e [1 + 0(a^2)] P/[1 - 0(e)] 

where e = errors of order a^2

This equation gives excellent results when applied to satellites 1957 0, 1957 0 2, and 1957 B.

According to Dr. Charles A. Whitney, on February 1, 1958
we had for satellite 1958 0:
P = 0.079983; P = -4.478 x 10^-6/day; e = 0.139. 

From these data Leslie's formula gives a life expectancy of 1740 days, or 4 years and 9 months; the satellite should then fall toward the end of 1962.

Before the value of P became accurately known from observations, a rough calculation of the drag to be expected on the basis of the physical characteristics of the satellite showed the lifetime should be less than half a year. This prediction was found to be quite erroneous when a life expectancy of several years was deduced.

CHAPTER IV
USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF SATELLITE PREDICTIONS
by
R. M. Adams*

The individual sections of this Chapter discuss in detail the various ephemerides, or computer programs, used by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for the analysis of satellite motions.

The sub-satellite program, developed by Dr. L. G. Jacchia, is a computer program used internally to rapidly analyze incoming observations to define the basic information for the computation of search ephemerides. The program was devised by Dr. Jacchia and originally programmed for the IBM 704 calculator by C. T. Apple.

Ephemeris 5, described by John Gaustad, produces satellite-predicted positions of a nature which are useful for Moonwatch and other observing teams and, in addition, are also of interest to radio and telemetry groups providing tracking data. The operating procedure consists of mailing these predictions to Moonwatch and other groups of interested observers on a regular basis. The predictions are normally accompanied by the critical elements used in making the predictions. These predictions are also distributed by Fairman and Voss.

Ephemeris 4, discussed by Charles Moore and Don Lautman, is designed to produce precise predictions for the twelve major programs established through the world by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. These programs are serviced by telemetry and tracking channels.

Ephemeris 3, discussed by R. Briggs, is designed to produce a sequence of predictions for particular stations in the manner of range, azimuth, altitude, zenith distance for the latitude crossing, and time, altitude, and distance for the meridian crossing. Although it was originally

finally felt that predictions of this nature would be necessary for the individual observing stations. This has not proved to be the case. Due to the comparatively large amount of machine time required for these predictions, and the fact that they will be made only in particular applications when actually required.

The charts of predicted satellite positions, described by Jean B. Fairman and George Yeis, were originally intended for interested news agencies in the form of a daily bulletin. Its use has now been extended to interested observers of the satellite paths, such as the amateur radio operators and broadcast observers over the Civil Air Patrol Communication Network, thus enabling rapid dissemination of predictions. Arrangements have been made whereby observing teams are contacted daily by CAP units stationed at satellite passage points. To a great extent, this arrangement has been occasioned in distributing predictions by mail. This is necessitated in distributing predictions to those instances in which it is impossible to make accurate predictions for more than 3 or 4 days in advance due to fluctuations in the rate of a satellite-life's acceleration.

The text in the document is as follows:

Program for Determination of Geographic Sub-Satellite Points

by 
Luigi G. Jacchia*

The sub-satellite-point routine was devised for the double purpose of rapidly analyzing incoming observations and of obtaining from them the basic results necessary to compute a search ephemeris. Osculating equatorial elements are assumed for a time t0 (either an ascending node or a perigee crossing) and integrated to the time t, the elements for this time t are then corrected for secular perturbations and drag.

The elements are given in the following form:

x^a = x0 + c^a + c^a2 + c^a3
y = a + d^a2 + d^a3
1 = constant
q = constant 

Here t is the time of ascending-node crossings, T
the time of the next ascending-node crossing, the argument of perigee,
i the orbital inclination, q the perigee distance, and
n the number of revolutions elapsed since t0. Ca, c^a, d^a
d^a are constants. The right ascension of
the ascending node, , (or the longitude of the node) since it is required only to know whether
the observation was made on the ascending or the descending
half of the orbit.

Every observation consists of two spherical co-ordinates
(right ascension and declination, or azimuth and altitude)
referred to a time t, and to a set of station co-ordinates,
which are fed into the machine program as input data. First
the machine computes the value of the node or perigee
crossing immediately preceding the observation's time and
from this value, the co-ordinates under which the observations
were made are computed from the formulas given in the
program.

Instantaneous major axis a and the eccentricity e. The height above the sea level at the time of observation is obtained initially by trigonometric process; a first it is compared with data from a nearby telemetry station; using this height, an approximate sub-satellite point is computed; using its latitude; this gives a new approximation to the sub-satellite point, and so on.

Once the sub-satellite point is stabilized, instantaneous orbital elements are computed from this using the orbital elements; residuals are also taken from large-scale diagrams.

The program gives somewhat uncertain results when the observations are made near the optical apex (the point on the celestial sphere toward which the satellite is moving); this is well known from other observations, that from some position the satellite launch or injection may be mistaken for a new satellite. Instead of 2(=z - right ascension of station) r will still be usable, although no independent value of s can thus be obtained.

The document provides a general satellite prediction program and discusses the format and use of the program for various satellites, including Russian satellites from 1957. The document also mentions the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

Predictions for Crossings of Given Latitude Parallels -- AFO Ephemeris 5

by
John Gausdat*

Ephemeris 5 is a general satellite prediction program written for the IBM 704 computer. It is designed to produce a concise summary of predictions in a form suitable for observations and other uses. The program computes and distributes the time of crossings of given latitude and longitude parallels and the height of the satellite above the earth's surface. The program is not intended to have the specific applicability of ephemerides and individual camera tracking stations, but because of its generality it takes very little computation time.

The program produces as its primary output a list of all crossings of a parallel of latitude in a specified period of time. It lists for both the south-north and the north-south crossings: the time of crossing, the longitude, and the height of the satellite above the earth's surface. The axis of the parallel need not lie between the meridian and the grace of the satellite path on the earth's surface.

The program is general enough so that it can be used for any satellite and any parallel of latitude. For the Russian satellites, 1957 Alpha and 1957 Beta, the most useful information was the crossing of the 40 north parallel, this being about the middle of the visible passing of the satellite. The use of this lower inclination, the parallel's motion, and other factors may be generally used. The program can also be used in making predictions for the system of simultaneous observations.

The format of the predictions can be varied by the use of code numbers on the input cards. It can be handled in either Eastern Standard Time (EST) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). The longitudes are all in degrees west of Greenwich, and heights in either miles or kilometers.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document or report from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text contained in the document is as follows:

In addition the results may be rounded to the nearest minute, tenth of a degree, or nearest one hundredth of a mile. Together the quantities include azimuth, elevation, slant range, time, distance, speed, and height, respectively.

The elements necessary as input data for the program are an equalization either for the time of crossing the ascending node or of passage through tangent of a diurnium; a relation of the numbers of the ascending and descending nodes; the limitations of the right ascension of the ascending node; the implications of the passage distance; and the right ascension of the ascending node; the implications distance. The passage distance is assumed to be constant over the range of prediction. From these elements the predictions are made using the standard equations for an elliptic orbit.

Second and the period perturbations causing changes in the argument of perigee and right ascension of the nodes are accounted for. Atmospheric drag is accounted for implicitly in the equations for time of nodal crossing or perigee passage. Short period perturbations are neglected. This leads to some error in the height predictions directly dependent on the form of the time variation, but for the present satellites, this does not exceed one mile.

A secondary part of the program is concerned with producing a "prediction" report which gives the most pertinent facts about a satellite's orbit. Computed over any interval, rate of change of period, latitude of perigees, rate of change of latitude of perigees, height of perigee, height of apogee, and height over any specific parallel or latitude (adjusted for 1957 Alpha and 1958 Gamma) for both the north-south and east-west crossings.

The program is in operating condition and has been used since basically for the past several weeks in making predictions for the U.S. satellites. Changes are contemplated in the future to incorporate more accurate data and to insure that the program works properly for special uses such as inclinations greater than ninety degrees (retrograde satellites).

Predictions for Photographic Satellites Tracking Stations - AFC Ephemeris II
by
Charles H. Moore* and Don A. Lautman**

Ephemeris 4 is the computer program for predicting satellite positions for the Baker-Nunn camera stations. The present formulation utilizes the currently best set of elements available, accounting for the drag by means of atmospheric densities. In the mean motion including only the terms to the first order, the numerical integration which includes the effects of oblateness and eccentricity excitation. In some cases the drag can be neglected, a complete driver-record perturbation theory including periodic perturbations can be used.

The main requirements demanded of predictions intended for camera stations are: (1) predictions must be limited to observable passages and (2) predictions must be made for the point of culmination. The optimum approach would be to integrate the equations of motion for the satellites, obtaining these predictions, as well as other data, direstly.

However, to obtain predictions as soon as possible.

This program for the IBM EDPM 704 employs the orbital elements of the satellites and transforms them by graphical (trigonometric) means into specific predictions. The accuracy of the predictions will well within the accuracy of the observed elements, and is fixed by the refinement to which the time is propagated. This prediction can be gotten without employing more sophisticated methods, and is fitted to the requirements of the Baker-Nunn tracking cameras.

The input to the computer consists basically of the coordinates of the stations (latitude, longitude, and height) and the orbital elements. The computer program guides the time at which the satellite is at the ascending node.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly a Project Blue Book report, that describes a program that computes predictions about the motion and appearance of an unidentified flying object.

The program follows a general outline listed in the text, including:

(1) Reduction of station coordinates to more convenient values.
(2) Updating ephemerides and position computations for the object.
(3) Computation of the point of entry into and exit from the earth's shadow.
(4) Computation of the possible visibility of the object from various stations, and information about this visibility.

The text goes on to describe the three distinct portions of the program's output, including information about the object's motion, its position relative to the earth's shadow, and its visibility from various stations.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page of text from a document, likely related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

The text on the page discusses the approach and passage of an object into or out of the Earth's shadow, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various orbital elements for the observation of such phenomena.

OCR Output:
- Closest approach. 
- Approach at right ascension 102*52 declination -02 48 passage into or out of the earth's shadow.  
- Time of intersection with the earth's shadow.
- Zenith angle of the sun.
The advantages of the program are an expected minimum of computation time, and the elimination of superfluous data. Many non-observable reductions, with such a program, can be omitted. Orbital elements are available. The disadvantage of the program is the independence upon the independently determined or-

Briggs. The text describes a program that computes a sequence of satellite positions and corresponding times for a given observing station. It mentions that the program will see use when the operations of air drag are included under these restrictions, and that Ephemeris 3 has not yet been used for the American satellite program.

Program of Spot Predictions for
Specific Observing Sites -- APO Ephemeris 3
by
R. Briggs*

This program computes for a given observing station a sequence of satellite positions in latitude-azimuth and corresponding times. This sequence comprises all the ob-servable (angular) transits and meridian crossings which will occur within a specified interval of time, and the daily duration of first and last derivatives in the motions of perisee and node, and to the assignments of constant periods and alti-tudes. When the ef-fects of air drag are included under these restrictions, the positions may be in error by at most four degrees and the times in error by a few seconds.

As yet, Ephemeris 3 has not been used for the American satellites. It is planned to make minor revisions in the program so that the anomalistic period of the satellite can be used in place of the nodal period. Further, derivatives are being introduced into the program which will see use when the operational si-tuation warrants the comparatively large amount of machine time required.

Charta of Predicted Satellite Positions
by
Jean B. Fairman* and George Vels**

In an effort to provide more information in forms immediately useful, without considerable computation, for observers in the U.S. and generally understandable to the general public, we have made our prediction data available on a daily basis in maps and schedules, more than on a monthly basis as many magazines and newspapers have done, The primary purpose of this mail is the primary schedules and maps.

1. Visibility Maps

The first of these additional distribution operations was our production for the newspapers, with occasional requests made for the newspaper distribution showing us. The distribution through this additional distribution has been to encourage the publishing of these maps and/or satellite predictions on a daily basis by the papers both for the specific information as our many observers and for general interest of the general readers, as a supplement to the sometimes delayed and inaccurate public announced by the Astronomical data which may have been issued up by the government for distribution.

Although their correspondent reports a general lack of interest among subscribers, a sample of these maps is shown following this section.

These map contains all visible passes of the satellite to a period of a given interval of brilliantÃ©light period of a few days. Past the time, location and direction of the pass relative to the observer, who can locate himself easily on the map. The maps are designed to appear as simple as possible, with straight lines briefly applying the meaning of the outlines (omitted in the samples).

The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book with text discussing the visible portion of a satellite's passage. I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

The visible portion of each passage is shown as a solid line, and its dashed extension represents the non-visible portion of general visibility. Each of the cross bars on the satellite path represent a minimum or a maximum of travel, so that the time of the satellite's passage over any point can be readily determined.
The visible path departs the station at a certain altitude and reappears at the horizon at a lesser altitude. In addition to the twilight boundary, the complete area within which the satellite may be seen, as a function of its height.
In spite of the relative simplicity of the diagram, its constructions incorporates the following factors, which give it a reasonably good degree of accuracy:
(1) Inclination of the orbit.
(2) Period or speed of the satellite - this affects the time markings on the satellite path.
(3) Eccentricity and true anomaly. Corrections for these factors further refine the time intervals.
(4) Height of the satellite. Distances of visibility and location of the earth's shadow depend on this factor.
(5) Rotation of the earth. This affects the long-side or the sub-satellite points.
(6) Regression of the ascending node. This correction further locates the points over which the satellite will pass.
(7) Changes in the coordinates of perigee. Correction for side to the accuracy of the height and period adjustments.
(8) Changes in the declination of the sun. This revision updates the twilight time limits and position of the earth's shadow.

- page 41 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, likely containing text only.

Transcribing the text found in the document:

(2) Changes in the Greenwich Hour Angle of the sun.
This correction refines the time designations around the earth.

The production of these maps was begun for Satellite 1958 Alpha on December 23, 1958 in anticipation of the monitoring of this satellite during the period when it was introduced and its frequency was established, which was early in January 1959. This production continued throughout the period, including a total of 30 daily projections of visible passages of 1958 Alpha.

2. Modified Maps
In a further effort to popularize the regular publishing of satellite data, we have cooperated with various publications in drawing up modified maps.
The most successful venture of this sort to date has been the modified maps carried by the New York Times from the very beginning, showing the visible paths of all the satellites. This map has been diminished from peak, through March 22, when visibility from the U. S. was lost.

These particular modified maps combined in one illustration the visible paths of all the satellites, showing the time intervals of visibility, the ground passages, and monitoring information. The 1958 Alpha is represented by the dashed lines. Those visible passages which terminate in an arrow actually move out of visibility beyond the map included here. For comparison with the first, was sent to the dailies before publication.

We hope to establish this sort of regular publication even more firmly during the next visibility period.

3. Broadcast Releases
Realizing that even if a large percentage of newspaper readers, that some observers would still not be reached, we have arranged through the efforts of the U. S. National Committee for the International Geophysical Year and the cooperation and facilities of the Civil Air Patrol, to set up our predictions to the observing teams and the public through the Civil Air Patrol's scheduled broadcasts. This program operates continually.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document describing project activities related to UFO observations and communications.

hand-in-hand with the "Relative Position Grid" it is felt that this method of "visualization" committee of the I.C.I. to all observing teams, which allows these observers with the indication of our special predictions messages, to produce for themselves "maps" giving the same more information which our regular maps would otherwise supply.

Supplied by the channels of communication by the Civil Air Patrol, we have been aided in getting these predictions communicated to the American Radio Relay League.

When the last visibility period began on February 27, we started sending these predictions to the Civil Air Patrol broadcasting stations, and they in turn are now sending these predictions to the Civil Air Patrol Stations, across the country. These predictions were issued initially for the full visibility period until 18 March 27. During the subsequent period of no visibility, 18 March 27 to 1 April 2,, these predictions necessarily discontinued as they would have no effect.

These three areas of activity, then, are the means by which we have to date attempted to supplement the military's and Air Force's attempts in order to get the needed information to observing teams and the very latest information, on time. We have had an encouraging measure of success in this area, and anticipate further benefits from these efforts.

MEDICINE
Blood and Glass Create Prain-Producing Chemical

A PAIN-PRODUCING substance found in the blood is described in a report in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. This substance appears to be formed by the action of glass on the blood. The substance produces pain when injected into the muscles.

The pain-producing substance appears to be another type of chemical substance in the same general class as histamine, which is known to produce pain. The substance is similar to the factor found in blood producing inflammation. The presence of this substance may account for the pain sometimes experienced by persons who have their blood drawn and is contained in the glass tube.

ANTHROPOLOGY
New Dates Add to Man's Antiquity in America

MAN HAS NOW been shown to have lived in the Americas some 35,000 years ago. This is the oldest date established with certainty.

The date, 35,000 plus or minus 29,000 years, is established in Science, the report of a study of charcoal found in Guanaco Cave, Chile.

The radiocarbon dating method is the tool used in arriving at the age of this charcoal sample. The 35,000-year date greatly extends the antiquity of man in America beyond the previous oldest date of about 14,000 years. This new date shows that man was present in the Americas much earlier than has been believed."

ASTRONOMY

Dog Star Shines in South 

While none of the five planets usually visible to the naked eye can be seen on February evenings, there is a number of first magnitude stars visible. Sirius, the brightest of all, 

By JAMES STOKLEY

* * *

BRIGHTEST STAR of the February evening sky is Sirius, which shines so brightly that it is sometimes called the "Dog Star." This is because of its brightness, which exceeds that of any other star visible to the naked eye, except for the sun.

About that time of year the sun is below the horizon for Sirius, so the star shines in the southern sky all through the evening. This is in contrast with the heat of the sun. For even though the two - Sirius and the sun - are about the same temperature, the sun appears so much larger as to overpower the star's light. 

Sirius is shown on the accompanying map, which gives the appearance of the southern sky at 8 P.M. standard time, at the beginning of February. At that time, the star is just rising above the southern horizon. 

Among the other bright stars are Canopus, Rigel, Betelgeuse, Procyon, Aldebaran and Pollux. These all form conspicuous figures, such as the constellation of Orion, the well-known "Winter Sonthem Cress" and the "Dog Star's Reflection."

Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn are invisible in February. Uranus, which can barely be seen with the naked eye, is very low in the west and setting by that time. so that group is not shown on the map. But it is near Leo, the Lion, and appears nearly as a first magnitude star.

It is generally considered that about a third as many stars are visible at any one time as can be seen with the naked eye under the most favorable conditions. So this section of the southern sky has shown nearly that many stars.

Uranus' Discovery
Uranus was discovered in 1781 by an English amateur astronomer, William Herschel. It was the first planet discovered in modern times, after the ones known since ancient times. It was not until 1846 that the existence of Neptune was proven, also by calculations, and then the planet was observed. With the discovery of Uranus, it was realized that the solar system was more extensive than had previously been thought. And Uranus has proved to be a most interesting world, the first of the larger planets to be discovered.

Uranus turns on its side as it circles the sun, so that its north and south poles alternately point toward the earth. This gives rise to extreme seasonal changes on the planet. At times one entire hemisphere is in daylight, while the other is dark. Then, six months later, the situation is reversed.

At present the northern hemisphere of Uranus is tilted toward the earth, and will remain so for some years to come. During this period, this side of the planet will get increasing amounts of sunlight, and the southern hemisphere will gradually move into darkness.

The discoveries made about Uranus have shown that there are probably additional planets beyond it, and the search for them continues. Clyde Tombaugh discovered the planet Pluto in 1930, after a long search conducted at the Lowell Observatory. But Pluto is a small and very distant world, much less massive than Uranus. So the possibility remains that there are other, more massive planets still to be found in the outer reaches of the solar system.

The Unusual Case of the Knoxville, Tenn.
Lights
Among the many flying discs and saucers reported in recent weeks is a strange case from Knoxville, Tenn., which deserves special consideration. The facts in this case are as follows:
On January 31, 1958, at approximately 8:30 p.m. EST, a young couple, who had been driving along the highway between Knoxville and Powell Station, Tenn., observed a large, glowing, yellow-orange light in the sky to the northwest, at an estimated altitude of about 1,000 feet. The light appeared to be rectangular in shape and was stationary. They watched it for about 20 minutes as it simply hung in the sky, apparently not moving.
After about 20 minutes, the light suddenly shot straight up at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. The observation of this light was reported to the Knoxville Airbase by the witnesses and is being investigated by the Air Force.
While there have been many reports of unusual aerial lights and objects in this area, this particular observation appears to be one of the more significant and puzzling cases reported to date. The Air Force is continuing its investigation and the results will be made public when the investigation is completed.

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

In accordance with your request, I have reviewed the material forwarded and have the following information to report:

On 20 February 1958, a special investigation was conducted at Powell Station, Tennessee, concerning a report of unidentified flying objects sighted in that area on 6 February 1958.  

The investigation was conducted by Captain Lester D. Stevenson, 1st Lt. Walter L. Youngblood, and M/Sgt Arthur J. Bryant, all assigned to the Detachment #4, 1712th Geophysical Squadron, USAF, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

The principal witness, Mr. Joseph Paul Campbell, was interviewed and stated that on 6 February 1958, at approximately 2130 hours, he sighted an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Powell Station, Tennessee. He described the object as being elliptical in shape, extremely bright, and moving at a high rate of speed on a northeasterly heading. Mr. Campbell stated the object was visible for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing from sight.

Mr. Campbell reported the incident to the local civil defense authorities, and it was in turn reported to the Air Force.  The investigation team stated that they were unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the unidentified flying object sighted by Mr. Campbell.  No further details or conclusive findings were provided in the report.

"RYAN SANDERSON SEES GREEN FIREBALL: On the night of Saturday, February 8, the well-known attorney, Robert L. Sanderson, and GET Vice President of the Charlotte, North Carolina, and had just passed the tiny village of Mioco (about 30 miles southeast of Raleigh), when in the back seat, noticing a bright in the northwest luminous object, rising behind the trees in the southwest and catching up with the car. At the time, the trees were silhouetted on a clear sky, and as the object approached it appeared to be in the shape of an elongated oval, emitting a 50 foot or more bright and tapering sharp tail, from which spurted a few orange sparks that looked like short shoots from a rifle. It appeared like a rounded, three-dimensional thing, not a mere glaring light. It passed over, to their left, and within four seconds was lost to view behind the trees. In the northwestly and northernmost maneuvers, the horizontal course of this object seem to put it in the general class of the enigmatic "green fireballs"."

Northern Lights Give
Bright, Colorful Show

Shimmering and fiery curtains of red, green and white blasted across the sky in a dazzling phenomenon known as the northern lights 
or aurora borealis Monday night.

The lights were observed thoroughly and most of the nation observed the phenomenon, which is rather unusual so far south at this latitude.

The lights were observed in points as scattered as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, etc.

No one person living in the Wright View area called the Daily Herald after seeing the red sky to know if fishbites had a big fire.

The unusually intense display had marked effect on radio transmission and later on radio hams in the Minneapoli area reported they were unable to operate 'amateur radio until the display had passed.

REMARKS: Larry - The Air Force has never received a report on this incident. 
About several days ago there was a dispatch or news item on the United Press ticker to the effect that military-type rockets had been sighted over Oates, Ten., and it was concluded that the story caused some excitement to the village military authorities. Apparently this story caused no military action to be taken, nor is it recalled.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

5 March 1958

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 15 February concerning an unidentified flying object in Naples, Italy.

The U.S. Air Force has received no report on this sighting or incident.

The United Press carried a news item on or about 12 February 1958 stating a military type rocket inadvertently placed in an incinerator had caused a mysterious explosion in Naples, and it caused much excitement until military authorities explained the incident.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

POWER STATION - TENN.
LAKE CITY. TENNESSEE

OBJECT OBSERVED:
At approximately 1900 hours on 6 February 1958, a highly luminous egg-shaped object was observed hovering about 200 feet above the ground near a 300 IV. 66.000 volt AC power transmission line about one mile southeast of the TVA Powder River Steam Plant near Lane City. Tennessee.

The object was about 30 feet in diameter and appeared to be illuminated from within. It hovered silently for approximately 5 minutes, then accelerated at terrific speed and disappeared from sight in a northeasterly direction.

Witnesses to the sighting included the shift supervisor at the power plant and three other plant employees. All observers agreed that the object was not an airplane, balloon, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. The local Civil Air Patrol and FAA office were notified of the sighting.

THE SHIFT SUPERVISOR STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO CAUSE INTERMITTENT POWER FLUCTUATIONS ON THE 66,000 VOLT LINE DURING THE PERIOD IT WAS UNDER OBSERVATION.

The image contains a newspaper clipping that describes a report of a "flashing light in sky" that "burns two women". The text of the clipping is as follows:

FLASHING LIGHT IN SKY BURNS TWO WOMEN
TWO New Mexico housewives recently suffered painful burns in a peculiar incident near here when a bright light in the sky struck them as they stood outdoors at night. Their conditions are reported as satisfactory at a local hospital today.
The women, Mrs. Celia Corbin and Mrs. Ella Budd, said the light came from above and struck them on the shoulders, causing immediate pain. They are being treated for second-degree burns on portions of their bodies.
The Civil Aeronautics Authority said it had no report of any object in the air at the time and could not account for the flash of light. Investigators said the women had no knowledge of any nearby experimental aircraft or flares. 
Other aspects of the incident were under study today.

THE TWO VILLAGES. SANTO ANTONIO DE JESUS AND CONCEICAO DA (TNHA. AT ONCE THEY STOPPED THE CAR AND TRIED TO LOCATE THE TROUBLE, BUT TO NO AVAIL. THE NEXT MOMENT THE OBJECT WAS GONE. 
IT WAS THEN THAT THEY SPOTTED A LUMINOUS OBJECT HOVERING OVERHEAD, ACCORDING TO DR. L.J.FONTES, CBPDEC, WHO COMPILED THIS REPORT. IT GLOWED WITH A STRANGE LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE WHOLE OBJECT. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES, AND THEN DISAPPEARED QUITE SUDDENLY, AS IF THE OBJECT DREW ITSELF UP QUICKLY. 
THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE TWO HEMISPHERES ONE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. THERE WAS A SORT OF INTENSE BRILLIANT GLOW SURROUNDING THE WHOLE OBJECT. THE OBJECT CAME INTO VIEW FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED, OBSERVERS AND ABOUT NINETY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THEN IT DESCENDED IN A VERTICAL STRAIGHT LINE UNTIL IT REACHED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT STOPPED AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR SEVERAL SECONDS, THEN IT SHOT UPWARD VERY QUICKLY AND DISAPPEARED, ALL THIS OCCURRING IN A CURTAIN OF LIGHT SUSPENDED BETWEEN THE UFO AND THE GROUND BELOW. 
HOWEVER, DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE AND WALKED TOWARD THE STRANGE OBJECT AS FAR AS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET FROM IT. THE OBJECT SUDDENLY EMITTED A BRILLIANT CLUSTER OF LIGHTS OF MANY COLORS WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE A 'DECORATIVE' EFFECT. THESE LIGHTS STOPPED ABOUT 600 FEET, AND MADE A TIGHT CIRCLE IN THE AIR AND SHOT BACK AGAIN AND TILTED FORTY-FIVE DEGREES IN THIS POSITION THE OBJECT WAS NOTCHED LIKE A COGWHEEL, WHOSE INDENTATIONS APPEARED LIKE A SERIES OF CONCENTRIC LUMINOUS CIRCLES. MINUTES LATER THE OBJECT BEGAN TO MOVE, EXECUTING SOME STRANGE MANEUVERS ACROSS THE SKY, SOMETIMES STATIONARY AND AT OTHER TIMES MOVING IN ANY DIRECTION AT HIGH SPEED, BECOMING AT TIMES A SMALL DOT OF LIGHT ITSELF AND ALMOST DISAPPEARING, THEN REAPPEARING LARGER AND BRIGHTER AGAIN. 
IT WAS GONE. THE TIME WAS 4:55 A.M. ABOUT TWO MONTHS LATER, AT A LOW ALTITUDE, THE SAME OR SIMILAR OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL PERSONS IN THE SAME AREA. AFTER SOME MANEUVERS AND AT TREMENDOUS SPEED AND VANISHED IN A SPLIT SECOND.

TDEIT/MAJ H QUINTANILLA, JR./09/16/66/9/mfb/27 Oct 66
UFO Sighting, 27 February 1958
HQ USAF (SAFOI CC)
Reference the attached letter from 27 February 1958. The following is a suggested reply:
A. Dear Mr. _____,
There have been many accusations made against the Air Force concerning our alleged official stand that "there just ain't no such thing." Our official stand is that there has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that would identify confirmed as unidentified as established as.
If you had reported your observation to the Air Force, our analysts and evaluators would have attempted to determine what you had observed. They would have endeavored to find a logical answer. Then your case would have been categorized as unidentified. The Air Force would not have made your name available to the press without your permission.
It would be extremely difficult at this late date to perform a comprehensive investigation of your observation. It will be filed with our 1957 cases for information purposes; however, it will not be considered a case. There were no UFO reports submitted to the Air Force for 27 February 1958.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with text describing the original intent of the collection of short reports, the current status of the collection, and details about the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory program that launched satellites in 1958.

The text reads as follows:

Preface

The original intent of this collection of short reports was the presentation of preliminary data to the U.S. International Geophysical Year Committee for the Optional Satellite Geophysical Observing Program of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. The first artificial earth satellite launched by the United States on January 31, 1958.

At the present time, however, three more objects have been successfully launched into satellite orbits from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The collection has therefore been expanded to include information and results of data analyzed on these new objects, in addition to the original satellite data, as well as projections of the principal machine computations in use.

Since we are endeavoring to make these satellite data available as rapidly as possible to all interested participants in the International Geophysical Year, we have of necessity included information of an extremely preliminary nature.
