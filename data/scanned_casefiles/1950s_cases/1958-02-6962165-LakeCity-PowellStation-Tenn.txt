CHAPTER I

PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM OPTICAL TRACKING
OF U. S. EARTH SATELLITES

by
J. Allen Hynek* and Fred L. Whipple**

In the satellite program of the International Geophysical Year the complex operations performed by the Optical Satellite Tracking Program of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory are a result of teamwork in the fullest sense of the word. The manifold tasks include the visual acquisition of the artificial earth satellites, the computation of search ephemeredes and predictions, the operation of a world-wide network of precision tracking cameras capable of photographing small objects at distances of hundreds of miles and timing these photographs to better than a thousandth of a second, the scoring, reduction, and analysis of incoming data, and last but not least, the dissemination of the reduced data to the scientific community.

Remembering that since October 4, 1957, there has been a total of eight objects projected into satellite orbits, we hardly need to point out that the efforts expended by thousands of persons, including the volunteer Moonwatch team members, in the Optical Tracking Program alone are outstanding. With great scientific enthusiasm and satisfaction, our staff members have participated in this undertaking, often well beyond the normal call of duty. We have not noted similar dedication save in times of national emergency.

The cooperation of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in furnishing us with critical prediction data for satellites with live radar has been of major importance. Also, the computation of ephemerides and orbital data would have been virtually impossible without the generous cooperation of the International Business Machines Corporation and the Computation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.

The subsequent sections of this collection have been prepared individually by members of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory who are actively working in this particular field and therefore best able to present a factual and informative account of the respective aspects of the program. In this initial chapter, we wish to summarize as well as outline from an overall point of view the orbital data and results which we have been able to obtain with regard to Satellites 1958 Alpha, 1958 Beta One, and 1958 Gamma.

The mainstay of the long-range optical tracking program is the worldwide network of precision photographic stations, employing at each observing station a 3-axis, 20-inch aperture, f/1 camera designed especially for the photographic tracking of artificial earth satellites. The optics for these cameras were designed by Dr. James G. Baker, and constructed by the Perkin-Elmer Corporation. They employ a unique 3-corrector lens system having 4 aspherical surfaces in combination with a 31-inch conventional spherical mirror, providing a useable field of 30°. The motor-driven mechanical drive provides sequential tracking of a satellite and of star background on the same 250 x 55 mm. film frame, in cyclical succession so that many individual photographs can be obtained during a given satellite passage. The unique mechanical system was designed by Mr. Joseph Nunn and fabricated by Boller and Chivens, Inc., all of South Pasadena, California.

The urgency imposed upon the optical tracking program by the launching of the Russian satellites made it desirable to expedite the construction of the stations and to obtain the use of auxiliary cameras to go into operation before the arrival of the Baker-Nunn cameras. Through the excellent cooperation of the Ballistic Research Laboratory we have obtained the use of two S M T (Small Missiles Telecamera) instruments. In addition, several photographic data have been furnished through the courtesy of the U. S. Air Force, thus making possible the completion of tracking network. As discussed by Karl G. Henize in his report, the full complement of Baker-Nunn cameras is expected to be in operation by mid-June.

For an artificial satellite to be tracked most effectively for scientific purposes, the tracking accuracy must be of the order of seconds of arc and of 0.001 seconds of time. A crystal clock of extreme precision has been built by the Ernst Norman Laboratories, Williams Bay, Wisconsin, for each of the twelve observing stations. The time presentation within each camera is photographed on each frame.

It can be stated that the scientific value of a satellite for many geophysical purposes rises greatly with its longevity. Precision observations of near-spherical, close artificial satellites are of little value in solving major geodetic problems because of the variable motion introduced by varying orientation and the consequent irregular drag. Hence the present schedule in establishing the precision camera programs has occasioned little scientific loss. This more leisurely program has more than offset this loss, in terms of improved optical and mechanical performance.

The successful photographs of the first two American satellites by several of the network stations is a gratifying signal of the routine tracking soon to be effected.

The establishment of the photographic network would not have been possible without the cooperation of several foreign governments. Particular note must be taken of the great assistance received through the respective I.G.Y. committees from the governments of Argentina, Australia, India, Iran, Japan, Netherlands Antilles, Peru and the Union of South Africa. Their sympathetic appreciation of the urgency of the total program has been indispensable, and our work in those several countries has been carried out in a thoroughly cooperative manner appropriate to the spirit of the International Geophysical Year.

An integral part of the optical tracking program, complementary to the precision program, is the far-flung visual observing project termed MOONWATCH. Conceived primarily as an acquisition and reconnaissance mission to cover periods immediately after launching and shortly before demise, in final stages of the existence of a satellite, MOONWATCH teams have served continuously as interim tracking stations during the period of final preparation on the photographic tracking stations. The exemplary work of the several thousand persons involved in this program stands out as a significant contribution to the satellite program, and an outstanding example of lay participation in an international scientific venture.

Largely through the use of MOONWATCH observations, the computations and analysis division of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has been able to derive significant, even through preliminary, scientific results. These are treated in Chapter III and include the orbit determination of 1958α and a valuable variable acceleration of this satellite and of its life expectancy.

With respect to 1958β, the perigee distance is so relatively high that little can be said of its 11π expectancy save that in all probability it must be counted in decades. Its rocket carrier, 1958β, will probably have a significantly shorter lifetime, but still perhaps a decade or more.

Various computational programs have been devised, and others are in process, for the utilization of satellite observations for prediction purposes as contrasted to their use for results of geophysical interest. Ephemerides for general use as well as for specific use at given geographical points have been programmed; an example of the latter is the program which prints out actual Baker-Nunn camera settings which can be cabled directly to the network stations.

Implicit in the prediction program is the objective to disseminate not only specific predictions but general satellite information of an astronomical character to the public through the several mass media. This we have recognized and met by concise statements to the press and by the preparation of charts illustrating visible passages of satellites over the United States.

At four of the stations listed above, Super Schmidt meteor cameras or Small Missile Telegrams have been installed on an interim basis. As shown in Table Two, these instruments will eventually be replaced by Baker-Nunn cameras, thus resulting in a world-wide network equipped with identical instruments of superior precision and accuracy.

The dates in Table One are dates of actual accomplishment. The dates listed below in Table Two represent our present schedule for the remaining Baker-Nunn cameras.

2. Photographic Reduction

Photographs of American satellites 1958 α and 1958 B1 were first obtained during the visibility period around March 18, 1958, at our photographic tracking stations. Successful photography continues and the films showing satellites, after immediate field reading, are being reduced for precise data evaluation. The image quality is such that we may be able, with further efforts, to obtain also precise photographs of Satellite 1958 22. This program for precise data reduction at Cambridge is under the supervision of Dr. George Van Biesbroeck, Consultant. Special precision measuring engines for film reading and scan area used, resulting in highly accurate position data from the tracking cameras can be issued soon in a nature similar to the catalogues of MOONWATCH data.

3. Reduction of PHOTOTRACK Observations

A considerable number of photographs of the Soviet satellites have been received from PHOTOTRACK stations and amateur photographers and are being reduced in an analogous manner. No such photographs have as yet been received of the U. S. satellites.

Moonwatch Observations of Satellites 1958 Alpha,
1958 Beta One, 1958 Beta Two, and 1958 Gamma

By
Leon Campbell, Jr.*

Since the launchings of the U.S. artificial earth satellites, 13 MOONWATCH stations participating in the Smithsonian Astronomy Observatory's visual observing program have reported a total of 59 observations. These were made between February 3 and March 24 of 1958b and the first sighting of 1958a was made on March 20, 1958. In addition, the first sighting of 1958y was reported on March 27, 1958.

All observations listed in the following Catalogue were used in the Smithsonian Observatory's computer program for determining subsatellite points. Some very few other observations are not listed here because the timing of the observations was not to the second or the position to one degree of arc. However, these unlisted observations were useful since, having been made during very early orbiting of the satellites, they served as checks on preliminary orbital elements.

It will be understood that at this time, only days after the 1958 and 1958y launchings of satellites, the observations reported of satellites in 1958a and 1958y are preliminary values and not yet confirmed by our Computations and Analysis Section. It may easily develop that some of these sightings must be discarded later.

The cataloged observations were reported (by telephone and cable) from MOONWATCH stations in the United States, Australia, Union of South Africa, and Japan. The faintness of the objects and the small inclination of their orbits to the equator account for the fact that only 13 stations have made observations to date (March 27, 1958). There are, as of March 27, a total of 230 stations associated with the Smithsonian Observatory's MOONWATCH network, with 126 of these located in the United States and its territories, and 104 in other countries. These observations of

the U.S. satellites were made during a period in which many of the 230 stations were engaged in observing 1957β1 as well.

Two MOONWATCH teams reported unique observing experiences. Alamogordo station 102 on March 19 1957β1 1958a and 1958β1; the latter two objects were about 1.3m 30s apart. Albuquerque station 103 on March 20 observed 1958β1 1958β2 and 1958a in that order.

The Catalogue lists the observations by object, and in chronological order. The Key to MOONWATCH Station Code Numbers gives the geographical coordinates of the stations listed in the Catalogue.

It will be noted that the position of the satellites is given either in right ascension and declination or in azimuth and altitude. Azimuth is measured clockwise from north through 360°. The Catalogue and Key to Station Code Numbers follow:

CHAPTER III
SCIENTIFIC RESULTS

The Orbit and Variable Acceleration of
Satellite 1958 Alpha

By
Charles A. Whitney*

1. The Orbital Parameters

There is no need at present to alter significantly the orbital elements of satellite 1958 Alpha as published in the Harvard Announcement Card 1404, reproduced in Chapter V. It should be noted that the value of Alpha is empirical and is derived from it using the theoretical ratio.

2. The Variable Acceleration

During launching, the final stages of 1958 Alpha were given a spin about the body axis. This spin has been expected to stabilize the body axis parallel to the velocity of the rocket at burnout.

However, such an orientation was soon discovered to be inconsistent with Smithsonian data on the variations of acceleration of the rocket. Dr. Charles Lundquist of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency informed the writer that radio-signal strength measurements of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, indicate tumbling with a period of about 7 seconds. This period is consistent with the suggestion that a slight dissipation of energy and near-conservation of angular momentum very rapidly led to a reorientation of the body axis into a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The rocket now rotates about the axis of greatest moment of inertia, its angular momentum having been essentially unaltered.

In an effort to test this suggestion, the period-
changes of 1958 Alpha have been re-examined.

Table I lists normal points for the perigee times as a
function of revolution number, counting from the first
passage of revolution through perigee and computed for the perigee given
on H.A.C. 1404. Times are given in 1958 year days and
decimals taking January 1.0 = 366.0.

TABLE I
Perigee Times of 1958 Alpha
Normal Points

[A table follows with columns N, T, (C-C), and rows with numerical values]

Changes of anomalistic period are derived by double
differentiation of this table. Facilitare the differentiation and to smooth the data, the following representation
of the time of perigee has been derived:

T = 397.16189 + 0.079827051 - 1.91 x 10^-7N^2
+ 0.00037 sin (0.0153N) - 0.000062 sin (0.0112N).


- page 19 -

Here is the text from the document:

- 16 -

This expression replaces that given on H. A. C. 1404. Differences (O-C) between the normal points and this expression are given in Table I, and the fit is within the uncertainties.

The acceleration is then

dP/dN = -3.82 x 10^-7 - 0.87 10^-7 sin (.0153N) + 0.078 10^-7 sin (.0119N)

Table II lists values of this acceleration.

250  -3.25  -3.17   600  -3.7   -3.50
300  -3.0   -3.06

Lundquist has kindly made available a numerical integration of the equations of motion—including initial conditions specified by the writer. A value of acceleration some 5.3 times the observed value was obtained, through choice of parameters. By adjusting the mean value to the observed mean, the column of theoretical accelerations in Table II is obtained.


- page 20 -

- 17 -

The agreement is adequate to confirm the suggested rocket attitude. It is easily shown that the observed accelerations are not compatible with the body axis and the spin axis parallel.

Such a direct scaling of the theoretical accelerations is not strictly legitimate because long-period variations are improperly manipulated. However, these latter appear smaller than the air-drag term so the comparison is probably not misleading. Further, it should be noted that the perigee drops too fast in the integration, accounting for the increase in the mean of the theoretical acceleration.

The Density of the Upper Atmosphere**

By
Theodore E. Sterne**

1. Introduction

I shall present a formula for the inference of air density from the orbital motion and physical characteristics of artificial earth satellites, and then I shall apply it to orbital data, for the American earth satellite 1958 Alpha, kindly provided me by Dr. Charles A. Whitney.

2. A Formula for Inferring Atmospheric Density from the Motion of Artificial Earth Satellites

In a paper in press1 the author has made a basic theoretical study of the effects of air resistance upon the motion of close earth satellites. The first equation of Section 2 of that paper is

[A mathematical equation is displayed, which appears complex and involves multiple variables]

Where a and e are the mean distance of the satellite orbit and its eccentricity, respectively; where Δ is an operator denoting the increase in one revolution of the quantity upon which it operates, where a₀ is the earth's equatorial radius, where P(r) is the atmospheric density at geocentric distance r, and where E is the eccentric anomaly.

The formula and conclusions about atmospheric density, in this article, have been communicated to Science.

dimensionless quantity C₀A₀ a₀/m, where A is the satellite's cross-sectional area, m its mass, C₀ the dimensionless aerodynamic drag coefficient that is believed on theoretical grounds to be approximately 2, and ρ₀ is the atmospheric density at sea level.

Now A, the time derivative of a, is clearly Δa/P where P is the orbital period. Moreover, Kepler's second law states that P varies like a³/². Therefore P/P = (3/2)a/a, and therefore P = 3Δa/2a.

The only important contributions to the integral in (1) come from portions of the orbit near perigee because of the rapid decrease of density with increasing height. If the density ρ(r) is approximated, through a region near perigee and above it, by

ρ = ρ₀ e⁻ᴷᶻ

where ρ₀ is the density at perigee, z is the altitude above perigee, and K is the logarithmic gradient of density near perigee

K = -2.3026 (d/dz) log₁₀ ρ₀                (2)

then the integral can be shown to be given approximately but closely by

[complex mathematical equation]

where c = Kae, and where I₀(c) and I₁(c) are Bessel functions of purely imaginary argument. It follow that

[another mathematical equation]                (3)

with rather high accuracy under all conditions.

The Bessel functions can be expanded asymptotically in descending powers of c, and if this is done equation (3) becomes

Where
r(c,e) = 142e^4 + (3e^2/2) + 1.6e-10.5e^2 + 9+30*85.5e^2 / 128e^2    (5)

correctly to a few percent when e lies between 0.02 and 0.20 and K exceeds 0.01. Outside these limits, equation (3) is still valid, and may always be used.

If a is measured in units of a, 6378 kilometers, there results from (4) the practical formula

r/r = - 4.826 x 10^-15 p (m/A C_D a f(c,e))^(1/2) gm/cm^3,    (6)

where p is the rate of change of period in seconds per day, m is the mass of the satellite in grams, A is the satellite's area in square centimeters projected on a plane normal to the direction of motion, C_D is the dimensionless aerodynamic drag coefficient, believed to be approximately 2; a is the mean distance expressed in earth radii of 6378 kilometers; if z, in (2), is in kilometers; and r(c,e) is given by (5).

An average value of the A of a non-spherical satellite should be used in (2), and for a convex satellite of which all orientations occur with equal frequency the average A is one fourth of its total superficial area. The value of K, somewhat dependent on perigee height, can be approximated by applying equation (1) somewhat above perigee to a model atmosphere like the ARDC. Alternatively, K may be determined without reference to assumed models by applying equation (5), or (3), to two or more satellites with different perigee heights and adjusting it until it is consistent with the resulting perigee densities.

I am indebted to Dr. W. F. Schilling for urging me to develop some simple, approximate, formulas.

3. Density Inferred from 1958 Alpha

Dr. Charles A. Whitney provided orbital data for the American artificial satellite 1958 Alpha, as of February 1, 1958.

The data, 3 which he obtained from an analysis of "Moonwatch" (visual) and "Minitrack" (radio) observations, were: eccentricity 0.139, inclination 33°.2, argument of perigee 120°.0, anomalistic period 6*.0792274, rate of decrease of period 3.9 x 10-7 days per period or about 0.12 per day. From these data I have inferred a mean distance of 1.22757 earth radii, corresponding to a perigee height above the international ellipsoid of 368 kilometers.

The satellite is a cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 80 inches long, with a mass of about 14 kilograms. The area of such an object, relevant to its air resistance, is its area projected on a plane normal to its direction of motion. The average over all possible orientations for random tumbling is 1/4 of the total superficial area, or 2520 cm². The same value is obtained if it is considered that the cylinder spins about a transverse axis, randomly oriented with respect to the orbital plane, and gradual orbital changes influence the orientation of the spin axis near perigee from passage to passage. Averaged over a spin period, over orientations of the spin axis with respect to the orbit plane, and over the motion of perigee the same average value is obtained as for random tumbling, 2520 cm²; this value has been employed as A in equation (6).

The aerodynamic drag coefficient has been taken to be 2.

The density has been inferred by the method described in Section 2 of this article from this value, the mass, the average area, the pecentricity, the mean distance, the rate of decrease of period, and the logarithmic derivative of density near perigee given by the ARDC model atmosphere.

The density thus found, about 1.5 x 10-14 gm/cm³ at a geometric altitude of 368 kilometers (348 geopotential) is about 14 times that predicted at such an altitude by the

ARDC model. It falls nearly on the middle curve, No. 2, in a study that tentatively suggested a modification of the ARDC atmospheric model to satisfy a density of 4.5 x 10-13gm/cm3 at 220 kilometers (213 geopotential) that had been inferred from observations of the USSR satellite 1957 Alpha 2. This value was about 9 times the ARDC density.

The values 4.5 x 10-13 gm/cm3 and 1.5 x 10-14 gm/cm3 depend somewhat, although not strongly, upon the gradients of density of the ARDC model employed in the reductions. It seems better to adjust the model so as to render it consistent with the parsed densities than results from the K's of the adjusted model. A formal least-squares adjustment has not yet seemed warranted but a non-least-squares adjustment, allowing for the effect of the adjustment upon K, has indicated densities of about 4.0 x 10-13 gm/cm3 at 220 kilometers (geometric) and about 1.4 x 10-14 gm/cm3 at 368 kilometers (geometric). These values do not agree well with the densities predicted by Harris and Jastrow as extrapolations from altitudes of about 220 kilometers and below. They appear to be in unexpectedly good agreement with curve No. 2 of reference 5, do not involve any very implausible temperature gradients, and I prefer them.

4. Adjustment of the ARDC Atmosphere

The preferred values at 220 and 368 kilometers can be represented by an additive correction to the common logarithm of the density of the ARDC model, of roughly

0.89 + 0.0015 (z - 220)

where z is the geometric altitude in kilometers above sea-level.

Life Expectancy of Satellite 1958 Alpha

By
Luigi G. Jacchia*

Dr. D. G. King-Hele of the Royal Aircraft Establishments, Farnborough, England, has kindly transmitted to us a useful formula developed by Dr. D. G. M. Leslie for computing the lifetime of a satellite. At a given time t let P be the period of the satellite, Ṗ the rate of change of the period, and e the orbital eccentricity. The life expectancy of the satellite at time t can then be expressed as

T = 3/e [1 + O(e)] P/Ṗ   [O(e) = errors of order e]

This equation gives excellent results when applied to satellites 1957 α1, 1957 α2 and 1957 β.

According to Dr. Charles A. Whitney,¹ on February 1, 1958 we had for satellite 1958 α:

P = 0.07983; Ṗ = -4.978 x 10⁻⁶/day; e = 0.139.

From these data Leslie's formula yields a life expectancy of 1740 days, or 4 years and 9 months; the satellite should then fall toward the end of 1962.

Before the value of Ṗ became accurately known from observations, a rough calculation of the drag to be expected on the basis of the physical characteristics of the rocket satellite and of the Smithsonian Interim Atmospheric Densities had given a predicted value of -5d7 x 10⁻⁶/day for Ṗ, from which a life expectancy of 3 to 5 years was deduced.

CHAPTER IV

USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF SATELLITE PREDICTIONS
by
R. M. Adams*

The individual sections of this Chapter discuss in detail the various ephemerides, or computer programs, used by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for the analysis of incoming observational data.

The sub-satellite program, developed by Dr. L. G. Jacchia, is a computer program used internally to rapidly analyze incoming observations and to derive the basic information for the computation search ephemerides. The program was devised by Dr. Jacchia and originally programmed for the IBM type 650 computer by R. E. Briggs. It was later translated for use with an IBM type 704 Calculator by C. T. Apple.

Ephemeris 5, described by John Gaustad, produces satellite predictions of a nature which are useful for Moonwatch and other observing teams and, in addition, are also of interest to the general public. These predictions are easily obtained and can be distributed readily. Normal operating procedure consists of mailing these predictions to Moonwatch teams, astronomical observatories, and other groups of interested observers on a regular basis. The predictions are normally accompanied by the orbital elements used in making the predictions. These predictions are also used for constructing the charts described by Fairman and Vais.

Ephemeris 4, discussed by Charles Moore and Don Lautman, is designed to produce precise predictions for the twelve photographic tracking stations throughout the world by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. These predictions are sent in coded form by telecommunication channels on a day by day basis.

Ephemeris 3, discussed by R. Briggs, is designed to produce a sequence of predictions for particular stations in the nature of time, azimuth, altitude, height, and distance for the latitude crossing, and time, altitude, and distance for the meridian crossing. Although it was ori-

ginally felt that predictions of this nature would be neces-
sary for the individual observing stations, this has not
proved to be the case. Due to the comparatively large amount
of machine time required for these predictions, it is now
felt that they will be made only in particular applications
when the situation warrants.

The charts of predicted satellite positions, described
by Jean B. Fairman and George Veis, were originally intended
for internal use and, incidentally, for presenting predictions
to increased news agencies in a form convenient for public
use. However, the use of these charts has been extended.
They now provide information which is broadcast over the
Civil Air Patrol Communications Network, thus enabling rapid
dissemination of predictions. Arrangements have been made
whereby observing teams are contacted daily by CAP units
providing the most recent predictions of satellite passages.
To a great extent, this arrangement alleviates the problem
encountered in distributing predictions by mail. This is
particularly true, of course, in those instances in which it
is impossible to make accurate predictions for more than 3 or
4 days in advance due to fluctuations in the rate of a satel-
lite's acceleration.

Program for Determination of Geographic
Sub-Satellite Points

by
Luigi G. Jacchia*

The sub-satellite-point routine was devised for the double purpose of rapidly analyzing incoming observations and of obtaining from them the basic results necessary to compute a search ephemeris. Oscillating zequatorial elements are assumed for a time t₀ (either an ascending node or a perigee crossing) and instantaneous elements are derived from then for any time t, using empirical equations to account for secular perturbations and drag.

The elements are given in the following form:

t₀ (or t₇) = t₀ + c₁n + c₂n² + c₃n³
ω = d₀ + d₁t + d₂t² + d₃t³
i = constant
q = constant

Here t₀ is the time of ascending-node crossings, t₇ the time of perigee crossings, ω the argument of perigee, i the orbital inclination, q the perigee distance, and n the number of revolutions elapsed since t₀; c₁, c₂, c₃, d₀, d₁, d₂, d₃ are constants. The right ascension of the ascending node, α₀, is given only in crude form (i.e., α₀ + α₁t), since it is required only to know whether the observation was made on the ascending or the descending half of the orbit.

Every observation consist of two spherical co-ordinates (right ascension and declination, or azimuth and altitude), referred to a time t and to a set of station co-ordinates, which are fed into the machine program as input data. First the machine computes the value of n at the node or perigee crossing immediately preceding t, then computes the nodal or anomalistic period for t by differentiation of n, and proceeds to compute from it the

- 27 -

instantaneous major axis a and the eccentricity e. The height above the sea level at the time of observation is obtained by an iterative process - first it is computed for an orbital point at the latitude of the observing station; using this height, an approximate sub-satellite point is computed, for which in turn a new height is obtained using its latitude; this gives a new approximation to the sub-satellite point, and so on.

Once the sub-satellite point is stabilized, instantaneous values of a, a0, are computed from the orbital elements; residuals are taken for both quantities from empirical equations to facilitate the task of plotting their values on large-scale diagrams.

The program gives somewhat uncertain results when the observations are made near the orbital apex (the highest or lowest latitude) of the point. In those cases, if a0 is well known from other observations, the iteration for the sub-satellite point can be made to start from a0 - a0h (instead of a0 - a0h, a slight association of station). The times t0 and tw will still be useable, although no independent value of a0 can thus be obtained.

Predictions for Crossings of Given Latitude
Parallels -- APO Ephemeris 5

by
John Gaustad*

Ephemeris 5 is a general satellite prediction program written for the IBM 704 computer. It is designed to prepare a concise summary of predictions in a form easily usable by observing teams and other interested parties and yet general enough for quick production and distribution. It is not intended to have the specific applicability of Ephemeris 3 and 4 to individual MOONWATCH or camera tracking stations, but because of its generality it takes relatively little computer time.

The program produces as its primary output a list of all crossings of a parallel of latitude in a specified period of time. It lists for both the south-north and the north-south crossings the time of crossing, the longitude, and the height of the satellite above the earth's surface. The angle at the point of crossing between the meridian and the trace of the satellite path on the earth's surface is also computed.

The program is general enough so that it can be used for any satellite and any parallel of latitude. For the Russian satellites, 1957 Alpha and 1957 Beta, the most useful information was the crossings of the 40th parallel, this being about the middle of the United States. For the American satellites, because of their lower inclination, 30th parallel crossings are the most generally used. The program can also be used in making predictions for the Southern hemisphere.

The format of the predictions can be varied by the use of code numbers on the input cards. Times may be computed and printed in either Universal Time (UT) or Eastern Standard Time (EST), longitudes in degrees west or east of Greenwich, and heights in either miles or kilometers.

In addition the results may be rounded to the nearest minute, tenth of a degree, and mile, or one hundredth of a minute, one thousandth of a degree, and one hundredth of a mile. For time, longitude, and height, respectively.

The elements necessary as input data for the program are as follows: an equation either for the time of crossing the ascending node or of passage through perigee as a function of the number of revolutions, quadratic equations in time for the argument of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node; the inclination; and the perigee distance. The perigee distance is assumed to be constant over the range of prediction. From these elements the predictions are made using the standard equations for an elliptic orbit.

Secular and long period perturbations causing changes in the argument of perigee and right ascension of the mode are accounted for in the quadratic equations for these elements. Atmospheric drag is accounted for empirically in the equation for time of nodal crossing or perigee passage. Short period perturbations are not included. The semi-major axis is computed directly from Kepler's Third Law, using either the nodal or anomalistic period, depending on the form of the time equation. This leads to some error in the heights, but for the present satellites, this does not exceed one mile.

A secondary part of the program is concerned with producing a 'situation' report which gives the most pertinent facts about a satellite's orbit. Computed for any day are the period, rate of change of period, latitude of perigee, rate of change of latitude of perigee, height of apogee, rate of change of height of apogee, and height over a specific parallel of latitude (40th for 1957 Alpha and 1957 Beta, 30th for 1958 Alpha and 1958 Beta) for both the south-north and north-south crossings.

The program is in operating condition and has been used successfully for the past several weeks in making predictions for the U. S. satellites. Changes are contemplated in the future to incorporate a more accurate method of determining the heights. Tests will be made to insure that the program works properly for special cases such as inclinations greater than ninety degrees (retrograde satellites).

Predictions for Photographic Satellite
Tracking Stations -- AFO Ephemeris 4

by

Charles H. Moore* and Don A. Lautman**

Ephemeris 4 is the computer program for predicting
satellite positions for the Baker-Nunn camera stations.
The present formulation utilizes the currently best set
of almanac available, accounting for the drag by means
of a polynomial in the mean motion, and including only
secular perturbations. The prediction subroutine is a
numerical integration which includes the effects of oblateness and drag exactly. In the case of satellites which
are high enough so that drag can be neglected, a complete
first-order perturbation theory including periodic perturbations can be used.

The basic requirements demanded of predictions intended for camera stations are: (1) predictions must be
limited to observable passes and (2) predictions must be
made for the point of culmination. The optimum approach
would be to integrate the equation of motion for the satellite, obtaining these predictions, as well as other data,
directly. However, a quicker, though less accurate, method
is discussed here, which has been developed in an attempt
to obtain predictions as soon as possible.

This program for the IBM EDPM 704 employs the orbital
elements of the satellite and transforms them by graphical
(trigonometric) means into specific predictions. The accuracy of the predictions is well within the accuracy of
the orbital elements employed, and is probably the best that
can be gotten without employing more sophisticated methods,
and is fitted to the requirements of the Baker-Nunn tracking
cameras.

The input to the computer consists basically of the
coordinates of the stations (latitude, longitude and height
above sea level) and the orbital elements. The latter include the time at which the satellite is at the ascending

node (or at perigee), the right ascension of the ascending node, the argument of perigee, the inclination of the orbit to the equatorial plane, the value of perigee, and the eccentricity of the orbit. Time is given as a polynomial in the number of revolutions, from which the period can be determined; position of the ascending node and perigee are polynomials in time; the other elements are instantaneous values at an arbitrary, specified time. Additional input data includes position of the vernal equinox and the sum for January 0 of the current year, and the dates for which predictions are desired.

The program follows the general outline listed below:

(1) Reduces the station coordinates to more convenient form.
(2) Updates the instantaneous values of the orbital elements. This is done each revolution.
(3) Computes the point of entry into and exit from the earth's shadow. This data may be printed out if desired. It is useful for general predictions where great accuracy is not expected.
(4) Computes the position of culmination for each station, determines whether the conditions for visibility from the stations are fulfilled, and if so prints that information.

There are three distinct portions of the output. First, the latitude, longitude and time of entry into or exit from the earth's shadow. Second, the altitude, azimuth, range, angular velocity, and time of culmination of visible passes for each station. The conditions for visibility employed require that the satellite be visible at least 15° above the horizon and be illuminated by the sun, while the station is inside the earth's shadow. No restriction is placed upon the photographic magnitude of the satellite. Hence, the range is printed to be taken into consideration when using the predictions. Angular velocity is useful for tracking purposes.

The third portion of the output, however, is essentially the station prediction described above, but is put into a code suitable for teletype transmission, which may be sent directly without further reworking.

Thus, the program computes predictions over a specified interval of time and supplies the following information at each visible passage of a station:

(1) Altitude and azimuth of the point of closest approach.


- page 37 -

- 32 -

(2) Time of closest approach.
(3) Apparent angular velocity.
(4) Angle between point of closest approach and passage into or out of the earth's shadow.
(5) Time of intersection with the earth's shadow.
(6) Distance of the satellite.
(7) Zenith angle of the sun.

The advantages of the program are an expected minimum of computation time, and the elimination of superfluous data, namely non-observable predictions. With such a program, predictions can be made to the necessary accuracy as soon as orbital elements are available. The disadvantage of the program is its dependence upon the independently determined orbital elements.

Program of Spot Predictions for
Specific Observing Sites -- APO Ephemeris 3

by
R. Briggs*

This program computes for a given observing station a sequence of satellite positions in altitude-azimuth and corresponding times. This sequence comprises all the observable (visual or otherwise) latitude and meridian crossings which will occur within a specified interval of time. Accuracy is limited at the present to the use of first and second derivatives of the nodal period, to the use of first derivatives in the motions of perigee and the node, and to the assumption of constant perigee distance. When the effects of air drag are included under these restrictions, experience has shown that over two weeks the positions may be in error by at most four degrees and the times in error by a few seconds.

As yet, Ephemeris 3 has not been used for the American satellites. It is planned to make minor revisions in the program so that the anomalistic period of the satellite can be used in place of the nodal period. Further, derivatives of the anomalistic period will include trigonometric and/or exponential terms. These changes are presently being developed and the program will see use when the operational situation warrants the comparatively large amount of machine time required.

Charts of Predicted Satellite Positions

by

Jean B. Fairman* and George Vels**

In an effort to provide more information in forms immediately useful, without considerable computation, for observers in the U.S. and readily understandable to the general public, we have made our prediction data available in several forms other than the formal Ephemerides, the primary prediction material sent by mail.

1. Visibility Maps

The first of these additional distribution operations was our production for the newspapers, wire services, and networks of daily maps of the northern hemisphere showing the visible passes of the satellite. The aim of this distribution has been to encourage the publishing of these maps and/or satellite predictions on a daily basis by the papers and for the specific information of our many observers and for the interest of the general reader, as a supplement to the sometimes delayed mail delivery. To date, they have been regularly picked up by the Associated Press and sent to New York for distribution, although their correspondent reports a general lack of interest among subscribing papers. A sample of these maps is shown following this section.

Each map contains all visible passes of the satellite for morning or evening twilight period of a given day, and shows in an easy to grasp fashion the time, location and direction of the pass relative to the observer, who can locate himself easily on the map. The maps are designed to appear as simple as possible, with a legend briefly explaining the meaning of the outlines (omitted in the samples).

The visible portion of each passage is shown as a solid line, and its dashed extension represents the non-visible interval of the orbit which lies within the area of general visibility. Each of the cross bars on the satellite path represents a minute of travel, so that the time of the satellite's passage over any point can easily be determined. The dot separating the solid and dashed orbit locates the point at which the satellite enters or leaves the earth's shadow, and the line which interrupts the opposite end of the visible orbit represents the 6° twilight (Civil Twilight) boundary. The closed dotted or dashed form encloses the complete area within which the satellite may be seen above 15° altitude. In addition to the twilight boundary, the other sides of the area show the distance from which the satellite may be seen, as a function of its height.

In spite of the relative simplicity of the diagram, its construction incorporates corrections for the following factors, which give it a reasonably good degree of accuracy:

(1) Inclination of the orbit.

(2) Period or speed of the satellite--this affects the time markings on the satellite path.

(3) Eccentricity and true anomaly. Corrections for these factors further refine the time intervals.

(4) Height of the satellite. Distances of visibility and location of the earth's shadow depend on this factor.

(5) Rotation of the earth. This affects the longitude of the sub-satellite points.

(6) Regression of the ascending node. This correction further locates the points over which the satellite will pass.

(7) Changes in the coordinates of perigee. Correction for this adds to the accuracy of the height and period adjustments.

(8) Changes in the declination of the sun. This revision updates the twilight time limits and position of the earth's shadow.

(9) Changes in the Greenwich Hour Angle of the sun.
This correction retains the time designations around
the earth.

The production of these maps was begun for Satellite
1958 Alpha on February 26, in anticipation of the visibility
period which lasted from about February 27 to March 27. The
maps have been produced and distributed regularly throughout
the period, including a total of 30 daily projections of
visible passages of 1958 Alpha.

2. Modified Maps

In a further effort to encourage the regular publishing
of satellite data, we have cooperated with various publications in drawing up modifications of the standard, individual
maps. The most successful venture of this sort to date has
been the modified maps carried by the New York Times from
March 19, through March 22, when visibility from the U. S. was
peak, through March 22, when visibility from the U. S. was
diminishing.

These particular modified maps combined in one
illustration the visible paths of all the satellites, showing
the time intervals of visibility for each passage, but omitting
for simplicity the areas of visibility. In this map, Satellite
1958 Alpha is represented by the heavier orbital paths, the
lighter paths describing Satellite 1957 Beta one. Those visible
passages which terminate in an arrow actually move out of
visibility beyond the margins of the page. The particular
map included here, for comparison with the first, was sent
to the Times before Satellite 1958 Beta was launched and so
does not include it, although it was added by the paper before
publication.

We hope to establish this sort of regular publication even
more firmly during the next visibility period.

3. Broadcast Releases

Realizing that even if a large percentage of newspapers published the maps, that some observers would still
not be reached, we have arranged through the efforts of
the U. S. National Committee for the International Geophysical Year and the cooperation and facilities of the
Civil Air Patrol, to get our predictions to the observing
teams and the public through the Civil Air Patrol's
scheduled shortwave broadcasts. This program operates

- 37 -

hand-in-hand with the "Relative Position Grid" kit issued by the U.S.National Committee of the I.G.Y. to all observing teams, which allows these observers with the addition of our specially tailored prediction messages, to produce for themselves "maps" giving the same sort of information which our regular maps would otherwise supply.

In addition to the channels of communication supplied by the Civil Air Patrol, we have been aided in getting these predictions onto the air by the American Radio Relay League.

When the last visibility period began on February 27, we started sending these special predictions to the National Academy of Sciences for relay to the Civil Air Patrol broadcast stations, and are now sending the predictions directly to four Civil Air Patrol Stations, across the country. These predictions were issued regularly for Satellite 1958 Alpha throughout the last visibility period until March 27. During the subsequent period of visibility, a statement is substituted for the regular messages to that effect.

These three areas of activity, then, are the means by which we have to date attempted to supplement the mailings of standard 30th Parallel Crossings in order to get the needed information to observing teams in this country. In an easy to use form, which can readily be revised and corrected without time lapse to provide the very latest information, on time. We have had an encouraging measure of success in this area, and anticipate further benefits from these efforts.

BACTERIOLOGY

Unique Bird Digests Wax
With Help of Bacterium

> PART OF the honey-guides' secret is
out. Studies of this unusual family of
African birds show that they digest bees'
wax with the help of a bacterium found
in their intestinal tract.

Scientists may hope this discovery may
offer a clue to a new attack against tuberculosis.

The new bacterium was discovered by
Drs. Herbert Friedmann, curator of birds
at the Smithsonian Institution, and Jerome
Korn, formerly of the department of bacteriology at the Walter Reed Medical Center. Army Medical Services Graduate
School. It has been found to have some
"large interfering" with the tuberculosis-causing bacterium.

For years, scientists have been searching
for ways to destroy the lipoidial or waxy
content of the disease organism. It is this
waxy content that very likely protects the
organism against therapeutic attack. Further studies are planned to see how the
waxy content is affected by the new bacterium.

Micrococcus cerolyticuss, as the "waxdigesting" bacterium is called, was described
to the Johns Hopkins University's Society
of Hygiene meeting in Baltimore, Md.
Identification of the bacterium is the result
of more than three years' study of the
honey-guides and their behavior and
biology, Dr. Samuel J. Ail, Walter Reed
Medical Center, has assisted in the research.

MEDICINE

Allergies May Be Factor
In Childhood Leukemia

> ALLERGIES in mothers and children
may be an important factor in the development of childhood leukemia.

This has been indicated by an epidemiological study of the cancerous blood disease
by Dr. Miriam D. Maning, and Benjamin
F. Carroll, Children's Cancer Research
Foundation, Boston, Mass., and the National Cancer Institute, reported in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute
(Dec. 1957).

The scientists found a significantly larger
number of mothers of children with both
leukemia and lymphatic cancer had a history of hay fever, asthma or hives, compared with control groups or with those
having other types of cancer. Their children
also had a higher incidence of allergy, often
appearing as eczema.

Another significant finding was that allergic twice as many mothers of leukemic
children had been exposed to X-rays before
the birth of their child compared with
other groups. The X-ray exposure included

any and all "therapeutic irradiation" both
before or during pregnancy, without relation to the site or dosage of exposure.

The mothers and children did not as a
rule have the same allergy. This might
indicate that the child of an allergic mother
starts life with a greater susceptibility,
though not necessarily the same form of
allergy, to sensitizing agents that may later
damage the blood-forming ability of bone
marrow.

Other researchers have already shown
that hypersensitivity can be transmitted between mother and unborn child.

It may be that the child receives a hypersensitive state from the mother which turns
into leukemia only upon later exposure to
bone-marrow depressing agents.

"We believe that the data presented
justify and should stimulate further investigation along this line of approach to
the problem of acute leukemia in children,"
they conclude.

Big Chest, More Blood
Help Indian on Andes

> ADAPTATION through heredity and
further adaptation during the individual's
lifetime work together to make the big-chested, stocky little Andean Indians able
to live and work hard two miles or more
above the level of the sea.

The changes that these two forces of
adaptation have made in the Indian's body
were studied at Hacienda Vicos, high in the
Peruvian Andes, by Dr. Marshall T. Newman, physical anthropologist of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington.

Most striking is the enormous size of
the Vicos Indian's chest and the lungs inside
it. There is a decided enlargement of the
lower part of the rib cage so that the
Indian can breathe deep and the diaphragm
is also set low. An expanded inner lining
of the lungs makes it possible to pick up
the maximum of oxygen from the thin
mountain air.

The Andean Indian also has more blood
than the man at sea level—on the average
two extra quarts. The red cells in his blood
are larger, providing more surface for taking up oxygen, Dr. Newman reports in
Natural History (Jan.).

With this larger quantity of thicker
blood, the Indians also have a larger, more
powerful heart to pump it. They seem to
have a better blood supply in their extremely, because even in the intense cold of the
mountain top before sunrise, their bare feet
and hands are warm.

Another adaptation that protects them
with from the strain of altitude and the
intense cold is their stocky build. This
reduces the distance that blood must circulate to the extremities and also reduces
the surface area of the body which can
cause loss of body heat by radiation.

Dr. Newman learned the effects of high
altitude during a study of the Vicos Indians' blood pressure. Much of the data
presented in his report is in the work of the
Institute of Andean Biology, Lima, Peru.

MEDICINE

Blood and Glass Create
Pain-Producing Chemical

> A PAIN-PRODUCING substance formed
when blood plasma is brought into contact
with glass is described by Dr. L Margolis,
Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London, England, in Nature (Dec. 28, 1957).

The pain-producing substance appears to
be formed by the action of an enzyme in
the plasma, but it is rapidly destroyed by
another type of chemical substance in the
plasma, called a peptidase.

The formation of the pain-producing substance is similar to the initiation of blood
clotting by glass.

Chemical analysis showed that the pain-producing substance is formed in several
steps. When the plasma is exposed to glass,
a substance that has been called "contact
factor" is first formed. This "contact factor"
then starts further reactions which lead to
formation of the pain-producing substance.
The "contact factor" is most active after
two minutes, but within 20 to 30 minutes
its activity has decreased to negligible values.

Dr. Margolis reports.

The "contact factor" develops normally
in the plasma of persons with certain blood
disorders, such as hemophilia and Christmas
disease, in which the blood has lost much
of its ability to clot.

Apart from glass, certain other surfaces
are capable of activating both pain-producing substance and blood clotting. The exact
surface conditions that are involved are still
being studied, but a clue to the mechanism
may lie in the behavior of dried silica gel
and alumina.

These are both inactive to begin with,
but become quite active after being heated
to above 1,000 degrees centigrade.

New Dates Add to Man's
Antiquity in America

> MAN IS now known to have lived in
what is now Alabama close to 9,000 years
ago. This is the oldest radiocarbon date
for material associated with man's tools
in the eastern United States.

The date, 7,981 plus or minus 200 years
ago, is published in Science (Dec. 27, 1957)
by Drs. W. S. Broecker and J. L. Kulp of
the Lamont Geological Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, N. Y.

The date was obtained from charcoal
found 13 feet below ground in La Kash
Cave, Jackson County.

The radiocarbon dates suggest that man
most likely occupied the west coast of North
America much longer ago than the dates
much longer ago. Charred dwarf bones
were found 30 feet below the top of the
ago plus or minus 1,500.

"This suggests," the scientists say, "that
man occupied the west coast of North America before the major ice advance of the
later part of the Wisconsin glacial period."

ASTRONOMY

Dog Star Shines in South

While none of the five planets usually visible to the naked eye can be seen on February evenings, there are a number of first magnitude stars visible, Sirius the brightest of all.

By JAMES STOKLEY

BRIGHTEST STAR of the February evening sky is Sirius, which shines in the south in the constellation of Canis Major, the great dog. Because of this, Sirius is often called the dog star. Also, it is associated with the so-called "dog days" of midsummer. About that time of year the sun passes rather close to Sirius. Ancient peoples thought, mistakenly, that the rays of this star combined with the heat of the sun to produce the sultry weather which, they supposed, caused dogs to go mad.

Sirius as shown on the accompanying map, which gives the appearance of the sky at about 10:30 p.m., your own kind of standard time, at the beginning of February, an hour earlier at the middle of the evening and about 8:00 p.m. as it covers to an end.

Around Sirius are the other bright stars of the winter evening. Above and right you can see three first magnitude stars: Betelgeuse, a red warrior, with two first magnitude stars: Aldebaran and Rigel. Between these are three stars named Alnilam, Alnitak and Mintaka, that form the warrior's belt. A little higher is Belatrix in his shoulder.

Still higher and farther right we come to Capella, the bull; in this group stands red Aldebaran, another star of the first magnitude.

Auriga, the charioteer, is directly overhead, with brilliant Capella. Below this group, toward the southeast, you come to Gemini, the twins. In it are two prominent stars, Castor and Pollux, which were the names of the twins, famous in ancient Roman mythology. However, only Pollux is of the first magnitude; Castor, a little fainter, is of the second.

And below the twins, in the direction of the big dog, we come to Canis Minor, the lesser dog, in which Procyon stands.

Planets Invisible in February

No planets are visible to the naked eye in February evening sky. Mercury is nearly in line with the sun and cannot be seen at all in February. Venus, which was so bright in the evening sky until recently, is now passing too near the sun and is similarly invisible. By middle of February, however, it will appear in the southeast that before sunrise. In nighttime, it will be of first magnitude.

Saturn also rises in the early morning hours, even ahead of Mars, and is in Ophiuchus, just east of red Antares, which is in Scorpius, the scorpion. In brightness Saturn is about equal to a typical first magnitude star.

Although none of the five planets that are visible to the naked eye—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn—are now in the evening sky, two of the other three are there, and may be seen with a telescope.

Uranus' Discovery

Uranus was discovered in 1781 by an English amateur astronomer, William Herschel. When he first saw it, with a telescope that he had made himself, equipped with a concave mirror 6.5 inches in diameter, he realized that it did not look like a star. A few days later, when he saw it again, Uranus had moved a little, so he concluded that he had found a new comet—and so announced it. Computations showed it to be another planet, more than 1900(1900) miles from the sun, about twice as far as Saturn. It revolves around the sun in 84 years and turns on its axis in 11 hours.

The text on this page appears to be a newspaper or magazine section titled "The Week". However, due to the poor image quality and scanning resolution, much of the text is blurry and difficult to read completely. I can make out some fragments and partial lines, but cannot confidently reproduce the full text without risking inaccuracy. The document appears to be a page from a publication with multiple short news or informational items, but the details are not clearly legible.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Uranus has five visible only through large telescopes. Herschel himself discovered Uranus in 1781, and Urania and Oberon, its two moons, were found in 1787. Another large satellite, Titania, was detected by Lassell in 1847.

During the early 19th century astronomers found Uranus was not decided there must be another planet still further out. Calculations by Le Verrier was responsible in 1846. Close to this place Neptune was observed to be.

At present Neptune is in the constellation of Virgo, not far from Jupiter, and is about 2,791,000,000 miles from the sun, which it crosses about in 165 years, and has satellites: Triton, discovered in 1846, and Nereid. The Triton was also discovered by Dr. Kuiper in 1949.

The most distant known planet is Pluto, discovered by C. W. Tombaugh, at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1930. Its average distance from the sun is 3,671,000,000 miles, or about 39.5 years. Probably it is no larger than the earth, and possibly even smaller. At present it is in the evening sky. In Leo, its longitude is about 15 degrees. It is also shown by a small x on our map. However, only a very large telescope will reveal this planet, which is about the 15th magnitude.

On Pluto, then, the orbit of Pluto and the earth will be lined up in the same direction from the sun with the axis, i.e. Pluto and the sun are in opposition. At such a time Pluto will then be 3,905,000,000 miles closer to the earth.

This image appears to be a map or chart with latitude and longitude lines. Some legible place names include:

- Harbin
- Vladivostok
- Mukden
- Nanking
- Shanghai
- Hong Kong

The map covers an area of East Asia, with numerous numerical coordinates and grid lines. The map is in black and white and appears to be a technical or navigational chart.


- page 57 -

The image appears to be a navigational or astronomical chart with grid lines and various numerical annotations. The text is mostly numerical coordinates and grid references. On the right side of the image, there is a partially visible text that says "GEOSYNTHETIC WHO SCALE" but the rest is cut off or illegible. The chart contains numerous plotted points, lines, and markings across its surface, with numbers ranging from 40 to 100 in various locations.


- page 58 -

This image appears to be a detailed map or chart with numerous grid lines, latitude and longitude markings, and various numerical annotations. The map is predominantly white and black, with a complex network of lines and numbers covering the entire surface. The numbers range from small values like 0.10 to larger values around 100, and are distributed across different sections of the grid. The map seems to be focused on a specific geographical area, with lines converging and diverging at various angles. However, due to the complexity and density of the information, it would be difficult to discern the exact location or purpose of this map without additional context.


- page 59 -

This image appears to be a map or chart with latitude and longitude lines. The document contains numerous numerical annotations scattered across the grid, ranging from 0 to 90 degrees. The map seems to be focused on a polar or near-polar region, with most of the detailed markings concentrated in the central and lower portions of the image. The left side of the document has a dark shadow or edge effect. No other text is clearly legible beyond the numerical coordinates and grid lines.


- page 60 -

This appears to be a grid map or chart with latitude/longitude lines. The visible numbers on the grid include 50°, 40°, and 30°. The grid is marked with numerous small dots and lines creating a complex coordinate system. Some areas of the grid have clusters of small numbers or dots, while other areas are relatively sparse. The image is a black and white document with varying degrees of darkness and fading, particularly towards the bottom and edges of the page.


- page 61 -

This image appears to be a plotting chart with various grid lines, coordinates, and a scale of statute miles at the bottom. The text I can discern includes:

PLOTTING CHART (on the right side vertically)

At the bottom of the chart:
Scale of Statute Miles (with measurements from 0 to 1000)

There are numerous numerical markings and grid coordinates across the chart, but many are too faint or blurry to read clearly. The chart seems to be a navigational or tracking document with latitude and longitude lines.


- page 62 -

This image appears to be a navigational or meteorological chart with latitude and longitude lines. The chart is filled with numerous numerical notations and grid coordinates. The numbers range from around -30 to 90 in various sections of the chart. The right side of the image is darker and appears to be partially obscured or shadowed. There are no legible words or sentences on this chart, only numerical coordinates and grid markings.


- page 63 -

This image appears to be a map or chart with numerous grid lines, coordinates, and numerical annotations. The document is a black and white image with various lines, numbers, and markings across the entire page. The numbers range from 0 to around 500, and there are multiple intersecting lines creating a grid-like pattern. The image looks like a technical or navigational chart, possibly related to meteorological, astronomical, or geographical data. However, due to the complexity and faintness of the markings, many specific details are difficult to read precisely.

No Case (Information Only)                                   8 February 1958
                                                              Micro, North Carolina

Ivan Sanderson Sees Green Fireball: On the night of Saturday, February 8, the well-known zoologist, author, W Star, and CSI Vice President, _______, was driving back to New York from the South, with three friends. At 10:35 p.m. they were heading northeast on Route 301 in southern North Carolina, and had just passed the tiny village of Micro (about 30 miles southeast of Raleigh). Robert Duncan, in the back seat, noticed a bright "peacock-green" luminous object rising behind the trees in the southwest and catching up with the car. A moment later the brakes were slammed on as it was seen by Ivan and Richard Florimont, in the front seat. Not quite one-third the size of a full moon, it had a blunt front and a tapering sharp tail, from which spurted a few orange sparks that forked like those struck from a flint. It appeared like a rounded, three-dimensional thing, not a mere glaring light. It passed over, to their left, and within four seconds was lost to view behind pine trees in the north-northeast. No sound was heard. Ivan had the impression that it was a good many miles away. (The appearance and horizontal course of this object seem to put it in the general class of enigmatic "green fireballs.")

Shimmering arcs and fiery curtains of red, green and white listed

or aurora borealis Monday night.

Sky-gazers throughout Fairborn and most of the nation observed the
Northern lights which normally are seen at high latitudes.

The lights were observed in points as scattered as Boston, New
York, Des Moines, Ia., Albuquerque, N.M., Tyler, Tex., Nashville,
Tenn., Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago and as far south as New Bern,
Fla.

One person living in the Wright View area called the Daily Herald
after noting the red sky to know if Fairborn had a big fire.
The unusually intense display had marred effect on radio transmission and telegraph wire. Radio hams in the Minneapolis area reported they were unable to operate during the display.

This appears to be a technical chart or map with radial lines and numerous numerical annotations. The chart is predominantly white/light gray with black/dark gray gridlines and text. The lines are arranged in a radial or circular pattern, with concentric arcs and radiating lines. Various numerical values are written at different points along the grid lines, ranging from what appear to be degrees or coordinates. Some location names are partially visible at the bottom of the chart, including "VLADIVOSTOK" and "MURMANSK", suggesting this might be a geographical or navigational chart related to a specific region.

[HEADER WITH ASTERISKS]
FEB 24, 1958 BETWEEN NAZARE AND SALVADOR (LORENZEO P. 143) 3 WITNESSES
DR. [REDACTED] A LAWYER IN SENAI'S NATIONAL DEPARTMENT
MANUEL MENDES AND A FRIEND ANTONIO DE ARAUJO WERE DRIVING BETWEEN NAZARE AND
SALVADOR, IN BAHIA. (ABOUT 1200 MILES FROM POINT PORTAN, BRAZIL) BETWEEN TWO
SMALL TOWNS, LAS TWO SMALL VILLAGES, SANTO ANTONIO DE JESUS AND CONCEICAO
ALMEIDA, AT 3:05 A.M., SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TWO VILLAGES, THEIR CAR BEGAN
COUGHING AND MISSING AND THEN ABRUPTLY THE MOTOR STOPPED DEAD. THE MEN
ATTEMPTED TO LOCATE THE TROUBLE, BUT TO NO AVAIL. THE NEXT INHABITED SPOT WAS
SOME DISTANCE AWAY, AND THEY DECIDED TO SLEEP AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD AND IN
THE MORNING, DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CAR.

IT WAS, THEN, THAT THEY SPOTTED A HUGE LUMINOUS OBJECT HOVERING OVERHEAD.
ACCORDING TO DR. [REDACTED] REPORT, *IT GLOWED WITH A STRANGE LIGHT WHICH
SEEMED FLUID; BETWEEN SILVER AND BLUE. AT FIRST IT WAS ONLY A LIGHT, BUT AS
IT APPROACHED, WE WERE ABLE TO DETECT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SOLID BEHIND
THE GLOW. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE TWO HEMISPHERES ON TOP OF EACH OTHER --
BETWEEN THEM A LUMINOUS DISK OR RING SPINNING AT HIGH SPEED. IT WAS THE
SOURCE OF THE BRILLIANT GLOW SURROUNDING THE WHOLE OBJECT. THE OBJECT CAME
SILENTLY TOWARD THE CAR UNTIL IT WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET FROM THE
OBSERVERS AND ABOUT NINETY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THEN IT DESCENDED IN A
CURIOUS MANNER AS THOUGH IT WERE A FALLING LEAF. IT STEADIED ITSELF AT ABOUT
ONE OR TWELVE FEET ABOVE GROUND, AND THE THREE MEN WERE ABLE TO DISCERN ITS
CONTOURS VERY CLEARLY. THE BOTTOM WAS SMALLER THAN THE TOP HEMISPHERE AND IT
WAS SLIGHTLY FLATTENED UNDERNEATH. ITS LUMINOSITY SPREAD IN A CURTAIN OF
LIGHT SUSPENDED BETWEEN THE UFO AND THE GROUND BELOW.

THE FRIGHTENED DRIVER, MENDES, GOT BACK INTO THE CAR, THE OTHER TWO, HOWEVER, DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE AND WALKED TOWARD THE STRANGE OBJECT. AS
THEY APPROACHED, THE ILLUMINATED AREA (ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF THE UFO) WHICH
APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 60 TO 75 FEET IN DIAMETER, THE OBJECT SUDDENLY TOOK OFF
IN A VERTICAL CLIMB. IT STOPPED AT ABOUT 600 FEET, AND MADE A TIGHT CIRCLE IN
THE SKY. ITS LUMINOUS FOCUS ON THE GROUND ROTATING AROUND ITSELF. THEN THE
SO-CALLED AGAIN AND TILTED FORTY-IVE DEGREES. IN THIS POSITION THE
ROTATING RING WAS MORE EASILY VIEWED AND DR. PEREIRA GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT
IT WAS NOTICED LIKE A COGWHEEL WHOSE INDENTATIONS APPEARED TO BE OBLIDUE
RELATIVE TO THE EDGE OF THE RING. MINUTES LATER THE OBJECT BEGAN TO MOVE
AGAIN IN A SERIES OF HIGH-SPEED MANEUVERS ACROSS THE SKY, SOMETIMES MOVING
VERTICALLY, SOMETIMES IN TIGHT CIRCLES AROUND THE CAR AND SOMETIMES IN
STRAIGHT LINES. IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. IN THE STRAIGHT LINE MANEUVERS IT
MOVED *MORE RAPIDLY THAN LIGHTNING,* BECOMING AT TIMES A SMALL DOT OF LIGHT IN
THE SKY IN A SPLIT-SECOND. THEN FOR A SECOND TIME THE OBJECT EXECUTED THE
NEAR-LEAFLIKE DESCENT, STOPPING ABOUT 9 TO 12 FEET FROM THE GROUND, WHEN THE
OBSERVERS TRIED TO APPROACH IT. THE OBJECT TOOK OFF VERTICALLY AT HIGH SPEED
AND WAS GONE. THE TIME WAS 4:35 A.M.

AT 5:20 A.M., THE OBJECT APPEARED FOR THE LAST TIME, AT A LOW ALTITUDE,
VERY IN COLOR WITH NO GLOW. IT WAS MOTIONLESS, TILTED TO ONE SIDE.
SUDDENLY IT SHOT UP AT TREMENDOUS SPEED AND VANISHED IN A SPLIT-SECOND.

ADAPTED TO START THEIR CAR, TO THEIR SURPRISE THE MOTOR FUNCTIONED AS
BEFORE, AND FURTHER STALLING, AND THE CAR MADE THE REST OF THE TRIP TO

UFO Sighting, 27 February 1958

Hq USAF (SAFGIC)                                                OCT 31 1966

Reference the attached letter from [redacted] reporting his observation which occurred on 27 February 1958. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mr. [redacted]

There have been many accusations made against the Air Force concerning our alleged official stand that "there just ain't no such thing." We have never made such a statement. Our official stand is that there has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as unidentified are extraterrestrial vehicles.

If you had reported your observation to the Air Force, our analysts and evaluators would have attempted to determine what you had observed. If we had been unable to find a logical answer, then your case would have been categorized as unidentified. The Air Force would not have made your name available to the press without your permission.

It would be extremely difficult at this late date to perform a comprehensive investigation on your observation. It will be filed with our 1958 cases for information purposes, however, it will not be considered a case. There were no UFO reports submitted to the Air Force for 27 February 1958.

Preface

The original intent of this collection of short reports was the presentation of preliminary data, to the U. S. National Committee for the International Geophysical Year, obtained by the Optical Satellite Tracking Program of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory with regard to the first artificial earth satellite launched by the United States on January 31, 1958.

At the present time, however, three more objects have been successfully launched into satellite orbits from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The collection has therefore been expanded to include such additional orbital information and analyses as could be put into usable form, as well as descriptions of the principal machine computation programs in use.

Since we are endeavoring to make these satellite data available as rapidly as possible to all scientists participating in the International Geophysical Year, we have of necessity included information of an extremely preliminary nature.
