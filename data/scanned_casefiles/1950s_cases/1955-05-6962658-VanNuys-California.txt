COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that this incident was caused by some type of unconventional act rather than a natural phenomenon.

2. No definite type characteristic could be placed on the sighting at the time of the occurrence.

3. Sighted being close to the San Fernando Valley Air Force Base, which is also a check point for traffic over the area, the possibility of a flight error cannot be overlooked.

4. Flight direction was a bearing in a general westerly direction in California. The observer was a reliable person and no explanation other than the possibility of a flight error has been presented.

5. When contacted via telephone on 20 May, 1955, source stated that object could have been any type object.
