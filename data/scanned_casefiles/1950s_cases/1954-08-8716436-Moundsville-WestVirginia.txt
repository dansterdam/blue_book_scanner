The text in the document is as follows:

"On August 19, 1954, my sister, cousin, and I were driving in a car between New Martinsville and Wheeling. There was a bright strange object in the sky. It was shaped like a discus and of a reddish-white color. It moved rapidly at high speed."

"The object maintained a fixed position for a few seconds. It then suddenly accelerated to the left and streaked out of sight with tremendous speed. It was visible for approximately one minute. I have never seen anything like it before or since."

The text in the document states:

This has got a most peculiar twist to it. The girls got almost hysterical and we put them on to where it was going, which was a digging in the hillside some way off.
Since then a have seen several of them watching this machine a well machine.
We might say a searchlight was used to illuminate them.

LAMES FOIL "CLUMSY" ESPIONAGE ATTEMPT
Stockholm, in English to Eastern North America, Aug. 24, 1954, 1200 GMT--E
A thoroughly clumsy attempt at espionage was described in yesterday's issue of the Danish newspaper POLITIKEN-BLADET. It took place on Aug. 24 at a military camp where a Polish guard on duty tried to coax military information out of a young Danish soldier. The guard, however, refused to be drawn in. He drove away in haste and sent in a report of the incident, giving away its license number. The completed investigation showed that the car belonged to the Polish legation in Copenhagen.

An offshoot of Mosjoen police force confirmed the fact that the two sisters, aged respectively 24 and 32 years, who are not believed to have understood the saucer land. 
According to them, the pilot wore an aviator's overall with no buttons. At the top of his head he had a kind of clear bowl. He got into the machine again, and took off fast and vertically. 
The ladies did not dare to get closer to the machine, and can give no further details. In spite of their statement, the local police will go tomorrow to the landing spot in the hope of finding some trace of the flying saucer.
