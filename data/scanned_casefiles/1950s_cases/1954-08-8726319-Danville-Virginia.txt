MYSTERY METAL IGNITES ROAD: Woodside, California - Officials and residents were baffled by a shower of bright metal which fell along Skyline Road, Aug. 27, 1954. The furore was triggered when a woman motorist saw a "field of fire" along Skyline Road. Firefighters found pieces of flaming metal scattered along the road where the metal burned into it and grass fires were started where the metal burned into the ground.

An observant resident, Enrico Miramontes, reported hearing a loud explosion about 4:15 P.M., but saw nothing.

According to U.P. release, intelligence officers and officials offered no solution for the white-hot pellets. San Mateo officials reported the pellets ranged in size from a 50 cent piece, and were scattered for about 200 yards. Inch deep holes in the road surface (a quarter of an inch across) were found, but they were completely regular and appeared to have come from a "cylindrical object."

An Air Force spokesman advanced the theory the metal came from jet planes, because pipes which reach extreme temperatures in flight. However, a check with air base officials reported no aircraft in the area, and a naval base spokesman and an unnamed informant who sent in the story said they knew nothing of any jets being in the vicinity.
