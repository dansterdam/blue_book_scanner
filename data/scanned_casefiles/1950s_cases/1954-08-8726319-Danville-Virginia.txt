Woodside, Calif

MYSTERY METAL IGNITES ROAD: Woodside, California officials and residents were baffled by a shower of white-hot metal pellets, Aug. 27, 1954. The furore was triggered when a woman motorist saw a "circle of fire" along Portola Road. Later firemen found scores of small pieces of flaming metal burning the pavement over an area about 70 by 250 feet. The blacktop bubbled where the metal burned into its and grass fires were started where the metal burned along the shoulders of the highway. A resident, Ignacio Miramontes, reported hearing a loud explosion about 4:15 P.M., but saw nothing.

According to U.P. release, "Metallurgists and AF officials offered no solution for the white-hot pellets." San Mateo officials reported the pellets ranging in size from a dime to a 50 cent piece, and according to who, the metal shower burned holes in the road surface a quarter of an inch deep. "I can't figure it out," he said. "It has me completely mystified." He said the metal scraps had irregular marking and appeared to have come from a "cylindrical object."

An Air Force spokesman advanced the theory, the metal came from jet plane exhaust pipes which reach extreme temperatures in flight. However, a check with air bases disclosed no military jet was in the bay area Friday. (Thanks to an unnamed informant who sent in the story from San Francisco Call Bulletin.)
