FLYING SAUCER THEORY EXPLODED:
MYSTERY OF BALL OF FIRE SOLVED
By JAMES ELLIOTT

Remember that blazing ball of
fire that streaked across the skies
of Virginia and North Carolina in
February?

At the time, the phenomenon
stirred many an imagination into
thoughts of flying saucers. And
recent discussions by the Air
Forces that there might be something after all, to those saucer
sorties, raised a few more eyebrows.

Despite those aviating and revelations, however, you can rest
assured that the very thing, detonate a fireball of February 18 was
but a meteor, according to a report made to The News Leader today, the American
Meteor Society definitely that the
earth definitely was a
meteor.

And - by taking - astronomical
data, and adding a few mathematical calculations, the society can
tell you just about anything you
would like to know about the
meteor.

BASED ON 100 ACCOUNTS
More data is based on more than
100 accounts by persons in the
States who saw the brilliant flash.
It first came into sight when,
it was 73 mi., in the air, the report noted. From that point, two
points in the sky at an estimated 251 miles a second
for 106 miles before burning out
over Virginia, about 12 miles
above a point six miles east and
one mile north of Fox Hill, Elizabeth City County, over lower
Chesapeake Bay.

Its remains, if any, apparently
fell into the bay, the report said,
and no fragments have been discovered.

The meteor left a train of smoke
and cloud, said the report, that lasted fully 15 minutes before disappearing.

"Had the fireball appeared at
night" the report continued, "it
would truly have been terrifying
from its brilliancy." The fireball
flashed into sight at 11:31 A. M.
and was visible to residents of the
States despite the clear height.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Area Air Force Base, California

REPORT NO.
CRN 7-3-52

PAGE   2   OF   2   PAGES

Description:

Pilots sighted an unidentified object flying at approximately the same altitude as their aircraft. No specific shape could be determined. The only noticeable feature was a bright light much like the headlight of a locomotive. Some objects projected no beam but seemed to glow within their own aerodynamic features were noted and the object left no visible trail or exhaust.

Path or Flight:

The object approached the observers' aircraft from a northerly direction on an apparent collision course. The object was at the same altitude as the aircraft. Lateral distance (slant range) was twenty (20) miles to the object. The object appeared to be fifteen (15) inches in diameter. It did not appear to have any definite or variable speed and moved across the sky very slowly. During those moments the object appeared to grow dimmer as it receded and brighter as it approached the aircraft. After crossing in front of the aircraft, the object continued on a direct course at an approximate speed of one hundred eighty (180) miles per hour. About seven (7) miles after appearing and brightening, it suddenly turned to an easterly heading, accelerated rapidly to an estimated eight hundred (800) miles per hour and disappeared, climbing at an angle of thirty (30) degrees.

Weather Conditions:

Degrees centigrade, visibility unlimited; broken stratus at eight thousand (8,000) feet; two hundred sixty (260) degrees at eight thousand (8,000) feet; two hundred eighty (280) degrees at fifteen (15) knots, two thousand (12,000) feet two hundred eighty (280) degrees. Ceiling unlimited. Smooth air mass with no turbulence during observing time which would cause any disturbance in the sky.

Comments of Preparing Officer:

Insufficient physical evidence is available (fragments or photographs) to completely identify object. Both observers are rated pilots with a good amount of flying experience. The evaluation of this report is toward an unknown aerial object. Another aircraft also reported the sighting of this object.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (Originator)   Wing Intelligence Officer     REPORT NO.    GTL, 3-52       PAGE    2   OF   2   PAGES
             Mather Air Forces Base,
             California

             Pilots sighted an unidentified object which at first was believed to be a
plane with one (1) landing light on or with a bright light in the nose.
Object first appeared to be between Stockton and Sacramento, California.
As the object approached the aircraft it appeared to become larger, brighter
and more yellow in color. As the object passed in front of the observing
aircraft the pilot stated that it was definitely not another aircraft.

Path of Flight:
             Object first came into view on an apparent collision course from a
northerly direction. At this time observing aircraft was at an altitude
of nine thousand (9,000) feet over HIAWATHA, California. Object contin-
ued on an apparent collision course for approximately eight (8) minutes
during which time at its closest from the observed (9,000) feet to approx-
imately eleven thousand (11,000) feet where it seemed to pick up speed,
was in an easterly direction and was lost from sight as observing air-
craft made a turn towards Sacramento California. Object was not sighted
again as observing aircraft left the area for a simulated bomb run on
Mather Air Force Base.

Weather Conditions:
             Weather in the area at the time of observation. Temperature twelve
(12) degrees centigrade, visibility unlimited; broken status at eight
thousand (8,000) feet. Winds aloft reported, eight thousand (8,000) feet,
eight (8) knots at two hundred (260) degrees; ten thousand (10,000) feet,
fifteen (15) knots at two hundred (260) degrees and twelve (12) degrees.
Thousand feet, twenty-five (25) knots at two hundred eighty (280) degrees.
No known meteorological or other conditions prevalent during time of obser-
vation existed. A balloon corolla in the evening left very clear skies.

Comments:
             No physical evidence is available (fragments or photographs) to con-
firm sighting. Both observers are rated pilots with a good amount of
flying experience. The evaluation of this report is twofold as another
aircraft also reported the sighting of this object.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was initiated by the telephonic request of Special Agent JAMES T BOGGS, DO 5, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio. This district was requested to investigate reports that a "ball of fire" was sighted near Norfolk, Virginia by the U.S. Weather Bureau.

AT NORFOLK, VIRGINIA

2. On 27 February 1951 inquiry at the offices of the United States Weather Bureau revealed that the only person known as Weather Bureau's Greensboro, North Carolina office Weather Bureau personal advisor that the sighting of an unidentified aerial object had been investigated by the U.S. Coast Guard at Norfolk on 18 February 1952.

3. On 27 February 1951, contact with Lt PAUL PETTIGREW of the U.S. Coast Guard, revealed that their office had noted as the coordinating agency for an air search an investigation following receipt of a report that a "jet plane" had exploded in flight over Whaleville, Virginia at about 1145 hours 18 February 1952. Review of the Coast Guard log book revealed the following sequence of events:

"18 February 1952

1145 hours - Received call from Langley AFB that a Mr. [redacted] at Whaleyville, Va. reported he saw a jet aircraft explode over Whaleyville at 1145 hours.

Helicopter landed and interviewed with [redacted] and further information.

1500 hours - Norfolk CAA reports that pilot of Eastern Air Lines Flight 602 reported he was climbing on a south heading just south of Lake Drummond on the Virginia State line and noticed a bright flash pass ahead and above his plane. Initial sighting was 30° above horizon and final sighting will 15 disappeared at a point 20° left of wing, at about 20° above the horizon. A trail of black smoke was left in the wake of the flash.
