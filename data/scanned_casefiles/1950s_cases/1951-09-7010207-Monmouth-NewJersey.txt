UNCLASSIFIED

For forty-five seconds after the initial sighting, the observer noted the object to be glaring in bright sunlight, hovering almost stationary in mid-air. However, the object then began to make an upward climbing motion and proceeded to rapidly accelerate, gaining altitude until the balloon was silhouetted against the sky. As the object gained speed, a light emanated from it, giving the "illusion of elongation" of the balloon-like shape. This "phenomenon" of balloons is a common occurrence with high-speed observed balloons.

In order to determine the identity of the object, a further check was made by the observers of the balloon release which took place at around 1710 hours the same day. It was found as a result of this investigation that the object had been a balloon and that the motion witnessed was consistent with what could be expected. It cannot be concluded that the object was definitely a balloon.

DETERMINATION OF FORMATION IDENTITY

4. Determination

At the Fort Monmouth Installation, the exhibits in question were made by students. They were taking a meteorological course. The exhibits would not constitute a security violation. The object in question was not definitely determined to be a balloon. The students were maintaining accurate records, but a curator.

While further follow up of this case would be desirable, inasmuch as it is felt that the object observed was in fact a balloon (in view of the information developed subsequently), and that the later acceleration and behavior observed is consistent with the characteristics of a balloon, no further investigation along these lines appears to be warranted. The operator who had more experience than the average student, was making a conscientious effort to determine the identity of the object.

On 10 September 1951, at about 11:30 PM, an Army officer and a civilian observer saw an unusual object in the sky. The object was described as being very bright and high-speed, moving in a northerly direction at an estimated altitude of 35,000 to 40,000 feet. It was tracked by radar and observed visually for about 2 to 3 minutes. The observers estimated the object's speed to be 1,800 to 2,400 miles per hour. 

The report provides details of the sighting, including the altitude, speed, and trajectory of the observed object. It also mentions that the object was tracked by radar and observed visually. The report concludes with a statement indicating that the weather conditions at the time of the sighting were favorable for observations.

III. CONCLUSIONS
a. The unidentified aircraft reported by the USAF pilots was probably a balloon-like object which the airport control tower observed before the pilots arrived in the area.
b. The high speed radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was not necessarily confirmed by a visual sighting of the aircraft.
c. The 1950 ELST radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a weather balloon.
d. The 1330 LEST radar sighting on 11 September 1951 remains unknown, but it was very brief and due to insufficient information, no conclusion as to the nature of the target can be reached. However, it is felt that there was a great deal of activity of unusual nature observed in the area.

UNCLASSIFIED
PORT MONMOUTH, NJ: WEEKLY - 10-11 September 1951

On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of incidents occurred in the area of Fort Monmouth. As initial sight ings of an unidentified object was made on a radar set. Soon after the radar sighting, two Air Force officers in a T-33 aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to intercept an unidentified object. Later several more radar sightings were reported.

STATUS INVESTIGATION:
A complete investigation of this incident was carried out and will be reported in Project Grudge Special Report No. 1. It has been tentatively determined that the radar sightings were probably caused by balloons that had been launched from the area. None of the radar sightings were close enough to permit visual identification. The operator who observed this incident returned the object was traveling over 700 mph because the radar set's automatic tracking would not follow the target. It is possible that the inability to track the object was due to his inability to properly operate the set under mental stress.

FORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY

12 September 1951

1. On 10 September 1951, an AN/MPG-1 radar set picked up a fast moving low flying object (exact altitude undetermined) at approximately 1140 hours northeast from this headquarters, at a range of approximately 27,000 yards. The target appeared to follow the coast line, the changing it is range only slightly all the while, at such a speed as to necessitate continuous tracking. The object was too fast to be tracked by SCR-584 radar, but in this case was too slow to be followed intensively. The target was lost to the Northwest at a range of about 15,000 yards.

This target also presented an unusually strong return for a large aircraft being operational in this locality. Several maneuvers beyond the normal flight patterns were observed. The observer concluded that it could not be a ship after he observed its extreme speed.

2. On 10 September 1951, 1515 hours, an SCR-584, serial number 133 tracked a target which moved about 35 miles in 15 minutes, giving an average speed of approximately 135 miles per minute or approximately 8,100 mph. (altitude approx. 93,000 ft.)

3. On 11 September 1951, 1030 hours, two SCR-584's serial numbers 217 and 215 picked up the same target northwest at an elevation of 1 degree 10 minutes and a range of 31,000 ft. The sets tracked it manually in a smooth and steady manner to a maximum rate altitude 31,000 ft) The sets tracked it automatically in a smooth and steady manner at an approximate speed of 700 mph. In this case however, both sets found it impossible to track the target in order to hold it accurately. The target was tracked in order to demonstrate the operators' ability to track a target, but the extreme speed of the aircraft made this impossible due to the limitation of the radar units. The operators, however, the echo signal occasionally fell off to a low or normal return volume. This change in signal indicated a possibly high and fast maneuver.

4. On 11 September 1951, at about 1330 a target was picked up on an SCR-584 radar set. Serial number 215, The target was approximately 10,000 yards at an elevation of 1 degree 45 minutes. This also presented an unusual maneuverability. The target ranged in, as close as 6,000 yards and then moved out as far as 10,000 yards. The operators concluded that the object could not be a normal jet aircraft.

It was at such a short range, however overcast conditions prevented such observation. Continuing to study conditions existing conditions the target was observed to be changing its elevation at an extremely rapid rate, the change being in excess of 1500 feet in a period of less than 10 seconds. It was therefore believed that the target encountered must have risen to an angle of approximately 1500 feet at which time it proceeded to descend, again at a rate of change of the target exceeding the added tracking ability of the SCR-584, so that the maximum range achieved was only 2,000 yards. It is therefore believed that a higher radar set capable of tracking the target to the maximum of the SCR-584 would have been required to continue the observation.

ON 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of both visual and radar sightings were reported from the Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, area.

1. INITIAL SIGHTING OF OBJECTS: At approximately 2235, a security guard at the Nike Ajax installation, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, reported sighting several bright unidentified objects in the sky to the southwest of the installation. He described the objects as circular in shape, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and traveling at a high rate of speed. At the same time, the guard reported that the objects had been picked up on the radar screen of the Nike Ajax installation and that the targets were traveling at an estimated speed of 500 to 700 mph. 

At approximately 2237, the guard reported that the objects had disappeared from both visual and radar observation. Several other security guards in the area also reported sighting the objects. The Nike Ajax crew chief and other personnel reported the sightings to the information center at the Fort Monmouth Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories.

At approximately 2240, the objects reappeared on the radar screen of the Nike Ajax installation and were again observed visually by the security guard. The objects were tracked intermittently by radar until approximately 2305 when they disappeared from both visual and radar observation. The total time of observation was approximately 30 minutes. The objects were estimated to have traveled a distance of 50 to 75 miles.

At an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet, the objects were observed to make several extremely sharp turns and maneuvers which could not be attributed to any known aircraft. The objects appeared to be under intelligent control. The size and speed of the objects eliminated the possibility that they were balloons or similar objects.

In an attempt to intercept the objects, an F-47 aircraft was scrambled from the New Castle County Airport, New Castle, Delaware. However, the objects disappeared from both visual and radar observation before the F-47 could make contact.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO. 13-Z-63

PAGE 2 of 2 PAGES

On 10 September, Major âââ and 1st. Lt. âââ of the 119th Fighter Interceptor Squadron of the Air Defense Command, Rudd Army Air Force Base, New Jersey, these pilots were scrambled to intercept an unidentified object over the Monmouth County area.

They acquired the object in a diving turn to the west, descending to an altitude of about 16,000 feet. They closed the object to about 600 feet behind and to the right of the object. Thereafter, he tried to keep a course paralleling, but above, that of the object.

As soon as Major ââ watched completed his radio check, he was notified of the streamer of the object and began firing. The object made a turn together while it climbed at a speed estimated to be about 50-60 miles before it disappeared.

The object was in control of the T-33 jet for about two minutes, and the object covering a distance of less than a minute. As to the weather and description of the object are unknown.

In the same date a radar station at Ft. Monmouth reported two targets that were unidentified, traveling very high, and giving returns that could not be explained as being equipment malfunction, erroneous propagation, or anything but actual aircraft. The pilots could not give any more information on these radar observations because of the restricted communication during the incident.

SUMMARY: On 10 September, Major REDACTED and Lt. REDACTED were participating in a training flight from Dover AFB, Delaware to Mitchell AFB, New York (direct), when they reported to witness an unidentified object (UFO) below their aircraft. The time was 1135 EDT, and the weather was 5 VFR. When sighted, the object was estimated to have a diameter of about 50,000 feet, the pilots immediately made a diving turn in his F-84 and followed and turned the object until 1200 EDT when it disappeared. 
Both pilots observed the strange object, which appeared to be the size of 2-3/16 inch master at 8000 feet (50,000 feet) diameter, disregarded in flight with no visible means or propulsion, and shiny silver in color.
At 1210 EDT a radar station at an undisclosed, high speed (above 700 mph) object in approximately the same location.
This headquarters has no information regarding natural phenomena, experiments or guided missiles that could have caused the observations.
Request USAF evaluation of incidents be furnished this headquarters.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DATE OF INFORMATION: 23 SEPTEMBER 1951
PLACE: MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY
EVALUATION: D-6
SOURCE: FAYE

"The results of the investigation of sighting reports from Monmouth reveal the following: At approximately 5:30 PM, 23 September 1951, the pilot of a Pennsylvania Central Airlines plane reported seeing a large unidentified object while flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet over Asbury Park, New Jersey. The object was described as being metallic in appearance, cigar-shaped, and approximately 30 feet long. The pilot reported that the object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, far in excess of the speed of the aircraft, and that it exhibited a pulsating motion. Although the pilot attempted to obtain a closer look at the object, it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

The fact remains that one experienced and observant witness was present and saw an object traveling more than 700 mph on 23 September in the New Jersey area."

AIR INTELLIGENCE UNCLASSIFIED REPORT

1. Item listed in paragraph 1 of initial report from Pt. Monmouth were students, with the "top section of objects" that he had a knowledge of military aircraft and/or other technical matters exceeded past experience in any identification made. Further states observed carrying objects that were not similar to any observation ever made.

2. Item listed in paragraph 2, initial Pt. Monmouth report, was later identified as the reflections on water from airplane running lights.

3. Radar sets at Pt. Monmouth were in almost constant mechanical condition. However, the objects could not be distinguished on this radar and were more clear to the visual observation than to electronic surveillance and/or control.

4. It varies with paragraph 3, above, in fact that the Pt. Monmouth 1/0 called for action on the morning of 19 September asking if they had been tracking these unidentified objects and were advised negatively. But would not grand any further information although admitted the objects being there.

General
A. Reference to weather effecting radar
The following information was obtained from the weather bureau:
On a weather map of September 10,1951, 10 ser, 1951, a westerly winds, a high pushing out off the coast extending for at least 100 miles north and south of Fort Monmouth area. No precipitation for 600 miles in any direction from Fort Monmouth. A few scattered high cirrus clouds at approximately 25,000 ft. No significant inversion below 16,000 ft. An inversion at 16-17,000 ft of 3Â°C/thousand increase. An Air was quite moist up to 15,000 ft - no water droplets. No inversion above 17,000 ft up to tropopause (47,000) Temperature 7,000 was - 67Â°C a total inversion of 2Â°C up to 63,000 ft. Temperature decreased from -65 to -75,000 rapidly to -3Â°C. Didn't get good sounding 2200 EST, however, no significant change occurred - nothing that would give erroneous radar signals.
Weather report at 0512, 11 September 1951. Indicates an upper front dissipated in the area West of Highlands. This front carried weak showers which would appear all along the coast (along a line extending from Sandy Hook to La Guardia). There was a very pronounced inversion at 1000 between 2000 and 2500 ft of about 3Â°C/1000 ft increase in temperature. Within 75 miles of Fort Monmouth at 1000 there were brief showers (small amount of precipitation traces in the order of 1/100 inch). Water droplets 5,000 - 8,000 ft. Stratis 5-500 deep at 10-11,000 ft. Sounding was ended at 12,000 ft. In general cumulus clouds with considerable density were encountered.. clouds with water droplets at 10,000 ft at 1000 lowering sto 2000 ft at 1600.

Dr. Herbert S. Bennet, EMC, Fort Monmouth, N.J.
Statement of Dr. Bennet
EMC is interested in countering airborne devices. They are limited in scope of operation to anything that can be countered from a ground installation. Their operations pertain to Army operation.
Major Martin, observer at Twin Lights, heard pilots' comments on radio at his station. When Bennet heard via commercial radio that pilots observed an object, he contacted Martin to see if an echo was received on radar scope.
Dr. Bennet stated that EMC (Electronics Warfare Corps) was not operating or performing tests that would cause phenomenon as picked up by radar scopes.
Dr. Bennet also stated that he was not aware of other projects that could cause these radar sightings.
When questioned as to date, Dr. Bennet stated that the incident happened the day before he visited Major Martin. The radio report was on the same day that he made his visit to Major Martin who was in charge of a CPS-6B radar installation. When queried as to possible causes of such sightings, he suggested several possibilities:
1. Constant altitude balloon: In order to maintain constant altitude during night and day operation (diurnal variants) it is necessary that the balloon drop ballast at night. If for some reason or other, a faulty release prevented dropping of ballast during night, the balloon would float to a low altitude. This would cause the balloon to define on the top which would make it look like a saucer shape when looking down on upper surface. The possibility of the pilots looking down on the object just as the faulty mechanism released the ballast would indicate an increase in vertical velocity. This balloon could be either a General Mills or NYU project. It was Dr. Bennet's belief that this was the cause of the radar sightings.

- page 37 -

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, containing descriptive text about a balloon observation.

OCR Output:
that is the balloon was 1000-2000 ft altitude that a PPi scope would not 
the balloon having the velocity caused by the horizontal components of wind.
Therefore, it is not expected that any faulty ballast release would result in
high horizontal velocities. His final analysis was that if high horizontal
velocity were indicated on the scope that this would not be the result of a balloon.
Dr. Behmer was queried on signal strength of a balloon and would it give
signal strength of a B-29 or B-35 at 20,000 yds. He stated that if the balloon
was painted silver as many of them are and it was at an altitude of 5000'or hg
higher, that signal response would be equal to that of a B-29 or B-35 at 20,000 ft.
His comment was that in general these balloons were used for soundings of between
30,000 and 110,000 ft (extent of Benet's knowledge). He also stated that sun
could make a balloon look as if it were oscillating.
2. Combined meteorological and oblique incident wave front.
A wave front such as this could give a signal response giving great
apparent speed on a radar scope, even though the actual speed of this wave is
low.

Private
SSN 3952, Fort Monmouth
They require that as a student must learn how to repair, adjust, and operate
radar equipment. Started radar course 7 May 1951. Previous experience is that of
a radio repair man. Service dates back to Dec 1950. Graduated from radio and
television school (Coyne, in Chicago)

Story as given by Private
One Tuesday (not certain of day of date) morning SCR-584A station #315 having
a maximum range of 70,000 yds and capable of added tracking up to 30,000 yds
picked up an object, altitude 9-(16-20) miles, azimuth range of aircraft was 20,000
yds and elevation of 800 miles. azimuth 16-15 degrees. Had trouble keeping object
on elevation. Object faded intermittingly. The time was approximately 10-10:30.
Time on scope was 5 minutes maximum. Believed this was a good radar day. Blip
looked good - good return. PPI gave good bright spot of approximately 1/3 inch
and was well defined. Subject known somewhat anomolous propagation. Subject stated
that PPI - saw same object that day. 

Remarks:
This set will track up to a speed of approximately 700 mph. A plotting board
is not normally used in this particular training course. Antenna is usually
checked by sighting on Shrewsbury water tower. Prior to sighting instructor
mal-adjusted the radar set, thus setting up a problem for the students. It was
necessary for to adjust the klystron, receiver, magnetrons. Working
schedule was 7:30 to 5:30 and leaves area for chow by 11:20. Believes he went
off this set on the 14th Sept. Operator believes set was in good working order
since commercial aircraft were sighted and tracked prior to sighting of object.

Private Juan ---- , SSN 1952, Fort Monmouth
Private Juan was a member of a radar training detachment at Fort Monmouth, N.J. He started this course 7 May 1951 and has been in the service since Dec 1950. His course on the SCR-584, was completed approximately 14 September 1951. His work to date in radar encompassed operational and maintenance procedures on SCR-584, MPG-1 and TPL. Has had previous radio and television training in N.Y.

Has operated and performed all maintenance functions on set No. 315, SCR-584. 
He is a member in the same crew as Pvt. - Believes he is capable and knows what a return of an aircraft looks like. The opinion of the interrogator is that he is not too familiar with aircraft designations and he stated that a DC-4 has two engines, however he gives indications that he can distinguish between reciprocating an jet aircraft. He was outside the van working on the console of another unit when he picked up object. He did not observe any sightings. 

He was told by another member of the crew that Allen's observed on his radar set a fast moving object at 1500 yds, altitude was north of radar set location (azimuth 280Â°). Direction was low, just above tree level. Went out of van and visually sighted two jets, silver in color, headed east. Opinion of - was that he saw a jet. He stated that the radar set was in good working order. He stated that he saw a similar object to that seen by - at 800 miles elevation and 23,000 yds range, azimuth 338Â°. Could not recall time or date.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image:

Private was a member of a radar training detachment and stationed at Fort Monmouth. He had a background in that he was a student majoring in mathematics at MIT and was to have graduated in the class of 1951.

Story as given by Private: Private stated that Mr. ___, an instructor, came out to the set he was working on and instructed him to look out for fast moving objects. He called Mr. ___ shortly after and told him he saw a fast travelling object. This observation was taken as a joke at first by Mr. ___ Private could not remember the date of this observation, except that it was in the morning and it might have been observed on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, possibly 11 or 12 September.

Private stated that his set was working satisfactorily and that he picked up the objects at 5700 mils (azimuth) and had a good return on the range scope. He put the set into automatic track and noted that the object travelled in an erratic manner. It was always in range and in the N-NE quadrant. The range was about 20,000 yds and never less than 15,000 yds. Always received a strong echo and wasn't bothered with fading. The object was extremely maneuverable. Private estimated that the speed was 500 mph. When questioned as to what he knew of anomalous propagation, he indicated that he knew of this phenomenon but believed there was no indication that weather conditions were negative this particular day for such propagation. He also stated that the signal strength was very strong and there was no variation of amplitude. He couldn't say how fast the object was climbing but estimated that the rate of climb was 9000-27000 ft per minute. He stated that he thought the object had high acceleration.

For the period from 7 September 1951 to 10 September 1951, the matter of sightings of unidentified flying objects was investigated . The observer's report contained the following details:

At approximately 2200 hours on 7 September 1951, the observer sighted a strange light in the sky. The light appeared to be stationary at first, but then it started moving in various directions, alternately fast and slow, for a period of about 15 minutes. The light was observed to be about the size of a star, but much brighter. There were no other objects or lights visible in the sky at the time. 

The report states that the observer was a reliable person, and that he was certain that the object he observed was not an aircraft, balloon, or any other known object. However, the report concludes that the object observed was likely to have been a meteor or some other natural phenomenon, and that there was insufficient evidence to determine its exact nature.

The report does not contain any photographs or other visual evidence of the observed object.

On 13 September 1951, at about 1930 hours, a tracked car and a pilot car were observed traveling at a high rate of speed near Monmouth, New Jersey. The pilots reported seeing a silvery object in the sky which was stationary. The object was first observed to be west of the car and was at an elevation of approximately 10,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter. The object was observed to be stationary for several minutes, then it began to move very rapidly in a straight line toward the southwest. It was observed to be going at an extremely high speed and was lost from sight in approximately 10 seconds. This sighting proved to be a worthwhile balloon, for it was determined that at 2330 hours on 13 October 1951, there was a weather balloon launched from an area near Monmouth, New Jersey. The object sighted on 13 September 1951 was probably this weather balloon observed in its last stages of ascent.

On 18 September 1951, at about 1330, a target was detected on an SCR-584 radar at Camp Evans, New Jersey. The target was moving at an extremely high speed and was observed at an elevation of 85,000 feet. The target was tracked for about 20 minutes, during which time it descended to an altitude of 60,000 feet. The target then accelerated and climbed back to an altitude of 85,000 feet. The radar operators were unable to establish any visual contact with the target. It is highly probable that this is an example of an anomalous propagation, which is frequently encountered at elevations above 50,000 feet. At present, the true nature of this phenomenon is not clearly understood, however, since no more physical evidence is available, the case must remain unresolved.

SUBJECT: Sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, 10 September 1951

On 10 September 1951, our information indicates that two hollow balloons were sighted at 1:12 north of Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The balloons were 75 degrees east at an elevation of 30 degrees, northeast. This location is in the bay north of Sandy Hook. No reply was received.

Following is a verbal transcript of an interrogation of Firr, the intercepator Staff Dover, Delaware. The interrogation was a comple dished by Lt. Col. R.H. Rosengarten and 1st Lt. Jerry R. Cummings of the 113th fighter wing Group, Air Tactical Intelligence Center, USAF Station 13L. 

The investigation states that at 0110 hrs on 7 Sep 1951, an unidentified aircraft was observed by the subject officers. While observing the object, information was available from this interrogation as not sufficient in regard to the means whereby the information became available to the military. This message states that important information is considered to have become available from various telephone calls concerning the incident.

The interrogation follows:
1. The object was first sighted over Sandy Hook, and the information available to the interrogators was verified as true and complete.
2. The question of communication of the information as examined follows: between 1125 and 1130 on 7 Sep 1951, after the sighting of the object, the interrogators communicated with the Air Force Station at Montauk, Long Island, and were informed that a bright light had been observed in the vicinity of Sandy Hook during that time period.
3. It is believed that the initial sighting was transmitted over a radio telephone by a 110t unidentified object making 7-300mph because at this time Gambrith observed an unidentified object making observations giving heading of 1200.
4. It is believed, giving heading of 1200, that the information received, giving heading of 1200 and an invert antly incorrect geographic fix of Seaside Heights, that this information was obtained through telephonic communication, and may have acknowledged although this is not certain in the initial telling of the object's sighting.
5. The officers are advised that they could not long the object as this may subject the officer or persons involved to various unwarranted accusations, as follows:
6. The driver of a carryall may have heard them say that they sighted the object as very bright and may have been driving to the area. The name of the driver is not known, and it is unknown that he could hear their conversations.
7. The officers did not render a report of the sighting to the operations officer as directed, nor did they receive a debriefing.

The officers advised Col Sproul and Col Spain, operations concerning officers on General Mindle's affair that they had seen a very high speed unidentified aircraft and were initially concerned, but stated concerning action "their only response was laughter." This incident occurred at 1200, approximately, 29 Sept 1951.

The civilian stated that he contacted Mr. Barron, public information officer, in order to furnish the location, ground track, description, time of sighting, duration of sighting, and conditions under which he did not initially report the incident, as he then stated that this sounded "like good newspaper story material" and that "he was traveling a newspaper man (newspaper man for revotion) over to operations to get the story from Lt."

It was then stated that this civilian did not wish to cooperate in any way in identifying or establishing the individual who was to be as Mitchell's and was told some hours later that the telephone call from Lt. Barron a "means of identifying or establishing the individual who was to be established." This individual was to come to the PIO office, but failed to find, and did not subsequently report this incident.

The civilian introduced himself as a newspaper man, name Steve Karon, and stated that what he witnessed had been the security officer's craft, but failed to find, and did not subsequently report this incident.

It was noted that the civilian was informed that he must call Lt Barron to ascertain the officers' names at the PIO office, but succeeding the officers' mess, the conversation ended, indicating that he was falling to locate Lt Barron as was expected.

It was noted that the civilian stated that he was cleared to receive the information on the sighting on the operations map and showed the geographic location of the sighting. Tracing the elapsed time, the color shape they were, and that the weather officer corroborated it.

It was what he thought he had seen, and was told that it was can object sighted.

Then the civilian asked if it was a flying saucer, and again stated that he did not know more than that he saw the balloon, and was told no, that the weather balloons cannot travel so fast as the object he saw.

At this point an unidentified civilian, carrying a 7/16 flash gun and with lens and bellows on a tripod, approached and stated that he was assisting the two civilian engineers quoted, but that they organized no effort to take a picture.

Second picture was taken of Lt.Lt * * * in front of Captain (my office) as a table with the men. The unknown captain did not wish to have his name used, but consented to appear. Lt. left Mitchell for Dover that evening.

On 11-12 Sept 1951, exact date indeterminable at this moment. 
RAEAF called Lt. at Dover regarding information pertaining to inform him to Dover. He was sorry not to be able to discuss the matter with them but that he passed them to USFI for clear action. Lt. Payne later reported that he thought he distinguished wire-tap beeps, and that he received clearance, but offered to check on possibility of obtaining additional tapes. He called ZANY, who called USAF, and the ass was rather friendly in his reference, although the advice was forthcoming. 
Later, a Lt. East at Dover received a call in operations from someone who said he was not there.
On 17 SEPT, READY ordered Maj and Lt to NewBURGH. About 20 September, 1950, Robert Johnson of Republic Aviation called and made appointment for to discuss the incident they had reported. Maj said that he was happy than he couldn't discuss one further, for him that the incident never happened.

About 20 September, 1950, READY called ZANY, and EADY advised the Dover base CO, and EADY stated that Robert Johnson's questions were unauthorized to discuss the incident with Lt. and Maj. This discussion proceeded further. Shapes, altitudes, and headings she made during sighting. The color was reddish orange, and she felt as if the radar sets picked up what she saw, but her set showed nothing. She stated weather control had made the observations, and that Brewster was studying the matter, that USAF and USRRI had questioned him, and the Brewster thought the objects were electrically propelled. Brewster cited information that he had received similar reports previously, some of which he thought the objects were electrically propelled.
Brewster cited incidents made of Lt. or Major concerning possible landing of Sept 1951.

4. It is perhaps worth mentioning that the additional information received is that the officers have expressly requested there be no publication of names of persons questioning, except that only quotations to Sawworth have been published. His speed is quoted."

Text from the document:

The air force investigation regarding the sighting is to be considered as follows. This sighting was reported to the air force intelligence by Col N Monmouth, New Jersey. The incident occurred on 23 October 1951 and was immediately reported. Col N stated that his attention was directed to the sky in the neighborhood of his location where he observed a luminous object maneuvering in the sky. He described the object as white in color and traveling at a high rate of speed, making a zigzag course. The object was observed for approximately 15-20 seconds. The report indicates that Col N is a reliable and trustworthy observer. The report originates from F S.G. and is a receipt by the chemical intelligence center. Therefore, a preliminary analysis has not yet been completed due to the fact that this report has just been received and an incomplete study of the informations has been made and is reserved for the full investigation. This sighting was sent here from AFOIA/TC.

This report concerns a detailed investigation of a reported observation of an unidentified flying object near Monmouth, New Jersey, on September 7, 1951. The decision was made to conduct a full investigation, as the sighting was reported to be of an unusual nature. Evaluations and opinions were formed based on the information gathered from the witnesses and related circumstances. Investigation determined that the object observed was not a known man-made device, and the witness statements were found to be credible. However, the exact nature of the object could not be established. It is believed that the object observed was a natural phenomenon, though the exact explanation remains unclear.

Transcription of the text in the document:

This is an actual case report taken from the files of Project Blue Book. The case is still classified as "unidentified" by the Air Force. This is an authentic account of the incident as submitted by the investigator.

The incident occurred on the evening of July 14, 1951, at approximately 9:00 PM in Monmouth, New Jersey. The observer, a professional man, was standing outside his home when he observed an unidentified object in the sky. 

He described the object as approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter, round, and metallic in appearance. It was first observed to the Northeast and was moving in a Southwesterly direction at an estimated speed of between 600 to 800 mph. The object was observed to be slightly above the horizon and was clearly visible against the darkening sky. 

The observer stated that the object appeared to have a glowing or fluorescent type of illumination, not unlike the glow of hot metal. It was also noted that the object was completely silent, and appeared to be under intelligent control. After being observed for approximately 1 minute, the object rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The observer estimated the object was observed over a distance of from 5 to 7 miles. 

This is a rather unusual case in that the observer was a professional man, fully capable of making accurate observations. The Air Force investigator was impressed with the sincerity and apparent reliability of the witness. The investigator felt that the object could not have been any known type of aircraft or natural phenomenon. The case was therefore classified as "unidentified".

III. CONCLUSIONS
A. The 115 was radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was most probably a balloon launched by the Wright Field laboratory for a routine weather observation.
B. The 1050 was radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a weather balloon.
C. The 1236 was radar sighting on 11 September 1951 which was determined to be a weather balloon.
It was probably possible that all three sightings were the same type of aircraft, namely weather balloons, since there was a pronounced radar activity and the weather at the time indicated weather conditions suitable for this type of aerial vehicle.

"NEW YORK CITY INCIDENT REGARDING STRANGE PHENOMENA OBSERVATION

1. ON 7 SEPTEMBER 1951, WEATHER WAS FAIR; TEMPERATURE WAS IN THE 70'S. ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVER, THE UNUSUAL PHENOMENA OBSERVED OCCURRED FROM 2130 TO 2145 HOURS. WITNESS WAS VERIFIED BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS. 

2. WEATHER REPORTS INDICATE THAT A COLD FRONT WAS IN THE AREA AND HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH AT 2130 HOURS. ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, HE OBSERVED FOUR BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT WERE NOT FLASHING IN THE SKY. THESE LIGHTS WERE HEADING IN A NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION. 

3. WITNESS ESTIMATES THAT THE SIZE OF THE LIGHTS WERE ABOUT 2 TO 3 FEET IN DIAMETER AND WERE SPACED ABOUT 5 TO 6 FEET APART. WITNESS REPORTED THAT THE LIGHTS WERE TRAVELLING AT A RATHER HIGH SPEED AND WERE MAKING NO NOISE. WITNESS STATED THAT THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE OF A VERY BRILLIANT NATURE AND SEEM TO BE OF THE SAME TYPE OF SHAPE.

4. UPON FURTHER OBSERVATION, WITNESS NOTICED THAT THE LIGHTS DID NOT DIM OR INCREASE IN BRIGHTNESS DURING THE OBSERVATION. HE ALSO STATED THAT THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE IN PERFECT FORMATION, FLYING LEVEL WITHOUT ANY WAVERING OR BLINKLING. THERE WAS NO TRAIL OR EXHAUST OBSERVED.

5. ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THIS SIGHTING OF THE OBJECTS LASTED APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES. THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL WAS NORTHWEST. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NO PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN OF THE INCIDENT."

SUMMARY: The finding of a gain instrument of 120 inches diameter, spherical in shape, was reported on 15 to 20 September 1951, approximately 5 miles southeast of Monmouth, New Jersey. This is significant. Notice that the reports are radically different, and it is the opinion that consequents of fire presents by the USAF ITEM 2, does not mean that associated USAF Item 1. 2 says they the fact which might be a function of about 115 degrees and strange circumstantially to discuss with the similar instrument. This could not be traced to that of the object reported by Major and there is no more significant information to report of USAF Item 2, subparagraph 1. 

Reference: paragraph 2 starting on 10 September 1951, 1215 hours. At an elevation of 3,900 feet before search target, etc. At is an evaluation that the target was of an electrical nature rather than physical. Certain data shows the altitude in order to aid in estimating the attitude of the balloon which is lighting along its path. The real was formed by several officers at a risk of $1 a round concerning this target. It is a significant feature here which time in later with the indication of fading to in order our paragraph 3. 

Paragraph 3: On 11 September 1951 at 1550 hours. The SAM #4 Serial was picked up the same target north of Lt. Bernard's at an altitude of 16,000 to 20,000 ft. The interesting part of this sighting is that it was noticed by ALONG, which was traced to newspapers. It was estimated that the altitude was 16,000 ft. The details are that to - said an elongated balloon, with a frame of we other material and a frame of unknown circular shape in the center.

Moreover, too much time had elapsed to expect the pilots memory to recover the details necessary for further evaluation. The two photos, however, did not materialize. There is the possibility, and to what extent it is not known, that the individual was actually in the process of taking pictures, but because of excitement or unfamiliarity with operation, failed to do so. The story was verified, questioned, analyzed, discussed, and the pilots remained simply bewildered of the details which they had sighted. However, certain circumstances indicated that the complete details which they claimed to have seen and they were interrogated at great length concerning the circumstances whereby this report substantiates the flying object they saw, reached the press and also a request was made for investigation of the base PIO officer at Mitchell Dr. Forman said, a Major Warren, in order to clarify his part in this publicity.

Failure to take corrective action is an indication. 1st Bennett was interrogated concerning possible activities of a counterintelligence station in which it works which might have an effect of giving spurious signals to radar stations covering the area. His answers to these proposals were unsatisfactory.

Cabell himself that evening. The airplane was chartered because although the signal strength was not sufficient to make up to Washington, the mission was very urgent to provide information. It could have been necessary to wait until the next day for other transportation.

Agencies contacted with this respect were Gen Hills, a Mr. Calpin in Minneapolis, Minn., a Mrs. Swenden of the Signal Corps Department of the Army Pictorial Cen ter, Chap Lain of the Office of Naval Research, Major Lickenna of Monty Fly Project in the Pentagon, and others incidental in discovering the identity of these project actors. The weather bureau was contacted for the weather reports. Certain fort personnel were contacted to determine whether any reports from the public concerning the sightings were reported. Reports indicates that there were no significant sightings which could be verified. These results were negative. Persons contacted includes Lt. Wadsworth, Eastern Air Defense Command, USAF Officer, at the Pentagon; Col. Gerry Corman, J-3 Reporting Officer; Lt. Col. Hoster, Command Post Deputy; and persons in the message centers.

There are counter-indications that it is an attempt by these two officers to gain publicity in that the permission by the pilots to Edinworth were considered by the editor and it was suggested that the pilots were excited in describing something which they believed to exist from the sound of their voices. A ground track was established by reference to interrogation of a coast made by airborne by Lt. It is believed that the ground chart which he reported on that map is correct as the pilots considered it. No definite evidence was given as to whether the pilots are correct but only as they consider it. The map cross-section by observation from greater altitude against geographic points on the ground. Upper limited range could thereby be established. A size was reported 30 to 50 ft. in diameter is not a fixed or reliable value. It will admit a larger size even up to half dimensions. As to speed, they could not fix a value. They gave only their ground track against in about two minutes. This shape oblateness appeared the color silver. There were no more observations which we could offer the staff. At the time of this recording, conclusions are something as follows: From the interrogation of Lt. O_____, the C-33 pilot, (a) the subject was circular in shape camouflaging after banking to elliptical. Conclusion: Oblong spheric in shape the outline back is turningColor. The object was silver in color. Pilot was firm that the object did not reflect the sunlight brightly. Conclusion: That with an allowance for misinterpretation, the object makes good speeds greater than 500 mph. (b) The object cannot be fixed for size except within the lower limit.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the criteria used to evaluate reported sightings of unidentified flying objects.

The text from the document is as follows:

"The diameter is 33 ft. diameter and appears to be 17 seconds of arc in diameter. (b) The time of lighting was 19:05 EDST and was observed until 19:17 EDST, or 10 September 1951.  However, all the foregoing observations concerning the conclusions from the interrogation of Lt. __________ are in the assumption that it is impossible to demonstrate this criteria necessary to establish their sighting as one of a balloon.  Now these criteria are considered to be something like the following: 

a. Opportunity - that is the presence of a balloon in that
geographic area.
b. Similarity - that is points of similarity between balloons and observations made.
c. Absence of a negative component - that is, the pilots themselves verified as a balloon or the subject who were viewing from the ground did not see a balloon, however, they could be influenced upon.

It is believed that essentially that these factors would effect the decision.  Now as to opportunity, we have information that the Evans Signal Laboratory released two balloons at 11:12 EDST on September that these balloons were in the air with 12:12 MST of 10 September and that they were at 164,000 ft and the diameter of the balloons at sunset was approximately 377. It is to be noticed that Evans Signal Laboratory is located at Belmar, N.J. It is considered that opportunity is presented in the time element and in geographic location regarding points of similarity the following must be considered:

Considering that the pilots disregarded radically, interrogations of A-2 of the 11th and interrogations by AHTC personnel as in their opinion that they are not sure or more than this fact that the"

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

Object was always on their left and that they did not or did assume a parallel trajectory. The pilot particularly pointed this is to say that the object was going in the same direction as the aircraft was turning; and that the object is following "the same direction as the T-33 aircraft" was turning; and that the object is following "the same direction as the T-33 aircraft" was turning. 

The pilots said that it is always leading the aircraft, that is, out of phase with it, or that the object is traveling in phase inside the circle of the aircraft and indeed that if may even be stationary inside the circle of the aircraft.

It is also pointed out that the interpretation that the object always any on the left or that the pilots may be that, the object was a balloon stationary inside their turning circle. It is also to be noted that the pilots are not sufficiently sure if this ground radar to engage this and a calculation concerning what the altitude of a balloon that we are necessary and impossible to give.

In fact, there is indication that the object did not follow the allowed ground track of the balloon and that it was observed to move ten nautical miles in two minutes, or five nautical miles per minute or 300 knots per hour, if one takes the extreme factor between the two observations of ground track. A point of similarity is that balloons are always painted for radar purposes when released from balloons. So it is reported by the pilot. A point of significance is the shape viewed under proper circumstances that the balloon might have a quite erratic spatial shape. In the light of this information, it is considered that there is strong possibility that the sighting was that of a balloon.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Statement of Sgt._________, 359th Med. Disp., Biggs AF Base, El Paso, Texas:

On 13-5-51 at about 0630 hours, I observed a bright light, approximately a mile and a half to the east of my residence. When it came down to my yard, there was a very bright right light, almost dazzling. I was inside my window when I saw this bright object. It was bright silver in color and circular in shape. It remained in this position for about 5 to 10 seconds, then it quickly ascended in a northeast direction at a high rate of speed to about 10,000 to 12,000 feet and disappeared from sight.

I did not hear any noise. It did not appear to make any unusual maneuvers. From the time I first observed the object until it disappeared, was approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The light was so bright that it was difficult to look at it. The size of the object was approximately 12 to 15 feet in diameter.

One time (about 45 minutes to 1 hour after I first sighted the object) at approximately 0730 hours, I again observed the object. This time it appeared on the horizon at about 12 to 15 degrees. It appeared to be descending at a very high rate of speed. It was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile north of where I had first observed it. It returned to a relatively position.

The light was so bright that I was unable to see any shape or form, but the object appeared to be circular. I did not hear any noise nor see any smoke nor sparks as if it was on fire. There was no sound. This light observed this second time lasted for approximately 12 to 15 seconds before it ascended and again disappeared from sight.

At 0430 I spoke to my neighbors to use their telephone. I phoned the base to report what I had seen. The Base Operations Officer went to the tower and according to him the tower operators was not aware that there was anything observed.

Witnesses other than myself were my wife, Mrs._____, and my neighbor.

Transcribing the text in the document:

On Aug. 28, 1951, at approximately 10:45 p.m., a group of about 30 people observed a brilliantly lighted aerial object moving across the sky over Monmouth Beach, New Jersey. 

The object, described as being about 75 to 100 feet long, appeared to be shaped like a cigar and was moving at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour. It was witnessed for approximately 4 to 5 minutes before disappearing from sight.

Several of the observers stated that the object emitted a bright white light which seemed to illuminate the surrounding area. Others reported that the object appeared to be surrounded by a reddish glow or aura.

Attempts to identify the object as a conventional aircraft or other known aerial phenomenon were unsuccessful. The description of the object and the speed at which it was traveling do not correspond to any type of man-made or natural aerial vehicle known at that time.
