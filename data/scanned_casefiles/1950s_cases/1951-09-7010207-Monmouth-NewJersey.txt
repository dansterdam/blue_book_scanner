UNCLASSIFIED

Forty-five seconds after the initial sighting, the passenger noted
the object to be turning left in trajectory. The T-33 was apparently
trailing by the same track as the object. At this time the T-33 was
the balloon to easier to determine. as the T-33 continued inland, the line
of sight changed until the balloon was silhouetted against the sky and
being driven higher into the background and was lost. This "clear-clearance"
of balloon is a common occurrence with white tracing research balloons.

I. It is apparent from the above that several examinations had to be made
in order to know that the object was one of the balloons released at Evans
Signal Laboratory, on the east more on a balloon in the near vicinity and
the fact that the pilot and observer were not sure of their exact track adds
a most deal of credence to the assumption. However, since ascertains were
made, it cannot be concluded that the object was definitely a balloon.

II. RADAR SIGHTING FROM PORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY

A. Discussion

All of the radar sightings during this period were made by students
at the Fort Monmouth training center. In addition to this, the students in-
volved were taking a maintenance course. The instructor was a certain
mechanical or electronic officer. No one at the student level could
prove, trouble. If the student became proficient in this phase, he was allowed
to operate the set much the same as an instructor. For example, no-
body, none of any of any type were here. It should be stressed that these
students were maintenance students, not operators.

1. On 10 September 1951 an _______ radar set down in a fast-
flying, low-flying target (exact altitude never found) at approximately
1210 hours position of Fort Monmouth at a range of about 15,000 yards. The
target appeared to approximately follow the coast line channel its range only
slightly cut outside 125 statute rapidly. The radar set was switched to full-
aided search; reading: initial reports of two jet aircraft,
but in this case was too slow to be recorded. The target was lost in the
northwest at a range of about 14,500 yards.

Upon interrogation, it was found that the operator, who had more
experience than the average student, was driving a demonstration for a group
of visitors. He assumed that he was riding in a high-speed aircraft
because of his inability to use _______ which will normally
track an aircraft at speeds up to 700 knots. Since he could not track the target
he assumed its speed to be about 700 mph. However, he also made the statement
that he tracked the object off and on from 117 to 117, or three minutes. Using
this time and the ground track, the speed is on. about 40 mph.

No definite conclusions can be given due to the lack of accurate
data but it is definitely possible that the two to three operator was riding
a demonstration, or a group of visitors, and that the method in a very
unusual radar return, he was in an excited state, not within "per his inability"
to use _______ which would have highly illustrated
in not being able to keep up with the target within the allotted tracking. The
weather on 10 September was not favorable for miraculous observation.

2. On 10 September 1951, 1815 hours, in connection with a tracked a radar which moved slowly in azimuth north of Fort Monmouth at a range of about 3,000 yards at the extremely unusual elevation angle of 1350 mil, (altitude approximately 5,000 ft.). This was never to be a weather balloon. It was tracked by a number of ground observers and an attached officer to determine the altitude in order to establish the weather balloon sighting.

3. On 11 September 1951, 1950 hours, two [illegible] sighted up the same northeast of [illegible] at an elevation of 50 to 200 (10,000 feet). The radar track automatically in azimuth and elevation (altitude 10,000 feet). The rate tracking are capable of tracking targets at a speed of 700 mph. In this case, however, both radar found it impossible to track the target in range due to its speed and the operators had to report to manual range tracking in order to hit the target. This was the second incident in this range tracking.

4. On 11 September 1951, at about 1330, a target was picked up on an air raid sentry aerial mirror. In similar previously identified cases, the target was approximately over Wrightstown, New Jersey, as indicated by its 10,000 yard range, 6,000 feet altitude and north azimuth. The target was practically stationary, so the operators looked out of the war in an attempt to see the target since it was so near. After a short time, however, adverse conditions prevented such observation. The operators noted that when the target was first observed, its elevation at an extra rapid rate, the change in range was so small the operators believed the target must have been nearly vertically. The target was still in elevation at an elevation angle of approximately 1,500 mils at which time it proceeded to move at an extreme; rapid rate in range in a temporarily direction once again the speed of the target increased. No additional tracking of the target was attempted because necessary.

It is finally possible that this is an example of anomalous propagation as the weather was favorable for this type of phenomenon. The students, however, stated that they were aware of this occurrence, however, it is highly possible that this was previous sightings of what they thought to be unusual types of aircraft, they were in the correct psychological condition to see more such objects.

III. CONCLUSIONS

A. The unidentified aircraft reported by the T-33 pilots was probably a balloon launched by the Army Signal Laboratory a few minutes before the T-33 arrived in the area.

B. The 1110 ELST radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was not necessarily a very high-speed aircraft. Its speed was judged only by the operator's inability to use the allied tracking. An this was possible due to the operator being unsure, and not the height of the aircraft.

C. The 1215 ELST radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

D. The 1050 ELST radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

E. The 1930 ELST radar sighting on 11 September 1951 remains unknown but it was very possible that it was due to anomalous propagation in/or the student radar operators' thoughts that there was a great deal of activity or unusual objects in the area.

PORT MONMOUTH, NJ WISELY - 10-11 September 1951

On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of incidents occurred in the area of Fort Monmouth, N.J. An initial sighting of an unidentified object was made on a radar set. Soon after the radar sighting, two Air Force officers in a C-47 aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to intercept an unidentified object. Later aerial radar patrols were recorded.

Status of Investigation

A complete investigation of this incident was carried out and will be reported in Project Grudge Special Report No. 1. It has been tentatively determined that the C-47 pilots probably observed a balloon that had been launched a few minutes prior to their arrival in the area. Two of the radar sightings were returns from balloons and the others were probably due to weather phenomena and excitant conditions. Only one radar return cannot be explained. The operator who observed this incident assured the object was traveling over 700 mph because the radar set's automatic tracking would not follow the target. It is possible that the inability to track the object was due to his inability to properly operate the set under mental stress.

12 September 1951

1. On 10 September 1951 an AN/TPQ-1 radar set picked up a fast moving low flying target (exact altitude undetermined) at approximately 1110 hours northeast of Fort Monmouth at a range of about 12,000 yards. The target appeared to approximately follow the coast line changing its range only slightly but changing its azimuth rapidly. The radar set was tuned to full added azimuth tracking which normally is fast enough to track jet aircraft, but in this case was too slow to be resorted to. The target was lost in the northeast at a range of about 14,000 yards. This target also presented an unusually strong return for an aircraft being comparable in strength to that usually received from a coastal ship. The operator initially identified the target as a ship and then realized that it could not be a ship after he observed its extreme speed.

2. On 10 September 1951, 1515 hours, an SCR 584, serial number 433 tracked a target which moved about slowly in azimuth north of Fort Monmouth at a range of about 32,000 yards at the extremely unusual elevation angle of 1350 mils. (altitude approx. 93,000 ft)

3. On 11 September 1951, 1050 hours, two SCR 584's serial numbers 217 and 315 picked up the same target northeast of Fort Monmouth at an elevation angle of 350 to 300 mils at a range of approximately 30,000 yards. (approximate altitude 31,000 ft). The sets track automatically in azimuth and elevation and with additional range tracking are capable of tracking targets up to a speed of 700 mph. In this case, however, both sets found it impossible to track the target in range due to its speed and the operators had to resort to manual tracking in order to hold the target. The target was tracked in this manner to the maximum tracking range of 32,000 yards. The operators judged the target to be moving at a speed several hundred miles per hour higher than the maximum aided tracking ability of the radar sets. This target provided an extremely strong return echo at times even though it was at maximum range, between the echo signal occasionally fall off to a level below normal return. These changes coincided with maneuvers of the target.

4. On 11 September 1951 at about 1330 a target was picked up on an SCR-584 radar set serial number 315 that displayed unusually. The target was approximately over Navesink, New Jersey as indicated by its 10,000 yard range, 6000 ft altitude and one north azimuth. The target remained practically stationary on the scope and appeared to be hovering. The operators looked out of the van in an attempt to see the target since

it was at such a short range, however overcast conditions prevented much observation. Returning to their operating position the target was changed to be changing its elevation a very rapidly and the change in range was so small the operators believed the target must have risen nearly vertically.

The target ceased tracking at an elevation angle of approximately 1500 mils at which time it proceeded to move at an extremely rapid rate in range in a southerly direction once again the speed of the target exceeding the aid CPS-5A, so that manual tracking became necessary. The radar tracked the target to the max range of 32,000 yards at which time the target was at an elevation angle of 200 mils. The operators did not attempt to judge the speed in excess of the aided tracking rate of 700 mpb.

5. The weather was fair when the observations were made on 10 September and cloudy for the 11 September reports.

DOCUMENT NO. 7010207, ENCLOSURE 1

On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of both visual and radar sightings were reported from the Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, area.

1. VISUAL SIGHTING BY 2ND LT. HAROLD T. T-33 PILOT

a. Discussion

At approximately 1135 EAST an unidentified object was sighted by the pilot of a T-33 aircraft, as Air Force Lieutenant, attached to Signal Air Force Base, New York, from New York. The pilot was flying a T-33 aircraft between 5000 ft. and 6000 ft. at 11 o'clock from the Fort Monmouth area, New Jersey, when the T-33 was apparently over Shrewsbury, New Jersey. The pilot first noticed the object, the unidentified object, a silver-white object, climbing at a 30° angle to the left of his aircraft, climbing the object was in a turn, and the first visual contact was at 1-2 miles distant.

The object was to a turn, climbing at an angle of approximately 30°, and the pilot's first reaction was to turn toward the object. The object was silver in color, climbed with a positive rate, its course was approximately 90° from the T-33's course, and the object's rate of climb was from 45° to 55° and the climb seemed to decrease from 17,000 ft. to 17,500 ft. (see inclosed overlay.)

When first sighted, the object appeared to be darker in color, then, New Jersey. It then turned a white silvery color. The object was round in silver in color but did not reflect a solid outline. At one time a dim light seemed to be of interest, it seemed that the size was 3 x 3 ft. to 5 x 5 ft. in diameter.

At approximately 1112 EAST, 10 September 1951, two balloons were released from the Signal Corps T-33 balloon release point at 71° 04' E. (see inclosed overlay.) These balloons were 7 ft. - 8 ft. in diameter at the time of release and remained in accordance. They were at an average of 500 ft. and were only silver in color. The radar station observed that when viewed from certain radars they appear to be discharged at 1135 EAST. Those balloons would have been at approximately 15, 50 ft., and would have been to a position nearly in line with the radar, New Jersey, at Sandy Hook. (1st SE at 10-15 knots.)

Attempts were made to use the information gained from the interrogation of the T-33 crew and the data on the balloon sighting to prove that the altitude and direction of the T-33 had occurred a balloon. However, not all of the data from the observer will fit a conclusion.

In an attempt to establish the fact that the object was a balloon, a flight with a similar T-33 was given to the crew. (See "Assumed path of T-33" in inclosure.) The T-33 crew was intercepted twice and prove different flight paths and that of the object at that time. It is therefore assumed that the T-33 division are such of the T-33, the fact

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED

IR-3-508
On 10 September, Major [redacted] and Lt. [redacted] of the 118th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, spotted an unidentified object over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Their T-33 was at 20,000 feet, the object was well below, heading southwest. It was first to sight the object (1135 ZN) since Major [redacted] was making a report.

Lt. [redacted] followed the object in a diving turn to the left descending to an altitude of about 16,000 feet with the object about 8,000 feet below and to the east of the aircraft. Thereafter he tried to keep a course paralleling, but above, that of the object.

As soon as Major [redacted] completed his radio track-in he was notified of the strange object. Both watched it make a 90 degree turn to the left and kept it under observation together while it covered approximately 21 miles before it disappeared out to sea. (Refer to statements of pt. [redacted] and map.)

Lt. [redacted] in control of the T-33 had the object in sight for less than a minute. As to the weather and description of the object see attached statements.

On the same date, a radar station at Ft. Monmouth reported two targets that were unidentified, traveling over 700 mph, and giving returns that could not be explained as being ground or aerial target as described in the attached report. However, the possibility exists that the news item reporting the observation by this fighter pilots could have caused the inaccurate or the radar concern to run wild. This is confirmed remote in view of the number of observers witnessing the scope returns and the fact that four such incidents are reported in two days. However, the possibility is being investigated and results will be submitted upon receipt.

21 SEPTEMBER 1951                   10 SEPTEMBER 1951                   EVALUATION B-6

On 10 September, Major [redacted] and Lt. [redacted] were participating in a training flight from Dover AFB, Delaware to Mitchel AFB, New York (Direct), when they spotted an unidentified object over Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

The time was 1135 EDT, and the weather was C.W. When spotted, the object was at an estimated altitude of 9,000 feet. Flying at 20,000 feet, the pilots incredulously made a diving turn in his T-33 and followed and timed the object until it disappeared two minutes later.

Both pilots observed the strange object, which appeared to be the size of an F-86 but much faster (900+ mph), disc-shaped, steady in flight with no visible means of propulsion, and shiny silver in color.

At 1110 EDT a radar station at Ft. Monmouth plotted an unidentified, high speed (above 700 mph) object in approximately the same location.

This headquarters has no information regarding natural phenomena, experimental aircraft or guided missiles that could have caused the observations.

Request USAF evaluation of incident be furnished this headquarters.

Further investigation of sighting report from Ft. Monmouth reveals that although the observing personnel state that they had no information of an unidentified flying object, they were two fighter pilots of this command on 10 September 1951, they were alerted to the possibility of unusual sightings occurring on their radar scope.

The fact remains that one experienced observer was present and saw an object travelling more than 700 mph on 11 September in the New York area.

that error - intent on writing the object, they could not pin point their
rough track. An error was, in part, due to the fact that the pilot was
to accurate a flight track while 5 miles from the given track. Since the
two intersections as to location of the track differ to some extent,
the track record is not a chart index of the actual situation to be
most nearly correct.

Referring to the second flight, as in the enclosed overlay, at A,
the object seemed to be over Jenny Hook. It will be noted that a comparatively small object closer to the a/c would appear to be large if viewed
to be over Jenny Hook. (see figure 1)

At the B-29 forecast the balloon, or balloon wreckage appeared to be traveling at
a high rate of speed. Several recent runs must have been made over the initial
sighting with the pilot deciding that the object was not a conventional a/c
an that he could attempt to identify it. During this period, it is assessed
that the a/c actually ran on course in such a way that the pilot, straight
and level on a reciprocal heading. The fact that the object appeared to be
descending when first sighted cannot be explained. The fact that only one of
the two balloons was seen can be explained by the fact that the observers concentrated on one balloon and did not notice the other one.

1. All personnel listed in initial report from Ft. Monmouth were students, with the exception of one who had been a qualified radar observer during WWII. None of the personnel had any knowledge of a "flying unquown" prior to observation.

2. Item listed in paragraph 2, initial Ft. Monmouth report, was later identified as a balloon.

3. Radar sets at Ft. Monmouth were in first class mechanical condition. However, tests will be conducted during hours that all plots were made on 13 September to check possibility of recurrence of targets and/or explanation for same.

4. At variance with paragraph 1, above, is fact that the Ft. Monmouth F10 called the radar section on the morning of 13 September asking if they had seen anything unusual. A negative reply was received by the F10, but word spread through the ground body that something was going on.

A. Reference to weather effecting radar

The following information was obtained from the weather bureau, Washington, D.C. weather report 10)30, 10 Sept 1951, Washington, D.C.

Southerly winds, a high pushing out off the coast extending for at least 100 miles north and south of Fort Monmouth area. No precipitation for 600 miles in any direction from Fort Monmouth. A few scattered high cirrus clouds at approximately 25,000 ft. No significant inversion below 16,000 ft. An inversion at 16-17,000 ft of 1°/thousand increase. An Air was quite moist up to 14,000 ft - no water droplets. No inversion above 17,000 ft up to tropopause (47,000) Temperature 47,000 was - 67°c a total inversion of 2°c up to 60,000 ft. Temperature decreased from -65 to 75,000 rapidly to -8°c. Didn't get good sounding 2200 EST, however, no significant change occurred - Nothing but intermittent radar signals.

Weather report at Stewart Air Force Base 10:00, 11 September 1951. Indications of an upper front dissipating in the area West of Newburgh. This front carried weak showers which would appear all along the coast (along a line extending from Sandy Hook to La Guardia). There was a very pronounced inversion at 1000 between 2000 and 2500 ft of about 3°/1000 ft increase in temperature.

Within 75 miles of Fort Monmouth at 1000 there were brief showers (small amount of precipitation traces in the order of 100th inch. Water droplets 3-5000 ft. Strata decks at 10-14000 ft. Sounding was ended at 42,000 ft.

In general cumulus clouds with considerable density were encountered. Clouds with water droplets at 10,000 ft at 1000 lowering to 2000 ft at 1600 hrs.

Dr. Herbert S. Bennett, EWC, Fort Monmouth, N.J.
Statement of Dr. Bennett

EWC is interested in countering airborne devices. They are limited in scope of operation to anything that can be countered from a ground installation. Their operations pertain to Army operation.

Major Martin, observer at Twin Lights, heard pilots comments on radio at his station. When Bennett heard via commercial radio that pilots observed an object, he contacted Martin to see if an echo was received on radar scope.

Dr. Bennett stated that EWC (Electronics Warfare Corps) was not operating or performing tests that would cause phenomena as picked up by radar scopes.

Dr. Bennett also stated that he was not aware of other projects that could cause these radar sightings.

When questioned as to date, Dr. Bennett stated that the incident happened the day before he visited Major Martin. The radio report was on the same day that he made his visit to Major Martin who was in charge of a CPS-6B radar installation. When queried as to possible causes of such sightings he suggested several possibilities.

1. Constant altitude balloon. In order to maintain constant altitude during night and day operation (diurnal variants) it is necessary that the balloon drop ballast at night. If for some reason or other, a faulty release prevented dropping of ballast during night, the balloon would float to a low altitude. This would cause the balloon to deflate on the top which would make it look like a saucer shape when looking down on upper surface. The possibility of the pilots looking down on the object just as the faulty mechanism released the ballast would indicate an increase in vertical velocity. This balloon could be either a General Mills or NYU project. It was Dr. Bennett's belief


- page 37 -

that if the balloon was 1000-2000 ft altitude that a PPI scope would not
the balloon having
indicate more than the velocity caused by the horizontal components of wind.

Therefore, it is not expected that any faulty ballast release would result in
high horizontal velocities. His final analysis was that if high horizontal
velocity were indicated on the scope that this would not be the result of a balloon.

Dr. Bennet was queried on signal strength far of a balloon and would it give
signal strength of a B-29 or B-36 at 20,000 yds. He stated that if the balloon
was painted silver as many of them are and it was at an altitude of 5000' or
higher, that signal response would be equal to that of a B-29 or B-35 at 20,000 ft.

His comment was that in general these balloons were used for soundings of between
30,000 and 110,000 ft (extent of Bennet's knowledge). He also stated that sun
could make a balloon look as if it were oscillating.

2. Combined meteorological and oblique incident wave front.

A wave front such as this could give a signal response giving great
apparent speed on a radar scope, even though the actual speed of this wave is
low.

Private

SSN 3952, Fort Monmouth

Duty requires that as a student must learn how to repair, adjust, and operate radar equipment. Started radar course 7 May 1951. Previous experience is that of a radio repair man. Service dates back to Dec 1950. Graduated from radio and television school (Coyne, in Chicago)

Story as given by Private

One Tuesday (not certain of day of date) morning SCR-584A station #315 having a maximum range of 70,000 yds and capable of aided tracking up to 30,000 yds picked up an object, altitude 0-(10-20) miles, azimuth range of aircraft was 20,000 yds and elevation of 800 miles. azimuth 10-15 degrees. Had trouble keeping object on elevation. Object faded intermittently. The time was approximately 10-10:30. Time on scope was 5 minutes maximum. Believed this was a good radar day. Blip looked good - good return. PPI gave good bright spot of approximately 1/3 inch and was well defined. Subject knows about anomalous propagation. Subject stated that Pvt. saw same object that day.

Remarks:

This set will track up to a speed of approximately 700 mph. A plotting board is not normally used in this particular training course. Antenna is usually checked by sighting on Shrewsbury water tower. Prior to sighting instructor nal-adjusted the radar set, thus setting up a problem for the students. It was necessary for to adjust the klystron, receiver, magnetrons. working schedule was 7:30 to 5:30 and leaves area for chow by 11:20. Believes he went off this set on the 14th Sept. Operator believes set was in good working order since commercial aircraft were sighted and tracked prior to sighting of object.

Private Juan . . , SSN 3952, Fort Monmouth

Private was a member of a radar training detachment at Fort Monmouth, N.J. He started this course 7 May 1951 and has been in the service since Dec 1950. His course on the SCR-584 was completed approximately 14 September 1951. His work to date in radar encompassed operational and maintenance procedures on SCR-584, NPG-1 and TPL. Has had previous radio and television training in N.Y.

Has operated and performed all maintenance functions on set No. 315, SCR-584. He is a member in the same crew as Sgt. . . Believes he is capable and knows what a return of an aircraft looks like. The opinion of the interrogator is that he is not too familiar with aircraft designations since he stated that a DC-4 has two engines, however he gives indications that he can distinguish between reciprocating and jet aircraft. He was outside on the van working on the console of another unit when . picked up object. He did not observe . sightings.

He was told by another member of the crew that Allen's observed on his radar set a fast moving object. He observed at 1500 two jets, on his radar scope, azimuth was north of radar set location (azimuth 280°) Elevation was low, just above tree level. Went out of van and visually sighted two jets, silver in color, headed east. Opinion of was that saw a jet. He stated that the radar set was in good working order. He stated that he saw a similar object to that seen by at 800 miles elevation and 23000 yds range, azimuth 335. Could not recall time or date.

Private . Fort Monmouth

Private was a member of a radar training detachment and stationed at Fort Monmouth. His background is that of a student majoring in mathematics at MIT and was to have graduated in the class of 1951.

Story as given by Private

Private stated that Mr. , an instructor, came out to the set he was working on and instructed him to look out for fast moving objects. He called Mr. shortly after and told him he saw a fast travelling object. This observation was taken as a joke at first by Mr. . Private could not remember the date of this observation, except that it was in the morning and it might have been observed on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, possibly 11 or 12 September.

stated that his set was working satisfactorily and that he picked up the object at 5700 miles azimuth and had a good return on the range scope. He put the set into automatic track and noted that the object travelled in an erratic manner. It was always in range and in the N-NE quadrant. The range was about 20,000 yds and never less than 15,000 yds. Always received a strong echo and wasn't bothered with fading. The object was extremely maneuverable.

estimated that the speed was 500 mph. When questioned as to what he knew of anomalous propagation, he indicated that he knew of this phenomenon but believed there was no indication that weather conditions were negative this particular day for such propagation. He also stated that the signal strength was very strong and there was no variation of amplitude. He couldn't say how fast the object was climbing but estimated that the rate of climb was 9000-27000 ft per minute. He stated that he thought the object had high acceleration.


- page 41 -

since the object changed direction or reversed its path in an extremely short time duration. One possible aid to exact date was the fact that some one came in with a newspaper account after the incident.


- page 42 -

Information on How Fort Monmouth Students and Instructors were alerted:

PTO, Pete Hoffman, Fort Monmouth received a call from Mr. Zuckerman, About Press; Hoffman believes the time was approximately 1030 and on a Tuesday. Zuckerman wanted to know if the school picked up any saucers in this area. Hoffman then called Capt Mikulas who alerted Mr. [name illegible], instructor.

Forty-five minutes after the initial sighting, the weather noted the object to be turning left, north, northwest. This can be explained by the fact that the T-33 was turning out the relative motion caused the balloon to appear to be turning. As the T-33 continued, also, the pilot of slightly above 1 mile below the balloon, was able to see the sky and being silver (color) into the background and was lost. This "lean-earance" of balloon is a common occurrence with low altitude tracking missions.

I. It is apparent from the above that several assumptions had to be made in order to show that the object was one of balloons released at Lowry (Van Winkle) Laboratory, with the fact that in balloon it is not readily apparent, and the fact that the pilot and observer were not sure of their exact track while a great deal of credence to the assumption, however, these assumptions were made, it can be concluded that the object was definitely a balloon.

II. DETAILED REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

A. Discussion

All of the radar sightings during this period were made by students at Fort Monmouth Training Center. In addition to this, the students involved were making a maintenance course. The instructor who was making a malfunction report was located at Fort Monmouth and was readily available. If the student's report was sufficient in this case, he was allowed to correct the net much the same as in similar occurrences. No details were given, 10-20 miles of area, just here. It could not be determined whether the sighting was moving, 10-20 September 1951 an A/2C radar set was a fact-finding radar set (exact altitude, meter height) approximately 1110 hours practiced at Fort Monmouth at a range of about 1 1/2 miles. The target appeared to approximately follow a line W. S. W. only slightly off the other. Its exact speed was not calculated against tracking, which not only is far enough to be exact, but in this case was not able to be reported to. The target was lost in the notebook at a range of about 1,000 yards.

From interrogation, it was found that the observer, who had more experience than the average, stated, "We normally become of his inability to use full-scale azimuth tracking which will normally track an aircraft at about 700 mph. However, he also made the statement that to track the object 700 and on 1117 to 1111, or three minutes. Using this time, and the ground track, the speed is about 4 mph.

No definite conclusions can be given due to the lack of accurate data but it is fairly proof. "Last 20-30 feet of arc was driving a demonstration to a group of officers, and that he tracked he was very communal rather than in an exact state, according to his ability to track. He admitted he was having difficulty tracking.

Vacation on 10 September was not favorable for analysis.

1. On 10 September 1951, 1125 hours, at 20-584, serial number 43, tracked a target which moved slowly in azimuth north of Fort Monmouth at a range of about 3,000 yards at the extra low and elevation angle of 2 1/2 mile, (altitude approximately 5,300 ft.). This was proven to be a weather balloon. It was tracked at 26 rounds of the Windham Station JC Set and attachment to determine the altitude in order to establish wind and cell center according with the altitude of a balloon which was sighted right 14.

2. On 11 September 1951, 1150 hours, two SCR 584 radar, serial number 217 and 215, picked up the same target northeast of Fort Monmouth at an elevation altitude 21,000 feet). The sets track automatically 30 yards in (a range of 300 yards) as a target at an altitude 21,000 feet). The sets track automatically in azimuth and elevation and with close range tracking of target to be a good of 700 yards. In this case, however, the Fort Monmouth operators had to track the target in real time to its scope and the operators had to report to manual range tracking in order to hold the target. The target was erratic in the range to 1.5 miles. The operators, however, were able to track the target to be moving at a great several miles per hour. The tracking was difficult due to the electronic signal being occasional. The CWO, however, fell off to a level below normal return. These changes coincided with maneuvers of the target.

This sighting proved to be a weather balloon. How it was determined is unknown but A/C was informed that it was a balloon. A/C later learned on 5 October 1951, that 5 October 1951, which ground visual confirmation was later explained and deduced to ground.

3. On 11 September 1951, at about 1330, a target was picked up on a CPS-5A radar set, serial number 215, that displayed unusual maneuverability. The target was approximately over Kevils, New Jersey; no indication by its 10,000 yard, 6,000 foot altitude, due north, azimuth. The target remained practically stationary on the scope and appeared to be lower. The operators looked out of the van in an attempt to see but target since it was at such a short range, however, of course, conditions prevented observation. Returning to their operation positions the target was observed to be carrying its elevation at an extra rapid rise. The change in range was so small the operators believed this was probably vertically. The target then ceased its rise in elevation at an elevation angle of approximately 3,500 feet. At which time it proceeded to move at an extreme; rapid rate in a southerly direction and in the area of the target, reaction and tracking ability of the SCR 584 so that manual tracking became necessary. The radar tracked its target to the maximum range of 3,500 yards at which the target was at an elevation of 30 yards. The operators, however, continued to judge the speed in excess of the site tracking rate of 700 mph.

It is highly probable that this is an example of anomalous propagation as the weather on 11 September was favorable for this type of occurrence. The students at the time were aware of this phenomenon, however, it is highly probable that they were not certain of what they observed were unusual types of aircraft, they were in the correct psychological orientation to see more such objects.

3 Sept., 1951 30 Sept 51

Following is a verbal transcript of an interrogation of Lt.
First-Interv., Sq. of Dover, Delaware. The interrogation was
accomplished by Lt. Col. M. R. Rosengarten and 1st Lt Jerry
W. Cumming, 115th Field Activities Group, Air Technical Intel
ligence center, Air Technical Intelligence Command.

The subject matter relates to the sighting of an unidentified
aircraft which the subject officers observed on 30 Sept., 1951,
while airborne near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

Although these men had been previously interrogated by [illegible] and [illegible] (Col. Ba Rosengarten of A-2, Newburgh P&Y) the [illegible] was not sufficient
in information which was available from this report to establish the facts of the matter, particularly
in regard to the means whereby the information became available
to the public. This question was of importance, when it became
apparent that the Fort Monmouth radar school received several
telephone calls concerning the incident.

The interrogation follows:

1. The object was first sighted over Sandy Hook, and the
information available to the interrogators was verified as
true and complete by the subjects.

2. The question of communication of the information as examined
as follows:

a. Between 1135 and 1137 on 10 September, 1951, Samworth GCI
(CPS-5) became aware of the existence of a fast flying object when
inadvertently the intrusion communication of the initial sighting
by ? Pilot to Maj. was transmitted over a radio
check-in. It is certain that Samworth heard that there was an
unidentified object making 7-300mph because at this time Samworth
queried "What was that."

At this time Pilot described, giving heading of 1209
and an inadvertently incorrect geographic fix of Seaside Heights
instead of Point Pleasant. It is believed that Lt. Carr was on GCI
and may have acknowledged although this is not certain.

Immediately after locating the object, the T-33 Wegan letting
down to Mitchell, entered the traffic pattern alone, and landed
immediately. The two officers agree on landing time as 1147 EDT.

3. The question of release of communication of this information
was next undertaken in the interrogation. The officers advised
that they had been instructed to release information under certain
circumstances, had refused information sources a tier others, and
that there was only one instance of possible access by persons
who were placed to overhear their conversations, as follows:
a. The driver of a carryall may have heard them say that
they saw a road object at very high speed while he was driving to
then from the ATC to operations on landing. The name of the [illegible]
is not known, nor is it known that he could hear their conversation
over the truck noise.

b. The officers did not render a report of the sighting to
the operations officer at Mitchell, nor did they receive a debriefing
since this was a local flight in Z L.

c. The officers advised Col Sprowls and Col Spain, operations and training officers on General Hinkle's staff that they had seen a very high speed unidentified aircraft and were not advised concerning action. Their only response was laughter. The 1200, approximately, 10 Sept 1951, Mitchell ops took a call for the major. This call, at about 1500 was from a identifying himself as Major Barron, public information officer, who stated that he was a witness to a low, fast, red location, ground track, description, time of sighting, duration of sighting, and color.

Maj Barron allegedly did no qualify himself except as PIO. He then stated that this sounded like good newspaper story material and that he was sending a newspaper man (newspaper name forgotten) over to operations to get the story from Lt. He further said to have advised Lt. Rogers that he was personally clearing this information for release. Maj Barron did not provide a means of identifying or establishing the individual who was to come to see it.

Then Maj Barron asked how long Lt. Rogers could be at Mitchell and was told 4 hours.

About half an hour after the telephone call from Maj Barron, a man in civilian clothes (description not recalled) entered operations and asked the operator, one clerk for Lt. He was at this time looking for the telephone of the base security officer, but failed to find, and did not subsequently report this incident, due to subsequent events.

The civilian introduced himself as a newspaper man, name and affiliation unknown, and that stated that Maj Barron had sent him to get a story. He asked that Lt. see him.

Lt. informed the man that he must call Maj Barron to get a report on his clearance. This the man (failing to locate the PIO office), but succeeding at the officer's mess. The conversation between the civilian and Lt part on the other end of the line was ended, and the civilian informed Lt. it was everything was all right, that he was cleared to receive the information on the authority of Maj Barron.

Lt. took the civilian to the operations map, and showed the geographic location of the sighting, the ground track, the elapsed time, the color, shape. They went from the operations map to a sectional-mounted-map near the weather office for better explanation due to larger scale. The civilian asked Lt. what he thought he had seen, and was told that it was an object which it had never seen before.

Then the civilian asked if it was a flying saucer and again Lt. replied he did not know what it was. Then the civilian asked whether it was a weather balloon, and was told no, that the weather balloons cannot travel so fast as the object sighted.

At this point an unidentified civilian, carrying a 4x5 Speed Graphic, with flash gun and lens and bellows open approached and stated that he wanted a picture of Lt. in front of the operations map. Lt. were working together, but that they exchanged no greetings and names were not used to his recollection. Then

It demurred, saying that it was probably illegal for the civilian to photograph the map. The photographer answered that he had many times taken a picture of people in front of this very map, and a picture was taken. A second picture was taken of Lt and a Captain (by officer), posed at a table with the map. The unknown captain did not wish to have his name used, but consented to pose.

The civilians subsequently left.

Lt. left Mitchell for Dover that evening.

3. On 11-12 Sept 1951, exact date indeterminable at this moment, Maj Gen Lied Maj at Dover from New York, asking for information pertaining to the incident over Saratoga, York, The major replied that he was sorry not to be able to discuss the matter with them, but maintained them to Lt. Payne, the PIO for Clears nee. Lt Payne later reported that he thought the distinguished wire-tap began, and that he refused release, but offered to check on possibility of obtaining release. He called EADP, who called USAF, and the ans now relayed by Payne to Maj was that clearance wasn't forthcoming, and that the matter should be forgotten.

4. Later, a Lt. East at Dover received a call in operations from Associate Press for Maj, who told Lt East to say he was not there.

5. On 17 Maj ordered Maj and Lt. to Newburgh for interrogation.

6. About 20 September, 1949, Robert Johnson of Republic Aviation was called and asked for permission to visit his license the incident they had reported. Maj said that he was happy to have them come over but that he couldn't discuss the matter with them unless they received authority from his to talk over. Johnson called EADP, and EADP advised the Dover base CO. that Robert Johnson and Mr Brewster of Republic were authorized to discuss the incident with Lt. Claus discussion proceeded with ground track, shape, time of sighting, duration of sighting, color, altitude, and heading. The asked specifically concerning a chart, and offered several sketches for identification-none were identifiable. The subjects interrogated the interrogators, learning that Brewster was studying the matter, that USAF and PA personnel would soon arrive to interrogate, and that Brewster thought the objects were electrically propelled. Brewster cited names of people that had reported similar objects previously.

7. Until the interrogation "several more names" were made. There were no further inquiries made of Lt concerning their sighting of 19 Sept 1951.

8. It is perhaps worth mentioning that the additional information received is that the officers have not previously revealed their estimate of some 7-8000 no persons, questioning, except later, and that only during the inadvertant transmission to Samworth was this speed quoted.

9. Previous reports that Lt - had determined that Samworth tracker or whether Samworth got a return on the object in question.

The decision was submitted to USAF Form 2 as follows. It is advisable to make an evaluation of these incidents recommend a full investigation to obtain a complete report of the incident and related circumstances. Evaluations and conclusions should be forwarded to this Hq by teleconference. Immediate investigation will be made. Findings must be related immediately to Hq not later than today, 1 October 1951, following laboratory incidents of concern.

For preliminary analysis to be made immediately for Capt Stewart Air Force base interrogations concerning this incident, a preliminary report was contacted and then written at a late hour in the evening so that Col Boehler was able and Lt Cummings toward a TWA airplane for New York at about 11:30 that night. About 12 o'clock on Saturday morning at Oakhurst and Col Rosenwater reached Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, and contacted 1st Sgt of the Signal Corps station, Ft. Monmouth. Arrangements were made to begin immediate interruption of personnel, conducting electronic sightings through the cooperation of the 1st Signal Corps, with Sgt McArthur.

Capt. Willis H. Sperry, Adj. Asst. Gen. Agent, Akron, Ohio and Capt. and Chiet

Air Force Base were interviewed. Maj. Merlin, Commanding Technical Officer
was also interviewed. Staff Sgt. Wilt, Walter Rote the channel.

It is noted that all individuals were interviewed. Reference to basic GFAS
Memo No. 2 of the release of 28 September 1951 will show the names of
other individuals were concerned with operations of
radar station from which animals were seen on 10 and 11 September. The
significant fact brought out at Fort Monmouth was that the students were operating
their set in a training center that these animals were not connected with
tactical operations. They were also not writing reports and they did not
know how to go any way of their findings. Circumstances were basically
due to lack of experience and technical difficulties in their training. Fact-
ors such as lack of training and lack of technical difficulties were apparent.
The students were charged for detection, the calibration checks were made, and
more aggressive or directive the report on peeling their set to a more
effective utilization, early in their phase of the program associated with
their set. They were entitled to operate the sets much the same as a critical
service for the balance of the period to which they were assigned to a parti-

II. CONCLUSIONS:

A. The unidentified aircraft reported was probably a balloon launched by the Army Signal Laboratory a few minutes before the T-33 arrival in the area.

B. The 1110 ASL radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was not necessarily a very high-speed aircraft. The only high speed noted was possibly due to the ability to maneuver slightly to gain - and this was possibly due to the operator being excited, and not the actual speed of the aircraft.

C. The 1915 ASL radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

D. The 1050 1067 radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

E. The 1336 ASL radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was making random but somewhat predictable patterns that were probably due to ground clutter or other objects in the area.

engaged on their ground being confused by their training program, speaking
specifically of a rapid detail and routine to which they are subjected. This
could be construed to an criticism in that their technical capabilities
seem to be unusually great for students showing that their training courses is
likely a very good one. Notice that paragraph 3 of basic communication includes
two unrelated reports. Pvt and his crew are identified with No. 4, SCR

it is proper to discuss SCR Set Serial No. 315 of Item 3 identifying this was
Pvt and his crew. Pvt , Pvt of this crew were interrogated.
It developed that Pvt was operating the set alone at the time he picked
the signal. He did not relate the information that morning to his fellow
workers, but rather waited until that afternoon. Although they were within
easy hearing distance at the time he identified the target on the scope, the
situation is too confused again in the instance to state specifically any
challenge. It may be concluded however, that radar could have had a definite
effect upon this target as well. Some question may be introduced concerning why
he did not immediately to notify his fellow members of such an unusual
target and he seen it and indeed not mention it during the lunch but wait until
that afternoon later in order to reveal it. It is not to be construed as an
evaluation again. There is not sufficient data to arrive at a conclusion. The
time to be described in paragraph 3 should be approximately 1037 EST. Interroga-

with greater detail dates, time, and circumstances in order to find something
of value. However, it was realized after all this was accomplished, it had
in vain, essentially too much time had slipped for human memory to recover the
total necessary for further evaluation. Thus, the two pilots, Major
wing is clear, and it was flying as pilot of a T-33, signed
an indecisive flying object and they flew into Port Monmouth for investigation.

The story was verified, questioned, analyzed, discussed, and the pilots remained
firmly convinced of the details which they had elicited. However, certain circumstances were indications that they did not possess the detail which they
claimed concerning a track of the flying object they claimed to have seen. They
were interrogated at great length concerning the circumstances whereby this
report concerning the flying object they saw reached the press and also a
request was — — signed for investigation of the base PIO
officer at Mitchell Air Force Base, a Major Barron, in order to clarify his
part in the activity. It is sufficient to state that neither he or
made a voluntary statement to press and that made his statement to the
press only when he was directed to do so by Major Barron, base PIO, and this
is according to statement only. An interrogation of the personnel at
Twin Lights Radar Station was undertaken and it was learned that Twin Lights
was off the air at the time the sightings occurred on 10 September. Visual
and radar sightings are referred to in this instance. Operating hours at
that time at Twin Lights were 0600 to 0800 and 1730 to 2130 NIST. Therefore,
there is no verification from Twin Lights loss of the sighting one way or
the other. However, Staff Sgt Pallock who was monitoring channel fox at the

We checked with Col Kirkland and learned that he wished to leave behind in Washington as short and incomplete a record as possible pending our firm commitment to Washington as a power of major commitment at a later date after we had the opportunity to study the data in detail. This we were successful in accomplishing. We did have the work in Washington on Tuesday morning and afternoon in order to determine the possibility for balloon and experimental aircraft situations as the incident reported. Balloon results were, until after we left Washington, negative as were experimental aircraft possibilities. Agencies contacted with this respect were Con Mills, a Mr. Deloia in Minneapolis, Minn., a Mrs. Madden of the Signal Corps Research Development Center in the Pentagon, Dr. Jack Holloway, and J. Lynd of the Office of Naval Research, Major Vickenna of Mobey Dick Project in the Pentagon, and others incidental in discovering the identity of those project monitors. The weather bureau was contacted for the weather report. Comdl. Post personnel were contacted to determine whether any reports from the Eastern Air Defense Command might have reported any sightings which we did not have. These results were negative. Persons contacted include: Col Mumford, Eastern Air Defense Command, ACSI Officer, at the Pentagon; Col Corey, Command Post Forwarding Officer; L. Col Huber, Command Post Deputy; and personnel in the message centers.

this information which applies possibly in with the airborne sighting.

Paragraph No. 7 (a)   1 relates because:

a.   Constant altitude.

b.   Slow variation in azimuth.

c.   Visual observation about the same time at the same altitude by a group of officers.

d.   Motive as to the cause for search for that balloon was established as an order from the Commanding Officer of the student attachment.

e.   Pip size checks with balloons.

3.   Target echoes as described bear the characteristics which closely resemble aircraft. It is based on what we have now. We can't add anything together. Although it resembles an aircraft, it is not impossible that it is caused by weather phenomena. It is of black waves.

4.   Weather possibility exists as follows:

a.   Stationary target when first detected giving rapid altitude change offers no one solution that fits.

b.   It is to be qualified, however, that weather is not as an explanation of a track of 10,000 yds. continuously at 700/mph over 12,000 yds. range. It is to be mentioned however, that more experienced observations than those of the students would be required to identify any points of similarity in the actual appearance of aircraft, return echoes were able to yield primarily only information concerning the radions.

For exp. However, as next preliminary conclusions offered this staff, the airborne sighting of 1st Lt. and Major follows:

There are some indications that it is an attempt by these two officers to gain publicity in that transmission by the pilot to Sanworth were excited by two lights and it was definitely reported by the monitor that the pilots were excited in describing something which they believed to exist. From the sound of their voices. A ground track was established by reference to interrogation chart made by airborne by Lt. It is believed that the ground chart which he recorded on that map is correct as the pilots consider it. No statement was made as to whether the pilots are correct but only as they consider it. The range involved cross-section by observation from greater altitude against geographic points on the ground. Upper limited range could thereby be established. A size was reported 20 to 50 ft. in diameter is not a fixed or reliable value. It will admit a larger size even up to 8-10 dimensions. As to speed, and would not fix a value. They quote only their ground track against the sighting time that is 30 to 50 nautical miles in about two minutes. This shape oblate spherical the color silver. There were no more observations which we could offer the staff. At the time of this recording, conclusions are something as follows: From the interrogation of it, the T-33 pilot, (a) the subject was circular in shape changing after banking to elliptical. Conclusion: Oblique spheric in shape the object bank in turning. (b) The object was silver in color. Pilot was firm that the object did not reflect the sunlight brightly. (c) The object covered 35 to 50 miles during a two minute period of observation. Conclusion: that with an allowance for misinterpretation, the object makes good speed greater than 150/mph. (d) The object cannot be fixed for size except within the lower

round of 35 ft diameter and upper bound of 3-17 diameter. (c) The time of sighting was 11:35 EDST and the object was lost at 11:57 EST, on 10 September 1951. However, all the foregoing observations concerning the conclusions from the interrogation of Lt are in the assumption that it is impossible to demonstrate this criteria necessary to establish their sighting as one of a balloon. Now these criteria are considered to be something like the following:

a. Opportunity - that is the presence of a balloon in that geographic area.

b. Similarity - that is points of similarity between balloons and observations made.

c. Absence of a negative component - that is, the pilots themselves verified as a balloon or the subjects who were viewing from the ground did not see a balloon or did see a balloon. However, this could be elaborated upon. It is believed that essentially that these factors would affect the decision.

Now as to opportunity, we have information that the Evans Signal Laboratory released two balloons at 11:12 EDST 10 September, that these balloons were in the air until 12:02 EDST 10 September and that they burst at 104,000 ft and the diameter of the balloons at burst were 39 ft approximately. It is to be noticed that Evans Signal Laboratory is located at Belmar, N. J. It is considered that opportunity is presented in the time element and in geographic locations regarding points of similarity the following must be considered:

Considering that the pilots disagreed radically, interrogations of A-2 of the CAMS and interrogation by ATIC personnel as in their written statements concerning points that they are not sure or more than this fact that the

object was always on their left and that they did not or did assume a parallel
heading. Mathematically speaking, this is to say that the object was going in
the same direction as the T-33 aircraft was turning; and that the object is following
a course such that it is always leading the aircraft, that is, out of phase with
it, or that the object is traveling in phase inside the circle of the aircraft
and indeed that if any even be stationary inside the circle of the aircraft.

It is to be noted that the interpretation that the object always lay on the left
of the pilot may be that the object was a balloon stationary inside their turning
circle. It is also to be noted that the pilots are not sufficiently sure of
the ground track to negate this and a calculation concerning what the altitude
of a balloon mast or are unnecessary and impossible in that the accuracy of the
pilot's report is an extremely questionable thing. In fact, there is indication
that they cannot fix the alleged ground track of the object within 10 nautical
miles. Note that in terms of speed, this means ten nautical miles in two minutes
or five nautical miles per minute or 300 knots per hour if one takes the extreme
error between the two observations of ground track. A point of similarity is
that balloons are silvery painted for radar purposes when released from Signal
Laboratory. So recon was reported by the pilot. A point of similarity
is the shape viewed under proper circumstances that the balloon might have an
unique experimental shape. In the light of this information, it is considered
that there is strong possibility that the sighting was that of a balloon. However,
if it can be disproven without recourse to metaphysics that the object was not
a balloon then it should be considered that the four conclusions previously
viewed are essentially those which we can stand firmly upon.

Statement of Sgt. [redacted] 4TH ACSN

At about 0415, 1 October 1951, my infant son woke me up wanting to come to my bedroom. When he came down to my room there was a very bright light right outside my window which is on the East side of the house. I live about three-quarters of a mile North West of Webster, Texas. The object seemed to be stationary. When I first saw it at about 110° from my window and about one-half a mile away at 4000 to 5000 altitude.

I did not go back to sleep and observed the object until about 0700 at which time it disappeared by rising almost vertically. The time it began rising was about 0630. During the time of observation the object moved up and down like a yoyo about a half dozen times. The range of the object was approximately 100 feet.

One time (about 45 minutes to 1 hour after I first sighted the object) it went north at a very high rate of speed similar to rate of movement of a homing bird. It was approximately 1 mile north then returned to same relative position at a lower altitude.

The light was so bright that I was unable to see any shape or form, but the object seemed to be sending out constant rays of light similar to a diamond glittering. There was no smoke nor sparks as if a fire was burning. There was no sound. The light was about 12 inches across and total size including rays, was about 3 or 4 feet, in diameter, although the rays cause the shape to appear to vary. I was first observing the object through a window screen, but at about 0520 I went outside my home and observed the object for about 20 minutes.

At 0430 I spoke to my neighbors to use their telephone. I phoned the base to get someone to come see the object. The Base Telephone Operator gave me OA's number, but phone was answered by the Base C.Q. who said CQ was not available. I told the person for my call and he suggested I call Base Operations then Red by call through local Operations. A Sgt. answered the telephone at Base Operations and said A.C. was not available. I told the Sgt. what I was seeing and he said the only words will I can recall is that "Wright Patterson is experiencing with a project which involves calling it."

Witnesses other than myself were my wife, Mrs. [redacted] and my neighbor, Mrs. [redacted].

COMMENTS of Reporting Officer:

1. Informant is NCOIC of Security for his section. He is 27 years old, an Intelligence appearing person who doesn't appear to be highly excitable. His story was told in a calm, straightforward manner. He is a rated civilian pilot (license No. [redacted], rated commercial pilot, Ratings - Airplane Single & Multi-Engine land, Flight Instructor - Airplane).

2. A further check with M/Sgt. [redacted] on duty at Base Operations revealed a Pfc. [redacted] was called the Base. An information copy of Sgt. [redacted] statement was given to S/[redacted], local O.S.I. Detachment, who asked that Pfc. [redacted] not be contacted regarding his statement about the Wright-Patterson experiment that involves Ellington Air Force Base until his (OSI) office gets an answer to a check they are making.

3. A check of the Air Almanac showed Venus to have been in at about the same compass position of the object seen by Informant at the time covered by this report.
