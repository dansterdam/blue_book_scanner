Dear Dr. Olivier:

This is in acknowledge receipt of your postcard dated 1 February 1953 reporting a bright meteor that was observed on 23 January 1953 at 22:30 EST.

For your information, the Air Technical Intelligence Center received a report of this meteor from this office at 1:55 on 24 January 1953. It was observed on a bearing of 270 degrees which corresponds to a direction from his position.

It is realized that this data are vague but it may be of some use to you. 

Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

Yours very truly,

ROBERT C. BROWN
Maj. USF
Aar Adj. Gen.
