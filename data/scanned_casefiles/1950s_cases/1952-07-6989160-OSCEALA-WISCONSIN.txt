AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From (Agency): 637th AGB Sq, Osceola, Wis.    Report No. 3-52    Page 1 of 2 Pages

1. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS: Numerous unidentified flying objects of undetermined size or shape were sighted by ground electronic means in the early morning of 29 July 1952 by members of the 637th AGB Sq, Osceola, Wisconsin, who were on duty. These objects were sighted while watching the sighting were normal with the exception of one (1) large well defined target. (Reference is made to Incl A). This report is based on this target was 600 knots as computed on the radar scope and in the fifty (50) nautical mile range. The remainder of the sightings were individual sightings having multiple targets, up to ten (10), appearing in a loose cluster on the radar scope. (Reference is made to Incl 12, the report). Speed of these targets was sixty (60) to sixty (60) knots as computed on the radar scope set on the fifty (50) nautical mile range. The only possible location noted during the entire sighting period was during one (1) or two (2) of these targets which seemed or actually were moving in a loose formation. All targets eventually appeared on the radar scope and after being traveled some thirty (30) and one-half (30 1/2) nautical miles would just as suddenly disappear. Targets did not appear on the height indicators due to numerous phenomena. Targets followed a general pattern of appearing on the scope, remaining stationary, then suddenly disappearing. There was a continual overlapping of patterns on the radar scope, a new pattern would have appeared before the old pattern would have disappeared. In the declining period of multiple targets, a reference is made to Incl 2, this report. With the exception of possible formation movement (no applicable indications), targets progressed across the radar scope, until disappearing, independent of each other in regard to tracks and bearing.

Correlation is made with visual sightings made by a pilot of the 107th Interceptor Sq. Pilot sighted multiple targets in the area. Correlation was made with the 637th AGB Sq. visual sighting. This correlation substantiates the possibility of unidentified flying objects at time of sighting.

Sightings occurred between 2901300 and 2902203 lasting approximately 1 hour.

3. PARTICIPANTS OF SIGHTINGS: Sightings covered by this report were made by ground personnel and pilots. Type of equipment: AFB-68; Frequency—272528 to 3005MCs; TWO—600WTS; Antenna tilt—For sighting in which target was well defined (Reference is made to Incl A, this report) antenna tilt was nine (9) degrees. For other sightings (Reference is made to Incl #2, this report) antenna tilt was five (5) degrees. All motor readings were normal and equipment was functioning properly.

4. LOCATION: Location of sighting station is 45/15-92/38/5.4N. Targets would appear on the radar scope in a general area twenty (20) to thirty (30) nautical miles southeast of sighting station. All sighting stations were traveling southeast would disappear from the radar scope in a general area thirty (30) nautical miles southeast of sighting station. (Reference is made to Incl #1 & #2, this report).

CASE NO. 7
29 July 1952

Osceola, Wisconsin

Numerous unidentified flying objects of undetermined size or shape were sighted by ground electronic means between 0130B and 0230B (lasting 1 hour) on 29 July 1952 by members of a radar unit located near Osceola, Wisconsin, who were on duty. Size of the blips which constituted the sightings were normal with the exception of one large well-defined target, speed of this target was 600 knots as computed on the radar scope set on the fifty nautical mile range. The remainder of the sightings were individual sightings having multiple targets, up to ten, appearing in a loose cluster on the radar scope, speed of these targets was fifty to sixty knots as computed on the radar scope set on the fifty nautical mile range.

The only possible formation noted during the entire sighting period was during one or two of the sightings which consisted of multiple targets when two or three of these targets might possibly have been moving in a loose formation. All targets suddenly appeared on the radar scope and after having traveled between thirty and seventy nautical miles would just as suddenly disappear. Targets did not appear on the height indicator due to anomalous propagation. Targets followed a general pattern of appearing on the radar scope at the sighting station and proceeding S until disappearing. There was a continual overlapping of patterns on the radar scope; a new pattern would have appeared before the old pattern would have disappeared.

In the sightings which consisted of multiple targets, with the exception of possible formation movement, targets progressed across the radar scope, until disappearing, independently of each other in regard to track and heading with some targets making a turning course. There was some correlation between these electronic sightings and visual sightings made by a pilot who was scrambled in conjunction with the radar sightings. This correlation placed both types of sightings in the same area at the same time. Pilot estimated point of objects he visually saw at 125,000'. Sighting station was specifically searching for possible unidentifiable flying objects at time.

25 Jul 1952, Osceola, Wisconsin

Targets on photos marked Enclosure Point PZ are considered to be due to interference from another radar set operating very near the frequency. Preliminary investigation at this station and antenna rotation appear to show that:

Indications are that this radar set located in South-Eastern direction two Osceola, IL is considered possible that one W/O (Weather Observation) Westover at Altoona, Wisconsin could have caused interference.

The periodic appearance of the target, was caused by the radar, and the difference in rotation could have occurred when the two antennas were positioned to each other.

Flights on photos marked Enclosure Point PZ cannot be so accurately evaluated in those particular cases. However, the general area is consistent, possibly some weather phenomenon may have caused the signals.

Weather data would be useful in determining if or what distance (200 miles) radar set could have caused the interference. In this period are:

a. Temperature vs height
b. Visibility vs height
c. Cloud height

CASE NO (contd)
of first sighting due to a GGC report of visual sighting of unidentified flying objects.

One F-91 aircraft was sent to sighting area for purpose of intercepting and/or
identifying unknown target. While-a/c-course pilot did report visually sighting
unidentified flying object but interception and/or identification was not possible.

This action occurred between 0130 and 0330.

One F-91 aircraft was in an area 50 to 70 nautical miles S and SSE
45/138-92/38-5.W between the altitude of 6,000 to 10,000' during the sighting period.

ATIC Comments:
Report indicates that anomalous propagation was affecting the radar performance.

This condition would allow detection of ground targets which are not normally detected.
This would not explain movement of targets unless weather conditions were such that
every target (ground) was not detected in each sweep of the antenna thereby causing
an apparent movement of stationary targets.

A firm analysis cannot be made.

Conclusion:
Unknown

At 0700, 29 July 1952, we the undersigned, began to make test on our radar scope that date of trip to Cities Service. We had the following personnel: Capt. Wm. Nash, Capt. Wm. Pierson, and myself. This incident began to take form when we were flying in the direction of St. Paul and south of the city at 5,000 ft. altitude. We first noticed a formation of 4 objects flying in a tight formation. These objects did not track or the same heading. Some were making turns. The way of chase was climbing to 12,000 ft. We made several attempts to gain information among ourselves. We were not able to get a clear picture.

No further than a limit of 2 or 3 minutes had elapsed when the pilot observed what appeared to be shooting toward the target sighted. On several possible Army vectors toward the target sighted. Here was an Army, target, and the pilot observed several area east of St. Paul and south of the city at 12,000 ft. altitude. Believed to be approximately 125,010 ft.

1. In the reports referred to, it is believed that no connection actually exists between the visual and radar sightings; therefore, they would fall in the same category as many other simultaneous reports.

2. Paragraph 2 of the radar summary could logically be expanded with the following statement: The large amount of ground clutter on the radar indicator is created with weather and humidity conditions, weather conditions. Targets reported on photos marked "Inclosure 1" most likely are different individual stationary ground targets. The signal amplitude of ground targets that are detected can be compared and/or analyzed. Layers may only paint occasionally or at a random rate. When several individual targets are painting in this radar manner, it is quite easy to assume that a particular stationary target has moved from one location to another, resulting in apparent speed variations from zero to several thousand miles per hour.

3. There is no new data that will allow a more complete analysis.

Report indicates that anomalous propagation was affecting the radar performance. This condition would alter detection of ground targets which are not normally detected. This would not explain movement of targets unless weather conditions were such that every target (ground) was not detected on each sweep of the antenna - thereby causing an apparent movement of stationary targets.

A firm analysis cannot be made.

Weather data: Temperature vs height, and moisture lapse vs height would be of some assistance in analysis.

676TH AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING, Osceola, Wisconsin

AFFIDAVIT

7 August 1952

At 0730Z, 29 July 1952, no the undersigned, began to notice targets on our Radar Scope just east of the Twin Cities. We had tilted the Antenna to 5° just prior to this because of a GCC report of an unusual object. The targets which we noted on the scopes were traveling in a southeast direction at from 30 to 50 knots. After traveling about 30 miles in this manner they would fade. There were up to 10 of these on the scopes at one time. At times it would appear like a loose formation was being flown by two or three 12 these. The targets continued to appear around the area about 5 to 15 miles east to northeast of the Twin Cities for an hour. These targets did not fly in the same track or the same heading. Some were making turns. The antenna tilt was 5° on these sightings to eliminate anonymous propagation on the scopes and pick up the targets.

One large target appeared at 185° at a range of 19 miles. In less than a minute it was at 165° at 21 miles. It continued in this manner for about 70 miles and faded. In this time we had the antenna tilted to 9°. This target was moving east, traveling over 600 MPH and made a continuous track. It was a clearly defined blip. No weather of any kind was in the area. We were not receiving any electronic interference.

In A/C was scrambled because of these sightings. The interceptor pilot observed what appeared to be several ships or something with balls on several occasions when vectored toward the targets which were on our scopes. There were so many targets that we had the pilot patrol the general area east of St. Paul and north of the site of the 676th ACEW Squadron. The pilot observed one or two of these objects while doing this. He was at 25,000 feet and thought the things he saw were at 125,000 feet.
