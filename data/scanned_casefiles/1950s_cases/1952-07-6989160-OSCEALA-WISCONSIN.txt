APPROVED 1 June 194

From: (Av..... 
674th AC& W Sq), Osceola, Wis. Rep ort No. 3-52 

D. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS: Numerous unidentified flying objects of undefined size or shape were sighted by ground sight means in the early morning of 29 July 1952 by members of the 674th AC& Search Sq., Osceola, Wisconsin, who were on duty. Size of the blips which constituted the sightings were normal with the exception of one (1) Large well defined target (Reference is made to Incl #1, this report), speed of this target was 500 knots as computed on the radar scope set on the fifty (50) nautical mile range. The remainder of the sightings were individual sightings having multiple targets, up to ten (10), appearing in loose similar areas on the radar scope ( Reference is made to Incl #2, this report), speed of these targets was fifty (50) to sixty (60) knots as computed on the radar scope set on the fifty (50) nautical mile range. The only possible formation noted during the entire sightings period was during one of two (2) of the sightings which consisted of multiple targets where two (2) or three (3) of these targets sight possibly have been moving in a loose formation. All targets suddenly appeared on the radar scope and after having travelled between thirty (30) and seventy (70) nautical miles would suddenly disappear. Targets did not \(appear on the height indicators due to enormous propagation. Targets followed a general pattern of appearing one behind the previous target of the sighting station and proceeding easterly until a new pattern would appear before the old patter would have disappeared. In the sightings which consisted of multiple targets (Reference is made to Incl #2, his report) With the exception of possible formation movement (no applirable indicators) targets progressed across the radar scope, until disappearing, independently of each other in regard to track and heading with some targets making a long course. There was some correlation between these electronic Signings and visual sightings made by a pilot of the 109th Flnt-Jet Intercepter Sq., Minneapolis Field, Minneapolis, Minn., who was scrambled by the 674th ACAW Sq. Scramble in conjunction with the radar sightings. This correlation occurred both on the sightings in the same area at the same time. Pilot estimated height of objects he visually saw at 25.000 feet. Sightings station personnel were responsible fur possible unidentified flying objects at this station, Report is made dux to a Ground Observer Corps report of visual sighting of unidentified flying objects.

E. TIME OF SIGHTINGS: Sightings occurred between 290135 and 292036 lasting

|| c. MANNER OF SIGHTINGS: Sightings covered by this report were Made by ground electronic equipment. Type of equipment—an/CPS-6B, Frequency—27B3/t5 0  3005mc/s; 1700—600FPS. Antenna title—For sighting in which targets would do tined blip (Reference is made to Incl #1, this report) stenna tilt was nine (9) degress, For/sither sightings(Reference ia made to incl #2, this report) antenna tilt was five (5) degrees. All motor rendering were normal and equipment was amctiotong, properly. 

LOCATION: Location of sighting station is 45/15N—92/3/5.... lburgets would appear on the radar scope In A general area twenty (29) to thirty (30) nautical miles southwest to south of sighting static and sipther w travelling southeast would disappear from the radar scope in a general area thirty (30) nautical miles southeast of sighting station(Reference is made to Incl #2, this report).

CASE __7___

29 July 1952						Osceola, Wisconsin

			Numerous unidentified flying objects of undetermined size or shape were sighted by
ground electronic means between 0130S and 0230S (lasting 1 hour) on 29 July 1952 by
members of a radar unit located near Osceola, Wisconsin, who were on duty. Size of the
blips which constituted the sightings were normal with the exception of one large well-
defined target, speed of this target was 600 knots as computed on the radar scope set
on the fifty nautical mile range. The remainder of the sightings were individual sight-
ings having multiple targets, up to ten, appearing in a loose cluster on the radar scope,
speed of these targets was fifty to sixty knots as computed on the radar scope set on
the fifty nautical mile range. The only possible formation noted during the entire
sighting period was during one or two of the sightings which consisted of multiple
targets when two or three of these targets might possibly have been moving in a loose
formation. All targets suddenly appeared on the radar scope and after having traveled
between thirty and seventy nautical miles would just as suddenly disappear. Targets
did not appear on the height indicator due to anomalous propagation. Targets followed
a general pattern of appearing on the radar scope SW of the sighting station and pro-
ceeding E until disappearing. There was a continual overlapping of patterns on the
radar scope; a new pattern would have appeared before the old pattern would have
disappeared. In the sightings which consisted of multiple targets, with the exception of
possible formation movement, targets progressed across the radar scope, until disappear-
ing, independently of each other in regard to track and heading with some targets making
a turning course. There was some correlation between these electronic sightings and
visual sightings made by a pilot who was scrambled in conjunction with the radar
sightings. This correlation placed both types of sightings in the same area at the
same time. Pilot estimated height of objects he visually saw at 12,500’. Sighting 
station was specifically searching for possible unidentifiable flying objects at time

The provided image contains a photograph of what appears to be a radar screen image. The image shows a circular grid with various radial lines and a dark area in the central region that looks like a radar echo or signal. Below the circular grid, there are several devices including a rectangular box, what seems to be a control or monitoring device, and a round dial with numbers possibly indicating some measurement or time.

Now, here is the extracted text from the document using OCR (optical character recognition):

```plaintext
25 July 1952, Osceola, Wisconsin

Targets on photo marked “Hudson Point fm" are considered to be due to interference from another radar set operating somewhere in the same frequency pulse repetition rate and antenna rotation speed as the set at Osceola. Indications are that this interfering radar is located in a South-east direction from Osceola. It is considered possible that the W/T set located at Allouez, Wisconsin could have caused interference due to the W/T set located near Osceola.

The periodic appearance of the targets was caused by the slight difference in rotation speed of the two radars antennas. Interference occurred when the two antennae were pointing towards each other.

Targets on photo marked “Hudson Point fr" cannot be as accurately evaluated. Indications are, however, that this photo was taken about the same time as the other one. It is considered possible that the two too may have been caused by interference from the interfering radar signals.

Weather data would be useful in determining if some distant (2000 plus miles) radar sets could have caused the interference, the data needed are as follows:

a. Temperature and winds
b. Humidity at peak height
c. Cloud conditions

CASE # (contd)
of first sighting due to a SOC report of visual sightings of unidentified flying objects.

One P-51 aircraft was sent to sighting area for purpose of intercepting and/or
identifying unknown targets. The--e ,--  /ee-ere Pilot did report visually sighting
unidentified flying object but interception and/or identification was not possible.
This action occurred between 0138C and 02580. 

One P-51 aircraft was in an area 50 to 70 nautical me me miles S and SSE of
N'/31-92/38-5 ,,4Z between the altitudes of 6,000 to 10,000' during the sighting period.

ATIC Comment:
Reports indicate that anomalous propagation was affecting the radar performance.
This condition would allow detection of ground targets which are not normally detected.
This would not explain movement of targets unless weather conditions were such that
every target (ground) was not detected in each sweep of the antenna thereby causing
an apparent movement of stationary targets.

A firm analysis cannot be made.

Conclusions:

Unknown

AT 0703Z, 29 July 1952, the undersigned began to run stacks
with scope radarscope signals thicker than in cities. We had six
sill statbuff, five B-29's, lots of small track and no report of air- 
craft. Then things began to go up. We noticed a large group of strange 
radar reflections forming into groups of 10 objects per group moving
from west to east at approximately 200 miles. It would appear to go too
close on the American continent sometimes waiting at a cough like a dog. 
Sometimes these group objects would stop and would be replaced by 
others, but altogether they composed six groups appearing on repeated 
track of the same signals. Some were making turns and banks while 
others hold the air while others were bobbing up waiting on signal 
scopes and had come to the rest. 

A 727h,large formation of lights passing over radar signals 
more than a luminous object which appeared against the moon luminous shadowing.
corner of radar we made an exact and exact spotting to return awaiting for 
more spots but there were none then and awaiting over 600 yards they moved 
off radar without a track, thus leading to meditation. Signals were clear
and although conditions were hot, dewiness did not appear great quietness in
reflection though ace.

At 768Z, JJ's employed approach of eight, lights were observed by me and 
pilot. Observed many, appeared to be shooting lights were comprehended well, 
on several occasions when vectored toward the target. Much heat were on 
screen. There were so many targets in air that the plainness of their
material were not noted. All had sightings heading radar 678 and held many 
hundreds of yards. Observed surfacing and appeared to bear VVL or A/CU.

FROM: Air Technical Intelligence Center 

1. In the reports referred to, it is believed that no connection actually exists between the visual and radar sightings; therefore, they would fall in the same category as many other simultaneous reports.
2. Paragraph 3 of the radar summary could logically be expanded with the following statements:’- The large amount of ground clutter on the radar indicator is consistent with anomalous (temperature and humidity conditions) weather conditions. Aircraft reported on photos marked ‘Incloure 1’ most likely are different individual stationary ground targets. The signal amplitude of ground targets that are detected due to temperature inversion and/or moisture lapse may only paint occasionally or at a random rate. When several individual targets are painting in this random manner, it is quite easy to assume that a particular stationary target has moved from one location to another, resulting in apparent speed variations from zero to several thousand miles per hour.
3. There is no new data that will allow a more complete analysis.

A F F I D Av I T

At 07002, 29 July 1952, we the undersigned, began to notice car-
gets on our Radar Scopes Just east of the Twin Cities, we had tilted
the antenna to 50' Just prior to this because of a CCC report of an 
unusual object. The targets which we noted on the scopes were travel-
ing In a southeast direction at from 50 to 60 knots. After traveling
about 30 miles in this manner they would fade. There were__up to 10 of 
these on the scopes at one time. At times it would appear like a loose 
fonnation was being flown by two or three of these. The targets con-
tinued to appear around the area about 5 to IE miles east to northeast
of the Twin Cities for an hour. These targets did not fly in the same 
track or the same heading. Some were making turns. The antenna tilt 
was 50' on these sightings to eliminate anonymous propagation on the 
scopes and did pick up the targets.

ulne large target appeared at 185° at a range of 1? miles. In less 
than a minute it was at 165' at 21 miles. It continued in this manner 
for about 70 miles and faded. At this time we had the antenna tilted 
to 90". This target was moving east, traveling over 600 MPH and in the same 
continuous track. It was a clearly defined blip. No weather of anc
kind was in the area, we were not receiving any electronic Interference.

In a/C was scrambled because of these sightings. The interceptor 
pilot observed what appeared to be shooting stars or comet with, tails 
on several occasions when vectored toward the targets which were on our 
scopes. There were so many targets that we had the pilot patrol the 
general area east of St. Paul and south of the site of the 674th AC&W 
Squadron, The pilot observed one or two of these objects while doing 
thin. He was at 25,000 feet and thought the things he saw were at 
125,000 feet.

ENCLOSURE #3, REPORT 3-52
Observers Signed Narrative of Sightings

674th AC&W Sq,
Osceola, Wisc.
45/9/31-92/38/5:4W

NARRATIVE

    I first observed the identified flying object at about l6llE CDT on l3 July 52 while on duty as a Tracker at this AC&W site near Osceola, Wisc. I was on break when Airman Malarski who was on duty as a directed me see the object. He ask aid in identifying it, questioning whether an intense white light near Coura. We checked all flight plans and found that there were no flight at the altitude this object appeared to above beaker, to be about 10-15,000 feet.

    The object seemed to be heading northwesterly and when first observed appeared to be like spherical aircraft within the attitude margin. The object dimmed somewhat in brilliance, and as it passed near our position and moved to the northwest, the hot low intensity, bright white light continued to fade, the lights were all norma No further remarks of it were heard from my position.

    In matic tracking I left this object being tracked because I was unsatisfied with my observations and therefore cannot answer any queries pertinent to this sighting. I do know that the object was very far behind anything I have ever observed before. It was definitely a smooth flying, non-powered elliptical aircraft. I immediately returned to my position after the object was of sight but was unable to continue tracking it because no radar contact had been received on it.

    I am not sure that this object was a weather balloon or similar object because the balloon I am speaking of was at too low to the horizon for a balloon, also the object appeared to be much larger than a weather balloon, having a size comparable to a C-47. The object may have actually been at 40,000 ft. me appeared well in the horizon, but I am not

    At the time of the sighting, visibility was good. If was clear and no clouds. and the Moon was visible at the time, although not in the immediate area of the object. The sighting lasted approximately twelve minutes, that was above the crafts

   At about 1623 approx. I observed the object for the last time. Id
