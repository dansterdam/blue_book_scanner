AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Country: USA
UFO: 
Location: Georgia (NE Volta)
Date: 14 MAY 1957
File No: 
Preliminary Evaluation: 

Several sections of the document are blacked out/redacted, making some text illegible. The document appears to be an official Air Force intelligence report with multiple signature lines at the bottom. The page number "21" is visible in the top right corner. The bottom of the document contains a standard disclaimer text, but it is too blurry to read completely.

The document is a black and white scanned page with varying degrees of image quality, with some areas darker and less clear than others.

UNCLASSIFIED

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most of the text is difficult to read clearly due to the image quality, but the document appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report from Rome, Georgia. Some sections are blacked out or obscured. The header indicates it is an unclassified document with a specific form number (112-MAT 11). The date and other specific details are not clearly legible.]

The text in the body of the document is largely illegible due to poor image quality and faded/blurry text. While some words and phrases can be partially made out, I cannot confidently reproduce the full text without risking inaccuracy.

At the bottom of the document, "UNCLASSIFIED" is visible again.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most of the text is partially illegible due to the poor scan quality, but some parts are readable:]

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

[Locations partially visible:]
a. Dobbins Air Force Base, Marietta, Georgia
b. Dobson AFB, [rest illegible]
c. Chatta[...] Airport, Tenn
d. Marietta Naval Air Station, Tenn
e. [Some other locations partially obscured]

[Some paragraphs are partially readable but too blurry to confidently transcribe entire text]

At the bottom of the document, there appears to be a standard disclaimer text, but it is mostly illegible.

There is also a handwritten number at the bottom right of the document.

A small dark object (possibly a UFO or artifact) is visible on the right side of the document.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most of the text in the body of the document is too illegible to read clearly. There appears to be a signature at the bottom right that looks like "Richard F. Horner".]

At the bottom of the document, under "Comments of Approving Officer", there is a partially legible line that reads: "Concur in the opinion of the Examining Officer that explanation was caused by a flight of conventional type aircraft as contained in this report."

The document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom of the page.

The document appears to be on an official Air Force form (AF Form 112 - Part II, as noted at the top left).


- page 5 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

[Typed document text, partially legible]
Received (date to date April 6, 1955) from Hq USAF, Washington, D.C. Msg dtd 4 Apr 55, Subj: UFO Sighting, 11th Mailing the UFO...
[Rest of text in the central block is partially illegible]

At the bottom of the page:
Rockford, Illinois

The text in the central block is mostly obscured and difficult to read completely. Some words are visible but not enough to confidently transcribe the full text.

Nuclear Test Today
LAS VEGAS, Nev., April 5 (R)
—Atomic scientists changed
their minds today and rescheduled for 9 a. m. tomorrow the
highest nuclear test made in the
United States. An earlier announcement said there would be
no test tomorrow because of unfavorable weather. However, a
later re-evaluation apparently
indicated improving wind conditions aloft. The shot, designed to
be a weapon or test, is to be
touched off six miles above
the proving ground at Yucca
Flat.
