AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: AERIAL PHENOMENA INVESTIGATION,
ROME, GEORGIA, 12 APRIL 1955
DETAILED REPORT:
ON 12 APRIL 1955, AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 HOURS, A BRIGHT LIGHT WAS OBSERVED IN THE SKY APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES NORTH OF ROME, GEORGIA. THIS BRIGHT LIGHT WAS FIRST OBSERVED HOVERING IN THE NORTHERN SKY FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES, AFTER WHICH IT MOVED RAPIDLY UPWARDS AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS ROUND IN SHAPE AND APPEARED TO BE EMITTING A PULSATING OR FLASHING LIGHT. NO NOISE WAS HEARD COMING FROM THE OBJECT. THIS INCIDENT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, MOST OF WHOM WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROME AIR FORCE DEPOT.
INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:
SINCE ONLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROME AIR FORCE DEPOT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM OTHER INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS. THE OBJECT OBSERVED COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT OR ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA. ACCORDINGLY, THIS INCIDENT REMAINS UNEXPLAINED.

IT CAME INTO VIEW IN THE SOUTH AND MOVED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE NORTHEAST. IT APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN COLOR AND REFLECTING SUNLIGHT. NO SOUND WAS HEARD. ESTIMATED SPEED WAS ABOUT 500 KNOTS.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report document with a text excerpt about a "Nuclear Test Today" scheduled for April 5, 1955 by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The text discusses the details of the upcoming nuclear test, including that it would be observed and evaluated, and that the test shot was planned to be touched off six miles above the plateau.

Nuclear Test Today
LAS VEGAS, Nev., April 5 (AP) - The United States Atomic Energy Commission announced today that it plans to conduct a nuclear test tomorrow, the first of a series scheduled. The test shot is an earlier shot than previously announced, the announcement said, there would be no further test tomorrow because of unfavorable weather. However, a later evaluation apparently indicated conditions suitable for the test, which was to be touched off six miles above the plateau at Yucca Flat.
