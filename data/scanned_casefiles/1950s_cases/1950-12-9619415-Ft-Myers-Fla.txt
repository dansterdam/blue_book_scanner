"Saucer' Reported 
Over Ft. Myers 
According to the report, a military witness sighted a large "flying saucer" with glowing areas on its leading edge yesterday over Ft. Myers, Florida. The witness, U.S. airplane purchasing agent during World War II, spotted the object at 2:00 p.m. while on his way to Punta Gorda. He stated that the object was traveling about 500 feet and that it appeared to be round or elliptical in shape, with a metallic glowing edge or boundary and a moving part that was orange-red in color. The witness claimed he could detect no means of propulsion, and the object disappeared to the North-west at a great speed, faster than any airplane.
