'Saucer' Reported
Over Ft. Myers

Ft. Myers, Dec. 7. A 75-foot silver flying saucer with welded seams and four jets hovered over the North side here yesterday for seven minutes according to Harry Lamp, U. S. airplane purchasing agent during World War II.

Lamp said he and four boys, one his son, spotted the craft at 1 p.m. at 8,000 feet and that he viewed it through 7x50 binoculars. He said it was 14 feet thick at the middle and three feet at the edges with a revolving center extending to within four feet of the edge. The boundary of the moving part was orange and the rim red. On the edge were four jets, two white and two orange.

Lamp said he could detect no occupants in what appeared to be a bubble on top. He said the disc hovered for a time and then disappeared to the Northwest at a speed "faster than any airplane."
