(7) Weather and Winds Aloft Conditions at time and place of sighting:

(a) Observer stated weather was clear and cold and visibility was very good.

(b) Weather Detachment reports show wind direction and velocity as follows: At ground level weather was clear with 1.5 mile visibility with wind from north at 2 knots and temperature at 22 degrees. Wind direction and velocity was shown as:

6000 as 38 knots at 320 degrees. 9000 as 52 knots at 310 degrees 16000 Nothing available 20000    "        " 30000    "        " 35000    "        " 50000    "        " 80000    "        " 

(c) Ceiling was unlimited.

(d) Visibility was 15 miles. 

(e) No clouds.

(f) None.

(9) None. Incident not reported for 13 hours.

(10) Appeared to be over barracks area of Little Rock AFB travelling in southeasterly direction. Only altitude estimate was that it was "extremely high up.” Does not recall seeing or hearing any planes in the area at the time and the unidentified object did not make any audible noise.

(11) Observations of the observer by the investigating officer indicated that he is a Negro, 44 years of age, who appeared conservative in his reporting of the incident and stated he hesitated to report it lest he be considered ready for a psychiatric analysis. His estimate of the size of the unidentified object is the only point when investigating officer felt observer was in doubt and although comparison was made of a star or a quarter or a dollar, he still persisted that it was about the length of a B-47 though traveling much too fast for any plane. The observer stressed that he saw no object but that the lights indicated a continuous bright white light followed immediately at the rear by a red light but this did not appear as a tail stream.

TOICO1, Hq 825th AD. Subj: Flying Object Little Hock Air Force Base

Observer stated he had just come from the barracks and was waiting for a bus to take him into town He stated he had had nothing to drink at the time, but did have something to drink later when he got into town. He worked Sunday afternoon and called OSI when he got to work at 1330 hours.

(12) No physical evidence was obtained

2. Investigating Officer interviewed Major Joseph C. Gamble, Commander, Detachment 13, 26th Weather Squadron. AWS, Little Rock AFB to obtain weather information. Major Gamble when told of the reason for this interview, stated he had been driving from his base quarters to the OMB shortly after 1900 hours, 13 December 1953, when his wife called his attention to a rapidly moving bright yellow light with a red trailing which seemed to be traveling above the base at a very rapid speed and which seemed to go out of plane still over the base He was driving along the street from the officers residence quarters which runs in an easterly direction and the light appeared to be traveling towards the earth in a southeasterly direction. However, he believed it was a large meteorite, the largest he had ever seen, and gave the matter no further thought. He stated it did not have the appearance of a cigar-shaped light, but was more like a flare. Attached is a drawing of the scene of the Incident showing the location of the observer and Major Gamble.

3. Major Gamble showed the writer a disposition form sent to Berkdale AFB, 26th Weather Squadron in reference to a report of an unidentified flying object seen over Little Rock AFB on the night of 13 December 1953 by weather observer A/1C Charles A. Scales who was also seen by the tower 11 weather observer on duty at 2351 G. 13 December 1953, sighted an unidentified object or light on approx. mate bearing of 105 degrees, first visible about 5 degrees above horizon, falling straight down. It appeared as a light of yellow and red coloring, and appeared to explode in flame. Observer thought it mas vary close to station (LRAD). A check made with the Memphis and Nashville Control Tower revealed the sightings of a similar object to the east and northeast, respectively. I do not know in any checks were made further to the east or not. It appeared to be a meteorite but this report is forwarded for whatever value it is. (Signed Joseph C. Gamble, Major USAF, Commander, Detachment 13,26th Weather Equadron; A/1C Charles A. Scales was off duty until 13 December 1953.)

4. Major Gamble further reported that A/2C William R Bindlay, the control operator in the tower had also observed the same light as seen by Scales. While talking with Major Gamble, A/IC E M Babon, AF 14526556, assigned to weather detachnent 13, overheard part of the conversation and stated he had seen an unusually bright light about

YOCOOL, 1q 825th AD, Subj: F'lying Objects Little Rock Air Force Bese

the size of a B-47 about 1900 houra 1!3 December 1953, while driving
on Highway 67 east from North LitUe Rock, Arkansas with A/C George
Taban, A!' l•!217009, he saw a bright light flash across the sky which
appeared to be over the Little Rock AFB (approximately 7 miles away)
which appeared to travel horizontally to the ground for about 30°
and then exploded like a fireworks rocket. A/C Taban stated
when his attention was called to the light by A/C patent he only
saw it for about 2 or 3 seconds before it appeared to explode. The
light appeared to be about a foot long and narrow and was white in
color. He also thought it went parallel to the ground in a straight
line. The night was clear and the visibility was very good. It did
not appear to be a meteor of which he had seen four on the night' of
13 December.
        5. A/1C F. William R. Dad.ley Was interviewed and stated he was in
the tower as an observer on the night of 1!3 December 1958 when he
happened to see a bright red light to the east which he first thought
wae a flare, but it was moving very f'aet and got brighter as it trarnled
but finally went out. It wa;i about 7 to 5 degrees above the horizon
when he first noticed it and only moved about 2 degrees towards the
horizon during the 2 seconds it waa visible to him.. He called the
Air Police and was told they had not sent up a flair. Thereafter; he
received a call f'rom Adams Field inquiring if he had seen a bright
light in the sky. He was told that observers at Adams Field had seen
it to the east. !Ie described the light as about the size of' a quarter
if placed up against the glass in the 'Gower. He finally concluded
that it was Sputnik III descending into the atmosphere since he had
seen news items that it was about to tal.ll..
     6. H:r. J. J. Casper, Special Agent in Charge, ~Soltte Rock Field
Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Post Otrice, Little Rock,
Aricu:i:ee, w!vised on interview that his of'f'ice had not received any
information on any unidentified flying objects on 5, 13 or 14 December
1958.
     7. Major Loge, Detachment 8, 10th IBS Squadron, Adams Reeld,
Little Rock, Arkansas, was contacted by the investigating officer and
advieed that he had no report of any unidentified flying objects being
picked up recently by his personnel.
     a. Nr. Williams, Tower Operator, Adams Field, above, had no
report of any unidenti!'.ied flying objects on either· 13 or 14 December
1958.
     9. Since the incident of S'ighting a UFO on 1# December 1953
ended in the apparent disintegration ot' the object, no details on
weather conditions are 'being subaitted for tha.t date.

h. Observer first contacted the Combat Defense Force at Little Rock Air Force Base on the chance that the object or light might have been a flare released in the vicinity of the base. A check was then made with Adams Field Control Tower, Little Rock, who also saw it to the east of them.
