(7) Weather and Winds Aloft Conditions at the end

Place of sighting:

(a) Observer stated rather was clear and good and visibility was very good.

(b) Weather Detachment reports snow wind direction and velocity as follows: At ground level winds were near 15 miles visibility with wind from north at 2 knots and temperature at 28 degrees.

Thin altitude as follows:
6000 as 38 knots at 320 degrees
12000 as 52 knots at 310 degrees
16000 Nothing available.
20000 Nothing available.

(f) None.

(8) See below.

(9) None. Incident not reported for 18 hours.

(10) Appeared to be over barracks area of Little Rock AFB traveling in southeasterly direction. Only altitude estimate was that it was "extremely high up." Does not recall seeing or hearing any planes in the area at the time and the unidentified object did not make any audible noise.

(11) Observations of the observer by the investigating officer indicated that he is a Negro, 44 years of age, no apparent conservative in his reporting of the incident and stated he hesitated to report it lost he might be considered ready for a psychiatric analysis. His estimate of the size of the unidentified object is the only point of investigative interest. Comparison was made of a star or a quarter or a dime, and although that it was about the length of a 3-47 though traveling much too fast for any plane. The observer expressed that he was very sorry that the lights indicated a continuous bright white light followed immediately at the rear by a red light but did not appear as a tail stream.

Observer stated he had just come from the barracks and was using for a bus to take him into town. He stated he had been nothing to drink at the time, but did have something to drink later when he got into town. He worked "midday afternoon" and called off work at 1330 hours.

(12) No physical evidence was obtained

2. Investigating officer interviewed Major Joseph G. Gamble, Commander, 308th Weather Squadron, MATS, Little Rock AFB to obtain weather information. Major Gamble stated he had been driving from his base quarters to the CANO shortly after 1900 hours, 13 December 1958, when his wife called his attention to a rapidly moving bright yellow light with a red fringe which appeared to be traveling in a southwesterly direction. He was a very rapid speed and which seemed to go out while still over the base and gave the base a long chase through the base perimeter which runs in an easterly direction and the light appeared to be traveling forward in a southwesterly direction. However, he believed it was a large meteroid, the length he had ever seen, and gave the matter no further thought.

3. Major Gamble showed the writer a disposition form sent in to Barksdale AFB, 26th Weather Squadron in reference to a report of an unidentified flying object near Little Rock AFB on the night of 5 December 1958 by weather observer A/2C Charles A. Scalaro, which was on file by same at 2351 C, 5 December 1958, showing an unidentified object on light on approximate bearing of 205 degrees, first visible at 5 degrees above horizon, falling, straight down. It appeared as a bright, yellow, red ball of light, and appeared to resemble a clear. Observer thought it was very close to ground (LOWER). A check made through the Memphis and Nashville Control Tower revealed the sighting of a similar object to the east and northeast. I do not know if any checks were made further to the east or not. It appeared to be a separate incident. (Signed Joseph G. Gamble, Major USAF, Commander, Detachment 12, (Signed Squadron; A/2C Charles A. Scalaro was off duty with 18 December 1958.))

4. Major Gamble further reported that after William R. Dudley, the control operator in the tower, had also seen the same light as seen by Scalaro. While talking with Major Gamble, A/2C Dudley, AT 1156265, assigned to Memphis Detachment, explained part of the conversation and stated he had seen an unusually bright light about

the size of a B-47 about 1300 hours 14 December 1958, while driving on Highway 57 east from north Little Rock, Arkansas with A/C Mazzeo, A/C 11471000. To an A/B light aircraft about 7 miles away, he appeared to be over the Little Rock AFB (approximately 7 miles away) which appeared to be a ball horizontally to the ground. For about 30 seconds and then explode like a fireworks rocket.

was an attention was called to the light for about 2 or 3 seconds before it appeared to be about a ball color. He also thought it went parallel to the ground and was white in line. The night was clear and the visibility was very good. It did not appear to be a meteor or which he had seen before on this night.

5. A/C William R. Dudley was interviewed and stated he was in the tower at an observer on the night of 13 December 1958 when he happened to see a bright red light to the east which he first thought was a flare, but it was moving. Very fast and got brighter as it moved but finally went out. It was about 4 to 5 degrees above the horizon during the 2 seconds it was visible to him. He called the Air Police and was told they had not sent up a flare. Thereafter, he made a call to the Adams Field inquiry if he had seen a bright light to the sky. He was told that observers at Adams Field had seen it to the east. He described the light as about the size of a quarter placed up against the glass in the tower. He finally concluded that it was a bright UFR ascending into the atmosphere since he had seen news items that it was about to fall.

6. Mr. J. J. Casper, Special Agent in Charge, Little Rock Field Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Post Office, Little Rock, Arkansas, advised on interview that he had no detailed information on any unidentified flying objects on 5, 13 or 14 December 1958.

7. Major Loge, Detachment 3, 10th SRS Squadron, Adams Field, Little Rock, Arkansas, was contacted by the investigating officer and advised that he had no report of any unidentified flying objects being picked up recently by his personnel.

8. Mr. Williams, Tower Operator, Adams Field, above, had no report of any unidentified flying objects on either 13 or 14 December 1958.

9. Since the incident of sighting a UFO on 14 December 1958 ended in the apparent disintegration of the object, no details on weather conditions are being submitted for that date.

LEGEND OF SYMBOLS (partially visible on right side of document)

The document appears to be a map or diagram with various lines and geographical markings. The text is handwritten at the top of the document, and there is a legend of symbols on the right side, though most of it is not clearly legible.


- page 7 -

The image appears to be a topographical map or site plan, likely of Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. The document is a black and white image with contour lines, buildings, and what seems to be terrain features. In the top left corner, there is some handwritten text that appears to say "BASE HOLLY" but is partially illegible. The map shows various structures, what look like runways or roads, and detailed terrain elevation lines. The image quality is somewhat grainy and aged, typical of mid-20th century documentation.


- page 8 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

"BASE ELEV"

The rest of the document appears to be a topographical or terrain map with various lines, contours, and geometric shapes, but the text is largely illegible or too faint to read with certainty.

I apologize, but I cannot clearly read any text on this document. The image appears to be a technical diagram or map with topographical lines, some geometric shapes, and what seems to be a grid or layout, but the text is too blurry or faint to make out any specific words or numbers.

This appears to be a technical diagram or map, likely of Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. The image is a black and white schematic showing various buildings, structures, roads, and terrain features. Some text is visible but mostly illegible due to the low contrast and image quality. The word "COMMUNICATIONS" can be partially made out near the bottom of the diagram. The map shows a clustered area of buildings and structures in the center, with surrounding terrain and what seem to be roads or pathways.

26TH WEAPON, 24WSD13, 9 Jan 59, Subj: UFO

h. Observer first contacted the Combat Defense Force at Little Rock Air Force Base on the chance that the object or light might have been a flare released in the vicinity of the base. A check was then made with Adams Field Central Tower, Little Rock, who also saw it to the east of them. Adams Field personnel checked with Memphis Tower, who had seen it to their base, and it was found that Nashville Tower had seen it to their northeast. No known further identification checks were made.

1. None.
