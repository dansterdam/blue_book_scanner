"Hq PACD, MATS, Hickam AFB, T.H. TR-665-52 2 2

Source: Mr. ____ civilian employee at Pearl Harbor Navy Yard, T. H.

1. On 29 September 1952 at 2105 hours local time, Mr. ____ ____, a resident of Civilian Housing Area #3, observed an "object" in the sky which he believed to be a strange and unusual "flying object."

2. Mr. ____ phoned the report of the alleged object to Hickam AFB, Operations Tower. The report was made to CINCPAC and received by the 14th Naval District Intelligence Section and Hawaiian Sea Frontier. Further debriefing of Mr. Roach was accomplished by Major Rowe, 1500th Air Base Wing Intelligence Officer.

3. Upon interrogation, Mr. ____ stated that he had observed a black circular shaped object, about four feet in diameter, moving in a straight course at a speed comparable to that of a jet fighter (estimated by Mr. ____ at about 300-400 miles per hour) over Hickam AFB in a westerly direction and heading towards the ocean. The "object" was observed for a period of 2-3 seconds before its disappearance.

4. Mr. ____ stated there were no accompanying sounds, lights, trails, exhausts, vapors or unusual maneuvers. He was unable to determine the method of propulsion or recognize any conventional aerodynamical features of the "object." The "object" was first noted at the base of a white cloud which appeared close to the ocean and was black and circular in shape. Mr. ____ did not see any aircraft flying at the time of sighting but observed at least one aircraft flying over the area where the object was sighted about 5-10 minutes later.

5. The cloud layer at 2105 hours on 29 September 1952 was at 3000 feet; overcast was broken (cumulus sky) with 5/10 to 7/10 coverage.

6. Major Rowe called Hickam AFB Operations for additional information and was informed there were no local aircraft in the vicinity at the time the "object" was sighted.

7. No other reports of a sighted object was received from any aircraft, military or civilian personnel. The area of the alleged sighting is within Hickam AFB and the adjacent areas are heavily populated.

8. Mr. ____ , a civilian employee at Pearl Harbor Naval Yard and has had some experience in observing conventional flying aircraft. He stated that his vision is normal.

COMMENTS BY PREPARING OFFICER:

Although the source was sincere in reporting what he interpreted to be a "flying object", no credence is placed in the report by this officer. It is dark at 2000 hours in this area and the "object" as viewed at that time of the day and at that distance could not definitely be verified.
