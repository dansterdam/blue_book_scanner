UNCLASSIFIED

10 June 1953                                                 Detroit, Michigan

Description

At 2310 EST on 10 June 1953 an AFROTC cadet at Wayne University observed one large bright object that was white or light yellow in color, round in shape and large than a star. This object moved from a high westerly position in a falling arc toward the north and then leveled off and proceeded at a high rate of speed to the north in a straight line. This object made these maneuvers in a period of 60 seconds and disappeared over the northern horizon. The object, though bright, cast no beam nor left any trail or exhaust. No sound was noticed.

Discussion

Movements of this object and length of observation eliminate the possibility that it was of astronomical origin. Checks with airports in the vicinity revealed that there was one aircraft in the area. This was a DC-4 enroute to Chicago on a heading of 270 deg and was probably not in the area. A check was made with the weather bureau to determine whether or not they had a balloon in the area. A balloon could not be released at 0300Z, but it could not be sighted since it burst before 0410Z (time of sighting).

Conclusion

Unsolved

Dear Lt. Olsson,

Now that Jennie has her preliminary clearance, she can help me handle the reports and can type the letters to you and to your successor. This will improve the quality of the typing (1) I am sure. I cannot guarantee spelling. (Neither can I.)

With respect to the two wires you sent us on June 23, there is only one thing to say: The 21 June report, AFB case must be tossed out because of grossly insufficient data. Do you think there is a glimmer of anything interesting there which would justify sending a Form A7 to seem to make reports of this kind just clutter up the wires without accomplishing anything.

The San Antonio 16 June is clearly a meteorological phenomenon and one that would warm the heart of Menzel. This was undoubtedly as suggested, namely the light of the setting sun on a high cloud.

Referring to the follow-up statement on the 10 June Detroit case, both Jennie and I still think this was a landing light and agree it could not have been a meteor.

Business is a little slow. Jen is going ahead with requesting cooperation from the air control tower operators. Her usefulness has increased in view of her temporary clearance and I hope that her full clearance will not be too long in coming.

I hope we can see you soon and wish you a bon voyage into law School.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Information Copy                                     12 June 1953

SUBJECT: FLYING OBJECT

TO:   Director of Intelligence
       Headquarters USAF
       Washington 25, D.C.

THROUGH: CHANNEL:

1. In compliance with the provisions of AFL 200-5 dated 29 April 1952 the following report is submitted as a result of information reported to this headquarters by AFROTC and other units:

a. Cadet Alvey reported seeing one large bright object, white or light yellow, round in shape and larger than a star, move from a high to a lower position in a falling arc toward the north, then level and proceed at high speed in a straight line north, disappearing over the horizon. First visual observation was on 10 June 1953 near Dearborn. No sound was heard to indicate method of propulsion. The cadet was unable to reliably estimate speed or distance of the object since he did not know the size thereof. He indicated that the object appeared to fall free for a short time then level off and increase speed in level flight.

b. The time of sighting was approximately 2310 eastern standard and 10 June 1953 and the estimated time in view was one minute.

c. This was a visual observation with no optical or electronic equipment available.

d. The location of the observer was approximately 35 degrees 14 minutes west and 42 degrees 25 minutes north. Specifically, the cadet was on the northwest corner of the intersection of Redford Avenue and Grand River Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. The object was sighted and position to the west of the observer and disappeared northward. Distance and altitude could not be estimated.

e. Cadet Robert E. Alvey is an AFROTC Cadet in his third year of training. He is physically qualified for and has planned for several years to enter pilot training. His interest in flying makes him observant of all visible flying aircraft. It is believed that this is a report of something he could not relate to his past observations, experience or his knowledge.

f. The weather at the time of sighting was clear, visibility was generally 10 miles or better and wind aloft were from approximately 700 degrees varying with altitude between 10 and 62 knots.

g. The only known traffic during the time of the sighting was one commercial plane enroute from Chicago to Willow Run Airport in Detroit.

STATEMENT

Wednesday
10 June 1953

Reference were sent to you week

I had just left the Redford Theater and was cutting across a parking lot at the northwest corner of Grand River and Redford Avenue. I was admiring how clear the sky was and how well the stars shone when I spotted this object. At first I thought it was a meteor, but as I didn't make a long to prove wasn't, a meteor just don't act like this object did. When I first sighted the object, it was northwest of me. It appeared to be about five times the size of a large star and just white in color. The light was white as light yellow and of constant intensity. It did not flicker like stars do. The time was within a few minutes of 2310 hours.

The object also fell too slow to be a meteor. I would judge the speed to be somewhat under 1000 m.p.h. The object was clear and distinct and round or elliptical in shape. It seemed to fall free at first, but then it changed course, leveled out and headed due north. I would judge for almost a minute before it disappeared over the horizon. The sky was perfectly clear and the air cool, sound would have traveled good, but there was none except the few cars on Grand River a block away.

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson;

Of the last batch of 11 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is any question is the 12 June Covington, Georgia. It is essential to know here the duration of sighting. A lot depends on this. Can you get this for us?

Regarding the Detroit 11 June "case" is there anything in this that a good landing light would not explain? Likewise Googe AFB 11 June it would appear that drive second radar did not pick up the signal, the most probable explanation is faulty radar. I assume that the GCI had radar available.

And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.
Anything new on!
    5 March    Shaw AFB
    3 March    Luke AFB - Film?
    17 Feb.    Port Austin
    25 March   San Antonio
    12 April   Stead AFB

I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's clearance so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything about this but just mentioning it anyway. I hope it comes through before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
[Signature]
