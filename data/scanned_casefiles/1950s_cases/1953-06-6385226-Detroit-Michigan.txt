Apparently an unidentified object was observed. The brief summary and analysis indicate that the object was observed for 60 seconds, described as bright, round and glowing, and traveling in a northwest direction at high speed. The witness could not identify the object.

10 June 1953
Description
At 2310 EST on 10 June 1953 an AFROTIC cadet at Wayne University observed one large bright object that was white or light yellow in color, round in shape and larger than a star. This object moved from a high westerly position in a climbing arc toward the north and then leveled off. This object made these maneuvers in a period of 60 seconds and disappeared over the northern horizon. The object, though bright, cast no beam nor left any trail or exhaust. No sound was noticed.
Discussion
Movements of this object and length of observation eliminate the possibility that it was of astronomical origin. Checks with airports in the vicinity revealed that there was no aircraft in the area. This was a DC-4 enroute to Chicago on a heading of 270 deg and was probably not in the area. The object was only seen for a short time and the weather balloon was determined to be eliminated 0800Z but it could not have caused the sighting since it burst before 0002Z.
Conclusion
Unsolved

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY

COLUMBUS 10

8 July 1953

Lt. Robert Olsson
AFIT - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson,

Mrs. Janet Jennie has her Preliminary clearance, she can help me handle the reports and can type the letters to you and to your successor. This will improve the quality of the typing. (I am sure I cannot guarantee spelling. (Neither can I.)

With reference to the 21 June case you sent us on June 23, there is only one thing to say: The 21 June report to APB case must be tossed out because of possibly inaccuracies there. Do you think there is a chance of anything interesting there which would justify sending a Form AI? It seems to me that reports of this kind just clutter up the wires without accomplishing anything. 

The San Antonio 16 June is clearly a meteorological phenomenon and one that would warm the heart of "sensi." This was undoubtedly as suggested, namely the siting of this setting sun on a high cloud.

Referring to the follow-up statement on the 10 June Detroit case, both reports and I still think this was a landing light and agree it could not have been a meteor. 

Business is a little slow, Jan is going ahead with requesting cooperation from the air control tower operators. Her difficulties have increased in view of this contact and I hope that her full clearance will not be too long in coming.

I hope we can see you soon and wish you a bon voyage into Law School.

Sincerely,
Allen Hynek

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT AFROPT Cadet Robert L. Mathews, 31-235, US Air Force
PLACE OF OCCURRENCE Detroit, Michigan
DATE OF OCCURRENCE 31 June 1953
DETAILS: On the evening of 11 June 1953, AFROPT Cadet Robert L. Mathews was proceeding from Chicago, Illinois to Detroit, Michigan on Capital Airlines Flight 200-5. As the flight was over Lake Michigan, approximately 30 miles east of Detroit, at approximately 9:40 PM EST., the pilot observed a bright light in the sky. The light was stationary and had a reddish-orange color. The pilot reported it to the co-pilot and both observed the light for several minutes. The light then began to move in an erratic pattern, moving rapidly first to the right, then to the left, up and down. After approximately 15 minutes, the light accelerated and moved out of sight at a high rate of speed. The pilot reported the incident to the Detroit Control Tower upon landing at Wayne Major Airport, Detroit, Michigan.

The observed sighting lasted approximately 25-30 minutes. It was a visual observation with no optical or electronic equipment. The location of the observer was approximately 32 degrees 5 minutes north latitude, 82 degrees 50 minutes west longitude, on Grand River Blvd. in Detroit, Michigan. The object was observed at an altitude estimated to be approximately 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and was traveling at a speed estimated to be approximately 600 to 700 miles per hour.

The time of sighting was approximately 10:50 pm Eastern Standard Time. The only known traffic during the time of the sighting was one commercial air-liner, which appeared to be flying in a normal manner.

STATEMENT

Wednesday
10 June 1953

At approximately 10:15 PM EST on the above date, a parking lot at the northwest corner of Grand River and Woodward in Detroit, Michigan, was the location of an extremely unusual celestial phenomenon.

A parking lot attendant reported that he was refueling his car when he noticed a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be about five or six times the size of a normal star, and it was hovering or stationary. But it didn't take so long to realize that it wasn't a star - it was this object that first caught his attention.

The object also seemed to be a meteor. It appeared to be about five or six times the size of a normal star and was a bright whitish or light blue color, brighter than a star. The light was steady, not flickering like stars do.

This time was within a few minutes of 2310 hours.

The object also fell too slow to be a meteor. It would judge the object to be a meteorite under 1000 m.p.h. The object remained stationary and did not move for several minutes before it disappeared over the horizon. The sky was perfectly clear and the air cool, but there was none except the few cars on Grand River a block away.

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Of the last batch of 4 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is any question is the 12 June Covington, Georgia - it is essential to make the distinction of sighting. A lot depends on this (can you get this for us?)

Regarding the Detroit 11 June case is there anything in this that a good landing light would not explain? Likewise Godge AFB 10 June - it would appear that when tracked on the signal-did-not-tick-up-the-audion-and-lost-probable explanation.

And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.
Anything new on:
5 March Shaw AFB
5 March (also AFB) - Film?
27 Feb San Antonio
12 April Stead AFB

I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's clearance so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything about this but just mentioning it anyway. I hope it comes through before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
Allen Hynek
