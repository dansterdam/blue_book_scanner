objects flying in formation.

2. DETAILS. This office is in receipt of letter dated 21

District, San Diego, California, signed by [name redacted] and written in
connection with AF Letter No. 200-3, dated 20 April 1952, above letter
advised that two U. S. Navy pilots while cruising over El Cajon, California,
on a southerly head (nautilus area of Prose Field facilities) sighted ten
unidentified objects in the same area on an easterly head.

5. The weather was clear with ceiling and visibility unlimited with little or no wind. There was no meteorological condition which would account for sighting. Observation was impossible due to greater speed of objects. There was other air traffic in the general area at Brown Field, however, there were no reports from them.

6. ACTION: No action will be taken by this District. A copy of this report is being made available to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.
