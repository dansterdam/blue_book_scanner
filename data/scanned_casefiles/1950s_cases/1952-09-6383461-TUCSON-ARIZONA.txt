SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object at Little Rock, Arkansas

TO:   Director of Special Investigations
       Headquarters United States Air Force
       Washington 25, D. C.

1. SYNOPSIS: Mrs. [redacted], Little Rock, Arkansas, who at approximately 1000 hours on 18 September 1952, she took a photograph of an unidentified flying object which appeared in the sky, south of her home, at the address listed.

2. DETAILS: Mrs. [redacted] residence as shown, who is employed by the U. S. Tire Corporation, Adams Field, Little Rock, Arkansas, reported to the 11th District Office of Special Investigations Detachment Commander, Little Rock, Arkansas, on 29 September 1952, that she was stopping from her front door, facing south, at the approximate area of her front yard when she observed an object in the sky. She had in her possession a No. 616 Kodak camera and took a photograph of an object which was estimated to be an altitude of approximately four miles, above the size of a dislogue, and about three stories from the ground.

Mrs. [redacted] described the object as being bright silver and dark in the middle and appeared to be spinning in one direction, then appeared to reverse itself and fade away. The length of this object was dim with little or no wind and the only object between her and the flying article was a small wooded area which is shown in the enclosed photograph.

The original photograph has been forwarded at this District and are the inclosures, the original having been returned to her request.

5. The information was informally reported to the Sunday Ghibli, an English language newspaper published weekly in Tripoli, Libya. The information was carelessly and incompletely recorded and the published article lacked many essential details. The editor of the Sunday Ghibli admitted freely to printing the article for its "interest" value.

The witness of this flying object was Mr. [redacted], Reliability unconfirmed.

6. Weather - Clear; visibility 15 miles - surface winds 130°, 4 knots.

2. Time - approximately 2030 Local. Observed for approximately six to seven seconds.

3. Visual observation at various locations in the city of Tripoli, Libya.

4. Traveling, in general, on a North-South line and then disappearing vertically. Sighted approximately ten miles North over the Mediterranean Sea at high altitude (not estimated). There were contradictory reports on its movement - both northerly and southerly directions being given.

10. No other air traffic.

9. Both copies of these two Sunday Ghibli articles are copied herewith verbatim:

FLYING SAUCER SEEN OVER GARIAN GEBEL

Third Libyan appearance reported

Another "Flying Saucer" has been seen over Libya. This is the third reported appearance of the phenomena in Libya which when the "Saucers" have appeared in other countries have puzzled scientists and military experts alike.

First reported three years ago by an American serviceman at Wheelus Field who said that he saw a disc high in the sky over the airfield, and later said to have been seen over the Cyrenaica gebel by a party of Englishmen returning to Senai after a day in the mountains, the latest appearance was last Friday night at Garian.

The story comes from Mr. Joseph Mallia of 21, Via Livorno, Tripoli, who was sitting with four friends in the Government tobacco monopoly building in Garian when the object was first noticed. It was described as almost vertically to an enormous height.

"We were sitting on the balcony of the building", said Mr. Mallia to the Ghibli, "when from the southeast, flying at a height of some ten thousand metres, we saw a circular light approaching. It had a tail of about twenty metres long and this was also illuminated."

We never that it could not have been an aerospace as it flew without a sound. At first it was acting slowly toward us and we had it in view at 11:20 PM. We all saw it quite plainly. Suddenly, after we had been watching it for some minutes, it stopped moving horizontally and shot upward to a complete vertical position. It disappeared off the top atmosphere.

"It could not have been a comet because these fly out of the earth's orbit. Other facts so straight and clear - like its display of the beam, that it was apparently stationary for a while, etc. - all point to something else."

Confirming three facts the next witnesses were a Welshman and his wife walking
in the Giardini Idris. They had arrived at the turning by the Cafe della Post which
gives a view over the sea and were startled to see a brilliant ball of light flash
across the opening. They guessed that it was some ten miles cut to sea, and they
only saw it for a second or so before it was out of range behind the buildings. It
was travelling north west to south east.

Meanwhile reports are still being received confirming the details of last
week's "flying saucer".

[Redacted text] the Spanish Legation and his wife reported seeing the
[redacted text] hurled across the tranquil sky.

[Redacted text] and his wife were sitting on deck chairs in front of
their Garden City villa when they saw it approaching from the south at a great speed.

"It was flying at a height," he said, "and over Tripoli it came down low, went
along vertically and then shot upwards. It was a quiet peaceful night and we are
quite sure it was not an aeroplane. There was positively no sound."

"My wife, who saw it a second or two before I did, says it left a glowing tail,
but I did not notice that."

"It came and went in about six or seven seconds. The light seemed to go out as
if a lamp had been extinguished rather than a gradual disappearance of the whole from
view."

Four Italian residents of Tripoli seated on their balconies near the Tobacco
Monopoly Building also report seeing the "saucer" last week.

They thought it was a meteorite until suddenly they realised it was going up
instead of down.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Captain Morey B. Jeffrey, Intelligence Officer, 7th Air Rescue Squadron has
injected the possibility that the unidentified object sighted 22 September 1952
was a weather balloon. The 27th Weather Squadron, based at Wheelus Field, Tripoli,
sends up four weather balloons daily, at 0300, 0600, 1500 and 2100.

1. At approximately 1110 hrs, on 17 September 1952, while flying near Big Wife, observed his wife, shiny, large, unidentified flying object in the vicinity of the river. The first group of three objects appeared to be in closely close formation (see diagram A). The object was observed to be flying at an extremely slow rate of speed, turning in a generally circular pattern. This was noted by Capt. Furstenberg and the same was noted by the base operations. The object was first sighted as it was turning at a slightly higher altitude and then descended to a few feet above the river view.

1. All six objects appeared to be of the same shape, size, and color. Mr. Huntingsworth stated that they were generally circular (see diagram fig), and very bright with a color. During the second sighting it was noted that a B-50, taking off from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base crossed under his line of vision to the objects then with total length of the formation of objects was about 5 as long as the B-50. Both the B-50 and the formation were below his line of the Tucson Mountains.

No exhaust trails and no propulsion noted although any noise from these objects in the second sighting would have been noticed directly as the objects that time. The objects in the first formation were traveling in a general northwest straight line course at what appeared to be a very slow rate of speed. The second formation was traveling on a northwesterly course at a faster rate of speed than the first formation but much slower than any airplane in his experience.

2. Time sighted: 1st Formation 1130 lasted for about two minutes.
   2nd Formation 1110 lasted for about two minutes.

3. Manner of Observation: Visual only. [redacted] was wearing dark polarized glasses and was able to see the objects for a longer period of time than his wife who wore no glasses.

4. Location of Observation: In sighting 30 60' Long/ 110° 50' 20" W
The two were located near the Catalina Highway about 1 mile east of the first observed position. One first observed the objects while passing between the last two peaks in the northern end of the Tucson Mountain Range. The distance, if the observer judged correctly would be about 20 miles. The general direction appeared near the southern end of this range of mountains (see diagram A).

5. Identifying Information on Observer:
   a. In 30 years of age, in good physical health and above
      average intelligence. At the University of Arizona, in the Main Corporation
      and a part-time student at the University of Arizona.

   b. [redacted] is in good physical health, above average in intelligence and by profession a housewife.

   c. Mr. [redacted] said his wife was to be absolutely sincere and thoroughly convinced they saw something. Neither has ever seen anything similar before.

6. Weather and Wind Conditions: 1130 EST 17 September 1952
