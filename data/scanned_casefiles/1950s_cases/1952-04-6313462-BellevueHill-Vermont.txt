AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Vermont, USA
3 May 1952
Date of Information: 24 April 1952
Major Natcher M. Jack, Intelligence Off.   Crew of C-124

Report originally submitted by TWX on 26 April 1952 1800Z LTR 1409

On 24 April 1952 at 0500 hours EST, a crew of C-124 type aircraft assigned to the 1st Strategic Support Squadron, Elgin AFB, Texas, sighted while flying eastward in saucers. The observation took place approximately Vermont at 40 degrees 50 minutes North, 72 degrees 15 minutes West at 11,000 feet. The crew of the C-124 aircraft heading was 73 degrees magnetic. Approximately 20 degrees to the right of the C-124, just above the horizon was three objects, later described as formation. For approximately two or three minutes, the objects paralleled the aircraft's course and direction. The objects were cylindrical, gray in color, with no visible means of propulsion. They were approximately 50 miles in distance and their size was about 1/2 the size of the C-124 aircraft. The objects were in a tight, vapor trail or exhaust could be observed. They traveled at high speed and with their altitude very rapidly. The objects were estimated to be 50 miles in distance and their size about 1/2 the size of the C-124. Winds were from 230 degrees at 45 knots.

1st Lt. Capt. Cappola, Pilot, Co-pilot, Navigator, and 8/Sgt crew member.

During this period of sighting, the above crew was supporting the 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, which was deploying six (6) B-36 aircraft to Limestone AFB Maine, on a simulated combat mission.
