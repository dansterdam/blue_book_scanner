Case 210, Pasadena, Cal., Sept. 6, 1956- The Los Angeles Times reported that members of the Air Force and the GOC spotted a strange light which moved erratically in the night sky for 47 minutes. According to the Times, 1st Lt. Mark Matlock of the Air Defense Command said, "Pasadena police had many calls from people who saw it. So did we. Our first call was from a Western Air Lines pilot. I hurried to the roof of our building and saw a white light in the sky. It was moving along northwest. It kind of paused and jerked in flight and then would make along. I knew it wasn't a conventional aircraft." ... Finally two jets were scrambled.14
