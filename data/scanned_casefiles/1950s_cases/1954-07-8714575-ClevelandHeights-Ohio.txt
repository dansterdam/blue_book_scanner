DATE July 9 1954

I was driving home from an apartment with an insurance prospect. I was driving on Mayfield Road, in a westerly direction, approaching Lee Road. I bright object out of my right wind-shield caught my attention. It was an object shaped somewhat like a saucer-wing, as viewed from the side, or a football that might have been suspended in the middle from the top and bottom. It was sort of a smokey-white in color, and as I watched it, moving very slow (in round figures) had a speed of about 20 miles per hour, and had now slowed down to about 5 miles per hour. Passing over Lee, I turned to the right, called from Lee to Euclid to get a better look. However, as I rather might if it were falling. As I drove along, trees and buildings came between me and a sight of the object. I was approaching Lee Road, so when I reached Lee, I turned to the right. Called up the car, that off the motor of my car, and got out. I observed around this car and up to the west, and could clearly see the object. It was hanging almost directly over the trees. I could see no clouds anywhere. It was dull, and almost totally dark by this time. I watched this object, parked the car, got out, and watched it. It seemed to move in a circle action, somewhat like a muzzle does when it realizes its prey. As it still moves, it "used" first to one side, and then to the other, like the turning ballet.

[A hand-drawn sketch of a circular object with a dotted line showing its movement]

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

It looked much like a smoke-ring would look if viewed from the side. Almost like a football, almost in the middle size. The color of it was white, then changed to a turkey-white, until it changed to a reddish color as it sped away.
