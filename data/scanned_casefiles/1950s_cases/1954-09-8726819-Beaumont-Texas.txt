When first sighted object resembled very bright star that
did not appear to be moving. When object passed to right
appeared to be a series of lights in a straight flight
similar to the fuselage of an a/c in shape of cigar. Passed
above observers at about 6 or 8,000 ft. Lights brighter
than acft cabling lights. No running lights. Exhaust did
not flame or wing were visible. No color visible. No discernible features or details except that appeared to be rectangular windows in row. No sound, sighting made from acft in flight. Disappeared to the West at what appeared to be the speed of a fast trans a/c.
