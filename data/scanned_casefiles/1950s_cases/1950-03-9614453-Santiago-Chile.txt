Report No. TR-42-50
AF-165200-1
Subject: Flying Discs
From: Air Attaché, Chile
Date of Report: 30 Mar 50
Date of Information: current
Evaluation: F-0
Prepared by: Harry L. Mitchell, Major, USAF
Source: Newspaper reports and personal observations of Air Attaché Office personnel.

1. Flying discs are being "seen" in various parts of Chile. First sighting was at Punta Arenas, lat 53°06' S, long 70°53'W on 11 Mar at noon. Many inhabitants of the city witnessed this phenomenon which appeared northeast of the city and traveled toward the southwest. Usual description was given--extreme altitude, silvery in color, shaped like a ping-pong ball. The Director of the Observatorio Astronomico of the University of Chile, Prof. Federico Rutland, made a statement to the local press that what the people were seeing was the planet Venus with a clearly visible thin line of year at that latitude.

2. Second sighting of a disc took place in the Santiago area, San Bernardo and Valparaiso on the 24th and 25th of March with the usual description given by the populace being quoted in the local press.

3. Third sighting of a disc occurred 28 March between 1330 and 1410 over Santiago, Chile. Downtown area was crowded with people looking into the sky observing this phenomenon. M/Sgt. Paterson, 624-9735, assigned to this office as a 502, personally observed an object traveling at an extreme rate of speed and altitude. (See attached statement and diagram.)

COMMENT: On 29 March this observer saw a silver colored, stationary object in the same relative position as was witnessed by the local populace the preceding day, and after careful observation concluded it to be the planet Venus and not a flying disc.

Professor Rutland (par 1) repeated his statement to the press today that the object had to be Venus.

Local press has headlined "flying disc" dispatches from all countries reporting sightings.

STATEMENT

On the 28 Mar 50 at approximately 1430 hours I was returning from my home at 1057 Vitacura to the U.S. Embassy for the afternoon's work period. I noticed numerous persons outside looking at the sky enroute to the U.S. Embassy. I did not stop or talk to anyone until I arrived at the U.S. Embassy. I immediately came to the 9th floor and started looking out of the window. Nothing was sighted. I then decided to go to the roof of the Embassy building. I borrowed from the U.S. Navy Attache a pair of field glasses and proceeded to the top of the Embassy building with the sole thought in mind that I would discover some illusion, perhaps a cloud wisp or a reflection from an object and thereby convince myself that there was nothing present in the sky. I was on the roof of the U.S. Embassy for approximately one hour and was constantly scanning the sky with both my normal eyes and with the field glasses. At approximately 1515 hours I detected an object traveling from south to north at an extreme altitude and at an extreme rate of speed. I detected this object with my naked eye and was then able to look at it through the field glasses. The height of the object made it impossible to determine any details about it. Other than that it appeared to be moving in a straight line. It appeared to be more white than any other color. I watched the object move approximately 30 degrees of sky within 5-10 seconds and then decided that I would return to the office and procure a camera with a telephoto lens and attempt to get a spot on a piece of film to support my story. I returned to the roof of the U.S. Embassy with the camera equipped with a telephoto lens and was unable to spot the object again. A small graph is furnished in relation to point of sight and the object seen in relation to the sun.
