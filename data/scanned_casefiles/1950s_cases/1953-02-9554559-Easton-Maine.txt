STATEMENT

Between 2030 hours and 2130 hours, either 23 February 1953, or 24 February 1953, as I was about to retire for the evening, I do not remember the exact date) I observed an unusual light from the west window of my bedroom. My bedroom is located on the first floor in the northwest corner of my home. The light was first observed as I was about to close the venetian blind in the window and it appeared above the crest of the hill west of my home. There are two (2) houses located on the crest of the hill, both two (2) story, and the light was between these houses and slightly from the ground to the roof of the houses. The direction at this point would be slightly Northwest from my home.

When I first observed this light, it appeared to be circular in shape, four (4) or five (5) times larger than any star visible at that time. The light was dark red in color and its seemed to lose some of its intensity in brightness before it disappeared below the crest of the hill. It was not possible for me to determine whether the light was traveling west and therefore disappeared behind the crest of the hill. I had the distinct impression that the light moved slightly toward the North before it disappeared. I judge the total time I watched this light to be three (3) to four (4) minutes. The sky at this time was very clear, the stars were out and the wind was slight. I would definitely say that this light was not a star.

I would like to state that I have lived in this same home for twenty (20) years and at no time is it possible to observe the attention lights on "Quassy Reef", (a nearby maritime installation) or any of the other lights at Presque Isle Air Force Base, from this particular point.

I dismissed the importance of this light from my mind until my daughter returned home from the city of Presque Isle the following week-end and told me about a certain Mrs. Cambridge, who works in the same office with my daughter. Sometime later, Mrs. Cambridge spoke to me at a meeting in the city of Presque Isle on the night of 23 February 1953. I immediately assumed it must have been the very same light which I had observed, but, at no time have I discussed the subject with her.

CRUISING ALTITUDES

CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - During VFR conditions aircraft at altitudes of 3000 feet or more above the surface within control zones and control areas, including controlled airways, must be flown at odd or even 1000-foot levels appropriate to the direction of flight. "Odd" and "Even" indicators are shown on Coast and Geodetic Survey Radio Facility Charts. Under VFR conditions within control zones and control areas, including controlled civil airways, altitudes will be flown in accordance with VFR rules.

The following rules will govern the altitude at which aircraft shall fly when making VFR flights along controlled civil airways:

Green and Red Airways and Even-numbered VOR Airways
Eastbound Flights: Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).
Westbound Flights: Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet).

Northbound Flights: Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).
Southbound Flights: Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet).

The following rules will apply on segments where color airway and VOR airways overlap.
Where a color airway coincides with a VOR airway, the ODD or EVEN rule for the appropriate color airway will apply.
Where no color airway is involved and an Even-numbered VOR airway and an Odd-numbered VOR airway coincide, the ODD or EVEN altitude rule will apply.

CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as illustrated below.

[A circular diagram with aircraft positions at different magnetic courses is shown]

VISUAL FLIGHT PLAN

The Civil Air Regulations do not require that a VFR flight plan be filed for a VFR flight. However, the filing of such a flight plan is desirable, and the CAA urges that VFR flights be covered by flight plan whenever practicable as such filing materially assists in search and rescue operations if such action becomes necessary. Flight plans may be submitted to the nearest CAA airway communications station either in person or by telephone. Flight plans may be filed by radio if no other means are available but this practice should be avoided whenever possible to reduce congestion of radio channels.

ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

TO FIND THE EFFECT OF ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE
CONNECT THE TEMPERATURE AND AIRPORT ALTITUDE
BY A STRAIGHT LINE.

READ THE INCREASE IN TAKE-OFF DISTANCE AND THE
DECREASE IN RATE OF CLIMB FROM STANDARD SEA
LEVEL VALUES HERE

This diagonal line shows that 220% must
be added for a temperature of 100° and a pressure
altitude of 5,000 feet. Therefore, if your standard
sea level take-off distance, for example, is 1,000
feet, and the temperature is 100° and the pressure
density would become 3,300 feet under the conditions shown. In addition, the rate of climb would
be increased 76%. Also, if your normal sea level
rate of climb is 500 feet per minute, it would become
120 feet per minute.

This chart indicates typical representative values for "personal" airplanes.
For exact values consult your airplane flight manual.
The chart may be conservative for airplanes with supercharged engines.
Also remember that long grass, sand, mud or deep snow can easily double
your take-off distance.

LOSS OF AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE DURING HOT WEATHER

Thin Air Reduces Lift. You get thin air at high altitudes and in hot weather. The hotter the temperature, the thinner the air.

Do you realize that Kansas City Airport with an elevation of 744 feet above sea level can have an effective elevation identical to Stapleton Field, Denver, at 5,329 feet above sea level, under conditions of extreme heat and low pressure?

Do you realize that Brees Airport at Laporte, warning at 7,271 feet above sea level, can be above the safe operational altitude of your aircraft during hot weather?

Note: The effective elevation of Brees Airport at 86°F, for example, is 10,250 feet-Caution! The rarified air at higher altitudes lowers the efficiency of engine and propeller, and lessens a plane's rate of climb. A typical flight plane has a maximum rate of climb of 420 feet per minute, whereas its normal rate of climb at 5,000 foot altitude is only 225 feet per minute.

This plane might be able to clear a 100 foot hill or factory stack located a few miles from a sea level airport, but if the pilot tried it at 5,000 feet, he would smack into the middle of the obstruction.

Remember: Any increase in operating altitude (due to elevation or high temperature) greatly increases takeoff and landing roll.

[The document includes two illustrations showing aircraft performance at sea level and at 5000 foot elevation, with distance markers from 250 to 2250 feet.]

CRUISING ALTITUDES

WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - During VFR conditions aircraft at altitudes of within control zones and control areas, including controlled airways must be flown at odd thousands of feet when operating in level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).

Westbound Flights. Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).

Northbound Flights. Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet).

Amber and Blue Airways and Odd-numbered VOR Airways. Southbound Flights. Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet).

The following rules will apply on airways where color airways and VOR airways overlap:

Where a color airway coincides with a VOR airway, the ODD or EVEN rule for the appropriate color airway will apply.

Where no color airway is involved and an Even-numbered and an Odd-numbered VOR airway coincide, the ODD or EVEN altitude rule will apply.

CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as illustrated below.

ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

TO FIND THE EFFECT OF ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE
FOLLOW THE TEMPERATURE AND ALTITUDE LINE
BY A STRAIGHT LINE.

READ THE INCREASE IN TAKE-OFF DISTANCE AND THE
DECREASE IN RATE OF CLIMB FROM STANDARD SEA
LEVEL VALUES HERE

ADD THIS PERCENTAGE TO
YOUR NORMAL TAKE-OFF DISTANCE

EXAMPLE: The diagonal line shows that 250° must
be added for a temperature of 100° and a pressure
altitude of 6,000 feet. Therefore, if your standard
temperature sea level take-off distance, in order to
climb to 500 feet, normally requires 1,000 feet of
runway, it would become 1,500 feet under the
conditions shown. In addition, the rate of climb would
be reduced from 500 feet per minute to 250 feet per
rate of climb is 500 feet per minute, it would become
120 feet per minute.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED LIGHT

I. DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT:
One (1) milky-white light alternating in color to pink red for short durations, unspecified shape two (2) to three (3) times larger than the light star in the area, initially no aerodynamic features, proceeding at the beginning of observation North and later altering its course to North-west. Gradual loss in size and intensity with simultaneous orange in color from milky-white during the last stage of observation.
See Enclosure #1, this report.

II. TIME OF SIGHTING:
First stationary sighting made at 2055 hrs EST. Second stationary sighting conducted at 2120 hrs EST. The initial and last stationary sighting took place at 2110 hrs EST. Visual observation from the vehicle in motion conducted during the entire intervals between times indicated above.

III. MANNER OF OBSERVATION:
Only surface observation conducted. No optical or electronic equipment was used. Motions of the light were established by the observers with the help of stationary objects (telephone pole).

IV. LOCATION OF OBSERVERS:
Initial sighting made from the Eastern outskirts of WESTFIELD, MAINE (N46°34'W67°02'), second sighting conducted from the vicinity of FOUR CORNERS (N46°34'W67°02'), approximately two (2) miles West of WESTFIELD. During these observations the light was at an azimuth of approximately 275° from the position of observers proceeding North. West observation conducted from the vicinity of AROOSTOOK UNION ROAD (N46°38'W67°59'), approximately four (4) miles North West on U.S. Highway #1. During that time a change in light direction from North to North-West was observed. No estimate of distance or altitude given by the observers. Approximate elevation of the light during the initial stage of observation believed to be 25°. (See Sketch, Enclosure #2, this report).

V. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF OBSERVERS:
The observers were identified as Mr and Mrs [REDACTED] presently residing at [REDACTED] PRESQUE ISLE, MAINE. Mr [REDACTED] served as a 37th with the 217th AAA Bn during "W" II in Stand possesses a prior knowledge of aerial observation and identification as well as very good knowledge of the area described in this report. Both are well educated and of above average intelligence. They appear to be very reliable.

VI. WEATHER:
Weather conditions were good at the time of the observations. Ceiling and visibility unlimited, wind surface 320 degrees at seven (7) mph, at 18,000 foot 320 degrees at 45 knots per hour. The moon was out and the stars were clearly distinguished.

We reached a point on the highway near the Aroostook Union Grange Hall where we parked again for approximately two (2) minutes. At this time the light seemed to be farther away, considerably lower, smaller in size and less intense. We lined it again with a telephone pole on the opposite side of the highway and once again was established beyond any doubt that the light was moving in the Northerly direction.

We resumed our journey toward Presque Isle, still observing the light through the left windows of our car. We noticed that it changed the direction from North to North-West and seemed to lose further on the intensity and size and its round arc made of red as indicated gradually away. Upon entering Presque Isle we lost contact with the light at approximately 110 hrs.

We are very familiar with the area described above and the location of permanent orientation light is known to us. We compared the light with the brightest star in the area and found it to be two (2) to three (3) times bigger. Furthermore, we established beyond any doubt that the light was making the above described motions during the entire fifteen (15) minutes of observation. Weather conditions were very good during the entire observation, with excellent visibility, clear sky, no wind, moon out and all stars clearly distinguished.

STATEMENT

Presque Isle, Maine
27 February 1953

On 25 February 1953, at approximately 2055 hrs., myself and my wife were
driving in main car, Presque Isle to Caribou, Maine, following nearly 1/2 mile
relative to Westfield, Maine, when about entering our car noticed several North
on the east meridians of Eastville, we not now an unusually bright, silky-
white, stationary light. We remained in the area for approximately 10-15
minutes to estimate the approximate distance and altitude of the light.

This light seemed to be located in the northeastern direction of the evening
star, however, it was much closer to the horizon, larger in size and brighter
in intensity. We turned our car around and proceeded stationary through West
Field towards the highway. We were within clear view of the light. This was
to could observe the light much more clearly through the windshield of our car. The
light appeared to be about 1/2 mile. Our observation was momentarily impeded
by trees and snowing in the area. However, it was possible to get a good
point of the time when our car was on the Westfield Road.

Arriving at the junction of Westfield Road and Highway 1, we noticed
a late model automobile. Light is color, usually 1950 Pontiac, parked near
the junction with the same highway. While the driver of the car was
talking to someone in the area, other occupants of the car, more than two (2),
had their faces turned toward the light and probably were observing it. We
not seeing any instance of this car.

Upon reaching the more wooded junction, we headed north on the highway
9.1, toward Presque Isle. At that time the light became more intense and we
decided to investigate it more closely. We turned our car on the east side
of the highway, in the vicinity of so-called "Four Corners". We remained
there for approximately three (3) minutes and noticed that the light was considerably lower than observed before and it was changing the color. From milky-
white it turned to pink-red for the duration of approximately thirty (30) seconds
and then remained the milky-white color again.

I would like to add, that I am a former F/O with 217th Mobile AAA Bn,
(90 mm), 3rd US Army, and I am familiar with principles of aerial observation,
having substantial combat experience in ETO during WW II, with the above named
organization.

After we verified the car near "Your Corners" on lower the windows and
listened to traffic for any signs, we were unable to hear the light. Its next
near any, however, we were able to determine with the aid of a telephone pole
on the east side of the highway, that the light was traveling slowly toward
the north - will not estimate the exact distance, but it was possibly
the light - still proceeding north - diagonally toward the Green Corners located
approximately 1 1/2 miles north of our location.

We are unable to notice the light retracing slowly from behind the very low foothills, also located approximately one (1) mile east of Highway #1, and constituting
a dimly lit sometimes area of Green Mountain.
