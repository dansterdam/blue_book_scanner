but we never saw anything so we
headed back towards town by following
the county roads when we got over with
the city dump I looked towards some hills
in the east not then it was very low
above this one hill my brother saw it
too and then as far either who I saw and
and sat will look no way. We watched the
only way it went was up. While it
was very low the brightness of its lights
slight could be seen better then after it
got up higher, blinking Red, blue, at will
could you place tell me what they
could have been in we or all around
my home not at Oakland Woodbury what it
was.

might again given it was at about 12:30 at
night. I only saw it for about 30 sec
but the lights could some Red, blue
and white only the blue was out at a certain
blue this time. There are no exact details
I hope you can tell me what they
were. Some say it was a Halloween other
sure. - Think? Hallucino would make a noise.

1. This office has received many inquiries from individuals and UFO clubs requesting the Air Force evaluation of UFO reports, some of which the Air Force never received. The time required to honor such requests would prevent the office staff from performing their primary duty of analysis.

2. The Air Force viewpoint concerning so-called "flying saucers" is well known. No evidence has been found to type their existence.

3. The following sightings referenced by Mr. Kaiser, were not received by this office:
   a. 15 Dec. 1955, Cambridge
   b. 3 Jan. 1958, Pasadena
   c. January 1957, Florida

Many such sightings are reported to newspapers, UFO clubs, or to individuals and never reach the Air Force.

Office Of The Secretary Of Defence
Washington 25, D. C.

Sirs:

Please send me affirmation that the following reports of Unidentified Flying Objects are, or are not Flying Saucers and if not, why.

December 15, 1955 -- Cambridge- At 5 p.m. a girl of 12 saw a " huge round object, spinning around, and humming." The object seemed to be giving off a white light.
At the same time the girl's 25 year old brother some miles away reported seeing a " brilliant object in the sky."

27 Dec 55
Yakobu, Vatulele, Fiji Islands

METALLIC FRAGMENTS SPRAY OVERHEAD

Case 127, Yakobu, Vatulele, Fiji Islands, reported December 27, 1955.—Whatever the origin and purpose of the fireball and its inexplicable behavior, etc. much the same ranging miles, we look searchingly to other relative events for a possible clue. Such a clue may be found in the report reaching us from Suva in the Fiji Islands, The Auckland Star, December 27, '55 reported: "During a lightning storm, the village of Yakobu, in Vatulele, was showered with metallic fragments of all sizes. Nobody was hurt. A possible explanation, said the Star, "was that a meteorite exploded at a low level, causing a dash thought by the islanders to be lightning. Such an explosion could have caused a shower of metallic fragments. Samples of the metallic shower are to be sent to the Fiji Mines Department."

Harold Fulton, of C.S.I.R.O., New Zealand, who sent CRIFO the news item noted: "I am writing to Vepuele authorities for samples of the metallic shower." Perhaps remote, in connection with the Fiji incident, but not so remote. A partial analysis of the Fiji Islands affair, the Joyita. This 70 ton cruiser, which steamed out of Apia in Samoa on Oct. 3 and had 25 persons aboard, vanished without trace. No one was aboard. Uncontrolled. Was the Joyita mysteriously destroyed? We have no way of knowing but the Joyita may have experienced a unique "tight spot" in the Yakobu area.

METALLIC FRAGMENTS SPRAY OVER FIJI

Case 127, Yakobu, Vatulele, Fiji Islands, reported December 22, 1955.—Whatever the origin and purpose of the fireball and its inexplicable behavior, i.e., much like a raging missile, we look searchingly to other relative events for a possible clue. Such a clue may be found in the report reaching us from Suva in the Fiji Islands. The Auckland Star, December 27, '55 reported, "During a lightning storm, the village of Yakobu, in Vatulele, was showered with metallic fragments of all sizes. Nobody was hurt. A possible explanation, said the Star, "was that a meteorite exploded at a low level, causing a flash thought by the islanders to be lightning. Such an explosion could have caused a shower of meteorite fragments. Samples of the metallic shower are to be sent to the Fiji Mines Department."

Harold Fulton, of C.S.I, New Zealand, who sent CRIFO the news item, noted, "I am writing to Vatulele authorities for samples of the metallic shower." Perhaps remote, in connection with the Fiji incident, but not so remote by nautical miles is the bizarre affair of the Joyita. This 70 ton cruise, which steamed out of Apia in Western Samoa for the Tokelau Islands, Oct. 3, 1955, had 25 people aboard, but for some mysterious reason the vessel did not reach the Tokelaus. It was found on November 10 "wallowing listlessly in a light sea" reported Life magazine, but no one was aboard. Unaccountable was the burned-out semi-circular section on topside. We have no way of knowing, but the Joyita may have experienced a similar "lightning storm" like that over Yakobu.

Eerie Fireball Seen Again at Ord

The second appearance of a floating fireball has been reported at Ord and a mysterious colored light has been reported near Fremont.

Two Burwell women, Mrs. Clarence Miner, and Mrs. James Cunningham were driving on Highway 11 near Ord about 9 p.m. one evening recently.

Here is Mrs. Miner's story as reported by the weekly Ord Quiz:

"We were driving fairly slow and were about 2 miles out and just passed the Ord cemetery. We saw the strangest ball rise out of a cornfield and soar a pace and are cornfield across his highway. I immediately turned to Mrs. Cunningham and said, 'What did you see?'

Mrs. Cunningham answered: 'I saw a strange fireball.'

The women said the fireball was about the size of a large grapefruit and was traveling at a high rate of speed and was quite visible all the time it was in flight.

Mrs. Cunningham said I traveled about 75 feet high. She said it wasn't frightened but was surprised.

Later they went back to investigate and found nothing.

This is an artist's conception of the fireball two Burwell women saw near Ord.

Last summer Dan Wray, an Ord High School youth, said he saw a mysterious green fireball near Ord dashed in mid air while returning home from Loop City.

On the same night Wes Hosek of Ord saw a large white light which later blacked out and left a patch of red, blue and white. He said he was driving on Highway 77 near Lyons to Oakland when he saw the light.

The most night, he said, he saw the same light again for about 30 miles west of Oakland.

An illustration accompanies the text, showing a stylized fireball or light arcing over a landscape with a sun or bright object in the upper right corner.

Dear Sirs,

I am writing you to find out some information about a certain thing I saw, Dec. 30-31 1955. I was traveling from Lyons, Nebr. to Oakland, where I was at time, on my way to see in this west a big white light in our apply. 10:a.m. above the ground not moving, that I could tell when I got to Oakland I went a mile south of town and then down a road, stepped up and here I could see this light. It was blinking red, blue and white. I set it distance away at about 2 miles from where I was and about 100' high or less it was blinking and not moving. I went back to turn out my brother. We went out this and it was gone, before it had not moved so I could tell, we looked south further and we saw it down south way low as it was moving to the highway on U.S. 77 for about
