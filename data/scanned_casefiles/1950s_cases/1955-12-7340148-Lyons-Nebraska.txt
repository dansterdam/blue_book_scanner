Office of The Secretary of Defense
Washington 25, D.C.

Sirs:
Please send me affirmation that the following reports of Unidentified Flying Objects are, or are not Flying Saucers and if so:

December 15, 1955 - Cambridge.- At 5 p.m. a girl of 12 years seemed to be viewing a round object around. The object seemed to be giving off a white light. At the same time the girl [was] seen an old brother some miles away reported seeing a "brilliant object in the sky."

The shared image contains a photograph of what appears to be a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document discusses the case of "Metallic Fragments Spray Over Vessel" that occurred on December 27, 1955 in Yakohia, Vatulele, Fiji Islands.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCE: CRIFO Newsletter, 3 Feb 56

METALLIC FRAGMENTS SPRAY OVER VESSEL 
Can 1227, Yakohia, Vatulele, Fiji Islands, December 27, 1955 - Whatever the origin and purpose of the objects (described as the inexplicable behavior) is much like the Auckland Star, December 27, '55 reported, during a lighting storm in the Fiji Islands. The Auckland Star reported on this incident, which resulted in a shower of metallic fragments that rained down on a vessel near Vatulele. Nobody was hurt. A passable explanation, said the Star, was that the metallic particles as a blinding-effect, caused by lightning. Such an explanation is plausible, but no evidence is given to confirm this. Harold Fulton, of CRIFO, New Zealand, who has made a study of such incidents, is not convinced.

The image does not contain any photograph, it is a page from an old UFO report document. The text on the page describes an incident related to "Metallic fragments spray over Fiji" that occurred in Yakoba, Vatulele, Fiji Islands on December 27, 1955. The text provides details about the incident, including the sighting of a "ranging missile" and a "possible explanation" that a meteorite explosion could have caused a "shower of meteorite fragments". The text also mentions the involvement of Harold Fulton of CSIR New Zealand in the investigation of this incident.

METALLIC FRAGMENTS SPRAY OVER FIJI
Case 127, Yakoba, Vatulele, Fiji Islands - reported December 27, 1955. Witnesses: the origin and purpose of
the fragments are uncertain. While the villagers were
a ranging missile, we look searchingly to other relative
events for a possible clue. Such a clue may be found in
the Auckland Star, December 27, '55 reported, "During a
lightning storm, the village of Yakoba, in Vatulele, was
struck by a fire ball and an old woman was hurt. A possible
explanation said the Star, was
that a meteoritic explosion at a low level, causing a flash,
could have created the trouble at Yakoba. Samples of the
fragments are now being analysed. What the metallic shower
could have caused of the meteorite fragments to be sent to
earth are to determine, and the results are awaited."
Harold Fulton, of C.S.I.R. New Zealand, who sent
C.R.I.F.O. the news item, noted "I am writing to Vatulele
requesting additional information. The Fiji incident, but
not too remote, connection with the Fiji incident, does
so remote by connection with the bizarre affair of the
Joh. V. Western Samoa cruiser, which steamed out of
in 1952 covered with a fluorescent glow
as the vessel did not reach the Tokelaus. It was found on
December 10 following, disabled in a light rain off the
Alofa Islands of the Jomard Islands group. Understandable
was the burned-out semi-circular section on
report. We have no way of knowing, but the Vatulele
incident may have been a similar lightning phenomenon.

The image contains a photograph of an artist's conception of a large fireball or UFO seen in the sky. The text accompanying the image provides details about the sighting, including that it was reported by Mrs. O'Connor, a resident of Ord, Nebraska, who observed the fireball while driving on Highway 11 near Ord.

Eerie Fireball Seen Again at Ord
The mysterious firetell that has been reported at
intervals has been seen again in the vicinity of Ord.
The latest report concerning it was made by Mrs.
O'Connor, a resident of Ord.
Mrs. O'Connor was driving along Highway 11 near
Ord when she saw the fireball. She said it appeared to
be about two miles away and about 100 feet off the
ground. It was traveling at a high rate of speed, she
said.
The fireball was described as being shaped like a cigar
and having a glowing tail. Mrs. O'Connor said it
appeared to change color from white to orange and
back again as it traveled across the sky.
Several persons in the Ord vicinity have reported
seeing this fireball at intervals during the past year or
more. Some claim to have observed it come within a
few feet of the ground before shooting back up into
the sky.
The Ord cemetery caretaker said he had seen the
fireball several times hovering over the cemetery. A
motorist said he saw it pass over the highway just
ahead of him.
The fireball has been described by various witnesses
as being from 30 to 80 feet long. It is said to travel at
a high rate of speed, making sharp turns and then
darting upwards at a steep angle.
There has been much speculation in the Ord vicinity
as to the nature of the fireball. Some believe it is a
mysterious celestial phenomenon, while others think
it may be some type of aircraft.
Residents of the Ord area are keeping a close watch
for any further appearances of the fireball.

RECEIVED
Jail 13 1956

Dear Sirs,
I am writing you to give out some information about a certain thing I seen Dec. 30-31 1955. I was traveling home from Sioux City to Omaha on my way home when I saw an object 4 or 5 miles away from where I was on my way home. After looking at it for a while I could tell it was not an airplanes or anything else I had ever seen before and it was hovering right above the ground. It seemed to have a bluish light all around it and slowly moved in front of me as I was driving. When I got a mile or so closer to it I decided I want a mile closer to get a better look at it and as I got closer to it it suddenly took off at an unbelievable speed and was out of sight in just a matter of a few seconds. I was amazed at this and I felt I should report it to someone but I didn't know who to report it to so I kept it to myself until now. I hope this information I have given you will be of help to you in your investigations and if you have any questions I will be glad to answer them to the best of my knowledge.
Yours truly,
Firman Miller
