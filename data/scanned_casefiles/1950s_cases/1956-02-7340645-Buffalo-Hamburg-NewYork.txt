AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-D, 46020A AIB8
Incl. #1: PART TWO, Report of RD-UPON-1-56
Station: UNCLASSIFIED

On Feb 29, 1956 at 6:50 p.m. I had observed a bright light in the sky, which appeared to be pulsating at intervals. I soon saw the bright-lighted object which was also seen by 2 other persons approximately 60 feet away, moving at a fairly rapid rate of speed. After moving a short distance, it stopped overhead for about 10 seconds, then moved off at a rapid rate of speed and was soon out of sight. The object was described as round and as bright as a star at times, then would dim to a pale light and then brighten up again. Two other persons who were with me at the time saw the object and brought it to the attention of the attendant at the gasoline station where I went to telephone the report. The attendant also observed the object and stated that he had also seen the same type of object on previous occasions. This was the first time I had observed this type of object and I could not identify it. I called into the Ritter Center and reported the second one of the same description, except for one detail which was that it had crossed the sky from east to west in one burst of speed instead of the erratic movements of the first one. I then called into the Ritter Center and reported the second one of the same description, except for one detail which was that it had crossed the sky from east to west in one burst of speed instead of the erratic movements of the first one. After the object had been out of sight for about 12 to 15 seconds, another one of the same description came into view in about the same spot and moved off to the south at a rapid rate of speed. I was still in the sky one overhead, and one about 4 or 5 miles to the S.E. The object appeared to be at about the same distance as it was all night. It then went out of sight behind some trees and I did not see it after that. I then waited for more than an hour and saw no other objects of the same description. I did not see it after that. I then waited for more than an hour and saw no other objects of the same description.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was rated, self-confident, and very precise in his experiences with anything of this nature and expressed a desire to do anything possible that might help uncover the actual facts. The case was thoroughly checked and verified by several of our more experienced and reliable officers, capable pilot and man of high integrity.

III. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT BY SOURCE: 
1. OBJECT, in the opinion of the SOURCE, was a 47th FIS, Regular F-86, Fighters of the 73rd Wing, Strategic Air Command, USAF, stationed at the Buffalo AOC Fighters Center. SOURCE believes this was a top priority mission of great importance.
2. OBJECT seemed to be greatly impressed with the brightness of the object. For the red light seen in the object when he was at an altitude of 32,000 feet, which changed to a white luminous color as the object climbed to approximately 50,000 feet. The speed and brilliant color of the object amazed the PILOT, and he has never seen anything like it before, comparing it to a nova-type searchlights without a beam reflector.

INCL: Lt. MART TILLIE, Rept. 3D-UFO-1-56
STATEMENT: 
After leveling out at 4000' indicated and contacting GCI, I was vectored into what appeared to be a star or bright object over the town portion of Buffalo, N.Y. As I approached this time I started to investigate more closely. In doing so it suddenly disappeared, but a short time later I again noticed it - this time lower in altitude, and closer to the edge of the Buffalo area. It was brighter than any other object in the area at the time and seemed to be pulsating or flashing on and off. I decided to take one last look, banked the A/C around, and there it was behind me - dead astern and slightly higher. I continued to maneuver with my radar equip. - that was operating very satisfactorily.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-E, 4602d AISS
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check with the 47th FIS Intelligence Section, Niagara Falls, AFB, revealed that Capt. G. E. RUFFE, USAF, who was on duty and could not be reached as of 1940, was the only individual concerned with the sighting. No other information could be immediately gained, as Capt. G. E. RUFFE was off duty and could not be reached. Attempts to contact him, by phone, were fully unsuccessful.
2. A trip was made to the Buffalo Filter Center, Buffalo, N.Y. (GEORGE OCHS) where a check was made, but no related information is the log of the 733rd AC & W Squadron on the UFOB the previous night. Lt. Charles TROUT, the commander, stated that no sighting or activity had been recorded or reported for this unit.
3. Lt. Roger J. L. ROYER, 0 Squadron was contacted. He had scrambled the F-86D on the basis of the "alert received from the Buffalo Filter Center". The pilot, Lt. Col James N. FAUST, stated that he had circled the area thoroughly but had not visually acquired or intercepted any unidentified object. No radar contacts were obtained during the period. The squadron was advised concerning unidentified lights over Eastern Lake ERIE (GEORGE OCHS data).
News from Capt. Earl FLAGG, Buffalo Filter Center, explained that the Buffalo controller had received a call concerning a lighted object in the sky. This object was then tracked on the radar scope of the Filter Center. As the object approached the base, Capt. FLAGG observed that the object was a normal aircraft in the area.
A. check with Capt. Keith JONES, Di/AAA representative, Lt. Col James N. FAUST, and Mr. Smith as to their reliability.
 Weather as of 1930 - 2100 hours EST: Scattered clouds to 3500 feet, Remainder of Night - Clear.
BUFFALO: Same as Niagara Falls.
Both Areas: No check or smoke in area where data was obtained (Niagara Falls) - No Moon - Set at 1300 EST, 29 Feb 56. Haze with visibility 2 miles.
A check was made with Division which revealed locations of lights and beacons shown in Incl 71.
7. A check was made with Di/AAA representative, Lt. Col James N. FAUST, who stated that radar was operational on the night of the 29th and that two (2) radar sets were on surveillance on the night of the 29th and that a target was not obtained. These people from the ACA units had not heard nor seen anything and their actual attempts at radar pick-up proved negative.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
a. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object was probably the planets Venus for the following reasons:
a. Using the process of elimination, the object was no doubt not the planet Venus.
b. T. A. Mannis and L.G. Dorman tend to support the possibility that the object could have been a glob of limited extent, but this also support their opinion that such a theory would be very difficult to agree with in view of symptoms more probable.
c. Bright objects of the type (morning star) Venus in the sky over the base that day could certainly not be cognizant of or notable in measures to the degree the witnesses stated the object to be - impossible.
d. The object was observed by one (1) observer for four (4) hours. These numbers could be meaningless or gross distortions due to the intense interest presumably experienced by the witness. The object was seen in the West, which is direction from which Venus would be arising.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
a. It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was definitely hypothetical in nature. The following details in support of the above:
a. The planet Venus was located at the same position as the UFO sighting body in the sky.
b. The long duration of the sighting.
c. Failure of airborne radar as well as three (3) ground radar sets to pick up the object.
d. The attempted air intercept by Captain Solena, Venus was suspected, but the poor direction of the object made it impossible to maintain visual contact and take the object was the approximate size of Venus.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight: 3-D, 4602d AISS
I. SOURCE: (Civilian)
Address: Hamburg, New York 
Age: Fifty-five (55)
Present Position: Accountant, Ben Otto Motors 
Education: Twelve (12) years, Accounting (extension course)
Qualifications: Accounting
RELIABILITY: SOURCE was mild mannered, and appeared to give much thought to the answers as a responsible member of his community. He is well known and considered a responsible member of his community. Due to his mild mannered and responsible nature, the information as stated by him is considered reliable.
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
The SOURCE was working at Ben Otto Motors on the corner of Clark and McKinley Parkway, Hamburg, New York. On Mar 56, he noticed a bright, silver colored object in the sky. He immediately observed the object for some time, as it appeared to be a "circular" shaped object with no visible means of propulsion, and hovering in a stationary position in the sky.
The night was clear with scattered clouds and a slight breeze. The object was observed to be oscillating or swinging with a pendulum-like motion due west from the observer's location. Object appeared to be approximately 100 yards in diameter, and was described as being without any details, except for a slight flatness on the bottom.
The object appeared to stand still to him, but never suddenly accelerated in any direction. After being observed for several seconds, the object began slowly accelerating to the north and disappeared from observation.
Observation was made over a period of one and one-quarters hours, but was actually seen for only thirty minutes due to cloud obstructions at various times. Similar observations had been made by others during the past.

At approximately 8 PM Feb. 29, 1956, I was working at Ben Otto Motors in Hamburg when the station attendant called me to come out to look at a strange object in the sky. The object was first observed to the west of Lake Erie or Canada. It appeared to be slowly move in a pendulum motion against the wind. The object moved close enough for me to get a good look at it and it appeared to be round and glowing. It remained in sight for about 10 minutes and then seemed to disappear over Lake Erie near Buffalo. It came back about 9:15 and it still was in the sky but appeared farther away.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-d, 46024 AT33
I. SOURCE: (Civilian GOC Observer)
Address: Lackawanna 15, New York
Age: 12
Present Position: High School Student 
Education: Ten (10) qualifications: GOC observer (3i years)

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a serious minded youth who appeared very interested in the GOC program. ACCORDING to his statement, his observations of various aircraft seemed to be high in accordance with that required of GOC observers. SOURCE's description was very consistent and made definite references to the size, shape and speed of objects observed. SOURCE is considered to be a fairly reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
1. On 29/23302 Feb 56, SOURCE was walking down South Shore Boulevard toward his home in Lackawanna, New York. He spotted five objects flying from the Southwest. He observed the objects for approximately five minutes. The objects were high in the sky. SOURCE said they appeared to be hovering. He estimated their size to be about the size of a house, and observed they made no sound. They were flying in a straight line and as he watched, one object appeared to separate and fall behind the other four. The objects were white in color.
2. SOURCE stated that he observed one object for a period of three hours and forty-five minutes. THIS object appeared to accelerate and ascend 25 to 40 miles east of the first object. This object was sighted for approximately twenty-five to forty miles east of the first object. This object was sighted for approximately twenty-five to forty miles east of the first object.
3. The first object gave off a bright white glow during the entire observation. The second object did reflect heat waves during their appearance.
4. During this observation of nearly four hours, SOURCE was in and out of his home, talked with his mother about objects and phoned Buffalo Police Center and reported his sighting.

SOURCE has been a similar type phenomena during past week while carrying out his duties as a GOC observer. FURTHER details are limited because of difficulty in determining EXACT details to SOURCE'S satisfaction at times and although they did not accelerate to any appreciable speed, both objects did move South across the sky.
