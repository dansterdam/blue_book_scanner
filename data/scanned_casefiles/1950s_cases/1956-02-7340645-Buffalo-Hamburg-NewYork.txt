Statement

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

On Feb 29, 1956 at 6:50 P.M. I had spotted a bright light in the sky, which I watched for about 5 mins before drawing it to anyone else's attention which when I did this person also saw the bright-lighted object. After I left this person I continued to walk up the street, and when I reached the top of our street and the object was still there I then went into a gas station and brought it to the attention of the attendant when I was sure he had also seen the object I then called the Filter Center. After I left the gas station I continued to observe this strange light when I noticed that was also another one or the same description except for one detail which was that it had a green - haze around the outside also in the sky about 25-40 miles away from the first one, when I was sure this was no mistake I made a second call into the Filter Center and reported the second one. I had observed the lights for about 4 hrs. before going into a building. At about that time I went into the home for about 15 min. I returned outside to find both objects still in the sky, one overhead, and one about 4 or 5 miles to the S.E. The second light disappeared about 15 - 20 mins after I came out. The last time, although I did not see it go, it was gone. But the first one was still at about the same distance as it was all night. It was quite low when I last saw the first one. I then went into the house and went to bed; so as I did not see it after then, I both w watched and several witnesses saw the object.

I. SOURCE: [Redacted], Captain, USAF
    Age: 30
    Duties: Fighter Pilot, 47th PIS, A/C Electronics Officer
    Education: 12 Years
    Military Tech Schools: Officer's Communications School
                            Scott AFB

                            F-86D Advanced Interceptor School

    Qualifications: Pilot - Electronics Officer
    Station: 47th PIS, Niagara Falls AFB, N. Y.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was relaxed, self-confident, and very precise in his manner as well as in his answers. SOURCE stated that this was his first experience with anything of this nature and expressed a desire to do anything possible to help in identification of the object. Other personnel in both the 763rd AC & V station and the 47th PIS stated that Capt Solon was an excellent officer, a capable pilot and a man of high integrity. SOURCE appeared to be the type of person who would employ the good reasoning powers to possessed in evaluating the situation. Therefore, in the investigator's opinion, information given by SOURCE is considered to be reliable.

III. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT BY SOURCE:

    1. SOURCE was on standby duty at 47th PIS, Niagara Falls AFB (GEORGE GJLP 5806) when he was scrambled by the 763rd AC & V station to intercept an unidentified flying object in the Hamburg, N.Y. (GEORGE GJLM 1042) area. The 763rd AC & V had been notified of this object by the Buffalo GOC PADAR Center. SOURCE arrived in an F-86D type aircraft at approximately 01/0210Z Mar 56 and flew to the Hamburg area.

    2. SOURCE then made visual contact with the object and retained his contact for the next 40-50 minutes. During the time of observation there were many stars, no moonlight, no clouds from 4,000 feet up, and no trace of daylight. SOURCE estimated actual size of the object to be larger than an aircraft, but at no time did it appear larger than a half dollar held at arm's length.

    3. SOURCE seemed to be greatly impressed with the brightness of the object. It always appeared to him to be of a white luminous color except for the red light seen in the object when he was at an altitude of 32,000 feet. The actual brightness of the object was never constant and it continually changed in intensity. SOURCE described the object as being similar to roving type searchlights without a beam reflector.

III. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT BY SOURCE: (Continued)

4. SOURCE had no definite opinion as to identity of the object, however, he was absolutely sure that it was not a contemporary aircraft. SOURCE did state that object could possibly be a refraction of light, but the processes causing such a phenomenon were unknown to him.

5. Object seemed to have the ability to maneuver with the aircraft and still maintain its distance. SOURCE tried to close on object several times with no apparent results.

Statement of CAPT, USAF

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

1. Departed Niagara Falls AFB at approximately 2110-29 Feb 56 after being notified by GCI that G.C.C. had reported some unidentified lies in the Hamburg Area of Buffalo, N.Y.

2. After leveling out at 4000' indicated and contacting XCI-I was vectored into the Hamburg Area of Buffalo, N.Y.

3. When I arrived over the Hamburg Area I did not notice any lies, but I did notice a large bright lite that appeared to be directly over the town portion of Buffalo, N.Y. at this time I start to investigate. My heading was 300 degrees magnetic - at first I thought it was a transport or a bomber - but I could not decrease my range from this object. At this time I thought this must be a star so I rotated back to the Hamburg Area - with the intention that this star would stay in the same relative position.

4. When arriving over Hamburg I look outside and there this was again - off my left wing. At this time I little confused. I then took up a heading of north and reaching the south shore of Lake Ontario I did a 180 degree turn and lies about 15-20 south of Buffalo - still this bright object was off my right wing. My next move was a further separation. After passing Buffalo I decided I would determine if this was by imagination, a star or an object. I concluded that if this was a star by putting my aircraft directly at this object and climbing to the maximum altitude of the F-86D I would stall out with the object. So I climbed, climbing and climbing - it was always up and-ahead of me. But while I was climbing it appeared that I was getting closer. In range. The object definitely got brighter and finally at 32,000' I was level with the object-because at this point altitude, instead of looking up at it, I was looking down. I was running low on fuel - and called it quits. I seemed to be getting closer, then I notice a flashing red lite - intermittently flashing from this object. At this time I was 91 miles N-NW of home plate - all of a sudden it seemed to increase the gap between me and the object, at this time I was running low on fuel - and called it quits. I banked the A/C around behind me - then, all of a sudden it disappeared -I banked the A/C around and returned to my base, landing at 2230 est. At no time did I even get a radar contact with my radar equipment.

8. After interviewing the SOURCES and analyzing the responses, it became quite apparent that the sighting was not one of the following:

Airplane - It did not react like an airplane in its movements. It was too bright. No radar returns could be gained from it. The F-860 could not close on it. The configuration was circular.

Balloon - It could not be caught by an F-860. It remained approximately the same size, regardless of position of F-860. No returns on the radar scopes. It was too bright. It remained in the same location too long.

A line is too faint to read clearly.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-D, 4602D AISS                   3D-UFOB-1-56                   PART FIVE                   PAGE    15    15

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object was probably the planet Venus for the following reasons:

a. Using the process of elimination, the object was no doubt not an airplane, balloon, or star, as explained in Part Four, par 8 of this report.

b. B. A. Manning and Lt. G. Dormer tend to support the possibility that the object could have been a glob of ionized gases, but it is also their opinion that such a theory would be very difficult to prove. The Venus hypothesis seemed more probable.

c. As stated by Dr. Fredrickson (Part Four, par. 10), Venus is the brightest object in the sky during this time of year. It would definitely be setting around 2200 - 2230 EST, during which time it would give off a red color similar to the setting sun. A pilot would certainly not be cognizant of any notable closure on the planet Venus due to its distance from the Earth - 50 million miles.

d. The object was observed by one (1) observer for four (4) hours. Venus can be seen for at least four (4) hours at night prior to setting. Partial setting, Venus would appear further away and decreased intensity. The object was seen in the West, which is the direction which Venus can always be seen this time of year.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
1. It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was definitely caused by the planet Venus. The following is given in support of the above hypothesis:

a. The planet Venus was located at the same position as the UFOB at the time of the sighting and was the brightest heavenly body in the sky.

b. The long duration of the sightings.

c. Failure of airborne radar as well as three (3) ground radar sets to pick up the object.

d. At the time of the attempted air intercept by Captain Solon, Venus was "setting" in the west and would have therefore appeared to be level with, or lower than, his aircraft. Captain [name illegible] heading while attempting to overtake the object was the approach at [illegible].

Education: Twelve (12) years, Accounting (extension course)
Qualifications: Accounting

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was mild mannered, and appeared to give much thought and consideration to questions of investigators. He attempted to give concise and pertinent details of the sighting. Mr. White is well liked and considered a responsible member of his community. Due to his mild mannered and responsible character, it is the investigator's opinion that information given by SOURCE was reliable to the best of his ability.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
1. SOURCE was working at Ben Otto Motors on the corner of Clark and McKinley Parkway, Hamburg, New York, (GMN 1042). He was called out on the street by a friend to observe a bright light glowing in the sky at 01/0100Z Mar 56.

2. The night was clear with scattered clouds and a slight breeze during the thirty minutes that SOURCE observed the object. Object seemed to swing with a pendulum motion due west from the observer's location. Object gave off an unusually brilliant white glow with northerly portion of object at greater intensity than the rest. Mr. White described the object as round except for a slight flatness on the bottom.

3. SOURCE heard no sound from the object. At times object did appear to stand still to him, but never suddenly accelerate in any direction. Glow of object seemed to change in intensity at various times during observation. However, the perimeter appeared to be fuzzy or blurred during entire observation.

4. Observation was made over a period of one and one-quarters hours, but was actually seen for only thirty minutes due to cloud obstructions at various times. Similar observations had been made by SOURCE during the past week.

Statement of Mr.

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

At approximately 8 PM Feb. 29, 1956 I was working at Ben Otto Motors, Clark & McKinley Pkwy Hamburg when the station attendant came out to observe a brilliant light in the sky to the west of us. I observed a large brilliant light in the western sky appearing to be out over Lake Erie or Canada. It appeared to slowly move in a pendulum fashion from North to South. Shortly a cloud obscured the object, and later perhaps 15 mins. I again saw it more to the NE towards Buffalo. I came home about 9:15 and it still was in the sky but appeared further away.

   Address: [redacted], Lackawanna 18, New York
   Age: 15
   Present Position: High School Student
   Education: Ten (10)
   Qualifications: GOC observer (1½ years)

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a serious minded youth who appeared very interested in the GOC program. SOURCE's ability to identify configurations of various aircraft seemed to be high in accordance with that required of GOC observers. SOURCE was very cooperative and made every attempt to give accurate information. Information given by him is considered to be fairly reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
    1. On 29/2350Z Feb 56, SOURCE was walking down South Shore Boulevard toward his home in Lackawanna, New York (GJN 0949) when he spotted a bright light in the sky. After observing the object for approximately five minutes, SOURCE brought his mother's attention to it. It was learned through SOURCE that a gas station attendant also observed the object.

    2. SOURCE stated that he observed one object for a period of three hours and forty minutes. SOURCE sighted a second object approximately twenty five to forty miles East of the first object. This object was sighted for approximately one hour during his observation of the first object.

    3. The first object gave off a bright white glow during the entire observation. The second object gave off a bright glow but also had a green halo around the perimeter. Both objects had a fuzzy outline to their appearance.

    4. During this observation of nearly four hours, SOURCE was in and out of his home, talked with his mother about objects, and phoned Buffalo Filter Center and reported this sighting.

    5. SOURCE has seen a similar type phenomenon during past week while carrying out his duties as GOC observer. SOURCE heard no sound from either object and stated that objects seemed to flicker, change intensity at times and although they did not accelerate to any appreciable speed, both objects did move South across the sky.
