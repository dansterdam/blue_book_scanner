AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Headquarters, 3902d AB Wg
Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska

REPORT NO. 2        PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

At 1015 CST, 25 September 1952, A/1C James O. Howell, AF1228465, Headquarters Squadron Division, Strategic Air Command, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska was departing a building coupled by main Supply Room. He noticed an aircraft in the immediate vicinity. Upon looking directly overhead he observed a small object, at a very high altitude, which appeared to be stationary. After a few moments objects moved in an Easterly direction and joined by a second object at a similar nature. Both moved off toward the East and disappeared. A few moments later one object reappeared proceeding in a Westerly direction.

A/1C Howell summoned S/Sgt Robert S. Lewis, AF37736757, same organization, and called his attention to the objects. Both Airmen observed objects for approximately five minutes after which one object climbed out of sight and was followed by the second.

The objects appeared round and were silver in color. Reflection was noted. Size appeared to be equal to that of "a quarter." An estimate of altitude not available other than statement of Airman - "at a very high altitude."

Movement of objects was at times stationary followed by West to East flight path.

Other aircraft noted were one (1) B-47 at high altitude, leaving vapor trails and one (1) F-84 at approximately 5000 feet.

This headquarters is unable to evaluate this report.

This image is a map of eastern Nebraska, centered around Omaha. The map includes various cities and towns such as Lincoln, Fremont, Council Bluffs, and others. There is a "DANGER AREA (D-20)" marked on the map. The map shows roads, railways, and other geographical features. At the bottom of the map, there is text indicating the scale is 1:1,000,000 and the map was printed in blue. The date of information is September 1952. The map appears to be part of an official document, likely related to air traffic control or military operations.
