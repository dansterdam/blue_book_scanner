Between the hours of 17:00 and 17:30 Central Standard Time, 22 February 1955, a saucer-like object was observed near Milan, Missouri. The day was clear, there was little wind, and the sun was shining brightly. 

The object was described as circular in shape, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and a light reddish-orange in color. It was observed to be spinning as it moved across the sky in a level flight at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately one minute as it passed over the observer's position.

No other witnesses were found in the immediate area. The object was observed to disappear from view behind some trees in the distance. No sound was heard during the observation.
