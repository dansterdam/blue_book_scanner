Memo, AFOIN-4B4g, 24 July 59 (U) Unidentified Objects South China Seas

1st Ind (AFOIN-4B1a/Capt. Keriakou/1cm/74201)                   26 August 1959

TO:    AFOIN-4B4g

1. Inspection of radar returns of the suspected UFO's on KD-2 film for mission PJ-056 reveal no unusual or distinguishing factors that would afford data for an analysis. Radar returns seem to be normal scope points.

2. However, as a comment on Report #1264291, the UFO's could possibly be:

    a. Submarine activity, to include a refueling operation.

    b. Chinese Fishing sampans off the China coast.

    c. Giant Manta Rays (known to exist up to 25-30 ft. in wing span), floating on top of the sea or swimming just below surface. Color of rays in base report correlate with this theory. How do rays reflect radar energy?
