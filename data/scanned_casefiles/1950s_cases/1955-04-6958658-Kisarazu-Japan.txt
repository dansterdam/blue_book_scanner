The document appears to be a meteorological or aviation report from Kisarazu, Japan, dated 30 April 1955, with various wind speed and cloud cover measurements.

The text on this page is largely illegible. I can make out some partial text at the top of the page that appears to say "S.Y. 58.12 APP JAPAN", but most of the document is too faint or blurry to read clearly.
