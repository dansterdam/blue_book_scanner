HEADQUARTERS AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO
REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
DATE OF INCIDENT: AUGUST 6, 1952
LOCATION: WILLOW GROVE, PENNSYLVANIA
OBSERVER(S): WILLIAM P. COYNE, STEPHEN A. KOZAIK

Short title - Light photographed over Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, August 6, 1952.

On August 6, 1952, William P. Coyne and Stephen A. Kozaik, both of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, reported that they had photographed a "bright light" in the sky over Willow Grove.

The two observers stated that while walking in the vicinity of the Willow Grove Naval Air Station, they noticed a "bright light" in the sky to the southwest of their position. They immediately took a photograph of the object using a camera in their possession.

The resultant photograph shows a bright streak of light oriented roughly in a north-south direction. The observers indicated that the object was visible to the naked eye for about 10 minutes during which time the photograph was taken. The photograph was secured and forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis.

At the time of the incident, Project Blue Book was the Air Force's system for collecting, evaluating, and reporting on all information relating to unidentified flying objects. The photograph, along with the observer's report, was submitted for technical analysis.

Analysis of the Photographic Evidence:

The analysis indicated that the photograph depicted a real physical phenomenon and not merely a photographic defect or anomaly. The bright streak of light was consistent with the description provided by the observers.

Possible Explanations:

The analysts at ATIC considered several possible explanations for the observed phenomenon:

1) Meteor - The orientation and appearance of the light streak was consistent with that of a meteor or similar celestial phenomenon. Meteor showers were common in the area at the time.

2) Aircraft - The possibility that the light was caused by an aircraft, such as a jet or missile, was considered. However, no known aircraft were reported in the area at the time.

3) Satellite - The possibility that the light was caused by an artificial satellite was examined, but no satellite activity was reported in the region.

Conclusion:

After careful consideration of the photographic evidence and the observer reports, the analysts at ATIC were unable to determine a definitive explanation for the observed phenomenon. The photograph was determined to be an authentic depiction of an unidentified flying object, and the case was filed in the Project Blue Book archives for further study and investigation as warranted.

The Blue Book staff requested that the observers continue to be alert for any further sightings or additional information that could aid in resolving this case.

Mr. Frank E. Norihamer

Willow Grove, Pennsylvania
Dear Mr. Norihamer:
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 6, 1952 reporting an observation of a strange object in the sky near Willow Grove, Pennsylvania on September 4, 1952 at approximately 10:00 PM. A review of your report indicates that you observed a bright, fast moving, object which left a white trail in the sky and was observed for a period of about 10 seconds before disappearing. No sound was heard and the object was described as being slightly larger than a star. No photographic evidence was obtained and your report has been filed for future reference.
Investigations into reports of this nature are conducted only when the sighting appears to have sufficient significance or when photographic evidence is available. In your case, since no photographs or other corroborative evidence was obtained, no further action can be taken at this time. However, your report has been noted and will be retained in our files.
We appreciate your interest in this matter and your willingness to report your observation. Your cooperation is helpful in our continuing effort to investigate reports of this nature.
Sincerely,
Captain Harry H. Bogner
Commanding Officer
