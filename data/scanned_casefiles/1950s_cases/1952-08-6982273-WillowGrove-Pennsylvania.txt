Text found in the image:

"five minute exposure"

The image appears to be a black and white photograph with several linear streaks or trails against a dark background, which seem to be star or light trails captured during a five-minute long camera exposure.

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely dark and low contrast, with only a few white/light lines visible against a black background. No legible text is discernible in this image. The document seems to be a very poorly scanned or reproduced page from a UFO report document.
