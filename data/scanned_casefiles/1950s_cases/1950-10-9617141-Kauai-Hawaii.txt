11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was observed as a luminous object cross the sky in a South to North direction, starting about 20 deg above the horizon and when last seen was about 20 deg above the horizon. When first observed the diameter of the object appeared to be one-quarter the diameter of the moon. When in its course it was about six-tenths the diameter of the moon, decreasing in size as it moved toward where it disappeared into above high cumulus clouds. The object was circular in shape, with indefinite edges, and glowed with a soft luminous white light. At first it was thought to be a shooting star-but this was discounted by the facts that a second to maintain a level flight at an even rate of speed. Too, the softness of the light was unlike the brilliancy of a falling star.

SUMMARY: (Enter under summary of report. Give significance in brief narrative paragraph. List inclosures in most brief. Refer to AF Form 112, Part II)

a. The following information concerning the sighting by source of an unidentified aerial object over the island of Kauai, T. H., at 1925L, 7 October 1950, was submitted by the Chief, Intelligence Division, Pacific Division, MATS, Hickam AFB, Oahu T. H.

"At 7:25 PM, local time, Saturday, October 7th, 1950, I observed a luminous object cross the sky in a south to north direction, starting about 20 degrees above the horizon in the direction of Anahola, last seen 30 degrees above the horizon in the direction of Anahola. When first observed the diameter of the object appeared to be one-quarter the diameter of the moon. When in its course it was above Kapaa it appeared to be sixteen the diameter of the moon, decreasing in size as it moved towards Anahola where it was last seen disappearing into or above cumulus clouds. The object was circular in shape, with indefinite edges, and glowed with a soft luminous white light. At first it was thought to be a shooting star-but this was discounted by the fact that it seemed to maintain a level flight, at an even rate of speed. Too, the softness of the light was unlike the brilliancy of a falling star."

b. Weather conditions prevailing at the time of the sighting were not reported.
