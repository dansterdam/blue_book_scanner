10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Radar sighting obj that moved in SE to NW erratically. Visual sighting of obj at 45 deg elev 130 deg azimuth not the same as the rptd radar track. Visual stationary. Radar track disappeared West. No duration given other than 1Â½ hrs. Positional info & other data on the Radar plots not furnished.

11. COMMENTS
A/C ruled out at source. Wind direction rules out balloon. No visual/appear real. No radar film taken. Visual position can be evaluated as Star by the principal witness on a subsequent check. Radar track not furnished, however duration of the sighting was listed as 1 hrs. No speed, no mention of flight formation given.

NOTE:
[Partially illegible handwritten text on left side of page]

ATIC Comment:

1) Heyman it appears shows UFO having blinking in steady lights 1.9 am for the aircraft. However, on traffic check back this out apparently.

2) There was another case and is in system almost 1/2 hour - some local displaced & would seem to indicate that the lights cleared with relatively - any near - moving to the west.

3) Navy, USAF w/ Charts (for high altitude tests) Flt. Nos. 35, and 161-70 definitely show 60-70 feet altitude are over the New foundland area. They got ground traced by both ADES + ECC Equipped.

4) Change below (this sign) are clearly the ground for some considerable distance (from the MSL) USGS 1068) distant mile.

5) Also possible for a shift of 6 [rest of text is illegible]

Brief - Newfoundland Sighting
25 February 1958

1. Upon review of all available data
it seems apparent that this case involves
a. Gross exaggeration for publicity purposes
b. Mistaken identification of conventional
sightings i.e. (1) Red Cuff noise
(2) Star, sun through
"cloud" atmosphere
"motion"

2. Cross-reference with no-par & 
spo-ofc sources involved:
1a. Mi. [redacted]
1b. Mi. [redacted]
1c. Flying officer

3. The three (3) signaled by some writing
apparently was not related, and
possibly in general the story.

4. However, there were four (4) radar
sightings plotted at the time of 1st
source report which remain unsubstantiated
further, whether or developments
place in "UNKNOWN" category etc.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Further questioning of Flying Officer [REDACTED] at [REDACTED] leading at [REDACTED] reveals that, in his opinion, this object was definitely a bright object which was sighted as being somewhat of a [REDACTED] and makes it evident that this sighting was also not the same object that was seen on an object approximately at 4000 feet.

Reported two different sightings, the first at 25/0452, and the second at 26/0452, and the position of both sightings was to the south of Glenwood in the vicinity of an operating Bowaters Wood Camp. It is not known as yet whether any activity at this camp at those times could have caused a glow in the sky and such effect. The clearing presumably found by [REDACTED] could have been a wood yard made by a bulldozer prior to the coverup. Bowaters has a tailboard in that area of the camp, but the officials did not know if it was such a clearing.

10 The existence of the clearing with freshly broken and uprooted trees was described by [REDACTED] who was attached to the search party. The last trace was unable to guide the ground party back to it due to his lack of knowledge of the area. His home is in Deer Lake, and he has been away from Newfoundland for several years. Although quite well known in Glenwood because of residence there, a small area near possible Wood Camp. Further ground search is not recommended because of the snow and bush conditions existing in the area. For these reasons, it is recommended that a low-level search using an L-20 or a C-47 might disclose the position of the clearing, aerial photo could be taken if the clearing is located, and a study of such photos should give a reasonable explanation for the clearing.

11 Further, the fact the system had four unidentified places at a height of 2000 feet about the time of [REDACTED] sighting adds weight to his report. Until these points are critically identified, it may be assumed that Johnson saw an object that could be an unidentified flying object.

12 A copy, scale 1:50000, is included as App. and shows the route of the search party and the route traversed in the search to the clearing.

13 May the Detachment Commander be advised of any further information required by your command.
