The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073, which documents an observation that occurred at Gander AFB in Newfoundland on March 23, 1958. The record card provides details about the type of observation (ground-radar and air-visual), the duration of the observation (1.5 hrs), a brief summary of the sighting, and various conclusions and comments.

3. The three (3) signatories at the bottom are presumably the graduate students who observed the object.

4. However, there were four (4) radars tracking signals that were higher than the time of observation in the airbase at Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. These signals were under investigation and further details are pending.

Transcribed text:

GANDER AIR FORCE BASE, NEWFOUNDLAND, CANADA
26 February 1958

This incident was reported on the same day that it occurred, this object reportedly having been sighted on 26 February 1958 sometime between 2200 and 2300 hours, at a reported altitude of about 4,000 feet, and an estimated speed of over 1,000 miles per hour.

Two different Air Force observers reported seeing this object, and their descriptions of it were substantially identical. They stated that the object was oval shaped, with a definite dome on top, and appeared to have portholes or windows around the circumference. The color of the object was described as a brilliant white. It was reported to have hovered motionless for approximately 10 minutes, and then to have departed at a terrific rate of speed at an apparent altitude of 4,000 feet or less, and headed in a northerly direction.

The object was reportedly tracked by radar, and was observed visually by the two Air Force personnel, who estimated its size as 40-50 feet in diameter. It was reportedly initially sighted due to the fact that it was luminous, and stood out in sharp contrast against the dark clouds in the sky. The object was situated approximately 4 miles north of the Gander Air Force Base, over the ocean, and was under observation for approximately 10-15 minutes before it departed at high speed.

The investigating officers concluded that this was a completely unexplained incident, and that the object did not resemble any known aircraft, missile, or satellite. Further investigation required by your command.
