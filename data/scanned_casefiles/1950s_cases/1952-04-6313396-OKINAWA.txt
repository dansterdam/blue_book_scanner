COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
           Information on combat crew observations submitted herewith is evaluated as B-2,
           The one factor affecting the significance of said information is the limited number
           of actual encounters with the enemy. All comments and conclusions are based on
           mariations and comments are based on actual combat and training experience.
