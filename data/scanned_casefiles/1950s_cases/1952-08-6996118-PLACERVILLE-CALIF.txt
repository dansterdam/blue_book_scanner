Two unidentified objects were observed visually at 2020 Pacific Daylight Time [3 August 1952] for a period of 7 minutes. Nothing was reported on the objects except that they were bright and at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet and apparently 15 - 20 miles from the observer. The second object appeared to join the first object.

The weather officer reports visibility of 20 miles and winds at 10,000 feet were 150° at 10 knots; at 20,000 feet winds were 210° at 23 knots.

The text on this page is largely illegible due to poor image quality and scanning. I can make out some partial text and headers on the right side of the document, but most of the text is too blurry or faded to read with confidence. The document appears to have hole punches on the left side and seems to be part of an official report or file, but the specific details cannot be discerned from this image.
