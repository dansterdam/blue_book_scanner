The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report from Project Blue Book, dated January 11, 1953, regarding an unidentified flying object sighted near Gadsden, Alabama.

The text in the document is as follows:

AT 17056, 11 January 1953, an unidentified flying object was sighted by a civilian pilot near the town of Gadsden, Alabama. The witnesses were the Civilian Air Defense Director and the Manager of the Gadsden Municipal Airport. According to their report, the object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. It appeared to be round or oval in shape, and was estimated to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object was observed to make a rapid climb and then level off, and it emitted a bright light which illuminated the area. The object was observed through a small pair of binoculars through which the observer viewed the object. The object displayed a metallic or aluminum-like surface which reflected the rays of the sun. It appeared to be surrounded by a vapor trail and was described as moving at a high rate of speed. The weather was clear, visibility was good, and there was no air traffic in the location at the time. No physical evidence (photographs, etc.) was obtained.
