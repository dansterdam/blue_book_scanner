The image appears to be a record card from Project 10073, but it does not contain any photograph. The text on the card is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: November 6, 1957
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1122
3. LOCATION: LAREDO AFB, TEXAS
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-radar
5. DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS OBSERVED: 1 bright track
6. SOURCE: Radar
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-10 minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: East
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: An object was observed on the ground-radar scope of the ADCC at Laredo AFB, Texas. It was a single bright track that appeared on the scope and remained there for 5 to 10 minutes. The object was moving in an easterly direction at an undetermined speed. No visual sighting was made.
11. COMMENTS: It is difficult to understand how an object on a ground-radar scope could be considered unidentified. The observation should have been reported as a probable aircraft of some kind, or at least identified as a track on the radar scope. The classification of "unidentified" appears to be an over-reaction based on the information provided.
