Both Myself And Mr. [redacted] Were Keeping
a Close Watch on The Balloon. I Observed First Two Objects
in Formation. Very Quickly They Were Joined By Four
Others. The Five Objects Were Observed To Join Formation
in Trail Behind the Leader. They Appeared Very Quickly
And Joined This Trail Formation. While in Formation They
Were Spread Very Evenly. When I Saw Three of The
Objects I Asked Mr. [redacted] What He Could See.
He Said Exactly What I Did. [illegible] While He Was Watching
I Took Pictures With A 16MM Bolex With A 6" Telephoto
Lens. As I Was Taking Pictures The Objects Moved
Slowly Under The Balloon And To A Side Direction. Very
Suddenly The Objects Seemed To Go Straight Up At
Right Angles To Them Level Flight Position. They
Remained in Perfect Trail Formation And Seemed To
"Reel" or "Break" Straight Up At Terrible Speed And
Disappear.

In My Opinion These Were NOT Reflections From
The Aircraft Wind Shield 1952 Were They Reflections From
The Balloon. The Sky Was A Blue Deep Blue And The

2 North Mianus
School Boys Tell
Of Seeing 'Saucer'

The story of two North Mianus
school pupils who swear they saw
a "flying saucer" was revealed by
the witnesses yesterday.

The sworn witnesses are Waldo
Morrell, 11, of Valley Rd., and his
neighbor and pal, Roy Mohler.
Waldo came flying into the house
and told his mother, scared and
white as a sheet.

"I know he saw something,"
said his mother. "He told me he
wouldn't make up stories."

Waldo said, pointing out the
flying saucer over the house, "I
know he saw something, something
wouldn't show go up to
the house." His mother, Mrs.
Morrell, said, "I believe him."

Roy and Waldo came down
from the tree where they had
been playing when they said they
saw the saucer. Roy said the
saucer was a "balloon with a light
shining from inside." It was near
a living room, he explained.

"It looked just like the color the
sun does now," Roy said, pointing
to yesterday's setting sun at 5:15
p.m. It glowed from inside.

When could he distinguish out-
line of the saucer? "Oh, he added
with a laugh, "just before it

(Continued from Page 1)

looked. It must have been a couple
of thousand feet high like clouds."
Roy reported.

Waldo said the saucer did not
shine on the ice or cause any
shadow.

The two boys said they watched
the saucer for about three minutes,
getting closer and closer. They
said, "That's why they believe it
was fairly high."

Then they said: "Waldo threw off his loose skate,
put his shoe back on, and
scrambled home."

"I set a new world's record when
I ran to the house," Waldo admits.

Roy stopped skating as he searched the area but found no
other trace of the saucer and got
both boys excited as they talked
and swore as they sat in the front
room.

Waldo's parents told him, "If
you believe it, John, know the
saucer, don't change your mind
because people did not." They said
the folks sitting in the Morrell's
living room yesterday said they
are sure they two boys saw a flying
saucer. Most agreed that saucers
are not come from Mars.

It's probably the Army or Navy
testing some radio-controlled device, Mr. and Mrs. Morrell think.

They had watched a television
story on flying saucers during
which was mentioned the theory
that the armed forces are the actual source of the strange sightings.
