Venus, Saturn Now Seen
Although the giant planet Saturn is becoming increasingly prominent in the evening 
sky, it is still retiring early from view. September will have a total eclipse of the 
sun, which will also attract much attention.

By JAMES STOKLEY

The planet Saturn, which is gradually becoming more prominent in the evening sky at 
this time of year, will be nearing the point of its greatest brilliancy late in September.

Saturn, known as the ringed planet because it is surrounded by a remarkable system of 
rings, is now readily visible in the evening sky. It is the most distant of the major 
planets which can be seen with the unaided eye, and at its brightest it ranks with the 
first magnitude stars.

At present, Saturn is rising in the east a few hours after sunset. It will be high in the 
southern sky during the middle of the night, and will set in the west shortly before 
sunrise.

The rings of Saturn, which give the planet its distinctive appearance, are now tilted 
some 26 degrees toward the earth. This angle will increase to 27 degrees by the 
time of Saturn's greatest brilliancy in late September.

September's Brightest Star

The planet Venus, which is now the morning star, will become the evening star in 
September, when it will be in its brightest phase of the year. At that time, it will be 
so brilliant that it will cast distinct shadows, and will be visible even in the daytime. 
This is true at the time of a new moon; at other times the moon's light will make 
Venus less conspicuous.

There are several other bright objects in the evening sky at this time, among them 
Jupiter and Arcturus. But the most brilliant of all will be Venus, shining with a steady 
light that can be easily recognized even by the casual observer.

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The page includes a star chart diagram labeled "symbols for stars in order of brightness" and a text section titled "Early Stars Were Brighter" that discusses how the brightness of stars has diminished over time.

Text extracted from the document:

Early Stars Were Brighter
A study of the atmospheres of the 8 stars leads astronomers to the conclusion that billions of years ago the stars were much brighter than they now are.
Test skies, there are several such signs, with much less brilliant stars than a few million years ago, are given by Dr. Ernest H. Walters and Dr. van Allen, both of the University of Utah. Their evidence convinces them that:
1. After billions of years, the brightness or apparent light output of the stars had diminished, so that the stars appear relatively much fainter now than they originally were when they were first formed.
2. The stars are believed, from various lines of evidence, to be about 5 billion years old. During the early life of the stars, they were producing large amounts of nuclear energy which manifested itself in greater brightness.
3. During the latter part of a star's lifetime, when the internal nuclear energy sources run low, the brightness of the star tends to diminish.
4. A study of the star Arcturus lll, which is about 30 million years old, shows that the brightness of Arcturus has diminished by about 7 percent in the last few billion years.
Astronomers have long held the general idea of stellar evolution, which includes the process of change in the appearance and characteristics of stars through the ages. The present study helps quantify this general idea and indicates that the stars were much more brilliant billions of years ago than they are now.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 99--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Sending a letter with photographs of the fragments to Colonel
Henning, the Chief of the Special Projects Branch of the Office of Information, United States
Air Force, she simultaneously released to the press copies of both
letters and photographs, and suggested that the Air Force could
publicize and analyze the material.
The photographs showed one fragment about four inches long and two inches
wide resembling petrified wood in appearance, and a smaller piece
shaped roughly like a flattened cupcake, whose surface showed
that and which was like that of an irregular chunk of a gray, very
fine-grained rock.
The Air Force photographed the material, and the Information Office in
Washington, Mrs. Lorenzen, through the newspaper amplified her challenge. If
the Air Force wanted to examine the mysterious fragments, she
said, they would have to comply with conditions [see]:
(1) APRO officers, together with duly appointed Air Force
liaison personnel, would establish a board of experts representing
both military and civilian UFO researchers.
(2) This board of experts would decide what meaningful tests
to perform to analyze the fragments in question.
(3) The board then would select a qualified testing agency to
perform the required tests under the supervision of the
board. The board would assure that the United States Air Force can supply have
received no more extraordinary proposition. Whatever it may have
felt, Colonel Tucker merely suggested that Mrs. Lorenzen could
submit the material to ATIC for analysis.
The fragments were examined by the Air Force.
In early in September 1952, a group of fishermen on a beach near
Ubatuba, Brazil—The UFO had suddenly drifted a disk-shaped object
downward and exploded, showering down fragments and sparks like
burning magnesium. The debris had been collected by a Brazilian expedition. Tests
including spectrographic and X-ray diffraction analyses showed
that the fragments had a composition like pure magnesium. Although they
evidently showed the presence of at least three elements common
of earth-magnesium, hydrogen, and oxygen—the analysis confirmed that
the magnesium fragments to their original. shape have consisted of
pure magnesium and that the hydroxide must have formed when
the fragments came in contact with the water. The final conclusion started
that the fragments were "pure magnesium, which is not within the technology of our times." [sic]
Similarly, psychical material, a cook might assert that since chocolate fudge
consists, at least in part, of 100 per cent sugar, some must criticize
that a cook's composition entirely of pure sugar, except for a little
coloring and milk, it picked up in passing through the kitchen. 
From the few facts available, a positive identification of the fragments is impossible. The description of the object seen by the fishermen
suggests it was near the end of its
flight. In the photographs the fragments took like a dolomite, a
variety of limestone. There is no evidence to suggest that an exploding meteor. 
v) There is no evidence to suggest that the fishermen's "wrecked
spacecraft" was anything but an exploding meteor.

Other Mysterious Fragments

In the spring of 1950 Mrs. Coral Lorenzen, director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, publicly challenged the Air Force statement that "physically concrete evidence" of flying saucers has never even a minute fragment of so-called "flying saucer" has ever been found.  [sic] Mrs. Lorenzen announced that she had in her possession the remains of a disc-shaped object that had met with disaster in the earth's atmosphere.  Without specifying the date and location of the event, the identity of the witnesses, or any corroborative details of the alleged disaster, she merely said that several persons had witnessed the catastrophe.  She went on to assert, somewhat astonishingly, that "the gratifying aspect of this case, however, is that we do not have to depend on the testimony of witnesses to establish the reality of the incident for the most startling physical evidence has been produced through the application of any known forensic techniques."

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
10 September 1957
PLEASANT VALLEY, NEW YORK

I. Plane Spotter Sees Circling Objects Drop "Flimsy Material"

This sighting took place on Tuesday, Sept. 10, in Pleasant Valley, N.Y. (on the upper Delaware River). A local plane spotter, a self-employed builder, saw three objects circling silently in a clear sky, "near military planes". The objects appeared to be of human size and were non-rigid or filmy. He tried to judge how far up they were, but they were certainly not high-flying jets. It looked to me as though they were flirting faster than any jet I ever saw--at least 2000 miles per hour.

What makes this observation noteworthy is that "he reported also that strings of shiny material dropped from the mystery craft and drifted southward." (Source: Danbury (Conn.) News-Times, Sept. 13, 1957.)
