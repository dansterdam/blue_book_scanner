Sci. ence News Letter for November 25, 1957

Venus Is Christmas Star
A crescent moon and the planet Venus will be close together on December 24, making a brilliant pair that lights the Christmas sky.

By JAMES STOKLEY

> This year we will have a real Christmas star. The planet Venus, which has been increasing in prominence during the autumn, will be at its greatest brilliance on Dec. 23.

After the sky gets dark, around this date, Venus will be blazing in the southwest, until it follows the sun below the horizon, more than three hours later. But even this will not be the full extent of the display. On the 24th, the moon, in a crescent phase, will pass three days after the new moon, will just to the north of Venus. While the closest approach comes, for Americans, during daylight hours, they will still be close together that evening, Christmas eve, and will form a striking backdrop for the carolers singing their Yuletide greetings.

Venus is the only planet that can be seen well on December evenings. On the seventh, Mercury is farthest east of the sun, will remain briefly in the southwesterly sky after the sun has set. Possibly, if you have a very clear view in that direction, and look closely, you can get a glimpse of this innermost of all the planets, but this is not really a favorable time to see Mercury.

No planets appear on the accompanying maps of the December evening sky. These show their appearance later in the evening, after Venus has set. The map is drawn for about 10:00 p.m., your own local kind of standard time, on Dec. 1, and an hour earlier at the middle of the month.

In the southeast where is now visible the brilliant array of stars which make the skies of the winter evening so beautiful.

with Aldebaran as the brightest star; distinctly red in hue, it is easy to identify. To the left of Taurus is Auriga, the charioteer, with the star Capella, another of the first magnitude.

Descending from Capella, we come to Castor and Pollux, of which the latter is the brighter. And between Gemini and Canis Major stands Canis Minor, the lesser dog, with Procyon as the brightest star.

Over toward the southwest are found the remnants of the constellations of the autumn evenings. Near the horizon, as shown on the maps, or higher if it is earlier in the evening, is Vega, about all that is seen of Lyra, the Vega. Above and to the left is Cygnus, the swan, with Deneb. While Vega and Deneb are first magnitude stars, their low altitude makes them look fainter.

About 3:30 a. m., at the beginning of December, and 1:30 a. m., at the end, another planet, Jupiter, appears in the southeast, in Virgo, the virgin. Its brightness now is just about the same as that of Sirius. Mars, of the second magnitude.

Crescent Venus

It will not be quite as thin a crescent as that of the moon, but more like the moon some two days later, or about five days after it is new.

The reason for the lunar phases is found in the fact that, as the moon revolves around the earth, it presents to our view varying amounts of its illuminated hemisphere.

At new, it is practically between the sun and us; the sunlit half is entirely turned away and we see nothing. But a few days later, as the moon swings eastward from the direction of the sun, it remains in the western sky for a while after the sun has set. A narrow sliver of the bright half then appears to us, as a crescent. Then, as it swings still farther away from the sun, half, three-quarters, and finally all, of the sunlit side is presented to us, bringing the full moon.

This takes about two weeks. During the next two weeks the changes occur in reverse order, and the moon is new once again. Something similar happens to Venus.

                            RECENT NEWS STORIES

    SAUCER WITH HIEROGLYPHICS FOUND IN ENGLAND (See photo on cover)

    This story is a bit out of date, but it should be new to most of our American
    readers. In December of last year, three men found a small flying saucer with
    strange writing on it on a moor near Yorkshire, England. The men were driving
    up a steep hill on the moor one night, when the engine of their car suddenly
    cut out. According to their report to the newspapers, they then saw a glowing
    object in the sky above some nearby trees. The object appeared to fall to the
    ground. One of the men, named Hutton, then took a flashlight and went out to
    locate it. And having done so, he returned to the car to tell his friends. On
    the way back to the car, he passed a man and woman on a little-used path. When
    he returned to the spot on the moor where he had located the object a few minutes before, it was no longer there. It subsequently developed that this other
    man, who is not identified by name in the papers, had picked up the mysterious
    object, and Hutton and his friends eventually bought it from him for $25. They
    then sent it to another unnamed man whom they believed to be an authority on
    flying saucers.

    The base of this mysterious saucer-shaped object is made of copper, with
    its metal coating about 5/16th of an inch thick. It has two vent holes in the top, with scorch marks around them. A shaft runs through the middle, and with a flashlight it is possible to look into the interior. Therein is found some copper tubing about a quarter of an inch in diameter coiled around a metal cylinder. Also inside is a powdery substance of some kind. The object is strongly made, and if it is a mere hoax, it must have cost the hoaxer a fairly large amount of money to construct it.

    There are hieroglyphics on the outside of the saucer, and when the object was taken apart, 17 thin copper sheets similar to tin foil in texture were found inside it in the form of a book. The above-mentioned flying saucer authority claims to have translated the outside message as follows: "Friends. Message inside to be dealt with by philosophers, not officials. Good wishes. Up." The inside message, written on those 17 copper sheets, begins and follows: "My name is Ulo, and I write this message to you, my friends on the planet of the sun you call earth. Where I live I will not say. You are a fierce race, and prepare for space travel...." The man who made this translation was quoted as saying, "I accept that it comes from another planet. I think it was devised as a method of presenting certain ideas to the public - either by way of propaganda or advice. It may have come from a body of scientists, who, if they tried to put over their message in a normal way, might be guilty of a breach of trust." We of SAUCER NEWS are inclined to agree in general with this interpretation, assuming that the saucer is not an outright hoax after all.

Science News Letter for November 23, 1957

Like the moon, it has no light of its own
but is illuminated by the sun, so that one
half is bright and the opposite half dark.
Last April 14 it was out beyond the sun,
with the entire bright hemisphere turned
earthwards. Since then it has been moving
and is now coming between the earth and
sun. Thus, most of its sunlit hemisphere is
turned away, and we have a crescent phase.

On Jan. 28 it will be, nearly, directly
between us and the sun, and this will
correspond to new moon. After that it will
become a crescent again, visible in the
morning sky before sunrise.

Unlike the moon, Venus is always so
far away that only through a telescope are
its phases visible.

The phases of Venus differ from those of
the moon in another respect.

As the moon travels around the earth, its
distance does not change very greatly, only
from about 221,000 miles to 253,000 miles.
Thus there is no great change in its apparent size, and the diameter of the full
moon is about the same as when it is in a
narrow crescent phase. But when Venus is
full it is out far beyond the sun, about
160,000,000 miles away. Just before Christmas it will be less than 40,000,000 miles
away, and on Jan. 28 its distance will be
about 26,900,000 miles. Thus, as it gets
near the "new" phase, it is much larger,
seemingly, in the sky.

That is why it is brightest when a crescent. Although less than half of the bright
side is visible to us, its proximity more
than makes up for this, and the part we
can see fills the largest area of the sky.
Then it is at the greatest brilliance.

Winter Arrives

On Dec. 21 the sun, which has apparently
been traveling southward in the sky since
last June, reaches its southernmost point.
This is the winter solstice—the beginning
of winter in the Northern Hemisphere—and
it occurs at 9:19 p. m. EST.

At that moment the sun will be directly
over a point near the eastern edge of the
Aruna Desert, which is in Australia, on
the border between Queensland and the
Northern Territory. In Australia, and other
southern countries, the sun will be high
in the sky, marking summer's beginning.
