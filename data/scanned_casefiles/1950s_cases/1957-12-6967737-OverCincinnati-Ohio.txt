ASTRONOMY
Venus Is Christmas Star
A crescent moon and the planet Venus will be close to-gether on December 24, making a brilliant pair that lights the Christmas sky.
By JAMES STOKLEY
This year we will have a real Christmas star. The planet Venus, which has been increasing in brilliance during the unturning nights, will reach its greatest splendor just before the holidays.
After the sky gets dark, around this date, Venus will be shining in the southwest, three and a half times brighter than Sirius, the brightest star. Three days after the new moon, Venus will be even closer to the moon, and on Christmas Eve, when the crescent moon is standing nearly, you'll see Venus through a crescent phase. 
Venus, still well up after sunset, will not be quite as much in the southwest as at first, but will have shifted a little toward the west. The reason for the lunar phases is found in the fact that, as the moon revolves around the Earth, we get different portions of its illuminated hemisphere.
At sunset, it is usually between the sun and ourselves, and we see nothing. But a few days later, as the moon's phases advance from new to first quarter, we get a crescent shape, with more and more of the bright half being visible each evening.
Venus will be highest in the southwestern sky for a while after sunset, but as the night goes on, it will shift farther toward the west, and eventually set a couple of hours before the sun.
This takes about two weeks. During the next two weeks, the changes occur in reverse order as the moon wanes from full to new again. Something similar happens to Venus.

RECENT NEWS STORIES
This story is a bit one of old date, but it seems to meet some of our American readers: In December of last year, three men found a small flying saucer with hieroglyphics around it on a moor near Yorkshire, England. The men were driving up a steep hill on the road one night, when the engines of their car suddenly died out. According to their report, they then saw a flying saucer the size of a small automobile hovering about 3 feet off the ground. One of the men, named Hutton, then took a flashlight and went out to examine the object. He maintained the object was 17 feet in diameter and was made of a material like copper, silvery grey in color. There were hieroglyphics on the outside. Hutton and his friends examined the object for several minutes. On the way back to the car, he claimed to have met a man and a woman on a little-used path. When he returned to the spot, the object and the two figures had disappeared. Another man, who is not identified by name in the papers, had picked up the mysterious object, and Hutton and his friends eventually report it from him for $25. They then lent it to another unnamed man whom they believed to be an authority on flying saucers.

The case of this mysterious saucer-shaped 25-foot object is made of copper, about two inches thick. According to this report made public on 17 December 1957, the object had a light shining through the middle, and with a flashlight it is possible to look into the interior. The object is found to contain some copper tubing and with a flashlight it is possible to see a quarter-inch in diameter metal cylinder. Also inside is a powdery substance of some kind. The object has a strongly made and it is more than a mere hoax. It must have considerable purpose.

There are hieroglyphics on the outside of the saucer, and when the object was opened it was in the form of a book. The above-mentioned flying saucer measures 17 feet in diameter, and the witnesses described the object as silvery grey in color. Friendly messages inside to be dealt with by philosophers, not by officials, God shows this. UFO inside is massive, and larger than this one which is described... It must come the sun you call earthly. Wherever I live, I will not say. You see a fierce face, another planet. I think it was derived or presenting certain ideas which at the moment we cannot give you more about. The body of scientists, they say, are trying to put over their message in a way, might be guilty of a breach of trust. We of SAUCER NEWS are inclined to agree in general with this interpretation, assuming that the saucer is not an outright hoax after all.

Science News Letter for November 23, 1957

Like the moon, it has no light of its own but shines by reflected sunlight. That is why it is brightest when a crescent. Although less than half of the bright side is visible, the part we see is fully illumined and so makes up for this, and the part we cannot see is the largest and most brilliant.

Winter Arrives

On Dec. 21 comes the winter solstice, which has apparently been discovered in all civilized lands since very remote antiquity. It is the date when the sun reaches its farthest point south of the equator, and marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

Celestial Time Table for December
Dec. EST
3 6:10p.m. Algol (variable star in Perseus) at minimum brightness.
7 10:50p.m. Jupiter stationary.
8 10:00p.m. Saturn on far side of sun, this time at maximum brilliance.
13 early a.m. Geminids meteor shower.
midnight Moon, Saturn, stars, distance 252,500 miles.
14 12:14a.m. Moon in last quarter.
16 12:27p.m. Moon passes further.
18 4:31a.m. Moon at minimum.
20 11:04p.m. Algol at minimum.
21 6:42p.m. Winter solstice in North Hemisphere.
23 7:53p.m. Venus at greatest brilliance.
24 1:27p.m. Moon passes Venus.
