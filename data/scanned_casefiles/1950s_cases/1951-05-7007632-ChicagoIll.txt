SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

At approximately 1950 hours, 24 May 1951, Mr. [redacted], Portage Park, Chicago, Illinois, and his uncle Mr. [redacted] observed an unusual flying object which appeared to be a cigar-shaped rocket flying at approximately 50,000 feet. The sky was clear, and visibility was perfect. The rocket had an exhaust of flame which was about a mile long. The front of the rocket had a light which blinked off and on, much like a flashlight sending Morse code. The rocket flew in an easterly direction for approximately 12-15 minutes. It then changed to a northerly course, finally turning west and disappearing from sight. Mr. [redacted] a neighbor of [redacted] and several other neighbors all watched flight of the rocket for approximately thirty minutes.

[redacted] notified became of this rocket because he assumed that it had been seen by many people. He saw no notice of such a spectacle in the daily papers and finally called the HERALD AMERICAN on 25 May to see if they could give some explanation of the flight. The HERALD AMERICAN stated that they had no information of any such activity and advised [redacted] to call Fifth Army Intelligence. [redacted] is a 1st Lt. in the Army Reserve.

Other Winged UFOs

During the era of the saucers, winged creatures were responsible for many UFO stories. But winged creatures do not stay put, and in flying away they usually take with them the evidence that the alleged spaceships were actually only birds or insects.

One such incident occurred at Downey, California, on May 29, 1951. Late in the afternoon three technical writers for North American Aviation were standing outdoors chatting and looking at the sky when suddenly they noticed about thirty glowing, meteorlike objects moving in the east, about 45 degrees above the horizon. They made no sound and left no trail. Emitting an intense electric-blue light, the objects made fantastic right-angled turns and swept across the sky in an undulating vertical formation, apparently covering about 90 degrees of sky in about 25 seconds. The diameters of the objects were estimated at 30 feet and the speed at 1700 miles an hour [1.1].

Many persons concluded that the unknowns must be interplanetary in origin because, as Life magazine commented, no natural object hurling at such a speed could execute a right-angled turn, and no known machine could fly so fast without making a sound or leaving a trail. No one could quarrel with this statement, but it has no obvious relation to the incident in question. Technical writers are not necessarily trained observers, and these witnesses had no way to make a reliable estimate of the height of the objects.

Without an accurate estimate of at least one quantity—true altitude, true size, or true speed—the others are meaningless. The unknowns were probably birds, but they could equally well have been butterflies, bits of paper, or merely ashes blowing over the two-story building.
