11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Objects, 25-40' long and 18-25' thick with appearance of two soup bowls put together, was first observed to be traveling relatively slow, then began to climb at a high rate of speed. Sources stated that object was near then at a low altitude. Object appeared to have several lighted windows in the side. Sped estimated at 2,600 mph. (It is felt that the observers sighted an object unidentified to them, probably a known object or phenomenon, which has been exaggerated in their minds.)

I.   Description of Incident

At 0400 & three sources observed an aerial object 25 to 40 feet long, and
12 to 25 foot thick with the appearance of two soup bowls put together. Three
were several lighted windows with what appeared to be a porthole on the side.
The object moved slowly at first, then began a rapid climb. The manner of dis-
appearance was unexpected. The object first appeared at 200 to 300 yards
distance from the observers at an altitude of 10 to 15 feet.

II.  Discussion of Incident

An investigation of the sources revealed that they are mature, reliable
and, at least in one case, relatively experienced persons.

III. Conclusion

This is to certify that I, [redacted], in company with [redacted], on the night of January 1, 1953, at approximately 2045, sighted an object which to the best of my knowledge was a flying saucer. I was driving my car ten miles south of Cascade, near the Missouri River, on Highway 91 when I saw this object. When I first saw the object I estimate that it was five miles away, and in one such position at me, and when it was 100 to 200 feet over the river and directly opposite me, it started to climb rapidly, staying in a horizontal position at all times. It continued to climb until out of sight.

The closest the object came to me was about 100 yards away, and approximately 50 to 100 feet above the river. The object was silver in color, shaped as a saucer, and had a red glow from the bottom. The weather conditions were clear, a bright moonlight night, with a slight wind.

The object appeared from the south-west and headed towards the north-west when out of sight. I estimate that I saw the object when it was five miles in front of me, and kept it in sight until it was five miles away from me. I certinue that I was in my sight for approximately ten seconds, therefore I estimate the speed at 3600 miles per hour.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 5th day of Jan 1953.

This is to certify that I, [redacted], in company with [redacted] on the night of January 1, 1953, at approximately 2045, sighted an object which to the best of my knowledge was a flying saucer. I was sliding in Varner Anderson's car ten miles south of Cascade, near the Missouri River, on Highway 91 when I saw this object. When I first saw the object, I estimate that it was five miles away, and it came right at me, and when it was 100 to 200 feet over the river and directly opposite me, it started to climb rapidly, staying in a horizontal position at all times.

The object appeared from the south-west and headed towards the north-west, when out of sight. I estimate that I saw the object when it was five miles in front of me, and kept it in sight until it was two miles away from me. I estimate that it was in my sight for approximately ten seconds, therefore I estimate the speed at 3600 miles per hour.
