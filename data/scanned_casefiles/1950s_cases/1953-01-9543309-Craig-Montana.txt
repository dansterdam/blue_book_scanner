Here is the text from the document:

AFFIDAVIT

This is to certify that on the night of January 9, 1953, at approximately 7:30 p.m. I observed an object in the sky which to the best of my knowledge was a flying saucer. I was driving my car about ten miles south of Glasgow, Montana, when I first observed the object. It was five to ten miles away, and it came right at me, and when it was 100 to 200 feet over the car and directly overhead, it flashed a bright light and then seemed to climb until out of sight.  

The object that I saw was about 100 yards away, and approximately 50 to 100 feet above the trees. The object was silver in color, shaped like a saucer, and had a slight red glow on the bottom, but no visible lights.  

This object appeared from the south-east and headed towards the north-west when out of sight. I estimate that it was in sight for approximately ten seconds, therefore I estimate the speed at 5600 miles per hour.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 25th day of June, 1953.

The image contains an affidavit from a witness who describes observing a flying saucer on January 9, 1953 near Craig, Montana. The document includes a detailed description of the sighting, including the size, shape, and movement of the object. The witness estimated the object was between 50 to 100 feet above the ground and traveled at a high rate of speed. The document is classified as "UNCLASSIFIED" and appears to be part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's official program to investigate unidentified flying objects.

Text transcribed from the document:

AFFIDAVIT

This is to certify that I, [redacted], of the right of free press do hereby swear that on the night of January 9, 1953, I saw an object which in my knowledge was a flying saucer. I was riding in Warrren Anderson's car between 7:30 and 8 pm. The object was in sight for about 15 to 20 seconds. It was five miles away, and it came right at us, and when it was too 500 feet over the top and directly opposite me, it started to climb at a tremendous speed. It continued to climb until out of sight. It was approximately 50 to 100 feet above the ground. The object was silver in color with a bright light from the bottom.

The weather conditions were clear, a bright moonlight night, with a slight wind.

The object appeared from the south-east and headed towards the north-west. It was in sight for approximately 15 to 20 seconds. I estimate that it was in my sight for approximately 5 miles away from me. I estimate that it was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, therefore I estimate the speed at 3600 miles per hour.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 7 day of January, 1953.

UNCLASSIFED 
This is to certify that an unidentified flying object was sighted in company of
'25 at approximately 2020 hours, MST, 9 Jan 1953 at Hilger, Montana.  The object vas sighted by me and, to the best of my knowledge, it was a flying saucer.  I was piloting a Farrier Anderson's air borne utility, in line of custom, and when I could not identify the object through normal means or it could not be continued tracked, I reported it immediately to my home base in Great Falls, Montana.

The object was about 100 yards away, and it came at me, and when it was approximately 100 to 150 feet away from me, the object stoped, hovered motionless, and then took off again to the northeast.  When out of sight, I estimate that I saw the object when it was five miles away, and it came to within approximately ten seconds, therefore I estimate the speed at 5000 miles per hour.
