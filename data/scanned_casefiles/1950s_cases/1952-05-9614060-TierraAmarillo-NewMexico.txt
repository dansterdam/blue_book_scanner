radar sighting report

1. It is not doubted that the radar reconnaissance operations saw this described* (on gets on the radar scan).

2. Explanation of these lights is very difficult. It, however, the just what the flying sighted towards (the) distinctly station
indicates at least two plausible explanations:

a. Targets caused by irregular pulse types from another equipment type
like Terrain equipment (possibly) at the same frequency am-
-the detecting station.

TO: 34th AD(D) Attention: Director Of Intelligence

At 1505 on the 29th of May 1952 while on duty as scope operator on scope No. 2; I detected what appeared to be an artillery target. Upon detection of the target I allowed one more sweep to determine it's direction and estimated speed to be sure it was a target. The original detection of this target was at 145 Deg. at 61 miles. However, on the following sweep the target had faded. I continued surveillance of this area and on the third sweep I detected a blip at 145 Deg. at 51 miles. Again I allowed others sweep to determine sure course of another target and again the target faded. On the following sweep what appeared to be the same target painted at 145 Deg. at 41 miles. At this time I noticed the general position of this position and excessive speed. The target was then plotted and the grid relayed to Offutt for further action. This was the last point detected on this target.

At 1650H on the 25 May 1952 I was on duty on scope operator at 145 Deg. at 61 miles. I started for the next sweep to check weather it was moving. In dial pad from on the next sweep. On the third sweep there was another point at 145 Deg. at 51 miles. I waited for another sweep to check if this was the same or another target. Nothing pointed this time but on the next sweep there was another point at 145 Deg. at 41 miles. At this time I notified the controller. This target did not paint again.
