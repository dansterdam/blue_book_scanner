Text extracted from the document:

Dear Mr. -----

This is to acknowledge your letter of 17 March and the questions concerning the identified flying object.

It must be assumed that the much publicized Washington "radar sighting" of 19 July 1952, is the case in question. This case was determined to be targets caused by a temperature inversion.

There is no record in the Air Force files of a sighting at Kirson AFB on 25 September 1952. (The Kinross case). The kilotons outlined in several books and articles as having been caused by an unidentified flying object. There is no case in the files which even closely parallels these circumstances.

The objects on the film taken at Tremonton, Utah on 2 July 1952, were determined to be birds, probably sea gulls.

The air force activities no concerning the photograph taken by Mr. --------- near Amarillo, Texas on 2 August 1956. Not knowing what radiation vapor is, it is the Air Force opinion that some explanation at the time speculated that the object was an irradiated vapor trail and was not a true photograph of the object itself.

The Air Force is not aware of any release date for the photograph taken by Mr. ----- The original was in the hands of the owner and he was free to do with it as he pleased.

The Air Force cannot confirm that the objects photographed by individuals were unidentified flying objects. It should be understood that the normal background for any area may constitute a few hundredths of a millirem/Giger, this is considered normal and constitutes no danger whatsoever.

The Air Force is not aware of any statement, official or otherwise, by a government agency to the effect that UFO's are space ships.

The Air Force has no specific knowledge of infrared tracking of unidentified flying objects.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from an old file or document related to Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The Air Force file contains no record of a report at Barber's Point, Pearl Harbor on 6 August 1953, and in fact, no report from Hawaii for the entire period of August 1953.

For the most part, information concerning UFO reports is available to the public, but due to the Air Force's opinion that the best answer is contained in the question, these opinions are not always fully explained. In certain instances, the file contains other information apart from the UFO portion, which may require clarification.

The Air Force is open-minded on the subject of space travel, and while they do not deny this possibility, they rather seek to state that data concerning sightings has been discovered to substantiate that UFOs are interplanetary or interstellar in origin.

No human exploration, telescopic or space probe, has revealed any additional information concerning UFOs.

1. At 1330 hours, 5 August 1956, Mr. Dallas, Texas, telephone reported the following information to the OSI Detachment Office, Hensley Field, Grand Prairie, Texas, concerning the sighting of unconventional type aircraft:

He advised that on 1 August 1956 as he was returning to Dallas, Texas, from Colorado Springs, Colorado, via Amarillo, Texas, he had departed Amarillo at approximately 0500 hours on Route 187 287. He observed that approximately ten (10) miles outside of Amarillo, he noted a bright green trajectory in the sky at about 10 o'clock. Shortly after he had landed just east of Dallas, he observed another similar phenomenon which originated to the north of Highway 287. Shortly after, he advised that this light appeared in a cloud formation, estimating its altitude to be approximately 10,000 to 20,000 feet. Further, that this cloud formation was approximately 50 miles in length from north to south and a lesser distance in width running east to west. Never did the phenomenon appear to descend below the level of the cloud base and moved intermittently within the cloud formation and on various occasions would move outside the extreme ends of the cloud running north to south. No sound was audible at any time during either the trajectory or the movement of the object itself.

There is a photograph present in the image, as mentioned in the text. The photograph is described as an "instant phenomenon" taken by a Kodak 620 Camera that was attached as an appendix to the report.

Hq 23d Dist OSI, Carswell AFB, Texas, file 24-0-229, Subject: Unidentifiable Flying Objects (UFOB)

The phenomenon appeared to be the size of a grapefruit and appeared in brilliance equal to the ignition of phosphorus, giving a brilliant beam of light both above and below the phenomenon itself, but never both beams simultaneously. At various times, a faint trace of red, varying its position on the phenomenon, was observed. The object appeared to be extremely variable, inasmuch as it appeared in intermittently by witnesses, and his wife between Amarillo and Memphis, Texas, on the indicated date. Amarillo at 0400 hours and again departed the second trajectory. According to information from the first trajectory, According to information from the first trajectory, At arrival at Memphis, Texas, the formation had begun to disintegrate. As daylight approached, the phenomenon appeared to be ascending into the heavens, where it was the approximate size of a star and no longer visible through the clouds, but since outside the cloud formation.

During the two (2) hours and fifteen (15) minutes that the phenomenon was observed, it was noted that as it moved to the open spaces within the cloud formation, its brilliance would illuminate these portions with the cloud structure. As it proceeded through the clouds to the opposite outer extremities, no illumination was visible within the cloud structure.

A World War II Bomber Pilot, who flew B-17 type aircraft, with the Eighth Air Force, advised that in his experience with weather conditions, etc., he had never observed anything comparable with this phenomenon.

A photograph of instant phenomenon taken by a Kodak 620 Camera is attached as an appendure. The documenter advised that he would retain the negative of the photograph taken. Further, that he would cooperate with the USAF authorities in any way possible.

2. The above information was furnished the Dallas Field Office, FBI, by on 2 August 1956.

MEMORANDUM FOR UFO FILES
SUBJECT: Late Receipt of UFO Reports

1. This batch of six (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover letter by the -46022 ATIC, who received them from the "46022 AIRS" letter dated 26 December 1956, subject: "USCI UFOBS REPORTS".

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest to over 7 months (June 1956). It appears that the USCI had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reason before submitting them to ATIC.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis extremely difficult, if not impossible. A preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.

In reply to request, the following answers are given to questions stated in par 7.b. Basic DF: 

a. Question 1. Object cannot be identified from photograph.
Cause of the apparent "trail" is unknown. (UNCL)

b. Question 2. No calculations of length of "trail" were made because of lack of reference points. Description of photograph of "trail" is clarified, i.e., size of satsuma grapefruit at arms length, at 10 feet, a definite distance. (UNCL)

c. Question 3. The original negative should be obtained for physical inspection and controlled density printing. Additional prints may reveal details not shown on the single print. (UNCL)

d. Camera information (focal length, shutter setting, negative size) should be obtained. Duration of the exposure should be known in order to determine if "trail" is the result of an object in motion or a definite trail. (UNCL)

SUBJ: Review and Analysis - UFO Photo 
THRU: AFOIN-4P3
TO: AFOIN-4P3
MAJOR WILNER

DATE: 15 Mar 57

COMMENT NR 2

1. In reply to your request AFOIN-4P3 submits the following in answer to questions 1, 2 and 3, respectively:

a. Question No. 1
(1) At first appearance the indication on the photograph does resemble the characteristic "sig-saw" vapor trail that is usually created by a ballistic missile during its ascent. However, vapor trails of this type appear rather suddenly and appear only in a specific area beside departing contrails on the photograph. The altitude is estimated to be approximately 20,000 feet. This trail is dispersed into its characteristic form in a matter of seconds within minutes it is diffused into an unrecognizable form.
(2) Ballistic missiles, and on some occasions air craft, have been described as creating vapor trails as described above. However, any hovering or rapid dynamic gyrations are not to be expected.
(3) Cruise missiles which might be seen at the altitudes reported would, during the period of observation, cover a range between 600 - 1200 nautical miles and could not be tracked by an observer.
(4) The opinion of this office is that the object as described is not a missile or any rocket propelled type device. The object or phenomena cannot be identified by AFOIN-4P3.

b. Question No. 2
(1) There are no missile launching sites in the area where the object was observed.

c. Question No. 3
There is no knowledge of any missile firings which have departed from the test ranges at the time described by source.

2. The contents of this comment are classified CONFIDENTIAL.

The text in the document is as follows:

The phenomenon appeared to be masses of a parafroid and gessmanite giving it a peculiar shape. At times it would disappear then reappear simultaneously, at various places in the cloud formation. The cloud formation was observed for approximately 50 minutes, and covered an area extending from the southeast to the northeast. It appeared to explore places in the cloud formation. A flash of light was observed from the formation as it traveled. In the town of Amarillo Texas, others related that they spotted the formation at 0400 hours and it arrived over Memphis, Texas, the information had already been dispatched. The formation was observed to be traveling at a rapid rate of 10 to 20 feet from its first trajectory. Upon its arrival at Memphis, Texas, the information had already been dispatched. As directed, the phenomenon appeared to be descending into the heavens, where it was the approximate size of a star and was the only visible object in the clear sky.

During this period of (2) hours and fifteen (15) minutes, the phenomenon was obscuring at intervals 1-5 minutes, and was creating a cloud formation. Its brilliance would illuminate the area within the cloud as brighter portions would pass through the cloud at points of dissipation.

I would cooperate with the USAF authorities in any way possible.

This information is forwarded for your appropriate action in accordance with paragraph 7, AFR 200-2, dated 12 August 1954.

CASE NO. 53-47
JANUARY 13, 1953
AMARILLO, TEXAS

1. On August 6, 1956, Special Agent JOSEPH H. NYLES of the Office of Special Investigations, USAF, was informed by JOHN DOE, a civilian, of an alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Amarillo, Texas, on August 1, 1956.

2. DOE stated that on the evening of August 1, 1956, he and his wife were driving east on U.S. Highway 60 approximately 25 miles west of Amarillo, Texas, when they observed a bright light in the sky. According to DOE, the object appeared to be elliptical in shape, emitting a bluish-white glow, and moving at a high rate of speed in a westerly direction.

3. DOE further stated that he brought his automobile to a stop, got out, and watched the object until it disappeared from view. He estimated the object's altitude to be approximately 10,000 feet and its speed to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour.

4. DOE stated he was unable to obtain a photograph of the object, as he did not have a camera available at the time of the sighting.

5. Special Agent NYLES interviewed DOE and obtained the above information. No further investigation was conducted, as there was no physical evidence or additional witnesses to corroborate DOE's report.

SUBJECT: Review and Analysis - UFO Photo
FROM: AFOIN-4H2
TO: AFOIN-4B3
DATE: 15 FEB 57
COMMENT NO. 1: 250/665-57/mn

Request review and analysis of attached photograph and copy of report. The attached photograph has been examined and it is considered that the photo is not "doctored", and that it represents a true representation of something in the sky at the time and place photographed.

Some comments on the photographic details are as follows:

The lighting and sharpness lines are those generally caused by the variable illumination. The nature of these lines is not characteristic of lightnin flashes, ruling out the possibility that it may be mistaken for such.  

Launching Information available to this office indicates that the closest missile launching is that of White Sands, New Mexico, a distance of some 675 miles from Amarillo, Texas.

Attached report indicates that the observer was facing in an almost northerly direction and that the sharpness or trail pattern leads one to believe that it was much closer to the observer.  

QUESTION ON THE BASIC FACTS SUBMITTED FOR SPECIFIC CONSIDERATION:

(1) Whether the missile assumption is valid.
(2) Whether there are (or were) any missile sites or operations known to have departed from its designated course, within the particular time period driven, which might explain the object.
(3) Any comments or identifications of the object which may be known to have departed from its designated course, within the particular time period driven, which might explain the object.

b. 4P-5a (1) Specific comments as to the cause or identify of object
(2) Estimated distance of the trail (assuming missile hypothesis).

The remaining text appears to be administrative information about the form and classification level.

The image contains a photograph of a newspaper article titled "Former Bomber Pilot Took Photo Of Strange Sky Object". The article discusses how a former bomber pilot named D. C. Kirby, a Dallas rock and gem collector, took a photograph of a strange light object while on a hunting expedition near Amarillo, Texas in August 1956. He reported the sighting and the photograph to authorities, who indicated they would keep the photograph and story confidential.

Dallas Morning News printed a photograph, taken August 2nd, 1956, of a six-mile trail left by an object seen near Amarillo, Texas by Dallas rock and gem collector J. C. Kirby and his family.

Former Bomber Pilot Took Photo Of Strange Sky Object

DALLAS, Nov. 5 - The Dallas Morning News said Monday that J. C. Kirby, a Dallas rare rock and gem collector, took a photograph of a strange light object while on a hunting expedition near Amarillo, Texas on August 2, 1956. He said the picture and story were held up by the Air Force until a few days ago. Kirby, a former World War II bomber pilot, said he and his wife and twin daughters saw the object while they were on a hunting trip. He said the picture shows the object leaving a six-mile trail as it sped across the sky. He said he has shown the picture to an agent who studied the features and contoured with nearby military officers at Carswell Air Force Base. He said authorities told him they could not keep the photograph and story confidential.

Dear Sirs:
My recent report concerning unidentified flying objects that I would like to obtain the official explanation of the 1952 Washington, D.C. sightings.

The official explanation of the 1952 Washington, D.C. sightings, as stated by the U.S. Air Force, was that they were unidentified radar targets. The report also mentions that the Air Force theories indicate the glow was caused by reflections from the jet fighter planes that were sent up to investigate the unidentified radar targets.

The report further states that there was a photograph released over one year later that showed an increase in radiation levels when unknown aerial objects are reported. It also mentions that there has been infrared tracking of unidentified flying objects.

The letter concludes by requesting any information about U.F.O.s obtained during Air Force exploration programs, and expresses appreciation for a prompt reply to these inquiries.

To: SAFOI-3d (H.J. Tacker)

1. The following are suggested answers to the questions penned by Mr Levine in the attached letters:
a. It must be assumed that the much publicized Washington radar sighting of 12 July 1952 is the one in question. This case was determined to be targets caused by a temperature inversion.
b. The objects in the film taken at Tremonton, Utah on 2 July 1952 were determined to be birds, probably seagulls.
c. The Air Force file carries no conclusion on the photograph taken near Amarillo, Texas on 2 August 1956. Not knowing what radiation vapor trail time exposure caused, the objects did appear unusual.
d. The Air Force file carries no conclusion on the photograph taken near Amarillo, Texas on 2 August 1956. Not knowing what radiation vapor trail time exposure caused, the objects did appear unusual.
e. The Air Force is not aware of any release date for the photograph taken by a "radar pattern" by the owner and he was free to do with it as he pleased.
f. The Air Force experience has been that there is no increase in radiation due to unidentified flying objects. It should be understood that the normal background for any area fluctuates a few hundredths of what a milliroentgen, this is considered normal and constitutes no danger whatsoever.
g. The Air Force is not aware of any statement, official or otherwise, to the effect that UFOs are space ships.
h. The Air Force has no specific knowledge of infrared tracking of unidentified flying objects.
i. The Air Force file contains no record of a report at Barber's Point, Pearl Harbor on 5 August 1953, in fact, no report from Hawaii.

FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH OF AUGUST 1953:

For the most part, information concerning UFO reports is available to the public, but due to required classification, some are not. It is the Air Force opinion that the basic answer is contained in the question itself. These sightings are intelligence reports, and as such, in certain instances contain other information apart from the UFO portion which may require classification.

Mr. Air Force is open minded on the subject of space travel, and aware that space visitors are a possibility. The present Air Force position is not to deny this possibility, but waiting to state that to date no evidence has been discovered to substantiate that UFO's are interplanetary or interstellar space ships.

1. No lunar exploration, telescopic or space probes, has revealed any additional information concerning UFO's.
