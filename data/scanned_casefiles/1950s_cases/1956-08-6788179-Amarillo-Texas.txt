16 May 1960

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 17 March and the questions concerning unidentified flying objects.

It must be assumed that the much publicized Washington radar sighting of 19 July 1952, in the one in question. This case was determined to be targets caused by a temperature inversion.

There is no record in the Air Force files of a sighting at Kinross AFB on 23 November 1953. The Kinross case, as outlined in several books and other publications on UFO's, states that an aircraft was carried away by an unidentified flying object. There is no case in the files which even closely parallels these circumstances.

The objects on the film taken at Tremonton, Utah on 2 July 1952, were determined to be birds, probably sea gulls.

The Air Force file carries no conclusion on the photograph taken by Mr. [redacted] near Amarillo, Texas on 2 August 1956. Not knowing what radiation vapor is, it is the Air Force opinion that some spokesman at the time speculated that the object was an irritated vapor trail and was probably mis-quoted.

The Air Force is not aware of any release date for the photograph taken by Mr. [redacted]. The original was in the hands of the owner and he was free to do with it as he pleased.

Air Force experience has been that there is no increase in radiation due to unidentified flying objects. It should be understood that the normal background for any area may fluctuate. A few hundredths of a milliroentgem, this is considered normal and constitutes no danger whatsoever.

The Air Force is not aware of any statement, official or otherwise, by a government agency to the effect that UFO's are space ships.

The Air Force has no specific knowledge of infrared tracking of unidentified flying objects.


- page 2 -

The Air Force file contains no record of a report at Barber's Point, Pearl Harbor on 6 August 1953. In fact, no report from Hawaii for the entire month of August 1953.

For the most part, information concerning UFO reports is available to the public, but due to required classification, some are not. It is the Air Force opinion that the best answer is contained in the question itself. These sightings are intelligence reports, and in such, in certain instances contain other information apart from the UFO portion which may require classification.

The Air Force is open minded on the subject of space travel, and aware that space visitors are a possibility. The present Air Force position is not to deny this possibility, but rather to state that to date no evidence has been discovered to substantiate that UFO's are interplanetary or interstellar space ships.

No lunar exploration, telescopic or space probe, has revealed any additional information concerning UFO's.

Hensley Field
Grand Prairie, Texas

1. At 1330 hours, 5 August 1956, Mr. [redacted] reported to the OSI Detachment Office, Hensley Field, Grand Prairie, Texas, concerning the sighting of unconventional type aircraft:

[redacted] advised that on 1 August 1956 as he was returning to Dallas, Texas from Colorado Springs, Colorado, via Amarillo, Texas, he had departed Amarillo at approximately 0400 hours on Route US 287. He averred that approximately ten (10) miles outside of Amarillo, he noted a bright green trajectory in the sky at about 10 o'clock, from an object which appeared to have landed just east of Amarillo, Texas and north of Highway 287. Shortly thereafter, he observed another trajectory, similar to the first, which emanated from a bright light in the sky, observed approximately 30 minutes earlier.

He advised that this light appeared in a cloud formation, the height of which he estimated to be approximately 10,000 to 20,000 feet. Further, that this cloud formation was approximately 50 miles in length from north to south and a lesser distance in width running east to west. Never did the phenomenon appear to descend below the level of the cloud base and moved intermittently within the cloud formation and on various occasions would move outside the extreme ends of the cloud running north to south. No sound was audible at any time during either the trajectory or the movement of the object itself.

Unidentifiable Flying Objects (UFOB)

The phenomenon appeared to be the size of a grapefruit and appeared
in brilliance equal to the ignition of phosphorus, giving a brilliant
beam of light both above and below the phenomenon itself, but never
both beams simultaneously. At various times, a faint trace of red,
varying its position on the phenomenon, was observed. The object
appeared to be extremely navigable, inasmuch as it appeared in
various places in the cloud formation. The object was observed
intermittently by [redacted] and his wife between Amarillo and Memphis,
Texas. [redacted] further related that the second
trajectory appeared 10 to 20 feet from the first trajectory. According to [redacted], the cloud formation was moving rapidly and upon his
arrival at Memphis, Texas, the formation had begun to disintegrate.

As daylight approached, the phenomenon appeared to be ascending into
the heavens, where it the approximate size of a star and no longer
visible through the clouds, but visible outside the cloud formation.
During the two (2) hours and fifteen (15) minutes that the phenomenon
was observed, [redacted] advised that as it moved to the open spaces within
the cloud formation, its brilliance would illuminate these portions within
the cloud structure. As it proceeded through the clouds to the opposite outer extremities, no illumination was visible within the cloud
structure. [redacted] a World War II Bomber Pilot, who flew B-17 type
aircraft, with the Eighth Air Force, advised that in his experience with
aircraft, weather conditions, etc., he had never observed anything comparable with this phenomenon.

A photograph of instant phenomenon taken by [redacted] with a
Kodak 520 Camera is attached as an inclosure. [redacted] advised that
he would retain the negative of the photograph taken. Further, that
he would cooperate with the USAF authorities in any way possible.

2. The above information was furnished the Dallas Field Office,
FBI, by [redacted] on 2 August 1956.

3. This information is forwarded for your appropriate action in
accordance with paragraph 7, AFR 200-2, dated 12 August 1954.

MEMORANDUM FOR UFO FILES

SUBJECT: Late Receipt of UFO Reports

1. This items of six (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover letter by the 46024 AISS, who received them from the OSI. Reference "46024 AISS File," letter dated 26 December 1956, subject "OSI UTOB Reports."

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest, to over 7 months for the newest (August 1956). It appears that the OSI had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reason before submitting them to the 46024 AISS.

4. The way late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis difficult, if not impossible. A preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.

1. In reply to your request AFOIN-453 submits the following in answer to questions 1, 2 and 3, respectively:

a. Question No. 1

   (1) At first appearance the indication on the photograph does resemble the characteristic "zig-zag" vapor trail that is usually created by a ballistic missile during its ascent. However, vapor trails of this type appear rather suddenly and appear only in a specific strata which depends on the weather condition of the atmosphere at that time. This strata may lie between 20,000 - 45,000 Feet. This trail is dispersed into its characteristic form in a matter of seconds; within minutes it is diffused into an unrecognizable form.

   (2) Ballistic missiles, and on some occasions surface-to-air missiles, are expected to create vapor trails such as described above. The time of powered flight of these missiles is measured in seconds and any hovering or rapid dynamic gyrations are not to be expected.

   (3) Cruise missiles which might be seen at the altitudes reported would, during the period of observation, cover a range between 600 - 1200 nautical miles and could not be tracked by an observer for the entire period.

   (4) The opinion of this office is that the object as described is not a missile or any rocket propelled type device. The object or phenomena cannot be identified by AFOIN-453c.

b. Question No. 2

   (1) There are no missile launching sites in the area where the object was observed.

c. Question No. 3

   There is no knowledge of any missile firings which have departed from the test range area at the time described by source.

2. The contents of this comment are classified CONFIDENTIAL.

1. Per request your review and analysis of attached photograph and copy of original report.

2. A microscopic examination discloses that the photo is not "doctored", and current photo emission tests indicate no signs of fabrication.

3. The absence of any horizon, objects or perspective for contrast or comparison purposes makes analysis somewhat difficult. In the opinion of this office, the bands shown here and the trail markings, guided missile launchings, and trails shown here appear to be similar to those left in the wake of missiles.

4. The trailing, overlapping lines are those generally formed by the variable winds encountered by missiles in their trajectory at various altitudes. The pattern of these lines is not characteristic of lightning flashes, ruling out that phenomenon.

5. Information available to this office indicates that the closest missile launching site to observer's location is White Sands, New Mexico, a distance of approximately 300 miles from Amarillo.

6. Attached report indicates that the observer was facing in an almost directly opposite direction from White Sands; and that the sharpness of the pattern seems to believe that it was much closer to the observer.

7. Therefore, on the basis of above, the following are submitted for specific consideration:

a. AF-3     (1) Whether the missile assumption is valid.
            (2) Whether there are (or were) any missile sites or operations in the general direction or vicinity reported.
            (3) Any knowledge of missile firing, which a missile firing is known to have departed from its designated course, within the particular time period given, might explain the phenomenon.

b. MD-2     (1) Specific comments as to the cause or identity of object in photograph.
            (2) Estimated distance of the trail (assuming missile hypothesis using characteristics of camera equipment used).

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a clipping from our local newspaper regarding the appearance of radiation vapor recently seen in Amarillo, Texas.

A faculty member has taken issue with this photograph. He feels that in view of the many perfect cubes and further since the photographer is a lapidary, he is of the opinion that it is a trick photograph made with stones or with a lavelier. The information is volunteered as an effort to assist the Air Force in this investigation and further to prevent lost time in pursuing false leads.

The Dallas Morning News carried a picture today of a strange light a former bomber pilot took near Amarillo at 4 a.m. Aug. 2, 1956. He said the picture and story were held up by the FBI and Air Force authorities until a few days ago.

He said he had snapped the picture with a small camera and called the FBI on his return to Dallas.

He said he had a visit from an agent who studied the picture and conferred with authorities at nearby Hensley Field.

He said authorities told him only recently he no longer had to keep the photo and story quiet. Kirby said the Air Force theorized the glow was radiation vapor.

Dear Sirs:

There are several questions concerning unidentified flying objects that I would like to have answered.

1. What is the official explanation of the 1952 Washington D.C. sightings?

2. An F-89 Force plane merge with an unidentified blip near Kinross Air Force Base on November 23, 1953?

3. What is the explanation or conclusion reached concerning the U.S.O. film taken at Tremonton?

4. Did the Air Force theories that the glow in the photograph taken by Mariana on August 2, 1956 was caused by radiation post?

5. Was this photograph released over one year after it was taken?

6. Has there been an increase in radiation levels when unknown aerial objects are reported?

7. According to Dugdale's statement that a report was released concluding that U.F.O.'s are "space ships" accurate?

8. Has there been infrared tracking of unidentified flying objects?

9. What was the Air Force conclusion concerning the U.F.O. report at Barber's Point, Pearl Harbor on August 6, 1953?

10. Are Air Force Intelligence reports of U.F.O.'s unavailable to the public?

11. Does the Air Force rule out the possibility that U.F.O.'s are interplanetary or interstellar space ships?

12. Was any information about U.F.O.'s obtained during the Air Force lunar exploration program?

I will appreciate a prompt reply to these inquiries.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFOIN-452

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information (Mr Richard Levine)

TO: SAFOI-3d (Maj Tacker)                                    29 APR 1960

1. The following are suggested answers to the questions penned by
Mr Levine in the attached letter:

    a. It must be assumed that the much publicized Washington radar
    sighting of 19 July 1952, is the one in question. This case was deter-
    mined to be targets caused by a temperature inversion.

    b. There is no record in the Air Force files of a sighting at
    Kinross AFB on 23 November 1953. The Kinross case, as outlined in
    several books and other publications on UFO's, states that an aircraft
    was carried away by an unidentified flying object. There is no case
    in the files which even closely parallels these circumstances.

    c. The objects on the film taken at Tremonton, Utah on 2 July 1952,
    were determined to be birds, probably sea gulls.

    d. The Air Force file carries no conclusion on the photograph taken
    by [redacted] near Amarillo, Texas on 2 August 1956. Not knowing
    what radiation vapor is, it is the Air Force opinion that some spokes-
    man at the time speculated that the object was an irradiated vapor trial
    and was [redacted].

    e. The Air Force is not aware of any release date for the photo-
    graph taken by [redacted]. The original was in the hands of the owner
    and he was free to do with it as he pleased.

    f. Air Force experience has been that there is no increase in
    radiation due to unidentified flying objects. It should be understood
    that the normal background for any area may fluctuate a few hundreds
    of a roentgen, this is considered normal and constitutes no danger
    whatsoever.

    g. The Air Force is not aware of any statement, official or other-
    wise, by a government agency to the effect that UFO's are space ships.

    h. The Air Force has no specific knowledge of infrared tracking of
    unidentified flying objects.

    i. The Air Force file contains no record of a report at Barber's
    Point, Pearl Harbor on 6 August 1953, in fact, no report from Hawaii


- page 25 -

for the entire month of August 1953.

J. For the most part, information concerning UFO reports is avail-
able to the public, but due to required classification, some are not.
It is the Air Force opinion that the best answer is contained in the
question itself. These sightings are intelligence reports, and as such,
in certain instances contain other information apart from the UFO por-
tion which may require classification.

k. The Air Force is open minded on the subject of space travel, and
aware that space visitors are a possibility. The present Air Force posi-
tion is not to deny this possibility, but rather to state that to date
no evidence has been discovered to substantiate that UFO's are inter-
planetary or interstellar space ships.

1. No lunar exploration, telescopic or space probe, has revealed
any additional information concerning UFO's.
