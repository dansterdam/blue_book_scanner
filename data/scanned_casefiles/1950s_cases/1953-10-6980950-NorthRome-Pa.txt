1. The New York Field Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, has advised this district that Special Agent HAROLD K. ALLEN, Jr., has obtained the following information from the U. S. Department of Labor, 215 Montague Street, Room 512, Brooklyn, New York:

On 10/3/53, while visiting at North Rome Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, he observed an unidentified object in the sky between 8:00 and 8:15 p.m. on October 3, 1953. He advised that he sighted the object from outside of his residence which is about one mile outside of North Rome Township on the road toward Elmira, New York. He stated the object was in a stationary position and traveled in a northerly direction at a slight angle. It appeared stationary when first sighted but then sighted on a fixed object as it was found to be moving slightly upward and down in a close area. It hovered in the air similar to a helicopter. It appeared I did not emit any sound nor was there any exhaust steam visible.

The object was seen by Mrs. and also by

Meteors in the Records
The American Meteorites Society, whose members specialize in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant and direction of movement. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS number. The data were published in Meteorites, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.
The records of the society for the years 1950 to 1955 list dozens of fireballs, many of them green, that were somehow overlooked by meteor enthusiasts. On August 11, 1950, during the maximum of the Perseid shower, a blue-green fireball (AMS 239-50) appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It was observed by more than 1000 witnesses, and it is brilliant that it showed a noticeable disk. It flew in a horizontal path, silently broke into pieces, and disappeared (R. p. 373).
September 20, the same year, was a big day for meteors. At 1:32 A.M. a giant fireball (AMS 296-50) roared over southwestern Illinois from north to south, leaving a luminous train visible in five states and illuminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville and from Memphis to Knoxville. The first full descriptions, over a month later, were heard over an area 300 miles square, proving the ball must have been of considerable size. Fragments showered farms over a twenty-five mile area, struck five buildings, and shattered a plate-glass window in Murray, Calloway County, Kentucky, and are now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. That same night, over Kentucky and Tennessee, dozens of fireballs were reported by plane crews flying over a six-state area - Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico to p. 115. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 27, 1953 (AMS 321-53), October 4, 1953 (AMS 330), May 15, 1954, and October 27, 1954 (AMS 3337).

There is no photograph present in this page of the Project Blue Book document. The image shows a typed report describing a "fireball" or unidentified aerial object observed on October 7/8, 1953. The report provides details about the sighting, including the time, location, direction, speed, and other characteristics of the observed object.

FIREBALL OF 1953 OCTOBER 7/8
U.F.O. NO. 2577
On this date a bright fireball or meteor-like was observed at 7:32 p.m., E.S.T., by W. G. 
The whole path, with a diagram, was obtained at 51 and part of the path obtained at 52. The path obtained at 51 was vertical, and completes at end. At 52 it was recorded as a 4 to 6 magnitude, vertical train, and that it appeared within 30 degrees of the zenith at 52. The end of the train or tail was not noted on the record at 52.
The following data were obtained: 
Date: 7 October 1953
Sidereal time at end point: 3h 13m 
Ended over: A = 23째00', 8 = 40째39' 
Height of path: 63 km
Length of path: A = 23째00', 8 = 60째16' = 91 km
Radiant corrected for zenith attraction: a = 252", b = -1".
At the position is found in the Hoffmeister-van Niesel Catalogue, nothing at this position and date is found.
