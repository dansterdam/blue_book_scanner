1. The New York Field Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, has advised this district that Special Agent HAROLD K. ALLEN, Jr., has obtained the following information from Mr. [redacted], U. S. Department of Labor, 215 Montague Street, Room 512, Brooklyn, New York:

"[redacted] stated that while visiting at North Rome Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, he observed an unidentified object in the sky between 8:00 and 8:15 pm on October 3, 1953. He advised that he sighted the object from outside of his residence which is the first house outside of North Rome Township on the road toward Lake Nessmling, Pennsylvania. The object appeared to be about two miles distance and in a northwesterly direction with approximately fifteen degrees altitude over the horizon. It appeared stationary when first sighted, but when sighted on a fixed object it was found to be moved slightly sideways and up and down in a close area. It hovered in the air similar to a helicopter. It appeared larger than a star and was emitting an orange pulsating light. It did not emit any sound nor was there any exhaust steam visible.

The object was seen by Mrs. [redacted] same address, and also by [redacted] of North Rome Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, R.F.D. #5. They all concurred with what [redacted] had stated.

[redacted] recalled seeing the same object at approximately the same location a year previously.

Mrs. informed her husband that she had observed the
object in the same location several times previously this
year.

recalled a rumor that a metallic flying object was
found several years previously in approximately the same
area where he had sighted the unidentifiable object on
October 3, 1953. He stated that he is available at the
United States Department of Labor, 215 Montague Street,
Brooklyn, for any additional assistance the might
render.

2. No investigation is contemplated by this district.

Meteors in the Records

The American Meteoritics Society, whose members specialize in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant—the point in the heavens from which it seems to come. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS number. The data were published in Meteoritics, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.

The records of the society for the years 1950 to 1955 list dozens of fireballs, many of them green, that were somehow overlooked by saucer enthusiasts. On August 11, 1950, during the maximum of the Perseid shower, a blue-green fireball (AMS 2236) apparently oval or cigar-shaped, appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho at 7:30 P.M. and was reported by more than 100 witnesses. So brilliant that it showed a noticeable disk, it flew in a horizontal path, silently broke into three pieces, and disappeared [8, p. 379].

September 30, the same year, was a big day for meteors. At 1:35 A.M. a giant fireball (AMS 2236) roared over southeastern Illinois from north to south, leaving a luminous train visible in five states and illuminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville and from Memphis to Knoxville. The final detonation, over western Kentucky, was heard over an area 1000 miles square and shook buildings from Paducah to Memphis. Fragments showered farm over a twenty-five mile area, struck buildings, and penetrated one roof. About fifty pounds of meteorites dropped in Murray, Calloway County, Kentucky, and are now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. That same night about 10:45 P.M., fireballs were reported by plane crews flying over a six-state area—Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico [9, p. 115]. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 28, 1953 (AMS 2331); October 4, 1953 (AMS 2339); May 15, 1954; and October 27, 1954 (AMS 2357).

FIREBALL OF 1953 OCTOBER 7/8
A.M.S. No. 237

On this date a bright fireball or bolide was observed at 7:32 p.m., E.S.T., by W. G. Cleaver at New Haven, Conn., S1, and by Leith Holloway, Philadelphia, Pa., S2. The whole path, with a diagram, was obtained at S1 and part of the path (rest obtained at S2) was plotted. At S1 it was noted as horizontal, no less than train, and coordinates estimated. At S2 it was recorded as 5 or 6 magnitude, vertical path and exploded at end, part was traversed in 3 to 4 seconds. After some train this bolide was computed, which however must be approximate as only part of the path was seen at S2.

Sideral time at end point: 1193 October 7.52 G.M.T.
Begin over: 31°
Ended over: λ = 73°14', Ε = -40°27' at 149 km
Length of path: λ = 73°00', Ε = -40°19' at 91 km
Projected length of path: a = 257°, h = -41.5°
Radiant corrected for zenith attraction: w = +14°, δ = -32°

As the radiant is only approximate no orbit is computed.
Nothing at this position and date in the Hoffmeister-van Niesel Catalogue.
