Utica, New York
April 3, 1966

Wash. D.C.

Dear Sir:

Quite belatedly, I have decided to report a UFO sighting. This took place eight years ago near Remsen (Oneida Co.), 15 miles north of Utica, New York.

Noting that there is an increase in reported sightings lately and your office is interested in sending each for comparison studies, I have decided I might not be considered a crank by reporting my experience.

On Mar. 16, 1958 there was still considerable covering of snow on the ground. At 10:45 P.M. on that

Here is the text from the document:

A clear, cold night. I walked down a hilly country road near our old home, ahead and about 4 miles to the right I saw a light which I at first thought to be that of a train which would be hiding north on the tracks which cross the country road about half a mile ahead of me. As I walked along I suddenly realized it could not be the train. It was veering away from the tracks, over the woods, and coming westward toward me, about 100 feet altitude. It seemed larger as it approached and stopped, wondering how to get out of its path. For a fleeting moment, as it hovered what seemed like 50 feet away near the top of the

impression it was someone
or something trying blind
me by bringing this huge light
(like a wash tub sized flash-
light) directly up to my face.
I don't know how much closer
it actually came. I felt heat
from the obstacle and unable
to find my voice, I ducked
near a snow bank. I felt
the warmth pass over then
turned up, turned, and saw the
fringe of its glow as it went
over the woods in the other
side of the road in a southerly
direction.

The light was mostly white
except once when still about

"a mile away it seemed to
have a blue-green haze around
it and again as it approached
the hill near me.

I had read only a little
about UFOs and had not
been overly interested. mostly
the sightings were labeled out
fragments of the imagination. only
lately have some have reported
seeing these objects as close
than distant lights. I thought
my experience might be worth
reporting.

Yours truly,"

Constellations Shine
As the new year begins, astronomers prepare for the events to come, including two solar eclipses and one lunar, and the opportunity to study Mars as it approaches the earth.

By JAMES STOKLEY

[Most of the first column's text is partially illegible due to image quality, but appears to discuss astronomical observations]

Mercury Rises Early
On Jan 15 Mercury, which will then be in Sagittarius, the archer, will be further west of the sun, and will rise before sunrise. In the next few days around this date it will be a conspicuous bright star rising before the sun. At greatest elongation it will be hard to see because of the sun's glare.

Aldebaran: Bull's Eye
[Text about Aldebaran is partially cut off and difficult to read]

[The document includes two star charts labeled "Face North" showing constellations, with a note at the bottom: "SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS"]

Total Eclipse of the Sun
The second eclipse of the sun will occur on Columbus Day, Oct. 12. This is total, with the moon completely covering the sun, for more than five minutes at the most favorable location. The path of totality [rest of text cut off]

No Case (Information Only)

3 January 1958
Diamond Head, Hawaii

FLYING SAUCER CAPTURED ON FILM IN HAWAII: One of the very rare instances of genuine flying saucers being caught on movie film seems to have occurred in Hawaii last January, when 20 year-old college student, while in Waikiki last January, when 20 seconds of film. Delacy saw nine "UFO's" across the sky, and immediately grabbed his camera. Calling these as reference as to what he saw, he gave viewers a reference as to the unidentified objects. The camera was pointed at a large area, and relative point of the unknown object. Flying at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet, and banking to what appears to be no more than 1,000 feet at most. They are spherical, and no tail fins or other projections are visible. In fact, they are so small that it is by far the best of the less train-like form and most clear, and that it is by far the best of the less grain-like form and most clear.

In 1958, ten UFO photographs were taken. On January 3 at Diamond Head, Hawaii a junior college student caught several of 9 UFOs on color film for 80 seconds.
