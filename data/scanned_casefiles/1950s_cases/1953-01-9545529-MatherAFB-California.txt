The first object I saw was circular shape, round and flat like a pie tin or plate. It was very bright; a brilliant silver-white color. I watched it for about 2 minutes. The object seemed to wobble in the sky and then streaked off at a tremendous speed. It crossed the sky in 3 or 4 seconds. The object held about 15 or 20 feet away. I judged it was about 20 to 30 miles distant. The object was hovering at about 500 feet above the ground. The objects were not in formation. They left no trail or exhaust. All three objects were of the same general type. One object passed in front of the other. It appeared to be a disc, about 30 feet in diameter, 10 to 12 feet thick. The speed was over 500 knots. There was a brief red glow. The incidents occurred at about 10:35 PM on 9 December 1952. The objects were estimated to be 5 in the area of Matherfield, California. The weather was clear - there were no clouds or wind. I have no idea what these objects were, but I am convinced they are not any known type of aircraft. I was a Captain, Flight Surgeon, working in the Aeromedical Training Center.

I ORIGINALLY SIGHTED FOUR OBJECTS. ONE OF WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY BRILLIANT. I FIRST OBSERVED THEM OVER THE MATHAR AIR FORCE BASE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA AT ABOUT 8:15 P.M. ON JANUARY 9, 1953. THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING ACROSS THE SKY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND WERE HEADING WEST. THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE METALLIC AND ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE. THE LEAD OBJECT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHERS, EMITTING A WHITE, PULSATING LIGHT. THE OTHER THREE OBJECTS WERE LESS BRILLIANT, EMITTING A DULL, RED LIGHT. THE OBJECTS WERE UNDER EXCELLENT VISIBILITY CONDITIONS AND WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE. THEY APPEARED TO BE AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 30,000 FEET. WHEN FIRST SIGHTED, THE OBJECTS WERE TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE, BUT LATER THEY MADE ABRUPT TURNS AND DIVES, VARYING THEIR SPEED CONSIDERABLY. TOWARDS THE END OF THE OBSERVATION, THEY SEEMED TO ACCELERATE AND DISAPPEAR FROM SIGHT IN A SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION. THE SIGHTING WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL OTHER RELIABLE WITNESSES IN THE AREA OF THE MATHAR AIR FORCE BASE.
