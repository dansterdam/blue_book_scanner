The first object I saw was circular shape, round and flat like a pie tin or plate. It was very bright; a brilliant silver. I watched it for about a minute or a minute and a half, and four more appeared then disappeared. The one got about 30 miles away from us. It was about the size of a head on a pin head about 15 or 20 feet away. I judged it was about 40 to 50 miles ahead of us. It was about 15 or possibly 20 thousand feet in altitude. It came straight on toward our airplane. It seemed to stop and retreat again. The objects seen were not in formation. They left no trail or exhaust. All were could be characterized by nothing more than a vague, hazy, silvery object. The object was observed for about four or five minutes visually from the air. Type of aircraft was a T-29. Location was approximately 200 miles west of Mather, at 3,000 feet. We did not have radar. These objects were observed while flying west. Orientation - California - 26 degrees 40 minutes north, latitude 119 degrees 30 minutes west. Objects were estimated to be in the area of Bakersfield, California, 35 degrees 35 minutes north latitude, 119 degrees 30 minutes west. Long- tudes. At the time of observation we were wearing smoked colored sun glasses. The weather was clear - there were no clouds. Winds aloft were about 25 knots.

Service. Several of Mather's T-29 aircraft were flying missions in the San Joaquin Valley area. I am a recent recall 20 year old 1st Lt. 3 years of service during World War II. I was inactive in 1945 and recalled in November 1952. I was with the Reserve Unit, 4420th Troop Carrier Wing, 1st Air Force Reserve Combat Training Center.

I originally sighted four objects. One of them was particularly brilliant in another to be other strange. Then I first saw the objects in a cluster of four jets. I took another look at them. They were not jets or conventional type aircraft. The maneuver appeared to be a tumbling within themselves a banked roll or turn. They were passing into a steep others curve and an intensely brilliant lights, almost like golden vapor. It was observed and timed. In the continuing period the objects were heading on a definite shape. It would retreat just as rapidly as it closed in. There was about a 5 degree interval from of travel. I would estimate course 20 to 50 miles from us. It was down over the mountains near Bakersfield, then it was moving south to southwest. I was using the windshield center point to gage the sides of the disk. It moved about 3 to 10 inches from the windshield center, gradually moving from the south to the southwest. I though we were going to have a mid-air collision. Length of time observed was five minutes. Manner of observation T-29. Pilot and co-pilot position. True course was 164 - heading was 161. In plain view and long period - 20 degrees and 20 minutes course, 119 degrees, 140 minutes west. I estimated the disks to be about 12,000 in altitude; 20 to 50 miles away. Beneath the area in which I judged the objects to have been, there was about 7/10's layer of clouds. They were maneuvering about the stratus. There was a haze layer at about 4,000 feet. It was very close to our altitude. Visibility was close to 100 miles. The mountains south of Bakersfield could be seen very clearly. Disks aloft were practically stationary. I have seen no other aircraft in the area. I was in continued active service. I have observed jets in formation but not doing formation aerobatics. The reflection was too intense to say it was no aluminum jet. It was very unusual. There was no colored plume and asked him if he had observed anything but he didn't have glasses. Then the glasses were removed, there was nothing but haze. With the glasses on I could see the images. Fresno radio was notified. There was no other air traffic noticed in this vicinity.

Maneuvers performed were of a tumbling nature - three objects eventually faded from view. The tumbling object would appear and vanish toward an extremely high rate of clearance. The course made appeared to be a collision course and would have hit the area. The object was either approaching or able to control the intensity of light emitted.
