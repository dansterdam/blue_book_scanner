Sir:

In reference to three recent phone conversations with your command in reference to unidentified objects over the city of Baltimore. It has been requested that the undersigned file a report of same.

1st Observation
Date: August 13 - Time: 2205 - 2235
Observers Location: 3900 Windsor Ave. Section of city, west

Object: Bright red flashing light similar to speed of a photo flash bulb. Time closed: for 1st observation, flashes were spaced approximately (20) seconds apart. Balance of time observed, flash intervals were further apart, up to (1) minute and 1.0 seconds.

Movement of light was erratic, moving in an area of approximately (2) miles from nearest point of observation. Altitude from approximately 50 above horizon to about 15°. Appearing to be about over Eastern section of city. Direction of 14 from approximately due East. Light was observed by (3) adults.

The light was definitely not an aircraft or air ship of any type. How it was 14 miles, run flashes or any other vehicle or flying craft such a flash. Observation reported to Air Tract Filter Center, and P. S. K.

2nd Observation
Date: August 24th, 1952 - Time: 2315
Observers Location: Indicated for 1st observation

Object was first observed by writers family from 1200 Salveders Ave.
this city. This person phoned writers or his friend. Photographs in and developed of object. Due to the location of 3900 Windsor Ave., and the 1200 block Delaware Ave., the writer could have made an error of object. However, a brilliant white light was observed over Eastern section of city. Light was very slowly moving; however, after a period of approximately 10 minutes, appeared to stop, for duration of observation.

3rd Observation
Identical to 1st observation, except for flashes brilliant and changing to more or less copper color. Time close of observation between 2200 and 2230. Object observed by (3) adults.

P.S.

Notes Incest 8/18/52. Time 2200 - 2230 - Locations: north observed area light identical to hot observations. The intervals of "then" were good in an longer space. With observed a with flying a flight of approximately same. Color of light "white" and "white" and which was not definite. Found observation in to other sectors. A the 21 with was more on the base time or place.

The document appears to be a UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book, discussing a radar and visual observation of an unidentified object.
