C.R.I.F.O. 
Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects

Dear Captain Smorey,

I have carefully examined the report of your sighting of an unknown aerial object on 9 August 1956 in the Cincinnati, Ohio area. The substance of your report indicates that you observed an aerial phenomenon which appeared to be a disc-shaped object traveling at high speed and making a course reversal. 

Your observation is of interest and is being included in the records of the Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects organization for further study and analysis. The characteristics you described, such as the high speed, abrupt course change, and metallic appearance are suggestive of the type of phenomena that have been reported in numerous other reliable sightings. 

While the nature and origin of these objects remains unknown, the accumulating evidence from credible observer reports continues to indicate the existence of aerial phenomena which do not conform to any conventional aircraft or known natural phenomena. Further investigation and careful analysis of all related data is clearly necessary to gain a better understanding of these puzzling occurrences.

I appreciate your cooperation in providing this report, and I assure you that it will receive our full consideration and study. Please feel free to submit any additional information or observations that may come to your attention.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
C.R.I.F.O.

Text from the document:

"The following is a transcription of a letter written on November 23, 1955:
'Dear Sir:
This is in reference to the U.F.O. sighting reported at Cincinnati, Ohio, on September 7, 1956.
The following is a summary of the available information:
On September 7, 1956 at approximately 9:00 p.m. EDT, Mr. [REDACTED] and four other witnesses observed a bright light or object in the sky which appeared to be hovering over the Riverfront area of Cincinnati, Ohio. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The witnesses described the object as being round in shape, orange-red in color, and larger than a star or planet. The object was reported to have made a rapid upward movement and then hovered again. No sound was reported.
'Dr. [REDACTED] was contacted and he stated that he had a sighting very similar to the one described above. His sighting occurred on September 7, 1956 at approximately 9:00 p.m. EDT. Dr. [REDACTED] stated that the object appeared to be round in shape, orange-red in color, and larger than a star or planet. He further stated that the object appeared to hover and then make a rapid upward movement, remaining visible for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
'In view of the similarity of the descriptions and the time of the sightings, it is believed that both Mr. [REDACTED] and Dr. [REDACTED] were observing the same object.'
The following is also a transcription:
'September 7, 1956
Cincinnati, Ohio
7:30 p.m.
DETAILS:
Dr. [REDACTED] telephonically reported observing an unidentified flying object on the evening of September 7, 1956 at approximately 9:00 p.m. EDT. Dr. [REDACTED] stated that he was sitting on his front porch at his residence in Cincinnati, Ohio, when he observed a bright, reddish-orange light or object in the sky over the Riverfront area of Cincinnati. Dr. [REDACTED] stated that the object appeared to be round in shape and larger than a star or planet. He further stated that the object remained hovering in the sky for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and then made a rapid upward movement and disappeared from sight. Dr. [REDACTED] stated that no sound was associated with the object. Dr. [REDACTED] stated that the object was visible for a total of approximately 10 to 15 minutes.'

"Following is a report from a letter received on August 23, 1956:

Report of unidentified flying object near Cincinnati, Ohio, at 9:55 p.m. on September 12, 1955. The object was described as round, white in color, and about the size of a regular passenger aircraft. It was observed for several minutes hovering and moving around, then it accelerated at a very rapid rate and disappeared into the sky. No sound was heard. 

The witness, a man in his late 40's, was a reputable citizen and his report was considered reliable. He stated that there were no other witnesses to this incident. Due to the lateness of the hour, he did not attempt to get any photographs.

So from the data at hand, this appears to have been an unidentified aerial phenomenon. There is no further information available regarding this incident.

Sincerely,

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

C. R. I. F. O.
ORBIT
VOL. III - NO. 8
NOVEMBER 5, 1956
SIGHTINGS, SILENCE AND THE STATUS QUO
Reports received from various parts of the country indicate that sightings of unidentified flying objects and aerial phenomena have continued at a relatively high rate during the past two months. Most of these are of the usual "lights in the sky" variety, although a few involve more spectacular occurrences. However, the silence of the press, the Air Force, and the permanent "authorities" on the subject is almost deafening. Apparently, they hope that by ignoring the subject it will "go away" and cease to trouble the public. But this policy of silence, in the face of mounting public interest and concern, can hardly be considered wise or justified. 
From time to time, reports of unusual sightings with photographic evidence are brought to light, but for some reason or other these are usually suppressed or "explained away" in a rather unconvincing manner. For example, the recent sightings over Washington, D.C., which provoked a massive air Force investigation, were finally dismissed as the result of "temperature inversions" causing radar reflections. This explanation fails to convince the many reputable witnesses who reported seeing the actual craft, some at close range.
As the number of sightings continues to mount, and the observations become more detailed and specific, it becomes increasingly difficult to continue the policy of either ignoring or "explaining away" the phenomenon. More and more people are demanding a frank and honest appraisal of the situation. And, in the meantime, the secrecy and silence of the authorities merely serves to heighten public speculation and concern.
Somewhere in the mass of reports and data which have accumulated over the years, there must surely be enough solid information to draw some tentative conclusions. The refusal of the "powers that be" to analyze and evaluate this data in an objective manner can only lead to an erosion of public confidence. The time has come when a more positive and enlightened policy of investigation and public education on this subject is urgently needed.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

According to the OCR output, the text in the document is as follows:

"a foot long and two inches wide and deep in the black-painted cabin with a motor mounted with a mother object. The bottom of the object was convex and some concentric circles were seen on two protrusions that seemed to be hatches and no warning lights in the area to indicate something from outer space.

Case 225, Williston, N. Dak., Sept. 23, 1955—We quote from a letter received as follows: "On the first take of this object, it was coming toward us and seemed to stop suddenly and hang almost stationary. It was a bright light, four to six feet in diameter, circular in shape and with a slight teardrop effect. The object then split into six or seven smaller objects, each as bright as the original object."

The object was described as aluminium-colored, emitting a bluish-white light which was fairly steady and not flickering. It was one half mile in diameter and appeared to be somewhat closer to the observer than the Great Northern RR embankment.

The observer, who was a pilot, said that although he was adjusting his telescope Saturday evening, the object did not seem to be connected with any telescope mounting or any other equipment he had. According to the Grand Rapids Herald, a pilot said two young children observed the object while driving the family car.

Mrs. Dorothy Muldoon of South Bend, told the following story: "Around 4:30 p.m. I saw an object floating through the sky. Something went by under my right wing going like the wind. Stopped, hovered for a moment and then shot off again at terrific speed. I tried to get a closer look but I couldn't." This object, she said, had a Delta wing shape and resembled an airplane, but was much faster than any plane.

Under Case 225 at Columbus, Ohio, Sept. 25, 1955—In this case, eight cigar-shaped objects followed an airliner at 1:50 p.m. The objects were larger than the plane which was the usual commercial type. They came in from a long distance and then went up and out of sight. It won't be very long before someone succeeds in getting a good photograph of these objects.

Case 226, Detroit, Mich., Sept. 25, 1956—Under the headlines, "Mystery Blasts Unexplained" the Detroit Times said the following: "The Jinks occurred shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday night in a downtown neighborhood of Detroit. Residents thought they heard a loud explosion. A check by police showed no signs of fire or explosions, but something unusual had occurred."

According to the Detroit News, the county sheriff reported that two police officers heard a loud blast and later that same night reported seeing a bright object flash across the night sky and disappear. A spokesman for the Detroit-Wayne Airport control tower reported receiving an unidentified blip on their radar scope at the time of the blast. There were no explanations offered for the strange phenomenon."

"9:30 p.m. Police departments of a dozen communities were besieged with calls reporting the explosion which followed as 4 bright flying objects, moving at varying speeds and altitudes, were seen from various parts of the area. The objects seemed to be surrounded by a bluish-white glow."

"Capt. 290, Trenton, N. Jersey, Oct. 4, 1956 - We quote the following: "Yesterday evening at about 8:30 p.m. the Scuddevant is a night watchman at the American Sales Store in Budd Lake, N. J. whose duty it is to guard the building and surrounding area. About 8:30 p.m. he observed four bright objects in the sky moving swiftly up the Delaware River. It came within a few feet of the water and then flew away. The objects were large, probably over 100 feet in length - and it did not make a sound. He said they moved in a bizarre fashion up and down, side to side. Stranger of all was the silverish streak that seemed to connect the objects, she said."

"Mrs. James Farley reported the following: Four silvery objects, according to her, were seen moving swiftly up and down, side to side. Strangest of all was the silverish streak that seemed to connect three of the objects, she said."

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. The image shows a scanned page of text which appears to be a memorandum discussing the identification of fibers. The text contains a detailed analysis of the properties and characteristics of the fibers, comparing their similarities and differences to other synthetic materials.

MEMORANDUM

To: Leatherland 
Subject: Identification of Fibers

A sample of fibers was brought in for identification. Microscopical examination reveals that these fibers are multifilament under.

The individual fibers seem to be monofilaments and not staple fibers. 

The individual filaments are unusually small being about 2 to 4 microns in diameter. A rough birefringence measurement gave a 0.022. The filaments seem to be slightly oval in cross section though so sections were nearly circular. The oval shape may cause some error in birefringence, but the range of birefringence for regenerated cellulose is 0.021 to 0.029.

The birefringence* of some other synthetics are nylon 0.060, dynel 0.065, dacron 0.173, orlon-0.002, and acrilari -0.005. The size and birefringence also eliminate all natural fibers originating with the possible exception of spider web and this seems unlikely since it would be difficult to make yarns of it. The fibers are insoluble in acetic acid, chloroform, dimethylformamide, and 90 per cent phenol. They are soluble in cuprammonium hydroxide and also in concentrated HCl. This is characteristic of regenerated cellulose fibers, either viscose or cupraammon rayon. This solubility behavior eliminates cellophane, cellulose acetate, viscose H, Arnel, Verel, Orion, acrilari, and dacron.

It is difficult to distinguish between the viscose and cupraammon regenerated celluloses. In ordinary size ranges they usually differ in cross section, but in this size it would probably not be possible to distinguish them. Matthew's Textile Fibers, 4th edition, edited by H. R. Mauersberger, gives birefringence is the difference between the refractive indices of the fast and slow vibrating parallel to and perpendicular to the long axis of the filament.

a. Textile sample:
The sample purported to be so-called "angel's-hair" which has been disseminated and micro-analyzed.

The material shows no unusual characteristics and did not volatilize.
This is in the type of material sometime widely disseminated as having supernatural or unidentified characteristics. It is in no sense a product of other than normal textile manufacturing process.

September 26, 1956

Major H. G. Shaw, C. O.
Air Material Intelligence Command
Wright-Patterson AFB,
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Shaw:

Sorry that we had so much telephonic confusion in my attempt to reverse charges. It was, too, was in a "bad way" in that I was calling from The Probus Club, where policies side involv'd and was in general financial difficulties at the time.

Reason for calling was in response to a call from the Air Fo. her came to this claim, who directed me to your command. The officer with whom I talked said that I should send my "material" to your command. I explained that mailing such would be inadvisable because I did not want to disturb the state in which the "angel hair" was originally placed in, such as not to damag e it. This angel hair was found on the ground. It would not belong to an normal"method. Purpose of calling, thus, was to get your advice. 

Facts Concerning the Angel Hair:
Shortly before 5 o'clock p.m. Sept. 25, 1956, my wife, while sitting on porch with children, watched "something" white float down in front of her. While investigating the material, she noticed that another smaller tuft of the substance falling, also landing on her property.

In its original state the larger specimen lay flat looking like strands of white asbestos fibre. Its size, flattened, was about 3" x 5". 

When she touched the sensitive substance, she said it

Con't 
seemed to curl.  She then gathered the substance on a stick 
and put it in an air tight jar. In so doing, a gelatinous string 
was drawn out, which upon drying, became a bulk of the 
bacon-appearing fibre-hung pendant in the glass jar.
A second and smaller specimen, was collected on a pencil.
This we left exposed to the air.
I told my wife not to disturb the state in which she first de-
posited the substance.  For this reason I believe mailing is
not advisable.
Of course, the substance may be worthless, but it does seem 
similar to other specimens I have seen, reputed to be "angel
hair," and to other specimens I have seen in photographs.
I would like to make a chemical analysis of this substance, 
but shall wait until I hear from either you or Capt. Gregory.

Respectfully yours,

Subjects Object reported as UFO seen on September 8, 1956 in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Summary of Report:
The object was seen by the witness, a Mrs. Thelma Ingram, at approximately 12:10 a.m. on September 8, 1956. Mrs. Ingram was parked on a hill near her home in Cincinnati, Ohio, when she noticed a bright light in the sky. She watched the object for about 5-10 minutes and described it as a bright, round, stationary object that appeared to be about the size of a half dollar held at arm's length. There were no other witnesses and no photographs were taken of the object. The object was later determined to be the planet Venus.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF 
Galley 81 — THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Other Varieties of Angel Hair
Several types of angel hair, not of known terrestrial origin, have been reported in industrial areas, particularly in and near cities. When the filtering system of such a factory fails to be carried away by the wind and eventually disappears, its base may be found to have characteristics differing from the normal industrial waste. Some types of angel hair, especially if the residues break and disappear, can in particular be mistaken for by-products of industrial processes. Scientists at this and other centers can often determine with ATIC, in identifying unknown substances, that they are of unearthly origin.
Late in the afternoon of September 25, 1956, a housewife in Cincinnati, Mrs. Bertha B., told news reporters that while she was in her yard, she had found some angel hair. She described the hair as white, filmy, and diaphanous, with fibers about the diameter of a human hair. When she touched it, it disintegrated and blew away. Mrs. B. collected some of the remains and sent it to the Air Force for analysis. ATIC investigated the material and identified it as waste products from a local industrial plant.

Project Blue Book Report No. 23
Date: September 12, 1956  
Location: Cincinnati, Ohio
Subject: Report of Unidentified Aerial Objects

1. The reporting of this case was made through the telephone by Mr. ------- on 12 September 1956. The call was received at the Cincinnati Air Route Traffic Control Center.

2. The caller stated that while he was driving on Route 50 near Cincinnati, Ohio, on 7 September 1956, he observed an unusual formation of bright lights in the sky. He was able to observe three circular objects which were flying in formation at a high rate of speed. The objects were emitting brilliant white lights and were observed for approximately two minutes before disappearing from view.

3. The caller stated that the objects were similar to those described in prior unidentified aerial object reports, and he felt that this sighting was important enough to report to the proper authorities. 

4. It is requested that this report be handled in accordance with Air Technical Intelligence Center instructions. 

5. As of this date, no further information has been received from the reporting individual, and no investigation has been conducted regarding this incident.

G. DISCUSSION (CONT'D):

1. SHOWN OF INDIVIDUALS VIEWS:

a. ...
b. ...
c. Lawyer's personal records.

2. The reported sighting occurred at approximately 9:30 P.M. on October 7, 1956 in Cincinnati, Ohio. The incident was witnessed.

a. is known as "Wendell-ville". This suburb is approximately 21 miles from the downtown area of Cincinnati. It carries a population...

b. in the course of Cincinnati, in what is known as "Winton Place". This community has approximately 12,000 population.

c. A case of explanation is necessary here. In his possession a small triangular-shaped object could have been just a product of his imagination which in some way could be distorted into what he thought was a flying saucer. A daily transfer or removal of the object upon daylight arrival could explain his sighting as he was anxious to impress his neighbors.

3. Mr. - discussed the situation (and my findings) late in his home, and informed me that he was trying to impress those in his community... trying to indicate that he was very security conscious... I told him no classified items or information was involved in this investigation.

To conclude, this investigation involved no classified items or information. I told him so proceed openly. I have asked several leading questions, but see no reason to AFTIC the case. There were no other witnesses located, and I found no evidence to substantiate the sighting. There was no air force personnel involved, and the individual was simply overanxious and trying to impress his neighbors. Other than personal calls, I have nothing further for him.

6. DISCUSSION (Cont.):
As I have previously informed the subjects of my interview, when people come to me with subjects of this kind, I usually refer them to the Air Force for official action. They have immediate access to the official channels and have facilities at their disposal which I do not possess. In this particular case, however, I was informed that the sighting had been reported to the Air Force and that no satisfactory explanation had been obtained. For this reason, and also because Mr. Angell-to whose courtesy I am indebted - was desirous that I should make a further inquiry into the matter, I agreed to do so.
The incident occurred on the night of June 23, 1956, at approximately 2000 hours Eastern Daylight Saving Time, 8 miles south of Cincinnati, Ohio. The weather was clear, with visibility estimated at 10 to 15 miles. The object or objects observed were white in color, and moved in a horizontal path across the sky in a northerly direction, at an estimated elevation of 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon. The object or objects appeared to be luminous, and traveled at an estimated speed of 1000 to 1200 miles per hour. The sighting lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
12. All witnesses reaffirmed the procurement of the specimens and other documentary evidence retained by the investigator.
13. It is understood did not engage in, nor forced into, any discussions on the Air Force position or approach to the UFO controversy which could be used to the detriment of the Air Force of ATIC.
4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
14. None. Return of the "analysis and identity" of the specimens will dictate the action necessary.

Rough DRAFT

Cincinnati 27, Ohio
Dear Sir,

The material which you submitted to us will on 12 October 1955 for study and analysis is herewith returned.

A thorough, critical analysis has been carried out on the material submitted, and some identification of the material fragaents, and some classification of the physical characteristics of the material.

The results of an analysis of this material which, incidentally or by implication, you appear to be of some extra-terrestrial origin, as in the case of the "metal fragments" included from a "flying saucer", is summarized as follows:

a. All material submitted is "man-made" or "man-fabricated."
b. Samples were examined microscopically, chemically and spectrographically.
c. None samples:
All four samples were found to be ferrous-chromium and magnetic and not radioactive. The composition obtained for these samples was:
Chromium 6 - 7% 
Nickel 0.4 - 0.6%
Fe. Co. 3 N
Mn. Si. 0.5 All

The crystalline structure and non-oxidized condition of these samples points directly to the fact that a high-temperature such as would be encountered by one of current origin has not been imparted. Both the coarse appearance and the analysis of these samples strongly suggest that they have come from the site of either a small mill or steel foundry where calcium in this form is customarily added to steel melts.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or letter discussing a textile sample that was reported to be "angel-hair" - a material associated with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) at the time. The text describes the characteristics of the material and cautions against carrying it or spreading the impression that its origin was other than normal. The document is signed at the bottom.

a. Textile sample: 
The sample purported to be "angel-hair," reportedly a visible by-product of the "fuel used in flying saucers," is given both chemical and microscopic tests and is, without doubt, "a nitrogen-bearing polyamide resin," which is more commonly called "Bomex's Rayons" in the U.S. This material, after exposure to air for 72 hours in the material's frame, did not volatilize. Care is to be used by investigators or others who may be exposed to the atmosphere by certain manufacturers of the textile industry, in this case, anyone.

We are not pressed for an explanation as to what the substance or indications were leading you to believe that this material was so-called "angel-hair." We should like to comment on your statement that it would appear foolish for anyone (your source, in this case) to carry almost two pounds of metal to a gravel pit, supposedly to give the specimen some impression that its origin was other than normal. It may interest you to know that our files contain a large number of cases indicating that the investigators' efforts and seemingly clever means have resulted in attempts to create such impressions.

We are certain that you will agree with us that 'elaborate' attempts at fabrication and hoaxes result in a needless loss of government time, money, and effort. Not to say the taxpayer's money.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
