SUMMARY (Give substance of report. Give destination to first endorsement paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Specify if report is AF Form 112 - Part I(b))

1. Unidentified Flying Objects were observed on radar by personnel of Detachment "2" 7397th ACOM Squadron. The return varied in shape from a V shape to a shape to B shape, it faded after several minutes of observation.

2. It is the opinion of electronics personnel in this Division that such a return might have been caused by:
a. Anomalous Propagation
b. Ship-Borne radar Jamming Detachment "2" radar
c. Gases or Stokes in Flight.

3. Logical deduction is that one of above mentioned possibilities is the cause for this radar return.
