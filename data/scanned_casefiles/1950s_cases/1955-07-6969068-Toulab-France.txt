10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Found light, reddish-orange obj at first changing to a brilliatin white. No sound or trail when first sighted. It was ascending. It continued up, made an arc to left and descended to approx even alt. Obj with observers /ac and stopped suspended in midair. Obj then started lateral movements from left to right, just like a pendulum of a clock, but moved further to right than left, resulting in its crossing the flt path x of observers a/c. Obj also slowly increased in Alt. The obj faded from view in approx 19 min.
