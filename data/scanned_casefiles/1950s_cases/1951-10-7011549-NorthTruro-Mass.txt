EVALUATION: INSUFFICIENT DATA.

This sighting occurred about 8 hours later than the other sighting (same report number) with all conditions similar except for time, duration of track, and direction of the track. The temperature and altitude information are the same, indicating no temperature inversion. It would be unlikely that two meteors or trails would be observed the same day, and 4 minutes seems too long for this type of target. There isn't sufficient data regarding the track direction, range, changes, etc., to enable a meaningful evaluation to be made.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Radar Report, SIG CASE FILE
EVALUATION... INSUFFICIENT DATA

The weather information does not support temperature-inverted anomalous propagation. There probably are other discrepancies in the upper atmosphere which could also cause anomalous propagation. The possibility that meteors entered the atmosphere and were detected cannot be disregarded, and may be the answer to this report. A meteor would cause increased target detectability. Short duration of the condition supports this theory, rather than anomalous propagation.

AF 47-516

This sighting occurred about 5 hours later than the other sighting (same report number) - with all conditions similar except for time, duration of tracking, and direction at the track.

The temperature and altitude information are the same, indicating no temperature inversion. It would be unlikely that two meteor trails would be observed the same day and 4 minutes seems to long for this type of target.

There just sufficient data regarding the track direction, range, charges, etc. to enable a meaningful evaluation to be made.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give intelligence in first one or two sentences. List indications of lower left. Physical details of report on AF Form 112 - Part II)

On 22 October 1951, the radar station, located at North Truro, Massachusetts observed an unusual sighting on its radar scopes, at a location approximately 120 to 330 miles away. The individual scope returns, and the subsequent photo-electronic survey. Details are listed on Part II, this report. These individual scope returns, while probably unidentifiable, indicate the appearance of a "pick-ups" may actually have been that of an unidentified flying object, rather than some type of radar interference or atmospheric.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Group)    REPORT NO.
D/F 7146        TR-17-518

In compliance with provisions of ADC Letter No 200-J, "Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft", 21 April 1951, Reference: Subparagraph 5b Chg 50 Chanute, 5th Allowing: detailed report, as required in Subparagraph 5a(2) thereof, on unusual sighting, on its major scopes, by a station located at North Truro, Massachusetts.

(a) Description of object: Radians indicated a characteristic "Damage shape", in which the dimension in range is smaller than the dimension in azimuth. Lights on the screen were dim, faint, and the object was appreciably strong; these two characteristics are typical of any radar return of an unusual or "light" object. Possibly the object being flying object was the extreme range of final pick-up. Scope would be streamlined.

(b) Time of sighting: From 22-0145 to 22-0222, for duration of four (4) minutes. Estimated speed: approximately 1000 knots.

(c) Manner of observation: by radar "scope", on Plan Position Indicator (PPI), CPS-5A radar set, on 24 July and 30th August 1951, located at North Truro, Massachusetts. Observation from surface station.

(d) Location of observer: Station located at 12002'N 70°30', Single object observed from track, from 12002'N 70°30' to 12002'N 70°30', at an unknown altitude, at locations approximately 120 to 300 miles east, NNE, and ENE of station. Tracking done using observation pictures. Course: approx NNE.

(e) Identification of observer: Radar station. Reliability: normal. Estimate of reliability and experience: unknown.

(f) Weather conditions at time of sighting: clear, visibility: 15 miles; temperature: 55 degrees F.

(g) Other factors which might account for phenomenon: Nothing definitive. However, the suggested 10-15 Norember, each year, may be a possible causes (?) possible meteor trail noted. Scope, the 12 to 15 return, 1951, no meteorological phenomena in evidence, however, to indicate other. The possibility remains that the object may have been an unconventional flying object.

(h) No physical evidence exists of the observation. Object was above ocean.

(i) No identification or interception procedures were undertaken.

(j) Local aircraft airborne at time of sighting: no information available.

The weather information does not support temperature-inverted anomalous propagation. There probably are other discrepancies in the upper atmosphere which could also cause anomalous propagation.

The possibility that meteors entered the atmosphere and were detected cannot be disregarded, and may be the answer to this report. A meteor would cause ionization of the air which should increase the target detectability. Short duration of the condition supports this theory, rather than anomalous propagation.

The weather information does not support temperature anomalous convection propagation. There probably are other discrepancies in the upper atmosphere which could also cause anomalous propagation.

The possibility that meteor central the at might here and were detected cannot be disregarded, and may be the answer to this report. A meteor would cause ionization of the air which should increase the target detectability. That deviation of the condition supports this theory rather than constant propagation.

1. In compliance with AMC Letter 200-1, dated 11 April 1951, Subject: Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft, the following report is submitted:

a. Manner of observation: Radar pickup on Plan Position Indicator of CPS-5B radar at North Truro, Massachusetts.

b. Time and place of sighting: 12306 to 12322, 22 October 1951, from 46°09'N - 69°05'W - 42°00'N.

c. Location of observer (CPS-5B radar): 70°03'N - 42°00'W.

d. Length of time object was observed: Two (2) minutes.

e. Number of objects: One; course: West, then South; altitude unknown; speed: 2400 Knots.

f. Weather conditions at time of sighting: Clouds - 14,000', scattered; visibility - 15 miles; temperature - 42°.

g. Radar frequency: 2972 and 3014 Megacycles.

h. Probable identity of target: Unknown.

i. No interception or identification action was taken.

j. The individual echo returns and the appearance of the track substantiated the probability of these radar pickups actually being of a flying object rather than some kind of radar characteristics or malfunction. The individual returns were of the characteristic elongated shape in which the dimension in range is smaller than the dimension in azimuth. The returns were weak and few in number to preclude any appreciable strong, both of which are characteristic of any aircraft radar return.

the station the strength of the individual echo returns decreased early. A phenomenon common to all highly scattered aircraft. This track faded at a distance of 30 miles north of the station. Whether it faded because it plunged into the water or whether it faded because of flying at an extremely high altitude is unknown.
