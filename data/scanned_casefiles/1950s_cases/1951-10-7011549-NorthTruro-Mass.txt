EVALUATION. 1: INSUFFICIENT DATA
The weather information does not support temperature-inverted anomalous propagation. There probably are other discrepancies in the upper atmosphere which could also cause anomalous propagation. The possibility that meteors entered the atmosphere and were detected cannot be disregarded, and may be the answer to this report. A meteor would cause ionization of the air which should increase the target detectability. Short duration of the condition supports this theory, rather than anomalous propagation.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List Incloures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112 Part II):

On 22 October 1951, the radar station, located at North Truro, Massachusetts observed an unusual sighting on its radar scopes, at a location approximately 120 to 300 miles East and East-North-East away. Details are listed on Part II, this report. The individual echo returns, and the appearance of the track, substantiate the probability that these radar "pick-ups" may actually have been that of an unidentified flying object, rather than some type of radar interference or malfunction.

In compliance with provisions of AUC Letter No 200-1, "Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft", 11 April 1951, reference: sub-paragraph Sb thereof, the following detailed report, as required in sub-paragraph 5b(1) thereof, is submitted,
concerning an unusual sighting, on its radar scopes, by a station located at North Truro, Massachusetts.

(a) Description of object: Returns indicated a characteristic "sausage shape", in which the dimension in range is smaller than the dimension in azimuth. Amplitude of the return varied from radar "pick-up" to "pick-up" and was never apparently strong; 
These two characteristics are typical of any radar return of an aircraft or flying object. Possible prediction of the object being flying object was the extreme range of final pickup. Normally, a flying object capable of indicated speed (references below)
Would be streamlined.

(b) Time of sighting: From 22-0128Z to 22-0222Z, for duration of four (4) minutes. Estimated speed: approximately 1,000 knots.

(c) Manner of observation: By radar "pick up" on Plan Position Indicator (PPI) radar set, on frequencies of 2992 and 3011 megacycles, by station at Nort Truro, Massachusetts,Observation from surface station.

(d) Location of observer: Station located at 42028'W; 7003'W. Single object observed along track, from 34010'6 5310' to 141010; 653 ", an unknown alt-
cade, at location approximately 120 to 300 miles East, ESE, and ENE of
observer. Approximate observation pickups. Course: approx 265E.


Identiification of observer: Radar station. Reliability: normal, Estimate of reliability and experience: unknown.

(e) Weather conditions at time of sighting: clear, visibility: 15 miles, Temperature: 35 degrees F.

(g) Other factors which might account for phenomenon: Nothing definite. How-ever, the suggestion is offered that: (1) annual "shower" of meteors, normally due 12-15 November, each year, may be a possible cause; (2) pos- sible meteor "burn front" 
  course, due to return near the Earth, October, 1951. No meteorological phenomena in evidence, however, to indicate either.
  The possibility remains that the object may have been an unconventional flying object.

(h) No physical evidence exists of the observation. Object was above ocean.

(i) No identification or interception procedures were undertaken.

(j) Local aircraft airborne at time of sightings: No information available.

The weather information does not
support temperature-invers-ed anomalous
propagation. There probably are other
discrepancies in the upper atmosphere 
which could also cause anomalous 
propagation.

The possibility that meteors entered
the atmosphere and were detected 
cannot be disregarded, and may be
the answer to this report. A meteor 
would cause ionization of the air 
which would increase the target detectability. 
Short duration of the condition support this theory, 
rather than anomalous propagation.

1.  In compliance with AMC Letter 200-1, dated 11 April 1951, Subject: Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft, the following report is submitted.

a. Manner of observation: Radar pickup on Plan Position Indicator of CPS-6B radar at North Truro, Massachusetts.

b. Time and place of sighting: 1200Z to 1222Z, 22 October 1951, from 6805N - 45*05'W to 70*05'W - 42*01'N.

c. Location of observer (CPS-6B radar): 70*03'W - 42*01'N.

d. Length of time object was observed: Two (2) minutes.

e. Number of objects: One; course: West, then South; altitude unknown; speed: 2400 knots.

f. Weather conditions at time of sighting: Clouds - 11/00; scattered; visibility - 15 miles; temperature - 42°.

g. Radar frequency: 2992 and 5014 megacycles.

h. Probable identity of target: Unknown.

i. No interception or identification action was taken.

2. The individual echo returns and the appearance of the track substantiated the probability of these radar pickings actually being of a flying object rather than some kind of radar interference or malfunction. The individual returns were of the characteristic sausage shape in which the dimension in range is smaller than the dimension in azimuth. The amplitude of the return varied from pickup to pickup and was never appreciably strong, both of which are characteristic of any aircraft radar return. When the tracks turned

the station the strength of the individual echo returns decreased
sharply, a phenomenon common to all highly streamlined aircrafts. This
track faded at a distance of 30 miles north of the station. Whether it
head because it plunged into the water or whether it faded because of
flying at an extremely high altitude is unknown.

Reference your inquiry on radar sightings at North Truro, Mass, on 22 Oct 51.
Subject: Correlation on Unconventional Aircraft, dated 18 Oct 1951. Please advise
as follows:

a.  Is there any radar data available from nearby USAF weather stations,
other sources known here on altitudes, heading vo el ciudad, and velocity of
aircraft?

b.  Has the target observed by any other nearby radar equipment? If so,
give details.

c.  Has anomalous propagation been observed to extend the range of ground
radar by this radar at this site; and did this condition exist during or near
the time this airborne target was observed?
