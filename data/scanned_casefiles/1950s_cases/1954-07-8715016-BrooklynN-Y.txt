15 JULY 1950

24 March 1959

Dear Mr [redacted],

Your letter of 5 March concerning unidentified flying objects, addressed to Professor J. A. Hynek, has been referred to this office for reply.

The theories advanced in your letter are most interesting. However, to date no authenticated evidence exists to support the theory that interplanetary space travel exists in reverse. Neither does evidence exist indicating the UFO phenomena to be hostile or a threat of any kind against the security of the United States. If, in your opinion, your sighting of 19 July 1954 proved to the contrary, we would be most interested in the facts surrounding this sighting.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

Dear Professor Hynek:

I cannot begin with an obvious pretention for my inclination is natural enough! I desire to approach the road dead-center, in the hope it can lead to the Inn, where Man can reside in comfort. Long ago Sir J. Arthur Thomson wrote a fine book Riddles of Science: and this I pose to you, as a Scientist, certain riddles that have appeared, albelt, since the atoms have been exploding and since we, Mankind, have been exploring the regions above our ionosphere. But kindly exculpate any of my inferences realizing, I am a self-educated man, ever seeking fruitful knowledge. (I had had High School experience and Nonmatriculating cou- in College.)

The first riddle: is the question of UFO'SI Sighted by numerous persons of creditable background. I myself had one Night Sighting in July 19fifty four: which I outlined in detail for Professor Menzel: and he admitted I had an interesting sighting: but meekly imagined it was the result of a fancied searchlight. The second sighting was a probab- Jan. twenty fourth instant! It was a daylight sighting: and a witness though unperturbed by the opinions I held, was there at the time.

The AirForce sent me about ten pages of detailed information to fill ou- of some sort. This is the first riddle.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

The second riddle is based on observation and is indirectly involved with the first. Seeing it is a fact that the UFO's are real and are not illusory phantoms of ones' imagination: which is shrinking because of the achievements already accomplished by science. It deals with the loss of our space equipment in mysterious fashion! What has happened to our flights: after their successful blast off? On several occasions it has been announced that there is no explanation for their disappearance. As in the case of the Vandenberg Bas

The explanations given are not in conformance to general knowledge. I am not satisfied, that whatever you wish to call that number, is still in orbit! If it is in orbit, are we sure that was not tampered with?

The third riddle is the sighting of a volcanic eruption on the Moon: by certain Russian astronomers: as well as sighting of colored gases or similar substances in a given area. And w this in point: it was earlier announced, that we or the Russia would hit the Moon with a death-dealing weapon! Why that part ticular means to impress the world? Can it be: the Moon is al ready a base occupied by hostile or semi-hostile groups of beings? Regard the disappearances of whole families: and cert other mysteries: that cannot be cast aside as mere tomfoolery!

I do not jest over these things: but I am seriously concerned about them! I think a man with some backbone ought to announce several things! That the UFO'S are real! And that their acti are either hostile or suspicious! Or that they have no intent of dominating the earth: by methods known only to them. To sa UFO'S do not exist and To ignore it: is a terrible disaster to the soul. What say you Sir?
