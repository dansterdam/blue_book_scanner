25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you saw, and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The shape of the object at the right was not very clear. Only faint reflections(or what I thought were reflections) of the city lights gave me the impression that it was of this shape. The fourteen lights are only a guess but in my opinion approximate.

They were not like those on ordinary aircraft but were of an unusual nature as I thought they were reflections of an internal light.

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this?
(Circle One): Yes     No

26.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
It was evidently some sort of thing that I am ignorant of. It was definitely some sort of searchlights or aircraft with dull orange lights which seemed to come from aircraft.

28. Cite the following information about yourself:

NAME
ADDRESS                     Street                City            Zone    State
