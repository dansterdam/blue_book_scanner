Please note that some parts of the text contain ambiguities due to the quality of the scan and the typical formatting of official military documents of that era. The text reflects what can be reasonably discerned from the image provided.

The image shown is a scanned page that appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. The sketch seems to depict a boomerang-shaped object with numerous circles or dots along its surface. This could be interpreted as a representation of lights or features on the object. There is no accompanying text visible in this image other than two redacted lines, one above and one below the drawing. The redacted lines are covered by black bars, preventing the reading of any text which may have been there. Since there's no visible text, I cannot provide an OCR output for this specific image.

SECTION D

22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an 
"A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon 
when you first saw it. Place a "B" to show where it was when you last saw it.

Overhead

            B
             \  
              \
Your eye       A            Horizon

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was 
when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead
            B
            |
         TREES |
            | Horizon
             O
           /   |
Your eye /_____| A            Horizon

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place 
an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

(It traveled on a slight arc)            EAST

NORTH "B"_______________________________________"A" SOUTH

                                  EYE         
                                  WEST
``` 

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the trajectory of an object with points "A" and "B" to mark the starting and ending positions above a horizontal line labeled "Horizon," with "Your eye" indicated as the observation point.

The second sketch also shows the trajectory of an object from "A" to "B," but this time the trajectory is a straight vertical line descending behind a representation of trees and the horizon, again with "Your eye" observing from the left.

The third sketch illustrates a path marked by "A" and "B," with a text note stating it traveled on a slight arc, laid out over a compass-like representation with "EAST" at the top, "WEST" at the bottom, and the end points of the arc labeled "SOUTH" and "NORTH" respectively.

- page 22 -

There is a hand-drawn illustration in the document. It depicts a shape with thirteen marks or dots lined up in a slight curve along the bottom edge. From the context, it seems to represent lights on an object seen in the sky. To its right, there is an arrow with the letter "S" next to it, indicating the direction of the object's movement.

Here is the text from the document:

Page 7

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The shape of the object at the right was what I very clear. Only faint reflections (or what they robe reflections) of the city lights gave me the impression that it was of this shape. The fourteen lights are only a guess; but in my opinion approximate.

They were not like these on ordinary aircraft but were of an in d structure as though they _____ were reflections of an internal ligh

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this? (Circle One): Yes No

26.1 If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
