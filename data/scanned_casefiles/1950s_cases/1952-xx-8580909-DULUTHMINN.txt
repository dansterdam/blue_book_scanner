GFF a blunt-nosed, dull circular shaped objects which gave off a light glow as from a filament in the center of the bottom of the objects. The objects were seen for several minutes through a telescope by the observers. The trailing objects, estimated four in number, were about the same size as the lead object. The lead object appeared to be much closer than the following objects. As the objects were approached to about one-half mile, the objects suddenly disappeared from view, there was no trail or vapor left behind, and they did not appear to go out of sight or into the haze or darkness, but simply vanished. There was no sound accompanying the sighting.
Formating, the tracking object being on the east side of the observers. Wind conditions appeared light and variable at the time. The objects did not appear to go out of sight or into the haze or darkness, but simply vanished. There was no sound accompanying the sighting.
