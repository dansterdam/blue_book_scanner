12 October 1957

MEMORANDUM FOR COMMANDER SINSHEIMER, AFR:

1. Reference "Fire Ball" of Utah. Captain Gregory states:
"The object was not the Soviet Satellite. The Soviet Satellite movement could not have fits this case as the object was stationary, attracting to its great altitude. The 1006th Air Intelligence Service Squadron investigating because of public interest this incident yesterday afternoon (10 Oct 57). Incident is similar to Van Tassel siting of 'flying saucer ship' which was identified this unit after-noon for details. The UFO is being kept informed."

Center: Lowry AFB, Colorado (10 Oct 57 - 1422) to ATIC states that this object "seems to correlate with this message: The object was round, with a tail protruding, about 200 to 300 feet long, it was stationary, hovering, made no sound and appeared to be on fire and explosions at the sky brightly. It was traveling at a high rate of speed from Southwest to Northeast, hit the ground or crashed out in 3 to 12 seconds. Observations were made by Fisher Body/Aircraft 3313,000 employees and 1000 civilians." 

East bound C-118 at 17,000 feet. Time and date of sighting was 10 October 1957 at 1740Z over Michigan. All details received second hand from junior controller at Denver control.

"Reference UFO over New York area approximately 20 September. 
Two U.S. Industrial Survey teams temporarily stopped aircraft flying operations because of UFO sighted by both teams at the same time". Commander Stewart, APD, New York, identifies the object as seen by both teams as a Soviet Satellite.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

Text output:

Could not see object, just the tail which was orange/yellow in color. Approximately one foot long. 

Northwest - Altitude estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 feet, from the West/
and faded - Observed for three minutes. Went up and then angled downward

Time of observation was on the 28th of August at 2355z to 2358z.

The second sighting in September was reported by the Commander, 26th Air Division Intelligence Group, from Westover AFB, and was considered by them to be an upper atmosphere balloon.

COMMENT: Many cases are reported exclusively to the press, the AF having no knowledge until the groups hits the press bills. We do not have cognizance of any sighting not reported to us.

3 October 1957, a TWX was sent to ATIC-111 requesting any photographs of unidentified flying objects. In addition, a letter was sent on 5 November 1957 to each base requesting either photographs or information. There have been no results to date.
