MEMORANDUM FOR COLONEL WATSON SUPT

1. Reference "Fire Ball" of Utah, Captain Gregory states:

"The object was not the Soviet Satellite. The Soviet Satellite was near South Africa at that time and this object was seen simultaneously from widely separated areas, attesting to its great altitude. The 1006th Air Intelligence Service Squadron is investigating because of public concern. Investigators arrived at Miton, Utah area late yesterday afternoon (10 Oct 57). Incident is similar to Pan American Airways case, which was identified this unit as a "Fire Ball". The Chief, OSI, is coming in this afternoon for details. The FRO is being kept informed."

Data on "Fire Ball": Official message from Lowry Flight Service Center, Lowry AFB, Colorado (10 Oct - 1432) to ATIC, states that this object "was probably a meteoric." The following descriptive data was included in this message: The object was round with a tail 200 to 300 yards long, flaming, made hissing noises which, together with explosions, were heard from the ground. Parts of material were seen falling off. The flame and explosions lit the sky brightly. It was traveling on the course of West/Southeast. Descent was estimated at an angle of 030 degrees to falling rapidly. It either hit the ground or burned out in 6 to 12 seconds. Observation were made by three B-47 aircraft at 33,000, 35,000, and 37,000 feet respectively, one Westbound airliner, altitude unknown, and one Eastbound C-118 at 17,000 feet. Time and date of sighting was 091042 to 091107Z at night. Area of sighting was Grandville, Michigan, and Kalton, Utah. Identifying information of all observers and all reports received second hand from Senior Controller at Denver Control. Reliability estimated good, particularly on air sightings. Weather was clear to high scattered clouds and broken at the surface. Wind was from the West/Northeast, varying from 5 to 35 knots. Weather Station said comet was supposed to be in area. All reports compare very well.

2. Reference UFO over New York area approximately 20 September: Two official reports available to Captain Gregory were received (3 September and 20 September 1957). The 3 September 1957 report, from Commander, Stewart AFB, New York, identifies the object seen by Mrs. housewife, as most probably Comet "MRKOS", which had been in view for the past several nights from area of observation.

Description of object as follows:


- page 6 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

a. Could not see object, just the tail which was orange/yellow in color, approximately one foot long.

b. Altitude estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 feet, from the West/Northwest.

c. Observed for three minutes. Went up and then arced downward and faded.

d. Time of observation was on the 28th of August at 2350Z to 2352 at dusk.

The second sighting in September was reported by the Commander, 26th Air Division, Roslyn AFS, Roslyn, New York and was considered by the Air Division Intelligance Service to probably be a weather balloon. It was observed by Francis McNeill of Long Island, New York, a former JFIU gunner on an aircraft carrier.

a. Round, twice the size of a basketball at arm's length, shiny, silver or gray, looked like a balloon but the speed of departure was unusual.

b. He observed it for approximately three minutes from the ground, the 19th of September at 1905Z. The object moved slowly at first, then suddenly moved Northwest very rapidly.

c. The weather at time of observation was clear, surface wind South/Southeast, 10 knots, increasing to 34 knots at 54,000 feet from the Northwest.

COMMENT: Many cases are reported exclusively to the press, the AF having no knowledge until the press hits it. We do not take cognizance of any sighting not reported to us.

3. Reference Soviet Reconnaissance Aircraft over 6th Fleet: On 3 October 1957, a TWX was sent to AFOIN-1A1 requesting any photographs or information available on this aircraft. In addition, Mr. Carver of AFOIN-4/F2, had his Naval Reserve Command write directions to ONI requesting either photographs or information. There have been no results to date.
