1. On the night of 11 September 1958, source - a USAF Officer - observed the following activity of searchlights and unidentified flying objects or projectiles on the USSR/Turk border. Refer to page 2 for pinpoint location.

a. At 2315 hours on 11 September 1958 source observed, from the deck of a surface vessel approaching the Port of HOPA, Turkey, searchlights and an unidentified object or projectile leave the ground from the searchlight area. Processed out over the water at an elevation of approximately 300'. As the object left the ground it separated into a cluster of six bright red fireball objects.

Set 1/1, Card 2/2

USSR

The objects were visible for approximately four seconds, then disappeared. The effect was similar to fireworks displayed at Fourth or July celebrations. There were three series of these objects observed at 30-second intervals, beginning at 2315 hours. No other objects were observed until 2345 hours, (2145Z) at which time only one cluster was seen another cluster was seen at 2350 hours.

b. All observations were unrestrictied as they were made over water. Source did not see nor hear aircraft in flight during their operation. The weather was clear and there was no moon.

c. During the time the objects were observed the searchlights were being directed intermittently southeast and horizontally between water and land.

2. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: Since 1 July 1958, this is the seventh trip source has made to this location arriving by surface vessel. Possible at the same hour on each visit. While searchlights have been observed previously, this is the first occasion on which source observed this phenomenon.
