SUBJECT: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft.

1. One object; unusually bright and a brilliant white; appeared to be three or four times, as large as a star; as object ascended it appeared to change in color to a hazy yellow - green - red and left tail of light behind; no sound; appeared to have tremendous rate of speed, as well as a pattern of flight, although it would zig zag in an abrupt fashion. Observer stated object did not appear to be conventional aircraft and in his judgment displayed convincing traits of plannedness renewability, which discounted theory of its being a balloon.

2. Observation made on 12 January 1951, approximately 2200 EST.
