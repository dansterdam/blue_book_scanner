SUMMARY:

On 16 April 1952, Cpt John R W Cambell, senior controller on duty, received a call from 176th Fighter Squadron Operations, Truax Field, Madison, Wisconsin, that a Mr.  had observed 5 or 6 objects in the sky, almost straight up and slightly to the east. The time: 20:15 CST. They were semi-circular in shape and formation, glowing with a yellowish - white light. Neither ground nor exhaust was noted. They were on a heading of approximately 090° traveling at a high rate of speed; altitude not determined.

After a few seconds the object(s) made a sharp left turn in a North NW direction and gained altitude rapidly, as they disappeared the lights seemed to fuse or come together.

The sighting was verified by his friend, Mr. . Both observations were made by the naked eye.

At the time Capt Cambell received the call (20:25) our radar station A1/CPS-6B was off temporarily due to preventive maintenance, but Capt Cambell brought it operational in about three minutes to obtain radar observation, with negative results. There were some F-80 type aircraft in the vicinity which he directed to investigate, with no results. He then took a flight of F-86 'type aircraft at 30,000 ft over area; shift de nothing.

The weather by teletype was: VHB, clear and better than 15 miles visibility, temp 53°, dew point 35°, wind WNW at 4 MPH, barometric pressure 30.22.

A check with the local airlines placed a Northwest Airlines Flight 423, of that date, enroute from Chicago to Minneapolis, Over Loina Rock, Wisconsin at 20:05 CST, and again by LaCrosse, Wisconsin at 20:30 CST, therefore this flight could not have been the object sighted. No other airline flights in the vicinity.

In checking with the Yerkes Observatory, Williams Bay, Wisconsin, and with the Washburn Observatory at the University of Wisconsin, Madison for any meteorological display, there was nothing unusual recorded.

APPENDIX VI

Madison, Wisconsin - 16 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

This incident is cited not so much because it is outstanding but because of the excellent attempt at identifying the object by ADC units.

2015 CST: Civilian telephoned fighter operations of Truax Field to report that he had just sighted a formation of yellowish-white lights traveling at a high rate of speed on a heading of 90°.

2020 CST: Fighter operations called AC and W Squadron. The radar was closed down for preventive maintenance but was operational within three minutes. A flight of F-80s were directed to investigate and returned with negative results. A flight of F-86s were sent to 30,000 ft., also returned with negative results.

In addition to the AC and W Squadron Intelligence Officer checked all airline flights and checked two observatories for any unusual astronomical displays. Results were negative.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

It is possible that the observer saw either the F-80s or F-86s over Madison, since they were in the area, however, the source reported no sounds. The objects were also reported to have turned very sharply and climbed at a high rate of speed. Jet aircraft far enough away not to be heard would normally not appear to make a sharp turn and fast climb.

III. CONCLUSIONS

Source possibly observed jet aircraft in area and the apparent high speed and rate of climb was an illusion.
