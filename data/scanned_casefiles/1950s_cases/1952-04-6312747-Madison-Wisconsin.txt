Report of Unusual Flying Objects

Vicinity of Madison, Wisconsin

AND Ltr, 390-1, dated 11 April 1951

SUMMARY: (Under concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures as below. Begin text of report on AF Form 112—Part III)

On 16 April 1952, Capt R W Campbell, senior controller on duty, received a call from 1769th Flight Squadron Operations, Truax Field, Madison, Wisconsin, that a Mr. [redacted] had observed 5 or 6 objects in the sky, almost straight up and slightly to the west. The time was approximately 1630 CST. They were semi-circular in shape and formation, flowing with a yellowish - white light. Neither sound nor exhaust was noted. They were on a heading of approximately 070 traveling at a high rate of speed; altitude not determined.

After a few seconds the object(s) made a sharp left turn in a North NW direction and remained almost stationary, as they disappeared in lights as near to fuse or come together.

The sighting was verified by his friend, Mr. [redacted]. Both observations were made by the naked eye.

At the time Capt Campbell received the call (021252) our radar station AW/CPS was off 1 temporarily due to preventive maintenance, but Capt Campbell brought it operational in about three minutes to obtain radar observation, with negative results. There were some F-80 type aircraft in the vicinity which he directed to investigate, with no results. He then took a flight of F-86 type aircraft at 30,000 ft over area, also nothing.

The weather by teletype was WNW, clear and better than 15 miles visibility, temp 58°, dew point 58°, wind WNW at 4 MPH, barometric pressure 30.22.

A check with the local airlines placed a Northwest Airlines Flight 425, of that date, enroute from Chicago to Minneapolis, Over Lou Pock, Wisconsin at 1900 CST, and again by Ladore, WI near CST, checked that the flight could not have been the object sighted. No other airline flights in the vicinity.

In checking with the Yerkes Observatory, Williams Bay, Wisconsin, and with the Washburn Observatory at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, for any meteorological display, there was nothing unusual recorded.

APPENDIX VI

Madison, Wisconsin - 16 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
This incident is cited not so much because it is outstanding but because of the excellent attempt at identifying the object by ADC units.

2015 CST: Civilian telephoned fighter operations of Traux Field to report that he had just sighted a formation of yellowish-white lights traveling at a high rate of speed on a heading of 90°.

2020 CST: Fighter operations called ADC and W Squadron. The radar was closed down for preventive maintenance but was operational within three minutes. A flight of F-80's were directed to investigate and returned with negative results. A flight of F-86's were sent to 30,000 ft., also returned with negative results.

In addition to this the AC and W Squadron Intelligence Officer checked all airline flights and checked two observatories for any unusual astronomical displays. Results were negative.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
It is possible that the observer saw either the F-80's or F-86's over Madison, since they were in the area, however, the source reported no sounds. The objects were also reported to have turned very sharply and climbed at a high rate of speed. Jet aircraft far enough away not to be heard would normally not appear to make a sharp turn and fast climb.

III. CONCLUSIONS
Source possibly observed jet aircraft in area and the apparent high speed and rate of climb was an illusion.
