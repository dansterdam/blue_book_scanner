The text reads as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 23 Sep 52
2. LOCATION: Tsu Shima, Japan
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2035
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: Yes
6. SOURCE: military
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 hr 34 minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Several
9. COURSE: Unknown
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: On two separate outbound tracks from Iruuma AFB, a series of targets appeared directly behind the aircraft, which entering an azimuth of 050° to 070° in relation to COURSE, SPEED, OBJECTS appeared as a normal a/c, but rounder in shape with a trace and trailed approx 2-3 miles to rear of a/c.
11. COMMENTS: D/I FEAT COMMENT - The presentation appears to be due to atmosphere changes caused by passage of the target a/c through this particular area, resulting in ionization and extraneous echoes.

The image contains a photograph, which shows an illustration/sketch of an object in the sky. The sketch includes labeled details about the object's shape and motion.

Text from the document:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead

Horizon You Horizon

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.
Looking North
white object
moved in NorthWest
at Northwest course

The object was not in a distinct or sharply defined motion, but rather moved in a northerly course.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include shape: a short boat-shaped or cigar-shaped rear: sharply pointed, with a dome-shaped body: indistinct or obscure in details, but seems to emanate a stronger bright or low.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

Question 20: The attitude I judged roughly to be at first 50 to 75 miles. However, the object could have been considerably farther. The speed was usually very slow. I am reasonably sure it moved forward no more than two half-dollar lengths which appeared at full view for several seconds.

Question 18: While the object moved forward, the body rolled or listed, completing this performance, behind a semi-permanent obscuration. This appeared to be a region of space that concealed the lower portion of the object. At the same time, the visible portion was sharply defined, suggesting the concealment was not caused by fog, dust, etc. The visible contour remained consistent and uniform throughput its visible portion.

Remarks: No meteors or aircraft were observed during the sighting. The sun had no effect. The object caused a reflection. The case was investigated but search operations to find any physical evidence of the object were negative.

SECURITY INFORMATION
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
ISSUING AGENCIES: Intelligence Office, 529th Air Defense Group, APO 929
DATE: 6 SEP 1952
SUBJECT: Unusual Radar Condition, Tsushima, Japan

At approximately 2050I on the 28 Sep 52, A/3c Hall called me into the scope room to see an unusual radar condition. At 2052I the target was picked up on the radar scope and was tracked to 2054I, when it passed off the scope. The target appeared to be at 30,000 feet and was observed for a period of approximately 2 minutes. It was plotted on the scope and showed this same condition. The target was observed to travel at a speed of approximately 1,500 MPH, which is too fast for any aircraft known to be operating in that area and did not show this condition.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an Air Intelligence Information Report with the title "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT". The text in the document discusses the presentation of an unspecified object and suggests that the presentation is due to atmospheric changes caused by the passage of large aircraft through the area.
