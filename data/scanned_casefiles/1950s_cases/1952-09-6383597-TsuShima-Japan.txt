10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
On two specific outbound tracks from Itazuke AB, a series of targets appeared directly behind the aircraft when entering an azimuth of 050° to 070° in relation to TSUSU, SAKI. Objects appeared as a normal a/c, but rounder in shape with a trace and trailed approx 2-3 miles to rear of a/c.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon

☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other
☑ Insufficient Data for Evaluation

11. COMMENTS
D/1 FEAF COMMENT - The presentation appears to be due to atmosphere changes caused by passage of the target a/c through this particular area, resulting in ionization and extraneous echoes.

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

[Diagram of overhead view with horizon and "You" labeled]

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

Looking North
while object
moved in Northerly
or Northwesterly
course.

[Diagram of object's path]

The object was not
in descent as this
drawing suggests...
rather it shows its
Northerly course.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Shape: squat boat-shaped or lemon-shaped
Front: acuminate
Rear: slightly tapered, tip blunted and compressed
Body: compressed or ribbed, which seemed to emanate stronger burst / glow.

Note: See page 8 for performance
and disappearance.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

Question #20: The altitude I judged roughly to be at first 50 to 75 miles. However, the object could have been considerably lower than this estimate.

The speed was usually, very slow. I am reasonably sure it moved forward no more than two half-dollar lengths which required a full minute.

The estimated size of the object: a half dollar coin, held at arm's length. The object impressed me as being tremendous in size, possibly more than 1500 ft. in length: 1000 ft. in width.

Question #18: While object moved forward, the body rolled or listed. Completing the performance, its front portion passed through, on behind what seemed an invisible curtain. As the swallows of the entire lighted mass. As the object passed, there certain the visible portion of the still spiraled contour remained constant and stabilized.

Remarks: No meteors or aircraft were observed during the site. No balloons were in the area. Visibility was good. The sun had not risen. The object appeared self-luminous. The sky was intensely black in the eastern and western portion. Stars were out in fullest extent and western, while object seemed only half as brilliant.

at 2035E 28 Sep 52 I was scope operator for this detachment.
A outbound track from Itazuke AFB on entering the area 050 to 
C70 had a series of targets appearing then main carrier. Another 
outbound track at 2041I showed this same condition. I called A/2c 
Grovenstein to the scope and a target at 2052I did the same thing.
I left A/2c Grovenstein at the scope and went to report the occurrence to the Detachment Commander and ADCC. The scope was normal with little clutter. Two tracks during this time went thru 
the safe area and did not show this condition.

At approximately 2052I on the 28 Sep 52 A/3c Hall called me into the scope room and saw a unusual radar condition. At 2052I a target outbound from Itazuke had three targets appear behind it at an azimuth of 055. For about 10 sweeps this condition remained. Then at 2196I and 2209I this occurred again. Several tracks in between did not show this occurrence. Scope was normal with minor sea clutter and usual PPI.
