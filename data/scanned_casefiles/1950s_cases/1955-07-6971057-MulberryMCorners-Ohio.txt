Case File Number Two

Case File Number One and this one were grouped in an effort to substantiate Case File Number Three, which is in reference to a file which was based on a report of UFO's seen by Mr. and Mrs. ******* of ********* Ohio. For reasons of evaluation we would have to have some evidence to back it up. When we started our investigations, we were most skeptical as you have and will see, there is much corroboration and documentation of evidence here, proving we considered our search to determine what we did turn up--evidence which supports the findings. The names in this file have been changed--the reasons we change them are obvious. This file involves the experience of Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby, of Ohio.

Radio-Television Shows on the investigation of sightings, and the R-D-- are we have extensive accounts and reports, correspondents from various media thoroughly document their story--it stood out Here is the story:

"Written Dec. 23, 1955. To Whom It May Concern:--
One night in late July, or early in August, 1955 I closed my television shop and proceeded to go home. I had a journey of about 1/4 of a mile to walk across the road to get the mail. This was a very cloudy and dark early morning. As I reached up to open the mailbox, I saw this red light which seemed to swing above me at an angle. I could see the outlines of the thing and it appeared to be a transport plane but with no motors. It was so big it looked like a transport plane but could hear no motors.

The second or two I stood there, it flashed through my mind that this big plane was going to crash. The whole thing was illuminated with a brilliant white light. These craft were in a vertical beam or directly toward the ground. Then I got scared and ran back across the road and past my car. I did not stop to get in it. It would not crash! I realized it was a big red thing. The way it would dip back and forth with this little dance was peculiar. One blink, it would be gone, and the next blink it would be there. At one time the thing was right over me, It frightened me so that I ran in my house and told my wife. "Hell, no don't turn on any lights." This thing was still hovering there. After a few minutes it seemed to take off slowly and silently like nothing I had ever seen before. All there crying "what is it? Daddy, what is it?" (This detail shows over the passage about 50 to 100 feet off of the ground-hovering there-not moving. I could not move or run this thing was right over the house.)

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document.

More than once Mr. took UFOD investigators out into the field and described the sightings of the unidentified flying objects pointing out land marks, etc. He is thoroughly familiar with the physical characteristics observed during the sightings. He state: "This thing was almost round with a dome on it! I've never seen anything like it."

Investigation revealed from a Coll. Rural in the area that two ball-bearing doughnut-shaped objects were seen to emerge from clouds over there, were out after dark some night after August 22, 1955 and that they might have caused the other sightings. However, the Shoenman's were positive (1) that the event happened in late July or early August because that is the precise time they were moving into their new home and (2) that this was absolutely no balloonor dirigible of any kind that they saw going overhead.

"The Lake Shore Book," a volume containing the investigated backgrounds of all the businessman in Lake County, had this to say (in part) about the Shoenman's:

"Technical experience, truly international in character, lies behind "the physical psychology" in television field which has achieved in Lake County. After making an outstanding record in the bridge, iron and oil industries in North America, South America, Africa and Asia, in which he has specialized, his company, new known as the best in the country, he was born in Springfield, Illinois on April 22, 1916."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document. The text on the page describes an encounter with a large, circular object with a red light on the front, which was observed by a witness who was driving his car. The object reportedly hovered and emitted beams of light, and the witness reported feeling frightened and running away. The text also mentions the object moving over a wooded area and then quickly leaving, leaving the witnesses shaken.

The image appears to contain a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The document contains multiple sightings reports, including the following:

Sighting: 29 August 1955.
Object: Triangular shape, 30 feet across. Dome on top, flashed green light. Moved in an erratic manner, stopped abruptly.

Sighting: Late July or early August 1955.
Object: Size described as larger than house, and as flat, circular in shape. Rod-like lights in front, hovered about fifty feet in the air for about 5-10 minutes. Two spotlights threw their beams on the ground.

Sighting: 22 October 1955.
Object: Circular, bright orange glow, 500 feet off the ground. Bright, orange light was observed trailing from the bottom of the object towards the earth.

Results of Interviews:
(1) Witness indicated: Proceeded to the home of arriving there at approximately 1:45 hours or 27 June,...

- page 13 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Results of Interviews:
(1) Have seen the landing of the "saucer"; talked to the person who escaped from within it, and who gave him a message to deliver to the effect that this event to his priest. The message was advised to tell his congregation this event was a manifestation, and to his poster mother. However, the peculiar nature of this case is, that he did not give the information to the member and self-styled official UFO investigator of the USOF. Rumors began to spread with the idea suggested that the authorities apprehended this person, and that he had been given a "routine" security type interrogation. A good musically, it is said to be a bit on the "odd" side, living in his own little world, and driven to a large fixation. It was further learned that on the same day that he claimed to have seen the flying saucer, there were no reports of part of crew or passengers being offered rewards for information concerning their apprehension.

(2) Stating: On the evening of the same day (27 June) proceeded to Willoughby, Ohio, to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. XXXXXX. On the visit, the people in the residence gave no indication whatever as to having any knowledge that the undersigned investigator had in his possession a complaint involving USOF. In brief, they both repeated to this investigator almost word for word their previous report to the USOF. The investigator learned in the course of the interview that the USOF had built up a file on this case, and that it was in their records. Also, the drawings of the craft sighted are apparently reviewed by the USOF. It was learned during this interview that the USOF is leading people to be aware that some type of confidential information may be in their possession.

(3) Fighting: In the latter part of the day (28 June), an attempt was made to contact the individual who appears to be officially connected with the USOF organization in question. Inasmuch as we were personally advised that the USOF director of investigation is the dossier, it was important that some background information on this individual be obtained. However, it was determined that he did not lived in the address given to the USOF. Further attempts to contact him through various other addresses were unsuccessful.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, likely describing various UFO sighting cases. 

The text in the document reads as follows:

salesman, was out of town.  Discussions with "tourist's" wife, who is observing the sightings with her husband, and she imparted some basic information on the sightings, although "tourist" was not at home when investigator called. Further, she gave this investigator the impression that her husband, "tourist," had impressed on her the importance of not being too interested in UFO's, although she hinted that he is himself quite interested.

7.- In accordance with a procedure and plans described, the final interview was had with Mr. --------- , the organizer and conductor of these sightings, and somehow one gets the impression that he was conducting a sort of "proving ground" for the individuals who had made sightings on this date (1952), and it is hard to believe that all of these sightings were not "coached" to some degree.  However, Mr. --------- was very cooperative and sincere in his efforts, and it is believed his results were conscientious and accurate.  He advised he has a list of all sightings located in the Cleveland Municipal Airport there are any numerous types of craft flying out of the Cleveland area, that advertising balloons, helicopters, transports jet types to name only a few.

8.- In conclusion, the investigator expressed themselves to all interested that although sightings and incidents of UFOs have been observed, and these are the only "official" UFO agencies, it was strongly recommended that all subjects made as the USAF the proper investigating and disposing agency, and that IF the Air Force finds the incidents were not of the nature as described, no further investigations would be taken.

9. - 
Case:  Mr. ---------- an impressionable young man with an over active imagination did observe some natural or explainable phenomena, but his investigations built up a "strange and mysterious landing" and he recounted this fantastic story himself.  Considered an "eccentric" or "psychological manifes-tation" UFO report.

10. - 
Case: This was the only case of the four that did not disclose any discrepancies between the original and present UFO reports.  No firm or definite conclusions can be drawn due to lack of further information and the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining further information to assist in arriving at a more definite report.  Considered an "unknown."

11. - 
Case:  From his obvious susceptibility to suggestion, and description of his "1500 MPH UFO" with a light appearing shinning to the ground, the object is considered an "aircraft" preparatory to landing, and will be placed in that category.

12. - 
Case:  Apparently an aircraft, but insufficient information.

13.- General: All the individuals associated with the UTOCO appeared to be people who, although good citizens, have visionary tendencies and enthusiastically believe they are helping the UFO program by conducting their own investigations and obtaining data in all unlikely reports from this circumscribed area.

Memorandum for Mr. Ardler
SUBJECT: Brief on UFO Research Council and Courses of Action

1. On 3 February 1956, the UFO Research Council, which through channels (Sherman Adams, Gen. Kelly, etc.) had approved by Gen. Bedell Smith on 30 January 1957, took certain action.

2. A number of cases in dossier form, were submitted to ATIC by this organization. A reply was expected and a determination made as to whether these cases should be studied or explained, and a reply as to the results would be given to this group.

3. This matter was brought to the undersigned's attention recently by a letter from Mr. Edwin G. Nance, 1956, indicating that a response was made (letter attached). A check with Dr. Hynek stated a few weeks ago (prior to receipt of Mr. Nance) that to the best of his knowledge, it was determined that no action of any kind has been taken on this matter.

4. Dr. Hynek stated a few weeks ago (prior to receipt of Mr. Nance) that this organization was one of the most responsible groups and that it was possible that this matter, if determined to be of sufficient consequence, would normally result in special attention or action, as necessary.

5. For your information and background, and to save you the trouble of reviewing the large mass of data of each case, the following is a brief summary of the cases submitted to ATIC by the council in February of this year:

Sighting: 22 October 1955
Location: Cleveland, Ohio area over 105th St.
Object: Circular, bright orange glow, 500 feet off the ground. Bright, and lights in front were observed shining from the bottom or underside.

Sighting: 23 October 1955
Location: 4712 Euclid Road
Time: 7:15 P.M.
Object: Larger, wide as average house. Made a gruff course noise. Somewhat spherical in shape. Row of yellow lights. Tree-top height.

Sighting: Late July or early August (date indefinite) 1955
Location: North of Mulberry Corner, Ohio (Lat. 20°S 30'G)
Object: Size described as larger than house, and "six feet, circular in shape, and light in color. Two beings, approximately three feet in height, were observed through one of the openings in the craft." The craft appeared to be hovering about ten feet from the ground when it drifted away.

- page 17 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Sighting: 29 August 1955
Object: "Cylindrical flying object" in diurnes. Thirty feet across.
Dome on top. A ball of green light struck the ground in front of the object and went out. The object made no sound. The door slid open, and a man came out. He informed the witnesses he had come from another planet.

In view of the possibility that these people may, again, be contacted, the report suggests the President be informed so as to give them some suitable reply (which we can later back up by official paper work), if it is the opinion of the proper authorities that individual cases, some section should be instituted, if for no other reason than for our records to indicate something was done in the matter.

Two courses of action are contemplated:
a. A reply to the UFO Council that no firm conclusion can be reached because of the insufficient data of information given.
b. Request a brief, informal investigation in accordance with AFR 200-2. A reply to the UFO Council would then be that "investigative action has been initiated; results unknown as of this date."

The letter recommendation above is considered the best approach. Any reply to this effect "insufficient information" "no firm conclusion" is still under study may only produce a large mass of additional data from this organization which undoubtedly will further confuse the course of hand.

Your comments and/or recommendations with respect to this matter would be appreciated.
