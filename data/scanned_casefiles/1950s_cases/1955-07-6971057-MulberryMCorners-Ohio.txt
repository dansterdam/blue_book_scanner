Case File Number Two

Case File Number One and this one were grouped in an effort to substantiate Case File Number Three, which is forthcoming in this research paper. Due to the nature of File Three, we realized that before we could present it to the air force for evaluation we would have to have some evidence to back it up. When we started our investigations, we were most skeptical, but as you have and will see, there is much correlation and corroboration of evidence here. This considered our search a success in that we did turn up evidence which supports Case File Number Three. It is our opinion, however, that each file is important and conclusive in itself.

This file involves the experience of Mr. and Mrs. of Willoughby, Ohio. Mr. operates the "Kirt Radio-Television Store" on the intersection of routes 6 and 50k R.D. 2. We interview these two people extensively and separately and their story stood up. Here is Mr.'s account:

"Written Dec. 28, 1955. To Whom It May Concern: one night in late July or very early in August, 1955 I closed my television shop and proceeded to go home just as I always do. I drove in the driveway of my home and stopped the car just off the main highway to walk across the road to get the mail. This evening it was very cloudy and had gotten dark early. As I reached up to open the mail box I saw this red light about 1,000 or 800 feet away coming at me at a right angle. I could see the outline of the thing and one big red light could be seen. The light, when I first saw it, looked about the size of a basketball. It was so big it looked like a transport plane but I could hear no motors.

The second or two I stood there, it flashed through my mind that this big plane was going to crash. Then all at once the ground was illuminated with two brilliant lights, in a very large pattern. These lights were in a vertical beam or directly toward the ground. Then I got scared. I turned and ran back across the road and past my car. I did not stop to get in it, ran toward the house. Because if this was a big plane it would crash right in our front yard. When I got to the back of the house, my wife was at the back door, yelled, 'Shall I turn on the outside lights?' By the time the thing was right over me. As I looked up at it, I realized this was no airplane or anything I had ever seen before. I yelled back, 'Hell no don't turn on any lights-maybe it will miss'. I was then at the back of the house and my wife and children were all there crying. 'What is it?' 'Daddy, what is it?' This thing was now over the garage about 50 to 100 feet off of the ground-hovering there-not moving. I


- page 2 -

More than once Mr. took UFORG investigators out into the field and described the actions of the unidentified flying objects pointing out land marks, etc. He is thoroughly familiar with the physical characteristics of ordinary aircraft and is empathetic that it was none of those. Because, he says "This thing was almost round with a dome on it I've never see anything like it. It was huge".

Investigation revealed from a Col. Huxel in the area that two helicopters, doing research for the proposed Nike sights out there, were out after dark near night after August 22, 195 and that they might have caused the observations. However, the Sheneman's were positive (1) that the event happened in late July or early August time in those times they were moving into their new home and (2) that this was absolutely no helicopter because the thing he saw was huge, etc., and bore no resemblance to a whatsoever.

The Lake Shore Book, a volume containing the investigated background of all the businessmen in Lake County, had this to say (in part) about Mr. Sheneman:

"Technical experiences, truly international in character lies behind the success in the radio television field which has achieved in Lake County. After making an outstanding record in the bridge, iron and oil industries in North America, South America, Asia and Africa he has with a partner, been operating the Kirkland Radio-Television Company, now the best in the county. He was born in Springfield, Illinois on April 22, 1916."

b. Results of Interview:

(1) have seen the landing of the "saucer", talked to one person who emerged from within it, and who gave him a message. In conflict with the effect (as told to this investigator) that, "...tell your leader, if there is another war--we'll take over!" In conflicting this event to his priest, he was advised not to tell his story directly to the proper authorities. This he has not done, not even to his foster mother. However, the peculiar aspect of this case is, that he did give this information to a member and self-styled official UFO investigator of the UFOB.

Further investigation disclosed that although considered an intelligent young man and possesses the attributes of a good musician, he is said to be a bit on the "odd" side, living in his own little world, and given to a large imagination. It was further learned that on the same day he claimed to have seen his "flying saucer," a Cleveland firm was sending up sky rockets as part of an advertising campaign, offering rewards to finders of these rockets. It was determined that these rockets were attempted to obtain one.

(2) Sighting: On the evening of the same day (27 June) proceeded to Willoughby, Ohio, to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. and willingly gave me their account of the sighting they had made in late July or August of 1955. They had no knowledge that the investigator had in his possession a case dossier from the UFOB. In brief, they both repeated to this investigator almost word for word their previous report to the UFOB. However, in the course of discussion, calling up this particular case in their report the investigator learned that the UFOB had built up this particular case in their dossier. The pictures submitted and also shown in the UFOB dossier were not of the area of Mr. home but of an area some distance away.

Also, some of the drawings of the UFO sighted were erroneous according to, who, apparently, reviewed them for the first time. These were revised in the UFOB dossier. It was learned during this interview that Mr. of the UFOB is leading people to believe that he and the UFOB organization are official USAF investigators. They present some type of card for identification, believe to be a USAF Reserve card of some sort.

In view of the fact that Mr. and Mrs. repeated almost the exact story submitted in the UFO case dossier; that Mr. appears familiar with known types of aircraft; and that he still seems frightened almost a year after his sighting, the investigator was left with the impression that Mr. is sincere and truthful and that he did see something unusual and unusual.

(3) Sighting: In the latter part of the day (28 June), an attempt was made to contact who appears to be a sort of "chairman" and self-designated chief UFO investigator of this organization in question. Inasmuch as Mr. for the most part personally prepared the UFO cases and illustration in the dossier, it was brought that some background information on this individual be obtained. It was determined that he did not, and had not lived in the address given to ATIC. However, an insurance address was obtained from his previous landlord.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

salesman, was out of town. Discussions with Rouse's wife, who als
observed the sighting with her husband, produced some interesting
information on this case. Mrs. Rouse was of the opinion that,
although not positive, the object she observed was an aircraft.
Further, she gave this investigator the impression that her husband
got interested in UFO's merely as a hobby, but that his interest
"now has grown out of hand."

7. In accordance with a pre-arranged plan for conducting this series of interviews, the final interview was had with Mr. [redacted] the organizer and
director of the UFORG. He, Mr. [redacted] conducted the investigations on
these sightings, and somehow ran into a few more people who had similar sightings on
this same date (22 October 1955). From all the witnesses accounts this investigator
is led to believe that all those sightings were of some type of aircraft. Strong
support is lent this statement because of numerous and concrete aircraft sightings
and around Cleveland, from both private and municipal airfields. With USAF units
located in the Cleveland Municipal Airport there are numerous types of craft
flying out of the Cleveland area, i.e., advertising blimp, helicopters, transports
jet types to name only a few.

8. At the conclusion of interviews, this investigator emphasized to all interviewed that although submission of some UFO cases and reports from private citizens
and organizations is appreciated by the Air Force, ATIC and other delegated AF units
are the only "official" UFO agencies. It was strongly recommended that all sighting
should be made to ATIC or the nearest AF base immediately, and that if the sighting
were found to possess merit, action to initiate an official USAF investigation
through the 4602d AISS and other pertinent units, who have trained investigators to
handle these cases, would be taken.

C. CONCLUSIONS:

9. [redacted] Case: Mr. [redacted] an impressionable young man with an over
active imagination did observe some natural or explainable phenomena, but his
imagination run riot to build up a story of a "flying saucer" landing and its occupation talking to him to such an extent that he now believes or alleges to believe
this fantastic story himself. Considered an "eccentric" or "psychological manifestation" UFO report.

10. [redacted] Case: This was the only case of the four that did not disclose any
discrepancies by "mere" the original and present UFO report. No firm or definite conclusion can be made due to lack of further information and the difficulty of obtain
additional facts from the sources due to the length of time elapsing from the first
report. Considered an "unknown."

11. [redacted] Case: From his obvious susceptibility to suggestion, and description
of his sighting "500 feet from the ground - a light beam appearing shining towards
the ground," the object is considered an aircraft preparatory to landing, and will
be placed in that category.

12. [redacted] Case: Apparently an aircraft, but insufficient information.

13. General: All the individuals associated with the UFORG appeared to be
people who, although good American citizens, have vivid imaginations and sincerely
believe they are helping the UFO program by conducting their own investigation and
analyses. It is further concluded that in all future reports from this organization

will probably border on the fantasy side rather than on the logical or factual so
necessary in resolving reported sightings.

D. RECOMMENDATIONS:

14. The UFO cases investigated herein be entered individually in the UFO case
files under the following categories:

a. Ankenbrandt (Eccentric) i.e. Other

b. Sheneman                 Unknown

c. Smith                   Aircraft

d. Roush                   Insufficient Information.

Memorandum for Mr. Arcier

SUBJECT: Brief on UFO Research Council and Courses of Action

1. On 3 February 1956, Mr. [redacted] UFO Research Council, located in Cleveland, was granted a conference in ATIC, with Capt. Hardin, [redacted]. This conference was the result of a letter (attached) dated 30 December, through channels (Sherman Adams, Gen. Kelly of the Joint Legislative Liaison Office, etc.) was approved by Col Eriksen on 30 January (letter attached).

2. A number of cases in dossier form were submitted to ATIC by this organization, and it appears, a promise was exacted from Capt Hardin that the cases would be studied or explained, and a reply as to the results would be given to this group.

3. This matter was brought to the undersigned's attention recently by a letter from Mr. [redacted] dated 6 June 1956, reiterating this promise. A check with Dr. [redacted] indicates that a promise was made.

4. To the best of the undersigned's knowledge, it was determined that no action of any kind has been taken on this matter.

5. Dr. Hynek stated a few weeks ago (prior to receipt of Mr. [redacted] letter) that this organization was one of the most active; that he had personally met its members and being a dedicated group, would normally press matters to extreme, if necessary.

6. For your information and background, and to save you the trouble of reviewing the large mass of data of each case, the following is a brief summary of the four cases submitted to ATIC by the council in February of this year.

a. case,
Sighting: 22 October 1955
Cleveland, Ohio area over 105th St.
Object: Circular, bright orange glow, 500 feet off the ground. A bright, orange light was observed shining from the bottom of the object towards the earth.

b. case,
Sighting: 22 October 1955
1711 Avondale Road
South Euclid, Ohio
7:15 p.m.
Object: Large, wide as average house. Made gruff course noise. Somewhat spherical in shape. Row of yellow lights.
Tree-top height.

c. case,
Sighting: Late July or early August (date indefinite) 1955
North of Mulberry Corners, Ohio (Int. Route 6 & 560)
8:45 p.m.
Object: Size described as larger than house, and as flat, circular in shape. Red light in front, green in rear. Hovered about fifty feet in the air for about five minutes. Two spotlights then cast beams on the ground. Noise like a fan, lights then drifted away.


- page 17 -

Sighting: 29 August 1955
Two miles west of intersection of Route 6 and 306.
Between 1:30 to 2:00 a.m.

Object: Typically "flying saucer" in shape. Thirty feet across. Down on top... half of green light struck the ground in front of... as he started to run. Object landed, door slid open, and a man came out. He informed... in English, "they" were from another planet.

7. In view of the possibility that these people may, again, contact the President's office with a request for a follow-up or explanation, unless we can give them some suitable reply (which we can later back up by official paper work), it is the opinion of the undersigned that, regardless of the merits of each individual case, some action should be initiated, if for no other reason than for our records to indicate something was done in this matter.

8. Two courses of action are contemplated:

a. A reply to the UFO Council that no firm conclusion can be reached because of the insufficiency of information submitted.

b. Request a brief, informal investigation by the 4602nd AISS, in accordance with AFR 200-2. A reply to the UFO Council would then be that "investigative action has been initiated, results unknown as of this date."

9. The letter recommendation above is considered the best approach. Any reply to the effect "insufficient information" "no firm conclusion" is still under study" may only produce a large mass of additional data from this organization which undoubtedly will further confuse the cases on hand.

10. Your comments and/or recommendations with respect to this matter would be appreciated.
