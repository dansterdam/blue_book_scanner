OBJECT IN THE SKY

On the night of July 27, 1957 I saw a large phenomena in the sky. I place the sighting of this object on the "New York and the New England side and about a third of a mile over the Sound, directly across from Larchmont, New York. The unknown or unknown was about a mile above the surface of the earth. The object was round and yet the addngs were not true. They were oval and went in and out. The unknown appeared as a gray, white light and as I became aware of what I was seeing I realized that I had better stay alert and record the happenings for I was gradually this thing was something extraordinary. I could see through red, blue, green and white. And as I stated above, the make-up and predominant color was white. The colors which I was able to see were in from the edges. The edges were definitely white. The colors were blinking on and off and there was cool blinking. The size, the color, no unusual intervals between the blinkings. There was order, timing and precision, and it was considerable. The colors and of continuously. "The colors which I saw were worn in this all conclusive white. This object moved very slowly toward the shore line and at the same intervals about a mile, as I have said before.

Upon reaching the shore line the colors and the all conclusive white weakened from the edges and worked inward toward the middle till there was nothing. Or to put it another way, the phenomena just shrunk and became nothing. It vanished.

Five minutes went by and the same or like phenomena appeared in relatively the same position and at the same altitude. Along with it appeared another object with the exact and similar characteristics as the first. I could now see two most bodies of light. The movement, the lights, the colors, were, in this moment, doing nothing but like the first described above, the second object, which I speak of was farther out over the Sound and was about 1/5 yards to the left of its mate. Both were at the same altitude. Both were moving in on the shore line. The new mate, the one to the left, was moving just a little faster for it was moving in on the other phenomena.

Then the new object appeared to be about 50 yards from its mate a change commenced. The colored lights were going on and off. And suddenly the colored lights condensed and became four great jagged pieces of light illuminated and with the remaining light took silly. Or, to put it another way, the four jagged pieces of light were about ten times brighter and more than the remaining light. I saw the four pieces of jagged light for about fifteen seconds. Then the colored lights went on and commenced to go on and off. And then from the edges, working inward, the object turned to a rusty red. At this point the phenomena to the left went into or behind its mate and they became one. While all of this was going on the object closest to the shore remained white and I could see the entire blinking or flashing object, which I continued to move in on the shore line and the lights continued to go on and off. At this moment two airplanes passed over very near head and tail lights on. While all this was going on at approximate altitude. I said to myself, "This is going to be interesting." And over once more focused on the remaining light which was now a third of a mile over the land. At this moment the light shrunk and became nothing.

The experience which I have just described above took place at the Stamford Yacht Club and occurred from 9:40 p.m. until 10:30 p.m.
