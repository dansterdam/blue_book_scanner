AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

A-2, 301st Bomb Wing, SAC                                   1 Dec 52                PAGE    2    OF    3

The following report is submitted in accordance with instructions contained in
Letter, Headquarters USAF, Subject: Reporting of Information on Unidentified
Flying Objects, dated, 10 December 1951, File No. AFOIN-52-A.

1. A single circular object, brilliant white in color and ten times the
size of the brightest stars, was reportedly sighted by a ground observer at
32 20N - 93 48', 2228 hours, 16 April 1952. The exposed surface of the object
appeared to be flat. The object, traveling in an unbelievable speed in an un-
wavering heading of about 100 degrees, emitted no trail, exhaust, or sound.
After passing over the city of Shreveport, it remained constant in 100 degrees
time and continued its unwavering course on the reciprocal heading until lost
to sight. The observer reported the object as a round, bright white object
in approximately six seconds. During the execution of its turn, the object
appeared to become picked in color, gradually turning to red then the recovered
to white, after turning, appeared as a "ball of light" from the ground. From
circular shape to a thinner lens shape, and, approximately ten seconds after
completion, its turn, the object appeared to emit a faint, pulsating, reddish
reddish trail, as if a few circular segments had become detached from the main
body. While in sight, the object could be described, and there
was no apparent change in altitude or speed during the period of observation.

2. The object was first observed directly overhead by the observer at 2228
hours, 16 April 1952. Duration of the observation did not exceed seventy seconds.
After which time the object had passed over the entire city of Shreveport and
returned and was lost to sight, having covered an observed distance of at least
twenty-five miles.

3. The observer had no visual aids other than relative bearings from the
stars.

4. The observer reporting the sighting was standing on his lawn at
Shreveport, Louisiana, at the time of observation.

5. Observer reporting the sighting, Captain [REDACTED], a North Squadron, [REDACTED] Wing, [REDACTED] is a SAC Aircraft Commander,
a Combat Pilot with more than 3000 hours and six years experience in heavy and
medium bombardment and transport type aircraft. Captain [REDACTED] has had prior
experience as a Special Agent for the Counter-Intelligence Corps, and the
past several months, has been assigned to duty as Standardization Officer. His background training and experience qualify him as a competent observer.
Insofar as his observation from available sources can be determined, the above reported sighting may be considered completely reliable. At the time of the incident, Captain [REDACTED] by a neighbor, Mr. [REDACTED], was a paratrooper sergeant
during World War II, and is presently employed as [REDACTED] in Shreveport.

6. Weather and wind conditions (teletype responses) at time of sighting:
