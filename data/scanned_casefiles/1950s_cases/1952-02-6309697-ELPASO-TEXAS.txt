IN REPLY REFER TO:
AFOIN-ATIA-26

SUBJECT: Photos of Unidentified Aerial Objects

TO: Commanding Officer
1st Strategic Support Squadron
Attn: Wing Intelligence Officer
Biggs Air Force Base, Texas

1. Reference is made to your AF Form 112 dated 27 February 1952, subjects "Unidentified Flying Objects", and the photographs enclosed thereto.

2. The unidentified objects which appeared in the photographs were caused by small flaws in the emulsion of the negative.

3. It is requested that information be obtained as to where the negatives were developed and whether or not the source, Capt Ausick, knew the flaws caused the image on the print.

4. The Directorate of Intelligence, Hq USAF, has requested this investigation. Since the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena is a serious problem and if these photos were submitted as a hoax or joke, disciplinary action should be taken. However, if the source was not aware of the damage to the negative and conscientiously submitted these for analysis, no further action will be taken.

(REFERENCE CSAF ITEM 6, TT 83, LAST PART)

MRS. BARBER, AID, INFORMED ME THIS MORNING
THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TO YOU REGARDING AF

THEREFORE, IF YOUR EVALUATION OF THE ORIGIN
OF THESE IMAGES IS WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY
OF A DOUBT, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU CONTACT
THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER OF THE FIRST STRATEGIC

WHETHER CAPTAIN MUSICK DEVELOPED THE FILM
HIMSELF OR HAD IT DEVELOPED BY A CIVILIAN

OR IF IT WAS DEVELOPED BY A MILITARY LAB,
IT APPEARS THAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WILL
BE INVOLVED FOLLOWING A REPORT OF OUR FIND-

SUBJECT:  Evaluation of 35 mm negative                                   5 Nov. 1952

1.  Examination of the place of 35 mm negative was made under notification and by direct transmission and reflected light.  The following opinion is given:

    a.  The negative contains two (2) flaws in the emulsion of the film of such a nature that the emulsion coating is uneven.  On the surface and there are edges that will cause slight shadows and highlights when viewed under reflected light.

    b.  The cause of the flaws is unknown however they do appear to be caused by sticking of the 35 mm film.  In the processing.  A similar appearing defect appears on the edge of the film near the exposed roof top.

APPENDIX V
El Paso, Texas UNCLASSIFIED 21 February 1952

I. DESCRIPTION:
This report contained a photograph of two very unusual objects. The source, an A/2c, stated that he was attempting to photograph "a circle" that he observed in a clear rainbow. The "circle" disappeared but he took a picture anyway. Upon developing, he having developed, two circular objects, at first in appearance to the planet Saturn, were noticed.

II. SCIENTIFIC EXAMINATION:
Continuation of the negative under a microscope showed that the images on the print were unusual. The damaged spots on the negative, the cause of those damaged spots is unknown but it appears that the emulsion had been heated or burned as it was brownish in color. The spots could also have been due to something touching the emulsion while it was still in a gelatin state.

III. CONCLUSIONS:
The images on the print are due to damaged spots on the negative.

22 April 1952

STATEMENT

I developed the negatives in a steel Nikon tank using Microdal fine grain developer. All developing was done in my own home in a make shift darkroom (namely the bathroom). The exact date that the film was developed is unknown.

I take and develop pictures as a hobby. This was the second roll of film developed since 1947, the year I took up the hobby of photography. The film was developed in accordance with the instructions for fine grain developing. The time was twelve (12) minutes for developing with a thirty (30) second stop bath of 3 percent acetic acid and fixed for fifteen (15) minutes in Asco Acid Fixer. Washing was done in the tank for approximately twenty (20) minutes. After discovering the supposed images, I brought the negatives to Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, where the negative was projected on a screen by 97th Bombardment Wing Intelligence personnel for their inspection. No one had seen anything like the supposed image before and the negative was taken to the Base Photo Laboratory where it was enlarged. Prints were processed and they were in turn taken to the Command, Office 1st Strategic Support Squadron, who referred them to the Squadron Intelligence Officer for action.

In the April or May issue of "U.S. Camera" I read an article in the "Letters to the Editor" column about someone who had a similar flaw in the negative and the explanation was quite concise. They stated the flaws were caused by bending the film.
