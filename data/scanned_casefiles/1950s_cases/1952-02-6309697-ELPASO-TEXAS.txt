SUBJECT:
INQUIRY REGARDING AERIAL VISUAL OBJECTS REPORTEDLY OBSERVED AT EL PASO. TEXAS. ON 6 FEBRUARY 1952

On 6 February 1952, this office was notified that two unidentified visual objects had been reported observed in the sky over El Paso, Texas, on that date.

The information received indicated that the objects were first observed at approximately 1630 hours and were in sight for approximately 5 minutes. The objects were described as being round in shape, silver in color, and traveling at a high rate of speed at an estimated altitude of approximately 20.000 feet.

This office contacted the Control Tower at El Paso International Airport and was advised that no unidentified objects had been observed from the Control Tower on the date and at the time mentioned. In addition, no other reports from this area regarding visual sightings of unidentified aerial objects had been received by this office.

As no further information was available, and as there was no confirmation of the initial report from other reliable sources, no further investigation was conducted by this office.

The image contains a photograph of unidentified aerial objects. The text indicates that these objects were captured in the photograph and the negatives show small flaws, suggesting the objects were real. The document also mentions that the investigation of these unidentified aerial phenomena has been requested by the Directorate of Intelligence of the USAF, and that the Air Force's efforts to investigate these objects are appreciated.

3. It is suggested that information be obtained as to where the negatives are deposited and if possible to examine the sources. Capt. Duvick, 
4. The Directorate of Intelligence, HQ USAF, has requested this investigation. Since the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena must be limited, it is desired that your photographic coverage and any information developed be submitted as a basis for evaluation.
5. Your efforts in this matter are appreciated by the Air Force and no further action is contemplated at this time.

The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, describing the evaluation of 35 mm negatives.

SUBJECT: Evaluation of 35 mm negatives
DETERMINATION OF THE SIZE OF 35 MM NEGATIVES: The determination of the size of 35 mm negatives was made under magnification, and the following specifications were established:

The film of each picture that the negatives contain is of standard 35 mm motion picture film, being 0.975 inches in width. When viewed under reflected light, the frames measure 0.945 inches on the long side and 0.630 inches on the short side.

THE CENTER OF THE FILM IS IN PERFECT FOCUS, so much so that should be caused by sticking of the film during the processing and enlargement, but the fault seems to be inherent in the original negatives.

I. CASE:

This report contained a photograph of two very unusual objects. The objects, which were quite large, appeared like rainbows. The "circles" disappeared but he took a photograph anyway. upon viewing the objects, certain spots on the planet, Saturn, were noticed.

II. STARS FILMED:

Examination under a microscope showed that the image on the negative was definitely not due to the normal, celestial spots on the negative. The nature of these imprints had been studied, but it was still considered unexplained.

III. CYCLES:

The imprints on the print were two to two and one-half inches in diameter. It was still not clear what had caused these imprints.

2. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 A.M., 25 FEBRUARY 1952, WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PHOTOGRAPH A CIRCLE OBSERVED THROUGH BINOCULARS AND LATER IDENTIFIED AS A WEATHER BALLOON, TWO BRIGHT OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED THROUGH THE CAMERA VIEWFINDER.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a statement from the 1st Strategic Support Squadron regarding the development of film negatives.

STATEMENT
I developed the negatives in a steel mirror tank using Melamol fine grain developer. All developing was done in complete darkness (safelight). The exact date that the film was developed is unknown.
I take and develop pictures as a hobby. This was the second roll of film developed since 1947, the year I took up the hobby of photography. The film was developed in accordance with the instructions given for fine grain developing. The time was two (12) minutes in the developer, one minute in the rinse, and two baths of fifteen (15) percent acetic acid and fixed for fifteen (15) minutes in an Hypo Fixer. Fixing was done in the tank for approximately twenty (20) minutes. After discovering the supposed images, I brought the negatives to Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, where the negative was projected on a screen by 97th Bombardment Wing Intelligence personnel for their inspection. No one had seen anything like the supposed image before and the negative was taken to the Commanding Officer and then to the Technical Intelligence Office of the Commanding General, Fifth Air Force, Control and Warning Support Squadron who referred them to the Squadron Intelligence Officer for action.
In the April or May issue of U.S. Camera, I read an article in the "Letters to the Editor" column about someone who had a similar flaw in the negative and the explanation was quite concise. They stated the films were caused by bending the film.
