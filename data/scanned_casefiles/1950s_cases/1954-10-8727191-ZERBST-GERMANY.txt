Subject: Activity in HERSCHFELD

Date: 8 October 1954

Edward J. Ruppelt 1st Lt. USAF

1. On 1 October 1954, Captain Richard, Pan American Airlines pilot, reported to a PRA outbound flight #105 from Berlin to New York, that while flying over Herschfeld at approximately 23,000 feet, he observed a bright object in the sky.

The object appeared to be a round disc-like object and was hovering in the air. The object was quite bright and seemed to be oscillating or vibrating. After about 30 seconds the object made a very fast climb and disappeared.

Although the pilot's rate of climb and airspeed was over 400 miles per hour, the object ascended much faster. The pilot did not consider the possibility of the object being a meteor or other astronomical phenomenon, since it appeared intelligently controlled and made a very purposeful departure.

No other aircraft were observed flying in the area, and no sound was heard. The pilot was quite certain that the object was not an aircraft of any known type.
