None.

E. Object Sighted:
A light emanating in the shape of a circle, of an intensity much greater than that of a bright moon, giving the impression of form in connection with the light. The light was white in appearance and did not show any signs of refraction into a band or continuous spectrum.

STATEMENT

Following is a report of the sighting of an unidentified object in the Oak Ridge Area by the undersigned. On the morning of 18 December 1950, the following personnel were riding to their work at NRPA Division, Martelle Engine and Airplane Corp. in the 5-50 Area at Oak Ridge, Tennessee:

Lt. Col. [REDACTED], USAF
Capt. [REDACTED], USAF
Major [REDACTED], USAF
Major [REDACTED], USAF
Mr. [REDACTED]
Mr. [REDACTED]

Mr. [REDACTED], Commander, and Major [REDACTED] were riding in the front seat; Col. [REDACTED] Major, and Mr. [REDACTED] were in the rear.

At approximately 0827, while riding southwest on the turnpike just outside the restricted area, Col. [REDACTED] sighted a very bright reflection through the windshield of the car. Major [REDACTED], who was sitting beside Col. [REDACTED] and whose attention was attracted by Col. [REDACTED], looking at the sky, sighted the same reflection. Col. [REDACTED] then called the attention of the remaining occupants of the car to the reflection. Of these, Commander [REDACTED] also sighted the reflection, but Mr. [REDACTED] did not sight it.

The reflection was visible through the front windshield of the car only for a moment because, shortly thereafter, the road turned to the right. The corresponding turn of the car so placed the relative position of the reflection that it could not be seen through the left front window, which was frosted and permitted excellent vision.

The object appeared only as the bright reflection of the sun from an apparently metal surface, much as might be expected from an aircraft at a great distance. No accurate estimate of the object's size or range could be made from the observation. It appeared to be southwest of Oak Ridge Townsite at an angle of elevation of about 25Â° from the level.

Post Office Box X
Oak Ridge, Tennessee

1. On December 18, 1950, at sometime between 0820 and 0830, the following NEPA employees were riding in a vehicle on the turnpike within the Controlled Area toward the NEPA Project approximately one mile short of the "Y" cutoff to White Wing entrance and Y-121

[Names redacted]

2. The passengers, with the exception of Dr. [redacted] who did not attempt to participate in the viewing, observed a light emanating in the shape of a circle, of an intensity much greater than that of a bright moon, through the windshield of the vehicle. The viewers had the impression that there was a form in connection with the light rather than merely a point source. The light was wide in appearance and did not show any signs of rotation into a band or continuous spectrum. It appeared to be from 15 to 30 degrees elevated above the horizontal and on an azimuth between west and northwest, and appeared to be traveling 15 miles an hour. The impression of its traveling seemed to diminish considerably in size during the approximate thirty seconds during which it was viewed. The vehicle remained in motion, and in following the course of the road, changed its relative position so that the object was viewed during the last few seconds from the side windows. As the vehicle proceeded down the road a near-by ridge obstructed the view of the object, and although the vehicle completed the turn toward D-25 at the "Y" intersection

and the passengers had a relatively clear view at points along the road. The object was not viewed again. The observers were unable to estimate approximate size, speed, or vertical elevation; and, therefore, were not certain whether the object was over the Controlled Area or a considerable distance away. There was no v-port or trail or any other visible condition within the vicinity of the object and there were no clouds which could have obscured it.

The observers were unable to identify the object in terms of mass or shape, other than the circular appearance of the lights. However, the circular area appeared to darken, starting at approximately 7:00 to 9:00 o'clock along the perimeter and continuing to darken along the perimeter and inner area until the light was concentrated in approximately 1400 to 3:00 o'clock position of a very small diameter, at which point it appeared somewhat similar to a large star.

3. The observers were not in complete agreement as to whether the object was moving at a speed which caused it to diminish in size or actually was diminishing in size without any great velocity of travel due to the darkening effect described above.

1. SYNOPSIS: An unidentified flying object was observed over the town of Oak Ridge, Tennessee from 1245 to 1300 hours, 5 December 1950 by two (2) persons.

2. DETAILS: Between 1245 and 1250 hours, 5 December 1950, Mrs. Secretary at the Security Division, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, while standing on Tennessee Avenue at the west end of the bus platform across from the Post Office, observed an object over the top of the Post Office building, flying in an easterly direction at a slow speed, at a distance of approximately two (2) miles and at an altitude of about 500 feet. Mrs. [redacted] stated the object was north or northeast position, in the words of Mrs. [redacted] the object was "brilliant metallic, as aluminum or highly burnished metal that reflected the light, shape round, flat or disk-like, and appeared to turn slightly to the left or northwest and when turning the appearance changed and the light was no longer reflected by the object and its speed seemed to slow down, but no change in speed". The object left no definite trail; however, on the edge of the left side of the object a misty "halo" could be seen. The object flew a straight course and no noise could be heard. The total time of observation was about sixty (60) seconds.

At about 1200 hours, Mrs. [redacted], Oak Ridge, while in her yard, observed an object described similarly with the one observed by Mrs. [redacted] with the exception that the object was moving west when she observed it.

On 7 December 1950 Mr. [redacted] Meteorological Division, Oak Ridge, Tennessee stated that the following weather conditions prevailed at 1300 hours on 5 December 1950: wind was from the west at 5 mph, the sky was clear, visibility twelve (12) miles, temperature was 46 degrees.

1. Reference is made to the attached letter.

2. The brief period of radar (weak signal) target detection, immediately following reports of visual sighting of an aircraft over the Northeast end of the restricted area, is not sufficient to provide an evaluation. It is noted that radar targets were not detected until after visual reporting. This could indicate that the radar operators were not doing a good job prior to receipt of visual report, or that they were doing too good a job (reporting minor radar points due to random noise, etc.) after receipt of visual reports. The report tends one to believe that the target signal strength and the short time of detection of the radar target were wholly inadequate to establish a "radar track".

Area.

2. DETAILS:

    a. Visual Sighting - Reference is made to inclosure #1, statement
of Lt. Col. S. USAF, Commander USAF and Major USAF, and
USAF, all of the NEPA Division, and inclosure #2, letter from

and T. T. ELY, all of the NEPA Division.

    b. Radar Sighting - At 0839, 18 December 1950, a "small point"
appeared on the radar scopes of the 663rd ADW Squadron, Knoxville Airport,
Knoxville, Tennessee, near the southeast corner of the Oak Ridge Controlled
Area on a range bearing of 190 degrees, at a speed of sixty (60) miles
per hour. Height could not be determined but was estimated at 2500 feet.
The object remained on the scopes until 0045 at which time it disappeared.
Fighter Interception was attempted with negative results.

    c. Weather Conditions - At 0720 the wind was from the Northeast
at seven (7) miles per hour and the temperature was twenty (20) degrees
