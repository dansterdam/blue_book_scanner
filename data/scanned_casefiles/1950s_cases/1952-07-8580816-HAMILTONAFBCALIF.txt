1. "Beginning July 17, 1952, KLM starts DC-6B flights from the Netherlands to Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. The DC-6B's will fly twice a week from Amsterdam to Buenos Aires, one flight being routed via Frankfurt, Geneva, Lisbon, Dakar, Recife, Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo and the other via Zurich, Lisbon, etc. The DC-6B's on these routes will accommodate 50 passengers, the 'Honeymoon Suite' has four seats, while the main cabin has 34 seats, and the rear cabin is equipped with 12 sleeper seats."

2. "The schedule of the special air freight service, which KLM recently inaugurated between Amsterdam and Johannesburg, has been revised, with the result that the time taken for each flight is now one day less. Since July 9, the 'flying freight-truck' have been leaving Amsterdam on Tuesday and arriving in Johannesburg on Thursday every two weeks."

3. [A name is redacted] "who has been General Chief of Flying for KLM for the past four years, and in the employ of KLM as a pilot since 1945, resigned his position effectively August 1, 1952. Just as he was on the verge of departure with his family, he was offered and accepted a new position with KLM. He will now be a general representative for KLM and will be stationed in Hollywood to act as an Operations adviser. He will also take over all jet research."

4. "On July 24 at about 6:30 a big formation of 'Flying Saucers' was seen above Arnhem. Mrs. [name redacted] and her children, two sons of 16 and 13 and two daughters of 12 and 10, saw them coming in 'V' formation from the North and they could see them for several minutes before they suddenly disappeared to the South."
