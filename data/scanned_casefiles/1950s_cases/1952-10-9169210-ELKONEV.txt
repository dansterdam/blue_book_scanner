SUMMARY:

SUMMARY: An unidentifiable flying object was sighted by Major Robert L. Howard and from (A) civilian observers approximately ten (2) miles west of Elko, Nevada at 0200 hours (PST), 17 October 1952. The object, approximately three times the size and magnitude of a ten-panel Yerkes, appeared to be in the form of a disk and to produce a yellowish-white light. During observation, the object moved in a southwest way direction with a bouncing motion while ascending rapidly.

AF FORM 112-PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: USAF NORC #850, Utah    State: Agricultural College, Logan, Utah    REPORT NO.    PAGE TWO OF TWO PAGES

FIXOBRPT

1. This report of an unidentified flying object is made by Major Hobert L. Howard, AO 16,765, Air Force ROTC Detachment #860, Utah State Agricultural College, Logan, Utah, a USAF pilot on flying status who is 34 years of age and who has been commissioned service. Observation of the object was made, in addition to subject officer's log.

2. The object appeared to observers to be a disk (similar to a poker chip) emitting a yellow-white light and to be approximately three times the size and magnitude of the planet Venus. No exhaust system, trail or means of propulsion was observed. Object appeared to blink rapidly (fractional section blinking). Object appeared to move rapidly, however, no estimate of speed could be made due to the lack of points of reference. During the period of observation, the object maintained a bounding motion similar to that of a kite.

3. Object was observed at 0200 hours (PST), 17 October 1952, and was observed for approximately five minutes. Observers did not remain in the area to determine the manner of disappearance.

4. Observation was made from the ground along U.S. Highway 40, approximately two (2) miles west of Elko, Nevada (opposite Elko Municipal Airport). When first observed, the object appeared at approximately 45° above the horizon, north west (35°) of the point of observation. During the period of observation, the object moved rapidly on a south westerly course, ascending at an estimated 500 to 1500 feet per minute. All observations were made with the unaided eye.

5. Observers, in addition to subject officer, were his wife, the owner of a transport company and two experienced and reliable passenger bus operators. (Names and addresses will be furnished upon request). All observers are regarded as extremely reliable.

6. At the time of observation, the weather was clear with no moon. There were no surface winds. (Wind data: unknown).

7. There were no known conditions, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the sighting was obtained. There was no known attempt at interception. Location of air traffic in the area is unknown.

NOTE: The bottom of the document contains a standard disclaimer about the document containing information affecting national defense.
