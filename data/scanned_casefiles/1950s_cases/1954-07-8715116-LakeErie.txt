REPLY:

Upon information contained in the attached report of investigation, the following are the details:

Date - July 29, 1954
Place - Near Green, Ohio
Depot - From a source which has indicated a high degree of reliability

While cruising in a westerly direction at approximately 1812 hours on July 29, 1954, the object appeared to be cylindrical in shape, white and black in color, and seemed to be traveling on the surface or just above the surface of the water. The speed on the surface or near the surface was difficult to estimate.

The object was first sighted approximately 11 miles north of Green, Ohio, and continued on a northwesterly course. The object was first sighted at an estimated altitude of 500 feet and seemed to be descending. After sighting the object, the observer has first bright light, approximately 1000 feet ahead, and then the object itself.

Resting, the object was first sighted at an estimated 1000 feet ahead and 500 feet above the ground. Since our interview occurred several days after the incident, details could not be as precise as immediately after the occurrence.

On October 21, 1954, we were informed that the object was not in proximity of the Lake Erie Ordinance Depot at the time of the sighting.

[Most of the text in the body of the document is illegible due to poor image quality and black redaction marks. The header "FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION" is clearly visible at the top of the page.]

The date "7/26/54" can be partially made out in the synopsis section, but the rest of the text is largely unreadable.

The bottom of the page contains some partially visible text and form fields, but the details are not clear enough to transcribe accurately.

A 62-1204

know what the object could have been and that he had talked it over with several fishermen in Europe, but does not offer any suggestions-

On October 1, 1954, Colonel BRUENE, ATIC, Dayton, Ohio, advised that he was familiar with the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization and had been in contact with them concerning this incident. He was aware of such an object other than before or after this incident. He stated that he had been in contact with Mr. W. B. Heffernan, who had seen the object in the water. He described three white lights in a vertical line in the water. He described these white lights as being about 100 feet long and have a visible root into the water. Control tower personnel at the base also saw the object. He stated that the engine and radio controlled. Long and have a visible root into the water. About 100 feet long, bright time at about 500 feet under the surface. Traveled a few feet per second. Propeller was three feet long, made bright arc like lines in water. Colonel BRUENE advised that the men still refer to this incident and are retrieving these lights have been seen as described by Mr. Heffernan.

Lieutenant's Aide, Field Office in Germany, said on October 1, 1954, that the object could not have been one of their targets. Became aware of this when a map was consulted to have traveled the surface of the water. These lights are made by a bright object. The first would not sink on hitting the water. It could not have been a submarine. Bright object was seen at night. Aerial phenomena could not exist at this point. He stated that the object was seen in the water and was not a submarine.
