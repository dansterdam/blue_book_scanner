10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One very bright object larger than a star. Color was bright white. Object was observed visually and through binoculars. Was in the ESE through sky for about 10 minutes upon which it disappeared rapidly.

11. COMMENTS
Most details of this sighting confirm to critical for probably Mars sighting. Shape, size, color brightness, position, correct with Mars. Short duration of sighting (10 min) & rapid disappear can be accounted for by the very low elevation of Mars at time of sighting. Evaluation: probably astro (Mars).

Here is the text I can read from the document:

[Note: There are several hand-drawn oval/elliptical shapes on the page, but the text in the body of the document is mostly illegible due to poor image quality.]

At the bottom of the page, there appears to be a partially legible note that seems to say "... sighted 4... minutes" but I cannot make out the full text with certainty.


- page 6 -

Note:
Winds from 230 to 270, slight pressure and
displacement. East to South East. Roughly on
wind track and direction. Roughly, possibly
20 minutes in sight.
