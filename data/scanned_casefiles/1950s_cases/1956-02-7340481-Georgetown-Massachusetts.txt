MEMORANDUM FOR UFO FILE

SUBJECT: Late Receipt of UFO Reports

1. This issue of six (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover letter by the 4602d AIS, who received than from the OSI. Reference 4602d AIS File, letter dated 26 December 1956, subject "OSI UFOB Reports."

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest, to over 7 months for the newest (August 1956). It appears that the OSI had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reason before submitting them to the 4602d AIS.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis difficult, if not impossible. A preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.
