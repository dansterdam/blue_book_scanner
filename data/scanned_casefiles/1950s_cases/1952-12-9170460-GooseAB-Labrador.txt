AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

Dir/Int, MEAC                                           REPORT NO.
                                                                IR-65-52 

1. The following information was furnished by the Commanding Officer, Goose 
Air Base, Labrador on the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

2. On 26 November 1952 at 2152Z, an unidentified flying object was sighted 
by an F-9F-8 pilot assigned to the 59^th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron stationed at 
Goose Air Base while in aerial flight in the immediate Goose Air Base area.

3. The object was first observed by both the pilot and radar observer of 
the F-9F-8 over Goose Air Base, then it followed a course of 195^0 for approximately 
40 miles. The altitude of the object varied from 1500 to 12,000 feet; estimated 
speed: 250 to 425 knots, with a general direction of flight between South and 
Southeast. No definite shape or size was noted by observing aircraft. Color 
reported as bright orange-red with light blue-green. No jet or rocket exhausts 
were noted; no sound was heard; and the manner of propulsion was unknown. Object 
displayed excellent maneuvering as it followed friendly aircraft in steep banks 
and turns, always maintaining the same relative distance from aircraft; speeds
were synchronized until object disappeared at 2211Z.

COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:

1. Intercept was attempted by F-94B aircrfat but object maintained same 
relative distance. At this time of the year, "Northern Lights" and other 
phenomena peculiar to the Arctic and Sub-Arctic are prevalent which seems to 
substantiate the reason why the friendly aircraft could not close any distance 
with the object despite violent maneuvering. 

2. Weather conditions encompassing the sighting period was CAVU; wind From 
NW 315^0 at 15 to 20 knots.

3. There was no activity, meteorological or otherwise, which might account 
for the sighting.

4. Other aircraft in the area during the sighting period were C-124, DC-3, 
and Canadian Noftjstar. Pilot of the F-94B stated he observed and identified the 
above aircraft at one time or another.

5. Pilot is an experienced combat pilot with 1800 hours total time, of which 
650 hours is jet time.

The image shows a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, which appears to be a form for reporting UFO sightings. There are two diagrams on this page:

1. The first diagram shows a semicircular chart representing the horizon, with angles marked on it. There is a curved line with the letters "A" and "B" on different points of the line, indicating the first and last point of observation relative to the horizon.

2. The second diagram contains the words "No Motion" and is meant to illustrate the motion of the object or objects seen, but it is left blank.

I will now act as an OCR system and reproduce all the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

[Diagrams with A and B placements]

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The photograph in the document appears to be a scanned page of handwriting. Unfortunately, the image quality is poor, with streaks and high contrast making it difficult to clearly read the text. Nevertheless, I will attempt to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system to the best of my capacity and provide the text from the document. The text appears to be written in cursive and is quite faint, so some parts may be unreadable or interpreted incorrectly.

UNCLASSIFIED

Goose AFB, Labrador
15 December 1952

I. Description of Incident

Visual contact was made by two aircraft, a T-33 and an F-94, of an unidentified aerial object after being vectored to the target by GCA. The object had no definite shape, was bright red and white and was seen from 2315Z to 2310Z. Airborne visual contact was established as the F-94 entered the intercept area. No engine or jet exhaust was visible. The F-94 chased the object at an indicated airspeed of 375 knots but could not overtake it.

Weather was clear with visibility of 30 miles, winds at 10,000 ft. (altitude of the observing aircraft) was from 270° at 25 knots. The F-94 was on a heading of 270° while on its intercept run.

II. Discussion of Incident

Two C-54's from Goose AFB were in the area at the approximate time of sight-. One of these aircraft was observed by the F-94, the others was not. However, the unidentified object could not be the unobserved C-54 due to the speed factor. The F-94, at 375 knots, could have overtaken a C-54. There may have been a balloon launch at 2100Z from Goose AFB at Weather Service but here again there is a conflict because the object was sighted at 2315Z, two hours after launch. An astronomical explanation does not ring true since it is improbable that stars and meteors can be recorded by ground radar or airborne radar. Therefore, a plausible explanation for this sighting seems to be impossible.

III. Conclusion

Unknown.

To Whom It May Concern:

Possibly you may ignore this letter, disbelieve it, think it means nothing, has no value to interest you, deserves no particular consideration, or has no merit regarding your investigations. However, I would therewise, needless to say, or, I think, never have finally bothered to write to taken me fourteen years to decide to actually write this letter.

Being an actress by profession, for quite some time established in the public, with an accredited background, am more acutely aware than the average person of public reaction. Regarding the subject of this letter it would be claimed, among other things, that I'm seeking publicity; which is most untrue. Besides the public, I may be classified by your department as a "crack" or "kook-off"; I'm well aware that numerous people contacted you and quite generally are myd [?] that you and most instances, they no doubt define one category. Therefore, that is another one of the many reasons I've avoided writing you until now."

Before I begin the actual story I have
to tell you; I must state that my
previous remarks were for the fact
that I feel that end neglect to remain
unbeknown to you. For what I am to
relate important to you, but perhaps, what
I tell you may be.

About fourteen years ago around, 1952
I had a most unsettling actual-experien-
surpassed, what is morose, a day
called "Flying Saucers" or "U F O"; at That
Time it wasn't popular or common-
conversation. I can, also, assure you
it was the very last thing in my
mind I thought I might add out
more. Thing I have only had. That
one experienced, that long ago, acking,
once, in spite of the present day
rash of reports.

It was a week or two before
Christmas, 1952, I had gone Christmas
shopping in Hollywood, Calif. I had not
car at That time and. Traveled by bus;
I lived, and Still live in The same
place in North Hollywood, Calif.; I
arrived back where The bus stopped
at The corner of Ventura Blvd. and
Laurel N. H. Calif., approximately 9.30 P/M.
I stopped into The Corner Phone Booth
in junction with a gas station and
called home for someone to pick me up.
As I live about eight blocks away
from There. As I gathered my packages
and stepped out of The Phone Booth

I witnessed a sight I shall never forget. Even to this day, I have never heard or read any news report where anyone saw what I did as close or as clear or as long. No photograph nor description on my part, could ever do justice to my experience, nevertheless I endeavour an attempt to phrase it. Mildly, I saw: A tremendous, enormous, and huge object directly in front of me. It encompassed the whole lake & The corner of its edge is beyond reckoning. The tip seemed to be as high as anyone could see in the sky; however, the bottom was so low that it seemed it would have been possible able to be touched, if I could have been in about an eight story building & reached out to it. In shape, it was the most perfect roundness conceivable. To color, were or white, it was faintly a blue white. More or a silver diluted, so clear in color, there wasnt a speach [speck] or mark or shading in it. However it shone or slightly it seemed to glow with a luminous light. Aside from the delirious and explained, it reminded me of a full moon that had come down from the sky, enlarged incredibly and fallen into the atmosphere filling half the space in the air in front of me.

The bottom of it seemed just a little
above the tops- dwelling slightly there.

There was one more thing about its
appearance. From the very center
end of the left side of it there extended
a "rail" or "streak" straight out horizontally
some object pointing south of Ventuellabu
Cr. airport. The same clear color of the 
object itself - also, of the same substance
either part of the object or resulting from it.

It seemed absolutely still. Nothing
motionless and morbid, without sound
during the full length of the time
of a long red light (stop) traffic signal
by which I was then aware of. May-
one cannot have seen it (the airplanes)
as one were at a stop - 6 - 8 -12 cycle
of the corner. There was a lot of traffic
that season of the year.

About the time the traffic signal
turned green for the cars to go I was
suddenly aware the object was gone,
thought I was staring light at it. I
didn't see it move. I did, however,
see the "rail or streak" disappear over the
hills south of Ventura Blvd., thinking about it
sometime later I came to a personal
conclusion' that it must have moved
faster than the naked mortal eye 
could observe. Also, one more fact-
or: had it have done a sharp turn of 
an complete about face. Because all
that remained for me to observe until the

from Adelaide to Aden at 2120 G. M. T. December 8, 1952, in
lat. 9°42’ S., lon. 69°54’ E., he observed a meteor which first
appeared bearing 270° altitude 20°. It had a green spherical
head and a bright white trail of minor explosions. Three sec-
onds later, in bearing 250° altitude 10°, the meteor exploded
with a terrific bright green flash which lighted up the sky in the
west. A few minutes later a bright white flash was observed
briefly bearing 280° altitude 60°.

A cooperating observer reports that at 1051 G. M. T. December 15, 1952, in lat. 28°40' N., long. 164°14' E., he observed a large meteor which appeared bearing 277° altitude 80° and traveled horizontally in a northerly direction. It was first a brilliant white color for about 8 seconds and of such brilliance that the entire area was lit up and the vessel's superstructure cast shadows on the deck. The meteor then turned yellow gold and seemed to lose speed before disappearing behind a cloud, leaving no visible trail.
Weather cloudy, wind NW. force 4, barometer 30.25 inches, air temperature 68° F., sea temperature 73° F.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM LABRADOR
PROJECT NO.
IR-67-52                        PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. On 15 December 1952 at approximately 2331Z an unidentified flying object was sighted by aircrews of an F-94B, pilot Captain E. W. Johnson, and T-33
aircraft, pilot Lt. M. S. Morris, in flight about 10 to 20 miles West of Goose AB. Base, Labrador. The object was pursued for 25 minutes or until 2352Z when it faded at a distance of about 150 to 175 miles from base.

2. The description of this mysterious object as beyond the speed of 270 to 280 degrees from Goose AB, while at altitude varied from 1,000ft to 24,000 feet. The higher aircraft were travelling at about 375 knots at altitude and increase, but could not close; thus no estimate of the speed of the object could be made.

3. The object itself was observed to have two red/bright lights on the side, but faint to be red (which could have only been presumed at best) with small, ringing, or propulsion or rocket exhausts (very bright); no sound was heard, and the random stop. Head on its motion changed the shapes assumed one that too object shifted or actual maneuversability in making orbits like an “S” turns and smaller segments and ascents.

4. Although the object was observed visually, saw from operator in tug F-94B ascertained a moment [illegible]-on to an visual with MIT at first visual observation. It is considered possible that they both target during the period of time, although the radar observer’s “tail chase report was in agreement with the pilot's visual sighting.

5. No aerial photographs or GCI scope photographs were available. No gci contact was made with the object.

6. During the time of this sighting the following aircraft were in the
vicinity of C-54s and C-55s, and F-86s. One of these aircraft was silhouetted by the interceptors. The C-54 and word the report very unusual sighting from the Control Tower.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. Weather was CAVU with winds of 220/5 on the surface, 270/25 at 14,000
Feet, 250/25 at 24,000 feet; visibility 30 miles.

2. This incident is Captain Johnson’s second encounter with an unidentified flying object in the Goose Bay area in less than 30 days. He had visually two more sights on a similar object on 23 November. The main differences in the two reports are increased speed, and the degree of maneuverability. Captain Johnson is an experienced combat pilot with 1502 hours total flying including 650 hours in jets.

3. Lt. Morris is also an experienced pilot with 1379 hours flying time,
including 254 times in jets. A crew chief flying with Lt. Morris verified his account of the sighting.

4. Both aircrews, although debriefed separately, reported substantally the same visual observations.

6. Later panic this unidentified object was metal. No vapor trails, exhaust, 
or noise was notice. This case is carried as the FSD files as being due to
balloons, but observers assure a much more likely solution as view of the no-
ticeable speed and maneuvers.

7. In Riverside AB, Newfoundland, on 23 July 1952, six separate observations of
disc diameter borers of 500 yards, observed in flight, were reported. The 
Initial object which set off the series of observations was a reflecting
brilliant yellow craft a second two similar crafts of the same following a 
two mile retreat flew a pattern at 10 feet with the observers. Following 
this pattern of three, usually through 10 seconds, traveling at tremendous 
speeds in individual, flawless static maneuvers, these lights covered in 
varying numbers. Since lights were unidentifiable, but do yet vehicle that
they were unsure.

8. There is no case in the FSD files from any AC & W site in Northeastern 
during the month of July 1952.

9. At Goose Bay, Labrador, on 15 January 1952, piloted C-47 at 8000 feet a 
singly-developed, tubular passageway to close on a bright object. This object
was identified as an observer passing by.

10. There is no case in the FSD files from northern Michigan on 01
November 1951.

11. There were three cases from Goose on 09 December 1952:

A. At Okinate the 150-2000 hours a pilot attempted to close on object.

B. At Mme., a pilot received a UFO which was determined to have been 
due to the misidentification of an astronomical body.

C. At 1900-2005 there was an aerial observation of an unidentified 
flying object which was determined to be Venus.

12. There is no case in the FSD files from Europe on 19 April 1952.

13. On 08 February 1952 in the Amador mountains of an unknown observer an 
object's crew even now, blonde hair illustrated in color card below, were 
every were about 25" eyes in canines, and exhibited teardrop reflectanty to 
each Cherry observer. Why effective? This case is classified unclassified, 
but is still unsolved: the reptile was due to the nonidentifitication of 
common terrestrial ice vapor Vesicles.

14. UFO reported area Past April 1 identified as a C-47.

15. There is no case in the FSD files at Great Waves on 17 February 1953.
