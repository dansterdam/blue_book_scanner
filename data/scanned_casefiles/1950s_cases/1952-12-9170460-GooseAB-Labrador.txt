1. The following information was furnished by the Commanding Officer, Goose
Air Base, Labrador on the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

2. On 26 November 1952 at 2155Z, an unidentified flying object was sighted
by an F-94B pilot assigned to the 59th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron stationed at
Goose Air Base while in aerial flight in the immediate Goose Air Base area.

3. The object was first observed by both the pilot and radar observer of
the F-94B over Goose Air Base, then it followed a course of 1900 for approximately
40 miles. The altitude of the object varied from 150 to 12,000 feet; estimated
speed 350 to 425 knots, with a general direction of flight between South and
Southwest. No definite shape or size was noted; observing aircraft: Color
reported as bright orange-red with light blue-green. No jet or rocket exhausts
were noted; no sound was heard, and the manner of propulsion was unknown. Object
displayed excellent maneuvering as it followed friendly aircraft in steep banks
and turns. Always maintaining the same relative distance from aircraft, speeds
were synchronized until object disappeared at 2211Z.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. Intercept was attempted by F-94B aircraft but object maintained same
relative distance. At this time of the year, "Northern Lights" and other
phenomena peculiar to the Arctic and Sub-Arctic are prevalent which seems to
substantiate the reason why the friendly aircraft could not close any distance
with the object despite violent maneuvering.

2. Weather conditions encompassing the sighting period was CAVIJ; wind from
NW 215° at 15 to 20 knots.

3. There was no activity, meteorological or otherwise, which might account
for the sighting.

4. Other aircraft in the area during the sighting period were C-124, DC-3,
and Canadian Northstar. Pilot of the F-94B stated he observed and identified the
above aircraft at one time or another.

5. Pilot is an experienced combat pilot with 1800 hours total time, of which
650 hours is jet time.

Goose AFB, Labrador                                                15 December 1952

I.   Description of Incident

Visual contact was made by two aircraft, a T-33 and an F-94l, of an unidentified aerial object after being vectored to the target by GCI. The object had no definite shape, was bright red and white and was seen from 231½ to 231½°. Airborne visual contact was established as soon as the F-94l entered the intercept area. No engine or jet exhaust was visible. The F-94l chased the object an an indicated airspeed of 375 knots but could not overtake it.

Weather was clear with visibility of 30 miles, winds at 14,000 ft. (altitude of the observing aircraft) was from 270° at 25 knots. The F-94l was on a heading of 270° while on its intercept run.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Two C-54's from Goose AFB were in the area at the approximate time of sighting. One of these aircraft was observed by the F-94l, the other was not. However, the unidentified object could not be the unobserved C-54l due to the speed factor. The F-94l, at 375 knots, could have overtaken a C-54l. There may have been a balloon launch at 2100Z from Goose. Air Weather Service could find no explanation. An astronomical explanation does not ring true since it is improbable that stars and meteors can be recorded by ground radar at 2100Z. Therefore, a plausible explanation for this sighting seems to be impossible.

III. Conclusion

Unknown.

To Whom It May Concern:

Possibly you may ignore this letter. Undoubtedly, you think it means nothing, has no value to interest you, deserves no particular consideration, or has no merit, regarding your investigations. However, I think otherwise, needless to say, or I would never have finally gathered to write you.

It's taken me fourteen years to decide to actually write this letter.

Being an actress by profession, for quite some time established in the public, with an accredited background, I am more acutely aware than the average person of public reaction. Regarding the subject of this letter, it would be candid, among other things, that "I'm seeking publicity." Besides the public, I am well aware that a "kook" or "crackpot" department that numerous people control, that you are well aware and many instances are typed. These, no doubt, deserve another category. Therefore, that is another reason I'm avoiding writing you until now.

Before I begin the actual story I have to tell you, I must state that my previous remarks were for the fact that I both wish and request, to remain unknown to you. For who I am is not important to you, but perhaps, what I tell you may be.

About fourteen years ago around 1952 I had a most startling actual experience regarding what is now - as I call it "Flying Saucers" or "UFO", at that time it wasn't popular or common conversation. I can, also, assure you that nothing more thing I have might add one experience, that long ago, nothing since, in spite of the present day rash of reports.

It was a week or two before Christmas 1952. I had gone Christmas shopping in Hollywood, Calif. I was at that time and traveled by bus. Plainly, and still live in the San Arno North Hollywood, Calif. I arrived at the corner where the bus stopped through N. H. and Ventura Blvd. and I stepped into the corner phone booth, appropriately 9:30 P.M. in conjunction with a gas station and checked home for someone to pick me up. From there, about eight blocks away, and stepped out of the phone booth.

I witnessed a sight I shall never forget. Even to this day, I have never heard or read any news report where anyone saw what I did as close or as clear on as long, etc.

Through my description, on my part, could ever do justice to my experience, nevertheless I'll endeavor an attempt.

To phrase it mildly, I saw a tremendous, enormous, and huge object directly in front of me. It uncompassed the whole area of the corner. Its size is beyond explaining. The top seemed to be as high as anyone could see in the sky, however, the bottom was so low that it seemed it would have been possibly able to be touched, if I could have been in about an eight story building and reached out to it. In shape, it was the most perfect roundness conceivable. Its color was white, it was faintly a blue white. More on a silver white, so clear in color, there wasn't a speck or mark or shading in it. However it shone so brightly it seemed to glow with a luminous light. Aside from the deviation I'll explain, it reminded me of a full moon that had come down from the sky, enlarged or vastly and fallen into the atmosphere filling all the space in the air in front of me.

The custom of it seemed just a little along the corn building existing their appearance. From the very center of the left side to a "till" or "streak" straight out horizontally some sloped. Pointing south of Ventura Blvd. It appeared the same clear color of the object itself. Also, of the same substance either part of the object or resulting from it. It seemed absolutely still. However, motionless and mobile, without sound, during the full length of the time of it watching. Yet - eight (stop) half original of watching 9 was then different. Many due cannot have seen it. On both parts of the corner. There was a lot of traffic.

About the time the traffic signal turned green for the car to go I was suddenly aware - the object was gone, though I was staring right at it. I did, however, see the "till or streak" disappear over the hills south of Ventura Blvd. Thinking about it sometime later I came to a personal conclusion that it must have moved faster than the naked mortal eye could observe. Also, one more fact. It had to have done a sharp turn of an complete about face. Because all that remained for me to observe was the disappearing streak, which now

Third Officer C. H. Chandler of the British S.S. Muncaster Castle, Capt. A. G. Gorham, Master, reports that while on passage from Adelaide to Aden at 2120 G. M. T. December 8, 1952, in lat. 9°42' S., lon. 69°64' E., he observed a meteor which first appeared bearing 270° altitude 20°. It had a green spherical head and a bright white trail of minor explosions. Three seconds later, in bearing 250° altitude 10°, the meteor exploded with a terrific bright green flash which lighted up the sky in the west. A few minutes later a bright white flash was observed briefly bearing 230° altitude 60°.

Weather partly cloudy, slight easterly breeze, slight sea and low swell, barometer 29.90 inches, air temperature 85° F., sea temperature 88° F.

NORTH PACIFIC

A cooperating observer reports that at 1051 G. M. T. December 15, 1952, in lat. 28°40' N, lon. 166°14' E, he observed a large meteor which appeared bearing 277° altitude 80° and traveled horizontally in a northerly direction. It was first a brilliant white color for about 3 seconds and of such brilliance that the entire area was lit up and the vessel's superstructure cast shadows on the deck. The meteor then turned yellow gold and seemed to lose speed before disappearing behind a cloud, leaving no visible trail.

Weather cloudy, wind NW. force 4, barometer 80.25 inches, air temperature 68° F., sea temperature 73° F.

A cooperating observer reports that at 1630 G. M. T. 15 December 1952, in lat. 54°07' N, lon. 166°20' W., he observed a meteor of an intense blue color with a white streaming tail. It appeared in altitude 35° bearing 225° and disappeared in altitude 18°.

The following night at 0857 G. M. T. 16 December 1952 he observed another meteor, bright green with a brilliant white center, which appeared in altitude 50° bearing 260° and disappeared in altitude 16° bearing 265°.

Weather clear, very good visibility, moderate sea, barometer 29.78 inches, air temperature 29° F.

AF FORM 112-PART II                                UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Dir/Int, MSAC                                       TR-67-52                                PAGE 2 OF 2

1. On 15 December 1952 at approximately 2315Z an unidentified flying object was sighted by aircraft of 556 AEW&C Sqdn. Capt. B. W. Johnson, and Lt. H. J. Morris, pilot Lt. H. J. Morris, in T-33 aircraft, while flying at 23,000 ft. in the Goose Air Base, Labrador, Canada area, were vectored at a distance of about 70 to 80 miles NNW of Goose Air Base.

2. The direction of flight was generally east on a heading of 270 to 280 degrees. The aircraft were flying at about 23,000 feet. The fighter aircraft were flying at about 375 knots at 24,000 feet but could not close; thus no estimate of the speed of the object could be made.

3. The object itself was a pointed to have no particular size or shape, but first visual contact was with a white, bright object which was very bright. No jet or rocket exhaust was noted; no sound was heard, and the camera gun film was blank. The object gave an indication of high maneuverability in making gentle banks and turns and a high rate of ascent.

4. Although the object was observed visually, the F-94B equipped a momentary "lock-on" to an unknown target in the same general location. It is considered possible that the "lock-on" was due to the altitude line, although the entire observer's data indicates visual sighting.

5. No aerial photo or GCI scope shots were made while in the vicinity. No GCI contact was made with the object.

6. During the time of the sighting the following aircraft were in the vicinity: C-54, F-94, and F-86. One of these aircraft was at 24,000 feet in the general area.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. Weather was CAVU with winds of 220/5 on the surface, 270/25 at 24,000 feet; visibility 30 miles.

2. This incident is Capt. Johnson's second encounter with an unidentified object in the Goose Air Base area. He has had a similar object sighting at a similar location. Capt. Johnson is an experienced space pilot and the degree of maneuverability. Capt. Johnson is considered to be a reliable, professional pilot.

3. The radar is also an experienced pilot with 1,570 hours total time, including 250 hours in jets.

4. Both observers, although identified separately, reported substantially the same view.

Here is the text from the document:

6. Later period six identical objects were noted. No vapor trails, exhaust, or sound was noted. This case is a careful 3 mile UFO case to be considered.

7. At Patrick AFB, Florida, on 18 July 1952, six unidentified observations of unidentified objects which did not give rise to conventional explanation was a participant in the investigation. These objects were observed by several persons and were plotted on a chart. These 14-pts which were observed for about 15-20 minutes were tracked by radar and visually. These 16-20m compared in speed to satellites (which were unknown).

8. Here is no case in the PUD files from any AG & W site in Michigan during the month of July 1952.

9. At Goose Bay, Labrador, on 18 December 1952, pilots of a B-29 and a B-29-45 observed, with two passengers, to close on a bright object. The object was identified as a navigational body.

10. There is no case in the PUD files from northern Michigan on 24 November 1951.

11. There were three cases from Japan on 29 December 1952:
    a. At Chitose at 1530-2000 hours a pilot observed a close on Jupiter.
    b. At Miawa 2 miles reported a UFO which was determined to have been due to the misidentification of an astronomical body.
    c. At 1830-2030 there was an aerial observation of an unidentified flying object with two witnesses.

12. There is no case in the PUD files from Japan on 19 April 1952.

13. On 26 September 1952 in the Azores sector of an airway over Portugal two aircraft were involved. Pilots of a B-29 and another aircraft reported they were about 20° to 30° in azimuth and had observed their relationship to the other aircraft. This case was evaluated as probably due to the misidentification of an astronomical body.

14. UFO reported from York still unidentified on a C-47.

15. There is no case in the PUD files from Korea on 7 February 1953.
