                                                                                    Tiburon, California

Case 201, Tiburon, Cal., Aug. 26, 1956—By letter James Geer tells of his experience as follows: "About 7:30 this evening, while driving home, I noticed what appeared to be a flock of nine small birds flying northward. They were dark against the blue sky and were all about the same size, although, being able to watch only in glances, I can not estimate their size or shape. They flew in a clump, without rigid formation, moving freely among themselves like birds, although their general course seemed straight. I believed they were birds until they passed behind a nearby hill. Measuring with my car speedometer, I found the distance between the point of observation and a point closely approximating the top of the hill to be one mile. They made the arc of about 60 degrees in about five seconds. Allowing for an error of 100% on the distance of the objects and another error of 100% on the angle, these objects, in order to pass just behind the hill, had to be traveling at least 90 mph. If my estimates are more nearly correct, however, and the objects were not just behind the hill but over the bay at, say two miles distance, they were traveling well over 1000 mph. There is no chance that the objects passed in front of the hill. The objects were quite dark and the hill a bright amber."

Sometimes an observer identifies such objects correctly, but later begins to doubt his own judgment. About 7:30 in the evening of August 26, 1956, a man driving along a highway in California noticed a flock of about nine small birds flying northward, dark against the blue sky. In a random group, they moved freely among themselves as birds do but continued in a northern direction. The witness watched the birds as carefully as possible, but the intermittent glimpses possible when a man is driving a car did not allow him to make good estimates of their size or height. Nevertheless, he guessed at their distance and calculated that they covered an arc of 60 degrees in five seconds, which would mean a speed of about 1000 miles an hour.

Instead of questioning the accuracy of his estimate, for some reason he doubted his first identification. If the objects could fly 1000 miles an hour, he reasoned, then they were not birds after all, and must be flying saucers! [13]

23 Aug, 1956

RCAF JET PILOT REPORT
A former RCAF jet pilot, now Aviation Editor of the Toronto Telegram, has notified NICAP of a UFO sighting he had in 1956, while setting a cross-Canada speed record.
Sqdn. Ldr. Robert J. Childerhose also submitted a black-and-white print of a color slide he took of the object, while cruising seven miles over the Canadian Rockies. The picture is being analyzed by a NICAP photographic advisor, and will be reported on later.

The incident occurred on Aug. 23, 1956, when Squadron Ldr. Childerhose and Flt. Lt. Ralph Annis were speeding westward. The UFO appears as a very bright, oblong shape with fuzzy out-line in the picture, but is described as having been "sharply defined to the naked eye."

A second picture, taken a few minutes later from above storm clouds at 47,000 feet, showed that the UFO had remained stationary.

Case 202, Fairhaven, Mass., Aug. 27, 1956—Miss Norma Mello tells of an observation made by her aunt and uncle. She writes: "At about 3:25 a.m., Mrs. W. Bence was startled by a brilliant light coming through the east window. The light had not been there 25 minutes earlier when Mr. Bence had awakened. The object, which was motionless, appeared to be about the size of a grapefruit and was quite low on the horizon. Mr. Bence went outdoors to watch the object and saw a small reddish light to the right of it. There was no sound. Mr. and Mrs. Bence continued watching it until it faded away, about one-half hour later. Twenty-five minutes later, Mrs. Bence looked again and the object was back, although not as bright. At this time it began to move horizontally back and forth in the same area. About 5 a.m., Mrs. Bence faded away as it into a mist."

Case 203, Eureka, Cal, Aug. 30, 1956—The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported, three persons saw a "meteor" early Thursday as they drove toward Eureka. One observer said it was the biggest fireball he had ever seen, and that it lit the highway as bright as day.11

Case 204, Williamstown, Ky. 11:30 pm, Aug. 30, 1956—Driving south toward Williamstown, the Research Director of a Cincinnati manufacturer saw a large brilliant oval-shaped object in the horizon. "It was so low," she said, "it looked as though it were going to hit the ground." The object, oval-shaped and as large as a dime held at arm's length, looked "green on one side and white on the other"—but she said the speed was so great that the true colors were indistinguishable. Noticeable, however, was a bright halation or glow around the object. Another witness, and a friend of the Research Director, was also driving south about a block behind when she saw the same object. Her description tallied, and she agreed that the object seemed to be slanting in toward earth.

Case 205, Cincinnati, Ohio, 10:05 p.m., Aug. 30, 1956—
A prominent lawyer phoned the writer describing a single white light zigzagging to the north as though it were "following a heavily saw". Its flight was jerky, he said, like a "boat being rowed in thrusts upon the water" and rhythmically it flickered off and on—pulsing no sound. The object disappeared into infinity...

Case 206, Cincinnati, Ohio, 6 pm, Aug. 31, 1956—
Harry Baston driving in heavy traffic was stopped long enough to get a good glimpse of a solid device shaped like a mushroom. He said the object was intensely white and quite large in the clear sky and was traveling in a straight line to the south. At one time the object seemed to fade out, said Baston, but reappeared still traveling south looking much smaller.

Notes. NO CASE INFORMATION OKAY.
Letter received by Dr Hynek from—
24 hand report of observation in 1956 or 1957.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This letter is in answer to your inquiry about the experience I had a few years ago on a sighting. The "story on flying saucers being sighted in various parts of the United States had already become fairly well known. I personally must admit I looked upon this subject with skepticism and general disbelief. Then this happened:

On or about August 20, 1956 or '57 (it is hard to pinpoint the exact date now, but it was the first Monday of the Minn. State Fair) I was driving home the last newsboy from the State Fair Trip, I had a group of six boys to return home to town from White Bear to Stillsey. At about 11:30 P. M. while nearing his home, we suddenly saw, (and for awhile I considered it to be a false image of a so-called 'flying saucer') a large object 'consisting' in the sky along side of me, keeping at a perfect parallel to the ground, since it was right, I was unable to get a positive perspective of this object, but guessed it to be about a mile or two away from us. The boy with me became extremely frightened, and I must admit, so was I. The object appeared to be about a mile or two away from us. The approximate object's position to be about a house and a half-block long. Then, it came to a stop and 'parked' right in the sky. By then I had stopped the car also, and we both watched in amazement. I was able to get my wits about me again and I looked at it in a more observing attitude. The fright somewhat left me too, since the object no longer appeared to be a threat. I was able to make a visual description of it in my mind. I forgot what I was viewing. The shape of the object was 'impossible' to by estimation as it appeared too blunt to be able to travel as fast as it did when it left. Instead of the ends being tapered to a point, it appeared blunt, as to be small and off on edge. There was a dome-like structure or bulge on the top about 2/3 as long as the over-all length, but in proportion to the entire structure, it was not very high. I was almost sure I was able to see inside of the dome, yet I saw nothing other then this huge blunt-shaped object, glowing in a definite amber-red, with a narrow haze encircling its entirety. When it left, briefly, its top speed after the initial thrust was made. I heard no noise at any time during this sighting. I brought the boy home, telling him, "Don't let anybody you saw an unusual reflection of some sort." Later I felt I may have handled it incorrectly but he was so frightened I thought it best to minimize it then.

About 2 hours later I was home, having decided to erase the incident from my mind, not even letting my wife know of it. She was awake and seemed something was wrong and thought I had experienced being at the scene of an accident. I have tried close to a million miles by car in the past 20 years of newspaper work, about 1/4 of it being after dark. In all of this driving, I have not had any other experience that I did not have a natural, or local explanation, and I would certainly like to find one for this.

Sincerely,

At about 11:30 P.M. while nearing his home, we suddenly saw (and I was able to consider) a so-called "flying saucer") a large object 'coasting' in the sky along side of me, keeping at a perfect parallel to the ground, since it was night, I was unable to get a positive perspective of this object, but guessed it to be about a mile or two away from us. The boy with me became extremely frightened, and I must admit, so was I. The object appeared to be about a mile or two away from us, the magnitude of a 3 story house and about half-block long. Then, it came to a stop and 'parked' right in sky. By then I had stopped the car also, and we both watched in amazement. I was able to get my camera about me again and looked at it in a more observing attitude. The fright somewhat left me too, since the object no longer appeared to be a threat. I was able to make a visual description of it in my mind so as not to forget what I was viewing. The shape of the object was 'impossible' to my estimation as it appeared too blunt to be able to travel as fast as it did when it left.

Case 197, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, Aug. 21, 1956—For twenty minutes, six vacationers watched three strange objects cavoring over the Atlantic Ocean. First in view, as seen from the beach, were two brilliant white lights which, according to one witness, seemed to be playing

tag. Un-aircraft-like maneuvers included dipping in- and out of the ocean. Later a third object appeared on the scene. It was larger, round and red and became stationary.

None of the objects made sound.

Case 196, Los Angeles, CA, Aug. 21, 1956—A letter from Vivian Machu relates: "My father saw a ball of fire traveling across the sky at about 8:15 p.m., in a straight horizontal course. After his report, my cousin and I went out on balcony to look, and in 45 minutes, having seen nothing we went to bed. Five minutes later we saw a fireball and rushing outside we were in time to see it completely reverse direction without turning or stopping. It was heading north one moment, and the next, it was heading south. It accelerated more going south and went over a plane that was coming in. It passed the plane, changed directions again and got over the plane. The next moment, both the bell of fire and the plane vanished. I noticed that a much smaller ball of fire followed the plane, and two others were underneath. My cousin said the didn't notice this."

Ed: The L.A. Times reported "other flying stuff" for the same evening. Police reports said folks saw an orange-red object close to the edge of the moon about 9:30 p.m. Others saw an associated object of elongated shape, which appeared to be bathed in the glare of spotlight and to be going up and over like an elevator. Valley Division police were told of a "missile" seen cruising across San Fernando Valley skies. Of concern to the writer is what Viviane meant when she said the plane vanished. Our guess is that it disappeared into horizon rather than into a fireball.

Case 198, New Orleans, La, 8:35 p.m., Aug. 23, 1956—
Richard Hall writes: "We have been on sky watch for
several nights because of increase in UFO reports, and
to view Mars and the moon with a 4" reflector telescope.
We had seen several meteors and were familiarizing ourselves with the appearance of planes at night, too high
to be heard. Earlier, we had seen two or three such
planes, so we were not startled to see an orange dot of
light exactly resembling a plane moving overhead. I
raised the binoculars and commenced that I could see no
wing lights. I noted the object in relation to a bright
star and continued to watch from my comfortable lawn
chair. Abrupty, the object made a 180 degree turn
which brought me out of my chair. Then it made another
180 degree turn, with no apparent color change and continued to the NE. It proceeded about 20 degrees across
the sky, then suddenly began a series of violent maneuvers, impossible to reconstruct. At this point, the object
repeatedly blacked out or disappeared, returning momentarily as a flash of green light. It zigzagged and flitted
here and there in impossible changes of direction. Gradually, the field of motion diminished and the object was
nearly stationary in a thin haze layer toward the NE.
I lost sight of it when I tried to locate it in the finder
scope of the telescope, and we didn't see it again. Using
the star it passed, and the landmark above which it was
last seen, I estimated that it traversed a minimum of 45°
to 50° of arc. The sighting lasted 25 seconds or more".

Case 199, Torrance, Cal., Aug. 23, 1956—Headlined the Torrance Press: "15 Guardsmen See Flying Saucer".

Their convoy was just returning from maneuvers. Among those who observed the UFO was Capt. Douglas Horlander, C.O. of Co. B, 132nd Armored Engineer Battalion.

Said Capt. Horlander, "It was 6:10 p.m. Our convoy was about six miles north of Santa Barbara at Goleta. We were going about 25 mph. I was sitting in the front seat of the jeep, half asleep. Suddenly, M/Sgt. William Lyons tapped me on the shoulder. 'Hey, Cap,' he said, 'I've been watching this thing.' I looked up, and there I saw this round object standing perfectly still at about 1000 ft. elevation. It was round and shiny like the top of a tin can. It looked like the sun, only the sun was coming from another direction. First, I thought it was a blimp. It was at a 45 degree angle from us, toward the left. All at once it zoomed sideways and then instantly up to about 5000 ft. at a right angle, like the beam of a flashlight. Then I thought it was a weather balloon, but suddenly it came down again to a 2000 ft. elevation. We saw the object for about eight minutes before it disappeared. This happened just as it was time to halt the convoy. Some of the men had seen the object, too. To look at them, you'd think they'd seen a ghost." Added the Captain, "We spotted the thing close to Pt. Mugu, the Naval Guided Missile Testing Station. I think the flying saucer belongs to us." Said Sgt. Lyons, "I think it was possibly from outer space. I don't think we have anything like it."
