UFO Case -- 13 May 1957

Observed by unidentified aircraft when short of runway type of aircraft may be judged out NIKE - a box as he object to 070 from delta flight in SE direction path observed 4 years.

Clearance: At check of Aero Chart H 4/6/1 shows that ground's location was different to 1st ranges, running NW - SE (10. Red 1, clearing 127° approach with "turning" at 134° 11' its plotted on the chart. Some 900 miles from flying object. Approximately 900 with the 75 degree angle of elevation that would be required to see object.

Sketch: [A hand-drawn sketch with various lines and annotations, including "SAN ANGELO", "OBSERVED", "RED", "TRAFFIC PATTERN", "AIRWAY ROUTE"]

Therefor: Some possibly seen as an aircraft, with the high-set approach and the plane of the * - attitude to partly am near - active imagination and the known inability of eyes to judge time and velocity. The fact some were completely cloud at the time to sustain greater - slightly and some cloud.
