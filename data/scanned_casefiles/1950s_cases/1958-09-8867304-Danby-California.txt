STATEMENT

Last fall about the last of September three of us were standing at the hill at railroad Danby. We saw a strong glow of light coming from the foothills of the Clipper Mtns. We thought this to be a bank of fog. This intense glow lasted about 20 minutes. It was approximately 4 miles from where we were standing. Time 4 a.m. We watched it and discussed what it could be, but it was no high bank and it was something that didn't look natural. The next day 13 happened again at the same time and lasted about 20 minutes. Until the sun had moved and the glow went out, however this time there was no wind. We watched it through a telescope. Under the glass the glow was gone and two cylindrical shaped, round nosed, glowing objects were parked in a large deep gulley. They were about 40' apart sitting approximately north and south. They were both a very dull silvery color like giant gas bottles. We thought at first it was a crashed airliner. The next morning we went out and searched the area, and found nothing. At 4 p.m. we again watched at RR Danby to see the glow but it did not occur again. They had left during the night. I am quite sure I can almost pinpoint the place if I return to the area.

STATEMENT

Around the end of September two other men and I were standing at Nicholson's Mill talking about processing when we noticed a glow in the direction of Clipper Kline. We watched the glow for a while and then it disappeared.

Later that night we talked about it and decided to watch for it the next day. The next day it appeared again at the same time. We knew there was nothing available in that area and though it might be an airplane because of its metallic glow. My companion took his telescope and looked at it and spotted it on the hillside. We drove as far as possible and walked for three or four hours in the general area. The exact spot was on a line from RR Danby northwest over Route 66 Danby. We aligned ourselves with the two places and searched the area but could not find evidence of the objects. I remembered a few days later that the objects were visible almost every day in the same area so I and I investigated further. We used a powerful pair of binoculars and studied the glow. We noticed guy wires coming from it and looked closer and saw rods radiating from the guy wires. We remembered that two tall radio antennas used by the California Highway Patrol were at Route 66 Danby and determined that the gun cart, a railroad curve, the antennas and that was what we were looking at all the time and that was why we could find no evidence in the foothills.

We did not report this information and thought the whole thing had been solved.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. This report is a result of message AFCIN-484, 3-432-3 dated 091308 MAR 59.

2. Investigators interviewed in Los Angeles, California on 11 March 1959, and in Danby, California on 12 March 1959.

3. Investigators made a search of the area pointed out by Sources as the spot where objects were seen. (Refer to Incl 1, PART FOUR). Overlay of area. No evidence could be found that resembled the description of the objects or were any factors could have been in the area.

Investigators went to Richolson's Kill and observed the area through 7x50 binoculars. SOURCES stated the objects around approximately 1600 hours PBR. Weather conditions were identical to that of the original sighting.

SOURCES stated that 100 hours PBR the objects appeared. SOURCES stated that the sun may have been in a different seasonal elevation at the time of the original sighting. SOURCES also stated that the objects had not been seen for quite some time. A close study of the sight line revealed the outline of an isosceles and guy wires described in SOURCES statement in PART TWO. (Refer to Incl 2, PART FOUR, Cross section of sight line). Antenna provided over trees tops at route 66 Danby approximately twenty (20) feet. Antennas were:

Antenna stacked yagi type. Antennas were sited parallel to Route 66 or 045 degrees. This angle would approximate the direction to Needles, California (EWTR 2150) Two (2) antenna visible approximately twenty (20) feet apart. Antenna approximately forty (40) feet. Antennas approximately four (4) feet square.

DANBY, CALIFORNIA
2 October 1958

On 6 March 1959, this Center received a letter from a resident of Los Angeles, California reporting the sighting of an unusual object. The limited information contained in the letter was insufficient to allow analysis. A request for investigation was made to a unit directly associated with the organization which falls under the jurisdiction of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. The following is a summary of the information derived, and the final conclusions reached concerning this incident.

On 2 October 1958, three men were standing at Richeleau's Tungsten Mill at Railroad Danby discussing prospecting. The time was approximately 1600 hours PST, when what appeared to be a bright glow, or flash of light, in the northwest was observed. One man said it was to be an reflection off mice. The other two didn't think there was that much significance in that area because they had prospected the area in the past. The glow was in view for two and one half hours and then disappeared when the sun lowered in the sky.

The next day at the same time the glow of light reappeared in the same location. Two of the observers looked at it with a small telescope and the glow appeared to be oblong as is an aircraft fuselage, and the color of aluminum. The size of the object appeared to be approximately 15 feet long, 5 feet high, and solid. The distance to the object was estimated to be about four miles. The three men drove as far as they could toward the object and walked around the area for three or four hours, but could find no evidence of such an object.

A few days later one man remembered that the object, or glow, was visible almost every day in the same areas. Two of the men decided to investigate further. They took a pair of powerful binoculars, studied the object, and noticed guy wires coming from it. Upon looking closer, rods were seen radiating from the guy wires. They then remembered that two tall radio antennas used by the Blyway Patrol were located at Highway 66, Railroad Danby and decided the sun was reflecting off these antennas.

Air Force investigation confirmed the views of the witnesses. The antennas were found to protrude above the tree tops approximately 20 feet, and were examined approximately 20 feet. It was determined that the reflection from these antennas could be seen from Railroad Danby only during a relatively short period of the year for the hour of this report. This explains why the sighting appeared unusual to the witnesses of the area.

It is concluded that the cause of this sighting was the sun reflecting off radio antennas.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER

In view of observations made by SOURCES at Danby and by the two investigators, an evaluation of probable optical illusion caused by sun reflections on radio antennae is given this report. It is felt that Los Angeles SOURCES would have been given the time for further investigation as did the other observers.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The bright sun reflected at a particular time from an object invisible to the observer often produces a puzzling phenomenon, such as the flying saucer reported from Danby, California, early in October 1958.

About 4:00 in the afternoon on October 2, three prospectors standing near a tungsten mill at Railroad Danby noticed a sudden bright glow in the northwest sky which remained visible for about 2½ hours and then disappeared. When a glow appeared again the following day at the same time and place, the observers tried to identify it by using a small telescope and saw a bright, oblong object hovering above the horizon; it was the color of aluminum, approximately fifteen feet long, five feet high, and about four miles away. Getting into a car, the men drove in the direction of the object and searched the supposed location on foot for several hours, but could find no trace of the UFO.

Several days later, realizing that the object reappeared every day at about the same time and place, two of the men decided to investigate further. Studying the object through a pair of powerful binoculars, they could see guy wires coming from it and rods radiating from the guy wires. Remembering that two tall radio antennas used by the highway patrol stood in approximately the same location, the witnesses found the explanation, which Air Force investigators confirmed. The antennas, placed some twenty feet apart, extended about twenty feet above the trees. The circumstances of a special effect depending on a particular combination of circumstances: only during the first part of October, and only late in the afternoon, did the sun's rays strike the antenna in such a way that the reflection was visible to an observer at Railroad Danby [1]:

DEAR SIR,

I AM NOT SURE THIS WILL EVER & YOU BUT AS THINGS STAND NO ONE SEE TO WRITE TO REPORT ANY THING TO THESE DAYS THOUGH IT MAY BE IMPORTANT. NOW KNOW VERY WELL THAT WHAT OUR COUNTRY'S ENEMIES ARE & HOW THAT JUDGE OUR VERY NERVE. IT HAPPENS THAT THEN IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE THINGS HAPPENING. I HOPE TO AN GIVE IT THE PROPER JUDGEMENT I THINK IT DESIRES.

MAYBE YOU DONT KNOW IT WELL I TELL YOU NOT IF YOU START AT DANBY WHERE IT IS LOCATED AND DRAW A GREAT CIRCLE COURSE N.W. 75 MI. IT PASSES THRU CAMP IRWIN, RAND'S U.S. NAVAL ORDNANCE STATION (NEAR) ADJACENT TO EACH OTHER. THEN A MISSILE FALLS AND YOU PASS OVER INTO NORTH RUSSIA. YOUR RECENT STATEMENTS TO CONGRESS ABOUT OUR DANGER ARE NOT LIKE TO TAKE A CHANCE AND JUST TO WRITE ABOUT IT. I COULD MEAN SOMETHING ELSE.

OR JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE GUESSES THAT SOMETIMES HAPPEN. BETTER YET MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE A SENSIBLE EXPLANATION. I HOPE SO.

I saw it again and I cleared it with the mill. Then he told me it had been there for weeks. I looked so dazzling and pretty we just stood there the two of us and watched it. That I suddenly remembered I had a telescope in my pickup truck. I ran and got it and by laying it up against the old car dump truck body I looked right out. I saw and traced this glass the great silver like aluminum body with a rounded nose like a large aluminum painted 6"s little.
