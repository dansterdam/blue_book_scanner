Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 20 October 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object.

This sighting is much too old to accomplish an investigation and evaluation at this late date.

For your information I am inclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet, dated 6 October 1958, on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

Dear Sir

A few years ago I saw an object near my home that looked like a parachute. I ran toward where I thought it would land. But then it started going up, and then started toward me, tumbling as it came. It stopped almost right above me, and then started going to its right very slowly. I could run and keep up with it, but then all of a sudden it shot up toward the sun, and that was the last I saw of it.

The reason I wrote so late is that I did not know who to talk to. I saw this address in the book "Secrets of Space Flight".

More information below...
