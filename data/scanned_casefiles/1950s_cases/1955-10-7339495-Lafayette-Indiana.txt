Dear Mr. ---, 
This is to acknowledge your letter of 20 October 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object. 
This sighting is much too old to accomplish an investigation and verification at this late date.
For your information I am including the latest Department of the Air Force Report on the subject of unidentified flying objects. 
Sincerely,
Major J. L. Tacker,
Public Information Division,
Office of Information Services.

Lafayette, Louisiana

The image contains a photograph or diagram showing the shape and details of a UFO sighting. The text accompanying the image provides more information about the sighting, including the date, time, size, shape, and speed of the object observed. The observer described the object as metallic in color and faster than any jet they had seen. The observation lasted 2 to 3 minutes under fair sky conditions.

Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir

A few years ago I saw an object near my home that looked like a parachute, I ran toward where I thought it would land. But then it started going up, and then started toward me, tumbling as it came. It stopped almost right above me, and then started going to its right very slowly. I could run and keep up with it, but then all of a sudden it shot up toward the sun, and that was the last I saw of it. 

The reason I wrote so late is that I did not know who to tell this to until I saw this address in the book "Secrets of Space Flight".
