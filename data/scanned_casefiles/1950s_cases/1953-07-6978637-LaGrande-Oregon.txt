They state that Lowry Plotting Center was contacted for Moby Dick information through Lowry Flight Service Center. The Plotting Center gave the following information, quote, Lowry Plotting Center reported Moby Dick balloon to be one hundred and twenty miles south of LaGrande, Ore., at 0121Q PST, July 53, altitude 53,000 ft. Observation of the balloon is not substantiated by the plots of Moby Dick balloons received from your organization for 1 July 53.

Comments of Preparing Officer

Report contains information concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object by a naval aircraft over La Grande, Oregon on 6 June 1953. An F-94 fighter aircraft from McChord AFB, Washington was vectored to investigate the object. The object was described as round, white, and moving at high speed. No trail was observed. No other personnel of tactical air command or air defense command posts were informed of the incident. It is estimated that the whole incident would be 10 minutes after receipt of information from the Seattle AARTC Center. It is my belief that the date of reports 2 July 1953, should read 6 July 1953.

SUBJECT    DATE     4-600D   4-28-53
FLYOUT   L-1   PAGE   2   OF   2   PAGES
Observers account of sightings:
Between 5:30 and 6 p.m. on April 28, 1953, four witnesses observed a light in the sky which appeared to be a white or luminous ball of some kind. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and was seen at an elevation of about 35 or 40 degrees above the horizon. The object was stationary and did not follow a straight course or change in altitude during the observation. The object was very bright and appeared to wink out or go dark suddenly and disappear from view. The witnesses stated that the object could not have been an airplane, balloon, or any other conventional aircraft and the description did not fit any familiar object to them.
It was the opinion of the witnesses that the object was a foreign aircraft testing some new type of propulsion system. The witnesses were reliable, responsible people and their narrative is considered an honest account of what they observed.

The image appears to contain two sketches or drawings. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the path of an unidentified flying object (UFO) as it moves across the sky. The second sketch shows a larger view of a landscape, with a figure standing on a road, and a smaller inset sketch depicting a skyline view.

OCR output:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" and draw a line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

9. VISUAL OBSERVATIOUS: Source's view of the object was never obstructed during the time of his observation.
10. AIR TRAFFIC: There was no air traffic other than source's observation.

ON 9 AUGUST 53, source was again flying in the vicinity of LA GRANDE. The object he sighted was lenticular in shape and possessed a metallic finish. The source first noticed the object while flying at 14,000 feet en route to Baker, Oregon. The object was first observed at a distance of about 15 miles. The answer he received was that the object had been the subject of unidentified aerial phenomena on previous occasions. This answer did not satisfy the source, however, and he was unable to obtain any further information.

COMMENT OF INTERROGATING OFFICER:
The source's request for information concerning the object he observed is understandable. Unfortunately, the information available for interrogation is so general that it does not enable the interrogating officer to be much more specific in his comments than the answers given to the source during the initial interrogation.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (STATION) NNR 5962 AISS 
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
22 JULY 1953

ON 12 JULY 1953 AT ABOUT 10:15 PM MST, TWO INDIVIDUALS, CIVILIAN OBSERVERS FROM LA GRANDE, OREGON, REPORTED THE OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.
THE OBJECTS WERE FIRST SIGHTED IN THE NORTHEAST SKY, MOVING IN A GENERAL WESTERLY DIRECTION. THEY WERE FLYING AT A RAPID RATE OF SPEED AND APPEARED TO VARY IN THEIR ALTITUDE OR SPEED. THEY WERE OBSERVED FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 15 MINUTES.
THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND EMITTED A BLUE-GREEN LIGHT. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECTS.
IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE OF UNCONVENTIONAL NATURE AND WERE NOT CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, BALLOONS, OR ANY OTHER KNOWN OR EXPLAINABLE PHENOMENA.
THE EXTREME SPEED AND ALTITUDE VARIATIONS OF THE OBJECTS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WITHOUT DOUBT WHAT THEY WERE. THEY COULD HAVE BEEN CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OBSERVED UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT IN VIEW OF THE RELIABLE NATURE OF THE WITNESSES AND THEIR INSISTENCE THAT THE OBJECTS WERE OF UNCONVENTIONAL NATURE, WE ARE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THEIR REPORT AS AN OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

DOWNGRADED AT 3-YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

The text in the document is as follows:

On July 9, 1953, a civil airline pilot sighted an unidentified flying object approximately 3 miles east of LeGrande, Oregon at about 2:04 a.m. He reported this sighting to the LeGrande Airport control tower. The pilot stated that the object was round, brightly lighted, and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. 

The object appeared to be descending when sighted and was observed for approximately 30 seconds. The pilot stated that although the object appeared to be pulsating or oscillating, it did not make any sharp turns or abrupt changes in direction. 

The control tower operator at LeGrande advised the pilot that there were no other aircraft in the vicinity. The pilot's description of the object is consistent with the characteristics previously reported on similar unidentified flying objects. 

This report is forwarded for your information. Dissemination of this information outside Project Blue Book channels will not be permitted. All inquiries will be referred to this office. Access to the file on this incident is restricted and will be made available only to those having a definite need to know.
