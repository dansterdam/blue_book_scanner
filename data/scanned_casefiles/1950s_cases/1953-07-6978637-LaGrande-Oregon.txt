Comments of Preparing Officer

Report contains information concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying
object at a unknown time reported at 20081 July 53, by a Naval aircraft over
La Grande, Oregon, and ground personnel of 762d AC&W Airline at La Grande, Oregon.
Teletype report contains an apparent error in time of reporting sighting. Date time
group 200828 from McBord FS Center converted to local time is 192027 July, which
would be 10 inches after receipt of information from the Seattle ARTC Center. It is
my belief that the date of report, 1 July, should read 19 July.

Observations Record of Sighting:

Observed object color of incandescent lamp, about size of golf ball by naked eye. Came 9 power binoculars and sag triangular object with red round bottom and green top. Located at its time 35 power transit scope and saw initial location like a balloon rising. Bearing toward 270 deg. Like was visible. Relative color was due to reflection of sun on balloon. Distance altitude of about 1,000 feet. Sky clear - wind clear or nearly so - visibility unlimited. Picked up when seen 10 min. had its direction between two telephone wires. Possible slight North course. Several other people there and they came to same conclusion looking up at it. Flew off after a few minutes. To S.E. area. Persons interviewed were Ltr. and Mr. G. R. house to house, and other people who saw the object.

An error it was believe much as Toby Dick type and using 8 power of less binoculars you get something the looks like the report on flying something but when strong enough glasses are used to clear up to much is actually so.

SUMMARY: (Give outline summary of report. Use short concise paragraph. List inclosures at least left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part I(r))

I. SUMMARY:
This report contains information obtained from Lt Cadr [redacted] concerning his visual observation of an unidentified flying object near LA GRANDE, OREGON (Coords: 4JA 5327), at 1730 hours PST, 19 July 53.

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE:
Source is presently employed with the Civil Aeronautics Administration as a Check Pilot. He is also Commander of Reserve Squadron VR 712, Naval Air Station, DENVER Colorado (Coords: FINK 1142). He was on active duty from 12 November 1940 to 5 December 1945, with the following Squadrons: VF-22, VF-101, VF-62 and with the Naval Training Command, VR-2. His total flying time is 5,000 hrs.

Source was very cooperative. He was dressed neatly and was very clean. He was able to estimate distances fairly accurately. He expressed himself fluently and clearly. As a conscientious man and he gave thought to each question before answering. Although source called the Operations CHRI war at Denver Naval Air Station and the statement made by the co-pilot, concerning the unidentified object, read to him before he made a statement, he disagreed with the complete statement on the shape of the object. In his own opinion the interviewing officers that the information supplied by the source was reliable.

o. VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS: Source's view of the object was never obstructed during the time of his observation.

p. AIR TRAFFIC: There was no air traffic other than source's aircraft.

q. On 7 August 53, source was again flying in the vicinity of LA GRANDE, OREGON, and called the 'AM' tower inquiring if the object had been identified. The answer he received was that the object had been identified as a parachute device or some branch of the Federal government. Source was told that the questors did not learn the specific branch of the Federal government referred to.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

The source's co-pilot, [redacted] was not available for interviewing, however, a statement, concerning the object, that he made to Operation of the Denver Naval Air Station on return from the flight was obtained and is included in this report as Enclosure # 4.

1. Source was flying a Navy PD-4 ( Air Force C-47 ) type aircraft in the vicinity of LA GRANDE, OREGON (Source: BEA 5917), on 19 July 53. The LA GRANDE Airport Ground Station made radio contact with source, asked if he could see the object over the town. Source, who was in the co-pilot's position at the time, moved and looked out the left hand side's window. Source is fairly certain that he saw objects and the following is his account of the sighting:

a. ALTITUDE OF SOURCE'S ACFT: 11,000 Feet.

b. GROUND SPEED OF SOURCE'S ACFT: 150 IAS

c. HEADING OF SOURCE'S ACFT: 120 degrees at the time of radio contact by LA GRANDE Ground Station and turned to a heading of 20 degrees for better observation of object.

4. TIME OF SIGHTING: 1930 hours, Pacific Standard Time ( 0330 hours Zulu time).

e. LENGTH OF TIME SOURCE OBSERVED OBJECT: Approximately two (2) minutes.

f. WEATHER AT TIME OF OBSERVATION: CAVU with bright sunlight.

g. DISTANCE OF SOURCE FROM OBJECT: Source estimates that he was never closer than ten (10) miles to the object as he did not attempt to intercept it.

h. POSITION OF HIM AT TIME OF OBSERVATION: To source's left.

i. VISUAL AIDS: Source did not utilize any visual aid.

j. SHAPE OF OBJECT: Triangular or "shield" shape. Source states that the edges were sharply outlined as the object was much brighter than the sky. (See sketch 2A, Incl 1/2).

k. COLOR OF OBJECT: Object steadily appeared to be a bright white-ish or aluminum color.

l. ALTITUDE OF OBJECT: Source estimates 20,000 Feet.

m. SIZE OF OBJECT: Source was hesitant to estimate the size due to the distance of the object from him, a "fairly measured" size of the three (3) sides to be four (4) feet. However, source was very positive that the object appeared to be about the size of a quarter at arm's length. (See sketch 3, Incl 2)

n. MANEUVERS OF OBJECT: Source did not see any erratic, vapor trails or protrusions from the object that would indicate propulsion.

1st Operations Officer
Lowry AFB, Denver, Colo.

Subject: Report on Unidentifiable Flying Object.

On 19 July 1953 at about 1250 PW and while enroute from Walla Walla to Denver in AC 50311 we called by LaGrande, Ore. Radio to make a check on a certain unknown flying object seen from LaGrande. At the time I was flying in the Great Falls, Mont. position as nearly as I can now determine was just southeast of LaGrande, directly on airway 9 and our altitude was 11,300 feet. I was at the top of a cloud mass, a little below thin and high above a I could see a bright gleam which appeared to be the reflection off of some round metallic object. At first it seemed to be not moving but then as I watched the beam having toward us in a lateral direction. As it passed overhead our plane I could see it no longer with my plane captain also reported he could see it for some time in the atmosphere.

It would be very uncertain to estimate its altitude or speed. One thing seemed certain to me, and that was that it was very much higher than we were. The best I could say was that it might have been any altitude above 10,000 feet. It was moreover, to bright to make out any definite outline of the object, but I presumed it was round. Its direction of motion as nearly as I can tell was southerly the terrain perhaps a little to the west.

The extent of our observations makes it impossible to say exactly what the object was. I suspect it was some large silver colored metallic mass, so very high above us, and in the other hand I do not at all discount the possibility that it could have been some strange — perhaps even an extraplanetary vehicle.

NARRATIVE

On July 19, 1953 I was pilot in command of Navy P4Y Aircraft, Bureau No. 90311, en route from NAS Seattle to NAS Denver at approximately 1530. We were approximately 15 miles south of La Grande, Oregon, when at approximately 14,500 feet on a southeasterly heading. The observer, acting as co-pilot, scanned the bright, unidentified object above the left wing.

At the time noted below through the left-hand pilot's window and left was a bright aluminum colored, or possibly white, object that appeared to be approximately over the city of La Grande, Oregon. The object was proceeding in a northerly direction. I observed the object for approximately 2 minutes during which I was in the opinion that it was not a type of weather balloon, although it appeared to have a rounded, triangular shape. I was unable to tell the direction of movement of this object.

While at LaGrande NAS Station will be able to supply this information. It was my estimation that the object was approximately 20,000 feet and, based on this assumption, was of the three sizes estimated to be four feet in length. The object was the only thing in sight with no vapor trails or anything hanging or protruding from the object.

On August 9, 1953 while on another flight from NAS Seattle to NAS Denver, I called the LaGrande, Oregon Station while en route to Lane AFB near and any further information on this object. The communications station operator advised me that the object had been identified as some type of parachute that had been released by some branch of our Federal Government. I remained to him that would account for my belief that the object was triangular in shape. If further information is desired, I am sure that the LaGrande, Oregon Station can assist in this investigation.
