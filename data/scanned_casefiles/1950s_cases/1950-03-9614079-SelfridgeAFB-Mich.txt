from the station in Zone 4 and in as close as 25 miles in Zone 4. Lt. WATSON advised that on Friday, 3 March 1950, at approximately 0305 hours, after no had left a stop party in the Officers' Club having had only a few drinks, he had observed a yellowish light in the sky. WATSON, at this time, was driving his car from the Officers' Club in the direction of the PX on Selfridge Air Force Base. In the direction he was driving, the size and brilliancy unascertained but described to be the approximate color and size of an electric light within a house showing through a normal size window at a distance of close 50 to 75 feet on a clear night. The light was descending vertically over the base and at first appeared to be a flare but, due to the color of the light, it was realized it could not have been a flare. WATSON then stopped his car and observed the light further. The light then proceeded westward holding the same azimuth for approximately 40 to 50 miles. The light then went southward approximately the same distance, stopping and returning northwest from the eastward line of sight the same distance giving the north-south movement approximately 80 to 100 miles. This occurred within four (4) minutes of time.

CONTINENTAL AIR COMMAND
MITCHELL AIR FORCE BASE, NEW YORK

INT 373.5 (2)

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: Director of Intelligence, Headquarters United States Air Force, Washington 25, D.C.

1. Attached for your information are two narrative reports concerning radar sighting of an unidentified flying object.

2. The fact that the object was sighted on the scopes of two (2) radars is considered worthy of special note.

3. Comment of technical experts, this headquarters, was solicited and is quoted in part for your consideration:

a. "While it is relatively well known that various ionospheric conditions cause reflections at lower frequencies, it is usually considered that these layers have no effect at the frequencies used by the two radar sets mentioned except when temperature inversion or other atmospheric or troopospheric conditions cause ducting and spurious reflections. Presuming that such idealized conditions existed at the time of these observations, it is conceivable that an actual small change in physical lateral motion in reference to the radar set could cause a seemingly greater change in relative position of the 'object' as observed on the radar scope due to varying path lengths the radar energy takes to and from the 'object' as a function of the frequency sensitive layers and angles of incidence of the propagated wave. However, the great difference in the frequencies of the two CP-5 and the S-Band CPS-4 radar sets and the evident correlation of observations between these two sets almost rule out the possibility of anomalous propagation effects. Further, the magnitude of the velocity and accelerations of the three dimensional movements of the 'object' reported are beyond the capability of known heavier or lighter than air vehicles in controlled flight.

b. "Also substantiating this unlikelihood, is the fact that the 'object' was reported as remaining stationary in free space for a mean period of two minutes.

c. "Further validity is lent to the contention of the reports by statements that first indications, which were at high altitudes, were

observed on the CPS-4 height-finder before being observed on the CPS-5 surveillance radar set. This follows logic and field experience, inasmuch as the high altitude coverage of the CPS-5 is known to be poor and the antenna is not capable of being automatically tilted a in the case of the CPS-4 on which the controller may tilt the antenna within wide limitations to observe any high altitude or high angle objects. It is to be noted that previous field experience with a CPS-5 surveillance radar set has indicated that targets picked up at ranges and altitudes in the order of magnitude of a B-29 or greater.

d. "In the absence of detailed vertical and horizontal coverage charts for the specific radar sites and comprehensive weather reports for the areas during the period of time these observations were noted, a more complete study or evaluation at this time is not feasible.

e. "In summary, no known electronic phenomena, nor combinations of several electronic phenomena could conceivably produce all of the observations covered by the attached reports."

4. The frequency of reports of this nature has recently increased; instructions have therefore been directed to all radar installations within this command to report scope sightings of unusual objects.

5. It is recommended that reports of unidentified object sightings be reconsidered for submission from all Zones of Interior Air Force agencies.

10 March 1950

NARRATIVE REPORT OF
1ST LT FRANCIS R. PARKER, AC 745 450, 601ST AW & N SQ, SCT STA COMD,
SELFRIDGE AFB, MICHIGAN

On the night of 9 Mar 50, our radar station was in operation monitoring night flying by units of the 56th Fighter-Interceptor Group, Selfridge AFB. I, on duty as approximately an airdown, relieved 1st Lt Watson at the PPI scope (or the A/OPS-5 Radar Site), and established contact with the F-80's already airborne. Lt Watson, 3rd Tac Group, and Col Leith, who made up the rest of our crew for this night, mentioned to me at this time that an aircraft had been picked up intermittently on the PPI scope of the A/OPS-5 height finder radar at 45,000 feet. I knew the highest assigned altitude of the F-80's was 24,000 feet, the target was not at that time visible on either radar scope, so I attributed the report of the high flying aircraft to interference, crew imagination, or both. Over the next fifteen minutes the rest of the crew, mentioned above, repeatedly reported this high flying target at apparently rapidly changing altitudes without my being able to turn around rapidly enough from my monitor of the F-80's in the area to observe for myself. Finally, however, I saw this target which was a very narrow and clear-cut presentation on the PPI scope. It was at approximately 47,000. fast, approximately (70) miles out, and the indication was definitely not that of a cloud or atmospheric phenomena. I checked pilots in the area by VHF and was assured by P-80 pilot at the highest assigned altitude at 24,000 feet. The clarity, narrowness, and definition of the presentation was definitely that of an aircraft. The target gave a similar presentation to that seen by an F-50, and if anything, narrower.

Increasing regularity for the next 45 minutes or an hour, and entries were made of these occurrences in the controller's log by 3d Tac relatively. Invariably, however, the VHF calls on the log, though relatively fair correct, are inaccurate, due to the extreme inaccuracy of 3d Tac's watch. During this period, approximately 1945 to 2030, this target seemed to stay in the area in which our F-80's were flying, sometimes approximating their courses, but 20,000 feet above them. During this same 45 minute period, Lt Watson and other members of the crew reported, both from the PPI scope of the A/OPS-5 and another PPI scope of the A/OPS-5, that

the target hovered in one position and also that it progressed from
a position from as 270°, 78 miles at 46,000 feet to a position at
359°, 53 miles at roughly the same altitude, in 4 minutes. This
would give it a speed towards of 1,500 miles per hour for this run.
I cannot substantiate this, as the data was not very clear, this
run was reportedly intermitten and the times were not to my
knowledge accurately tabulated at actual instances of radar pick-
up during this run. Subsequent individual questioning: I undertook
with members of the crew but the possibility of inaccuracy in
timing during this run. I knew only that the target was very fast.
I observed during this period, by momentarily turning, and with
watching the MI scope, several extra instances of gaining, and
and losing altitude. I was not able at this time to take down the
actual figures, but observed it losing and gaining up to 20,000 feet
very rapidly.

I was able, at 2046 EST, to identify this aircraft on my PPI
scope (AN/CPS-5) and simultaneously on the MI scope. The only
actual timing and altitude was I took from the target I did during
six minutes from 2046 to 2052, during which time this aircraft was
giving indications on both scopes without fade. I took down the
range and azimuth on the units for this period and 5.5 observed
took down the altitudes. (S.k technically times were off aircraft
mentioned but in this case, due to the fact that we were both follow-
ing the same target, I have reconstructed these times into my own,
which were taken in gross pencil already) on the scope head, and
later transcribed.) Information recorded is as follows:

TIME       AZIMUTH   RANGE IN MILES   ALTITUDE IN FEET
2046       156°      45               25,000
2047       151°      49               29,000
2048       146°      56               36,000
2049       142°      80               33,000
2050       135°      87               35,000
2051       138°      73               33,000
2052       138°      79               33,000

These figures, although not as spectacular as some of the climbs
and speeds I had observed, show definitely the erratic speed and
altitude changes. The differences in speed from one minute to the
next were apparent to me as were the climbs and dives. At 2052 the
aircraft faded from the PPI scope and was picked up on two controls
one and two minutes up to 120 miles. It appeared to hover for two
minutes at approximately 110 miles distant. It faded as 120 miles
for the last time. The height-finder carried this aircraft past the

six minute period listed above to a 123°, 37 miles 31,000 feet where it faded for the night from the CPS-4.

The CPS-4 was very accurate on this particular night which was supported by F-30 pilots agreement with many geographical positions given them off the CPS-4. The A/OPS-4, though a more erratic piece of equipment, could not, through any known or apparent means, account for this manner of extreme changes in its operation, account for this manner of extreme changes in altitude. I went over all possible errors which could be induced by A/CPS-4 error exhaustively with my technical personnel.

We are continuing investigation at this station.

I have been a rated pilot since 12 Apr 43, and have been assigned to controller duties for approximately 2 1/2 years.

(Unexplained "Blip" on Radar)
Scopes Caused by Metallic Targets)

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.
ATTN: Combat Intelligence Division

1. SYNOPSIS, 1st Lt. FRANK R. WATSON, AC-626313, Radar Operator
and Controller, 681st AC & W Squadron, Selfridge Air Force Base, Mich.,
and 1st Lt. FRANCIS E. PARKER, AC-741869, same organization, came on duty
on 9 March 1950 observing an unidentified radar "Blip" which acted in a peculiar manner. It was assumed by WATSON and PARKER
that the unidentified "Blip" was of an unconventional type aircraft.
Observations of "Blip" recorded by enlisted personnel on duty during the concerned period of time.

2. DETAILS. Lt WATSON was on duty with the 681st Radar Section
on 9 March 1950 to control the position of local jet aircraft, Observation and control were normal until approximately 1948 hours, at which
time WATSON observed a "Blip" on the WRTH scopes at approximately
10,000' altitude, range and azimuth showing at 270°, 68 miles. "Blip"
was brilliant for a few seconds, then faded, and came back at a different
location approximately five (5) minutes later. At this time other radar
contacts were not well correlated and questioned its. The estimated speed,
which was not well founded but assumed to be about 6500 miles per hour,
is a combination of vertical speed and horizontal speed based on various
vectors derived from the instruments. The "Blip" was observed when
plotted on the second time to rotate locally to a bearing of 350° and
was observed to be consistent for about three (3) minutes with the "WRTH"
scopes. WATSON, during this period of time, did not record the information in a log. However, his curiosity caused him to contact various
different flights in the area to determine their altitude, bearing, and
speed so it could be used as a double check on the radar scopes.
WATSON then left the Radar Room and turned over controller work to

Subject: Unconventional Type Sighted
(Unidentified "Blip" on Radar)
Scopes Caused by Metallic Targets

Lt. PARKER, Lt. PARKER requested that the radar scopes moved in the log various readings and correlated the various scopes. When PARKER's crew first observed the unidentified "Blip", he noticed a very definite rapid decrease in altitude or "nose" score to about 4,500 feet. The "blip" was not normal.

To facilitate understanding of bearings and moves, a 360° circle divided into four (4) equal quadrants, 1st quadrant, i.e., 0 to 90° being Zone 1, 90° to 180° Zone 2, 180° to 270° Zone 3, and 270° to 360° Zone 4, the radar lines being cardinal directions -- north, east, south and west.

Some of the readings from the "TOTH" scope log reveal at 2045 hours, 156°, 45 miles, phantom aircraft; 2047 hours, 157°, 49 miles, phantom aircraft; 2045 hours, 115°, 56 miles, 2049 hours, 125°, 60 miles; 2050 hours, 135°, 79 miles. The readings of "TOTH" scope log reveal at 2105 hours, 135°, 92 miles, 15,000 feet; 2106 hours, 175°, 88 miles, 15,000 feet; 2120 hours, 125°, 207 hours, 135°, 35 miles, 35,000 feet; 2120 hours, 140°, 51 miles, 35,000 feet; 2125 hours, 140°, 56 miles, 35,000 feet; 2115 hours, 140°, 56 miles, 35,000 feet; 2125 hours, 140°, 51 miles, 35,000 feet. The "Blip" was then lost for a period of time, however, at various times throughout the evening, a one (1) to three (3) second observation was made of the unidentified "Blip".

Both PARKER and WATSON are agreed that the approximate size of the unidentified "Blip" would be similar to a 3-D5 and that the initial at times apparently was following a course of various jet fighters in Zones 2 and 3. PARKER and WATSON also believe that the possible vertical readings could be delimited on the part of the "Blip", as it appeared to occur after the radar could initially track it.

After estimated speeds to be from 120 miles an hour horizontal to 3500 miles per hour vertical, they observed more activity to be in the Radar Tracking Room. Each PARKER and WATSON claimed to have his watch position wrong. Both PARKER and WATSON recalculated 15,000 feet altitude within a variation of 68 seconds on the part of the unidentified "Blip". The rapid changes in vertical tracking would occur between 30,000 and 45,000 feet. At one time, Lt. WATSON claimed the unidentified "Blip" to a distance of 90 miles.
