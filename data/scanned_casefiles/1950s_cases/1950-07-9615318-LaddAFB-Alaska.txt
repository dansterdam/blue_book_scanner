REPORT NO. 50-1950
PAGE NO. 1

On 22 July 1950, at 1710 hours (Alaska time) an unidentified object was sighted in the sky over Ladd AFB, Fairbanks, Alaska. The object was sighted by personnel manning AAA gun positions near the Ladd AFB airstrip, 6N 147'W - 147'38"W, and remained in sight for twenty (20) minutes.

Object was viewed laterally from gun positions at an angle of from 50 to 70 degrees and appeared very high.

Object was red in color with two (2) white dots underneath which seemed to revolve around it. It was round in shape, about three (3) feet in diameter and of unknown construction.

Object moved from East to West at an unknown rate of speed. It appeared to be moving in a direct line with no evasive action, and slowly descending.

Any exhaust emitted from the object evaporated very rapidly. The two (2) white dots appeared to be reflectors. There was no visible means of propulsion no audible sound; no apparent air ducts; and no evidence of radio emissions or irregular surface protuberances.

After the object had been almost stationary for approximately twenty (20) minutes, a stream of smoke was noted. Immediately thereafter the object exploded and disappeared from view.

The following persons on active duty with United States Armed Forces at Ladd AFB, Force Base, observed the object:
[Names appear to be redacted]
USA, USA and several unidentified soldiers of a Battery or was 687th AAA, stationed at Ladd Air Force Base. All observers have been considered by the investigating agency to be very reliable.

Weather at the time of observation was CAVU.

There were no known aircraft in the vicinity at the time; and all weather stations contacted in the vicinity reported there were no testing devices sent aloft by their units at the time of sighting.

The following are the Comments appearing at the close of the Alaskan Air Command Intelligence Report 17-50: "Although the sources of information are considered to be reliable, the truth of the incident cannot be evaluated with improbable objectivity. No external interpretation can be offered as to the origin of or nature of the objects mentioned in this report. The possibility exists that the objects were meteorological balloons which might have floated into immediate area from some station in the vicinity of Alaska. The possibility also exists that the object sighted was some kind of terrestrial body."

COMMENT: Alaskan Air Command evaluated the report B-6. Alaskan Air Command original report (Intell) 12-50 was forwarded to the Director of Intelligence, USAF, Washington, D.C. on 13 September 1950.
