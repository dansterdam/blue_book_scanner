Los Alamos, New Mexico
12 December 1952

I. Description of Incident:
An Atomic Energy Commission security employee sighted an unusual phenomenon consisting of an object which appeared to him as a white luminous ball leaving a trail of sparks. The object was in sight approximately 3 seconds, disappearing suddenly. 

II. Discussion of Incident:
The description above closely resembles many others submitted to ATIC which have been evaluated as astronomical phenomena. The short time in sight and the "sparkle" are significant.

III. Conclusion:
Probably meteor.
