SUBJECT: FLYOBSPT

In accordance with ADL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying
Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBSPT), the following report of Unidentified
Flying Object is submitted:

On 30 December 1952, 2002 MST, Security Inspector, Atomic Energy Commission, Los Alamos, New Mexico, observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The observer was made from the sidewalk in front of the headquarters area in the northwest section of the Los Alamos AEC Installation. The object was first observed by the west northwest of the observer, traveling from west to east. Coming of approximately 3200 (E). The object appeared to be about five (5) thousand feet above the terrain (terrain 8,000 ft) above MSL. The object traveled in a constant altitude. The observer stated that the object apparently was followed by a high pitched crackling noise. The sound trailed the object by four (4) seconds. The object appeared as a cone shaped area in color, with no visible control trail. The observer stated the object traveled faster than any jet he had ever seen. No aircraft were known to be in the area at the time of this observation. There was no radar contact with this object. No other observations of this object are known to have been made.
