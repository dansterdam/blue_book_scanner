Here is the text I can discern from the document:

ATIC

(18 JAN 57) 10 34

7/4E4
3 4x12

[Most of the text in the body of the document is too illegible to read clearly. There are several hand-drawn elliptical/oval shapes circled throughout the document. The page is numbered "19" in the top right corner.]


- page 2 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast. I can only make out a few partial words and fragments. In the top right corner, I can clearly see "23° 33' N" and "3-3-57" which appear to be coordinates and a date. The rest of the text is too blurry to accurately transcribe.
