The document contains three faint images that appear to be simple line drawings or traces, likely intended to represent the trajectory or shape of an unidentified flying object (UFO). There isn't sufficient detail to discern any specific features beyond their angular, elongated shapes.

Please note that due to the quality of the image, not all text is legible, and some interpretation had to be made to fill-in missing or unclear characters. The text appears to be a mix of administrative notes, reference numbers, and a brief report or description of a sighting, including a suggestion about the nature of the object sighted.
