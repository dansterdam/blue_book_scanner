SUMMARY: (Enter complete narrative of significant information. Use continuation sheet for additional paragraphs. List inclosures in lower left. Begin last report on AF Form 112-Part I)

1. The following UFOB Report is submitted in narrative form rather than following specified one of AFR 200-2 as the returns of sighting and action taken.

2. On 7 February 1957, between 0955 and 1222, the 686th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Las Cruces Air Force Station, New Mexico, carried a total of 54 unidentified blips on their radar screen traveling from the north toward the station in groups of 60 - 160 knots at altitudes of 6 - 14 angles. Targets disappeared approximately 25 miles from the station. During this time, the 636th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron and 4708th Defense Squadron, had a number of blips, but insufficient evidence to establish their identity. Interceptor squadrons at Kirtland, Albuquerque, Holloman, Tucson, Arizona, and 92d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Kirtland were contacted. No unusual sightings were made; nothing unusual was seen. Ground visual contact was lost almost immediately and a floating radar contact was maintained with 13 targets approximately 100 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas, which was lost in ground clutter.

3. Consultation between 180 Bomber Detachment at 346th Air Division (Defense) and ADC showed that weather conditions in the area of targets was conducive to temperature inversion which could readily cause the type of targets indicated.

4. Visibility in general vicinity of targets was good.

5. The Controller on duty at the time of the incident has stated that his opinion of the targets is that they were caused by temperature inversion.

6. Another possibility exists in that SAC mission of 18 - 21 KC-97, B-47, and B-36 type aircraft has been in the air, and possibly the vicinity, at the time of fighter aircraft arrival. Targets around the 686th (USAF) station could be possible for aircraft to fly over the site, make a turn and fly down the Rio Grande River to El Paso, Texas, without being picked up again after initial fade out.

7. It is the conclusion of this Headquarters that due to number and speed of targets, lack of visual and definite reappearance by interceptor aircraft, Weather conditions, and the possibility of temperature inversion or SAC mission aircraft, the sightings can be explained as a non-hostile radar anomaly.
