AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-D, 4602d AISS | Report No: 3D-UFOB-3-56 | Part Two | Page 5 of 12

I. SOURCE:
Address: [redacted] Watertown, New York
Age: 44
Occupation: Housewife
Education: 16 years
Qualifications: B. A. degree

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a pleasant, well mannered, middle age woman. SOURCE was very definite in her actions and quite opinionated in her answers to investigator's questions. SOURCE definitely possessed intelligence well above the average and was very cooperative. SOURCE watched the object for a short time, then continued to play cards and finally went to observe object again. At no time did SOURCE or the other observers leave the household while observing the object. The investigator believes that SOURCE's statement can only be considered fairly reliable due to her lack of interest in observing the object.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was summoned to observe the object by her son at 11/01/3112 MAR 56. SOURCE described object as being an extremely bright cigar shaped star, but was certain that object was too close to earth to be a star. Although she was not certain of size, SOURCE compared the appearance of object to the size of a small lemon held at arm's length. SOURCE described object as a yellowish white glowing object with a red dot in center and fuzzy or blurred edges. However, as object rotated it became brighter with the red dot turning to a real brilliant red and edges became more sharply outlined.

SOURCE did not remember if there were any stars out or if the moon was visible to her. SOURCE did state that object never went in front or behind anything in the sky. SOURCE described the movement as being circular or rotating. Object appeared first as a flattened circle, and then as a big fat cigar as it rotated. SOURCE viewed object with the naked eye and through high powered French binoculars. At no time did SOURCE leave the household to observe the object, but viewed the object through window glass for entire time of observation. SOURCE viewed object off and on over a period of thirty minutes. SOURCE did not see object disappear as she did not watch it that long.

SOURCE stated that object was first sighted due west and last seen in the same direction. SOURCE described object as being just over the level of the adjoining house. Although SOURCE could not estimate the distance or speed of object, she was certain that it was some type of a flying machine.

SOURCE described the weather as being dry, cold, and clear, but doesn't remember if the wind blowing or not.

Statement of

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

When I first saw the object in the sky it looked like an extremely bright cigar shaped star, but much nearer than a star could be. Within a few minutes the edges became much more clearly defined and at one and a brilliant red section was evident. The object, as it turned toward me, changed shape to more of a circle with the red a smaller round section toward the bottom. As it turned, for a period the outline became more hazy, it seemed to turn around slowly for quite a period of time.

I left before it changed at all in appearance. The color red was just the same type of color as is in the red and green of an airplane, but no much magnified.

Education: Sixteen (16) years
Qualifications: Qualified Engineer

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a well dressed pleasant gentleman and appeared to be younger than his actual age. At first he was not too willing to cooperate with investigator, but after explaining that his name would not be released to the public, he was very cooperative. SOURCE was a highly intelligent man who gave every impression of being well educated. At no time did SOURCE leave the household to observe the object. His interest in the object seemed to be placed on satisfying the curiosity of his son. The COUNCIL's limited interest in sighting of object, it is the investigator's opinion that statements of SOURCE are only fairly reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was summoned by his son at 11/01/312 Mar 56 to observe bright object in the sky.

SOURCE described object as being very bright (that of a carbon arc) with fuzzy edges, solid, and about the size of a fat chubby cigar held at arm's length. SOURCE viewed object through window (plain ordinary eye glasses). SOURCE made entire observation from within the household.

SOURCE sighted object in the southwest and last saw object in the same direction. SOURCE stated that object appeared to be close to the horizon as it was visible just over the tops of other houses in the area.

According to SOURCE there was no stars or moonlight visible to observer. SOURCE further stated that object did not move in front of or behind anything in the sky. SOURCE stated the possibly or object being a reflection of light rays from a ceiling light or something similar. SOURCE could not estimate the speed of object and heard no sound from object. SOURCE was not observing object when it disappeared.

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

Son called attention to bright "star" in sky. Curiosity brought family to window. Movement caused us to consider it other than a star. Object appeared to be longer up and down than it was wide. Appeared to me as a bright light with an aura of lesser light. After the first few moments, object seemed to move to the left again (NW) and the lower end seemed to appear red. This red area varied in size as the object moved. I personally did not see the object disappear or fade away.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with 655th AC&W Squadron at Watertown, New York, revealed that SOURCE's report was the only one received pertaining to the sighting of this object. Also, 655th AC&W Squadron indicated that radar results of object were negative. Identification and interception action taken by 655th AC&W Squadron was also negative. No aircraft were in the area at time of sighting, according to 655th.

2. The information received from the U. S. A. F. Weather Office at Syracuse A. F. Station, Syracuse, New York (GJPP 5204) indicated wind velocity in degrees and knots as follows:
Surface -     250° - 5                20,000 - 270° - 60
              250° - 15               30,000 - 270-100
6,000 -       260 - 25                50,000 - 270 - 20
10,000        (The above constituted the winds at approximately 11/0130Z Mar 56)
At 11/0130Z Mar 56 the ceiling was 20,000 feet, clouds broken; visibility fifteen miles plus.

3. A check with Howard A. Scott, CAA Routing and Control Station at Watertown Airport (GJPP 5858) indicated that no unusual phenomena were observed in the area at the time of sighting. Mr. Scott further stated that he was using the ceiling at 20,000 feet just prior to sighting time, but did not believe that its reflection would give a facsimile of mentioned object with the ceiling at 20,000 feet. Mr. Scott also stated that small helium balloons were displayed from that station twice an hour, but their size is relatively small and these balloons were not illuminated.

4. A check was made with Dr. Fredrickson of Syracuse University Observatory, Syracuse, New York. Dr. Fredrickson stated that Venus is always seen in the western sky, normally no higher than 45° from the horizon. Venus sets between 0300 and 0400Z at this time of year. Just prior to setting, Venus appears to become reddish, similar to the color of the sun, when it sets. Venus is the brightest object in the sky (excluding the moon and sun) and is often seen by layman as unusual phenomenon, due to its brilliancy and apparent largeness.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. Preparing Officer concludes that this sighting was probably caused by the planet Venus for the following reasons:

a. All observers sighted object in the western sky, no higher than 5° from horizon, which coincides with the appearance of Venus. Venus always appears in the west at this time of year, not far from the horizon, and sets in the same direction early in the evening. (See Part Four, Par. 4)

b. All observers viewed object through window glass and did not go outside to see if a better view could be obtained. Although all observers considered the object very brilliant and closer than a star, the only left that handmade to verify its true size and character above it.

c. Each observer was either vague or contradicted the other in their answer to the size that the object appeared to them.

d. Radar painting of object were negative as attempted by the 655th ACGW Squadron, Watertown, New York. (See Part Four, Par. 1)

5. A check with CAA Routing and Control Station at Watertown Airport, revealed that no unusual phenomena were observed in the area at the time of sighting.

f. Weather was described as clear, 20,000 feet ceiling, clouds broken; with visibility of fifteen miles. (See Part Four, Par. 2)

g. Time of observation as stated by SOURCES, ranged from ten minutes to thirty minutes. All observers were certain of their respective answers.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
It is the opinion of this headquarters that items 1a through 1g, above, and the description of the object definitely indicate that this sighting was a misinterpretation of the planet Venus.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. Preparing Officer concludes that this sighting was probably caused by the planet Venus for the following reasons:

a. All observers sighted object in the western sky, no higher than 50° from horizon, which coincides with the appearance of Venus. Venus always appears in the west at this time of year, not far from the horizon, and sets in the same direction after a few hours. (See Part Four, par. 4)

b. All observers viewed object through window glass and did not go outside to see if a better view of object would help to identify it. Although, all observers considered the object brilliant and clear than would be normally left, no one seemed alarmed about it.

c. Each observer was either vague or contradicted the other in their answer to the size that the object appeared to them.

d. Radar paintings of object were negative as attempted by the 655th ACGM Squadron, Watertown, New York. (See Part Four, par. 1)

e. A check with CAA Routing and Control Station at Watertown Airport, revealed that no unusual phenomena were observed in the area at the time of sighting. (See Part Four, par. 3)

f. Weather was described as clear, 20,000 feet ceiling, clouds broken, with visibility of fifteen miles plus. (See Part Four, par. 2)

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a typical young american boy in his manner and actions. However, SOURCE was to some extent interested in certain aspects of sciences than the average boy of his age. Likewise, SOURCE was well spoken in this field.

At no apparent time did SOURCE take any other observable excited concern about the sightings of object. At no time did SOURCE leave the household to observe object. Therefore, it is the investigator's opinion, that statements of SOURCE be considered as only fairly reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE noticed the object when entering a dark room at 11/0130Z on 16 Mar 56 at Watertown, New York at home of his grandmother, Mrs. [redacted]. Object was shining brightly in the sky with no stars around it. SOURCE noted a slight movement of the object and summoned other observers (See Parts Two and Three) to scrutinize the object.

During twelve (12) minutes of sighting, SOURCE stated there was no trace of daylight, many stars to be seen, and no moonlight. SOURCE described object as brighter than sky, solid, and appearing similar to a fluorescent light. According to SOURCE, object changed from small to large and vice versa; at times becoming very brilliant and then fading somewhat. SOURCE stated that at no time did object move in front or behind anything in the sky, nor did it emit any sound.

SOURCE observed object through window glass with the aid of high powered French Binoculars. While observing through binoculars, SOURCE stated that object had a definite outline of a triangle with a red spot in the center. SOURCE stated that object appeared to be round with gray or blurred edges to the naked eye.

SOURCE was certain that object appeared as a pea held at arm's length. SOURCE further stated that object was beyond or atmosphere and moving slowly.

SOURCE sighted object due west and last observed object in the west. Object disappeared while SOURCE was notifying 655th ACGW Squadron. SOURCE stated that object was approximately forty-five (45) degrees from the horizon when first sighted and thirty (30) degrees from horizon when he last observed it.

SOURCE described weather as being dry, cold, and a clear sky with slight breeze.

As I went out into the kitchen for a drink of water, I noticed a bright light in the sky with no stars around it. As I watched it, it appeared to move slightly, so I called my mother, who saw it, and also said it was slightly, my father, grandmother, and great uncle came out, also saw it and also said it was moving, slightly, when I looked through binoculars, it appeared to be triangular shape. When I left to report it the second time, it evidently disappeared.

It was triangular in shape, glowing, with the color of light that a fluorescent light.
