AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FLIGHT 3-8, GOOD AREA  
30-UFD3-56                     PART 5

Address: Watertown, New York  
Age: 44  
Occupation: Housewife  
Education: 16 years  
Qualifications: B.A. degree  

II. RELIABILITY: The witness was a pleasant, middle age woman, source was very definite in her actions and quite opinionated in her answers to investigator's questions. The information provided appeared reasonable, and agreed with accounts had previously from observers identified. On one occasion the witness reported to play cards and usually went to observe objects again. At no time did she demonstrate any reluctance to discuss this incident.

III. INVESTIGATION OF SIGHTING: The witness was at home at 11/2/56 and decided to observe the object mentioned in local reports. By her own account she observed the object for 30 to 45 minutes. The object gave off a brilliant red glow that flashed and faded periodically, much more sharply outlined.

SOLUTION: Sighting was reported as unidentifiable, no attempt to rationalize. If the moon was visible at the time, it could have been a trick of the eye, showing the movement as being circular or pulsating. Otherwise, no explanation is made.

The witness did not leave the household to observe the object. At no time did it appear to change position or speed of travel. The object remained stationary in the sky and after about 15 minutes, the witness reported it suddenly disappeared as she did not watch it that long.

The witness's description agreed with other observers on the level of the sighting. Although source could not estimate the distance or speed of the object, the sighting was consistent with other reports.

The sources described the weather as being dry, cold, and clear, but doesn't remember if the wind was blowing or not.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-D, 46024 ATSS
From: 2nd Lt. Part Teo, Report # 30-UTOB-3-56
Report: When I first saw the object in the sky it appeared to be an extremely bright star-shaped object, but much larger than an average star. As it approached me, it became more defined and at one end a brilliant red section was evident. This section seemed to be emitting a stream of small white particles, giving the appearance of a single vortex. The object disappeared and the outline became very faint. It seemed to turn around. I left before it changed at all in appearance. The color was just the natural color which is different, but so much brighter. It stayed in one position in the sky throughout.

I. SOURCE:
Address: Watertown, New York
Age: Fifty-four (54)
Occupation: Production Engineer
Education: College (4) years
Qualifications: Qualified Engineer
III. RELIABILITY:
SOURCES was a well-dressed, pleasant gentleman and appears reliable. SOURCE has had some experience with objects of this type and was interested in reporting his observation to the authorities. SOURCE was highly intelligent and it was believed that he made a sincere effort to give an accurate report of his observation.

VII. THIS SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
SOURCE was summoned by his son at approximately 6:00 p.m. on the evening of the sighting. SOURCE described the object as being very bright (like of a carbon arc) with fuzz or sparking running around the outer edge. SOURCE stated that the object maintained a steady course and speed and disappeared from sight in the direction it was traveling.
SOURCES made entire observation from within the household.

VIII. CONCLUSION AS PER LAST PAGE:
SOURCE stated that the object appeared to be close to the horizon as it was leaving the area. 

According to SOURCE there was no stars or moonlight visible to observe in the sky and the object was "an unnatural light" SOURCE could not identify the object.  SOURCE was not able to determine the size, altitude or speed of the object.

INITIAL PART THREE: Report #D-40-608-4-56
STATEMENT ON SIGHTING: Curiosity brought us to consider it other than a star-like object a, phenomenon caused us to do this. The object appeared to move in a zig-zag motion, then it would stop, then move to the left again (SW) and the lower and seemed to move in a vertical plane at this point. I personally did not see any lights on the object as it appeared black in color. After moving as described for some time the object seemed to move to the left again (SW) and disappeared from view. I personally feel the object was not a star-like object or an aircraft but some type of unidentified flying object.

FLIGHT 3-D-4, 46093 AISU

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:
1. An interview with Captain Olin S. Cooper, Operations Officer of the 59th ACAW Squadron at Watertown, New York, revealed that on 3-29-56 at 2030 hours, members of this squadron were alerted and tracked radar contacts in the area. These radar contacts were intermittent and unidentified.
2. Also, a 29th ACAW squadron indicated that radar results of object were negative. The unidentified objects were tracked from Lowville to Watertown and back to Lowville again. The sightings were considered to be negative.
3. The information received from the U.S.A.F. weather office at Syracuse reported GOPA 2350-5 indicated visually in degrees and knots as follows:
20,000 - 265 - 5
15,000 - 270 - 15
10,000 - 260 - 15
4. At 11/01/102 hours the wind speed constituting the reported objects speed were 50,000 to 270 mph (visibility down to 11/01/102 mar 50).
5. A check with Howard A. Scott, CAA Routing and Control Station at Watertown Airport (CJPC 5483) indicated that no unusual phenomena were observed in the area on the evening of 3-29-56.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. Preparing Officer concludes that this sighting was probably caused by the nature/location of the following reasons:

a. All observers sighted object in the western sky, no higher than 20 degrees above horizon, and for a duration of approximately 30 minutes. The object was observed to change direction early in the evening. (See Part Four, par. 4)

b. All observers viewed object through glass and did not go outside to see it a better view of object would help to identify it.

c. Three observers stated that object would be appear and disappear at times. If it was a balloon type object, the clouds and wind would account for this type of motion.

d. Each observer was either vague or contradicted the other in their observation as to details such as color, size etc.

e. Radar paintings of object were negative as attempted by the 662nd AC&W Squadron. (See Part Five, par. 1)

f. A check with CAA Routing and Control Station at Watertown Airport revealed no other unusual phenomena were observed at the time of sighting. (See Part Four, par. 3)

g. Weather conditions as described [weather text obscured] 20,000 foot ceiling, clouds broken, with visibility of fifteen miles plus. (See Part Three)

h. Time of observation as stated byOURCES, ranged from ten minutes to thirty minutes. All observers were certain of their observations.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
It is the opinion of this Headquarters that items 1 through 10 above, and the descriptions of the object definitely indicate that this sighting was a misinterpretation of the planet Venus.

CONTROL SYMBOL 30-UFOM-3-50 PAGE TWO
SUBJECT: 3-30, 4603d AISS
CONTENTS OF Preparing Officer:
a. This Preparing Officer concludes that this sighting was probably caused by the 
planet Venus. All observers stated that it was visible in the western sky and seemed 
to be stationary. From reports, it appears that Venus was quite low on the horizon 
and must have seemed very bright and steady at that time of the evening. Venus is 
sometimes mistaken for a UFO object, due to its brillance and steady position in the 
sky.
b. All observatory personnel observed this object, through glass, and did not 
see it as a blinking or rapidly moving object. Although the object appeared brighter 
and closer than a star would be, nobody lost sight or control of the object. Under 
these conditions, it seems to fit the description of the planet Venus.
c. Each observer was either vague or contradicted the other in their statements. 
No evidence to the contrary that the object was Venus was presented.
d. Radar paintings of the object were negative as attempted by the 623rd ACAW 
Squadron.
e. A check with CIW Routing and Control Station at Watertown Airport 
revealed that no unusual phenomena were observed on their scope at the time of sighting.
The weather was described as clear, 20,000 feet ceiling, clouds broken. Time of 
observation as stated by SOURCES, ranged from ten minutes to thirty minutes. 
All observers were certain of their statements.

2ND LT USAF
Asst. Officer in Charge

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:
It is the opinion of this headquarters that items in the above, 2nd 
Indorsement, conclude that this sighting was most likely the planet Venus. No 
further action on this incident appears necessary.

March 7, 1956 Part One, Report # 30-UFO-3-56
Statement of Mr. [REDACTED]

As I went out into the kitchen for a drink of water, I noticed a bright light in the sky which no stars normally appear. It appeared to be an oval object suspended in the air, which was a bright light, bright enough to illuminate the surrounding area and make it light as day. It was very close and very large, estimated to be 80 to 100 feet in diameter. The light was the only light visible and it remained stationary for about 10 to 15 minutes, then it suddenly flashed out leaving no trace. It was just gone. 

It did not appear to have any form or shape, the light was just a round, bright light, glowing, with the color and brilliance of a fluorescent light.
