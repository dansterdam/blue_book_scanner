Dear Sanford:

I never thought it would be said that I would join the great army of flying saucer seers. However, note the attached report. I know that you have some sort of a section that is considering these reports; therefore I send this to you so that you may pass it along to them.

The duration, distinctness, and the complete unexpectedness of my sitting here and not having details of any report. Never more will I be skeptical of anybody's fanciful tales. Please don't think that the desert has got the best of me.

Best personal regards,

Sincerely,
[Signature of Brigadier General, USAF is blacked out]

APO 96, c/o POSTMASTER
NEW YORK, NEW YORK

SUBJECT: Report Upon Sighting of "So-Called" Flying Saucer

TO: Director of Intelligence
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Place: Dhahran, Saudi Arabia
Date: 19 April 1952
Time: 2120 local daylight savings (1620 Z)

Weather Conditions: Flight, cloudless skies, maximum visibility,
no moon but starlit.

1. While reclining alone on my patio for an after-dinner smoke, I noticed in the far distance in the general south-southwest area of the sky what, at first glance, I thought was the tail, end or "shooting star" which are commonly seen in this area of the world. My next instant realization was that this object, in the sky was not falling toward earth but was travelling horizontal to the ground at a constant altitude and on a constant course. My next mental reaction was that it was an aircraft. Apparently the Air was. This was instantly dispelled by the high rate of closure of the object coming almost directly toward me and by the fact that although conditions surrounding me at the time were extremely quiet, I heard absolutely no sound from this flying object. The speed was so great that I knew it could not be an airplane of any type. At this point, knowing the tricky illusions one gets in looking into a starlit sky, I looked carefully away from the object and back. Again my eyes immediately picked it up, although it was considerably further along on its course. By this time I was positively convinced that it was some unusual phenomenon. I continued to follow the object, which at this point had apparently disappeared into a generally north-northwesterly direction beyond the scope of normal vision. It was necessary for me to turn almost a complete 180 degrees in order to follow it. I lost sight of it. I would judge as a fairly accurate estimate that the object was visible to me for a period of from 5 to 6 seconds. I would judge its speed as considerably in excess of any jet aircraft I have seen in flight. If I were forced to estimate the speed it would be in the neighborhood of a thousand to twelve hundred miles an hour.

Hq, 1414th Air Base Gp, MATS, Subj: Report Upon Sighting of "So-C-13a"
Flying Saucer, 21 April 1952

2. The appearance of the object at first was a dull glow without sharply defined dimensions more of the nature of a transport aircraft single lighted window at a fair distance during night flight. The intensity was about that of a low wattage electric light bulb when the current is weak. As the object approached nearer my line of sight it distinctly broke into two parts on absolutely the same altitude and without wavering or fluctuations relatively two each other, allowing my imagination to form the impression that the glow was at the extreme sides or time of some unseen body between—almost the same impression one would resolve seeing navigation lights on an aircraft's wing tips at night. This was further borne out as the object travelled across the sky by the relative position of those two glows changing as the angle of sight changed in the same manner as would navigation lights on an aircraft as the aircraft travelled along. As the object progressed into the distance and I had a stern chase view, the two glows distinctly separated again verifying and emphasizing the impression described above. The altitude during the entire viewing, I would describe as a medium altitude above 10,000 feet and below 30,000 feet although this particular impression is the one of which I am least positive. If I would assume that this was some sort of an aircraft, it is to me, glows at the extremities thereof I would say that it was an aircraft of considerable size, but I must add that I saw nothing, beyond the two glows which would indicate a vehicle of any kind.

3. Being thoroughly familiar with aircraft, weather balloons and other aeronautical objects during my entire career, I am positive that it was none of these things.
