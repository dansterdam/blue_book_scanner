SUMMARY: (State character summary of report, date, significance of past occurrences, progress, list references at lower left. Begin text of report at AF Form 112-Part 1(A)

In reference to FLYCRYPT teletype reporting the observation of an unidentified flying object by Mr. _______, investigation has established that such objects can be explained.

From the information furnished by the observer, it appears that the object seen on 12 September was, in reality, a blimp and the object seen on the succeeding night was either an extremely bright star or a planet. These explanations are, of course, not 100% conclusive; however, at this time they appear to suffice.

SUMMARY: (Enter control number of report, date significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List incidents in lower left. Despatch as AF Form 112-Part (2)).

Civilians reported again an unidentified flying object while on duty at 0755
on 14 September 1952.

Officer called York to verify it. While both men were watching, he heard a boat
on the Susquehanna River. They noticed a round bright light in the sky south-
east of their position. At approximately 1830 hours. The light
was stationary when first observed and was a "brilliant light blue" color.
It began to move horizontally, "hesitated", moved again horizontally in a
southeasterly direction and then appeared to move toward the
river. The object disappeared behind a tree and the observers could not de-
termine whether the object disappeared into the river or behind the hills
beyond the river. Both men said this did not resemble a meteor in either
behavior or appearance.

The observers stated that as soon as the object began moving the sound
stopped. They also reported that while the object was moving it appeared to
be brighter than when first sighted in a stationary position. No trail or
exhaust was noted.

The length of the observation was timed at three minutes.

Both observers maintained that the sound came from the direction of the
light. Officer Burkett reported that he had heard the same sound briefly at
04302, but that he did not notice anything unusual at that time.

Weather at the time was clear with two to three miles visibility. Winds
were: surface 220/5k, 2000' 320/5k, 4000' 350/11k, 6000' 330/17k.

It is possible that the guards were observing a light disrepant, but the
absence of navigation lights would seem to discount it. If, perchance, it
was the landing light of an aircraft, a beam should have been visible. The
visibility would seem to confirm the observers' statements, but only a
dull, very faint, quite a bright light. This entire case is of doubtful
significance.
