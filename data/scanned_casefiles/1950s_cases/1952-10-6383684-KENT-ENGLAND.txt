October 9, 1952

Commanding General
United States Air Force
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

I embarked on the Cunard Liner Caronia at Southampton, England, on September 30, 1952.

On October 5, 1952, at 5:12 p.m., time of the local longitude, I was standing on the starboard side of the ship by the swimming pool on the deck which is immediately above the promenade deck. This deck is perhaps twelve feet above the promenade deck, and there is an offset in the ship at that point so that it was perhaps fifteen feet inboard from the starboard side of the ship. While standing there with my wife, I noticed a group of people below me, also on the starboard side and perhaps forty feet away, standing immediately under the starboard wing of the after-bridge of the ship and staring off at some object in the air on the starboard side. One of the individuals had a pair of glasses. I was curious to know what they were looking at, so I began to look in the sky.

Commanding General
United States Air Force                -2-                October 9, 1952

I saw a very brilliant bright object, a perfect circle in shape, which I had the impression was flat, with the flat surface in a vertical plane and presented directly towards me.

The object bore between one and two points on the starboard bow of the ship and at an angle above the surface of the water which I should estimate to be between 15° and 20° of arc from the horizontal. The object had a brilliant light, almost of the intensity of a welding torch. I should say that it was much brighter than a star could possibly be and was somewhat less bright than the sun. The light emanating from it was a strong silver color. This incident took place at 5:12 p.m., and as soon as I first saw the object and had gotten over the momentary reaction from doing so, I timed it. I asked my wife to go down to the main deck, two decks below, and bring back a pair of powerful field glasses which I had. In the meantime, I walked down from the swimming pool and joined the group under the after-bridge. This group consisted of a man whose identity I do not know, his wife, a member of the Cabin Class orchestra (the man who played the bass viol, whose name I also do not know) and one or two other persons, one of them a woman. During this entire period of time while I was watching the object, there was a pink cloud much closer to the vessel than the object appeared to be and practically at the same angle from the ship and the surface of the ocean. I would estimate the position of this small cloud to be perhaps five miles from the vessel, and the object at all times appeared to be beyond this cloud. I have the impression, although

I cannot be sure of this, that the object moved in its position
both horizontally and vertically with relation to this cloud.
I do not know whether it moved further from or nearer to the
vessel or whether the diameter of the luminous portion of the
disk varied; i.e., whether it contracted and expanded. At any
rate, after I had the object under observation for a period of
1 minute and 45 seconds, it disappeared by a gradual fading.
During the process of this fading, the diameter did not change.
In other words, I had the impression that the light simply shut
off, rather than that the object disappeared by moving elsewhere.

During the course of this incident, the sun bore on the
port side of the vessel, perhaps one point off the port bow, and
was perhaps 20° from the horizontal. At this time, the sun and
the surrounding sky was a pale pink color as contrasted to the
brilliant silver color of the object. However, the sun was
obscured from my sight at all times while I was standing by the
swimming pool by the super-structure of the deck above and
further forward.

Subsequently, I wrote a letter to the Staff Captain
of the ship requesting the position of the vessel as of the
moment when I first saw the object. I have a letter from the
Staff Captain indicating that the ship's position at that time
was 42°19' N., 55°07' W. and that the vessel was on a course
of 260°30'. I do not know whether any of the officers of the
ship or the watch saw this object, but I am inclined to think
that they must have. My wife was standing beside me except

while getting the glasses, and she also observed this phenomenon.

I am writing this letter solely for the purpose of adding to the available store of information with respect to these objects, as I thought the position of its appearance at sea might well have scientific interest for the sub-division of your command studying these objects.

When this letter reaches the proper office, I should appreciate a reply.

Very truly yours,
