Text transcription:

Ref.: Case: 24 Nov, 1955
Hokkaido, Japan:

The sighting was reported as a real slow moving object which was first observed at 19:13 hrs and last seen at 19:52 hrs on November 24, 1955. The object had been in sight for about 39 minutes.

The object was cylindrical in shape and had a trail behind it. (Sketchy) 39Â°.

To the estimated direction of the cylinder, there was slight indication of glow or luminosity at that point. The color was not given.

For this, (case) there was no photograph taken, which is regrettable, 23 32'N and 142 42'E.

Conclusion: The report shows that the object was seen over a considerable period of time, and it was not identified as a known astronomical or aircraft phenomenon.

Text from the document:

The case and the background information it contains is basically within acceptable limits of believable events. This case was reported by personnel of the Military Police of the U.S. Army at Hokkaido, Japan, and occurred at about 2:10 A.M. on 7 November 1955.

The report contains nothing sensational and seems quite matter-of-fact. the object was seen for approximately 1-1/2 minutes and disappeared over the horizon. More complete details would be required for a full evaluation, but the sighting appears to be of an unidentified flying object of some nature. There is no indication of advanced or unusual performance characteristics, and the sighting does not appear to be exceptional in comparison with many others.

The principal observer who made the report is a responsible NCO with the Military Police unit concerned, and his report appears straightforward and objective. The case is worth including in the file as a typical sighting report, but does not seem to contain evidence of any extraordinary nature at this time.

The following is a summary of the case:

INFO: AFOIN-241
Reference your message 42775 dtd 011922 Dec concerning UFOB sighting by F-86 pilot over Hokkaido, Japan. Preliminary evaluation by ATIC as follows: Probable reflection of moon through cloud layer.
Moon at that time of year was in first quarter and set sometime around midnight. The reflection of sunlight from the moon through a cloud layer would result in the cloud filtering the blue from the reflection and thus leaving a reddish-orange glow. The moon would not be visible to the observer due to its low position on the horizon and its obstruction from view by existing cloud layers.

AND WAS SOON WITH THE AID OF HIS RAY - THERE WERE NO CLOUD CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND ABOVE NEVER FOG MENTIONED CARE WAS TAKEN TO CLIMB AND THE VISIBILITY WAS EXCELLENT GOOD. THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED CAN BE LOCATED ON SOME OF SOME CHM ALTITUDE AT APPROXIMATELY 35,000 FEET AND ON HEADING OF APPROXIMATELY 290 DEGREES. IT APPEARED TO BE A CIRCULAR OR SPHERICAL OBJECT OF A SIZE THAT IN AN EARLY STAGE OF THE OBSERVATION THOUGHT THAT POSSIBILITY BY PUTTING MY HAND IN ORDER TO OBSCURE IT THAT THIS TWO SPECTRA CIRCLES WERE OBTAINED WITH THE HAND: I NEXT THOUGHT THAT THE GLOW MAY BE COMING FROM SOME SORT OF AN AIRCRAFT ON FIRE BUT THIS WAS ELIMINATED BY HAVING OBSERVATION OF THE AIRCRAFT CLOSE BY: THIS POSSIBILITY WAS ELIMINATED BY TURNING INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT AND A HEADING OF SIX DEGREES WAS ESTABLISHED TO PLACE THE LIGHT DIRECTLY OUT IN FRONT OF ME. A FEW MINUTES HAD ELAPSED AND A SHARP TURN TO THE LEFT WAS EXECUTED; FOLLOWING THIS THERE WAS A REMARKABLE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT WITHIN TWO MINUTES, HAVING TRAVELED A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO MINUTES HAD ELAPSED SHORTLY AFTER THE TURN.

FAST CRM I.E. IN LESS THAN THIRTY SECONDS, MY LOCATION WAS WD 8585 AND THE ALTITUDE WAS APPROXIMATELY 35,000 FEET. DIMENSIONS OF MY OBSERVATION WERE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO APPRXIMIATE THE SIZE OF THE GLOW CRM SHOULD BEAR COLOR WAS EXCENTRIC WHILE BEING OF APPROXIMATE TWENTY MILES THIS WOULD MAKE THE DIAMETER OF THE SPHERE TO BE APPROXIMATELY THREE STATUTE MILES. THIS WOULD EXCEED EVEN THE LARGEST KNOWN DIAMETER OF THE GLOW THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE OBSERVATION THE CRM WAS A DEEP RED WITH AN ORANGE TINT. IT APPEARED THAT THE BRIGHTEST AND LONGEST DURATION OF THE LIGHT REACHED JUST PRIOR TO THE SHARP TURN. AN ELONGATED DARK OBJECT APPEARED HORIZONTALLY TO THE LEFT AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPHERE. THIS CLOSELY RESEMBLED A CLOUD FORMATION AND BLOCKED OUT APPROXIMATELY ONE-FIFTH OF THE SPHERE. I WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE IN ANY WAY WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF THIS INFORMATION COULD BE. AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT THE MOON WAS AT 151 DEGREES ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH - SINCE THIS WAS A SIGHTING OF SUCH STRANGE AND UNUSUAL PHENOMENA THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL RECORD OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS IN THIS AREA. UNQUOTE REQUEST ABOVE - EVALUATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

JOINT MESSAGEFORM

AS INDICATED BELOW
FROM: (Originator) SPACE ABOVE FOR COMMUNICATIONS CENTER ONLY
CMDR ATIC
TO: D/I HQ USAF WASHINGTON 25 D C
INFO: AFOIW-4
Reference your messages 53032 dtd 071826Z Dec and 52776 dtd 011902Z Dec. Although the time element and description of the glow could coincide with a nuclear explosion, it is unlikely that this cause initiated the report for the following reasons:
a. Negative historical report from Far East sources maintaining 
	dissonance viii1.
b. No previous explosions reported from that particular location of
the glow.
Reference our message IC 41208 dtd 021132Z Dec. Evaluation contained therein 
remains the same. However, one discrepancy remains to be clarified. In your 
message 53032, the following statement appears: "REAP comment, at the time of
incident, the moon was at 191 degrees from the position of the aircraft." Should
this azimuth location read 291 degrees? A position of 191 degrees would locate 
the moon in a SSE direction at time of setting. A position of 291 degrees would
establish the correct approximate 1055 14-18 july 1955 1507.
