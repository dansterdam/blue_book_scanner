Ref: Case: 24 Nov. 1955
Hokkaido, Japan

The sighting of a red glow
was reported as of 16:13 2
at long. 140°E. and 52°N, on
Nov. 24, 1955. Close reported 65
have been low on horizon at
azimuth (bearing) 312°.

To ... of interest to complete
the azimuth of the gibran
moon at that instant (16:13 2)
at Hokka...

For this purpose we note that
at that time the sight ascension
of moon was approx. 23° 32'
and its declination, approx. + 2° 42'.

Computation shows that the
local sidereal time at 16° 13' was 20° 24'.

and at Hokkaido it was therefore
5° 48'ne. The hour angle of the
moon (t) was therefore 6° 16'ne.

To obtain the azimuth of
the moon, we employ:

tan Z = cos P tan S - sin P cos t
where Z = azimuth, (from theory)
t = hour angle of moon
P = latitude
i = declination of moon

At this, the proper care
was to the horizon was found that,
tan Z = 1.180 (approx)
Z = 49 1/2° W.

The azimuth A is = therefore
360 - 49 1/2° = 310 1/2°

JOINT MESSAGEFORM

FROM: COMDR ATIC 6X

TO: D/I HQ USAF WASHINGTON 25 D C

INFO: FROM: AFOIN-4EL FOR: AFOIN-2A1

Reference your message 54776 dtd 011902Z Dec concerning UFOB sighting by F-86 pilot over Hokkaido, Japan. Preliminary evaluation by ATIC as follows: Probable reflection of moon through cloud layer.

Moon at that time of year was in first quarter and set sometime around midnight.

The reflection of sunlight from the moon through a cloud layer would result in the cloud filtering the blue from the reflection and thus leaving a reddish-orange glow.

The moon would not be visible to the observer due to its low position on the horizon and its obstruction from view by existing cloud layers.

THOUGHT THAT THE GLOW MIGHT BE COMING FROM THE AFTERBURNER OF ANOTHER

INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE GLOW. THE GLOW REMAINED STATIONARY AND A
HEADING OF 312 DEGREES WAS ESTABLISHED TO PLACE THE LIGHT DIRECTLY
AHEAD OF THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE MISSION WAS STILL IN PROGRESS I TURNED

THE ENTIRE TIME WAS A DEEP RED WITH AN ORANGE TINT. IT APPEARED THAT
THE HIGHEST INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT WAS REACHED JUST PRIOR TO THE

JOINT MESSAGEFORM

FROM: CBMDR ATIC

INFO: 41242
FROM: APOIN-484 FOR: APOIN-2A1

Reference your messages 53032 dtd 071826Z Dec and 52776 dtd 011902Z Dec. Although the time element and description of the glow could coincide with a nuclear explosion, it is unlikely that this cause initiated the report for the following reasons:

a. Negative historical report from Far East sources maintaining seismog & MPN clearance will.

b. No previous explosions reported from that particular location of the glow.

Reference our message IC 41208 dtd 021130Z Dec. Evaluation contained therein remains the same. However, one discrepancy remains to be clarified. In your message 53032, the following statement appears: "FEAF comment, at the time of incident, the moon was at 191 degrees from the position of the aircraft." Should this azimuth location read 291 degrees? A position of 191 degrees would locate the moon in a SSE direction at time of setting. A position of 291 degrees would establish the correct approximate location to the West at setting.
