10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Nine (9) objects in five (5) separate formations were sighted from Pacific Beach, Calif. by a party of nine military and civilian persons. Each object seemed oval in shape and slightly blush in color. These were no ground or tail. The objects were in a 2-1-2-1 formation. The "J" object formation was "V" shaped. The objects were at height unknown, but seemed too fast for aircraft.

11. COMMENTS
A telephone check with one member of the party concerned with this sighting only verified the initial report and did not bring to light further information. Also, a check with a local observatory and naval air stations resulted in no indication of any type astronomical or meteorological activity which might account for this sighting. Although there were jet aircraft in the air at the time, a positive identification cannot be positive.
