The image contains two sketches or diagrams, but no photograph. The text describes an observation of a "round ball, very bright, almost a 1000 feet long and about 300 feet deep" that was observed in the sky over Phoenix, Arizona.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text I can extract from the image is:

"While on South Central in Phoenix I saw a round ball, very bright, heading southwest. The object looked about 1000 feet long and about 300 feet deep. From edge to edge it seemed to be solid. It was possibly 5000 feet and seemed to be at a distance. As to its speed, it is impossible to say, as it was very level and steady in its course. At one point there seemed to be a tail or trail about 200 feet long, from edge ways of it, it seemed to be solid on any kind."
