Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

When first sighted object was at about 33° (with ref to true north) motionless then started moving eastward slowly, accelerat. some - noted slight trail of orange-yellow light off trailing portion of circumference at first sign of motion only. At about 20° accelerate increased more rapidly until its disappearance at about 80°. At which time I would guess it was going 600 or 700 M.P.H. At the time there was an east wind 5 to 7 M.R.H. I hope this info - can be of some help arriving at an answer.

STATEMENT:

While on South Central in Phoenix I saw a round ball, very bright heading South West. The object looked about 1/2 the size of a full moon. The object did not lose or gain speed, and did not lose or gain altitude. It took about 2 1/2 min when about 1 local light at 11 seemed to be a disk. It seemed to be about 3000 feet and speed about 200 MPH. From edge way of it, it seemed to be a disk. It did not make any noise of any kind.
