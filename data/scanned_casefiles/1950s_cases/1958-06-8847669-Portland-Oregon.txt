DISCUSSION WITH THE WEATHER FORECASTER REVEAL THAT SUNLIGHT COULD BE REFLECTED FROM A SURFACE, SUCH AS AN AUTO WINDSHIELD, WHICH AND HAZE LAYER AT THE INVERSION COULD BE SEEN AT CERTAIN ANGLES. THE AGE OF THE OBSERVER SHOULD BE CONSIDERED, AS POOR EYESIGHT USUALLY RESULTS FROM OLD AGE. IN EXTREMELY BRIGHT SUNLIGHT, ALMOST ANY OBJECT, SUCH AS A LIGHT AIRCRAFT, COULD BE MISTAKEN FOR A ROUND OBJECT WHEN SEEN FROM A GREAT DISTANCE BY A PERSON WITH POOR EYE SIGHT.
