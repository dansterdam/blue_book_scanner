AF FORM 112-PART 1
(PREVIOUSLY AGO FORM 348)

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

LOCATION: VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA, USA

DATE OF INFO: 28 APRIL 1955

DATE OF REPORT: 29 APRIL 1955

PART ONE: Description of Incident

PART TWO: Supplementary Information

PART THREE: Comments of Evaluating Agency

The rest of the text in the body of the document is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned image. There are two signatures at the bottom of the document, but the names are not clearly readable. The document appears to be an Air Force intelligence report related to an incident in Van Nuys, California in April 1955.


- page 4 -

The text is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. Some words and phrases can be partially made out, but a complete and accurate transcription is not possible. There is a document header that says "SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112" and an oval-shaped object appears to be drawn or printed on the right side of the document. The rest of the text is too faint or blurry to confidently read.


- page 5 -

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Top of document header]
UNCLASSIFIED
[Partially legible form header with date fields]

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

1. A check list investigation was conducted in accordance with Air Intelligence Collection Directive (AICD) 6(c)/6(g) 660. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the nature of the object reported.

[Most of the middle text is too faded/blurry to read completely with confidence. Some words and partial sentences are visible, but not enough to reproduce accurately without risking inserting incorrect text.]

[Bottom of page shows a form number: AF 112]

Large portions of the text are illegible due to the poor scan quality and fading of the original document.


- page 6 -

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Top of document header is partially illegible]

UNCLASSIFIED

[Date and other header details are partially obscured]

[Main body of text is difficult to read in full, with many words and lines being partially or completely illegible due to image quality. Some fragments are visible but not complete enough to confidently reproduce entire sentences.]

At the bottom of the document, there appear to be signature lines, but the actual signatures are mostly illegible.

The document appears to be an official report or communication, likely related to a UFO sighting or investigation, but the specific details cannot be fully determined from this image due to poor scan quality and contrast.
