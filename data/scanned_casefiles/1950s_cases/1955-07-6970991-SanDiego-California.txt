7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
Approx twenty (20) Minutes

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One and sometimes three objects. There appeared to be two small objects to the observer, which rotated around a larger object. Blue changing to yellow. Appeared and disappeared in the NE.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
Three

9. COURSE
One, sometimes
Stationary

11. COMMENTS
Due to the age and probable inexperience of the observer the veracity of the data contained can be doubted. It is possible that while looking thru binoculars at a star the object could attain color in the process of the light passing thru the binoculars and any slight movement of the binoculars would tend to give movement to the object. The fact that the object remained in the same position would tend to support the star theory

Foreign UFO sightings are generally difficult or impossible to thoroughly investigate, or evaluate towards some firm conclusion. They would not, therefore, be considered in any statistical treatment, which primarily concerns itself with sightings within the Continental USA.
