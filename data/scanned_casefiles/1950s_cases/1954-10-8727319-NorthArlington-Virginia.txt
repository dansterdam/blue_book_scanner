At the bottom of the document, there are several date stamps and markings:
- 5 OCT 1954
- 07 28
- 06 112
- 5 OCT 54

There are also some handwritten notes, including "450" and some other partially legible markings.

The top portion of the document contains text, but it is too faint and blurry for me to confidently transcribe.
