SEVERAL RESIDENTS OF WEST PALM BEACH, FLA., REPORTED SEEING A FIERY OBJECT STREAK ACROSS THE SKY LAST NIGHT, THIS HAPPENED SHORTLY AFTER THE LAUNCHING OF AN ATLAS MISSILE AT CAPE CANAVERAL, 100 MILES AWAY, BUT WITNESSES SAID WHAT THEY SAW WAS ABOUT THE COLOR OF THE MOON AND HAD A LONG, VAPOROUS TAIL.

EARLIER YESTERDAY, A BALL OF FIRE WAS REPORTED BY SEVERAL PERSONS TO HAVE PLUNGED INTO THE BAY AT MOBILE, ALA. AUTHORITIES SAID NO PLANES WERE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN IN AREA, AND NO EXPLANATION WAS OFFERED.

TWO BLASTS, STRONG ENOUGH TO RATTLE WINDOWS AND GLASSWARE, WERE REPORTED AT MONTGOMERY, ALA. BUT THIS TURNED OUT TO BE THE ORDINARY NOISE OF JET PLANES BREAKING THE SOUND BARRIER.
