Some text appears to be partially illegible or cut off at the top and sides of the document. The visible text suggests this is a military or government document related to radar observations, with mentions of radar maintenance and no interception attempts.

Memo for Case File - TT UFO Rept.
17 July 1957 Las Vegas, Nev.

Subj: Results of Weather Conditions in UFO
Area (Byers Canyon, Utah).

1. A telephone request for weather conditions
in the approximate area (75 to 190 miles
between 60-70 degrees bearing) of the UFO
plotted on the radar scope was made to
the 6th Weather, WP-AFB on this date.

2. In contact with a Capt. Ingram and a M/Sgt.
Kermel, Phone 5 3230, the following general
summary was given:

a. There was a conditionally unstable, low
pressure frontal area.

b. Broken cumulus with 5/10 to 8/10 cloud
average up to 13,000 feet scattered at
last time.

c. Winds were negligible - generally NNW
5 to 10 knots.

Incorporated the above in
JF to witness, as possible
evidence response.

DISPOSITION FORM

FILE NO.: [blank]
SUBJECT: Radar UFO Report

TO: AFOIN-LE1
FROM: AFOIN-L24
DATE: 1 Aug 57
COMMENT NO. 1
AFOIN-L24/Capt. G.T. Gregory/vp
69216

1. In accordance with established ATIC policies for the study and appraisal of UFO radar sightings, request your review and analysis of the incident in attached teletype report, by comment hereon.

2. To possibly assist you in this matter, the following pertinent items are made a matter of note:

a. Video was turned off for one complete sweep - but object remained on the scope.

b. Area in which object disappeared (195 miles, 66 degrees from radar) is in the Bryce Canyon Area, Utah. This area has a DME and a CAA station. The electronics equipment of the latter is unknown. (See U.S. Aero Chart No. 362).

c. The line-plot from the radar station to the first turn-off point (60 degrees) and the point of disappearance (66 degrees) generally parallels a traffic airway (No. V-8) used by both civil and military aircraft. This office is not qualified to comment whether certain aircraft electronics equipment, such as ECM devices, could have some bearing on the matter.

d. A check with weather units in the area indicate that there was a conditionally unstable low-pressure frontal area, with broken cumulus activity up to 12,000 feet.

SUBJECT: Radar UFO Report

TO: AFCIN-484       FROM: AFCIN-481       DATE: 16 Aug 57       COMMENT NR. 2
ATTN: Capt. Gregory                        AFCIN-481/Mr. W. D. Bryant/jc
                                            TA(31/3263-D)/km 8

1. A check of personnel familiar with the AN/FPS-3A radar indicates that
it is possible to turn off the radar video and continue to display IFF returns.

2. The extreme speed of the alleged target eliminates the possibility that
it is a U. S. aircraft having IFF installed.

3. Normally the reflection from the target aircraft is observed, although
weaker than the IFF returns.

4. This appears to be another case of a radar sighting for which there is
no satisfactory explanation, due to lack of sufficient data.
