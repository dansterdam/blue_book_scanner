1. On 20 August 1956, the attached report was received from the group intelligence officer, 20th Air Division (Defense), Mitchel Air Force Base, New York, concerning an unidentified flying object sighted on 19 Aug 56 in vicinity of Yountsville, Arizona.

2. On 20 August 1956, the same group intelligence officer referenced above which is quoted verbatim for your information.

"On the evening of August 19, 1956, I was accompanied by Capt. John L. Barr, 20th Air Defense, Desert, into Arizona Desert, the approximate location of Burtsville, Arizona, and 2 miles to the west of State Highway 95. As previously stated, I, Capt. John L. Barr, was at the caverns approximately 20 miles southwest of Burtsville, Arizona, at a previous angle laying a constellation which is circular in nature, unusual pattern, and a white light.

I also said at this point, the pattern was a geometric pattern. To the east, southeast, I observed a light which I described as a cold, white light which used in nature. The size of this light was nearly very from a 10 degree to 25 degree angle, having nothing to gauge the actual size of the light. The difficulty to describe, however, it did not leave a trail or a pattern and appeared to be stationary. This light had a constant rate and length of time the object was seen. The light had a constant cross-traveling or cross-section which was a pure white. It did not change in color or brightness. It was stationary and did not appear to be traveling. As was stated, it was a very bright light.

"No further information can be added to this area observation as to area from west to east, and its approximate, slightly sinuous flight pattern to the west. This report of jet aircraft but could not identify it as such. The direction itself, the light was crystal clear and stationary.

"The reason is reporting this information is because I believe this information was of interest to our intelligence. I am positive this light was not a part of any aircraft. I have no further observations."

[LH8] Flying object seen n a hag in Cent. to r. Javelin, Arizona

I searched the police for two years after the incident for additional information. While I was able to get some information, however, it was impossible for me to develop visually the incident which I had seen.

"Morin, this may be of some value in searching unidentified flying objects."

4. On 21 Aug 1956, F. was interviewed and stated substantially the same information as contained in the letter dated above, and gave other further information.

5. On 21 Aug 1956, F. of California, was interviewed substantially as follows: On a August 1956, at approximately ten miles while lying in a sleeping bag near his trailer, he saw an object an... passed it out to him. The object, as he saw it, was a large, dark, somewhat metallic, oval-shaped craft. Westerly direction. The object appeared to be elliptical in shape and moved off a short distance with no visible means of propulsion.

While in his sleeping bag, he went to go to listen for slight metallic sounds. While waiting, he observed the object dim its lights, then go out completely. He stated that it was an excellent, distinct light, and at this time he observed it was stationary. He also stated that he had previously noticed an aircraft, and above forty to sixty, he could see. He stated that at first he thought the object was a high-wing aircraft, but since it was no visualization in the object or as to its continuance, rather it seemed to fade, he could not say. As a result of this, he was unable to continue observation.

He stated however, that it was impossible to estimate color, the horizon, or depth perception from view, since it was too dark. He will draw a sketch of them, give second to state what he saw, and will try to recall more details.

In the evening, object sighted was not or bells, stationary, or moving. He could not recall the exact time.
