BLANK SHEET

Subject: Aircraft
AREA REPORTED ON: Germany/West Zone FROM (address): HQ, USAFE, ATV Branch
DATE OF REPORT: 6 October 1952 DATE OF INFORMATION: 27 September 1952 EVALUATION: B-2
PREPARED BY (initials): Capt. Duramesine, Capt, USAF SOURCE: Capt. Duramesine of the French Navy

The following information was obtained by the preparing officer during an interview with Captains Duramesine of the French Navy. The purpose of the interview was to obtain details of the flying object sighted by Capt. Duramesine as required in AFR 200-5 concerning the reporting of unidentified flying objects.

1. Object was egg-shaped, luminescent in color except for a black spot in the center. Size of black spot was estimated to be approximately that of a C-47 fuselage and luminescence estimated to be black object to approximately the position where the wing tip of a C-47 would lie. Black spot was only seen when the object was cocking toward or going away from Capt. Duramesine. Exhaust that trailed the object was white. Sound was a low pitched hum. Speed was estimated to be 500 km per hour. Flight path was a straight line with no unusual maneuvers observed and no apparent spinning or turning of the object noticed. Capt. Duramesine said that before and after sighting the object he heard jets flying in the same area.

2. Time of sighting was 1730 hours Zebra, 29 September 1952. Length of time observed was about six (6) minutes.

3. Capt. Duramesine observed the object from his home which is approximately 2 km due east of the city of Mainz, Germany. The object was estimated to be over the Rhine River at an altitude of 6000 meters on a heading of about 315°. Capt. Duramesine noticed that his new home is an about three (3) km on the other side of him. It went almost directly over head, and when overhead he was unable to see the black spot.

4. Captains Duramesine is the Commanding Officer of the Gendarmerie Maritime (French Sea-Police in Germany) and has been in the French Navy for 15 years. During which time he has received several UFO reports from other days, he has stated that he has quite often seen meteors and other similar phenomena but that he has never seen anything like this before. Capt. Duramesine appeared to be very intelligent and very reliable and in the opinion of the interviewer quite credible.

5. Weather at time of sighting: 2000 feet scattered and 5000 feet scattered clouds, 12 mile visibility, winds at 1500: 10,000 feet 260° at 12 knots, 15,000 feet 260° at 51 knots, 25,000 feet 260° at 51 knots.

6. C-47 and F-84 type aircraft were flying in the local area at the time of sighting according to information received from Frankfurt Flight Service.
