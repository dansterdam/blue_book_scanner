The image contains a photograph showing a farmer observing a "weird sphere, odd lights, [and] cloud" through a telescope. The caption below the photograph states "CARL LOAR WITH HIS TELESCOPE" and describes his observation of the unidentified objects on December 7.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Weird Sphere, Odd Lights, Cloud Seen by Farmer with Telescope

A "group of weird, shining odd-shaped objects" which appeared at a tremendous altitude above the earth was observed by Carl Loar, of Rt. 2, Sunbury, Ohio, on the evening of Dec. 7, according to his observation, which he swears is true.

It was about 9:45 p. m. on Dec. 7, said Loar, when he first saw the objects through his telescope. They were shining, silvery spheres, he said, moving at high speed and flashing lights. He watched them for about 15 minutes, he said, and they suddenly darted outside the field of his telescope. There seemed to be a dozen or more of the strange objects, Loar reported.

There really isn't much more to tell about Carl Loar's story. Those are the main details as he has reported them.

The image contains a photograph depicting what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. The photograph shows an object in the sky that is described as emitting light and appearing to be of enormous size and moving at a fantastic rate of speed. The text below the photograph provides a detailed account of the observation, including details about the object's movements, size, and the witnesses' reactions.

Regarding the text found in the document:

Lear was standing in his yard observing the sky when he heard the roar of jet planes overhead. He observed the object appear to be stationary, but then suddenly began moving. The object emitted light and was of enormous size, traveling at a fantastic rate of speed. Lear called the Perkins Observatory to report the sighting. The text mentions that two tiny particles of light appeared, then on the sphere, and then a kind of explosion occurred, although there was no noise. The text also states that more specks of light kept coming until the object could no longer be seen, and that there were at least 100 in the group.

During the observation, the sphere moved from its stationary point and then traveled into the west, where it was finally hidden from view by a cloud. Lear's wife, Frances, also saw the object through the telescope, but could not manipulate it. The text states that Lear was hesitant in telling the story, but his neighbors confirmed that they had also seen the mysterious object.
