NAME: [Blacked out]
SIGNATURE: [Blacked out]
DATE: Nov. 7, 1958

Reclining in folding beach chair & watching water, noticed bright, hazy orange dumbbell shaped object from habit popular trees that line the water property. It moved across the south part of the sky, more rapidly than customary for airplanes. Motion appeared to be more or less perpendicular to dumbbell axis. In size, it was 1/2° - 1° long. In brightness, about the same in total as an airplane, but the light was diffuse or hazy, no discrete bright source.

Set up almost immediately & ran to back lot from where the southeast sky is visible. Object passed meridian 30° - 40° north of zenith, turned sharply southward for ~ 10°, then northward again. Was faint against the flow of light from shopping center, and seemed to be drifted or moving more slowly.


- page 9 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

While it was in S.E. a low flying plane flu- across the path the object had taken, headed in the direction of the Oakdale airport. Might still visible. Might the plane, though faint. Wrote to Oakdale airport on hunch that someone in the plane might have seen & reported it.

When in the S.E. the object was no long- distinctly orange or blue, dumbell shaped, but more like a whitish patch. Could not place its motion so well.

Object made no sound, and traveled on a path not much used by airplanes here.

First saw it in Aquila, it passed through northern Aquarius, I believe, and got lost in eastern Otter.

Could hardly have been visible for more than 30 seconds, but this may be underestimated, and I wish not time it. When it occurred to me to note the time it appeared, I estimated it to have 5 minutes had passed, & the time was therefore about 9:20. Could be final accuracy from the schedule of the airplane.

1. A check was made with the Army Aviation Section and it was found they have six helicopters, H-37's, stationed in San Francisco area. These aircraft fit the description given by Mr. [ILLEGIBLE]. They have an engine on each side of the fuselage driving one large rotor.

2. The conclusion of this Center is that Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] probably saw one of these H-37's flying in the area. These aircraft have been in production for approximately three years and probably are not based at very many locations.

Pleasant Hill, Calif.
October 9, 1958

Weather Bureau
Oakland Airport
Oakland, California

Gentlemen:

I would like to call to your attention an object of interest I noticed in the sky last night, ( Oct. 8 ) at about 9:20 PM, and to inquire if you have received any other reports about it.

The object itself appeared as a hazy bar of light, perhaps a degree in length, of orange color if I recall correctly, somewhat brighter at the ends than in the middle.

The object appeared in the west, passed rapidly across the sky 30 to 40 degrees south of the zenith, executed a couple of turns and wandered into the haze of light from the highway to Walnut Creek, to the southeast. At about that time, an airplane headed southwest, from the direction of Concord or Travis, crossed the path the object had taken.

For a few seconds, both plane and object were visible to me, and it is on the chance that someone might have seen it, and radio the information to the Oakland Airport, that I have chosen to write to you.

The duration of the object's appearance could hardly have exceeded 15 seconds. From the rapidity with which its size and brightness changed as it moved away, it seemed to be travelling rather low than high. It moved much faster even than low flying planes, and no sound whatsoever could be heard until the appearance of the above-mentioned plane.

It was moving much too fast to be wind-propelled, unless there were winds aloft of a few hundred miles per hour on a clear, calm, night.

The size of the object, its hazy, steady light, its ability to execute sharp turns and lack of luminous train clearly indicate it was not a meteor, several of which I also saw last night.

I would much appreciate any information you can give me on the nature and sightings of this object. I realize your department may not handle such matters, but would appreciate your bringing this letter to the attention of the Appropriate Office.

Yours very truly,

In response to your letter of 30 October 1958 with enclosed questionnaire, am returning latter filled out as well as possible. Estimates of size, distance, etc. are almost impossible to make, but comparison might be made with a small airplane, flying low and moving very fast.

I hope this information will make possible identification of the object. I would very much like to learn what it was.
