TEXT OUTPUT:

THIS REPORT REMAINS A PROBLEM. THIS IS ONE OF THE CASES WHERE THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WHICH SO OFTEN ACCOMPANIES REPORTS OF THIS NATURE IS LACKING. THERE IS NO MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHICH CAN BE STUDIED OR ANALYZED.

THE WITNESS TO THE INCIDENT APPEARS TO BE A CREDITABLE AND INTELLIGENT PERSON. HIS DESCRIPTION IS QUITE DETAILED AND CLEARLY PRESENTED.

IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A HOAX. THIS INDIVIDUAL, WHO HAS CONSIDERABLE INTELLIGENCE AND TRAINING, WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO FALSIFY SUCH A REPORT. HIS REASONS FOR REPORTING THE INCIDENT WERE QUITE APPARENTLY TO SECURE CLARIFICATION.

ADVERSELY, THERE IS ALSO NOTHING WHICH CAN BE CLASSI-FIED AS POSITIVE EVIDENCE. AND YET - ELEMENTS OF THE REPORT GIVE RISE TO SOME DOUBT.

IT DOES NOT SEEM PROBABLE THAT THE WITNESS COULD BE MISTAKEN AS TO WHAT HE SAW. HIS DESCRIPTION SEEMS TO RULE OUT OTHER COMMON NATURAL PHENOMENA. FROM THE REPORT, IT DOES APPEAR THAT SOME AERIAL OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY THE WITNESS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED.

PENDING THE RECEIPT OF FURTHER INFORMATION WHICH COULD TEND TO ESTABLISH THE RELIABILITY OF THE WITNESS OR THE EXISTENCE OF ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO ARRIVE AT A DEFINITE CONCLUSION. THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE THIS AS EITHER A GENUINE UFO OR AN EXPLAINABLE INCIDENT.

ON THE EVENING OF AUGUST 6, 1955, AT APPROXIMATELY 8:40 PM, MRS. [REDACTED], A RESIDENT OF OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT, WITNESSED AN UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENON. MRS. [REDACTED] WAS SITTING IN HER LIVING ROOM WHEN SHE OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING ACROSS THE SKY FROM EAST TO WEST. SHE CALLED HER HUSBAND, MR. [REDACTED], WHO ALSO SAW THE OBJECT. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS BEING CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, WITH A GLOWING LIGHT AROUND THE PERIPHERY. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL AND WAS TRAVELLING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 MILES PER HOUR. THE OBJECT DID NOT LEAVE ANY VAPOR TRAIL AND MADE NO SOUND. IT CONTINUED ON A STRAIGHT COURSE ACROSS THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN THE WEST.
MRS. [REDACTED] STATED THAT SHE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AND THAT SHE WAS QUITE STARTLED BY THE EXPERIENCE. SHE CONTACTED THE AIR FORCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SIGHTING TO REPORT THE INCIDENT. THE AIR FORCE SUBSEQUENTLY SENT REPRESENTATIVES TO INTERVIEW MRS. [REDACTED] AND INVESTIGATE THE CASE. ACCORDING TO MRS. [REDACTED], THE AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY EXPLANATION FOR THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD OBSERVED.

"UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT - Extract from Special Reports File - REFERENCE: SIGHTING REPORTED FROM OLD GREENWICH, CONN., JULY 28, 1955.

"On the evening of July 28, 1955, at approximately 8:10 P.M., EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME, the witness, a resident of Old Greenwich, Connecticut, observed a strange object in the sky at a height estimated to be about 1,000 feet. The object was oval or elliptical in shape and was emitting a soft glow. The witness described the object as seeming to float or glide and made no sound. The witness watched the object for about 2 or 3 minutes as it moved across the sky in a northeasterly direction and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. The witness stated that the object made no maneuvers, and he could detect no means of propulsion. He stated that the object did not resemble any known aircraft, and he could discern no wings, tail, or other appendages. The witness has had considerable experience in observing aircraft and believes the object was not a conventional type of aircraft. The witness is considered a reliable reporter.

"No other witnesses have been identified. No photographs are available."

"...thing to report of any importance) at Old Greenwich on the night of August 6, 1955. This is a late report on a sighting of a bright light in the sky which was observed by (name redacted) and his family at their residence in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. On the night in question at approximately 10:30 PM EST, (name redacted) and his family observed a bright light in the sky which was first noticed by (name redacted), who called it to the attention of the others. The light was very bright, was larger than a star, and was stationary in the sky. It was observed for approximately 15 minutes. During this time, the light changed intensity several times, becoming brighter and dimmer. However, it did not move from its position in the sky. After about 15 minutes the light suddenly disappeared. There was no sound associated with the observation. (name redacted) reported the sighting to the local police department the following day. This is the extent of the information available on this particular incident. No further details or conclusions are warranted."

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

THERE WAS NO PICTURE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT AND I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING RESEMBLING A FLYING SAUCER OR ANY OTHER UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT. WHAT I DID SEE WAS A LIGHT IN THE SKY THAT SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. IT WAS A SINGLE LIGHT, NOT FLASHING OR BLINKING, WHICH MOVED QUITE RAPIDLY FROM ONE POINT IN THE SKY TO ANOTHER. IT COVERED A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE IN A VERY SHORT TIME, MUCH FASTER THAN ANY PLANE I HAVE EVER SEEN. ALSO IT MADE NO SOUND AND GAVE OFF NO EXHAUST OR GLOW. I WOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY WHAT THIS LIGHT WAS, SINCE I HAVE NO IDEA WHATSOEVER. I SIMPLY KNOW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I HAVE EVER OBSERVED IN THE SKY BEFORE.

I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 12:10 AM ON THE MORNING OF AUGUST 6, 1955. THE LOCATION WAS AT MY HOME IN OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT. THE WEATHER AT THE TIME WAS CLEAR AND THERE WAS A FULL MOON. I WAS OUTSIDE IN MY BACKYARD AT THE TIME, SIMPLY ENJOYING THE QUIET OF THE NIGHT, WHEN I HAPPENED TO GLANCE UP AND SEE THIS STRANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 40 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND WAS TRAVELING IN A GENERALLY SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. I WATCHED IT FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. THAT IS THE TOTAL OF MY OBSERVATIONS AND I AM UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER DETAILS. ACTUALLY, I WAS SO SURPRISED BY WHAT I SAW THAT I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO MAKE ANY CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS. I SIMPLY KNOW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

THIS REPORTED CASE WAS INVESTIGATED AND TE CONCLUDED THAT:
1. THE WITNESS REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY WHICH MOVED RAPIDLY FROM EAST TO WEST.
2. THE WITNESS ATTEMPTED TO CALL HIS FRIENDS TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT BUT BEFORE HE COULD DO SO IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
3. WHEN INTERVIEWED THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE HAD SEEN A PECULIAR OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AND THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED TO A HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED.
4. THE OBJECT OBSERVED BY THE WITNESS COULD NOT BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED, HOWEVER, IT IS THE OPINION OF THE INVESTIGATOR THAT IT WAS PROBABLY A METEOR OR SOME OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON RATHER THAN AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
5. BASED ON THE MEAGER INFORMATION AVAILABLE IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THIS REPORTED CASE DOES NOT CONTAIN SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document or report. I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested.

The text in the document is as follows:

"raced to the Hopkinsville police station. The police came in force, and they searched all round the house; there was nothing to be found. No blood, no bodies. The family Kelley was in a state of terror, and there was evidence of drinking. The police finally left, and an hour after they had gone through the window for some creature they had seen did they still remain shooting through the window for another fifteen minutes, but the creature did not reappear. 

I was in Mt. Vernon, Indiana, only about 50 miles away, when this story hit the newspapers. The Evansville Courier-Press of August 22nd printed a detailed account of what claimed had happened in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, based on a news story following the event. According to the story, the Kelley family was dying. I couldn't leave at the time, so it was three days before I got there.

And when I did get to Hopkinsville, I walked into a practical joke, which is one of the things you have to watch out for when you're trying to investigate subjects like this. There were some local characters who claimed they had played a hoax on with phony "witnesses", who told me a lot of incredible and invented details. And he almost showed me a place where he said he made a plaster cast of one of the creature's. If I'd bought it, their cup would have bubbled over. I was not taken in, though. I soon lined up some other contacts.

The funny thing about this is that the hoaxers were telling an essentially true story; the sure thing is, the creatures did appear, but the family landing a-shooting was fake - but the family actually killing at all happened. Nobody has ever been able to refute the story.

Another thing that they told me was not true of the Kelley case, but it was true of another outstanding case, that of the so-called "Flatwoods Monster" seen at Sutton, West Virginia on September 12, 1952. They had draped that case around this one, and made it look like the same thing. but they had no connection whatsoever. The Sutton case was a separate incidents three days after, and they had no more substance behind these than they had behind the Hopkinsville case. The only additional evidence was a fellow came along selling subscriptions to a magazine that is printed in Augusta, Maine, and he carried a story that the magazine got their money back a couple of weeks later with instructions what agency was probing behind these shenanigans.

On January 9th of this year, at Bedford, Indiana, about 50 miles south of Indianapolis, the DOD spotted five flying saucers at one time, circling around. They had been reported over Lincoln City, Indiana, about 25 miles to the west. Just four miles down the road, about three hundred people saw them as they were following each other back and forth in the sky. The Air Force is not making much about it, of course.

1/ For a full report on the Kelley landing case, with data obtained by on-the-spot investigation, see CISI Research Report No.1, published in August, 1956."

Text from the document:

"Hopkinsville Case: This case, which has not yet been brought to the attention of the press, may cause some confusion. If understandable, it should receive the same careful investigation as any other case of this type. 

On the night of August 21, 1955, a possible identification is being considered. If authentic, it is claimed that strange figures - half human and half animal in appearance - were observed near the residence of a witness visiting from Kentucky. TV and radio broadcasters made every effort to verify the accuracy of this information, as it was reported that the witness visiting from Kentucky was an individual in whose home some strange activities had been previously described, but had not been officially without directly involving the Air Force. See attached copies of newspaper clippings (1956-1959), and the list of numerous principal persons interviewed.

The report also states that the Sheriff of the county stated that he has been reported that a native in the area stated that some creature, half human and half animal in appearance, was observed, and in the opinion of Dr. ___ Hank and the undersigned, it is possible that some members of a species ereciously unknown to science might occasionally be encountered in remote areas. The undersigned resents reading a few years ago in the New York Herald that circus owners seldom report sighting animals, until all efforts by circus crews to recapture them had failed. In many instances, the animals return on their own."

Hopkinsville Case: The report given to you that the incident was reported to "Stanford Field" gave us a little trouble. There is no Stanford or Stewart Field. The nearest AFB is Sewart in Tullahoma, Tennessee, quite some distance away. Therefore, our plan to contact the nearest AFB to Hopkinsville for particilars will be kept in abeyance pending receipt of the following information: What field was the incident reported to? Date or sighting or incident? Name the family? Would appreciate if you can help us out on this, Dr. Hynek. It seems the scrap of paper which some of this information was taken was lost or misplaced.

Report on Hopkinsville Finished, Must Still be Printed: The long-awaited "Hopkinsville Landing Report," by CSI members Isabel Davis and Arthur Lewish, has not been completed in final form. Copies containing the final conclusions may be as much as six months away. The authors consider genuine UFO encounters on the occasion to have been the most protracted and most extraordinary ever recorded. The witnesses have presented their results in detail, including maps, diagrams, photographs, and drawings of the little men. As soon as the report, 30 pages long as it now stands, will be made available to members after final revisions have been made, and a photo-offset edition has been printed.

There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. The image shows text from a document discussing a 1955 incident in Hopkinsville, Kentucky where a family was allegedly attacked by "green-goblin-like creatures" emerging from a "flying saucer" nearby. The text describes the family's use of firearms against these creatures and states that the Air Force will be asked to officially comment on the case before the book containing this information is released.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text from the document is as follows:

"33. If you may add a touch of levity to this discussion of UFO cases, we have knowledge of a rather fantastic case that has never been reported to us. UFO writers and clubs refer to it as the "Hopkinsville Case". Briefly, as the story goes, in 1955 a family near Hopkinsville, Kentucky was subjected to an all-night attack by green-goblin-like creatures which emerged from a "flying saucer" nearby. Shot-guns and rifles proved ineffective against these creatures who tried to enter the family's cabin. They left upon the break of dawn. This is a reproduction of the creatures, as allegedly sworn to by all 12 members of the family. We have been informed by a reliable contact that a book is being written on the case, and that the Air Force will be asked to officially comment, before the book is released."

SPARKINGVILLE, N.Y., 23 AUGUST, 1955

AUTHORITIES WERE NOTIFIED OF A UFO SIGHTING OVER THE GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT AREA. THEY RECEIVED A CALL FROM A MRS. SUTTON, WHO STATED SHE AND TWO OTHER WOMEN WITNESSED A LARGE LUMINOUS OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER THEIR HOME IN OLD GREENWICH. MRS. SUTTON SAID THE OBJECT WAS APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET IN DIAMETER, SHAPED LIKE A DISC, AND APPEARED TO BE SURROUNDED BY A LUMINOUS GLOW. IT HOVERED IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

MRS. SUTTON SAID THAT IS SHE CAUSED THEY USED LIGHTS ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY WERE VERY SCARED AND KEPT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW TO SEE THE OBJECT.  MRS. SUTTON SAID WHAT'S WHAT IT APPEARS (CCC) TO US THAT IT WAS A VERY HIGH UP.

A RELATIVE OF MRS. SUTTON, MRS. TAYLOR, ALSO RETURNED FROM A TRIP AND CALLED TO SAY SHE SAW THE SAME OBJECT FROM HER CAR ON THE MERRITT PARKWAY. SHE SAID IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BUS AND HAD A BRIGHT LIGHT UNDERNEATH. SHE WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE IT ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED.

THE SIGHTINGS SAID THAT A LITTLE LATER, THE OBJECT RETURNED AND HOVERED OVER THEIR HOME FOR ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS BEFORE. THEY SAID IT APPEARED TO HAVE SEVERAL SMALLER LIGHTS OR PORTHOLES AROUND THE EDGE. THE SUTTONS SAY ABOUT SIX SMALLER LIGHTS WERE VISIBLE ALONG WITH THE BRIGHT LIGHT UNDERNEATH. 

WHEN THE OBJECT LEFT, IT ACCELERATED STRAIGHT UP AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY. MRS. SUTTON SAID HER HUSBAND WAS OUTSIDE AND SAW THE OBJECT TOO. HE RETURNED HOME LATER VERY SHAKEN AND DISTURBED BY WHAT HE SAW.

THE SIGHTING LASTED ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES TOTAL. THE SUTTONS SAY THAT'S ALL THEY CAN TELL YOU. THEY ARE NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS, BUT THEY KNOW THEY SAW SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT. THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY TRACE OF THE OBJECT AFTER IT LEFT.

Text from the document:

"But as to his being deluged with flying saucer mail, I can only say to you that it was one of the smallest deluges in history. I asked my audience one night how many of them had received flying saucer reports and there were about five or six handed. Now, that is not becoming difficult. The wire has been going over 5000 letters - and I have had none personally. At the AFB building, in my office, all that came in was 2 letters and the other's were from from Mr. Henry.

He said also that we were not particularly interested in flying saucer reports unless they were something to do with his job. His reports have indicated however that in the past, on one or two occasions, people have run to him when they thought they saw a flying saucer over Dayton.

The first is a very strange thing that happened on August 21st last year and this happened that same time to people in that local police protection area, some for once it was carried by the press wires - I suppose just because they might treat it as ridiculous that I may remember the stories were about "little green men" who were reported to have come out of the skies in that neighborhood, and a little house that they ought to be green.

In the middle of the night, several people rushed from a local farm house in the little village, village to make northward to the police protection saucer that had been. These goblin-like creatures from a flying saucer who had been wondering them for three hours or more and finally vanished from the house. As it came closer, they saw it was some thing something like a little man, and next door with a huge head and enormous long arms who kept coming up to the house and the man kept shooting at them as they appeared to be friendly, but they never seemed to be wounded. It mere a discrepancy in their story from two days and finally, about 11 o'clock, the terrified family piled into the car and with no further notice or bravery less but they never seemed to be wounded.

Actually, there were only three sightings at that time. TY was murdering the past. Due to the programs that were growing a unequal, or program came to be one of the three. But I was working 12 to 14 hours a day to get the job done. I had to write so much at the beginning. I seem to have hardly any time for anything else. In the long run, it was probably a good thing - I'm certainly not going to have to be attached to anything I says I decide what I'm going to use, and how I'm going to use it."

Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

I was sitting on the back porch with the family talking about nothing particular. I remember that it was a warm summer evening in late August. I just happened to look up and notice a bright object moving across the sky from north-south-east at what must have been a great speed because of the short time that it took to vanish. When we first noticed it it was moving from our right to our left. I went inside and got my camera (a Kodak Pony 135 Model B) and took a photograph of it as it was nearest point. (I don't know what the settings were)

As we watched, it continued to move to our left and appear smaller and smaller until it had vanished.

One must take into consideration that the above incident occurred in August and it is now March. At the time that it happened I payed no great attention to the conditions at that time. The reason that I took the picture was, I thought it might be an unusual occurrence.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
July 19, 1956

Mr. ...

Shore Lands
Old Greenwich, Connecticut

Dear Mr. Donehue:

Captain Gregory of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has called my attention to a sighting of an upper atmosphere phenomena, to a remarkable photograph which you apparently took on August 1, 1955. I understand that you were unable to obtain a few more details on this. It now happens that I do not know how far this is from your home and perhaps we could arrange to meet, without too much difficulty.

I understand that you are, or were, a student at the Ohio State University. Our paths may have already crossed since I am a professor of Astronomy at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

As regards the Artificial Satellite Project, I would be glad to give you some information about it, if you like. What I would like to know is whether you could arrange to see me on that day, as I would like to get away a few points about your photograph that are not quite clear to me. Would you be kind enough to let me know whether such a meeting might be possible?

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Astronomer

MEMORANDUM FOR THE OFFICE OF SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR
SUBJECT: Case History - Colored UFO Film Slide Submitted by the UFO Research Council

1. The purpose of this memorandum is to submit a brief summary of the action taken, results reached and other significant points regarding this case. On the basis of previous trying experiences with the few UFO films and photographs submitted to the Air Force, and the controversies and complications that have later resulted, every effort was made to

2. Slide was submitted by the UFO Research Council of Cleveland during our investigation of your cases submitted to this Center. This organization has been particularly successful and their interview was granted them by ATIC in January of this year. Clearly, they are still pursuing their endeavor concerning information on unidentified flying objects and all correspondence efforts by both this office and the Intelligence Office has failed to discourage them.

3. Slide purports to show a flying object, disc-shaped and estimated at 125 feet according to the observer. See attached UFO report.

4. This office immediately prepared both black and white and colored prints of varying sizes and densities as an aid to examination and analysis (representative copies attached).

5. A three-hour conference of ATIC photo specialists was held on the morning of 8 August 1955 upon receipt of the underlined. The following were the prime conferees:
Mr. L. T. Buchwalter, Chief, Photo Section
Major W. F. Willner, Chief, Photo Analysis Branch
Mr. L. E. Griffith, Photo Specialist

6. A conference was held at WADC's Technical Photo Division, Area 3, between 0900-0930 hours regarding certain technical reproductive agencies of the film slides. Conferees were:
Captain Clemente
Mr. Hansen
Mr. Lowry
Mr. Canfield 

7. To investigate this matter from every possible angle, it was suggested that Dr. Hynek (who resides near the vicinity of Old Greenwich, Connecticut) informally talk with Dr. Hynek, the UFO photographer, to obtain some impressions regarding the source or information on the sighting.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document related to a UFO sighting.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

8. ATIC photo specialists and undersigned approached the matter from the viewpoint of an aircraft in flight. However, microscopic, macroscopic and other qualitative and analytical data included in the report does not reveal anything consistent with a flying vehicle. The trail or streak behind the object apparently resulted concurrently; from what is termed a "transonic dislocation".

9. All three ATIC photo specialists are in agreement as to the above conclusion.

10. The ATIC specialists also arrive at the same conclusion, independently and without knowledge of ATIC's findings (see para 6 above).

11. The UFO questionnaire which attempted to correlate the sighting with the probability that the source first found the object on the outside while under constant UFO report to ATIC. 

12. This office has reason to believe that this sighting was presented to members of two separate organizations. It may, therefore, receive wide-spread notoriety through newspaper articles and similar media.

13. Normally, we do not present our specific findings or conclusions to UFO sources or observers. Volume alone would make this an impossibility. However, it is the opinion of this office that the results of our specific conclusions should be made known to the individuals who make contributions to the solution of the perplexing unidentified flying objects to the effect that the contribution and results may be appreciated by the Air Force.

14. The recommendations made in the preceding paragraph may serve to curtail the private UFO organizations a constant demand for personal interviews and UFO investigations. With regard to the latter, an investigation in June of this year of all individuals submitted to us by the flying saucer observers resulted in the conclusion that the sightings had merit and, in fact, bordered on the "fantastic" or "incredible" categories.

15. In keeping with the above recommendations submitted in paragraphs 12 and 13 above, and subject to your approval, attached is a proposed reply to the head of this private UFO organization.

a. Why the red coloration?
b. Could it be a jet exhaust from a dark colored jet aircraft? (Navy jets, for example, are very dark blue, almost black, moonless night - only the jet exhaust would show).
c. Any indications of any sheath, covering or orifice at the head of this object?

As for the astronomical possibilities, I'm sure the colored prints will be of considerable assistance in determining the nature of the object."

Case (Flying Saucer File): The investigation of this case was planned as two independent investigations. By agreement of the undersigned and the undersigned, Mr. Donovan was to submit the film allegedly used on the occasion and the undersigned was to submit the results of a more-extensive series covering the file a more-detailed manner. The reported sighting was cited by censorship views (either deliberate or accidental) to contest the file.

Telephone calls had to no avail, and it was further learned Mr. Donovan has declined the delivery. Case closed.

OBSERVER REPORTS JET PLANE "TAKE" BY UFO!
Mr. Eugene Metcalf of Paris, Illinois, has reported to Project Blue Book that he witnessed a strange incident involving the "take off" of a jet plane by what he believes was a UFO. The following are Metcalf's own words as reported on March 9, 1955, at approximately 3:50 p.m.: "I witnessed the plane-taking-off while standing on my farm at home in Paris, Illinois. The plane was heading in a northeasterly direction. I stood watching this plane, and suddenly it appeared to be taken or drawn up quickly and at a sharp angle. In a split second it was gone. The whole thing appeared to be caught up and pulled up through the sky by something invisible, but the motion was no faster than the normal climb and turn of the plane after takeoff."

Excerpt from "Teleme Research Center"
as possible so that our world could know we have powerful friends in the heavens above - friendly visitors who are here to aid all mankind in many ways. Yet, that didn't make any difference to the communicating UFO's. Did they actually pick up our thoughts through the use of telepathy? - - They could highly developed remote controlled machines and knew the answers to that. But we don't know. The UFO PATROL NETWORK will be very active this Fall when May comes goes to Earth once again. If amateur astronomers and radio operators can get together and do all in their power to contact the visitors.

UFO News Report by THOMAS M. COMELLA
EXCLUSIVE RATE STUDIES AMAZING COLOR PHOTO OF UFO. TRC is now examining one of the most conclusive UFO photographs ever taken! It is not photographic detail which has convinced the TRC that the UFO involved is shown on a color Kodachrome slide.

The photographer was talking with his parents at approximately 9:00 p.m. Suddenly, a brilliant multi-colored object, described as a camera Model H, 35 mm., with lens, appeared from the south. Suddenly, it moved toward the north and followed a horizontal trajectory. At its nearest point to the observer, the photographer took the picture.
The TRC agreed that the film probably would show nothing. However, when the slides was returned from the processing laboratory, a remarkable reproduction of the object was present. The object was blue in color. It was definitely a disc-shape with a surrounding haze.
The size involved is certainly not a light from any airborne object. The photographer had a 35 mm. lens on his camera. Therefore, judging the size of the object to be a certain distance (as realized in full view of the observer), the object couldn't have been more than a meter or so in diameter!
Also, meteors follow curved trajectories, but this object didn't.

- page 49 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

Transcribed text from the document:

"Toward the ground, but this object followed a horizontal trajectory. Meteoric speeds are so fast that ordinary cameras will not stop their motion. Even astronomical cameras are not capable of this. (Photographs of meteors merely show a straight line on the film.) Also, the observer states that all witnesses watched the object for a long time in order to get a good look at it and photograph it. In such a length of time any meteoric or missile-type flight would be over. Also, the object disappeared as soon as it had been fully photographed, if it were a meteor, it would only appear as a thin, white line and not a blue-white disk.

Division of a spherical photographic is still underway. A vision photo expert has informed TRC that, in his opinion, the object in the nighttime photographs shows no indication of being some kind of space craft, nor any pattern of emission or combustion that would be characteristic of spaceships. This leads us to the conclusion that the strange trail or tail could be due to some peculiar atmospheric condition.

At any rate, the photograph remains one of the most perplexing and seemingly authentic on record.

Mr. Eugene Metcalf of Paris, Illinois, has reported to TRC complete particulars on the sighting of March 9, 1955. This sighting, as told by Mr. Metcalf, is as follows: 'On March 9, 1955, at approximately 5:50 p.m., I witnessed the 'blue-capping' of a jet plane while standing in my backyard at home in Paris, Illinois. The plane was coming toward me from the southwest at a very high speed. As it approached, a bright gleam seemed to come from behind the plane and just swallowed it up. The object had shown itself for only a split second, but while going through the blue-capping it pulsated or churned up and down, then it seemed to whirl and lifted upwards, continuing the blue-capping maneuver. When the plan came out from the blue-capping, it was going in the opposite direction. The UFOs were in perfect view and stood out clearly against the sky. The object was a bright silver and I heard no noise. I heard no noise. The object was a bright silver and I heard no noise.'

OTHER TONGUES - OTHER FLESH... This new book by George Williamson will be off the press any day now and is being published by Ray Palmer of the Amherst Press ($4.00). It's a science book, lavishly illustrated with photographs and halftones. Some 36 pages. It was first published in 1952. It attempts to make one 'picture' out of all UFO experiences. This book will give you an entirely new idea of man's existence!

- Photographic evidence of a long-time amateur photographer which shows an actual UFO encounter that occurred recently in late August, 1955. The photograph, which is a Kodachrome transparency slide, is only approximately 3 1/2" x 4 1/2" in size. The sighting took place at Old Greenwich, Connecticut. The witness, a well-known local businessman, was preparing to take a picture of the landscape when he noticed a brilliant glowing object remove toward the south. He quickly snapped a picture of it and the object appears on the slide.
Since the object was not too large in the sky, it was generally lost to view shortly after it was photographed. However, when the slide was processed and studied under magnification, the detail of the object revealed that it was a metallic disc-shaped craft, approximately 35 to 40 feet in diameter, with a central dome and a row of brightly glowing ports or windows around the circumference. This description is entirely in keeping with many other recent UFO sightings.
The clarity and detail of the photograph are such that it is beyond any reasonable doubt that the object photographed is an actual UFO. However, as is the usual case, the witness preferred to remain anonymous and the color transparency slide has not been made available for general public inspection. Nevertheless, the IRC investigators have had an opportunity to study the slide in detail and are satisfied that it represents the most authentic color photographic evidence of a UFO to date.

OBSERVER REPORTS JET PLANE THAT FOLLOWED BY UFO! 
On March 5, 1955, at approximately 7:45 A.M. Mr. E. G. reported the following:
"I was on my way to work, traveling about 50 miles per hour, on the Connecticut Turnpike, in the vicinity of Old Greenwich, Connecticut. As I approached the curve in the highway, I noticed a jet plane flying overhead and slightly to the right. As I watched it, I suddenly saw an object following the plane at a distance of about 500 feet. This object was traveling at a speed far in excess of the jet plane.
"The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and seemed to be slightly larger than the jet plane. It was a dull, metallic color and had no lights or markings visible. It was traveling in a horizontal position and maintained a constant distance from the plane. 
"I watched the object follow the plane for about two to three minutes, then it suddenly accelerated and shot up into the atmosphere and disappeared from sight. The jet plane continued on its course.
"This is the only UFO I have ever seen, and I am positive it was not an ordinary aircraft. I have had considerable experience in observing airplanes, both civilian and military, and this object was definitely not an airplane of any kind that I am familiar with."

SUBJECT: Request for Colored Prints of UFO
TO: AFOIN-H2
FROM: AFOIN-H2
DATE: 6 Aug 55
COMMENT NO. 2

1. The basic request for color prints of UFO has been complied with (see Inclosure No. 2, 2 ea prints approx 3 x 5", and 2 ea prints approx 5" x 7").

2. The slide of approx 3" x 5" prints does indicate tonal variations with the type equipment utilized. The magnification for the 3 x 5" print is approximately 13 times; the reproduction for the 5" x 7" print is approximately 37 times. The grain size of the color film at 13 magnification clearly indicates that the sharpness clarification would only be enemy and devoid of any additional details.

3. The reproductions indicate that there is a slight possibility that what appears to be an object in space is a small coating defect in the emulsion/or a tiny particle contamination, unrelated and contributing to the emulsion density characteristics.

4. The slide shows numerous physical defects from handling. It is therefore suggested that, prior to further analysis, it be duplicated in order to preserve its possible value to the Center.

IEUR. LHAHCHID

The night of 13 July, 1955, about 10:00 p.m. While driving along west port avenue in old Greenwich, Connecticut, I observed what appeared to be a bright light in the sky. This light was extremely bright and changed colors from orange to white. it appeared to be some distance away and was moving rapidly from a southeastern direction toward the northeast at a fairly high altitude. The light seemed to be under some type of control as it suddenly stopped and then changed direction and started moving rapidly in a different direction. This light was observed for about 5 minutes and then seemed to disappear. I am quite certain that this was not an aircraft light or a satellite, as I am quite familiar with the appearance of such objects in the sky. This light seemed to be under some type of intelligent control and did not follow the normal path of an aircraft or satellite.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly related to Project Blue Book, that contains text describing a UFO encounter.

The text reads as follows:

"Not too long ago, I was reading Miss Jacqueline Saunders' article in Gray Barker's The Saucerian Review, under the title, 'Panic in Kentucky'. It is an able account of the Hopkinsville, Ky., family who did battle for several hours last summer against some little men from a flying saucer. While I read this dramatic report (being pretty much a critic of such things), a persistent question kept voicing itself in my mind: 'Can this really have happened?' Suddenly in telling how the 'little men' approached the house from a landed saucer, the writer said: 'According to some of the witnesses they were not walking, but seemed to float toward the house.' Those words, it seemed to me, 'rang a bell'. Where had I heard them before? Then I knew! I dug into some of my files and came up with a letter which I had received from one John J. Swaim, a farm boy from near Coldwater, Kansas, who in response to our request, had written me in October 1954, to tell of an encounter he had had with a 'little man' and a saucer while discing in a field some weeks before. Here is a line taken from his penciled letter: 'I came on a terrace. He was crouched behind it. He jumped up and looked at me, and kind of floated as he jumped into the saucer and it lighted up and took off. It went out of sight. ... ' Had the folk from near Hopkinsville read John Swaim's description and used it to dress up their own hoax? I very strongly doubt it! To me, this is one of those subtle similarities which make us think twice before saying, 'This story is just a story and nothing more!'"

being emotionally upset, and discussing the article and showing pictures of this little monkey, that appeared like a man. their imaginations ran away with them and they really did believe what they saw, which they thought was a little man.
The home that Mrs. lived in was in a very run down condition and there were about eight people sleeping in two rooms. The window that was pointed out to be the one that she saw the small silver shining object about two and a half feet tall, that had its hands on the screen looking in, was very low window and a small monkey could put his hands on the top of it while standing on the ground.
It is felt that the report cannot be substantiated as far as any actual object appearing in the vicinity at that time.

4002D AIR BASE SQUADRON 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
CAMPBELL AIR FORCE BASE
Fort Campbell, Kentucky

The following statement was given to me by Major John E. Albert on 26 September 1957:

On about August 22, 1955, about 9 A. M., I heard a news broadcast concerning an incident at Kelly Station, approximately six miles North of Hopkinsville. At the time I heard this news broadcast, I was at Gracey, Kentucky on my way to Campbell Air Force Base, where I am assigned for reserve training. I called the Air Base and asked them if they had heard anything about an unidentified flying saucer report. They stated that they had not and it was suggested that as long as I was close to the area, that I should determine if there was anything to this report. I immediately drove to the scene at... Station and located the home belonging to a Mrs.... (A copy of Mrs... statement is attached to this report.)

Deputy Sheriff Batts was at the scene where this supposedly flying saucer had landed and he could not show any evidence that any object had landed in the vicinity. There was nothing to show that there was anything to prove this incident.  

Mrs... was an impoverished widow woman who had grown up in this small community just outside of Hopkinsville, with very little education. She belonged to the Holy Roller Church and the night and evening of this occurrence, had gone to a religious meeting and she indicated that the members of her family and some friends of her sons', were also at this religious meeting and were worked up into a frenzy, becoming very emotionally unbalanced and that after the religious meeting, they had discussed this article which she had heard about over the radio and sent for from the Kingdom Publishers, Fort Worth, Texas and they had sent her this article with a picture which appeared to be a little man when it actually was a monkey. This article had to be returned to Mrs... as she stated it was her property. However, a copy of the writing is attached to this statement and if it is necessary, a photograph can be obtained from the above mentioned publishers.

It is my opinion that the report of Mrs... of her son's encounter with two persons, either they caused by one of two reasons. Either they did see what they thought was a little man and at the time, there was a circus in the area and a monkey might have escaped, giving the appearance of a small man. Two, that this article, showing the picture of the small man, emotionally unbalanced this religious group and caused the incident.

KELLY INVASION IS WORLD - WIDE LEGEND

The battle of Kelly -- pitting man against creature -- has long since been lost. But its strange phenomena are apparently still being talked and re-fought at all four corners of the globe. 

It has been two years since the now-legendary Martian invasion was staged in North Christian, but it was only yesterday that Hopkinsville Police Chief Russell Greenwell received his 150th query into the episode.

The writer, Heinrich Shumacker, recently read about the weird visit by the little green men and is seeking newspaper accounts of the four-hour gun battle required to expel the reported attack.

The letter is just one of a barrage of inquiries that Chief Greenwell has received since Hopkinsville's night of Aug. 21, 1955. Similar letters have been received from curious readers in every state in the union as well as from countries in Europe, Mexico and several South American nations.

The incident received nation-wide publicity shortly after some "12 or 15 little bug-eyed green men" supposedly landed their space ship on the Gannon brothers farm eight miles north of this city.

Seven persons in the area claimed they waged a four-hour shotgun and rifle battle with the outer space creatures. City, county, state and even military authorities were called to the scene to probe the weird reports.

In addition to the letters the police chief has received pamphlets, magazines and other writings relating to flying saucer stories. One magazine, "Saucer Review," published about a month ago, carried a seven-page article describing the Hopkinsville "encounter" with these other space creatures.

The chief said that to this day he, among others, didn't know whether to believe or disbelieve the story of the little green men and their space ship. "There has been much speculation of this mystery but nothing factual to prove or disprove the 'invasion.'"

Deputy Sheriff Batts said the men told him that in all they fired up about four boxes of .22 pistol shells. The officer guided a neighbor saying he hears shooting over at the Suttons but distinguished only about four shots and mistook them for fire-crackers.

Most of the officers remained at the site for more than two hours. During that period there were approximately 25 persons at the scene.

Only excitement during the period the officers were there came when a MP happened to step on a cat's tail while walking in the darkness near the house. The cat let out a squawl and for a few seconds there was much activity and scurrying around on the part of those present.

Two officers who returned to the Kelly area early this morning reported hearing that the "little men" had reappeared around the Sutton home about 3:30 a.m. 

Other investigators who went to Kelly later during the morning said they were told Sutton and Taylor had gone to Evansville today.

Officers who visited the scene during last night's excitement were reluctant to express any opinion today in regard to the reported invasion of Kelly. All officials appeared to agree that there was no drinking involved.

Only outspoken comment came from Frank Dudas, city police desk sergeant, who was not on duty last night and has not visited the scene so far. He said, "I think the whole story is entirely possible."

Sergeant Dudas was one of two city policemen who reported seeing three flying saucers early one morning last summer. He said, "I know I saw them. If I saw them, the Kelly story certainly could be true."

Four city police, Chief Russell Greenwell, T. C. Cross, Dorris Francis, and George Salter, drove to the scene to check the "little men". By radio, contact was made with State Trooper R. N. Ferguson, Jr., and G. W. Riley and Deputy Sheriff George Batts, all of whom joined the motorcade to Kelly in their own vehicles. Four M. P.'s also went.

The radio discussions also brought two Hopkins County deputy sheriffs and at least three state troopers from the station at Madisonville.

First arrivers found the scene deserted. The two cars which had brought the report to Hopkinsville did not return to the Kelly farm until after officers had arrived and looked the situation over.

Officers reported they found no tracks of "little men" nor was there any mark indicating anything had landed at the described spot behind the house. There was a hole in the screen at the window through which occupants said a shot had been fired at one of the strange little men.

Both Chief Greenwell and Deputy Sheriff Batts said they got approximately this story from the still terrified and excited Sutton and Taylor families.

About 7 p. m. one of the men went out of the house to get a bucket of water. He saw what looked like a flying saucer come over the trees and land in a field about a quarter of a mile behind the house. There was no explosion, only a semi-hissing sound, and the watcher returned to the house with the bucket of water.

A short time later somebody reported some little men with big heads and long arms were approaching the house. The men were described as having huge eyes and hands out of proportion to their small bodies. The visitors were wearing what looked to be metal plate.

The men got their guns, a shotgun for Sutton and a .22 caliber target pistol for Taylor. By and by one of the little men pressed his face against the window and the shotgun was fired through the window. The face disappeared.

The men decided to go outside and see if the visitor had been hit. Taylor was in front and when he emerged from the front door, a huge hand reached down from the low roof above the door and grabbed him by the hair. He pulled away, and the two men went on out of the house.

One of the strange little men was in a nearby tree, another on top of the house. A blast from Sutton's shotgun knocked another one of the men down, but he did not appear hurt. He disappeared in the darkness.

Taylor reportedly opened fire on other members of the invading party, also with little effect. The battle went on for something over an hour. When the occupants of the house saw their chance, they jumped onto their cars, and drove to Hopkinsville.

STORY OF SPACE-SHIP, 12 LITTLE MEN PROBED TODAY
KELLY FARMHOUSE SCENE OF ALLEGED RAID BY STRANGE CREW
LAST NIGHT; REPORTS SAY BULLETS FIRED TO AFFECT VISITORS
All kinds of investigations were being conducted today in connection with the bizarre story of how a space-ship carrying 12 to 15 little men landed in the Kelly community early last night and battled occupants of a farm house.
Most official of the probes was reportedly being staged by the Air Force.
More than a dozen state, county and city officers from Christian and Hopkins counties went to the scene between 11 p. m. and midnight and remained until after 2 a. m. without seeing anything to prove or disprove the story about the ship and its occupants.
The farmhouse is located on the Old Madisonville Road about eight miles north of Hopkinsville. The property is occupied by Cecil (Lucky) Sutton, one of those who reported experiencing last night's phenomena.
There were some 10 or 12 persons at the house, including several children, but investigating officers were not able to determine exactly how many of those present actually claimed to have seen any of the little men from the space ship.
Only other person whom officers quoted directly was identified as Billy Ray Taylor, a visitor from Pennsylvania which recently had a similar report of a space ship. Neither Sutton nor Taylor was at home when officers returned to the scene this morning.
The story broke about 11 o'clock last night when two cars, one bearing a Pennsylvania license drove up to Hopkinsville's police headquarters. Officers then at the station said the two adults contained at least five and several children. All appeared highly excited.
Spokesman for the crowd told of how something resembling a space ship or flying saucer had landed at the back of their house near Kelly and 12 or 15 men, who appeared to be about 4 feet tall, had got out of the ship and come up to the house and done battle with the occupants.
"We need help", one of the men said, "We've been fighting them for nearly four hours".

My name is [redacted], age 50 and I live at [redacted], Hopkinsville Route 6, Kentucky.

On Sunday night Aug 21, 55 about 10:30 P. M. I was walking through the hallway which is located in the middle of my house and I looked out the back door & saw a bright silver object about two and a half feet tall appearing round. I became excited and did not look at it long enough to see if it had any eyes or move. I was about 15 or 20 feet from it. I fell backward, and then was carried into the bedroom.

My two sons [redacted], age 25 and his wife [redacted], age 29, [redacted], age 21 and his wife [redacted], age 27 and their friends [redacted], age 21 and his wife [redacted], age 18 were all in the house and saw this little man that looked like a monkey.

About 3:30 A. M. I was in my bedroom and looked out the north window and saw a small silver shining object about 2 1/2 feet tall that had its hands on the screen looking in. I called for my sons and they shot at it and it left. I was about 60 feet from it this time. I did not see it anymore.

I have read the above statement and it is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Text extracted from the document:

It should be an easy task to look back through the newspaper's files covering that period and find the articles. The story was that the farmer had requested that the newspaper to publish, and they never did give it a very big play as I remember. It died a natural death as for days nothing was ever said about it. It never did receive national recognition, and the wide coverage. Furthermore, the story became more distorted with each succeeding write-up of the farmer and his family.

An interesting sidelight was the fact, told to me by several of the local authorities, that the farmer put up signs at the entrance to his property and was charging $1.00 per head, "to see where the 'Man-Has-Landed'".

As for the report, the affair was investigated and reported upon by two Air Force Officers from Campbell Air Force Base. I don't believe that there is any facts in this, I believe that a couple of our officers may have gone down-on their own- to view the place, as I heard some talk of this at the time, but Colonel Donald McPherson, the Base Commander certainly never ordered any official investigation, to the best of my knowledge.

I seem to remember Captain Benjamin Bennett saying something about going down to see the spot, but since he is still stationed there, surely you have already questioned him regarding this matter.

The only other officer who may have looked into this matter was the Deputy Base Commander, Major Jerre B. Ogden, now stationed at Manchester Air Force Base, who investigated the incident, and he could possibly have been sent to the scene by Colonel McPherson, in an unofficial capacity, without my knowing about it.

Thats about all I recall of the incident. At the time, Col. McPherson figured that there wasn't anything to it, and we all followed suit, so to speak. There seemed to be nothing at all in the story that would in any way lend credence to it, so we all promptly forgot it.

In closing, I'd like to point out, that out of all the cases that I investigated for the commander and out of all the incidents that happened around Campbell during my three and a half years there, this incident impressed me the least, and therefore, I was never even remotely connected with it. It follows then, that my memory concerning this incident is rather faulty and I am not even sure exactly when it took place. Therefore I'm afraid I haven't been of much help, and for this I apologize.

17 September 1957

Dear Kirk:

I just returned from TDY today, and found your letter regarding the alleged Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on or about 21 August 1955.

I do remember this incident vividly, but I'm afraid I can't help you much since I was not directly connected with it. That being the case, I am therefore answering request in this informal manner and the following is, to the best of my knowledge, all that I can recall:

Prior to the above incident, several months earlier I believe we had another relating alleged incident from the Hopkinsville area. This earlier incident took place on the farm, (just south of Hopkinsville), of a Mr. _____ (I think his name was ____ ).

Briefly, Mr. _____ and a negro handy-man employed by him had observed an unidentified object streak across the sky, perform several abrupt changes of course, and finally disappear in the direction from whence it came. This was allegedly witnessed by two other witnesses that were present, that I think that there was another witness or two at the time.

The individuals involved in this earlier incident were a prominent citizen of the area, and the senior member of the largest local insurance and finance company. The accuracy of their description of the object and its maneuvers was very accurate. Some credence was lent to the story, we therefore reported this incident in accordance with AFR 200-2 by Confidential Message.

I mentioned the above preceding incident, (of which I have personal knowledge since I personally investigated it), because it preceded, to the best of my knowledge, the famous "Hopkinsville incident". It was not long after the "Whitehouse incident" that we heard of the Hopkinsville incident- perhaps they could be associated?

To my knowledge, the _____ incident was first investigated, and thoroughly so, by the State Highway Patrol, and later by the Sheriff's Office. The incident was never officially reported to the Air Force. In fact, the first I remember hearing about it is when several persons at Campbell brought to my attention an article about the incident which appeared in the local Hopkinsville paper.

2. The Air Force has been informed by reliable sources that an article on this incident may soon appear in a magazine publication, and that the Air Force will be queried regarding its opinion or explanation.

3. Seeking factual, concerning data, no evidence can be given for this fantastic report as the incident has never been officially recorded in any permanent Air Force matter. However, two important factors prompt this request:

a. Previous experience with sensational articles of this type show that almost invariably a large number of inquiries and allegations against the Air Force soon follow, from both the press and public, and
b. An unidentified aerial object, engaged over the area and reported upon by two Air Force officers from Campbell Air Force Base, 
This Center; which is responsible for evaluating incidents of this nature under provisions of AFR 200-2 "Unidentified Aerial Objects," has indicated a need for such reports.

4. To assist you with respect to any inquiries or investigations, this request is forwarded, requesting any pertinent information, critique, and the Hopkinsville Police Department. The Chief of Police at Hopkinsville was a witness to this incident and is believed to still be on active duty.

Prof. J. Allen Hynek

Cambridge 38, Mass.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

You will by now have learned of the accomplishments of the semi-miraculous events of procuring your "My Fair Lady" on July 11th. Hope nothing has come up that will make this date inconvenient for you after all. Good thing you didn't make an ironclad plan for that would have been altogether impossible. No doubt you will be rather disappointed in the show for I am yet to learn how anything like it could have been produced. 

I certainly hope you will be able to make time to have a schmooze with us as we have plenty of things to talk about and it goes without saying that we are excited by the alluring suggestions you last put in our hands. It would probably fascinate communication of interesting things on paper, but I appreciate the risks you would be taking, and I imagine that your caution is well founded. It does seem unnecessary and irritating that scientists have irrational prejudices (which I suppose will be forever) where will always be an area of concern that must be stigmatized as heretical and it is no use complaining that scientists ought not to be so anti-scientific. One must recognize that they are, and choose appropriate precautions, as you are doing.

I believe you will be interested in Isabel Davis's data on the Hopkinsville landing, which includes two versions, with witness-checked drawings. One was made by two independent investigators the day after the event. Thus we learn not only that the case is undoubtedly "solid" (which Isabel's overwhelming investigation confirms), but also a good deal of information of interest to comparative biologists about the behavior of creatures which apparently "incomprehensibly" impressed witnesses in this case markedly differed from the sort of thing we are accustomed to on this planet. Probably you have not had this information before, as it appears that the Air Force investigators showed little interest in the drawings when offered them: quite probably they "visually didn't see what a trained person would naturally see on superficial examination."

It appears that the little men of Kelly were not very anthropoid, evidently differing from the heavy-set, hairy, muscular little fellows of Venusian culture, though identification with these ones seems more certain. and this is something again (August 21, 1955.) Three feet only in stature, they resembled the conventional "Martians", spindly in build, except for a barrel chest, with small heads out of proportion to their bodies, hairless with no visible eyes or pupils, were set at the sides of the head, as in prawns and primitive fishes. They were bothered by light, and could be driven off with a flashlight beam, clear evidence that they could not adapt their visual sensory mechanism to illuminations brighter than their customary environment.

Dear Captain:

I had hoped until the last minute that you would be able to make a date for conferences since now it appears that you cannot. I did hope to get down but the present state of affairs here makes that impossible, but the rest will have to wait until next month. I leave for California temporarily, and I have a lot of things to see off.

First, I had been meaning to tell you for a long while that shortly after I saw the same thing on the station, suddenly I got the impression that I had been studying the thing at the same time that somebody else was filming it. It seems to me most peculiar that if the object is brilliant in the sky would not have had to seen truly spectacular. This would have been noticed by a great many people and perhaps with binoculars. Its brilliance would suggest in the sky would have been truly spectacular. This would have been noticed by a great many people and perhaps with binoculars. Its brilliance would suggest in the sky would have been truly spectacular. This would have been noticed by a great many people and perhaps with binoculars.

I strongly leaned to the latter hypothesis, and just yesterday I learned from Miss Hoover that you had also come to the conclusion by other means that the thing was a hoax. Why will people persist in being lackeys? What can they hope to gain?

"donce that strong sunlight is not encountered on their planets, or that their habits of life is unrecognized. One of the hard-to-believe feature of the case is that bullets (from a shotgun and a .22 pistol), fired by good marksmen at short range, crossed and so on (according to their belief) could achieve no permanent damage, but only a temporary discomfiture. (Of course--and this is a point that just occurred to me--such "brushing off" the bullets (as sure silver bullets!) Another incredible point, psychologically this time, is that in spite of reserving a very conspicuous hostile reception, they persisted for hours in besieging the farmhouse, even coming up to the screened windows and putting their hands upon the screen.
These hands, borne on arms so long that they almost reached the ground, were large, claw-like, and rubbery. There can be no doubt (about this, because of the behavior mentioned above, which gave at least some of the witnesses a chance to observe the details in question.) that they were humanoid to the point of looking like chimnanzees. One account says they had no thumbs--this is again almost incredible.
The ears were enormous, and movable, like little elephant ears. (Suggesting a kind atmosphere: &/or disguise; rather than a predatory carnivore.) One account says that when they were sighted at (which probably was painful so intensively increased, for) they were luminous (like many of the persons animals), though not phosphorescent, as nervous had it. Only yellow flash (diminished or by reflection?) of the great eyes had a greenish cast.
The drawings all depict an apparently nude creature (lacking sexual organs, however), but the skin appeared metallic, so that some close-fitting garments may have concealed.
The feet were not like ours. One account says they resembled suction cups. They drew no well except footprints "They were not at all clear, possibly because mostly in the grass."
It is certain that the creatures can counteract gravitation. Thus they "flickered" gliding, much as we do under water. This, their ability to leap into trees, or onto the roof, does not imply powerful muscles. For on occasions a bizarre home position, as claws and a large body torso, appeared to be well-muscled in their own right.
The mouth was a wide slit. The nose none uncertain. The cranium was formidable, and totally bald. They uttered no sound.
They appeared to react suddenly on invasion. When approaching the house they generally raised their arms in the air. though this was apparently a rather theatrical gesture. Yet it can well imagine, through which, that the effect was alarming, even one supposes that it was meant as a signal of peace-full intentions. Once one was on a little stoop over two door when one of the creatures suddenly appeared, he battened down his hair (?). He patted his head, but drew back at once. This was often he had been."

The image does not contain any photographs. However, I will proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

Rassel Davis will hold forth upon all this (and upon her interests with old occult coverall) who is now a member of U.S.A.F. (the other Hopkinsvlile, Kentucky people, etc.). Perhaps you can't manage to make this, which may be just as well, for donating $3.00 would be well within our less impossible members will doubtless be present. She'll tell you all you want to know when we meet. She spent a week there and used her time well.

We're delighted to hear that the Handbook crown has passed to another head, and a sensible one; perhaps something can be done in the near future to dignify the misnomer of suspicion around the Air Force's bins, secrecy, and preparations of the past. (Though will it ever be possible to satisfy them for admitting the reality of such things as I have just described? Well, we need not insist on that.)

The colored slide picture which I gather you have personally investigated, sounds exactly like the Lubbock lights (pardon this statement of the obvious!) and we hope you will be able to obtain a copy of that mysterious manifestation. Their "confidential" flying saucers seems likely, and I would be delighted if they can be located in some way.

Getting around rather late to one of the points raised in your letter, let us say that we Daly agree with our criticism of Mitchell's version of the Mantell case. It is clear all right, but it is not accurate. After all, it is doubtful whether that thing was a hopeless tangle past sorting out, we simply added a footnote. Mitchell's version of the sighting should be compared with that given by Ruppelt, etc. and let it go at that. Then the public, not caring for this implied criticisms, simply discarded the footnote, and there you are.

For the implication concerning simply reducing the number of files, and there you are - at present the indexes have been gone over, and the book was rushed to press with our editing only half done, because the publisher said such changes were becoming too expensive. The index was a rush order, only one night allowed; result, many careless omissions, such as "ought to" for "ought to have," etc. ... The publisher changed the pagination slightly, and threw many of the references out by one page. It is our impression that this publisher are particularly interested in printing something inexpensive, though they don't seem to be much concerned about the way it looks when it comes out. 

Still, it seems we should be rather careful about "hinting around." It seems to be a matter of responsibility. Someone is certain to take it all seriously, and be scandalised by what we never meant - at least, that's the way it seems to me. I patched this up in Part 3, but Part 1 was Tody's and he didn't catch the error. The Chalmaine's photograph, which so impressed the conference-rounded blurb-writer, is patently a fake, so doubtedly. Actually, it is the Termination of some innocent experiment with light refraction.

Most of the illustrations are non-sensical and should have been left out. I must take responsibility for what I suspect is the wrong labeling of the so-called "arrivals" in the introduction, and I see that it is Wood is against me in the matter of magnification by Palta Morana, though I intend to oppose this experiment and see more of the so-called less. These diagrams are a big improvement on Michel's originals.

It agrees with your disappointment in the UFO film; it is as far from an honest documentary.

Thanks very much for taking time to write, and hope to see you in the future!

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document from a public meeting of the Civilian Saucer Intelligence of New York on April 28, 1956. The speaker was Frank Edwards.

CIVILIAN SAUCER INTELLIGENCE OF NEW YORK
Public Meeting of April 28, 1956
Pythian Temple, 135 West 70th Street, New York City
Speaker: FRANK EDWARDS

The meeting was opened by A. D. Mebane, Secretary-Treasurer. Before introducing Frank Edwards, the speaker of the evening, he described briefly the history and present status of C.S.I. (of N.Y.), its membership of 100, and directed the audience's attention to the wall display of clippings, photos and information about the current commentary in the U.S. press on UFOs.

Frank Edwards' career in broadcasting has spanned virtually the entire history of electronic communication. As an aviator in the early 1920s, he became one of the radio announcers in 1933 and has been on the air ever since, doing the news commentary for the Mutual network. This broadcasts then also known by all scientists and millions of broadcasting millions of millions of people who knew he could be depended on to give a full and fair account of events that would never appear in the newspapers. At the time when sponsors would not department from the "party line" program - because of his refusal to submit to censorship - he was probably the country's best-known exponent of "living dangerously." Since that time he has been appearing daily on television station WTTV, Indianapolis, where he has continued to bring to the public the latest news about UFOs.

Surprisingly enough, although radio and television have brought him such renown in the field of flying-saucer investigation, his talk this evening was his first in-person public lecture on the topic.

One chapter of Frank Edwards' autobiography, My First Ten Million Sponsors, published by Ballantine, is devoted to the flying saucer story, and is one of the best short treatments of the subject that has yet appeared.

A summary of Mr. Edwards' lecture follows.

FLYING SAUCERS -- IN, ON, AND OFF THE AIR
(Condensation of a talk by Frank Edwards before C.S.I. of N.Y.)

Before we get into this, I'd like to say that I don't profess to be an expert on flying saucers. I don't know any more about them than you do. I'm a case reporter. I've dealt with a lot of stories, some of which were just as complex, confusing, and aggravating. I've dealt with it from the standpoint of a reporter who has found a very interesting story.

My interest in this field goes back a good many years. Back in the early 1930s, when I was just a kid, I used to fly an old Jenny bi-plane with a 90-horse power engine and a wooden propeller - it was prehistoric - and the sightings that started then I could never get out of my cockpit. One night I was in the office of an outfit known as the "Eastern Flying Services," where a famous aviator, was there. He was telling about something that had happened to him in the air over Newark Airport, the famous Saucer Acosta, the famous aviator, was there. He was telling about something that had happened to him in the air over Newark Airport, the famous saucer incident in which several other pilots had participated. This was in 1933. WTTV, Indianapolis, where he has continued to bring to the public the latest news about UFOs.

Colorado the preceding year --that would be 1922 or 1923. Two or three things that looked like "flying saucers" had come up to his plane and flown around it. He said he couldn't see what's kept them in the air, but they had no difficulty at all in sticking on his tail. They were more or less round, and perhaps 2 inches away from his wings. He said he'd never seen anything like it in all his years of flying. Then a couple of times they slowed up and said about the same size--they were just like pearly particles and seemed millions of miles away. It seems those "big fellows" were, but I have a hunch that they were what we now call flying saucers.
A few years after that, on August 5, 1926, there was a sighting by Nicholas Roerich on the Himalayan expedition. Members were a shiny disk-shaped object, which seemed metallic, through binoculars. And this thing, too, was apparently what we call a flying saucer.
Of course, you folks who have delved into this subject know that these things are not of recent vintage--neither have they been seen over a long period of time. But it wasn't until June, 1947, that the big flying-saucer story broke out on us. Actually, the story, according to Kenneth Arnold, ought to have broken on June 25th. On that day, a railroad engineer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, saw several shiny metal objects flying in a strange, jerky manner, like wild geese, as he said. He called them the "saucers" when he got back and told his friends he had seen them.
I suppose, hallucinations) -- and he estimated that they were flying at about 1600 miles per hour. That story only got circulation, because newspapers do not regard railroad engineers as authoritative witnesses on sightings.
But, the next day, the 24th, when Kenneth Arnold saw nine things flying in the Cascade Mountains, was a different story. Because the observer was a veteran flyer--a friend of mine, incidentally, and I have a high regard for him. His name was Kenneth Arnold, and he made the headlines, as you know, from coast to coast. After that, things were seen in the country, and eventually, all over the world.
By the summer of 1948, some friends of mine up in Alaska were writing to me to say that they were seeing queer things in the sky up there--I had known those people in Alaska quite a bit in years gone by--and in the summer of 1948 I went up there again to talk to these people whose names they had names. Unfortunately they turned out to be very poor pictures--merely bad cameras, but I had some very interesting conversations with people I know.--whom I regarded as credible witnesses, and I got a lot of course, let of people whom I did not consider credible at all. One little lady told me that all the little people in the hollow tree, and the couple of jet pilots from Elmendorf Air Base, whom I met incidentally, had said there were flying over the Brooks Range, under a layer of cloud or ice crystals, at about 30,000 feet. They decided that they'd go up and take a look at these gentlemen. They found themselves up above on this layer. They said when they came down, the others, the jet pilots, were gone--they were flying over the Brooks Range. under a layer of cloud or ice crystals like a repetillian" craft from outer space, and over on this layer above on this layer. They decided that they'd go up and take a look at these gentlemen. They found themselves up above on this layer. They said when they came down, the others, the jet pilots, were gone--they were flying over the Brooks Range. under a layer of cloud or ice crystals like a repetillian" craft from outer space, and every 3-29 "Fussage" with no tail and no wings: there was some flame coming out the back and it was moving at a speed of about 1600 mph. They saw no windows.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

they saw no apertures of any kind, they saw no antennae - in fact, they saw nothing except the smooth surface which had a metallic gloss to it. She said they decided to follow the thing. But just as he started to take off after it, a stream of orange flames which came from the sides of the object, and which accelerated rapidly, and ran off and left those things that they had been watching. They last saw the thing making about 1000-1200 mph when they last saw it, and it was climbing rapidly.

They got back to base and reported what they had seen. They were immediately confined to quarters and they were subjected to grilling for several days. In fact, they were told that one of them was not allowed to sleep for for 48 hours. They were interrogated to the extent that they became convinced that they had better keep their mouth shut about the whole matter, "or else."

On the way I left Alaska, two Air Force Intelligence men came to see me. They underscored that I must not repeat any of this since it was classified "top secret." They really didn't tell me anything I'd like to know. Well, I asked them the usual questions and I got the usual round-about answer. They told me that these things were "very real." They were our very latest secret developments. Could be, I argued, but I wouldn't tell them that we said this, because we had these things timed to break just before holidays, and once they took the usual operation for granted, they'll leave them alone. Well, I concluded my testimony with him. But I don't think I convinced him that I'd keep my mouth shut. For quite a while, I thought those Air Force men had told me the truth. But I

If the saucers are ours. We've certainly wasted billions of dollars in the nine years since 1947 building airplanes that can't even come close to the things-and don't think they are ours and I don't believe they are anybody else's on this earth.

I believe that these things are real. I believe that they are very substantial, and I believe that they are intelligently controlled. And this is not guess-work on my part; in writing, in documents which I have in my lock box where supposed can't get at them. I believe that these things are in the words of these physicists "unconventional and exceedingly high-speed devices, well tested and operated by individuals who know more about this planet than we do."

To show you just how solid the people are who made that statement, I'd like to go back to one day in October 1952, when stories appeared that I were on a television program called "Author Meets The Critics," debating flying saucers with Willy Ley. The famous German writer and rocket expert, - About half way through the show, I leaned over to Mr. Ley, who had been expressing his skepticism, and said quietly to him, "Willy, I like to show you something that'll make you change your mind." I did not do that, but I would like to show you the heading and the signatures, and I would likes to read you two statements from the listeners.

I showed him the heading -- a very important center for the government's super-secret activities-- and I showed him the signatures -- all well-known physicists -- and I read this:

"After six years of analyzing the evidence submitted to us by the U.S. government, we have come to the unanimous conclusion that the objects known as flying saucers do not originate on this earth, and that they possess capabilities which bring them radically beyond the range of present-day aircraft."

- page 81 -

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. The text is:

Capabilities far beyond any earth-made crafts. We also believe that these flying saucers, as they are called, are operated by intelligent beings of an extremely high order. 

I spent the whole night taking all the wind out of the sails of the debate, not contesting the matter at all, but asking questions of Major General who moderated the show. He kept trying to needle Mr. Ley to try and stir up a little argument.

I appeared on a film show with him about six months ago, in which I very carefully selected around the edges of the subject. I think he was afraid I still had that letter in my pocket. 

Now here's an odd thing about that "Author Meets the Critics" broadcast. Although the program was on the national network, it was carried by just one station, WCBS in New York. The network didn't cancel the program to suggest, but for some reason, which was never explained it was just stations off every other station.

In the winter of 1949, I was broadcasting every night over the Mutual network from Indianapolis. One night in December, a package came in for one of the announcers. I opened it up and it was a rough copy of Collier's magazine, which was the one that had the story about flying saucers. My friend got the magazine in error, because he was really supposed to have been broadcasting that.

That was the first really good article I had ever read on the flying saucers. I have a very high regard for Major Keyhoe. He has done a wonderful job of research and reporting on this subject.

In January, 1950, I came to Washington. As you will remember, there were some great skepticism at that time. No one raised any objection, because when I went with the API, I had a specific understanding with Mr. Wilkins Eason. The president of the API, and it was very clear old gentlemen. He said, "We know how you operate, and we just want you to do the same kind of job on our organization that you did before, and we'll never interfere with you." As long as Mr. Green lived, that was the basis. It didn't bother me with observations that were just positions or earlier ones, as major saucer reports. But when the national story time comes, I was free to devote a little more attention to the subject. I might say that I thoroughly investigated this phenomenon, which amounted to nothing when I went into it, to the point where it was one of the main things that the nation's capital.

In the summer of 1952, I was in Washington when flying saucers began arriving the nation's capital. Now, prior to that, there had been a great deal of official secrecy. Of course, there had been some attempts to deceive you or "con you around," and convince you that all these people who saw UFOs were a little off base.

their rookers, or had spots on their apdeckatles -- you got a good deal of Bs material, ven about the sighting. I don't know the source of those other fellows who were level-headed and in positions of responsibility. 
You could go in and ask them questions, you could renerally look at the photographs, and if you asked about the promise that they had) probably you are see them. Of course, somebody might not be allowed to take them out, and they might ask vou not to say anything about it; also, because we weren't too successful, I didn't want to say or give any other indications that we made an investigation or anything like that. 
But after those remarkable aightings in July 1952, when those things cane in and startled National Airport, when they circled in White House and the Pentagon, and had on our radar screens as they picked up, I have a very definite memory. 
In my book I've itemized the kinds of things that were seen, but they were seen in quantity. Then all of a sudden there was nothing more about them. As I say, this was, in Washington, that made the newspapers one night, I think of July 25th. CA that day, General Samford's press conference in which he said these things were seen, but he didn't know what they were. Definately, I've read the report and I know that our airfields were on the alert 24 hours a day, and I put it on the air that same night. It's stated quite a bit in those newspapers that were among them -- called the White House and the Pentagon and urged that they respond to from as reported, when the creatures that controlled and operated them were probably in radio contact with the device and this is what "v" said they thought was happening, that we might be starting something that we couldn't finish. And on the morning of the 29th the White House called off the whole sirtair.
That night there was an alert all up and down the east coast. A gigantic object, about 60,000 feet, had come down from Canada. The jets were ready to go as soon as it got ven low enough, but they couldn't get up there that high. This thing whatever it was was tracked vith our radar and started over Virginia, and our jets were ready to take off if it ever got low enough for them to reach.
And immediately following these dramatic and rather alarming sightings over the national airport, the policy of the military and government which seems to have been a desire to continuously by the Air Force ever sinces was put into effect. I don't know whether you've found that in other reports that I've seen, but they definitely wanted to cover up these sightings which made so many headlines. GS of these things came over V'ashington and all around the Airports; they flew in formation un and down between National Airport and some of the other buildings. They were seen visually by quite a few people, and they were picked up on our radar screens. Reports came out of many other cities -- in fact, the first of September, 1952 by the Civil Aeronautics Authority -- Technical Development Report"

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document containing text describing various UFO-related incidents and investigations.

Transcribed text from the document:

This is a 29-Page booklet that we have been given the impression that the sightings that will be explained by radar of 5 or 6 per cent as the Air Technical Intelligence Center was disqualification of radar sightings and even the ground visual sightings was fabrication. The case I've just mentioned is briefly summarized in that booklet.

An interesting thing about that G.A.A. booklet -- it points out that one of the radar sightings could be explained pretty well if there were one or two small rain scintillation marks, and there were one or two very small and fast blips and pretty close to the horizon, and near the ground it could have explained the strong signal return from those radar mirrors. But then they go on and list more than a dozen cases of sightings and everyone who looks at those closely will discover that their theory breaks down completely. For at least half of them, there was no phenomenon of any kind, at all, whether rain scintillations or anything else that would explain those returns. But you have to go through them for yourself, because the authors keep quiet about it.

On this more recent thing, the Air Force put out a statement that there had been only 87 sightings reported so far this year. All the news services carried it. I knew it was a lie, because I had furnished them 12 sightings myself. I was getting a little tired of correcting the false statements of the public relations people. I got in touch with Col. John O'Mara of the Air Force Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson. Orbits, as many of you probably know, is a Springfield man, and he's very competent man, and he's told him he got in touch with us. Col. O'Mara said they'd been given the impression that there was very little activity dealing with the UFOs, though they like to change the name of the project from time to time so as to keep the public impression. In June, at first they told me all sightings were coming in, he replied. "This is the biggest year we've ever had." Evidently didn't know that his bosses in Washington had put out that statement saying only 87 sightings had been reported. I understand that Mr. O'Mara's statement that night created a bit of a rumpus over at the Pentagon.

Where your sightings, I mean your instruments, do a good job, and that's why we don't believe you any good in the long run to stir up the Air Force and some of the other department, as to governments as I found out I had done it over again I'd probably do the same thing, because I'm a little hard-headed about these things.

By this time George Meany had become the president of the AFL, and things were getting pretty tough where they had been. They called him an assistant, but I'd been in the news business for 32 years, and I recognize a censor when I see one. The program's sightings were growing, but I realized that I was going to the end of my string. I realized an assistant an order to me. Now that is exacting what I must do what the censor told me to say. Well, if the censor was going to write the program, I did't want any more part of it. So I asked them to fire me--and Mr. Meany issued two amazing statements. In one he said, "We were disillusioned with flying saucer mail, and we were not particularly interested in that." The other thing he said was that I was "too pro-labor." Well, perhaps compared to him, that was true. I'm an AFL member myself. I have been one for a great many years, and I believe in the principles of trade unionism, like my father and grandfather.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in the provided document. The text is a detailed description of a reported UFO incident that occurred in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The document appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report.

Here is the full text transcribed from the document:

But as to his being deluged with flying saucer mail, I can only say to you that it was one of the smallest deluges in history. I asked my audience one night after a lecture, and they told me they were swamped with the continuing stories and flying saucer sightings. Because it was becoming difficult, the wire service wouldn't carry them any more, and I thought they were just plain fagged, tired out, and just couldn't find deliverance. As it turns out, it was more than 1,400 pieces of AFL building, and my office received between 800 and 900 pieces, all having to do with the Hopkinsville thing. He said also that "we were not particularly interested in flying saucers." That's possibly true, because only about two monthly newspaper had run his special article on flying saucers which he wrote at the request of Mr. George Van Tassel.

Well, the truth is that flying saucers really had nothing at all to do with the Hopkinsville saga. They just provided a convenient peg on which Mr. Meany could hang his statements. I'm not certain as to why Mr. Meany was so anxious to get me out of the picture, and I have the facts as that's down in writing - maybe it's because I was right, maybe it is reprehensible will let you read the book and decide for yourself.

Actually, the fellow did as I favor. There were only three nighttime radio programs that were covering the story. Due to the fact that we were doing an unusual type of program, it happened to have one of the three. But 1 realize it was working 12 to 15 hours a day to get the job done. I had to have plenty of rest when I came home, while I was very displeased that we had to have such a rumpus when we came to the meeting or somewhere in the town on account of our research. I'm certainly a lot happier now doing my television show at WTVF. There was no strings attached.

Let me tell you now about a couple of the most important flying-saucer cases ...

THE HOPKINSVILLE CASE
The first is a very strange affair. That happened on August 21st, last year, near Hopkinsville, Kentucky. It made headlines in the newspapers out there, and the press wire was carrying just because they thought it was ridiculous. You may remember reading the wire story about "little green men" and the ordinary hillbilly people who had them calling upon them in the village.

In the middle of the night eleven people rushed from a farmhouse in the little village of Kelly, 8 miles north of Hopkinsville, to get police protection against strange creatures from a flying saucer, who had been besieging them for hours. Shortly after sunset, one of the men had seen a saucer come down in a field behind the house. Soon afterwards, strange creatures about three feet tall, with big heads and enormous glowing eyes, appeared around the house. It's long arms hung almost to the ground, and a metallic appearance, and glowed in the dark. When they saw this thing, the men opened fire on the creatures, but the bullets had no effect. The creatures kept coming up to the house, and the men kept shooting at them, apparently for over two hours. The terrified family piled into two cars and drove to the police station to ask for help.

raced to the Hopkinsville police station. The police cars in Fore*, and they
searched all round the house. there was nothing to be found. No blood, no bodies,
no indication of drinking. The police finally left as an hour after they had gone
the house. But the family was in a state of terror, and they said there was certainly
no evidence of drinking. The policewere back again, Mr nemiuR Johnston, I, me for some
time watched out at one window, and saw nothing unusual for several minutes. Before dawn, they had
more shots of some little, black-looking creatures. Several of this rods had run
off past the house of relatives, and some had disappeared in a cornfield across the road.

it was in Mt. Veron, Indiana, only about 50 miles away, when this story hit
the newspapers. The Evansville Courier-Post of August 22nd printed a detailed
account of this story, including statements made by the witnesses, based on the description
given by the Sutton family. They described them as "small, black-looking little creatures". Since a member of my
family was driving, I couldn't leave at this time, so they were thorns before I did.

And when I did get to Hopkinsville, I walked into a practical joke, which is
one of the things you have to watch out for when you're looking to investigate subs
ject like this - a couple were newspa perrnen I knew had once played a joke on very good
friends of mine on a good "hot story". They told me the story, and it sounded strange to
them, "but wait", told me, "we've lots of indications they're a hoax, a foolprints of
some of the creatures." IF I'd bought it, their cup would have bubbled over. As it
was it took me some time to catch on.

The funny thing about this is that the hoaers were telling an essentially
true story. Though I'm more skeptical, I find Don't Reily's story seems cretable to me. Their pleasure
was fe4f, but the Kelly had happened Nobody has ever been able to dispute the essential facts
able to contradict them.

Another thing that they told me was not true of the Kelly case, but it was
true, as we both know, of another outstanding saucer landing case, That of the
Keerons that happened on September 12,1952, couple of aluminum-wire salesmen had
some adventures, who had stopped for rest at a tourist court of Virginia. They saw
day a fellow came slong selling subscriptions to a magazine that is printed in
August. Shortly, and he was wound the neighborhood every questioning everybody
who had reported anything. The few people who ordered the aluminum-were or subscrip
scribed to the publication that he said never been issued. Later with no that the
ter of explanation at all. I leave to your imagination what agency was probably
behind these incidents.

Well, the Kelly case had its comic aspects - and part of the joke was on per
sonal contact with in recent months. This one was a tragedy.

On January 6th of this year, at Bedford, Indiana, about 50 miles south of In
diana polls, she had OED appeared, two Keltys were driving home from school. A couple they knew were
short time before, and then they were seen south of Bedford, there they were watch
ed by three or four hundred people. The farmees were calling each other back and
forth to "see the little men".

investigation, See C.S.I. Research Reports No. 1, published in August, 1955.

The image contains a photograph that shows two faint images or silhouettes in the center. The document describes these as being the impressions of an object observed in the sky over Old Greenwich, Connecticut. The text goes on to provide details about the photographic examination and analysis of the images, including descriptions of microscopic examinations. However, as there are no human faces visible in the image, I will simply describe the contents of the image without identifying any individuals.

AFOIN-4
Coast of the photographic slides describes two faint images in the center of the frame. This image was originally furnished to us about the description of an object observed in the sky over Old Greenwich, Connecticut. These appear to be part of the same material as the object itself.
AFOIN-4X2B
Photographic examination (GOX-2500) both the "negative" or what appear to be the outline or edges of the object proper were damaged by a defect or a film The traces of the damage do not appear to be closely related or integral part of the images themselves.
AFOIN-4X2C
Microscopic examination (GOX-2500) of the photographic slides indicates that the print was made from a "negative" or what appears to be a sillhouette of the object. The film on which the object was photographed indicates evidence to suggest certain chemical particles of abnormal emission grain. The emulsion on this film appears to be part of the same material as the object itself.
AFOIN-4X3
This is commonly referred to as a "trace" or chemical particles of abnormal emission grain. The small particles in this case are in the form of a "trace" or a "crumb" appearing in the photo terminating slightly below the center of the frame.
AFOIN-4X4
The appearance of the object, photographed is difficult to describe in detail, as nothing similar to it has been observed before. It appears to be the outlines of some complex form or configuration of material rather than a simple geometric shape.
AFOIN-4A
It should be noted that the appearance of the object, photographed is somewhat similar to some results obtained during certain experiments in photoflash photography where electrical discharges produce photographic effects.
AFOIN-4B
This spot or flare may have been caused from either a defect in the original film or through microscopic chemical deposits contained during the processing of the color film.
AFOIN-4C
No attempt is made to correlate the data submitted in the UFO report with the film or photograph. In this report there is certain inconsistencies in the report submitted to us.
AFOIN-4D
These measurements indicate that the fastest shutter speed involved in UFO reports with films or photography is approximately 1/1000 second, which would be highly improbable that a visual observation would be recorded as a distinct image on the film.
AFOIN-4E
The transparency indicates that the object is almost certainly due to some defect, scratch, or flaw on the film which would appear that it would be very difficult to determine the validity of the photographic object in the frame.

forth on the fence wires, and when anybody picked up the phone everybody else was listening in on the conversation. Somebody saud. What was follus a the usual patter - disc-shaped, about 25 feet in diameter, glowing and changing color from a filw:. ve11ow to reddish. They sent jeta from Louisville up to chase them, but as soon as the jets got within 15 or 20 miles the jets were off. The incident took on a highly unusual and dangerous character. It occurred at great altitude in a matter of seconds. 
There were several letters, between May 31 and June 3, I got a call from our Bloomington studio. They said, "We've got a picture for you of the wreckage of a National Guard crashed ground controlled intercept plane this afternoon between Bloomington and Bedford." The pilot was killed. It turned out that the pilot was following a routine flight to Conway, Gulf, he was low on fuel, and a wonderful guy.
The following day I discovered, through a friend of mine in Louisville, that the jets had been up again after unidentified objects south of Bloomington, just as on the 5th, and again the jets had lost them. But Col. Norken, who was in charge of the National Guard air base down at Louisville, had taken off in a P-51 Mustang. A propeller-driven job. He had gone up white, and the pilots said he was in excellent condition. He had gone up because he could fly longer than the jets. And the jets were flying in formation back of him, attempting to direct him to the objects. Finally he reported back that he could see the edge of a cloud some distance ahead of him and above him, and he took after it. According to his discription, when he got to climind it, it was following it. He gave no description of it, other than to say that he could see whatever it was gaining a little on it, and it was then below him, and he was going to move on it. I don't recall receiving any further details on that flight.
It never made the papers. On November 11, 1954, an unknown object had appeared in the very same area and Col. Norken had instantiated the plane of which mention was made in my earlier on a similar mission, not the paper mentioned that he had been chasing something when his plane mysteriously crashed.

Mr. Edwards' talk was followed by a discussion period, in which he answered questions from the audience. Nearly all of these questions and answers, in a somewhat condensed form, are given below.

Q - Is there any evidence that any of these objects have crashed?
A - I'm not too sure that some of them haven't. Way back in 1947, at Roswell.

New Mexico, a farmer reported that he saw something strike a mountainside and caused a disturbance to what it was doing' suddenly'became visible in a circle all around that place, and would let nobody in for five days. Finally they came up with a platform made with aluminum foil on a little' radar target-- and they said this was it-- believe it or not. There have been many others like I don't know whether there's any truth in them.

Q - Why don't they grab more often these they are seen so frequently?

A - Dr. Hermann Oberth, the father of the German Rocket Society, and certainly one of the world's great rocket scientists, said one day last year, "I am confident that they operate by distorting the gravitational field." Nine days later Dr. Oberth made the front pages nationwide, and I shall remember what he said about not wanting to make any public statements. But I've had other physicists tell me the same thing. If that proves to be correct, then it would be impossible for them to be subjects to the law of gravity. Of course, they might still collide with something. I have a feeling that that has probably happened sometimes, but I've never come across those things you certainly wouldn't find us finding out.

Q - Why doesn't the government want people to know about this?

A - I suspect they're afraid of hysteria. There was an example of that, you know, in that 1938 broadcast of Orson Welles. I'll have to admit that I was one of those who was so gullible to believe that that thing was invading New Jersey and St. Louis, and everything else. And I jumped up and I grabbed the phone and I called WHAS, and fortunately I got hold of an engineer, and he said, "Don't worry, and this is just a dramatic re-enactment of Wells's 'War of the Worlds'," and we're catching you know what about it!

Q - How is the government able to keep saucer sightings quiet?

A - There are only these press services, and they are still dependent on the Pentagon and other government agencies for their big stories. So it's very easy to bribe them into silence -- or "swill their co-operation". Anyone who gets out of line won't get any more scoops.

Q - Have there been sightings in Europe?

A - Yes, that's true, the sightings in Europe have been more numerous than those in this country. In October 1954, for example, the sightings in France, Italy, and Spain reached a point that almost had to mass panic. People were reporting little green men by the hundreds.

Q - Are the European governments also keeping their investigations secret?

A - They definitely are. In fact, the British Government announced a year ago that it would not make any public statement on the findings of its investigations, and on the same day it issued orders to all military personnel not to discuss the subject and not to make public any reports.

Q - Are these nations co-operating with the United States?
A - I think some of them are co-operating rather closely. I think that Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and Germany, and perhaps Italy and France, are working very closely with our own government. What the others are doing I don't know.

Q - Do you have any idea whether the Russians are starting to break the news to their people?
A - No, I haven't heard anything that would indicate that. But I'm inclined to think that the U.S. government may be starting to break it, because the Air Force has had some releases to members of the press by direction of the Secretary of the Air Force, an 30 March 1953. Both of these indicate that they are contemplating doing this fairly soon.

Q - Could the saucers be using Antarctica as a base?
A - I think it's quite possible that part of our government's present interest in the Antarctica is due to this. Commander Dufek of the Chilean Navy made thousands of feet of movies of UFOs circling around in the low altitude - much as in the Tremonton film - down in the Antarctica. And these things are often seen traveling North and South up and down the west coast of South America. There must be some reason why so much activity could be found down in that area.

Q - Has just one type of space man been discovered so far?
A - Well, I can't give you certain knowledge of what's been discovered; but I will say this: descriptions of these creatures by credible witnesses generally fall into one or two main categories, as reported, for example, from Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas, and Georgia. The other is a sort of microscopic monster like the one reportedly seen at Sutton, West Virginia and a couple of other places. Last Fall, while on a plane, the captain noticed one of these small humanoid creatures passing by the window. I got to see these - some of some of the small humanoid creatures. They had injured some people, principally constables, who had encountered them. These little fellows, evidently, are able to take care of themselves.

Q - Did the Hopkinsville creatures display any hostility? Did they return the humans' fire--did they reciprocate or anything like that?
A - No, they did not. They carried no weapons or other artificial implements. Or, none were seen. One occasion, when one of the men put his head out of the window, one of the creatures snatched it, but they did seem to use those aggressive measures. Several of them were shot at down with its claws and, and grasped his hair.

Transcribed text from the document:

A - I have in my possession a set of prints which Mr. Adamski sent me about three years ago. And having been a photographer for 30 years it didn't take me more than 30 minutes to see that these pictures were not exactly what he claimed they guided.
Q - Do you judge Adamski entirely by his photographs?
A - No, I've read his books. I wouldn't, as a newspaperman, report the things that he reports without having some evidence other than he's able to supply. And I regard his pictures as being on a par with his prose.
Q - What is your opinion on the experiences of Daniel Fry, Truman Bethurum, and Orfeo Angelucci? Do you believe them?
A - I wouldn't want to stand up here and say I don't believe the gentlemen. Would say this, if they can establish in a scientific way something that has never been established before, then their statement at the present time I would be inclined to consider their stories as slightly incredible at least from a reporter's standpoint.
Q - Why don't the saucers land openly?
A - If we're going to another planet, and I think we're doing that, that we'll never know people, somehow - and we found it to be inhabited by people - and these saucers are reported as doing the same thing, they could do just exactly what the people here, the natives, say we would do it in an extremely isolated place. We would then draw them out to see how fast they could fly away, and how high and so forth, and take the next step. The thing, though, that maybe we're reconsidering, it's something that we ought to policy. That policy might not be the same as the policy they ought to have.
Q - During the years that you have been studying flying saucer reports, have you noticed any changes in their reported appearance or behavior?
A - Yes, there's one thing I think has changed since 1947. As man develops more and as technology improves, the sightings are becoming more frequent. But it's in the pattern of lights on them, but after that, to the best of my knowledge, they have all been witnessed pretty much the same. That is, the pilots seem to be able to see them and avoid collisions. Whether that's intentional or not I don't know, but it looks like an intentional maneuvering and that's the thing that has changed has been the manner in which the government has treated the subject with increased secrecy as the years go by.
Q - Might the frequency of sightings since 1947 have something to do with atomic explosions?
A - Yes, I feel that there may be some significance in that; perhaps somebody saw these blast flashes and came in to see what was going on. We think we're accomplishing something similar on Mars and we'd like to know what's going on there.
A - Will the rockets the U.S. is testing now be the answer to space travel?

There does not appear to be a photograph in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions and answers.

Transcription of the text in the document:

A - Those compare to a real spaceship the way a canoe compares to the Queen Mary. We're just paddling in the shallows of space with these things. It's a beginning, but it's still quite much more.

Q - Did Dr. Slipher ever make public his last Martian investigation?
A - Yes, he did. He said that in his opinion there can be no doubt but that there is life on Mars. He seems to go so far as to say intelligent life, but of course he couldn't go that far. His article appeared in the National Geographic magazine which shows very good pictures of Mars, which they have showed, but unfortunately was built down there by Morris Jessup, who wrote The Case for the UFO.

Q - Can you tell us something about the bridge on the moon, said to be made of metal?
A - Percy Wilkins' book "Mysteries of Space and Time," published in England last year, said that on the moon there are constructed bridges, one of which is several miles long, and some other astronomers say that they have been photographed and that some thing has definitely been found on the moon, which is unexplained at the present time, is a number of what seem to be themselves intelligently built. Only they must be gigantic. The last I heard on the subject they had located about 200 of these things which they never saw built, and nobody knows what they are.

Q - Those satellites that are known are beginning to circle the earth surely can't be natural, because they are so close. Do you think they were put there by beings from some other planet?
A - I think that's quite possible; and don't forget that Adler Planetarium reported last year that an astronomer to whom they gave their endorsement had located more than 100 satellites which were circling the earth at an altitude higher than any man-made satellite. So this is quite a thing.

Q - Has the disappearance of six planes over the Caribbean, as described in Keyhoe's "Flying Saucer Conspiracy," ever been explained?
A - No, it has not. In fact, over 200 planes have disappeared in a large oval-shaped area in the Atlantic. And a number of aircraft and surface ships that were equipped with radar have flown over this area and found nothing. I have no idea what happened to them.

Q - Has there been anything more on the Kimross plane-disappearance case?
A - No, all I know about that is what Major Keyhoe and I were able to find out about the time he was writing his book.

Q - Do you have any opinion on the so-called "skyquakes"? The usual thing is that they're blamed on jets breaking the sound barrier, but that there were no jets in the air at the time. Do you think they're connected with flying saucers?
A - I don't know what the answer is to that, but it's going on all over the world. It's some kind of a terrific concussion at high altitudes. Incidentally, even if just before this it happened they're under strict orders not to go through the sound barrier.

- page 92 -

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing text.

Q - How long do you think it'll be before we find out definitely where the saucers come from?
A - I think that this year we may find out more about these things than we ever before, because its possible to judge that the frequency of saucer sightings is greatest in the years when we are closest to the planet Mars. And September 7th of this year, when we're closer to Mars than we've been in many years. The 90 days after that will be a very significant period.

Q - How long do you think it'll be before we find out definitely where the saucers come from?
A - I think that this year we may find out more about these things than we ever before, because its possible to judge that the frequency of saucer sightings is greatest in the years when we are closest to the planet Mars. And September 7th of this year, when we're closer to Mars than we've been in many years. The 90 days after that will be a very significant period.

You know, they might decide that we're so stupid and so far beneath them
that we're hopeless, and that we aren't worth all the trouble that we might
cause them.
Q - But would they just go away and act as if we never existed? 
A - I can give you a comparable situation. Suppose you had a big plane over the jungle, and you saw a bunch of savages down there beating each other's brains out with clubs. You might circle around and watch them do it, but you really wouldn't have any ambition to land and join in. And that may be the position we have reached in culture, as compared with some of these civilizations that send us flying saucers.

THE CASE:
THIS REPORT REACHED HEADQUARTERS AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY GROUND RADAR IF IT HAD OCCURRED. HOWEVER, CHECKS WITH RADAR STATIONS REVEALED NOTHING. THIS CASE REMAINED UNSOLVED.

THIS INCIDENT WAS OBSERVED BY A FISHERMAN NAMED WALTER C. NUDD, HIS WIFE AND THREE FRIENDS WHILE FISHING FROM THE SHORE ALONG THE COAST OF CONNECTICUT NEAR OLD GREENWICH ON APRIL 10, 1955.

WHILE FISHING, NUDD AND HIS PARTY OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY AROUND 8:50 P.M. APPARENTLY HOVERING OR STATIONARY. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 2 FEET IN DIAMETER.

WHEN FIRST OBSERVED, THE LIGHT WAS ABOUT 30 TO 40 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT THEN SUDDENLY MOVED RAPIDLY TO THE EAST AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 600-800 MILES PER HOUR. AFTER TRAVELING ABOUT 10 DEGREES IN AZIMUTH, IT STOPPED SUDDENLY AND HOVERED FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES. IT THEN MOVED BACK ALONG THE SAME PATH AT THE SAME SPEED, STOPPED AGAIN, AND FINALLY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

THE SIGHTING LASTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES. NUDD AND HIS PARTY WERE ADAMANT THAT WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT, METEOR, OR ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AERIAL OBJECT.

TALLH CLAIMS TO HAVE OBSERVED UFO ON AUGUST 6, 1955 AT ABOUT 12:15 AM IN OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT. UFO APPEARED OVAL SHAPED, GIVING OFF BRIGHT BLUE-GREEN LIGHT, AND MOVED ACROSS SKY AT GREAT SPEED AND ALTITUDE. TALLH CLAIMS OBJECT SEEMED TO SHAPE TO BE SLIGHTLY CONCAVE ON BOTTOM.

LABOR OVERCODE: WITH WITNESS FULL DETAILS OF SIGHTING
FULL DETAILS OF SIGHTING AS FOLLOWS:
TALLH...SAW OBJECT OVER GREENWICH, CONN. ON AUGUST 6, 1955 ABOUT 12:15 AM. OBJECT APPEARED OVAL SHAPED, GIVING OFF BRIGHT BLUE-GREEN LIGHT, AND MOVED ACROSS SKY AT GREAT SPEED AND ALTITUDE. OBJECT SEEMED TO BE SLIGHTLY CONCAVE ON BOTTOM.

NOTES
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IT TALLH CLAIMS TO HAVE OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR ONLY A VERY SHORT TIME AS IT PASSED VERY RAPIDLY AND HIGH OVERHEAD. HE WAS ABLE TO SEE IT WELL ENOUGH TO OBSERVE THAT IT WAS OVAL SHAPED AND GAVE OFF A BRIGHT BLUE-GREEN LIGHT. HE STATED THAT HE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT WHAT HE SAW, AND WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECT. IT APPEARED TO BE VERY LARGE AND HIGH, MOVING AT GREAT SPEED.

NOTES
IN THE EVENT OF SIMILAR TYPE SIGHTINGS, WITNESS DETAILS ARE ADDED AS IN EACH CASE DESCRIBED ABOVE.
IT WOULD BE WELL IF OVER-RUNS COULD BE AVOIDED HOWEVER, THE INDIVIDUAL'S CREDIBILITY AND RELIABILITY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY OFFICER HANDLING CASE.

THIS IS THE STORY OF MY CONNECTION WITH THE "SPACE SHIP" THAT DESCENDED ON THE VIRGINIA GRAHAM FARM...LOCATED ABOUT SIX MILES FROM THE TOWN IN WHICH I LIVE...HOPKINSVILLE, KY. ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING THAT YOU READ FROM HERE ON IS SECOND HAND...HOWEVER IT'S THE BEST INFORMATION THAT I COULD OBTAIN IN THE WORLD...IT COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE L.PS OF THE SEVEN ADULTS INVOLVED. THESE SAME SEVEN THAT I REFER TO...LIVED THROUGH A VERY HARROWING NIGHT...AND FROM WHAT I CAN DETERMINE...A NIGHT THAT THEY WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE REPEATED. TO THE BEST OF EVERYBODY'S KNOWLEDGE...IT STARTED AROUND SEVEN-THIRTY OR EIGHT-O'CLOCK ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT OF AUGUST 21, 1955.

I WAS A VISITOR TO THE GRAHAM HOUSEHOLD WHOM CHARLESTOS A. WEST VIRGINIA, GRANGER WATER FROM A WELL IN THE REAR OF THE ONE STORY BUILDING. AS HE WAS BRINGING THE BUCKET UP, HE SAW A RED OBJECT IN THE SKY TRAILING AN EXHAUST WHICH HAD ALL THE COLORS IN THE RAINBOW. THE OBJECT CAME FROM THE WEST...PASSED ACROSS THE RESIDENCE, AND PROCEEDED DOWN INTO THE FIELD BEHIND THE SUTTON HOUSEHOLD. IT SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN...COME TO A HALT, AND DROPPED VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND DISAPPEARING WITH A SOUND LIKE "POOF" OF THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE HAS A GULLY ABOUT 200 YARDS DEEP WHEN A WALLS AWAY TO THE BOTTOM OF A GULLY ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE HOUSE. THE OBJECT DROPPED BEHIND THIS RISE WHEN IT LANDED, AND TO THIS DATE THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE OR TRACE OF IT'S EXACT POSITION. IN THAT GENERAL DIRECTION...THE FIELD IS BOUNDED ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT WITH TREES...AND I MADE AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH INTO TO THE WOODS ON BOTH SIDES...PENETRATING PER ABOUT 50 YARDS...BUT FOUND NOTHING. THE FIELD WAS SEARCHED COMPLETELY ALSO...,HOWEVER ANY SORT OF IMPRESSION IN FLAT CLAY-LIKE GROUND WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE...AS THE WEATHER HAD BEEN HOT AND RAINLESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

Here is the full text transcribed from the image:

BOT BACK TO THE STORY.....X WAS TRANSFERRED BY WHAT HE HAD SEEN....A TER IT LANDED....HE R.N INTO THE HOUSE AND RELATED TO THE REST WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED. NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIM....AND AFTER TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE...THE WHOLE FAMILY PASSED IT OFF AS BEING FUNNY. ABOUT ONE HOUR LATER.....HOWEVER, THE SMILES DROPPED OFF THEIR FACES. AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE INCIDENT. 
IN THE REAR OF THE HOUSE, INSIDE, AND UNDER THE STAIRS, APPEARED A SMALL MAN....ONLY THREE AND ONE HALF FEET TALL, HAD AN EXTREMELY OVERSIZED HEAD WHICH WAS ALMOST PERFECTLY ROUND, AND THE ARMS EXTENDED TO THE GROUND WITH LARGE. OUT OF SIZE HANDS, WHICH HAD TALONS ON THE ENDS OF ITS FINGERS. THE EYES WERE SAUER LIKE...MUCH BIGGER THAN A HUMAN'S.....AND GLOWED A YELLOWISH COLOR. THE BODY WAS SLIGHTLY MADE OF SILVER JELLY AND GAVE OFF AN EERIE LIGHT TO THE LIGHT GIVEN OUT BY IT. 
AT HIS HABITUAL DIAL WATCH, HIS HANDS WERE RAISED, AS HE PEACHED THE HOUSE. AS THE SOMEONE TOLD HIM HE WAS ABOUT TO BE RECORDED....HE MOVED SLOWLY TOWARD THE BACK DOOR. ARMED THEMSELVES....A SHOTGUN FOR ....AND A ..22 RIFLE FOR....WITHDRAWING INTO THE HOUSE SLIGHTLY...THEY AWAITED THE ARRIVAL OF THE CREATURE. IT MOVED TO WITHIN 20 FEET OF THE BACK DOOR AND BOTH MEN FIRED...NOT ONE PELLET OR BULLET SEEMED TO STRIKE IT...IT SCURRIED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS. THEY WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES...THEN WENT IN. 
THE FRONT ROOM WHERE THE CREATURE NO LONGER WAS. AT THE SIDE WINDOW ANOTHER ONE APPEARED....AND THIS TIME AT POINT BLANK RANGE THEY FIRED THROUGH THE WINDOW. AGAIN IT DID A FLIP AND DISAPPEARED. THIS TIME THE MEN DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE AND SEE IF IT WAS HIT. AS THEY STEPPED OUTSIDE, ANOTHER ONE APPEARED BEHIND THEM AND THEY QUICKLY WENT BACK INSIDE.

Text extracted from the document:

A CIAM-LIKE HAND REACHED DOWN FROM THE OVERHEAD THAT SEEMED TO SHIELD THE FRONT DOOR FROM RAIN. SEVERAL INSIDE THE BUILDING SAW THE REACHING HAND AND SCREAMED TO ___ DARTING OUTSIDE...
TURNED THE SHOTGUN UP TO THE ONE SIDE...FIRED...AND KNOCKED HIM OVER THE ROOF. APPARENTLY IT DIDN'T HARM IT HOWEVER... AS IT FLOATED TO THE OTHER SIDE...LANDING ON THE GROUND WITHOUT A NOISE.
IT THEN SCURRIED OFF INTO THE UNDERGROWTH. SEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE OUT MUCH COURAGE AND THEY DISCOVERED ANOTHER ONE A LITTLE FURTHER UP IN THE TREES...AND ONE A FEARED FROM AROUND THE CORNER RIGHT IN FRONT OF __. HE BROUGHT THE SHOTGUN TO BEAR ON THE LITTLE FELLOW...AND FIRED AT POINT BLANK RANGE...AND WHEN STOOD IN AMAZEMENT AS IT PLIED OVER...
GOT UP...AND RAN AWAY WITHOUT SEEMINGLY BEING HURT. WHEN A DIRECT BLAST FROM A TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN DIDN'T SEEM TO AFFECT THE CREATURES...THEY DECIDED THE OBVIOUS...THEY'LL LEAVE THEM ALONE.
THEY ALL RETIRED TO THEIR HOUSES...AND THEY DECIDED TO FEAR WHAT NEXT TO DO. 
THE OBJECTS WOULD APPEAR AT A WINDOW OR DOORWAY...THE FAMILY WOULD FIRE...AND THE OBJECTS WOULD MESSENLY RUN FOR COVER.
SOMEONE THEN DISCOVERED THEY WERE ADVERSE TO LIGHT...THERE EYES YOU'LL REMEMBER WERE LARGE...AND APPARENTLY EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT. SO THEY TURNED ON THE FRONT _______ LIGHT...WHICH SEEMED TO STOP THEM FROM ADVANCING FROM THAT DIRECTION.
AFTER THREE HOURS OF THIS...THE FAMILY DECIDED TO GO AFTER HELP. IT HAD NO PHONE IN THE HOUSE. THE FAMILY GOT INTO THE CAR...AND SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVED AT THE HOPKINSVILLE POLICE STATION. AFTER RELAYING THEIR TALE TO POLICE...A WHOLE POSSE OF HOPKINSVILLE POLICE, STATE TROOPERS, AND SHERIFF'S OFFICERS DESCENDED UPON THE SCENE. THEY FOUND NOTHING. HERE, HOWEVER, WE MIGHT CONJECTURE A BIT...THE OBJECTS DID NOT LIKE LIGHT, AND WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT

THE HOUSE WAS LIT UP LIKE A ROMAN CANDLE. LOCAL AND STATE OFFICERS STAYED ON THE SCENE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS...AND DID NOT SEE ANYTHING ELSE OF THE CURIOUS PHENOMENON. POLICE SAID IT APPEARS HOW SOMETHING WAS AMISS...AS THE FAMILY WERE TO POSITIVE THEY HAD SEEN SOMETHING, AND WERE VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED. 
THE POLICE LEFT AROUND ONE O'CLOCK, AND THE FAMILY TRIED TO SETTLE DOWN FOR THE NIGHT. THE ELDEST OF THE GROUP, A MRS.     , WAS RESTING IN HER BED SITUATED NEAR THE     WINDOW. AGAIN...ALL THE LIGHTS WERE OFF...AND SHE BECAME AWARE OF SOMETHING GLOWING IN THE WINDOW. SHE LOOKED...AND SAW THE ENTIRE WATCHING THEIR HANDS WERE LIT IN FAIRY FASHION WITH THE LIGHT. IT IS SAID THAT NO MOTION. MRS.     CALLED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW...SHOOK HER HEAD IN DISBELIEF, AND TURNED AGAIN TO THE OPENING. NOTHING HAD CHANGED...AND ONCE AGAIN SHE TURNED HER HEAD AWAY AND BLINKED HER EYES. AGAIN THE SAME SIGHT WAS THERE TO SEE WHEN SHE LOOKED. SHE SOFTLY CALLED TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY TO COME AND LOOK. THIS SHOTGUN WAS AGAIN BROUGHT TO PLAY ON THE LIGHT, MAN FROM THIS PORCH, HAVING BASCULE AS BEFORE SECONDS AS BEFORE THIS OBJECT DISAPPEARED. WE MIGHT CONJECTURE AGAIN WERE THIS WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT THEIR SENSITIVE EYES. THE HOUSEHOLD, NEEDLESS TO SAY, DIDN'T SLEEP THE ENTIRE NIGHT, AND SHORTLY AFTER DAY BREAK...THE GROUNDS WERE CRAWLING WITH THE CURIOUS. THE FOREGOING IS THE NEAREST THING TO CHRONOLOGICAL HAPPENINGS OF THAT NIGHT, PIECED TOGETHER FROM THE INTERVIEWS I HAD WITH EACH OF THE SEVEN ADULTS INVOLVED.

Transcription of text:

"I ROSE LATE THAT PARTICULAR MONDAY MORNING...AS IT WAS MY DAY OFF FROM WORK. BEING AN AMATEUR RADIO OPERATOR, I DECIDED TO WORK ON MY RADIO UHF JUST FOR THIS...I DECIDED I WOULD NOT EVEN RAISE AN AERIE TO GO OUTSIDE THE OBSERVATIVE I DID. I RAN INTO A TOUGH PROBLEM, AND DECIDED TO SEEK THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CHIEF ENGINEER AT THE RADIO STATION WHERE I WORK. AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK I WANDERED INTO THE STATION, AND WAS GREETED BY VARIOUS COMMENTS...ALL CENTERING AROUND 'HAVE YOU SEEN THE LITTLE GREEN MEN YET'. INQUIRING INTO THE SITUATION, I RECEIVED A VAGUE REPORT OF THE NIGHT'S HAPPENINGS. REMEMBERING A RECENT ARTICLE ON POLICE ARTISTS RECONSTRUCTION OF FACIAL FEATURES...I DECIDED TO SEE IF I COULDN'T DO THE SAME. IN PREPARING TO SKETCH, I HAD STUDIED AND PAINTING, SO I RESOLVED TO SEE IF I COULDN'T CLARIFY THE SITUATION. TAKING ONE OF THE AVAILABLE PERSONS THERE AT THE STATION, WE WENT OUT FOR THE HOUSE, FULLY EQUIPPED WITH PENCILS AND LOADS OF PAPER. AS WE DROVE UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING, MRS. [REDACTED] WAS SITTING IN A CHAIR OUT ON THE LAWN. AFTER INTRODUCTIONS, SHE AGREED WITH THE OVER TWO LADIES AT HOME TO SIT DOWN WITH ME, AND SEE WHAT WE COULD DRAW. AT THIS POINT I WAS TO INDICATE THAT I HAD NOT LEAD THESE PEOPLE AS THEY WERE EXTREMELY POSITIVE OF WHAT THEY SAW...OR DIDN'T SEE...AND IT WAS MORE OF A MATTER OF ME FOLLOWING THEIR DIRECTIONS IN THE SHAPE OF THE FACE EYES, HANDS AND BODY. IF IT WOULD EVEN SEE MUCH AS ADVANCE A SUGGESTION OF HOW ONE PARTICULAR FEATURE LOOKED...THEY WOULD QUICKLY CORRECT ME. AND SO WE SAT...DRAWING SKETCH AFTER SKETCH. AT FIRST I HAD DRAWN A LARGE FACE AS THEY DIRECTED...HOWEVER AS WE PROGRESSED RATHER OBVIOUS THE WHOLE BODY WOULD NOT FIT ON THE PAPER. SO WE STARTED AGAIN..."

- page 102 -

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text describes an apparent UFO sighting, providing details about the object's appearance and the witnesses' experiences.

The text states that the object had "eyes like saucers, large, and set about 3 to 4 inches apart" and that "they seemed to be small men or midgets around the side of the face". It mentions that the object "seemed to be pointed at the top" and that the witnesses "progressed to the body" but could not determine if it was a neck or not. The text also describes the witnesses' reactions and their subsequent agreement that there was no neck.

IT WASN'T TOO LONG BEFORE THE APPARITION BEGAN TO TAKE FORM....
THE EYES LIKE SAUCERS, LARGE, AND SET ABOUT 3 TO 4 INCHES APART. THEY 
SEEMED TO BE SMALL MEN OR MIDGETS AROUND THE SIDE OF THE FACE. THE HANDS...FLABBY, 
LIKE A PIECE OF LEATHER....THEY SEEMED TO BE POINTED AT THE TOP...
AND THEY WERE TOO BIG.....(THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS DESCRIBED). THE HEAD
SEEMED TO BE CIRCULAR...COMPLETELY BALD ON TOP...AND THE FEATURES, 
SUCH AS THE EYES AND EARS WERE NOT PLACE ON THE HEAD AS WE MIGHT 
EXPECT THEM TO BE. WE PROGRESSED TO THE BODY....NO ONE WAS SURE 
WHETHER THERE WAS A NECK OR NOT...SO WE LEFT IT OUT. (LATER...
WHEN THE THREE MEN CAME BACK FROM INDIANA, THEY ALL AGREED THAT
THERE WAS NO NECK)(THIS EYE THE WAS WAS NOT ASKED FOR EITHER...IT
WAS A VOLUNTARY ADMISSION BY ALL THREE IN THEIR DESCRIPTION). THE 
BODY, ACCORDING TO THE WITNESSES, WAS QUITE BIG AND SPLENDIDLY MADE AND
LEGS AND A FORMLESS STICKING WOULD SEEM TO BE KICKING. 
THEY WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LONG AS THE LEGS, AND ALMOST TOUCHED THE
GROUND WHERE THE FEET WOULD BE. THE HANDS WERE HUGE, FULLY LOOKING
TWICE, WITH TALONS THAT CURLED...SEVERAL INCHES LONG...IN PLACE OF
FINGERNAILS. AFTER THE BASIC FORM WAS SKETCHED, AND THE HEAD ASKED
TO THE TOP OF IT, MENTIONED THAT IT WAS SO LIKE THE
APPARITION SHE SAW....SHE WAS NOT GOING TO LOOK AT IT ANY LONGER...
AND IT SEEMED TO GO OVERHEAD....WILL REMEMBER...IF EVER ANYONE
BRINGS STAYED ON INSIDE TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE
DRAWING. THE ONLY PART OF THE FACE THAT NO ONE COULD DESCRIBE WAS
THE NOSE....MAINLY BECAUSE THEY ALL AGREED THE HUGE EYES WERE
TREMENDOUSLY FASCINATING, AND DREW THEIR ATTENTION TO THAT RATHER
THAN OTHER FEATURES. I ATTEMPTED TO SKETCH A NOSE IN, THEY SEEMED TO AGREE
IT MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE, BUT NONE WERE SURE...SO WE REMOVED IT.

Text transcribed from the document:

WHEN THE INTERVIEWED THE MEN LATER, JUST ONE OF THE FOUR WHO (CENSORED) REPORTED A U.C.S., AND HE DIDN'T SEEM TO SURE ABOUT IT) (THIS WAS MERELY CASUALLY STATED THERE WAS NO FUSS...SO..HE LEFT IT OUT) AFTER COMPLETING THE DRAWING...HE TOOK IT OUTSIDE TO SHOW MRS. (CENSORED) WHO TOOK ONE LOOK, DECIDED WE SHOULDN'T BOTHER MESSING IT AGAIN..AND ASKED HIM TO TAKE IT AWAY...SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT ANYMORE. WE SPENT THREE HOURS AT THE (CENSORED) HOUSEHOLD THAT MORNING AND AFTERNOON, AND ASKED IF WE COULDN'T COME BACK THAT EVENING WHEN THE MEN WOULD ARRIVE FROM EVANSVILLE INDIANA. THREE OF THE MEN, (CENSORED), AND TWO OTHERS HAD GONE THEIR SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST TO GET A TRUCK REPAIRED. THE WOMEN AGREED WE COULD COME BACK THAT EVENING.
I TOLD HIM SO DARN HARD TO GET THE SKETCH THAT IT ALMOST HURT MY MIND...I SAT DOWN TO REDRAW THE SKETCH, AS HE RATHER BRUSQUELY SAID WAS THE RATHER POOREST DRAWING BOARD I'D EVER WORKED ON. TRACING THE BASIC SKETCH SO AS NOT TO LOSE THE PROPORTIONS, I SMOOTHED UP THE ROUGH SPOTS, AND SHADED THE DRAWING TO GIVE MORE EMPHASIS TO THE FACIAL AND BODY FEATURES. IT WAS THIS DRAWING THAT I TOOK BACK WITH ME THAT EVENING AROUND 7:30. AFTERAGAIN CHECKING IT SIDE-SIDE COMPARISON, I HAD PROCEEDED IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY...AND PROCEEDED IN ARRIVAL BY AN HOUR. I VERY QUIETLY LAYED DOWN THE DRAWING ON THE BED BESIDE WHERE I WAS STANDING, AND THEN MOVED AWAY. (CENSORED) CAME INTO THE ROOM, GLANCED AT THE BED...SAW THE DRAWING...HELD IT AND PICKED IT UP...AND GAVE US ALL THE COLD CHILLS BY DECLARING "THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT, IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IT"... (LATER HOWEVER, HE HAD A LOT TO ADD TO IT, HE SAID THAT NO ONE ELSE SEEMED TO HAVE SEEN).

I ASKED HIM THEN INTO THE NEXT ROOM....AND BY OURSELVES HE STARTED 
TO DRAW PICTURE NUMBER TWO...USING THE FIRST AS A BASIS. AGAIN, I 
DID NOT PROMPT HIM, BUT LET HIM LEAD ME IN THE DRAWING. THE CORRECTIONS 
WERE MINOR...(HE EXPERIMENTED WITH EARPHONES AND ANTENNAE'S PROTRUDING FROM THE HEAD. WAS VERY POSITIVE ABOUT A MUSCULAR BODY, AND EVEN THOUGH HE WASN'T AN ARTIST, ATTEMPTED TO DRAW IN SEVERAL FEATURES HE HAD ME SAW...MY OBSERVATIONS: I BELIEVE HE HAS ELABORATING CONSIDERABLY.) HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS SURE HE HAD SEEN A NOSE, BUT COULD NOT HIS OBSERVATION SAY...AFTER THE SECOND DRAWING WAS COMPLETED...WE SITE FED OUTSIDE FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR...NO AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE LAST THREE LITTLE MEN TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE NIGHT BEFORE. WE HAD ONLY BEEN OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE...WHEN A THUNDERSHOWER DOUSED EVERYONE WHO COULDN'T FIND SHELTER. WE WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WE MIGHT REMIND YOU AT THIS POINT THAT THE FAMILY HAD NOW BEEN UP FOR MORE THAN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS...AND IT WAS BRINGING TO SHOW. THEY SEEMED TO BE EXHAUSTED. IN PARTICULAR WAS UNHAPPY, AND WENT TO THE DOOR SEVERAL TIMES TO ASK THE LIGHTSEER'S TO PLEASE GO AWAY. THE SHOWER, AS HE SAID, DID END ALL CUIRTING FOR THEIR CARS, BUT IT WAS SHORT-LIVED...AND THEY CAME RIGHT BACK. THIS WAS THE SCENE AND TEMPO OF THE PEOPLE WHEN RECORDED AT 8:30. HE'S WELL BUILT, STRONG, HAS DARK BLACK HAIR, AND WASN'T AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE HOMECOMING HE RECEIVED. CARS WERE LINED UP FOR A FURTHER INVESTIGATION, AND HIS FRONT YARD WAS FULL OF CURIOUS.

ITEM X - A MG F OH MEARI FORT CAMPBELL HAD COME OUT TO DO THE SAO THING I HAD HAD DONE LIKE WHAT THIS....TIM.....DRA. AN ARTIST'S CONCEPTION OF THE LITTLE MEH.....BY THIS WAT....HE SOLDIER HAD NOT SEED MY DRAWING......AND WITH....... HE BEGAD PUTTING TOGETHER A DRATIHG THAT VAS HIGHLY SIMILAR TO MINK. THE OUL? HAD PART OF THE WHOLE THING TAS SAYING UP, TOOK OFF E1TC SONE A ID SIMPLY DISAPPEARED. THE ARTIST'S COSCEPIIOM DETAILS... HEAD 'WHICH HO ONE ELSE HAD SEEN, AND THE VAST VARIETY OF FEATURES WITCH NO ONE ELSE HAD EVER DETECTED. = WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING HIS POPULARITY.....AT THIS POINT THE DOOR VAS THROWN OPEN......AND HE STOOD R - WHO SCOFFED AND SAID.."WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?". I GOT THE DEFINITE IMPRESSION THAT HIS MOTHER IN LAW ......RS ......HAD PLEAD WITH HIM TO REMOVE ALL SIGHTSEERS FROM THE HOUSE AND SURROUNDINGS AND HE WAS ABOUT TO START WITH US. HOWEVER, BEFORE HE DID ANYTHING ELSE, HIS WIFE STOPPED HIM ONTO THE SMALL DRIVEWAY. LANLING WAS LAYING. WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. HE STAND DOWN, AND ONE COULD TELL FROM THE LOOK ON HIS FACE THAT WE HAD STRUCK HOME WITH THAT PICTURE. HE LOOKED IT OVER, STARTED TO SHAKE HIS HEAD, AND SAID..."NO, THE FACEMASK IS ALMOST LIFE SIZE. IT DOESN'T COME TO A POINT". WE GOT RIGHT TO WORK ON THE SECOND DRAWING, USING THIS FIRST AS A GUIDE, MAKING CHANGES IN THE SECOND AS WE WENT ALONG. AT ONE POINT HE STOPPED UP TO DISCOBE HOT HAD FIRED CF THE APPARITION THE NIGHT 13FORI1, BRINGING THE SHOTGUN DOWN TO BEAR OF THE LITTLE FELLOW...ONLY FEET AWAY.....IN MY JUDGEMENT, IS NOT THE IINE TO BECOME EASILY FRIGHTENED, THAT IS, UNTIL THINGS GET BEYOND THE AVERAGE UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE. THEN THE TWELVE'S CAREEN BEHOLD TO HAVE ALL RESPECT. HE TURNED AND RETREATED INTO THE HOUSE. HE VOLUNTEERED TEE INFORMATION AT THAT POINT, THAT, WHEN THE SHOT STRUCK THE OBJECT, "IT SOUNDED AS THO I HAD BEEN FIRING AT A BUCKET." THE FIPINE PROGRESSED MUCH AS THE FIRST DID.....THE HEAD WAS BALD, ALL AGREED ON THAT. THE CHIN THAT.....SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER WAS ROUND, MAKING THE HEAD AN ALMOST PERFECT CIRCLE. THE MOUTH AS IN THE FIRST CASE, WAS NOT MUCH MORE THAN A LINE STRAIGHT ACROSS THE FACE, AND THE EYES COULDN'T DESCRIBE ANY OTHER OUTSTANDING FEATURES WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THEY WERE FLAPPY, AND CONSIDERABLY TALLER THAN THE WOULD-BE DESCRIPTION HAD INDICATED.

BEYOND THAT, THEY WERE SWEPT BACK, MORE OF A HUMMING' NEAR.THEY DID AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BASIC FORM OF THE EAR WAS CORRECT. BECAUSE OF THIS CONSTERNATION EARLIER, OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF A HOAX, I HAD AT THAT POINT OF LEADING THEM UP TO THAT QUESTION. WITH NO INDEED ANY INFORMATION ABOUT IT. NONE OF THE THREE HAD BEEN ONE...AND THERE WAS SURE THERE WAS ANY. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT...WHO WAS LISTENING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AS HE WORKED WITH THE SOLDIER ON THAT DRAWING, SAID HE HAD DEFINITLY SEEN IT, HOWEVER,___ GAVE HIM A DISDAINFUL LOOK...AND___ AFTER SOME HEDGING, ADMITTED AND SAID HE WASN'T SURE. THAT GAVE THE SOLDIER A BAD OUTLOOK ON_AND HIS STARTED POINT BY POINT OVER HIS DRAWING AGAIN WITH HIM. WE RETURNED TO OUR ORIGINAL THE STANDING CONSULTATION CONTINUED, AS THE MAN CONTINUED TO COGENTRATE. DISAGREE WITH, OR ADVANCE SOME NEW FEATURE. THE BODY ABOVE THE WAIST WAS POWERFUL AND FLUILT, THIN AND SPINDLY, AS THE LEGS AND ARMS WERE MADE OF BROOM HANDLES. AGAIN, WE FOUND. AS WITH THE WOMAN, THE MEN HAD NOT SEEN ANY FEET._HOWEVER, WHO WAS STILL BEING INTERVIEWED BY THE SOLDIER, TOLD OF FEET THAT RESEMBLED SUCTION CUPS, BUT SINCE HE WAS IN THE MINORITY, WE DECIDED NOT TO MAKE ANY MENTION OF FEET, EXCEPT FOR A WINDING IN THAT AREA. THE ASSUMPTION HERE MAY BE HAD OR GOOD, HOWEVER: IT SEEMED REASONABLE THAT THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE TO SEE HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST THE LEGS TO SUPPORT IT, AS IT WERE. PERHAPS IT'S A FALSE IDEA TWO...BECAUSE WEIGHT WAS NO PROBLEM' APPARENTLY...THEY COULD FLOAT DOWN F OM ROOF-TOPS, THE HANDS WERE LARGE...WAY OUT OF SIZE...OF THAT THEY ALL AGED. THE OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF THE ARMS AND HANDS WERE THE SAME IN BOTH THE WOMEN'S AND MEN'S DESCRIPTIONS, WITH THIS EXCEPTION. LUCLY VENTURED THE POSSIBILITY OF WEBBING BETWEEN THE TALONS, ABOVE THE FIRST KNUCKLE. THIS REMARK WAS UNSOLICITED ALSO. AND SO IT WENT...UNTIL THE IMAGE WAS AS COMPLETE AS IT COULD BE HOWEVER STRANGE SOME OF THE FINAL DETAILS BECAME, AND WE HAD TO CLOSE THE SESSION, AS THE MAN HAD NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO EAT -THEIR SUPPER...LET ALONE TALK WITH ANYONE.

ARE GIVING OUR DISCUSSIONS AND DRAFTING. WE SPENT ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR TALKING WITH THIS T..., WHOM AND WOMEN WHO THEM GAVE IN...AND THEY DECIDED WE HAD TIPPED THE ...LY ENOUGH. A QUICK CHECK WITH THE SOLDIER WHO WAS JUST COMPLETING HIS FIRST (AND LAST ASSUMED) FRAMING, AND IT REVEALED AN AMAZING SIMILARITY, EVEN TO THE PROPRTION IT HAD WORKED OUT FROM HOME..WE WENT TO THE PICTURE POINT BY POINT...(
ROAD SIGNS AND STORE FRONTS HAD BEEN CLEANED UP BY..ONLY. WHETHER OR NOT...IT'S ATTEMPTED TO GET TO LA INGS FROM THE WOMEN AND THEM I DON'T KNOW. CONSIDERING THE,..PERSON ON..., I DOUBT IT WAS DID.
I WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE AT THIS POINT THAT THESE SEVEN ADULTS HAD TOLD AN ALMOST PARALLEL STORIES, AND GIVEN ME ALMOST PARALLEL PICTURES, YET THESE OF ALMOST DAILY THE SIGHTING FOR WISCONSIN AND HAD NOT BEEN MOST REPORTED TO THE THAT DAY. IT WOULD BE I-POSSIBLE FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE TO GIVE ME TWO SEPARATE PICTURES THAT WOULD TALLY SO CLOSE WITHOUT FIRST TALKING TOGETHER AND DECIDING WHAT EACH FEATURE LOOKED LIKE. THIS WAS NOT AN INTERVIEW WHERE ONE WOULD LOOK AT THE OTHER AND SAY..."IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK IT LOOKED LIKE"...CH NO...ALL SEVEN WERE SURE OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN...AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF...AND THE CLOSE DECISIONS..ONE WOULD DECIDEDLY THEY HAD BEEN..EVEN UNDER CLOSE CROSS-EXAMINATION. ( I USE THAT WORD LIGHTLY. MIND YOU) ( YOU COULDN'T EXACTLY SAY THAT.)THROUGHOUT THE WEEKS PERIOD I TRIED TO ASSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE ATTITUDE. I MADE A MENTAL NOTE NOT TO BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE, BUT TO REPORT THE INCIDENT AS IT WAS TOLD TO ME FROM THE FAMILY'S LIPS. ACTUALLY, I NEARLY BELIVED I WAS IN A UNIQUE POSITION, BECAUSE UNTIL THE TIME I REACHED THE STATION, I HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE INCIDENT, AND AFTER I HEARD THEM, I DECIDED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND UNTIL I COULD TELL FOR MYSELF.

I'VE HEARD PEOPLE NOTE TO NOTE HOW THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER REPORTS....INSTEAD OF A TWO-EYED OBJECT THAT WAS SILVERY IN APPEARANCE, IT SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED INTO A ONE-EYED LITTLE GREEN MAN. THIS IS JUST ONE MINOR INSTANCE OF HOW THE STORY MATERIAL WAS ALTERED.

ANYONE WHO TELLS THE TALE SEEMS TO ADD HIS OWN INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THESE OBJECTS LOOKED LIKE. FOR THIS REASON, I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED THAT WE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CASE BEING INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INITIAL ONSET OF SIGHTSEERS. THE WOMEN WERE RELAXED....AND WE HAD NO DISTURBANCE FOR TWO FULL HOURS. THAT MIGHT WE GOT THE MEN IN THE SAME CONDITION. UNDOUBTEDLY...BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE HAPPENINGS WITH THEIR WIVES AND FRIENDS. I WAS HIGHLY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR SINCERITY, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, AS ONE COULD FACTOR WAS STILL IN EVIDENCE WHEN I ARRIVED THAT MORNING......THEY WERE STILL FRIGHTENED....AND WERE NOT OVER IT WHEN I LAST SAW THEM.

THIS REPORT OF THE NAVY OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS RELATING TO UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IS FORWARDED FOR YOUR INFORMATION. THE REPORT IS PRESENTED AS RECEIVED FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.
ON THE EVENING OF AUGUST 6 1955 A GLOWING CIRCULAR OBJECT WAS OBSERVED MOVING RAPIDLY OVER THE SKY FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL WITNESSES IN THE OLD GREENWICH SECTION OF GREENWICH CONNECTICUT. 
THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:45 P.M. IN THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF THE SKY AND WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE GLOWING AND ROUND IN SHAPE. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE AIRCRAFT AND MOVED AT A RAPID RATE OF SPEED DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW IN THE NORTHEAST PORTION OF THE SKY.
SEVERAL PERSONS OBSERVED THE OBJECT AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT. AT LEAST ONE WITNESS STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE LUMINOUS AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE SURROUNDED BY A GLOW OR HAZE.
THE REPORT STATES THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT OR ANY OTHER KNOWN TYPE OF VEHICLE. IT IS BELIEVED TO BE A GENUINE UFO SIGHTING.

According to the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output, the text in the document reads:

"THIS WAS NOT THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL WHERE ONE WOULD LOOK FOR A HOAX OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. HIS HOME WAS A WELL-KEPT ONE AND HIS FAMILY SEEMED QUITE NORMAL - THE TYPE OF WITNESS THAT ONE USUALLY LOOKS FOR IN A CASE LIKE THIS. HIS STORY SOUNDED SINCERE AND I BE LIEVE IT. HE GAVE ME QUITE A FEW FACTS ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND THEY ALL SEEMED TO CHECK OUT. 

ALTHOUGH THIS HAPPENED IN A RATHER REMOTE AREA, THERE WERE SEVEN OR EIGHT CONCERNED CITIZENS WHO ALSO WITNESSED THE INCIDENT AND COULD VERIFY HIS STORY.

THROUGHOUT THIS I HAVE TRIED TO ADHERE TO AN ATTITUDE OF SKEPTICISM. I WAS A INITIAL BOUT ONE OF THOSE WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN FLYING SAUCERS. HOWEVER, AS I HAVE LOOKED INTO THE EVIDENCE, AND AS WITNESSES HAVE TOLD ME THEIR STORIES, I HAVE CHANGED MY OPINION SOMEWHAT. I STILL AM QUITE SKEPTICAL OF SOME OF THE WILD REPORTS THAT GET CIRCULATED, BUT I DO FEEL THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO THESE INCIDENTS. CERTAINLY, I WOULD SEE NO REASON TO HOAX AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS AND I BELIEVE THE WITNESS IN THIS CASE. THIS REPORT MAY THUS BE OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUM OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THIS SUBJECT."

Transcribing the text from the document:

on 6 August 1955 a resident of old Greenwich, Connecticut reported seeing a strange object in the sky at approximately 11:40 pm. the object was described as being circular in shape, about the size of a dime held at arm's length, and luminous. it was observed for about 15 seconds before it suddenly disappeared. the witness, a mature and reliable person, stated that the object moved rapidly and silently, and appeared to be at an altitude of about 500 feet. it was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known object. the weather was clear at the time and the object was tracked visually until it vanished. the witness is a professional person with a good reputation for reliability and honesty. the report was made to the local police and then forwarded to project blue book. no further information is available.

OCR Text Output:

THIS IS A SUMMARY OF WHAT I OR WE SAW - THIS ENCOUNTER WAS ENTIRELY UNLIKE ANY OTHER SIGHTING WE HAVE EVER HAD.
THIS WAS THE MOST BIZARRE SIGHTING FOR US TO DATE. THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND THE COLOR WAS A LUMINOUS SILVER. IT WAS HOVERING ABOUT 50 FEET OFF THE GROUND. IT SEEMED TO HAVE SOME FORM OF STRUCTURE, AND WHEN IT WAS EXAMINED LATER BY EXPERTS IT WAS FOUND TO BE OF SOME UNKNOWN COMPOSITION. IT WAS ALSO ROTATING SLOWLY ON ITS OWN AXIS.
AS WE APPROACHED CLOSER TO GET A BETTER VIEW, IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY AWAY FROM US AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 20 MPH. SUDDENLY IT ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND SHOT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AT AN UNBELIEVABLE RATE OF SPEED. IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. THE WHOLE ENCOUNTER LASTED LESS THAN TWO MINUTES.
THE OBJECT GAVE OFF NO EXHAUST OR NOISE OF ANY KIND. THERE WAS A SLIGHT HAZE OR SHIMMER VISIBLE AROUND IT WHICH MADE IT APPEAR TO BE SURROUNDED BY SOME KIND OF FORCE FIELD OR ENERGY SOURCE. IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT WITH NO WIND, AND THE OBJECT SEEMED TO MOVE WITHOUT MAKING ANY SOUND.
AFTER IT DISAPPEARED, WE FELT STUNNED AND AMAZED AT WHAT WE HAD WITNESSED. WE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS TO THE AUTHORITIES, BUT WERE TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT CONFIRM OR DENY ANYTHING ABOUT OUR SIGHTING. THIS INCIDENT IS STILL A MYSTERY TO US.

The text in the document is as follows:

OUR INFORMATION REPORT ITEM ID: ... HIS LOCATION. UNDER COVER OF"DARKNESS ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 27,1955, HE SAW WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHT LIGHT... CROSS THE SKY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH APPARENTLY MOVING AT A HIGH SPEED. HE SAID IT DISAPPEARED AS IF IT WENT BEHIND A CLOUD. HE SAID IT WAS NOT A SATELLITE, METEOR, NOR A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT WITH WHICH HE WAS FAMILIAR. HE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS SOME SORT OF UNCONVENTIONAL AERIAL OBJECT. HIS INVESTIGATION, THROUGH CONVERSATION WITH NEIGHBORS, DISCLOSED THAT THEY HAD ALSO OBSERVED THE SAME PHENOMENA. FURTHER THEY SEEMED AVERSE TO DISCUSSING THE MATTER OPENLY. THEY APPARENTLY WOULD FIRE THROUGH THE WINDOW...IT WOULD FLIP OVER OR FALL BACK AND DISAPPEAR FOR A FEW MINUTES. HOWEVER THEY KEPT COMING BACK...THIS AFTER TIME SOMEONE DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE ADVERSE TO LIGHT...THEIR ACTIONS WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY WERE OBSERVING SOME KIND OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. THEIR CURIOSITY AND THE EVENTS WOULD ONLY BE TERMINATED BY THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

THIS APPEARS TO BE A REPORT OF SOME SORT OF UFO SIGHTING THAT TOOK PLACE IN OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT ON AUGUST 6, 1955. 

THE REPORT DESCRIBES AN INCIDENT WHERE A WOMAN NAMED XXXXX XXXX REPORTED SEEING A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE OBJECT WAS BRIGHT AND MOVING VERY FAST. IT INITIALLY APPEARED AS A SMALL LIGHT, BUT THEN GREW IN SIZE AS IT APPROACHED. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS HAVING A ROUND OR DISC-LIKE SHAPE. 

THE REPORT STATES THAT XXXXX XXXX CALLED HER HUSBAND TO COME LOOK AT THE OBJECT, BUT BY THE TIME HE ARRIVED, IT HAD ALREADY MOVED AWAY AND DISAPPEARED. IT MENTIONS THAT XXXXX XXXX WAS "QUITE SHAKEN" BY THE EXPERIENCE.

THE REPORT ALSO MENTIONS THAT OTHER RESIDENTS IN THE AREA APPARENTLY ALSO SAW THE OBJECT, AND THAT THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE POLICE. HOWEVER, NO OTHER DETAILS ARE PROVIDED ABOUT THESE OTHER WITNESSES OR THE POLICE RESPONSE.

OVERALL, THIS APPEARS TO BE A FIRST-HAND ACCOUNT OF A UFO SIGHTING THAT TOOK PLACE IN OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT IN AUGUST 1955, AS PART OF THE PROJECT BLUE BOOK INVESTIGATIONS.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"THE INCIDENT HAPPENED ON AUGUST 3rd, 1955, ABOUT 8 PM, IN OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT. I WAS SITTING IN MY LIVING ROOM WATCHING TELEVISION WHEN MY WIFE CALLED ME TO THE WINDOW. SHE SAID SHE HAD JUST SEEN A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY. I HURRIED TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED UP AND SAW A BRIGHTLY-LIT OBJECT HIGH IN THE SKY. IT WAS ROUND AND LUMINOUS, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. IT MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND THEN SUDDENLY SHOT OFF AT A TERRIFIC SPEED AND DISAPPEARED. I CALLED MY NEIGHBOR, MR. BROWN, WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR, AND HE ALSO SAW THE OBJECT. WE BOTH WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN AIRPLANE, HELICOPTER, OR ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. I AM QUITE FAMILIAR WITH ALL CONVENTIONAL AERIAL VEHICLES, AND THIS WAS NOTHING LIKE ANY OF THEM. IT SEEMED TO BE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND MADE NO SOUND WHATSOEVER. THE INCIDENT LASTED ONLY A FEW MINUTES, BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SKY. AFTER IT DISAPPEARED, I DECIDED TO REPORT THE INCIDENT TO THE AUTHORITIES. I RECEIVED A VISIT FROM TWO MILITARY OFFICERS WHO TOOK A DETAILED REPORT FROM ME. THEY SEEMED VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT I HAD SEEN AND TOLD ME THAT SIMILAR REPORTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THEY ADVISED ME NOT TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT WITH ANYONE ELSE. I AM STILL PUZZLED BY WHAT I SAW THAT NIGHT AND WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE IN THE AREA WITNESSED THE SAME PHENOMENON."

Performing OCR on the text:

I VISITED THE SCENE OF THE LANDING AS SOON AS I WAS NOTIFIED TO DO SO. THERE WERE SOME 75 TO 100 PERSONS PRESENT WHEN I ARRIVED WHO HAD ALSO GONE TO THE SCENE SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED. THE OBJECT HAD LANDED IN A PASTURE ON THE LAND OF MR. P. H. WARD, AN ELDERLY RETIRED FARMER WHO LIVED ABOUT ONE HALF MILE FROM THE VILLAGE MAIN STREET.
THE OBJECT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND APPEARED TO BE MADE OF A METALLIC MATERIAL SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO ALUMINUM BUT HIGHLY POLISHED AND REFLECTING THE SUNLIGHT. IT WAS RESTING ON A TRIPOD-LIKE LANDING GEAR ABOUT 3 FEET HIGH. THERE WERE NO WINDOWS, DOORS OR ANY OTHER VISIBLE OPENINGS IN THE OBJECT. AS I WALKED AROUND IT I NOTICED THAT IT WAS SLIGHTLY WARM TO THE TOUCH AND A VERY SLIGHT HISSING SOUND COULD BE HEARD, APPARENTLY FROM SOME INTERNAL SOURCE.
ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE WITNESSES, THE OBJECT HAD FIRST BEEN SIGHTED HOVERING OVER THE PASTURE AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 100 FEET. IT THEN SLOWLY DESCENDED AND CAME TO REST ON THE GROUND. THERE WAS NO SMOKE, EXHAUST OR OTHER VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF PROPULSION. THE ONLY VISIBLE CHANGE WAS A SLIGHT RIPPLING EFFECT AROUND THE RIM OF THE OBJECT AS IT SETTLED ON THE GROUND. THERE WAS SOME SLIGHT DISTURBANCE OF THE GRASS AND WEEDS UNDER THE OBJECT, APPARENTLY DUE TO SOME TYPE OF FORCE OR SUCTION CREATED DURING THE LANDING.
