10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Observer submitted a colored film transparency of what is purported to be a "flying saucer." In his report he states he observed the object, ran in the house for a camera (pony 35 MM) and snapped the object in flight. Observer states he would imagine the object as "150' in diameter, constructed of light metal and disc shaped." The object, the size of a pin head was almost perfectly centered on the film and resembled a blue-white elliptical object with a trail.

11. COMMENTS
Examination of MM by separate photo specialists (ATIC & WADC) & micro & macroscopic reviews of colored & black & white prints of various consistencies disclosed the the obj. was caused a flaw (either accidental or induced) in the film. The written report contains no conclusive evidence. ext. desc. size a head of pin, but gave details of its construction. Obj repd streaking sky from SW - NE yet considered for 15 min. Obj, almost perfectly centered in film, a remarkable feat to find - such a small obj. against a blacksky in viewfinder & center.

raced to the Hopkinsville police station. The police came in force, and they
searched all round the house: there was nothing to be found. No blood, no bodies,
no footprints. But the family was in a state of terror, and there was certainly
an evidence of drinking. The police finally left and an hour after they had gone
the little goblins were back again. Mrs. Glenn Landford, lying in bed, at one
time watched one through the window for several minutes. Before dawn, they had
gone, but not until more shots had been fired. Seven of the eight adults in the
house saw one or more of the little beings at one time or another.

I was in Mt. Vernon, Indiana, only about 50 miles away, when this story hit
the newspapers. The Evansville Courier-Press of August 22nd printed a detailed
account of it, with a drawing of one of the little men, based on the descriptions
given by the witnesses — weird-looking little creature. Since a member of my
family was dying, I couldn't leave at the time, so it was three days before I got
there.

And when I did get to Hopkinsville, I walked into a practical joke, which is
one of the things you have to watch out for when you're trying to investigate sub-
jects like this. A couple of newsmen whom I'd once played jokes on went to
a good deal of trouble to revenge themselves: they arranged an interview with a
phony "witness" who told me a lot of inaccurate and invented details. And he
tried to sell me a plaster cast which he said had been made from a footprint of
one of the creatures. If I'd bought it, they would have rubbed over. As it
was, it took me some time to catch on.

The funny thing about this is that the hoaxers were telling an essentially
true story, though I'm sure they didn't realize this themselves. Their plaster
cast was a fake, but the Kelly landing really did happen. Nobody has ever been
able to explain it away.

Another thing that they told me was not true of the Kelly case, but it was
true, as we both knew, of another outstanding success-landing case, that of the
so-called "Flatwoods Monster" seen at Sutton, West Virginia on September 12,1952.
Two or three days after that happened, a couple of "aluminum-ware salesmen" had
come around, who had stayed for about three hours not selling aluminum-ware, but
questioning the witnesses about the strange experience they had had. The next
day a fellow came along selling subscriptions to a magazine that is printed in
Augusta, Maine, and he worked the neighborhood over, questioning everybody
who had reported anything. The few people who ordered the aluminum-ware sub-
scribed to the magazine got their money back a couple of weeks later with no let-
ter of explanation at all. I leave to your imagination what agency was probably
behind these shenanigans. ----Clay Gentry, Sega. Aff/Addenda (Ret. Maj. AF
men - Assigned to Proj. Blue Book)

Well, the Kelly case had its comic aspects --and part of the joke was on me-
but there was nothing humorous about the second important case that I've had per-
sonal contact with in recent months. This one was a tragedy.

On January 5th of this year, at Bedford, Indiana, about 50 miles south of In-
dianapolis, the GOC spotted five flying saucers at one time, circling around. They
had been reported over Lafayette, Indiana, about 90 miles to the west, just a
short time before, and then they were seen south of Bedford, where they were watch-
ed by three or four hundred people. The farmers were calling each other back and

h. Hopkinsville Case: This case, which has not yet been brought to the "official" attention of the Air Force, may cause some embarrassment if suddenly omitted "cold" to ATIC. Preparatory counter-measures are considered warranted. I for this reason will continue information is being collected on this sighting. See Inclosure #1 for details of this bizarre sighting as written by Frank Edwards, noted TV and radio broadcaster. Every effort was made through the indirect efforts of our Informant to either initiate some direct investigative action or obtain what had been done officially without directly involving the Air Forces. See attached Office Memo dated 10 September 1956 (Inclosure #2), and a list of numerous principles involved in this case (Inclosure #3). A sketch of one of the "humanoid" creatures is also attached (Inclosure #4). It has been reported that a native in the area stated there was a circus train near town a day or two before. However, this cannot be confirmed and in the opinion of Dr. Hueck and the undersigned, if so, it is possible that some monkeys or apes escaped during the night. (Note: The undersigned recalls reading a few years ago in the New York Herald that circus owners seldom report escaping animals to the local police, until all efforts by circus crews to recapture them had failed.) In many instances, the animals return on their own.)

Hopkinsville Case. The report given to you that the incident was reported to "Stanford Field" gave us a little trouble. There is no Stanford or Stewart Field. The nearest AFB is Sewart in Smyrna, Tennessee, quite some distance away. Therefore, our plan to contact the nearest AFB to Hopkinsville for particulars will be kept in abeyance pending receipt of the following information: What field was the incident reported to? Date of sighting or incident? Name the family? Would appreciate if you can help us out on this, Dr. Hynek. It seems the scrap of paper which some of this information was taken was lost or misplaced.

Report on Hopkinsville Finished, Must Still be Printed: The long-awaited "Hopkinsville landing report," by USI members Isabel Davis and Arthur Leavy, has now been completed in preliminary typescript form, under the title of The Landing at Kelly - August 21-22, 1955. This landing case - which the authors consider ranks as one of the most extraordinary and most extra-ordinary on record. The authors have investigated it very thoroughly and they present their results in detail, including maps, diagrams, photographs, and sketches of the "little men" as described by the eyes, witnesses the day after the incident occurred.

The report, 50 pages long as it now stands, will be made available to members after final revisions have been made, a fair copy has been typed, and a photo-offset edition has been printed.

22. If we may add a touch of levity to this discussion of UFO cases, we have knowledge of a rather fantastic case that has never been reported to us. UFO writers and clubs refer to it as the "Hopkinsville Case". Briefly, as the story goes, in 1955 a family near Hopkinsville, Kentucky was subjected to an all-night attack by green-goblin-like creatures which emerged from a "flying saucer" nearby. Shot-guns and rifles proved ineffective against these creatures who tried to enter the family's cabin. They left upon the break of dawn. This is a reproduction of the creatures, as allegedly sworn to by all 3 members of the family. We have been informed by a reliable contact that a book is being written on the case, and that the Air Force will be asked to officially comment, before the book is released.

But as to his being deluged with flying saucer mail, I can only say to you that it was one of the smallest deluge in history. I read my audiences one night if they wanted me to continue reporting on flying saucer sightings, because it was becoming difficult, the wire services wouldn't carry them any more, and I thought maybe interest had lagged. I got over 5000 letters --addressed to me at the Mutual studios, more than a mile from Mr. Keany's office. At the AFL building, in my office, all that came in was 2 letters and 12 postcards. I guess this must have been the "deluge". That Mr. Keany complained of. He said also that "we were not particularly interested in flying saucers." That's peculiar too, because, only about two months before, the AFL newspaper had run a special article on flying saucers, which I wrote at the request of Mr. George, the editor of the paper.

Well, the truth is that flying saucers really had nothing at all to do with my (City) from the AFL's radio program, as those of you who have read my book will agree. They just provided a convenient peg on which Mr. Keany could hang his statement of dismissal. I'm sure that there were some other reasons why Keany was not out of the picture, and I have the facts on that not down in my book. It was something far more --maybe- I'd better leave the word alone-- I wanted to say reprehensible, and maybe it is reprehensible-- I'll let you read the book and decide for yourself.

Actually, the fellow did me a favor. There were only three night radio programs that were going at that time. --TV was murdering the rest. Due to the fact that we were doing an unusual type of program, I happened to have one of the three. But I was working 12 to 14 hours a day to get the job done; I had to wear, while I was working, a top hat that was very dilapidated that we had to wear such a number when we came to the parking of the ways. In the long run it was probably a good thing-- I'm certainly a lot happier now doing my television show at WJTV. There are no strings attached to anything I say, I decide what I'm going to use, and how I'm going to use it.

Let me tell you now about a couple of the most important flying-saucer cases that have come up since I've been at WJTV.

The first is a very strange thing that happened on August 21st, last year, near Hopkinsville, Kentucky. It made headlines in the newspapers out there, and for once it was carried by the press wires --it suppose just because they thought it was ridiculous. You may remember reading the wire story about "little green man" --actually they weren't green, some rewrite ran put that in because he thought they ought to be green.

In the middle of the night eleven people rushed from a farmhouse in the little village of Kelly, 8 miles north of Hopkinsville, to get police protection against goblin-like creatures from a flying saucer, who had been besieging them for three hours. Shortly after sunset, one of the men had seen a saucer come down in a field behind the house. Soon afterward, they saw some creature coming toward the house. As it came closer, they saw something like a little man, about 3 feet tall, with a huge head, and enormous glowing eyes. Its long arms hung almost to the ground, and its big hands had long claws on the fingers. Its body had a metallic appearance, and glowed in the dark. When they saw this thing, the men went for their guns --a shotgun and a .22 rifle. For three hours these little creatures kept coming up to the house, and the men kept shooting at them, apparently with no effect. Some of the creatures were shot at a range of twenty feet or less, but they never seemed to be wounded; it merely discouraged them for a few minutes. Finally, about 11 o'clock, the terrified family piled into two cars and

I was sitting on the back porch with the family talking about nothing particular. I remember that it was a warm summer evening in late August. I just happened to look up and notice a bright object moving across the sky from south-south-west to north-north-east at what must have been a great speed because of the short time that it took to vanish. When we first noticed it it was moving from our right to our left. I went inside and got my camera ( a Kodak Pony 135mm Model B ) and took a photograph of it at its nearest point. ( I don't know what the settings were )

As we watched, it continued to move to our left and appear smaller and smaller until it had vanished.

One must take into consideration that the above incident occurred in August and it is now March. At the time that it happened I paid no great attention to the conditions at that time. The reason that I took the picture was, I thought it might be an

1. In accordance with established ATIC policies for analysis of unidentified
flying objects, request your analysis and comments regarding the attached photo-
graphs of a UFO.

2. To assist you in this matter, the standard USAF UFO questionnaire is also
attached.

3. After review of the prints made from the color slide submitted with the
UFO report, there is definitely a pronounced curvature of the tail characteristic
of a meteor. However, the camera used has only a 1/200 second speed, which would
make it difficult to obtain this photo unless "panning" was used. Again, the ob-
server claims this object was in sight for 15 minutes.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

July 19, 1956

Mr. [redacted]
Shore Lands
Old Greenwich, Connecticut

Dear Mr. Donahue:

Captain Gregory of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has called my attention, as consultant to the Air Force on matters pertaining to upper atmosphere phenomena, to a remarkable photograph, which was made at 9:30 p.m. in late August of last year. He has asked me to get in touch with you if possible in order to obtain a few more details. It so happens that I shall be in Hartford, Connecticut, on July 26. I do not know how far this is from your home but perhaps we could arrange to meet, without too much difficulty.

I understand that you are, or were, a student at the Ohio State University. In that case, our paths may have already crossed since, as you may know, I am a professor of Astronomy at Ohio State University. At present I am on leave at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, working on the Artificial Satellite Project.

I hope that we can arrange to meet, even briefly, to clear away a few points about your photograph that are not quite clear to me now. Would you be kind enough to let me know whether you could arrange to see me on that day, or if not, when such a meeting might be possible.

Sincerely yours,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE OFFICE OF SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR

SUBJECT: Case History - Colored UFO Film Slide Submitted by the
UFO Research Council.

1. Purpose of this memorandum is to submit a brief summary of
the action taken, results reached and other significant points re-
garding this case. On the basis of previous trying experiences with
the few UFO films and photographs submitted to the Air Force, and the
controversial and complications that later resulted, every effort was
made to carry the matter to a firm, final conclusion.

2. Slide was submitted by the UFO Research Council of Cleveland
during our investigation of four cases submitted to the Center. This
organization has been particularly troublesome since a briefing and
interview was granted them by ATIC in January of this year. Briefly,
they are still "beating on ATIC's door" demanding information on
specific cases and requesting group interviews. All correspondence
efforts by both this office and the Air Intelligence office has failed
to discourage them.

3. Slide purports to show a flying object, disc-shaped and esti-
mated at 125 feet according to Mr. [illegible], the observer. See attached
UFO report.

4. This office immediately prepared both black and white and
color prints of varying sizes and densities as an aid to examination
and analysis (representative copies attached).

5. A three-hour conference of ATIC photo specialists was held on
the morning of 8 August 1956 upon request of the undersigned. The
following were the prime conferees:

Major R. M. Buckmaster, Chief, Photo Section
Major W. F. Willner, Chief, Photo Analysis Branch
Mr. L. L. Griffin, Photo Specialist

6. A conference was held at WADC's Technical Photo Division,
Area 3, between 0300-0930 hours regarding certain technical reproductive
aspects of the film slide. Conferees were:

Captain Clemente Mr. Lowry
Mr. Hansell Mr. Guthrie

7. To investigate this matter from every possible angle, it was
suggested that Dr. Hynek (who resides near the vicinity of Old Greenwich)
informally talk with the UFO photographer, to obtain some
impressions regarding the source or information on the sighting. (See
attached letter from Dr. Hynek.)

Here is the OCR text from the document:

8. ATIC photo specialists and undersigned approached the matter from the viewpoint that the object was either a meteor or the exhaust of an aircraft in flight. However, microscopic, macroscopic and other examinations disclosed that the object was the result of a defect in the film emulsion, probably caused by a chemical reaction during the color processing. The trail or streak behind the object apparently resulted, concurrently, from what is termed a "bromide drag".

9. All three ATIC photo specialists are in agreement as to the above conclusion.

10. WADC specialists also arrived at the same conclusions, independently and without knowledge of ATIC's findings (see para 6 above).

11. The UFO questionnaire which attempted to correlate the sighting with the film must, therefore, be considered as a deliberate hoax, with the probability that the source first found the object on the slide, then later prepared a fictitious UFO report to ATIC.

12. This office has reason to believe that this sighting was presented to members of two separate so-called UFO private organizations. It may, therefore, receive wide-spread notoriety through newspaper articles and similar media.

13. Normally, we do not present our specific findings or conclusions to UFO sources or observers. Volume alone would make this an impossibility. However, it is the opinion of this office that the results of our specific conclusions should be made known to this organization in no uncertain terms, short of telling them that the contributor of the film attempted to deliberately perpetrate a hoax on the Air Force.

14. The recommendations made in the preceding paragraph may serve to curtail this private UFO organization's constant demand for personal intervention and UFO investigation. "With regard to the latter, as investigation in June of this year of all sightings submitted to us by this organization indicated that, with one possible exception, none of the sightings had merit and, in fact, bordered on the "fantastic" or "scientific" categories.

15. In keeping with the above recommendations submitted in paragraphs 12 and 13 above, and subject to your approval, attached is a proposed reply to the head of this private UFO organization.

SUBJECT: (U) [redacted] Case - Attempts to Interview by Dr. Hynek, Report

1. Reference letter from Dr. Hynek, 19 July 1956, relative to a proposed plan for interviewing Mr. Donahue, in case file.

2. In conference between Dr. Hynek and undersigned in Cambridge, Mass., on 13 Sept 1955, Dr. Hynek stated that after receiving no reply to his correspondence, contacted the address and phone number given by Mr. [redacted] on the UFO questionnaire.

3. Dr. Hynek was informed that no one by that name was known at that address.

Colored UFO Hln Slide. I have requested two (2) 4 x 5 colored prints and two (2) 8 x 10 colored prints. One set will be forwarded to you. Have asked for a photo-analysis and comments from our people specifically with regard to the following aircraft, guided missiles or those possibilities:

a. Why the odd coloration of the background (sky)?
b. Could it be a jet aircraft from a dark colored jet aircraft? (Navy jets, for example, are very dark blue, almost black. On a dark, moonless night - only the jet exhaust would show).
c. Any indications of any sheath, covering or orifice at the head of this object?

As for the astronomical possibilities, I'm sure the colored prints will be of great value in making your determination.

6. [redacted] Case (Flying Saucer File): The investigation of this case was planned as two independent causes of action: Dr. Hynek to somehow interview and interrogate Mr. Donahue who mailed the film, and the undersigned to submit the film to both ATIC and WADC specialists for a thorough analysis. Extensive tests proved the film a hoax. The purported saucer was caused by emulsion flaws (either deliberate or accidental). Receiving no reply from correspondence, Dr. Hynek attempted to contact Mr. [redacted] by telephone but to no avail, and it was further learned Mr. [redacted] never had lived at the address given. Case closed.

2. Desired that print sizes be approximately as follows:
   2 each* 3 x 5
   2 each  8 x 10

3. Black and white prints of subject slide have been critically reviewed and analyzed by both ATIC photo specialists and USAF scientist on astronomical matters. It is their considered opinion that an analysis of good, clear color reproduction will result in a more firm conclusion as to the nature or identity of the object.

4. Your comments or opinion regarding this photographed UFO would be appreciated.

EXCLUSIVE - TRC STUDIES AMAZING COLOR PHOTO
OF UFO: TRC is now examining one of the most conclusive UFO
photographs ever taken! It is not photographic detail which makes
this photo from other authentic pictures. . . It is the fact that the
UFO involved is shown on a color Kodachrome slide.

The photographer was talking with his parents at approx.
3:30 p.m. in his August, 1955, Kodak Pony
Model B, 35 mm. with film. Suddenly, approaching from
the south, they all saw a brilliant glowing object. It moved toward
the north and followed a horizontal trajectory. At its nearest point
to the observers, the photographer took the picture.

Since the object was not too large in the sky, it was generally
agreed that the film probably would show nothing. However,
when the slide was returned from the processing laboratory, a remarkable reproduced of the object was present. The object was
just a blue-white dot when it was observed with the naked eye. The
trail behind it was a deep blue color. When observed with a magnifying glass the object takes on a definite disc-shape with a spinning halo glow!

The disc involved is certainly not a light from any airborne
object. The observers heard or saw nothing except the brilliant
light in the sky. After studying the photo for a period of time, it
is realized that the only possible known object that could account
for such an image is a meteor. However, this is still view of the observer.

Meteoric speeds are so fast (at ordinary cameras will not stop
their motion). Even astronomical cameras are not capable of this.
Photographs of meteors merely show a straight line on the film.
The object in question was obviously not traveling at meteoric
speeds because the simple Kodak camera stopped its motion!

Also, the observer states that all witnesses watched the object
for a long time in order to get a good look at it and photograph it.
In such a length of time any meteor would be far gone and, if by
some fantastic chance the observer did get a photograph of it, the
meteor would only appear as a thin, white line and not a blue-
white disc!

Study of this unusual photograph is still underway. A tele-
vision photo expert has informed TRC that, in his opinion, the ob-
ject is an authentic photograph of some kind of space craft moving
through the Earth's upper atmosphere at incredible speed. Physi-
cians have decided the strange trail or tail could be due to
ionization of the atmosphere.

At any rate, the photograph remains one of the most conclu-
sive pieces of evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation!

OBSERVER REPORTS JET PLANE "THEFT" BY UFO!
Mr. Eugene Metcalf of Paris, Illinois, has sent TRC complete par-
ticulars on his reported sighting of March 9, 1955. This sighting
involved the "theft" of a jet plane by a "flying saucer". The fol-
lowing are Metcalf's own words: "On March 9, 1955, at approxi-
mately 3:50 p.m., I witnessed the 'plane-napping' of a jet plane
while standing in my backyard at home in Paris, Illinois. The plane
was coming towards me from the southeast and was traveling in a
northeastern direction. As I stood watching this plane, an odd-
looking craft came from behind the plane and just swallowed it!
The UFO had an opening that was in my line of vision and through
this opening it took the plane. After this, the object hovered and
pulsated or churned up and down, then it seemed to whirl and lifted
upwards. While going through these gyrations, vapor came from
porthole-like openings around the bottom part. The plane and
UFO were in perfect view and stood out clearly against the sky.
The object was a bright silver and I heard no noise. The UFO was
very big and bell-shaped."

Mr. Metcalf's story is certainly an amazing one but there have
been other "plane-napping" sightings in the last few years.

The UFO had an opening that was in my line of vision and through
this opening it took the plane. After this, the object hovered and
pulsated or churned up and down, then it seemed to whirl and lifted
upward. While going through these gyrations, vapor came from

MEMORANDUM FOR THE OFFICE OF SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR

SUBJECT: Case History - Colored UFO Film Slide Submitted by the UFO Research Council.

1. Purpose of this memorandum is to submit a brief summary of action taken, results reached and other significant points regarding this case. On the basis of previous trying experiences with few UFO films and photographs submitted to the Air Force, and the controversies and complications that later resulted, every effort was made to carry this matter to a firm, final conclusion.

2. Slide was submitted by the UFO Research Council of Cleveland. Our investigation was at North American Aviation Center. This organization has been particularly troublesome since a briefing and interview was granted them by ATIC in January of this year. Briefly, upon still-phasing data at WADC, concerning information on specific cases and requesting group interviews, all correspondence efforts by both this office and the Air Intelligence office has failed to date.

3. Slide purports to show a flying object, disc-shaped and stabilized at 125 feet according to Mr. Donahue, the observer. See attached report.

4. This office immediately prepared both black and white and color prints of flying slides and details as an aid to examination and analysis (representative copies attached).

5. A thorough conference of ATIC photo specialists was held on morning of 8 August 1956 upon request of the undersigned. The following were the prime conference members:

Major R. M. Buchsbaum, Chief, Photo Section
Major W. T. Willner, Chief, Photo Analysis Branch
Mr. L. Le Griffon, Photo Specialist

6. A conference was held at WADC's Technical Photo Division between 0800-0930 hours regarding certain technical reproductive aspects of the film slide. Conference were:

Captain Clements                   Mrs. Lowry
Mr. Hansel                         Mrs. Guthrie

7. To investigate this matter from every possible angle, it was suggested that Dr. Rynex (who resides near the vicinity of Old Greenwich, locally tall with Mr. Rynex, the UFO photographer), to obtain some impressions regarding the source of information on the sightings. (See attached letter from Dr. Rynex).

                                       72209/3263-E

1. The basic request for color prints of UFO has been complied with (see Enclosure No. 2, 2 ea prints approx 3 x 5", and 2 ea prints approx 5½ x 7½").

2. The 5½ x 7½" print was the largest size obtainable with the type of equipment utilized. The magnification for the 3 x 5" print is approximately 13 times; the magnification for the 5½ x 7½" print is approximately 17 times. The grain size of the color film at 17 magnification clearly indicates that further magnification would only be empty and devoid of any additional details.

3. The reproductions indicate that there is a slight possibility that what appears to be an object in space is a small coating defect in the emulsion and/or a tiny particle of chemical substance clinging to the emulsion during processing causing a somewhat erratic reaction.

4. The slide shows numerous physical defects from handling. It is therefore suggested that, prior to further analysis, it be duplicated in order to preserve its possible value to the Center.

8. ATIC photo specialists and undersigned approached the matter
from the viewpoint that the object was either a meteor or the exhaust
of an aircraft in flight. However, microscopic, macroscopic and other
examinations disclosed that the object was the result of a defect in
the film emulsion, probably caused by a chemical reaction during the
film processing. The trail or streak behind the object apparently
resulted. Concurrently, from what is termed a "bromide drag".

9. All three ATIC photo specialists are in agreement as to the
above conclusions.

10. WADC specialists also arrived at the same conclusions, incidentally and without knowledge of ATIC's findings (see para 6 above).

11. The UFO questionnaire which attempted to correlate the sighting with the film mast, therefore, be considered as a deliberate hoax,
with the probability that the source first found the object on the
side, then later prepared a fictitious UFO report to ATIC.

12. This office has reason to believe that this sighting was prearranged to embarrass or show separate possible UFO private organization.

13. Normally, we do not present our specific findings or conclusions to UFO sources or observers. Volume alone would make this an
impossibility. However, it is the opinion of this office that the
probable result of any specific denial by the source would be that this organization is no uncertain terms, short of telling them that the contributor of the film attempted to deliberately perpetrate a hoax on the
Air Force.

14. The recommendations made in the preceding paragraph may serve
to curtail this private UFO organization's constant demand for personal
interviews and UFO investigations. "With regard to the latter, an investigation in June of this year of all sightings submitted to us by
the organization indicated that, with one possible exception, none of
the sightings had merit and, in fact, bordered on the "fantastic" or
"geometric" categories.

15. In keeping with the above recommendations submitted in paragraphs 12 and 13 above, and subject to your approval, attached is a
draft reply to the head of this private UFO organization.

Kelly Saucer

"Not too long ago, I was reading Miss Jacqueline Sauders' article in Gray Barker's The Saucerian Review, under the title 'Panic in Kentucky'. It is an able account of the Hopkinsville, Ky., family who did battle for several hours last summer against some little men from a flying saucer. While I read this dramatic report (being pretty much a critic of such things), a persistent question kept voicing itself in my mind: 'Can this really have happened?' Suddenly in telling how the 'little men' approached the house from a landed saucer, the writer said: 'According to some of the witnesses they were not walking, but 'seemed to float' toward them.' Those words, 'seemed to float' rang a bell. Where had I heard them before: Then I knew! I dug into some of my files and came up with a letter which I had received from one John J. Swaim, a farm boy from near Coldwater, Kansas, who in response to my request, had written me in October, 1954, to tell of an encounter he had had with a 'little man' and a 'saucer' while discising in a field some weeks before. Here is a line taken from his penciled letter: "I came on a terrace. He was crouched behind it. He jumped up and looked at me, and kind of floated. He jumped into the saucer and it lighted up and it took off. It went out of sight... 'Had the folk from near Hopkinsville read John Swaim's description and used it to dress up their own hoax? I very strongly doubt it! To me, this is one of those subtle similarities which make us think twice before saying, 'This story is just a story and nothing more!'

of this little monkey, that appeared like a man, their imaginations ran
away with them and they really did believe what they saw, which they
thought was a little man.

The home that Mrs. _______ lived in was in a very run down condition
and there were about eight people sleeping in two rooms. The window that was
pointed out to be the one that she saw the small silver shining object about
two and a half feet tall, that had its hands on the screen looking in, was a
very low window and a small monkey could put his hands on the top of it while
standing on the ground.

It is felt that the report cannot be substantiated as far as any actual
object appearing in the vicinity at that time.

CAMPBELL AIR FORCE BASE
Fort Campbell, Kentucky

The following statement was given to me by Major John E. Albert on
26 September 1957:

On about August 22, 1955, about 8 A. M., I heard a news broadcast
concerning an incident at Kelly Station, approximately six miles North of
Hopkinsville, Kentucky. At the time I heard this news broadcast, I was at Gracey,
Kentucky on my way to Campbell Air Force Base, where I am assigned for
reserve training. I called the Air Base and asked them if they had heard
anything about an alleged flying saucer report. They stated that they had
not and it was suggested that as long as I was close to the area, that I
should determine if there was anything to this report. I immediately drove
to the scene at [redacted] Station and located the home belonging to a Mrs.
[redacted], who is the one who first reported the incident. (A copy
of Mrs. [redacted]'s statement is attached to this report.)

Deputy Sheriff Batts was at the scene where this supposedly flying
saucer had landed and he could not show any evidence that any object had
landed in the vicinity. There was nothing to show that there was anything to
prove this incident.

Mrs. [redacted] was an impoverished widow woman who had
grown up in this small community just outside of Hopkinsville, with very
little education. She belonged to the Holy Roller Church and the night and
evening of this occurrence, had gone to a religious meeting and she indicated
that the members of the congregation and her two sons and their wives and
some friends of her sons', were also at this religious meeting and were worked
up into a frenzy, becoming very emotionally unbalanced and that after the
religious meeting, they had discussed this article which she had heard about
over the radio and had sent for from the Kingdom Publishers, Fort Worth 1,
Texas and they had sent her this article with a picture which appeared to be
a little man when it actually was a monkey, painted silver. This article had
to be returned to Mrs. [redacted] as she stated it was her property. However,
a copy of the writing is attached to this statement and if it is necessary, a
photograph can be obtained from the above mentioned publishers.

It is my opinion that the report of Mrs. [redacted] or her son
was caused by one of two reasons. Either they actually did see what they
thought was a little man and at the time, there was a circus in the area and a
monkey might have escaped, giving the appearance of a small man. Two,

KELLY INVASION IS WORLD - WIDE LEGEND

The battle of Kelly -- pitting man against creature -- has long since
been won, but it is apparently still being talked and re-fought at all four
corners of the globe.

It has been two years since the now-legendary Martian invasion was
staged in North Christian, but it was only yesterday that Hopkinsville
Police Chief Russell Greenwell received his 150th query into the episode.
This one from Australia.

The writer, Hennrich Shumaker, recently read about the weird visit
by the little green men and is seeking newspaper accounts of the four-
hour gun battle required to repel the reported attack.

The letter is just one of a barrage of inquiries that Chief Green-
well has received since that "awesome" night of Aug. 21, 1955. Similar
letters have been received from curious readers in every state in the
union as well as such foreign countries as France, Mexico and several
South American nations.

The incident received nation-wide publicity shortly after some
"12 or 15 little bug-eyed green men" supposedly landed their space ship
on the Guthrie McBehee farm eight miles north of this city.

Seven persons in the area claimed they waged a four-hour shotgun
and rifle battle with the outer space creatures. City, county, state
and even military authorities were called to the scene to probe the
weird report.

In addition to the letters the police chief has received pamphlets,
magazines and other writings relating to flying saucer stories. One
magazine, "Saucerian Review," published about six months ago, carried a
seven-page article describing the Hopkinsville "encounter" with these
outer space creatures.

The chief said that to this day he, among others, didn't know
whether to believe or disbelieve the story of the little green men and
their space ship. There has been much speculation of this mystery
but nothing factual to prove or disprove the "invasion."

Deputy Sheriff Batts said the men told him that in all they fired up about four boxes of .22 pistol shells. The officer quoted a neighbor saying he hears shooting over at the Suttons but distinguished only about four shots and mistook them for fire-crackers.

Most of the officers remained at the site for more than two hours. During that period there were approximately 25 persons at the scene.

Only excitement during the period the officers were there came when a MP happened to step on a cat's tail while walking in the darkness near the house. The cat let out a squawl and for a few seconds there was much activity and scurrying around on the part of those present.

Two officers who returned to the Kelly area early this morning reported hearing that the "little men" had reappeared around the Sutton home about 3:30 a. m.

Other investigators who went to Kelly later during the morning said they were told Sutton and Taylor had gone to Evansville today.

Officers who visited the scene during last night's excitement were reluctant to express any opinion today in regards to the reported invasion of Kelly. All officials appeared to agree that there was no drinking involved.

Only outspoken comment came from Frank Dudas, city police desk sergeant, who was not on duty last night and has not visited the scene so far. He said, "I think the whole story is entirely possible."

Sergeant Dudas was one of two city policemen who reported seeing three flying saucers early one morning last summer. He said, "I know I saw them. If I saw them, the Kelly story certainly could be true."

Four city police, Chief Russell Greenwell, T. C. Gross, Dorris Francis, and Gray Salter, drove to the scene to see about the "little men". By radio, contact was made with State Trooper R. N. Ferguson, Jr., and G. W. Riley and Deputy Sheriff George Batts, all of whom joined the motorcade to Kelly in their own vehicles. Four M.P.'s also went.

The radio discussions also brought two Hopkins County deputy sheriffs and at least three state troopers from the station at Madisonville.

First arrivers found the scene deserted. The two cars which had brought the report to Hopkinsville did not return to the Kelly farm until after officers had arrived and looked the situation over.

Officers reported they found no tracks of "little men" nor was there any mark indicating anything had landed at the described spot behind the house. There was a hole in the screen at the window through which occupants said a shot had been fired at one of the strange little men.

Both Chief Greenwell and Deputy Sheriff Batts said they got approximately this story from the still terrified and excited Sutton and Taylor families.

About 7 p.m. one of the men went out of the house to get a bucket of water. He saw what looked like a flying saucer come over the trees and land in a field at a point about a city block behind the house. There was no explosion, only a semi-hissing sound, and the watcher returned to the house with the bucket of water.

A short time later somebody reported some little men with big heads and long arms were approaching the house. The men were described as having huge eyes and hands out of proportion to their small bodies. The visitors were wearing what looked to be metal plate.

The men got their guns, a shotgun for Sutton and a .22 caliber target pistol for Taylor. By and by one of the little men pressed his face against the window and the shotgun was fired through the window. The face disappeared.

The men decided to go outside and see if the visitor had been hit. Taylor was in front and when he emerged from the front door, a huge hand reached down from the low roof above the door and grabbed him by the hair. He pulled away, and the two men went on out of the house.

One of the strange little men was in a nearby tree, another on top of the house. A blast from Sutton's shotgun knocked another one of the men down but he did not appear hurt. He disappeared in the darkness.

Taylor reportedly opened fire on other members of the invading party, also with little effect. The battle went on for sometime. When the occupants of the house saw their chance, they jumped onto their cars, and drove to Hopkinsville for help.

STORY OF SPACE-SHIP, 12 LITTLE MEN PROBED TODAY
KELLY FARMHOUSE SCENE OF ALLEGED RAID BY STRANGE CREW
LAST NIGHT: REPORTS SAY BULLETS FAILED TO AFFECT VISITORS

All kinds of investigations were going on today in connection with the bizarre story of how a space-ship carrying 12 to 15 little occupants landed in the Kelly community early last night and battled occupants of a farmhouse.

Most official of the probes was reportedly being staged by the Air Force.

More than a dozen state, county and city officers from Christian and Hopkins counties went to the scene between 11 p. m. and midnight and remained until after 2 a. m. without seeing anything to prove or disprove the story about the ship and its occupants.

The farmhouse is located on the Old Madisonville Road about eight miles north of Hopkinsville. The property is occupied by Cecil (Lucky) Sutton, one of those who reported experiencing last night's phenomena.

There were some 10 or 12 persons at the house, including several children, but investigating officers were not able to determine exactly how many of those present actually claimed to have seen any of the little men from the space ship.

Only other person whom officers quoted directly was identified as Billy Ray Taylor. One account said Taylor is a visitor from Pennsylvania which recently had a similar report of a space ship. Neither Sutton nor Taylor was at home when officers returned to the scene this morning.

The story broke about 11 o'clock last night when two cars, one bearing a Pennsylvania license drove up to Hopkinsville police headquarters. Officers then at the station said the two autos contained at least five adults and several children. All appeared highly excited.

Spokesman for the crowd told of how something resembling a space ship or flying saucer had landed at the back of their house near Kelly and 12 or 15 men, who appeared to be about 4 feet tall, had got out of the ship and come up to the house and done battle with the occupants.

"We need help", one of the men said, "We've been fighting them for nearly four hours".

My name is [redacted] age 50 and I live at [redacted],
Hopkinsville Route 6, Kentucky.

On Sunday night Aug 21, 55 about 10:30 P. M. I was walking through
the hallway which is located in the middle of my house and I looked out
the back door /& saw a bright silver object about two and a half feet tall
appearing round. I became excited and did not look at it long enough to see
if it had any eyes or move. I was about 15 or 20 feet from it. I fell backward,
and then was carried into the bedroom.

My two sons [redacted] age 25 and his wife [redacted] age 29, [redacted]
age 21 and his wife [redacted] age 27 and their friends [redacted] age 21
and his wife [redacted] 18 were all in the house and saw this little man that looked
like a monkey.

About 3:30 A. M. I was in my bedroom and looked out the north window
and saw a small silver shinning object about 2 1/2 feet tall that had its hands
on the screen looking in. I called for my sons and they shot at it and it left.
I was about 60 feet from it this time. I did not see it anymore.

I have read the above statement and it is true to the best of my
knowledge and belief.

It should be an easy task to look back through the newspaper's files covering that period and find the article. The story was altogether too fantastic for even the newspaper to swallow, and they never did give it a very big play as I remember. It died a natural death a few days later, and it never did reach national proportions, and for that matter, it did not, as far as I know, even receive statewide coverage. Furthermore, the story became more exaggerated with each new interview of the farmer and his family.

An interesting sidelight was the fact, told to me by several of the local authorities, that the farmer put up signs at the entrance to his property and was charging $1.00 per head, "to see where the Mars-Men landed".

As for the report that the affair was investigated and reported upon by two Air Force Officers from Campbell Air Force Base, I dont believe that there is any fact in this. I believe that a couple of our officers may have gone down-on their own - to view the place, as I heard some talk of this at the time, but Colonel Donald McPherson, the Base Commander certainly never ordered any official investigation, to the best of my knowledge.

I seem to remember Captain Benjamin Bennett saying something about going down to see the spot, but since he is still stationed there, surely you have already questioned him regarding this matter.

The only other officer who may have looked into this matter was the Deputy Base Commander, Major Ziba B. Ogden, now stationed at Westover Air Force Base. I remember the two of us talking about the incident, and he could possibly have been sent to the scene by Col. McPherson, in an unofficial capacity, without my knowing about it.

Thats about all I recall of the incident. At the time, Col. McPherson figured that there wasn't anything to it, and we all followed suit so to speak. There seemed to be nothing at all in the story that would in any way lead credence to it, so we all promptly forgot it.

In closing, I'd like to point out, that out of all the cases that I investigated for the commander and out of all the incidents that happened around Campbell during my three and a half years there, this incident impressed me the least, and furthermore, I was never even remotely connected with it. It follows then, that my memory concerning this incident is rather faulty and I am not even sure exactly when it took place. Therefore I'm afraid I haven't been of much help, and for this I apologize.

17 September 1957

Dear Kirk:

I just returned from TDY today, and found your letter regarding the alleged "flying saucer" incident that occurred in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on or about 21 August 1955.

I do remember this incident vaguely, but I'm afraid I can't help you much since I was not directly connected with it. That being the case, I am therefore answering your request in this informal manner and the following is, to the best of my knowledge, all that I know about the incident.

Prior to the above incident- several months earlier I believe-we had another "flying saucer" report emanating from the Hopkinsville area. This earlier incident took place on the farm, (just south of Hopkinsville), of a Mr. [redacted] (I think his name was).

Briefly, Mr. [redacted] and a negro handy-man employed by him had observed an unidentified object streak across the sky, perform several abrupt changes of course, and finally disappear in the direction of Bowling Green, Kentucky. They observed this object for several minutes. I think that there was another witness or two present that were guests of Mr. [redacted] at the time. Since Mr. [redacted] was a very prominent citizen of the area, and the senior member of the largest local law-firm, and since the description of the object and its maneuvers was very accurate, some credence was lent to the story. We therefore reported this incident in accordance with AFR 200-2, by Confidential Message.

I mention the above preceding incident, (of which I have personal knowledge since I personally investigated it), because it preceded, to the best of my knowledge, the [redacted] incident. It was not long after the White incident that we heard of the [redacted] incident- perhaps the power of suggestion?

To my knowledge, the [redacted] incident was first investigated, and thoroughly so, by the State Highway Patrol, and later by the Sheriff's Office. The incident was never officially reported to the Air Force. In fact, the first I remember hearing about it is when several persons at Campbell brought to my attention an article about the incident which appeared in the local Hopkinsville paper.

1. This Center requests any factual data, together with pertinent comments regarding an unusual incident reported to have taken place six miles north of Hopkinsville, Kentucky on subject date. Briefly, the incident involved an all night attack on a family named _______ by goblin-like creatures reported to have emerged from a so-called "flying saucer."

2. The Air Force has been informed by reliable sources that an article on this incident may soon appear in a magazine publication, and that the Air Force will be queried regarding its opinion or explanation.

3. Lacking factuals, confirming data, no credence can be given this almost fantastic report. As the incident has never been officially reported to the Air Force, it has not taken official cognizance of the matter. However, two important factors prompt this request:
    a. Previous experience with sensational articles of this type show that almost invariably a large amount of inquiries and allegations against the Air Force soon follow, from both the press and public, and
    b. An unconfirmed report stated that the affair was investigated and reported upon by two Air Force officers from Campbell Air Force Base. This Center, which is responsible for resolving incidents of this nature under provisions of AFR 200-2 "Unidentified Aerial Objects," has no knowledge of such reports.

4. To assist you with respect to any inquiries or investigations, the incident was investigated by the Kentucky State Patrol, the Sheriff's office, and the Hopkinsville Police Department. The Chief of Police at that time was ____________ and is believed to still be in office.

Hopkinsville Case

The Chief of Police in Hopkinsville is ■■■■■■■■. It was he who stated that the Affair was investigated by Air Force officers from Fort Campbell. I understand that MP's and a Pfc from Fort Campbell investigated at the farmhouse on late Monday afternoon.

The Pfc was Mr. Bingham and his account and pictures were published in the Clarksville Tennessee Leaf Chronicle.

Chief ■■■■■■ also stated that the affair had been investigated by two men from an unidentified agency at Standiford Field in Louisville, a commercial field. The Kentucky State Police investigated the case and their report and available sketches are on file with Trooper Riley's case report at Frankfort, Kentucky. Attached is a list of all people concerned in the case.

A Miss Isabelle Davis is preparing a full-scaled report, of which I shall receive a copy, after it has been cross-checked by the people involved.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

You will by now have learned of the accomplishment of the semi-miraculous feat of procuring you a ticket for "My Fair Lady" on July 11th. Hope nothing has come up that will make this date inconvenient for you after all. Good thing you didn't need a pair, for that would have been altogether impossible. No doubt you will be rather disappointed in the show, for I can't see how anything can live up to such popularity as this has achieved.

I certainly hope you will be able to make time to have a schmooze with us, as we have plenty of things to ask, and it goes without saying that we are excited by the alluring suggestions you let fall. It would probably facilitate communication if you dared to put things on paper, but I appreciate the risks you would be taking, and I imagine that your caution is wise. However, it does seem unnecessary and irritating that a situation should exist in which such caution is necessary but as long as scientists have irrational prejudices (which I suppose will be forever), we will always be areas of research that are stigmatised as heretical, and it is no use complaining that scientists ought not to be so anti-scientific. One must recognise that they are, and take appropriate precautions, as you are doing.

I believe you will be interested in Isabel Davis's data on the Hopkinsville landing, which includes two versions, with witness-checked drawings, made by two independent investigators on the day after the event. Thus we learn not only that the case is indubitably "solid" (which Isabel's own investigation established), but also a good deal of information of interest to comparative biologists. Of course, the behaviour of the creatures was disconcertingly weird and incomprehensible, but we are faced with a fact, however much we might wish that it did not exist so markedly from the sort of thing we are accustomed to on this planet. Probably you have not had this information before, as it appears that the Air Force investigators showed little interest in the drawings when offered them; quite probably they "evaluated" the case as a hoax, which is what a biased person would naturally do on superficial examination.

It appears that the little men of Kelly (very evidently, differing from the heavy-set, hairy, muscular little fellows of Venezuela, though identifiable with the ones seen in Georgia and Ohio about the same time (August 21, 1955).) Three feet only in stature, they resembled the conventional "Martian"; spindly in build except for a barrel chest, with small, weak-looking legs and a huge head with enormous eyes. These eyes, yellow-luminous with no visible eyelids or pupils, were set at the sides of the head, as in a rabbit or fish, not frontally as in predators and primates. They were bothered by light, and could be driven off with a flashlight beam, clear evi-

Dear Captain:

I had hoped until the last minute that you would be able to make it here for a conference---since now it appears that you cannot I'd better set down on paper a few of the things that I long had in mind to discuss with you. As it is, it won't be all, but the rest will have to wait until next month. I leave for California tomorrow, and I have a lot of last minute things to get off.

First, I had been meaning to tell you for a long while that shortly after I left ATIC I saw the light on the Donahue case. I realized suddenly that the 9th had been taken with a small lens---consequently, any object as bright as it appeared on the film must have been spectacular in the sky. That is, to obtain so brilliant an image implies that an object in the sky would have had to been truly spectacular. This would have been noticed by a great many people---and, further, it doesn't jibe at all with Donahue's description of the object as starlike. No star could have produced so bright an image. Consequently either the deception of the whole object was wrong or the whole thing is a hoax. I strongly leaned to the latter hypothesis, and just yesterday I learned from Miss Hoover that you had also come to the conclusion by other means that the thing was a hoax. Why will people persist in being idiots? What can they hope to gain?

dence that strong sunlight is not encountered on their planet, or that their
habit of life is exclusively nocturnal. One of the hard-to-believe features
of the case is that bullets (from a shotgun and a .22 pistol), fired by good
marksmen at short range, seemed to discommode them little more than flash-
light beams; no blood flowed, and no harm seemed to be done other than a
temporary discomfiture. (Of course-and this is a point that just occurred
to me--an obvious experiment was not carried out; no one thought to try a
silver bullet). Another incredible point, psychologically this time, is that
in spite of receiving a very obviously hostile reception, they persisted for
hours in besieging the farmhouse, even coming up to the screened windows and
putting their hands upon the screen.

These hands, borne on arms so long that they almost reached
the ground, were large, clawed, and webbed. There can be no doubt about this,
because of the behavioural mentioned, above, which gave at least some of the wit-
nesses an excellent view of the organs in question. Moreover, the beings were
not fully bipedal, and seemed to prefer to use their hands in locomotion, after
the fashion of chimpanzees. One account says they had no thumbs--this again
is almost incredible.

(Suggesting a thin atmosphere, &/or descent from a herbivore rather than a
predatory carnivore.) One account says that when they were shouted at (which
probably was painful) to their ears), their silvery luminosity increased. Yes,
they were luminous (like many terrane animals), though not greenish, as the
newspapers had it. Only the yellow glow (innate, or reflection)? of the
great eyes had a greenish cast.

The drawings all depict an apparently nude creature (lacking
sexual organs, however); but the skin appeared metallic, so that some close-
fitting garment may have been worn.

The feet were not like ours. One account says they resembled
suction cups. They were not well seen, because they were mostly in the grass.

It is certain that the creatures can counteract gravitation.
All noted how they "floated" or "bounced" along, much as we do under water.
Thus their ability to leap into trees, or onto the roof, does not imply power-
ful muscles and a large home planet. The Venezuelan hominids, on the other
hand, appeared to be well-muscled in their own right.

The mouth was a wide slit. The nose is uncertain. The cranium
was formidable, and totally bald. They uttered no sound.

They appeared resolutely pacific in intention. When approaching
the house they generally raised their arms in the air, though this was apparently
a rather unnatural posture for them. (I can well imagine, though, that the
effect was alarming, though one supposes that it was meant as a signal of peace-
ful intentions.) Once one was on a little roof over the door when one of the
men struck his head out. The being did not take a poke at him, or even pull his
hair. He patted his head, as one would a dog's. This was after he had been
shot at for some time.

Well, perhaps I should not have set forth all this; it may be
beyond your tolerance level, and might even injure our reputation for good sense
to a disastrous degree. But I regard this information as the most substantial
advance that has been made in saucer research recently (the most important pre-
vious contribution was the radar data) and cannot help being somewhat enthusias-
tic over it. (Hopkinsville data previously on record were not nearly so de-
tailed as this, and bear in mind that this was obtained immediately after the even

Isabel Davis will hold forth upon all this (and upon her interviews with Chief Greenwell, who is now a member of G.S.I.v, and the other Hopkinsville people) on the evening of the 9th, at my place (see Newsletter for details.) Probably you can't manage to make this, which may be just as well, as incognito would be difficult, and some of our less laudable members will doubtless be present. She'll tell you all you want to know when we meet, but allow plenty of time if you would like a complete account of the matter.

She spent a week there and used her time well.

We're delighted to hear that the Bluebook crown has passed to another head, and a sensible one; perhaps something can be done in the near future to dispel the miasma of suspicion created by the Air Force's bias, secrecy, and prevarications of the past. (Though will it ever be possible to get them to admit the reality of such things as I have just described?) Well, we need not insist on that.)

The Colorado Springs case, which I gather you have personally investigated, sounds exactly like the Lubbock lights (pardon this statement of the obvious), and we hope you'll be able to explain Ruppelt's mysterious concluding remarks about phenomena of this sort. That they differ from "ordinary" flying saucers seems likely, and I would be delighted if they can be "cooked" in some way. If so, it will have to be an ingenious way.

Getting around rather late to one of the points raised in your letter, let me say that we fully agree with your criticism of Michel's version of the Mentell case. It is clear all right, but it is not accurate. After all, it is nothing but an imaginative reworking of Keyhoe's data. Perceiving that the thing was a hopeless tangle past sorting out, we simply added a footnote "Michel's version of this celebrated case should be compared with that given by Ruppelt, &c. &c.", and let it go at that. Then the publisher, not caring for this implied criticism, simply deleted the footnote, and there you are. As a matter of fact, there are many things in Michel's book that we do not endorse.

The book was rushed to press with our editing only half done, because the publisher said time pressed and the changes were becoming too expensive. The index was a rush order, only one night allowed; result, many careless omissions, such as Bouffoux and Cape of Good Hope. Then the publisher changed the pagination slightly, and threw many of the references out by one page. It is our impression that publishers are principally interested in printing something; they don't seem to be much concerned about the quality of what they print.

Still, I suppose we shouldn't complain; even being allowed to half-revise it was better than nothing, though it leaves us in the exasperating position of coming to be responsible for many things which we had no opportunity to correct. (I cringe at the crass confusion of "parhelion" with "parhelic circle" on p. 48; I patched this up in Part 3, but Part 1 was Todd's and he didn't catch the error. The Chermanne Bouffoux photograph, which so impressed the correspondent, is patently a fake, undoubtedly, is the Taormina picture used on the cover. On the other hand, the Fregnale photograph is genuine, and we had a detailed account of it, which the publisher refused to insert. Most of the illustrations are nonsensical and should have been left out. Etc., etc.--too tedious to itemize.)--but I must mention that we don't approve of the wrong labelling of the so-called "horizon" ray in the mirage diagrams, and I see that R. W. Wood is against me in the matter of magnification by Pata Morgana, though I intend to repeat the experiment and see for myself, nonetheless, these diagrams are a big improvement on Michel's originals.

I agree with your disappointment in the UFO film; it is far from an honest documentary.

Thanks very much for taking time to write, and hope to see you in the

CIVILIAN SAUCER INTELLIGENCE OF NEW YORK

Public Meeting of April 28, 1956

Pythian Temple, 135 West 70th Street, New York City

Speaker: FRANK EDWARDS

The meeting was opened by A. D. Mbane, Secretary-Treasurer. Before introducing Frank Edwards, the speaker of the evening, he described briefly the history and present status of C.S.I. of N.Y. (now two years old, it has reached a membership of 100), and directed the audience's attention to the wall display of enlarged pages from Project Blue Book Note. 14, with critical commentary by the C.S.I. Research Section.

Frank Edwards' career in broadcasting has spanned virtually the entire history of electronic communication. An aviator in the early 1920s, he became one of the first radio announcers in 1923, and has been "on the air" ever since. From 1949 until August 1954, as the news commentator of the American Federation of Labor on the Mutual network, he was heard by millions. His broadcasts then were closely followed by all aficionados of Unidentified Flying Objects, who knew he could be depended on to give a full and fair account of events that would never appear in the newspapers. At the time of his abrupt departure from the AFL program -- because of his refusal to submit to censorship -- he was probably the country's best-known exponent of the reality of flying saucers. Since that time he has been appearing daily on television station WTW in Indianapolis, where he has continued to bring to the public the facts about UFOs.

Surprisingly enough, although radio and television have brought him such renown in the field of flying-saucer investigation, his talk this evening was his first in-person public lecture on the topic.

One chapter of Frank Edwards' autobiography, My First Ten Million Sponsors, published by Ballantine, is devoted to the flying saucer story, and is one of the best short treatments of the subject that has yet appeared.

A summary of Mr. Edwards' lecture follows.

FLYING SAUCERS -- IN, ON, AND OFF THE AIR

(Condensation of a talk by Frank Edwards before C.S.I. of N.Y.)

Before we get into this, I'd like to say that I don't profess to be an expert on flying saucers. I don't know any experts on flying saucers. I'm a reporter. I've dealt with this subject just as I've dealt with many others, some of which were just as complex, confusing, and aggravating. I've dealt with it from the standpoint of a reporter who has found a very interesting story.

My interest in this field goes back a good many years. Back in the early '20s, when I was just a kid, I used to fly an old Jenny 4 biplane with a 90-horsepower engine and a wooden propeller -- a crate, as they called them. I was a little short then, and had to sit on a sack of oats so I could see out the cockpit. One night I was in the office of an outfit known as the "Gates Flying Service," for which I was flying at the time, and Bert Acosta, the famous aviator, was there. He was telling about something that had happened to him in

Colorado the preceding year --that would be 1922 or 1923. Two or three things that looked like "flying manhols covers" had come up to his plane and flown around it. He said these things were about 3 or 4 feet in diameter and perhaps 6 inches thick. He couldn't see what kept them in the air, but they had no difficulty at all in circling his plane. One of them even came in behind his wing and came within about 10 feet of him before all three or then dropped away and were lost to view. He said he'd never seen anything like it in all his years of flying. Then a couple of the other pilots spoke up and said that they had seen similar things, some larger than that, and some about the same size. They finally decided that they were probably "just go-devils." I never did get around to finding out what these "go-devils" were; but I have a hunch that they were what we now call flying saucers.

A few years after that, on August 5, 1926, there was a sighting by Nicholas Roerlch in the Himalaya; the expedition members watched a shiny disk-shaped object, which seemed metallic, through binoculars. And this thing, too, was apparently what we call today a flying saucer.

Of course, you folks who have delved into this subject know that these things are not of recent vintage --they have been seen over a long, long period of time. But it wasn't until June, 1947, that the big flying-saucer story broke. I was on the air out in Indiana then, and remember it well. Actually, the story ought to have broken on June 23rd. On that day, a railroad engineer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was getting down from his engine when he noticed two silvery disk-shaped objects flying in a string. "Like wild geese", as he said. He called the newspapers and told them what he had seen; he said he had never seen anything like it in the air, and he felt certain that they were not birds or balloons (or, I suppose, hallucinations), and he estimated that they were flying at about 1000 miles an hour. But that story only got five or six lines on the news wires, because newspapers do not regard railroad engineers as authoritative witnesses on overhead phenomena.

But, the next day, the 24th, when Kenneth Arnold saw nine things flying in the same fashion, that was a different story, because there the observer was a veteran flyer. a friend of mine, incidentally, and I have a high regard for him. He knew what he was seeing --or at least he could describe it intelligently-- and he made the headlines, as you know, from coast to coast. After that, things were seen all over this country, and eventually all over the world.

By the summer of 1948, some friends of mine up in Alaska were writing to me to say that they were seeing some very strange things in the sky up there. I had flown in Alaska quite a bit in years gone by, and in the summer of 1948 I went up there again to talk to these people about what they had seen, and to look at some pictures they had taken. Unfortunately they turned out to be very poor pictures-- really just smears, but I had some very interesting discussions with people I knew, whom I regarded as credible witnesses. I also met, of course, a lot of people whom I did not know and for whose credibility I couldn't vouch. But they all told pretty much the same story; they were all seeing the same type of objects. A couple of jet pilots from Elmendorf Air Base, whom I met accidentally, had a particularly impressive story to tell. One day in April they were flying over the Brooks Range, under a thin layer of cloud or ice crystals at about 30,000 feet, when they noticed a long shadow, "like a gigantic fish or a zeppelin", cast from above on this layer. They decided that they'd go up and take a look at it. They told me that when they came out on top of the overcast, they found themselves only about a quarter of a mile behind the thing. It looked, they said, like a B-29 fuselage with no tail and no wings; there was some flame coming out the back end of it; and it was moving at a speed of about 1000 mph. They saw no windows.

they saw no apertures of any kind, they saw no antennas --in fact, they saw nothing except a cigar-shaped moving object. One of them had some fuel to spare, and he decided to follow the thing. But just as he started to take out after it, a stream of orange flame, which they estimated to be 60 to 100 feet long, shot out of the rear end of the object, and it accelerated rapidly, and ran off and left those jets as if they were tied to a stump. They estimated that the thing must have triple-did its speed in a matter of about 15 seconds. As near as they could tell, it was going about 1000-1200 mph when they last saw it, and it was climbing rapidly.

They got back to base and reported what they had seen. They were immediately confined to quarters, and they were subjected to all sorts of grilling for about 5 days. In fact, they both assured me that one of them was not allowed to sleep for 72 hours. After that, they passed the word around among the other boys: "If you see anything weird up there, keep your mouth shut, and save yourself a lot of trouble."

On the day I left Alaska, two Air Force Intelligence men came to see me. They understood that I was interested in this subject (it certainly hadn't been any secret). They just wanted to know if they could help me -- if there was anything I'd like to know. Well, I asked them the usual questions and I got the usual runaround. But then they let down their hair and told me --confidentially-- that those things were very real. --secret developments. Could I tell people that? "Of course --unfortunately, you can tell them that. Don't tell them that we said this --but we had these things timed to break just before Congress took up the military appropriations last year." Well, I shocked on that when I got back, and sure enough, that's just when the story did break. For quite a while, I thought those Air Force men had told me the truth. But I don't think so any more.

If the saucers are ours, we've certainly wasted billions of dollars in the nine years since 1947 building airplanes that can't come close to the things. I don't think they are ours, and I don't think they are anybody else's on this earth.

I believe that these things are real. I believe that they are very substantial; and I believe what my group of the Navy's top physicists have said to me in writing, in documents which I have in my look box where snoopers can't get their hands on them. I believe that these things are, in the words of these physicists, "unconventional and exceedingly high-speed devices, created and operated by intelligent being of a high order, which do not originate on this planet."

To show you just how solid the people are who made that statement, I'd like to go back to one day in October 1955, when Major Keyhoe and I were on a television program called "Author Meets The Critics", debating flying saucers with Willy Ley, the famous German writer on rockets and other scientific matters. About halfway through the show, I leaned over to Mr. Ley, who had been expressing his skepticism about the whole thing, and I said, "Mr. Ley, I would like to show you a letter that I have with me. I am not permitted to read the full contents of the letter to you, but I would like to show you the heading and the signatures, and I would like to read you two sentences from the letter."

I showed him the heading --a very important center for the government's super-secret activities-- and I showed him the signatures -- all well-known physicists-- and I read this:

"After six years of analyzing the evidence submitted to us by the U.S. government and other agencies, we have come to the unanimous conclusion that the objects known as flying saucers do not originate on this earth, and that they possess ca-

pabilities far beyond any earth-made craft. We also believe that these flying saucers, as they are called, are operated by intelligent beings of an extremely high order."

Well, that took all the wind out of Mr. Ley's sails. He spent the rest of the debate not contesting the matter at all, but asking questions of Major Keyhoe and myself in order to find out more about the subject. The lady who moderated the show kept trying to needle Mr. Ley to try and stir up a little argument, but all the argument was out of him.

I appeared on a film show with him about six months ago, in which Willy very carefully asked around the edges of the subject. I think he was afraid I still had "letter in my pocket."

Now here's an odd thing about that "Author Meets The Critics" broadcast. Although the program was on the Dumont network, it was carried by just one station, right here in New York City. The network didn't cancel the program altogether, but for some reason, which was never explained, it took the program off every other one of its stations.

In the winter of 1949, I was broadcasting every night over the Mutual network from Indianapolis. One night in December, a package came in for me off the other announcers. He opened it up, and it was a rough copy of True magazine, with a lead article by Major Donald Keyhoe called "The Flying Saucers Are Real." Actually, I tried to get him to use the story right away. I had only a few hours before I went on the air, so I called Ken Purdy, the editor, in Irvine, Connecticut, and got him out of bed. I had a hard time getting his agreement, because he'd already made arrangements with Walter Winchell, but I insisted until he said "Go ahead." I broke the story, and it made the news wires the next day all over the country.

That was the first really good article I had over read on the flying saucers. I have a very high regard for Major Keyhoe. He has done a wonderful job of research and reporting on this subject.

In January, 1950, I came to Washington. As you will remember, there were a great many saucer sightings at that time. I covered them; no one raised any objection, because when I went with the AFL I had a specific understanding with Mr. William Groon, the president of the AFL, and a very fine old gentleman. He told me, "We know how you operate, and we just want you to do the same kind of job on the network that you have done before. We want you to get the idea across that the AFL is just a cross-section of the American people. Provided you do that, we'll never interfere with you." As long as Mr. Groon lived, that was the basis on which we operated. I didn't devote a great deal of time to flying saucers-- I didn't bother with observations that were just repetitions of earlier ones-- as a matter of fact, I used only about three percent of my broadcast time reporting flying saucers. But when an exceptional story came along, I was free to devote a minute or so to it. And if I thought it was worth it. And apparently it was, partly because that was one of the things that helped us, in about two years, to take that program, which amounted to nothing when I went on it, to the point where it was one of the three top programs on nighttime radio.

In the summer of 1952 I was in Washington when flying saucers began circling the nation's capital. Now, prior to that time there had not been a great deal of official secrecy. Of course, there had been some attempts to deceive you or "can you around", and convince you that all these people who saw UFOs were a little

off their rockers, or had spots on their spectacles -- you got a good deal of
that. But at the same time you could go over to the Pentagon almost whenever
you liked and go in to see General Sory Smith, or Major Dewey Fournet, or some
of those other fellows who were level-headed and in positions of responsibility.
You could go in and ask them questions, you could request to see sighting reports
that had come in, you could generally look at the photographs, and if you asked
about the movies that they had, they'd probably let you see them. Of course, you
might not be allowed "to take them out", and they might ask you not to say anything
about it just now, "because we haven't reached a decision on it". I always
respected those requests, because in the long run it was a good, sensible way to
operate for both parties.

But after those remarkable sightings in July 1952, when these things came in
and circled the National Airport - when they circled the White House and the
Washington Monument, and the Capitol, and were seen simultaneously both visually
and on radar -- the tune at the Pentagon changed overnight. In my book I've itemized some of those sightings. I can't remember offhand the number of those
things that were seen, but they were some in quantity. Then all of a sudden there
was nothing more about them in the papers. The last important sighting there in
Washington that made the newspapers was the night, I think, of July 28th. On that
day the Air Force ordered jet pilots to shoot these things down. I found out
about this order from a friend of mine at Andrews Field, where jets were armed and
ready 2½ hours a day, and I put it on the air that same night. It created quite a
stir. Many top scientists -- I understand that Einstein and Grey and Langmuir were
among them -- called the White House and the Pentagon and urged that they rescind
that order immediately. Their thinking was that if these things were able to perform as reported, then the greatest threat to our national security would probably well able to take care of themselves, and that if we started any shooting
with them just out of curiosity, when there hadn't been any hostilities on
their part, we might be starting something that we couldn't finish. And on the
afternoon of the 29th the White House called off the order.

That night there was an alert all up and down the east coast. A gigantic
object, about 1000 feet in diameter, had come in over the Atlantic at an altitude
of at least 60,000 feet; it had gone across New Jersey, part of Pennsylvania,
turned down across West Virginia, back across Delaware, and had gone back toward
the ocean some distance north of Washington. The jets were ready to go at a
moment's notice, but they were not sent up. It was no use sending them up, because
they couldn't get up that high. This thing, whatever it was, was tracked with
radar continuously from the time it came in off the ocean and started over the
land. What it was I don't know, but I do know it was up there and that our jets
were ready to take off if it ever got low enough for them to reach.

And immediately following these dramatic and rather alarming sightings over
the nation's capital, the policy of secrecy and deception, which seems to have
been adopted to continuously by the Air Force ever since, was put into effect.
I didn't know myself until last year, when I came into possession of a government
document, that on August 13th of that same year, just about two weeks after the
sightings which made so many headlines, 58 of these things came over Washington
in one night in a two-and-a-half-hour period. They followed airplanes in and
around the airport; they flew in formation up and down between National Airport
and Andrews Field; they flew at low altitude over the White House and around some
of the other buildings. They were seen visually by quite a few people, and they
were of course tracked on radar as they came in, as they manoeuvred around, and as
they left. Not one word of it got into the papers. It was one of the best-kept
secrets of the year. I finally found the record of it in a document issued in September, 1952 by the Civil Aeronautics Authority -- Technical Development Report

No. 130. This is a 28-page booklet that tries to give the impression that the sightings can all be explained away. It has numerous diagrams showing how the "blips" behaved on the radar scopes, and a double-page spread tabulating the sighting reports. The case I've just mentioned is briefly summarized in that table.

An interesting thing about that G.A.A. booklet -- it points out that one of the radar sightings could be explained pretty well if one were a lot of small, sharply defined radar mirrors or some kind floating with the wind at the height of the inversion layer. Of course, what natural phenomenon would produce these radar mirrors is something they can't answer. But then they go on and list more than a dozen more sightings, and anyone who looks at these closely will discover that their theory breaks down completely. For at least half of them, there was no inversion present at all then the objects came over. But you have to spot this for yourself, because the authors keep quiet about it.

On June 1, 1954, the Air Force put out a false statement that there had been only 87 sightings reported in five months. All the news services carried it, without making any effort to check it. To put it politely, it was an informal lie. I knew it was a lie, because I had furnished them 127 sightings myself. (I was getting them at that time at the rate of 100 a week.) I got in touch with Len Stringfield of Cincinnati, who publishes a little magazine on this subject called Orbit, as many of you probably know. Stringfield is a very competent man, and he's done an excellent job of editing his publication. When I called him, he got in touch with Lt.-Col. John O'Mara, of the Air Force Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Field, in Dayton, Ohio. (Wright-Patterson has always been the center of all activity dealing with the UFOs, though they like to change the name of the project from time to time, to keep the public in the dark.) I suppose. In June, 1954, they were calling it Project Blue Book.) When Col. O'Mara was asked how the sightings were coming in, he replied, "This is the biggest year we've ever had; we're getting 700 a week." At least, that's what he reported to have said. He evidently didn't know that his bosses in Washington had put out that statement about 87 reports in five months. I used O'Mara's statement that night, and to put it mildly, it created a bit of a rumor over at the Pentagon.

Then you're vulnerable, as I was, and exposed to pressure, as I was, it does not do you any good in the long run to stir up the Air Force and some of the other departments of the government, as I found out; but I believe if I had it to do over again I'd probably do the same thing, because I'm a little hard-headed about things like that.

By this time George Meaney had become the president of the AFL, and things were different from what they had been under Mr. Green. The AFL had put a censor on me. They called him an assistant, but I'd been in the news business for 32 years, and I recognized a censor when I saw one. Every month, the program's ratings were growing, but I realized that I was coming to the end of my strings. Finally, on August 3, 1954, they issued an order notifying me that I must say what the censor told me to say, exactly as he told me to say it. Well, if the censor was going to write the program, they didn't need me any more. So I asked them to relieve me of my duties at the end of the current period. Instead of that, they fired me. And Mr. Meaney issued two amazing statements. In one he said, "We were deluged with flying saucer mail, and we were not particularly interested in that." The other thing he said was that I was "too pro-labor." Well, perhaps, compared to him, that was true. I'm an AFL member myself, I have been one for a great many years, and I believe in the principles of trade unionism, like my father and grandfather.

But as to his being deluged with flying saucer mail, I can only say to you that it was one of the smallest deluges in history. I asked my audience one night if they wanted me to continue reporting on flying saucer sightings, because it was becoming difficult, the wire services wouldn't carry then any more, and I thought maybe interested had lagged. I got over 5000 letters - addressed to me personally, and delivered to me at the Mutual studios, more than a mile from Mr. Meany's office. At the AFL building, in my office, all that came in was 2 letters and 12 postcards. I guess this must have been the "deluge" that Mr. Meany complained of. He said also that "we were not particularly interested in flying saucers." That's peculiar too, because, only about two months before, the AFL newspaper had run a special article on Flying saucers, which I wrote at the request of Mr. George Meany, who is listed as the editor of the thing.

Well, the truth is that flying saucers really had nothing at all to do with my exit from the AFL's radio program, as those of you who have read my book will agree. They just provided a convenient peg on which Mr. Meany could hang his statement of dismissal. I'm sure that there were some other reasons why Mr. Meany was so anxious to get me out of the picture, and I have the facts on that set down in my book. It was something far more --maybe I'd better leave the word alone-- I wanted to say reprehensible, and maybe it is reprehensible-- I'll let you read the book and decide for yourself.

Actually, the fellow did me a favor. There were only three nighttime radio programs that were growing at that time --TV was murdering the rest. Due to the fact that we were doing an unusual type of program, I happened to have one of the three. But I was working 12 to 14 hours a day to get the job done; I had to cover a lot of radio territory to get the stories, and it was wearing me down; and while I was very displeased that we had to have such a rumpus when we came to the parting of ways, in the long run it was probably a good thing. I'm certainly a lot happier now doing my television show at WTV. There are no strings attached to anything I say; I decide what I'm going to use, and how I'm going to use it.

Let me tell you now about a couple of the most important flying-saucer cases that have come up since I've been at WTV. .... HOPKINSVILLE CASE ....

The first is a very strange thing that happened on August 21st, last year, near Hopkinsville, Kentucky. It made headlines in the newspapers out there, and for once it was carried by the press wires --I suppose just because they thought it was ridiculous. You may remember reading the wire story about "little green men" --actually they weren't green, some rewrite man put that in because he thought they ought to be green.

In the middle of the night eleven people rushed from a farmhouse in the little village of Kelly, 8 miles north of Hopkinsville, to get police protection against goblin-like creatures from a flying saucer, who had been besieging them for three hours. Shortly after sunset, one of the men had seen a saucer come down in a field behind the house. Soon afterwards, they saw some creature coming toward the house. As it came closer, they saw it was something like a little man, about 3 feet tall, with a huge head, and enormous glowing eyes. The long arms hung almost to the ground, and its big hands had long claws on the fingers. Its body had a notable appearance, and glowed in the dark. When they saw this thing, the men went for their guns --a shotgun and a .22 rifle. For three hours these little creatures kept coming up to the house, and the men kept shooting at them, apparently with no effect. Some of the creatures were shot at a range of twenty feet or less, but they never seemed to be wounded; it merely discouraged them for a few minutes. Finally, about 11 o'clock, the terrified family piled into two cars and

raced to the Hopkinsville police station. The police came in force, and they
searched all round the house: there was nothing to be found. No blood, no bodies,
no footprints. But the family was in a state of terror, and was certainly
no evidence of drinking. The police finally left, and an hour after they had gone
the little goblins were back again. Mrs. Glemis Lankford, lying in bed, at one
time watched one through the window for several minutes. Before dawn, they had
gone, but not until more shots had been fired. Seven of the eight adults in the
house saw one or more of the little beings at one time or another.

I was in Mt. Vernon, Indiana, only about 50 miles away, when this story hit
the newspapers. The Evansville Courier-Press of August 22nd printed a detailed
account of it, with a drawing of one of the little men, based on the description
given by the witnesses -- weird-looking little creatures. Since a member of my
family was dying, I couldn't leave at the time, so it was three days before I got
there.

And when I did get to Hopkinsville, I walked into a practical joke, which is
one of the things you have to watch out for when you're trying to investigate sub-
jects like this. A couple of newspaper men I'd once played jokes on wanted to
a good deal of trouble to revenge themselves, they arranged an interview with a
phony "witness" who told me a lot of inaccurate and invented details. And he
tried to sell me a plater cast which he said had been made from a footprint of
one of the creatures. If I'd bought it, their own would have bubbled over. As it
was, it took me some time to catch on.

The funny thing about this is that the hoaxers were telling an essentially
true story, though I'm sure they didn't realize this themselves. Their plaster
cast was a fake, but the Kelly landing really did happen. Nobody has ever been
able to explain it away. 1/

Another thing that they told me was not true of the Kelly case, but it was
true, as we both know, of another outstanding saucer-landing case, that of the
so-called "Flatwoods Monster" seen at Sutton, West Virginia on September 12, 1952.
Two or three days after that happened, a couple of "aluminum-ware salesmen" had
come around, who had stayed for about three hours not telling aluminum-ware, but
questioning the witnesses about the strange experience they had had. The next
day a fellow came along selling subscriptions to a magazine that is printed in
Augusta, Maine, and he worked the neighborhood over, questioning everybody
who had reported anything. The few people who ordered the aluminum-ware or sub-
scribed to the magazine got their money back a couple of weeks later with no let-
ter of explanation at all. I leave to your imagination what agency was probably
behind these shenanigans.

Well, the Kelly case had its comic aspects --and part of the joke was on me--
but there was nothing humorous about the second important case that I've had per-
sonal contact with in recent months. This one was a tragedy.

On January 8th of this year, at Bedford, Indiana, about 50 miles south of In-
dianapolis, the GOC spotted five flying saucers at one time, circling around. They
had been reported over Lafayette, Indiana, about 90 miles to the west, just a
short time before, and then they were seen south of Bedford, where they were watch-
ed by three or four hundred people. The farmers were calling each other back and

b. Black and white prints disclose two faint smudges in front of the point of the object. One is directly in front and about the same length in size of the object proper. The second is smaller and slightly below, curving downward. Microscopic examination indicates these two markings are not part of the background but appear to be part of the same material as the object itself.

c. Microscopic examination (100X-250X) of both the original photo and the print discloses that the "nuclei" or white spot in the center of the object was caused by a defect or a flaw in the film. There are sharply defined edges to the nuclei, and the white spot is actually formed by four, clearly defined and almost square chemical particles of abnormal emulsion grain. The trail in this area is commonly referred to as a "burnout drag" in photo terminology.

d. The apparent movement of the object photographed in flight, would result in the outline of sharply defined edges appearing as elliptical or elongated in shape.

e. This spot or flaw may have been caused from either a defect in the original film or through microscopic chemical deposits that remained in that particular spot during the processing of the film.

In all cases where photography is involved in UFO reports, every attempt is made to correlate the data submitted to the Memorandum with the film or photographs. In this respect, there are certain inconsistencies in the report submitted to us.

f. Assuming that Kodachrome film and the fastest shutter speed was used (Kodak Pony, 1/300 sec.) photographing the object, no size even from an assumed short distance away (one-half mile) would be highly improbable. That a dark trail would be recorded on the film at that distance.

g. The transparency indicates that the object is almost perfectly centered. It would appear that it would be very difficult to quickly locate such a small, fast-moving object in the camera, viewfinder, and then against a dark sky.

h. The object is reported as being the size of a ball of pipe which would make its diameter almost impossible to venture an opinion as to details or construction, yet the observer's statement of its possible size and construction is given as a disc-shaped object, positioned or light metal and about 150 feet in diameter.

forth on the fence wire, and when anybody picked up the phone everybody else was listening, so they were really broadcasting everything that was going on. The objects followed the usual pattern --disk-shaped, about 25 feet in diameter, glowing and changing color from faint orange to yellow and to gray. They went from Louisiana up to chase them, but as soon as the jets got within 15 or 20 miles the objects took off, going northward, and left there at a high speed and disappeared at great altitude in a matter of seconds.

Three weeks later, on January 31st, just before I went on the air, I got a call from our Bloomington studio. They said, "We've got a picture for you of the wrecks of a National Guard plane that crashed down here this afternoon between Bloomington and Bedford. The pilot was killed." It turned out that the pilot was a fellow whom I happened to know, Col. Lee Merkel, a veteran flyer and a wonderful guy.

The following day I discovered, through a friend of mine in Louisville, that the jets had been up again unidentified objects just as on the 8th, and again the jets had lost them. But Col. Merkel, who was in charge of the National Guard air base down at Louisville, had taken off in a P-51 Mustang, a propeller-driven job. He had oxygen tanks, and the plane was in excellent condition. He had gone up because he could fly longer than the jets, and the jets were trying to vector him in on the UFOs. Finally he reported back to the tower at Louisville, by radio, that he could see an object moving along the edge of a cloud some distance ahead of him and above him, and he took after it. According to the reports he made to the tower, it was climbing, but he was following it. He gave no description of it, other than to say that he could see it glowing and blinking. When he got about 30,000 feet, he said he thought he was gaining a little on it, and it was then below him, and he was going to move in on it. Then they heard no more from him. A few minutes later, his plane exploded at low altitude --apparently at about 500 feet. Eight above, a farmhouse, and the plane was scattered all over the fields for a quarter of a mile. It was a terrific blast. I find it hard to believe that the explosion of the plane's gasoline, in those thin aluminum tanks, could possibly have had that much power.

I'm inclined to think that we have here a repetition of the tragedy of Capt. Thomas Mantell, who was killed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in January, 1948, while he was chasing one of these unidentified objects --one of the celebrated cases, as those of you who are familiar with this subject know. I think that after eight years, just a bit north of the original spot, we've had another incident of the same kind.

It never made the papers. On November 11, 1954, an unknown object had appeared in the very same area, and Col. Merkel had chased it --unsuccessfully. That made front-page headlines in Louisville. But when Merkel died, fourteen months later, on a similar mission, not a paper mentioned that he had been chasing something when his plane mysteriously crashed.

Mr. Edwards' talk was followed by a discussion period, in which he answered questions from the audience. Nearly all of these questions and answers, in a somewhat condensed form, are given below.

Q - Is there any evidence that any of these objects have crashed?
A - I'm not too sure that some of them haven't. Way back in 1947, at Roswell,

New Mexico, a farmer reported that he saw something strike a mountainside and crash. According to what I was told, they threw troops in a circle all around that place, and would let nobody in for five days. Finally they came up with a picture of a man holding a little crumpled kite with aluminum foil on it-- a radar target-- and they said this was it. "Below it or not. There have been many other rumors since then of saucers having crashed. I don't know whether there's any truth in them.

Q - Why don't they crash more often, since they are seen so frequently?

A - Dr. Hermann Oberth, the father of the German Rocket Society, and certainly one of the world's great rocket scientists, said, one day last year: "I am confident that they operate by distorting the gravitational field." Nine days later Dr. Oberth was brought to this country and sent to the Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, Alabama, to work for the U. S. Government; he hasn't made any more public statements. But I've had other physicists tell me the same things-- that they think these things operate by counteracting the gravitational field. If that proves to be correct, then it would be impossible for them to fall, because they would not be subject to the law of gravity. Of course, they might still collide with something. I have a feeling that has probably happened sometimes, but it's one of those things you certainly wouldn't find out if there was any way for the government to keep you from finding out.

Q - Why doesn't the government want people to know about this?

A - I suspect they're afraid of hysteria. There was an example of that, you know, in that 1938 broadcast of Orson Welles. I'll have to admit that I was one of those who were panicked by that thing. I was sound asleep and my wife came dashing in and waked me up, and she said, "For God's sake listen to this --something is invading New Jersey and St. Louis, and everything else." I jumped up and listened, and I couldn't believe that a network would fake a news show, so I grabbed the phone and called WBAS, and fortunately I got hold of an engineer there whom I knew, and he said, "Oh, take it easy, this is just a dramatization of Wells' 'War Of The Worlds', and we're catching you know what about it!"

Q - How is the government able to keep saucer sightings quiet?

A - There are only three press services, and they are all dependent on the Pentagon and other government agencies for their big stories, so it's very easy to bribe them into silence -- or "enlist their co-operation". Anyone who gets out of line won't get any more scoops.

Q - Have there been sightings in Europe?

A - Yes, in fact, the sightings in Europe have been more numerous than those in this country. In October 1954, for example, the sightings in France, Italy, and Spain reached a point that almost led to mass panic. People were reporting little men by the hundreds.

Q - Are the European governments also keeping their investigations secret?

A - They definitely are; in fact, the British Government announced a year ago that it would not make any public statement on the findings of its investigation, and on the same day it issued orders to all military personnel and government personnel not to discuss the subject and not to make public any reports.

Q - Are these nations co-operating with the United States?

A - I think some of them are co-operating rather closely. I think that Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and Germany, and perhaps Italy and France, are working very closely with our own government. What the others are doing I don't know.

Q - Do you have any idea whether the Russians are starting to break the news to their people?

A - No, I haven't heard anything that would indicate that. But I'm inclined to think that the U.S. government may be starting to break it, because the Air Force has just now released the Tremonton, Utah film made by Warrant Officer Delbert Newhouse in 1952. They're also released one taken in Great Falls, Montana by Nick Mariana. Both of these men took their pictures of these objects on 15-mm color film, and they are obviously not faked. The Air Force admits that these films, which it is finally releasing for public scrutiny, show "unconventional objects of an unidentified type." These will be featured in a semi-documentary movie called "Unidentified Flying Objects" that's coming out soon.

Q - Could the saucers be using Antarctica as a base?

A - I think it's quite possible that part of our government's present interest in the Antarctic is due to the fact that in 1950 Commander Orrego of the Chilean Navy made thousands of feet of movies of UFOs circling around at low altitudes - much as in the Tremonton film - down in the Antarctic. These things are often seen travelling North and South up and down the west coast of South America. They might be going and coming from the Antarctic. You remember that Commander Byrd's last expedition down there, he found a warm lake in the middle of the Antarctic continent, and alongside this warm-water lake, in the midst of all this vast frozen area, he saw great straight black lines that "looked like blast marks." That's in his report.

Q - Has just one type of space man been discovered so far?

A - Well, I don't know for certain that any type has been discovered; but I will say this: descriptions of these creatures by credible witnesses generally fall into one of two well-defined patterns. One is a small humanoid type, as reported, for example, from Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas, and Georgia. The other is a sort of vague grotesque monster like the one reported at Sutton, West Virginia and a couple of other places. Last Fall, through the ambassador of one of the South American countries, I got to see the reports which his government had furnished him on some sightings down there of some of the small humanoid creatures. They had injured some people, principally constables, who had interfered with them. These little fellows evidently are able to take care of themselves.

Q - Did the Hopkinsville creatures display any hostility? Did they return the humans' fire - had they any weapons, or anything like that?

A - No, they did not. They carried no weapons or other artificial implements. Of course, they had long claws, but they did not seem to use those aggressively. However, on one occasion, when one of the men put his head out of the front door, one of the creatures, sitting on the overhang above the door, reached down with its clawly hand, and grazed his hair.

Q - What do you think of George Adamski and of his reliability as a witness?


- page 90 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

- 12 -

A - I have in my possession a set of prints which Mr. Adamski sent me about three years ago, and having been a photographer for 30 years it didn't take me more than 30 seconds to see that these prints were not exactly what he claimed they were. I think Mr. Adamski is probably a very kind man, but a little misguided.

Q - Do you judge Adamski entirely by his photographs?

A - No, I've read his books. I wouldn't, as a newsman, report the things that he sets forth in his books as fact without having more evidence than he's able to supply; and I regard his pictures as being on a par with his prose.

Q - What is your opinion on the experiences of Daniel Fry, Truman Bethuram, and Orfeo Angelucci? Do you believe them?

A - I wouldn't want to stand up here and say I don't believe the gentlemen. I would say that, if true, their stories are certainly remarkable. You know, sometimes we find that something we read as incredible a few years earlier was actually based on fact. But at the present time I would be inclined to class their stories of having ridden in flying saucers as slightly incredible --at least from a reporter's standpoint.

Q - Why don't the saucers land openly?

A - If we were going to another planet --and I think we're much closer to doing that now than most people realize-- and we found it was inhabited by people who had some technical knowledge, I think we would do just exactly what those saucers are reported as doing here. At first we would go a night, when they seemed to be handicapped; and if we landed, we would do it in an extremely isolated place. We would then draw them out to see how fast they could fly, and how far, and after we got a pretty good picture of their capabilities, then we might take the next step. The thing that's happening here, according to the reports, is exactly the policy that we would pursue if we went somewhere and found similar conditions.

Q - During the years that you have been studying flying saucer reports, have you noticed any changes in their reported appearance or behavior?

A - Yes, there's one thing I think has changed since 1947. As man develops more and faster vehicles in the air himself, they are apparently becoming increasingly cautious. As late as 1951 they were still sometimes seen at night with out any lights on them, but after that, to the best of my knowledge, they have all been seen with some sort of lights or at least a glow, which enables the pilots to see them and avoid a collision. Whether that's intentional or not I don't know, but it looks like it. And another thing that has changed has been the manner in which the government has treated the subject --with increasing secrecy as the years go by.

Q - Might the frequency of sightings since 1947 have something to do with atomic explosions?

A - Yes, I feel that there may be some significance in that; perhaps somebody saw these blast flashes and came in to see what was going on. We think we've seen something similar on Mars, and we'd like to know what's going on there. We'd go there and see, if we could.

Q - Will the rockets the U.S. is testing now be the answer to space travel?


- page 91 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

A - Those compare to a real spaceship the way a canoe compares to the Queen Mary. We're just paddling in the shallows of space with these things. It's a beginning, but it'll take much more.

Q - Did Dr. Slipher ever make public his last Martian investigation?

A - Yes, he did. He said that in his opinion there is no doubt but that there is life on Mars. He did not go so far as to say intelligent life-- but of course he couldn't go that far. His article appeared in the National Geographic last September, with three very good pictures of Mars, which they took at Bloemfontein with the telescope that was built down there by Morris Jessup, who wrote The Case for the UFO.

Q - Can you tell us something about the bridge on the moon, said to be made of metal?

A - Percy Wilkins' book Mysteries of Space and Time, published in England last year, is the most recent description of it that I know of; he doesn't say anything about its being metallic. And some other astronomers say that they have looked for it and didn't see it. However, one thing that has definitely been found on the moon, which is unexplained at the present time, is a number of white hemispherical objects, like halves of ping-pong balls, only they must be gigantic. The last I heard on the subject they had located about 200 of these things, which they never saw up until the last few years. I don't know why. Nobody knows what they are.

Q - These two satellites that are known to be circling the earth surely can't be natural, because they were so close. Do you think they were put there by beings from some other planet?

A - I think that's quite possible, and don't forget that Adler Planetarium reported last year that an astronomer to whom they gave their endorsement had located more than a score of objects which were circling the earth at an altitude of about 475 miles. So there must be more of them up there than we realize.

Q - Has the disappearance of six planes over the Caribbean, as described in Keyhoe's Flying Saucer Conspiracy, ever been explained?

A - No, it has not. In fact over 200 planes have disappeared in a large oval-shaped area of the Atlantic. Although all of them were equipped with radio, not one distress signal over came from any one of them, and no wreckage was ever found from any of them. I have no idea what happened to them.

Q - Has there been anything more on the Kilross Plane-disappearance case?

A - No, all I know about that is what Major Keyhoe and I were able to find out about it at the time he was writing his book.

Q - Do you have any opinion on the so-called skyquakes? The usual thing is that they're blamed on jets breaking the sound barrier, but then later it turns out that there were no jets in the air at the time. Do you think they're connected with flying saucers?

A - I don't know what the answer is to that, but it's going on all over the world. It's some kind of a terrific concussion at high altitudes. Incidentally, even if jets were in the air, they're under strict orders not to go through the


- page 92 -

- 14 -

sound barrier near any inhabited places.

Q - How long do you think it'll be before we find out definitely where the saucers come from?

A - I think that this year we may find out more about these things than we ever have before, because it is quite clear that the frequency of saucer sightings is greatest in this year when we are closest to the planet Mars. And on September 7th or the year, we're going to be closer to Mars than we have been in many years. The 90 days after that will be a very significant period.

At least 20 nations are working steadily and spending millions of dollars gathering information on these things. Eventually, if this keeps up, they'll either be able to make contact with the saucers or else duplicate them themselves. But of course it's also possible that the saucers will go away and we won't see them any more in our lifetime. There have been long periods before, for as much as forty or fifty years at a time, when there have been almost no sightings at all; perhaps they had something better to do.

You know, they might decide that we're so hopeless, and that we aren't worth all the trouble that we might cause them.

Q - But would they just go away and act as if we never existed?

A - I'll give you a comparable situation. Suppose you were flying a big plane over the jungle, and you saw a bunch of savages down there beating each other's brains out with clubs. You might circle around a few times to watch them do it, but you really wouldn't have any ambition to land and join in. And that may be the position we have reached in culture, as compared with some of these civilizations that send us flying saucers.

THIS IS THE STORY OF MY CONNECTION WITH THE "SPACE MEN" THAT DESCENDED ON T... FARM...LOCATED ABOUT SIX MILES FROM T... TOWN IN WHICH I LIVE...HOPKINSVILLE, KY. ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING THAT YOU READ FROM HERE ON IS SECOND HAND....HOWEVER IT'S THE BEST SECONDHAND INFORMATION IN THE WORLD...AS IT CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE L.PS OF THE SEVEN ADULTS INVOLVED.

TO THE BEST OF EVERYBODY'S KNOWLEDGE...IT STARTED AROUND SEVEN-THIRTY OR EIGHT-OCLOCK ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT OF AUGUST 21ST 1955.

A VISITOR TO THE ... HOUSEHOLD FROM CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA, WAS DRAWING WATER FROM A WELL IN THE REAR OF THE ONE STORY BUILDING, AS HE WAS BRINGING THE BUCKET UP, HE SAW A RED OBJECT IN THE SKY TRAILING AN EXHAUST WHICH HAD ALL THE COLORS IN THE RAINBOW.

THE OBJECT CAME FROM THE WEST...PASSED ACROSS THE RESIDENCE, AND PROCEEDED DOWN INTO THE FIELD BEHIND THE SUTTON HOUSEHOLD. IT SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN...COME TO A HALT, AND DROPPED VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND DISAPPEARING WITH A SOUND LIKE "POOF". THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE HAS A SLIGHT RISE TO IT FOR ABOUT 500 FEET, THEN FALLS AWAY TO THE BOTTOM OF A GULLY ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE HOME.

THE OBJECT DROPPED BEHIND THIS RISE WHEN IT LANDED, AND TO THIS DATE THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE OR TRACE OF ITS EXACT POSITION. IN THAT GENERAL DIRECTION...THE FIELD IS BOUNDED ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT WITH TREES...AND I MADE AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH INTO TO THE WOODS ON BOTH SIDES...PENETRATING FOR ABOUT 50 YARDS...BUT FOUND NOTHING. THE FIELD WAS SEARCHED COMPLETELY ALSO....HOWEVER ANY SOFT OF IMPRESSION IN THAT CLAY-LIKE GROUND WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE..AS THE WEATHER HAD BEEN HOT AND RAINLESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

Dear [Redacted]:

Your delayed file transparency and report of a UFO observed
August 1955 has been reviewed with interest by the Air Technical
Intelligence Center.

As an intelligence agency, we, as a rule, do not release detailed results of investigative and analytical results directly to observers submitting UFO reports, or to other principals involved.
We are, however, joining with interested when you consider, that our
dealing, with regard to objects reported as UFO's, range from aircraft and balloons to deliberate hoaxes and misrepresentations.

We naturally, consider it much more appropriate to render our findings into statistical form so be periodically released to public, not identifying individuals and local information involved, with to enter into personal controversy with individuals regarding their sightings which the Air Force does not and cannot do. However, we feel that in this case, a few words regarding the matter would be appropriate.

The transparency of the UFO, which you submitted, while to Air Center, was not just another routine examination. A large number of prints, both colored and black and white, of varying sizes and film density were made, preparatory to examination. These, and the original film underwent microscopic and other specific tests and calculations. The first approach was towards the possibility of the object being a meteor or the "jet exhaust afterburner of a dark colored aircraft," Navy "Cutlass" for example. Every effort was made to correlate the data submitted in the UFO questionnaire with the photographs.

In brief summary, the following, excluding all calculations and analytical procedures used, are the results of our analysis:

a. The trail of a meteor would generally show livid white or other light-colored hues. In contrast, the trail in the photo is darker than the sky and, momentarily in appearance.

AGAIN THEY APPARENTLY HIT IT....AS IT DID A FLIP AND DISAPPEARED. THIS TIME THE MEN DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE AND SEE IF IT WAS HIT. AS ..... STOOD BY THE DOORWAY ..... INTO THE FRONT YARD...

3-3-3-3-3-3-3

A CLAW-LIKE HAND REACHED DOWN FROM THE OVERHANG THAT SERVED TO SHIELD THE FRONT DOOR FROM RAIN. SEVERAL INSIDE THE BUILDING SAW THE REACHING HAND AND SCREAMED TO [REDACTED] DARTING OUTSIDE...

TURNED THE SHOTGUN UP TO THE CREATURES...FIRED...AD KNOCKED HIM OVER THE ROOF. APPARENTLY IT DIDN'T HARM IT HOWEVER...AS IT FLOATED DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE...LANDING ON THE GROUND WITHOUT A NOISE.

IT THEN SCURRIED OFF INTO THE UNDERBRUSH. SEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE OUT IN FRONT NOW...AND THEY DISCOVERED ANOTHER UP IN THE TREE...AND ONE A FEARED FROM AROUND THE CORNER RIGHT IN FRONT OF [REDACTED]. HE BROUGHT THE SHOTGUN TO BEAR ON THE LITTLE FELLOW...AND FIRED AT POINT BLANK RANGE...AND WHEN STOOD IN AMAZEMENT AS IT FLIPPED OVER..

GOT UP...AND RAN AWAY WITHOUT SEEMINGLY BEING HURT. WHEN A DIRECT BLAST FROM A TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN DIDN'T SEEM TO AFFECT THE CREATURES...[REDACTED] DECIDED THE OBVIOUS...HE'LL LEAVE THEM ALONE.

THEY ALL RETURNED TO THE HOUSE...AND TRIED TO PLAN WHAT NEXT TO DO. THE OBJECTS WOULD APPEAR AT A WINDOW OR DOORWAY...THE [REDACTED] FAMILY WOULD FIRE...AND THE OBJECTS WOULD [ILLEGIBLE] RUN FOR COVER.

SOMEONE THEN DISCOVERED THEY WERE ADVERSE TO LIGHT...THESE EYES YOU'LL REMEMBER WERE LARGE...AND APPARENTLY EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT. SO THEY TURNED ON THE FRONT [REDACTED] LIGHT....WHICH SEEMED TO STOP THEM FROM ADVANCING FROM THAT DIRECTION. AFTER THREE HOURS OF THIS....THE [REDACTED] FAMILY DECIDED TO GO AFTER HELP.

THERE IS NO PHONE IN THE HOME. THE FAMILY GOT INTO THE CARS...

AND SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVED AT THE HOPKINSVILLE POLICE STATION. AFTER RELATING THEIR TALE TO POLICE...A WHOLE POSSE OF HOPKINSVILLE POLICE, STATE TROOPERS, AND SHERIFF'S OFFICERS DESCENDED UPON THE SCENE. THEY FOUND NOTHING. HERE, HOWEVER, WE MIGHT CONJECTURE A BIT...THE OBJECTS DID NOT LIKE LIGHT, AND WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT


- page 100 -

THE HOUSE WAS LIT UP LIKE A ROMAN CANDLE. LOCAL AND STATE OFFICERS STAYED ON THE SCENE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS...AND NOT ONE FOOTPRINT OR TRACE OF THE OBJECTS WERE SEEN. POLICE DID AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS...AS THE FAMILY WERE TO POSITIVE THEY HAD SEEN SOMETHING, AND WERE VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED.

THE POLICE LEFT AROUND ONE O'CLOCK, AND THE FAMILY TRIED TO SETTLE DOWN FOR THE NIGHT. THE ELDEST OF THE GROUP, A MRS. WAS RESTING IN HER BED SITUATED NEAR THE SIDE WINDOW. AGAIN...ALL THE LIGHTS WERE OFF...AND SHE BECAME AWARE OF SOMETHING GLOWING IN THE WINDOW. SHE LOOKED...AND SAW THE BEING WATCHING HER. ITS HANDS WERE RAISED IN THAT FAMILIAR POSITION OF ABOUT TO BE RAISED, BUT IT MADE NO MOTION. MRS. LOOKED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW...SHOOK HER HEAD IN DISBELIEF, AND TURNED AGAIN TO THE OPENING. NOTHING HAD CHANGED...AND ONCE AGAIN SHE TURNED HER HEAD AWAY AND BLINKED HER EYES.

AGAIN THE SAME SIGHT WAS THERE TO SEE WHEN SHE LOOKED. SHE SOFTLY CALLED TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY TO COME AND LOOK. THE SHOTGUN WAS AGAIN BROUGHT TO PLAY ON THE LITTLE MAN FROM THE BACK PORCH, HAVING EXACTLY THE SAME RESULTS AS BEFORE. THE NIGHT WORE ON, AND JUST BEFORE DAYBREAK THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED. WE MIGHT CONJECTURE AGAIN HERE...THIS WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH WHAT WE HAVE ASSUMED ABOUT I THEIR SENSITIVE EYES. THE HOUSEHOLD, NEEDLESS TO SAY, DIDN'T SLEEP THE ENTIRE NIGHT, AND SHORTLY AFTER DAY BREAK...THE GROUNDS WERE CRAWLING WITH THE CURIOUS. THE FOREGOING IS THE NEAREST THING TO CHRONOLOGICAL HAPPENINGS OF THAT NIGHT, PIECED TOGETHER FROM THE INTERVIEWS I HAD WITH EACH OF THE SEVEN ADULTS INVOLVED.


- page 101 -

I ROSE LATE THAT PARTICULAR MONDAY MORNING...AS IT WAS MY DAY OFF FROM WORK. BEING AN AMATEUR RADIO OPERATOR, I DECIDED TO WORK ON MY HOBBY. WERE IT NOT FOR THIS...I WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE INTERVIEWS I DID. I RAN INTO A TOUGH PROBLEM, AND DECIDED TO SEEK THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CHIEF ENGINEER AT THE RADIO STATION WHERE I WORK. AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK I WANDERED INTO THE STATION, AND WAS GREETED BY VARIOUS COMMENTS...ALL CENTERING AROUND "HAVE YOU SEEN THE LITTLE GREEN MEN YET". INQUIRING INTO THE SITUATION, I RECEIVED A VAGUE REPORT ON THE 'NIGHTS' HAPPENINGS. REMEMBERING A RECENT ARTICLE ON POLICE ARTISTS RECONSTRUCTION OF FACIAL FEATURES...I DECIDED TO SEE IF I COULDN'T DO THE SAME. IN MY EARLIER YEARS, I HAD STUDIED ART AND PAINTING, SO I RESOLVED TO SEE IF I COULDN'T CLARIFY THE SITUATION. TAKING ONE OF THE AVAILABLE PERSONS THEIR AT THE STATION, WE SET OUT FOR THE [ILLEGIBLE] HOUSE, FULLY EQUIPPED WITH PENCILS AND LOADS OF PAPER. AS WE DROVE UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING, MRS. [ILLEGIBLE] WAS SITTING IN A CHAIR OUT ON THE LAWN. AFTER INTRODUCTIONS, SHE AGREED WITH THE OTHER TWO LADIES AT HOME TO SIT DOWN WITH ME AND SEE WHAT WE COULD DRAW. AT THIS POINT I WANT TO INDICATE THAT I DID NOT LEAD THESE PEOPLE AS WE DREW THE PICTURE...THEY WERE EXTREMELY POSITIVE OF WHAT THEY SAW...OR DIDN'T SEE...AND IT WAS MORE OF A MATTER OF ME FOLLOWING THEIR DIRECTIONS IN THE SHAPE OF THE FACE EYES, HANDS AND BODY. IF I WOULD EVEN SOME MUCH AS ADVANCE A SUPPOSITION OF HOW ONE PARTICULAR FEATURE LOOKED...THEY WOULD QUICKLY CORRECT ME. AND SO WE SAT...DRAWING SKETCH AFTER SKETCH. AT FIRST I HAD DRAWN A LARGE FACE AS THEY DIRECTED...HOWEVER AS WE PROCEEDED IT SEEMED RATHER OBVIOUS THE WHOLE BODY WOULD NOT FIT ON THE PAPER. SO WE STARTED AGAIN....


- page 102 -

IT WASN'T TOO LONG BEFORE THE APPARITION BEGAN TO TAKE FORM....
LIKE SAUCERS, LARGE, AND SET ABOUT SIX INCHES APART, THEY
SEEMED TO BE HALFWAY AROUND THE SIDE OF THE FACE, THE EARS...FLAPPY,
LIKE AN PIECE OF LEATHER....THESE SEEMED TO BE POINTED AT THE TOP..
AND THEY WERE TOO BIG. (THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS DESCRIBED). THE HEAD
ITSELF WAS CIRCULAR....COMPLETELY BALD ON TOP...AND THE FEATURES
SUCH AS THE EYES AND EARS WERE NOT PLACE ON THE HEAD AS WE MIGHT
EXPECT THEM TO BE. WE PROGRESSED TO THE BODY...NO ONE WAS SURE
WHETHER THERE WAS A NECK OR NOT...SO WE LEFT IT OUT. (LATER...
WHEN THE THREE MEN CAME BACK FROM INDIANA, THEY ALL AGREED THAT
THERE WAS NO NECK)(THIS BY THE WAY WAS NOT ASKED FOR EITHER...IT
WAS A VOLUNTARY ADMISSION BY ALL THREE IN THEIR DESCRIPTION). THE
BODY, ACCORDING TO THE WOMEN, WAS THIN...IT HAD SPINDLEY ARMS AND
LEGS....AND A FORMLESS STRAIGHT FIGURE. THE ARMS WERE PECULIAR....
THEY WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LONG AS THE LEGS, AND ALMOST TOUCHED THE
GROUND WHERE THE FEET WOULD BE. THE HANDS WERE HUGE, BULKY LACKING
FINGERS, WITH TALONS THAT CURLED...SEVERAL INCHES LONG...IN PLACE OF
FINGERNAILS. AFTER THE BASIC FORM WAS SKETCHED, AND THE HEAD ADDED
TO THE TOP OF IT, MRS. _______ INFORMED US THAT IT WAS SO LIKE THE
APPARITION SHE SAW...SHE WAS NOT GOING TO LOOK AT IT ANY LONGER....
AND PROCEEDED TO GO OUTSIDE. THE REMAINING TWO LADIES, MY SIDE-KICK
AND ______ STAYED ON INSIDE TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE
DRAWING. THE ONLY PART OF THE FACE THAT NO ONE COULD DESCRIBE WAS
THE NOSE....MAINLY BECAUSE THEY ALL AGREED THE HUGE EYES WERE
TREMENDOUSLY FASCINATING, AND DREW THEIR ATTENTION FROM THE OTHER
FEATURES. I ATTEMPTED TO SKETCH A NOSE IN, THEY SEEMED TO AGREE
IT DID HAVE HAD ONE, BUT NONE WERE SURE...SO WE REMOVED IT.


- page 103 -

Here is the text from the document:

WHEN WE INTERVIEWED THE MEN LATER, JUST ONE OF THE FOUR MENTIONED A NOSE, AND HE DIDN'T SEEM TO SURE ABOUT IT) (THE OTHER THREE DEFINITELY STATED THERE WAS NO NOSE...SO...HE WENT TO OUT)

AFTER COMPLETING THE DRAWING....HE TOOK IT OUTSIDE TO SHOW MRS. ________, WHO TOOK ONE LOOK, DECLARED WE HADN'T MISSED A THING....

AND ASKED ME TO TAKE IT AWAY...SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT ANYMORE. WE SPENT THREE HOURS AT THE ________ HOUSEHOLD THAT MORNING AND AFTERNOON, AND ASKED IF WE COULDN'T COME BACK THAT EVENING WHEN THE MEN WOULD ARRIVE FROM EVANSVILLE INDIANA. THREE OF THE MEN, ________ AND TWO OTHERS HAD GONE THEIR SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST TO GET A TRUCK REPAIRED. THE WOMEN AGREED WE COULD COME BACK THAT NIGHT, SO WE HEADED BACK FOR THE CITY. WHILE ALL WAS FRESH IN MY MIND, I SAT DOWN TO REDRAW THE SKETCH, AS THE RATHER "BEAT-UP" COMES TABLE I HAD USED AT THE ________ FARM WAS NOT THE BEST DRAWING BOARD I'D EVER WORKED ON. TRACING THE BASIC SKETCH SO AS NOT TO LOSE THE PROPORTIONS, I SMOOTHED UP THE ROUGH SPOTS, AND SHADED THE DRAWING TO GIVE MORE EMPHASIS TO THE FACIAL AND BODY FEATURES. IT WAS THIS DRAWING THAT I TOOK BACK WITH ME THAT EVENING AROUND 7:30, AFTER AGAIN PICKING UP MY SIDE-KICK ________ ...WHO HAD BEEN WORKING IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY...HAD PRECEDED MY ARRIVAL BY AN HOUR.

I VERY QUIETLY LAID DOWN THE DRAWING ON THE BED BESIDE WHERE I WAS STANDING, AND THEN MOVED AWAY. ________ CAME INTO THE ROOM, GLANCED AT THE BED...SAW THE DRAWING...RAN OVER AND PICKED IT UP...AND GAVE US ALL THE COLD CHILLS BY DECLARING "THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT, IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IT". (LATER HOWEVER, HE HAD A LOT TO ADD TO IT, HE SAW I TAKING THAT NO ONE ELSE SEEMED TO HAVE SEEN).


- page 104 -

I ASKED HIM THEN INTO THE NEXT ROOM...AND BY OURSELVES WE STARTED TO DRAW PICTURE NUMBER TWO...USING THE FIRST AS A BASIS. AGAIN, I DID NOT PROMPT HIM, BUT LET HIM LEAD ME IN THE DRAWING. THE CORRECTIONS WERE MINOR. (HE EXPERIMENTED WITH EARPHONES AND ANTENNA'S PROJECTING FROM THE HEAD, WAS VERY POSITIVE ABOUT A MUSCULAR BODY, AND EVEN THOUGH HE WASN'T AN ARTIST, ATTEMPTED TO DRAW IN SEVERAL FEATURES HE SAID HE SAW. MY OBSERVATION: I BELIEVE HE WAS ELABORATING CONSIDERABLY.) HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS SURE HE HAD SEEN A NOSE...BUT WOULD EXTRACT HIS OBSERVATION IN FRONT OF [REDACTED] AFTER THE SECOND DRAWING WAS COMPLETED...WE STEPPED OUTSIDE FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR...NO AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE LAST THREE WITNESSES TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE NIGHT BEFORE. WE HAD ONLY BEEN OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE...WHEN A THUNDERSHOWER DOUSED EVERYONE WHO COULDN'T FIND SHELTER. WE WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE & WE MIGHT REMIND YOU AT THIS POINT THAT THE [REDACTED] FAMILY HAD NOW BEEN AWAKE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY-SIX HOURS...AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW. MRS. [REDACTED] IN PARTICULAR WAS UNHAPPY, AND WENT TO THE DOOR SEVERAL TIMES TO ASK THE NEIGHBORS TO *PLEASE GO AWAY*. THE SHOWER, AS WE SAID, DID SEND ALL SCURRYING FOR THEIR CARS, BUT IT WAS SHORT-LIVED...AND THEY CAME RIGHT BACK. THIS WAS THE SCENE AND TEMPER OF THE PEOPLE WHEN [REDACTED] DECIDED AT 8:30. [REDACTED] IS A RATHER COMMANDING TYPE OF FELLOW.. HE'S WELL BUILT, STRONG, HAS DARK BLACK HAIR, AND WASN'T AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE HOMECOMING HE RECEIVED. CARS WERE LINED UP FOR A RANGE WHILE IN EITHER DIRECTION, AND HIS FRONT YARD WAS FULL OF THE CURIOUS. HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE LIKE A BEAR. WE HAD GONE INTO ONE OF THE FRONT ROOMS JUST BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL ON THE SCENE.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

MRS....A PFC FROM NEARBY PORT CAMPBELL HAD COME OUT TO DO THE SAME THING I HAD HAD
DONE EARLIER WITH THE SKETCH....ERA AN ARTIST'S CONCEPTION OF THE LITTLE MEN. BY THIS
WAY....HE SOLDIER HAD NOT SEEN MY DRAWING....AND WITH ______ HELP....HE HAD BEGUN
TO PIECE TOGETHER A DRAWING THAT WAS HIGHLY SIMILAR TO MINE. THE ONLY BAD PART OF THE
WHOLE AFFAIR WAS THAT HE WAS EATING UP, ROCK LIKE A SINKER, THE ANTENNA'S ON THE
HEAD WHICH NO ONE ELSE HAD SEEN, AND THE XXX VARIETY OF FEATURES WHICH NO ONE ELSE HAD
EVEN MENTIONED. _______ WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING HIS POPULARITY. AT THIS POINT THE
DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN....AND IN STRIDE _______ WHO SCOWLED AND SAID.."WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE". I GOT THE DEFINITE IMPRESSION THAT HIS MOTHER IN LAW....MRS _______
HAD PLANNED WITH HIM TO REMOVE ALL SIGHTSEERS FROM THE HOUSE AND SURROUNDINGS AND HE
WAS ABOUT TO START WITH US. HOWEVER, BEFORE HE DID ANYTHING ELSE, HIS EYESDROPPD ONTO
THE TABLE WHERE MY DRAWING WAS LAYING. WITHOUT SAYING ANOTHER WORD, HE SAT DOWN, AND
ONE COULD TELL FROM THE LOOK ON HIS FACE THAT WE HAD STRUCK HOME WITH THAT PICTURE.
HE LOOKED IT OVER, STARTED TO SHAKE HIS HEAD, AND SAID..."NO, THE FACE IS ALMOST
XXXXX FOUND, IT DOESN'T COME TO A POINT". WE GOT RIGHT TO WORK ON THE SECOND DRAWING
USING THE FIRST AS A GUIDE, MAKING CHANGES IN THE SECOND AS WE WENT ALONG. AT ONE POINT
HE STOOD UP TO DESCRIBE HOW HE HAD FIRED ON THE APPARITION THE NIGHT BEFORE, BRINGING THE
SHOTGUN DOWN TO BEAR ON THE LITTLE FELLOW....ONLY FEET AWAY. _______ IN MY JUDGEMENT, IS
NOT THE TYPE TO BECOME EASILY FRIGHTENED, THAT IS, UNTIL THINGS GET BEYOND THE AVERAGE
UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE, WHEN THE TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY EFFECT,
HE TURNED AND RETREATED INTO THE HOUSE. HE VOLUNTEERED THE INFORMATION AT THAT POINT,
THAT, WHEN THE SHOT STRUCK THE OBJECT, "IT SOUNDED AS THO I HAD BEEN FIRING AT A BUCKET".
THE DRAWING PROGRESSED MUCH AS THE FIRST DID....THE HEAD WAS BALD, ALL AGREED ON THAT.
THE CHIN THAT _______ SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER WAS ROUND, MAKING THE HEAD AN ALMOST PERFECT
CIRCLE. THE MOUTH AS IN THE FIRST CASE, WAS NOT MUCH MORE THAN A LINE STRAIGHT ACROSS
THE FACE, AND THE MEN COULDN'T DESCRIBE ANY OTHER OUTSTANDING FEATURES WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF THE EARS. THEY WERE FLAPPY, AND CONSIDERABLE TALLER THAN THE WHOLE DESCRIPTION HAD
INDICATED.


- page 106 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

BEYOND THIS, THEY WERE SWEPT BACK, MORE OF A HUMANS' EAR. THEY DID AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BASIC FORM OF THE EAR WAS CORRECT. BECAUSE OF THE CONSTERNATION EARLIER OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF A NOSE, I MADE A POINT OF LEADING THEM UP TO THAT QUESTION. WHEN NO ONE OFFERED ANY INFORMATION ABOUT A NOSE.....I FINALLY CAME RIGHT OUT AND ASKED ABOUT IT. NONE OF THE THREE HAD SEEN ONE.....AND WAS SURE THERE WASN'T ANY. IT WAS AT THIS TIME.....WHO WAS LISTENING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AS HE WORKED WITH THE SOLDIER ON THAT DRAWING, SAID HE HAD DEFINITELY SEEN ONE, HOWEVER.....GAVE HIM A DISDAINFUL LOOK....AND AFTER SOME HEDGING.....ENLISTED AND SAID HE WASN'T SURE. THAT GAVE THE SOLDIER A BAD OUTLOOK ON AN.....AND HE STARTED POINT BY POINT OVER HIS DRAWING AGAIN WITH HIM. WE RETURNED TO OUR OWN DRAWING. THE HAUNTING CORRELATION CONTINUED, AS THE MEN CONTINUED TO CONFIRM, DISABLE WITH, OR ADVANCE SOME NEW FEATURES. THE BODY ABOVE THE WAIST WAS POWERFUL, AND BUILT, THEN AND SPINDLEY, AS THOUGH THE LEGS AND ARMS WERE MADE OF BROOM HANDLES.

AGAIN, WE FOUND, AS WITH THE WOMEN, THE MEN HAD NOT SEEN ANY FEET. .....WHO WAS STILL BEING INTERVIEWED BY THE SOLDIER, TOLD OF FEET THAT RESEMBLED SUCTION CUPS, BUT SINCE HE WAS IN THE MINORITY....WE DECIDED NOT TO MAKE ANY INDICATION OF FEET, EXCEPT FOR A WIDENING IN THAT AREA. THE ASSUMPTION HERE MAY BE BAD OR GOOD, HOWEVER IT SEEMED REASONABLE THAT THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN BROOM-LIKE LEGS TO SUPPORT IT IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION WITH IT'S ARMS RAISED.

PERHAPS IT'S A FALSE IDEA THOUGH....BECAUSE WEIGHT WAS NO PROBLEM APPARENTLY....THEY COULD "FLOAT" DOWN F ON ROOF-TOPS. THE HANDS WERE LARGE.....WAY OUT OF SIZE....OF THAT THEY ALL AGREED. THE OUTSTANDING FEATURES ON THE ARMS AND HANDS WERE THE SAME IN BOTH THE WOMEN'S AND MEN'S DESCRIPTIONS, WITH THIS EXCEPTION. LUCKY VENTURED THE POSSIBILITY OF WEBBING BETWEEN THE TALONS, ABOVE THE FIRST KNUCKLE. THIS REMARK WAS UNSOLICTED ALSO, AND SO IT WENT.....UNTIL THE IMAGE WAS AS COMPLETE AS THE MEN COULD REMEMBER. DURING THIS TIME.....ALL THREE MEN WERE SEATED AROUND THE TABLE WITH ME.....AND HAD NOT AN OPPORTUNITY EVEN TO EAT THEIR SUPPER....LET ALONE TALK WITH ANYONE


- page 107 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

PRECEDING OUR DISCUSSIONS AND ERA ING, WE SPENT ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR TALKING WITH
THE T.A.F. MEN AND WOMEN WHO THEN CAME IN...AND THEN DECIDED WE HAD SKETCHED THE
PARTIALLY ROUGH... A QUICK CHECK WITH THE SOLDIER WHO WAS JUST COMPLETING HIS PSYC
(AND LAST I ASSUME) TESTING, AND IT REVEALED AN AMAZING SIMILARITY, EVEN TO THE
PROPORTION AS HAD WORKED OUT FROM [REDACTED]. WE WENT DOWN THE PICTURES POINT
BY POINT, AND ONLY IN A FEW OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCES DID THEY DIFFER....AND THOSE
WERE JUST ODDITIES ADVANCED BY [REDACTED] ONLY. WHETHER OR NOT..HE ATTEMPTED TO
GET THE DRAWINGS FROM THE WOMEN AND THREE MEN....I DON'T KNOW. CONSIDERING THE
TEMPER OF [REDACTED], I DOUBT IF HE DID.

I WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE AT THIS POINT THAT THESE SEVEN ADULTS HAD TOLD
ME ALMOST PARALLEL STORIES, AND GIVEN ME ALMOST PARALLEL PICTURES, YET THREE OF
THEM HAD LEFT EARLY THAT MORNING FOR EVANSVILLE INDIANA, AND HAD NOT BEEN HOME
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE TO GIVE ME TWO
SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL SEPARATE PICTURES THAT WERE WOULD TALLY SO CLOSE WITHOUT FIRST
TALKING TOGETHER AND DECIDING WHAT EACH FEATURE LOOKED LIKE. THIS WAS NOT AN INTERVIEW
WHERE ONE WOULD LOOK AT THE OTHER AND SAY..."IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK IT LOOKS LIKE"...
OH NO...ALL SEVEN WERE SURE OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN...AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF [REDACTED]
[REDACTED] AND THE NOSE EPISODE....NONE WOULD DETRACT FROM WHAT THEY HAD SEEN...EVEN UNDER
CLOSE CROSS-EXAMINATION. ( I USE THAT WORD LIGHTLY, AND YOU) ( YOU COULDN'T EXACTLY
CROSS EXAMINE [REDACTED].) THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PERIOD I TRIED TO ASSUME THE
MOST OBJECTIVE ATTITUDE. I MADE A MENTAL NOTE NOT TO BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE, BUT TO
REPORT THE INCIDENT AS IT WAS TOLD TO ME FROM THE FAMILY'S LIPS. ACTUALLY, I RATHER
BELIEVE I WAS IN A UNIQUE POSITION, BECAUSE UNTIL THE TIME I REACHED THE STATION,
I HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE INCIDENT, AND AFTER THE INITIAL JESTS....I DECIDED
TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND UNTIL I COULD TELL FOR MYSELF.

J'S PLIGHT MUSED TO NOTE HOW THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER REPORTS....INSTEAD OF A TWO-EYED OBJECT THAT WAS SILVERED IN APPEARANCE, IT SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED INTO A ONE-EYED LITTLE GREEN MAN. THIS IS JUST ONE MINOR INSTANCE OF HOW THE STORY RECEIVED WAS ALTERED.

BY ANYONE WHO TELLS THE TALE SEEMS TO ADD ITS OWN INTERPRETATION OF HOW THESE OBJECTS LOOKED. FOR THIS REASON, I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED THAT WE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF TIDE.

OUR INTERVIEW WAS THE FIRST COMPLETE REPORT OF THE WHOLE NIGHT'S HAPPENINGS, TOLD AFTER THE INITIAL ONSET OF SIGHTSEERS. THE WOMEN WERE RELAXED....AND WE HAD NO DISTURBANCE FOR TWO FULL HOURS. THAT NIGHT WE GOT THE MEN IN THE SAME CONDITION, IMMEDIATELY....BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE HAPPENINGS RECEIVED WITH THEIR WIVES AND FRIENDS. I WAS HIGHLY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR SINCERITY, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, AND ONE OTHER FACTOR WAS STILL IN EVIDENCE WHEN I ARRIVED THAT MORNING.....

THEY WERE STILL FRIGHTENED....AND WERE NOT OVER IT WHEN I LAST SAW THEM!!!!!!!!

ALL SEVEN WERE FIRMLY SURE OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN, AND COULD NOT BE SWAYED BY THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE OTHERS. EACH TO THE DID DEFINE IT A FEW MINOR INSTANCES, MORE OF THESE THE SEVEN WOULD CONDESCEND TO DEFINE THEIR ACCOUNT.

THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD I TRIED TO ASSESS ITS MOST OBJECTIVE ATTITUDE. I HAVE A GENERAL NOTE HERE TO BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE, BUT TO ACCEPT THE INCIDENT AS IT WAS TOLD TO ME AT THE TIME.

CAME TO A TILT AND DROPPED VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND AND DISAPPEARED WITH A SOUND LIKE "POOF".
