The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073, specifically for a sighting that occurred on 30 August 1956 in Omaha, Nebraska. The record card provides details about the sighting, including the date, time, location, type of observation (ground-visual), number of objects observed (one), and a brief summary of the sighting. The summary indicates that the observed object was a circular, size of a pea, yellow-white light, and it was observed for twenty-one minutes.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:
