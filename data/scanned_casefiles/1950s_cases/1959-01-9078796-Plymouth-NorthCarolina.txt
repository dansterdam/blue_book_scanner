NORTH CAROLINA COMPANY
PLYMOUTH, N.C. 1-14-1959

U.S. Air Force
Operation "Moon Watch"
Washington DC

While on "moon watch" at Plymouth N.C. 1-10-59
at 6:10 pm near that I saw a white ball coming
out of the north & east heading south by west,
when the ball was "a'bloom" & my location
it burst into flame across the sky in many
colors and hot particles began falling away.
This same time some boys from Fort Jackson
Coming to Washington N.C. west on 30-1 Highway at
the South Carolina - North Carolina line saw an
object Coming at them and burst into flame
in front of their car. In their fright they run
off the highway but recovered and did not stop
to investigate. At may have been high but looked
like Coming at them. do find a mystery that it
was hard to say it was a meteor & it think someone
was practicing missile knowing they will burn up
when entering the atmosphere.
