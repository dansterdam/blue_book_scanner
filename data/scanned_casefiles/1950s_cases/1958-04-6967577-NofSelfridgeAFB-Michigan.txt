Here is the text from the document:

Atch 10:   Subject to:  (Cont'd)

(1) Report not considered by weather officer on 12 Apr 50 afternoon.

• Unknown

• None

• Unknown

• 1/Lt Willis, Counterintelligence officer, while investigating this matter, was told by some photo recon personnel no connection with the case could be seen by the photo interpreters.

Conclusion:
This is very little info to go on to evaluate if the source thinks the photos should be expanded. There is no reason, only the suggestion to submit these to organizing interpreters. Recommend the report no.
