TELEPHONIC INVESTIGATION

UFO Incident - 9 July 1958, Massillon, Ohio
Time: 0421 Z - 11:21 P.M. (local)

Comments:

1. There are certain inconsistencies in this report on the part of the source:

   a. An object 10 feet long at arm's length would have covered his entire scope of vision.

   b. If true, the object was very close, yet he states it was *very high*.

   c. He observed object for 5 minutes, yet could not make a statement as to what details it contained. (Item b, 1(y).

2. Call made to GOC Center, Canton, Ohio, at 10:30, with view to resolving inconsistencies. NDIC - Sgt Turner (?) was given brief summary. Said G.O. would call back after matter investigated more thoroughly.

3. (Date: 24 July 58, Act No. 335-30 for long distance call)
Call received 1335 from Post C. O., Lt. John Warning, de explained that no further information could be given; that a civilian named reported the UFO; and generally concurred that it was an inconsistent and apparently unreliable report.

Captain, USAF
