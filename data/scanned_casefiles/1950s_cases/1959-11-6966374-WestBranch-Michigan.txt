Arrived and I were or with me on a hwy. driving trip. We were going north on highway 76 for miles south of West Branch when suddenly some red glowing round thing emerged from up horizon. They were in a straight line and equal distance to appear. My friend said to me "can you see that I see" he said "yes look at it". We were flying across the state of "that's what I was thinking" about it now. They were of my width but these looked close should I move because they were to get signs shaped and could see they were. They got discussion of the same kind and I wondered as they as thought it might have been a reflection of some kind or make more like turned around and then went north again over the same position of horizon. We were close to if they might be of more, towers, buildings. We flying and reported to state police in West Branch. I was near the road. They all disappeared.

AF Discoverer VII in Orbit;
Recapture of Cone Set Today

Gear Weatherproofed
To Facilitate Return

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., Nov. 7 — (UPI) — The "weatherproof" Discoverer VII satellite, carefully groomed for a significant U.S. scientific breakthrough, tested into orbit today.

The goal of the shot is to recover a 30-pound capsule from the satellite after making 17 passes over the earth's poles.

The recovery attempt, a 700-to-1 shot at best, will be made tomorrow afternoon by planes and ships in a massive "ballpark" in the Pacific ocean, southeast of Hawaii, carefully prepared to catch the capsule.

Unlike previous satellites in the program, the Discoverer has been weatherproofed with special equipment like heaters, installation and absorbing live paint. This was done to keep tiny mercury batteries warm. The batteries, which should enable researchers to pop open a 10,000 foot, apparently did not operate in two previous tries.

The Air Force said "preliminary data" obtained by tracking stations in Hawaii and Alaska showed the satellite to be in orbit with radio signals coming in "loud and clear." The orbital period for the satellite will be 15 minutes. It will be 550 miles from the earth at its farthest point, and 101 miles when it draws closest to the earth, the Air Force said.

THE AIR FORCE announced that orbit-shot achievement (time project engineers had hoped to achieve) was Aug. 19, and since that date, project engineers have worked diligently to "insure as much a chance of success as possible."

"This achievement is the next step in getting man into space," the officer added. "It's more significant but less spectacular than the Sputnik. The Launchings probe the limits of space, but it will be a long time before we're ready to send a man out there."

One precaution taken on the satellite is making as much a chance of success as possible was to keep on the cold air at altitude around the world.

U.S. Fires
Research
Rocket
5-Stage Missile
Goes 1,050 Miles
into Atmosphere

WASHINGTON, Nov. 10—(UP)—
A five-stage Army research
rocket dubbed "The Strongarm"
was successfully fired 1,050 miles
into the upper atmosphere today,
the highest ever recorded for
the launching station at Wallops
Island, Va.

The vehicle was launched by
the Army in cooperation with the
National Aeronautics and Space
administration to measure electronic densities. The Army said the
data would be "valuable in the
intercontinental ballistic missile
and antimissile missile programs."

The rocket assembly stood
taller than a five-story building,
but considerably shorter than the
missiles used for satellite launching and military shots of intercontinental range.

It was fired at 7 a.m. and
finally plunged into the Atlantic
ocean about 800 miles away from
the NASA launching pad about
20 minutes later. The rocket was
designed to reach a speed of
17,000 feet a second at burnout.
Scientists from the Army ballistic research laboratories at
Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.,
aided by a University of Michigan team, used an Army Honest
John rocket, two Nike-Ajax
boosters, a modified Recruit and
a scaled down Sergeant to ram
the nose cone into the upper
atmosphere.

IN ANNOUNCING the shoot,
the Defense department said
that it was one of a number
of experiments by various agencies in connection with the U.S. program of geophysical cooperation in 1959.

Information on the experiment
will be made available to all nations participating in the international geophysical year program.

Warren Bening, project chief
for the ballistic research laboratories, said Army experts and
NASA preliminary are interested in
how ionization decreases with altitudes—above 167 miles, and
measurements will be taken to
furnish a profile throughout the
upper flight of the rocket.

MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIF., NOV. 17--(UPI)--A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT OBSERVED BY A NUMBER OF PERSONS FLOATED OUT OF THE SKY YESTERDAY ON A LARGE PARACHUTE AND VANISHED IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. WHAT WAS IT AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM? NOBODY SEEMS EVEN ABLE TO HAZARD A GUESS.

LIFEGUARD BUD STEVENSON SAID THE OBJECT DANGLING AT THE END OF A LARGE PARACHUTE WAS ABOUT TWO TO THREE FEET LONG, APPEARED TO BE METALLIC AND WAS SQUARE AT THE TOP AND CYLINDRICAL AT THE BOTTOM.

AN AMERICAN AIRLINES TRAINING PLANE FOLLOWED THE PARACHUTE AND ITS MYSTERIOUS OBJECT DOWN FROM 51,500 FEET IN THE AIR. THERE APPEARED TO BE OTHER PLANES IN THE AREA AT THE TIME, SAID THE CREW.

A NORTH AMERICAN AVIATION HELICOPTER GO TO THE SCENE ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF OFFSHORE AND HOVERED OVER THE FLOATING PARACHUTE SO BUOY COULD BE PLACED BY LIFEGUARDS BEFORE THE WEIGHT OF THE OBJECT PULLED THE CHUTE UNDER.

THE COAST GUARD CONDUCTED A SEVERAL HOURS' LONG SEARCH. COAST GUARD SHIPS DRAGGED A MILE-SQUARE AREA IN ABOUT 46 FEET OF WATER.

EVENTS IN THE AREA MIGHT HAVE SWEPT IT OUT TO SEA OR BUNGLED-UP THE PARACHUTE AND OBJECT INTO A SMALL, COMPACT MASS WHICH WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE.

THE NAVY'S MISSILE STATION AT POINT MUGU, NORTH OF THIS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL CITY, HAS MOST DONE ALONG WITH SURROUNDING AIR FORCE, MARINE AND ARMY INSTALLATIONS, BUT ALL DECLINED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE OBJECT.

THE COAST GUARD SAID THERE WERE NO OTHER PLANS AT PRESENT TO ATTEMPT TO LOCATE THE OBJECT.

To Whom It May Concern;

A friend of mine and I were what our thought must be flying saucers or unknown north or highway 76 just south of west Branch on Sunday 29 Nov 59. There were about eight to them in successive overly spaced.

They emerged from the horizon ahead of us rising with and up thru the clouds with speed I have never seen before. They glowed red. We thought of the possibility of it being a reflection from some other later, said lights ahead of us. There was only three in each wave. We turned around and went north again over the east north of highway and our color see them go west. I have seen many missiles fired when some determined at Fort Riley, Kans. and I never saw any movement more not as fast as these things seemed to. I was what we to accelerate.

This was the same spot again speed all the way up. Of course we know time could have

Sodium Cloud Shot Lights East's Sky

Space Agency Rocket Ejects Vapors Seen Hundreds Of Miles

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18—(UP)—A man-made sodium cloud, visible several hundred miles away, was ejected into the upper atmosphere at dusk today from a rocket fired 150 miles into the air above the Wallops Island, Va., government test center.

The national aeronautics and space agency (NASA), which conducted the test, said it was designed to obtain information about the action of the winds at high altitudes. It was the first of three planned for this week as part of International Rocket Week.

Within minutes after its firing at 5:17 p.m., the man-made cloud was sighted over a wide area of the Atlantic seaboard as it caught the rays of the setting sun already below the horizon at sea level.

Cloud Is Spotted

Several points in Connecticut reported spotting the luminous vapor. Residents in Schenectady in upper New York state said it looked like a simple red cloud with a little tail on it.

Residents in Springfield, N.H., Quincy and Springfield, Mass., also reported seeing the vapor.

NASA said the experiment was designed "to obtain geophysical information on upper wind and velocity, including its velocity and direction and to test the rate of spreading vapors at high altitudes."

The cloud was ejected into the upper atmosphere by a two-stage Nike-ASP launching rocket with a timing device. Until now, it was pointed out, it has been impossible to track vapor at an altitude of 50 miles. Until now, until it reached its peak of 150 miles.

Visible For Miles

Residents of Richmond, Va., about 100 miles west of the launching site, said the cloud was not nearly as bright or large as they touched off by a similar experiment in August.

The U. S. weather bureau at Richmond said it received "dozens and dozens" of telephone calls from excited persons when the first cloud was seen but had received only one inquiry about the original shot.

Leo Backman, a newsman for radio station WRVA who stood on the roof of a Richmond hotel, said the cloud was visible for about a half hour.

The cloud appeared perhaps a little bigger than a star but did not look like a star, Backman said. "As it faded, into the smoky glow," he said, "it became barely discernible."

Flotilla
At Ready
For 'Catch'
Hope to Snag
Discoverer VIII
Capsule From Sky

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., Nov. 21—UPI)—A flotilla of naval ships and Air Force C119 "Flying Boxcars" stood ready today to snatch a Discoverer VIII satellite capsule out of the sky or sea.

Joint sea-air forces were based somewhere in the mid-Pacific near Hawaii in an area called the "ballpark" to capture the parachute-rigged capsule from the satellite soaring far away as 1,000 miles from earth.

Discoverer VIII, 78 feet long and weighing 1,700 pounds, roared successfully into orbit over a polar route yesterday. It was boosted into space by a Thor ballistic missile and thrust into an orbital velocity of 18,000 miles an hour by a second stage rocket.

WITH THE LAUNCHING went America's hopes to become the first nation to capture a man-made object from space. Neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union, as far as known, has made such a recovery.

Four earlier attempts were made by the Air Force but failed when the capsules were never sighted after their ejection. One plunged prematurely into the Arctic.

A capsule linked to Discoverer VII failed to eject because of an electrical system malfunction but scientists were more optimistic about the present attempt.

They said they have weatherproofed the satellite to withstand cold temperatures in space that caused tiny mercury batteries to freeze before activating the capsule. The capsule weighs 310 pounds and measures 27 inches in length and 33 inches in diameter.

ODDS WERE quoted at 700-1 against recovery. The feat if successful would be the "most significant achievement to date in space," the Air Force said.

It is a necessary step on the path toward orbiting a human into space.

Discoverer VIII was scheduled to unleash the capsule some 17 hours after yesterday's launching at 2:55 p.m. EST and 17 passes over the North and South Poles.

Aircraft planned to snag the object from the sky as it parachutes back to earth while ships prepared to pluck it out of the sea. The capsule is designed to float after it strikes the water.

Before the radio-controlled ejection can be accomplished, however, "the satellite" must be in position and stabilized properly in orbit.

No Case (Information Only)                   23 November 1959
                                              Papua, New Guinea

Monday, 2nd November 1959. Observed by Rev. Albert M. Kirsa, of the Mission Station, Mapau, Papua (near Kwiagora). Mission teacher and Cecil Taimo, a Native Medical Assistant.

Time: First seen about 7:30 p.m. Observed by Father Albert and others until 8:30 p.m.

The sky was cloudy to the north and west, but comparatively clear to the east (over the sea and Goodenough Bay).

The observers were on the Mission Station at Kwiagora, one of the stations of Menapi and about 15 miles S.W. from there. The station is right on the shore with a clear view to the east and northeast across Goodenough Bay to the ranges of Fergusson and Goodra.

Briefly, in approximately 20 miles across the Bay (or a bit less), they saw a brilliant, illuminated disc or "object" in the sky in the direction of Fergusson.

It was above the level of the mountains but not at a high elevation. It was approximately half the size of the full moon, but much brighter. The light was pure white, and did not change. Beneath the bright object, which was described as "like a plate", was a dark "boat-shaped" object, like a black cloud. They watched the round object slowly descend until it was "disappeared" (and "went out").

The black "cloud" being gradually obscured until it went out. The bright object did not reappear. But the black object was still visible in the same position an hour later. Fr. Albert estimated the time from his sighting of the bright object until its passing into the dark object to be about ten minutes. But Cecil saw it from 7:30 to 8:30.

There are a number of curious points about this sighting.

First: The bright object could not have been the moon, which does not rise until about midnight or later, and in any case is now only a small crescent.

Second: Although at first the "disc" was giving out a brilliant light so that the black "cloud" was quite visible, when the "disc" passed behind the "cloud" the slow disappearance of the light was not extinguished.

Third: The black object never moved during the whole sighting, nor did it change its position shape (pointed at both ends or its size). It was in the same position as hour later. Surely had it been a cloud, it would have moved or changed its shape in a fraction of this time. I have never known a cloud to remain stationary and the same shape for more than five minutes, let alone so long.

This suggests, that the object was a solid craft of some sort, probably a Mother Ship. Japan (the teacher) was sure that it was a craft, as the school children claim several times to have seen "things like boats in the sky" passing over Kwiagora at night. I remember hearing this in July, when "the object" was over their beach.

There witnesses are absolutely reliable, Fr. Albert particularly so. He is well educated, steady, administrative and completely truthful person.

(Signed) Witness: M. Kirsta
                   Tapket Mission

Recorder: Norman B. G. Cruttwell
Note: Papuan is 20 m (app.) from Kova, bagira. The sighting appeared over Papuan, but must really have been much nearer to Kwiagora.

faint streak over Miami, Florida.

U.S. NAVY MAN

Miami, Fla., 29 Nov. 1959—Joseph John
Rehill, 30, U.S. Navy Pharmaceutical
Aviation Mechanician, was focusing his
camera at an empty parking lot. Cates
Rd. a glimpse of a "sudden flash", he
snapped the shutter. When the transparency was developed, it showed five white
spots in the sky—one of them followed
by a faint streak.

Interrogated by N. F. Carey of
S.P.A.C.E. (Sat Atambre), Coral Gables,
Fla., Rehill was not cooperative. He
admitted that he had had a session with
Air Force intelligence officers. They had
examined his Argus C3 camera as well
as the complete set of transparencies
from that particular roll of film and had
found no evidence of fakery, he said.
And yet this man with 19 years of naval
aviation experience says he did not see any
thing after taking the picture to see if the
UFOs were still there.
