    1. At 1610 hours PST 30 November 1957, SOURCE was standing on the sun deck of an apartment in Cathedral City, California, when an object appeared from the south and travelled in a northerly direction where it disappeared into a mountaintop. SOURCE stated first appeared 180 degrees from true north or 270 degrees from the horizon and disappeared 45 degrees from true north. SOURCE was fairly certain the object was in view for approximately four (4) seconds.

From: Det 4, 1006th AISS                 Report No. DL/JUOB-S-57 PART ONE         Page 5 of 7

STATEMENT

As we were mounting the stairs we sighted this black object traveling from south to north. The object was black, noiseless and falling at a great speed. It was paralleling us in the Tell. It seemed to fall near the top of the mountain. There were four of us on the roof-top. Mr. (child) and Mrs. (child). We all saw the same thing and all agreed it was not a bird nor a plane.

The next morning we tried to find the object by looking through a surveyors instrument, but were unable to locate it. We also rode up to the mountains Sunday at Cabrach with the surveyor's instrument, trying to indicate the exact location. We were unable to locate it. Since the mountains are so vast, it seems a plane would be a better means of trying to find it.

PART FOUR: COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The preparing officer was unable to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the cause of the sighting because sighting could be concluded as only one observation. An object was observed from one point and had discussed the sighting in considerable detail which lowered the reliability of their individual statement. In SUCH's (?) individual statement, they stated they were listening to a radio broadcast that the rocket of Sputnik was to pass over at that time and they immediately went outside to see a few conclusions are offered for consideration as possible causes of the sighting:

a. Other: A bird in the proper flight attitude in the immediate vicinity could account for the sighting. Note: Size and distance estimate of SCURC's were only fair.

b. Aircraft: The Palm Springs airport was in the near vicinity of the sighting. Aircraft in a strange attitude to observers could have caused the sighting. Although the airport was controlled for flight schedules for that day with negative results, a local could have been made without a record at that airport according to official details.
