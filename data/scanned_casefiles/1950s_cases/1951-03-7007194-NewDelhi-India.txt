Cigar shaped object viewed by about 25 witnesses from air field, made loop, and flew off to South. Initial appearance of which cloud about 700 ft long and believed to be at 3-4,000 ft. Cloud increased in length and bulged shape. Tail about 100 ft long. No sound. Object flew over airport. Speed erratic slow speeds, no smoke. Rapid speed smoke black, and control appeared similar to be either manual or wireless. Top speed estimated to be about 2,000 mph. Cigar shaped. Prone to exaggerate.

11. COMMENTS
Flight and maneuvers consistent with analysis as a/c, however the many witnesses should have been able to identify some feature of an a/c since all were familiar the local airplanes. Case listed as UNIDENTIFIED.

                AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

A/A India                                                    1-24-51            PAGE 1 OF 1

1. On Thursday morning 15 March 1951 an object was sighted by [redacted] the chief aerial engineer of the [redacted] along with his assistants, and [redacted] who some twenty other mechanics and helpers professed to have witnessed this object. Mr. P. Nilakantam, interviewed by the reporting officer of the stories were all the same. Director General of Civil aviation agency in India, accompanied the reporting officer with investigative steps.

2. The object sighted was shaped like a cigar with no outer visible control surface. It was about one hundred feet long and six a half to seven feet high, bare metal color and only one object sighted. The exhaust was described as white, except when its speed was increased, then the exhaust turned black. We estimated the speed to be about three times greater than cruising speed of a British Vampire. The object came over Safdarjang airdrome, New Delhi (295541) (770:12) from the north at about four to five thousand feet high, made one large over the Indian to the south, then came back over the field in a very large loop. At the top of the loop it was out of sight but we could see it descending in a steep angle. Upon recovering straight and level flight it proceeded out of sight traveling in a south-westerly direction at very high speed. The exhaust smoke was of a white color and very bright. The object was sighted at 1000 local time and was observed for approximately seven minutes. The observers were on a taxi strip working with 100 yards of the control tower. The weather at the time of sighting was clear, sun shining with thirty mile visibility.

3. Mr. [redacted] years old, has held an Indian pilot and Indian engine license since 1935. His experience covers twenty years in aero engineering (no formal engineering education). He has worked at Gates Flying Club, Hindustan Airways, as engineer in charge, aircraft inspector for Director General Civil Aviation, Ministery of Transport, Ltd., Bangalore, India, and chief engineer Club. [rest of paragraph partially illegible]

4. The enclosed statement, signed by [redacted] was prepared with the assistance of a newspaper reporter for the specific purpose of a newspaper article. However, it is quite descriptive of the type of individual [illegible].

1. On Thursday morning 15 March 1951 an object was sighted by Mr. [redacted], the chief aerial engineer of the [redacted] and his assistants, Mr. [redacted] and some twenty other mechanics and helpers. Professed to have witnessed this object. Mr. P. Nilakantam, educated at California Institute of Technology and now Director of the Research and Development Laboratory of the Director General of Civil Aviation Agency in India, accompanied the reporting officer with interview these people. Mr. Nilakantam recognized it as one of the best aerial engineers in India.

2. The object sighted was shaped like a cigar with no outer visible control surfaces. It was about one hundred feet long and a big a-round 5 or 6-7/10 feet in bare metal color and only one object sighted. The exhaust was described as white, came out about three times longer than the exhaust turned black. Estimated the speed to be about three times greater than cruising speed of a British Vampire. The object came over Safdarjang Airdromes, New Delhi (280251N) (770121 from the north at about four to five thousand feet high), made one pass over the field to the south, then came back over the field in a very large loop. At the top of the loop it was out of sight and came into sight again in its five. Upon recovering straight and level flight it proceeded out of sight traveling in a south-westerly direction at very high speed. The exhaust smoke was of a white color. The object was sighted at 1000 local time and was observed for approximately seven minutes.

3. Mr. [redacted], 40 years old, has held an Indian pilot and Indian engineer license since 1935. His experience covers twenty years in aero engineering (normal engineering education). He has worked at Lakes Flying Club, Himalayan Airways, as an engineer in charge, was flying Central Airlines, Flying Club, engineer in charge, aircraft inspector for Director General Civil Aviation, Ministry of Transport, New Delhi, Bangalore, India, and other assignments. However, it is felt that some object did come over Delhi and that it was unconventional. The stories of all twenty-five witnesses are consistent.

4. The enclosed statement, signed by [redacted] was prepared with the assistance of a newspaper reporter for the specific purpose of a newspaper article. However, it is quite descriptive of the type of individual Mr. [redacted] is.

Oyll it was you like-- having a sore, a suicide now. The
pink incident. & what you may - that I and have now on the
rk nd what I saw were the effects of the morning oft - the night
before, but, however you may think or so is mile out of the ordinary.
what I and many others saw is certainly something out of the ordinary.

Before I say more I would like to mention that I have been
associated with aeronautics for over twenty years. I am an operational
engineer nd a pilot with about experience of over 10 years. I am
trained that should turn to my usual means, in brief, what I saw in
sky, before you come & knife to matter will be to me.

On Thursday morning the 13th Jan, 1951, I was standing by
Standard Time I was turning by my watch which was being serviced by
the an executive. I was looking towards the sky, suddenly I noticed
a an angle-sea. all of sudden, a starting a loop to plunge,
swirly cloud suddenly open way in the sky was such to much to out
seven hundred feet in depth in proximity to house to five house on
feet high with near the Delhi flying blue anger. I immediately called
out to _______, showed him the other cloud was mid height in the
wall in there. Before he could say anything the cloud have made it
and then at the end of it I saw a white mass or jet height.

At approximately 100 ft. I saw on the 6th that there were
those (mechanics, etc. were. at _______ at the time. The
just 15 to 20 yards way. The object was ______. I must say and I
all agree the way it was, it had been in the same static line for
ye rs all over. The object as far as I could see was it was not a
cloud. The travelling in this direction for 3 minutes to me look
or (the looked like a _______ plane) at the top of the loop
would see sky which seemed to be near east of nature. & the point to note
that was kind of pointing at dolour followed by _______ with a
five _______ such talk.

From at the last, it seemed _______ at leaving a building with
signal _______ by the one left or the service. The object was

Visible to me over 7½ minutes.

To be - little more descriptive I must say that this peculiar object travels t v rying speeds and alters its course in such manner that it appears to be under a manual or wireless control. While travelling at slow speeds it does not make trail but when it accelerates it leaves black smoke trail which turns into a whitish swirly cloud denotes as if left by a turbine.

I refer to the when travelling at top speed this so called Flying Saucer is travelling at a speed of 2,000 miles per hour.

I do not understand why it is called Flying Saucer as it is not shaped like a saucer but more like. Clearer. Perhaps when this object is viewed from the underside it may look have the shape of a saucer.
