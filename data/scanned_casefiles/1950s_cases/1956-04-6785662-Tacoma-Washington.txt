- Multiple reported mysterious lights have been seen in the sky
- may the best. The lights were seen more than a star. Brighter than
a star. They remained silent stationary over the district for
several minutes, and then gradually shot away at high speed. (Conf.

On April 14, 1956 over Manomet, Massachusetts a dome-topped object with rotating lights and landing wheels was taken by Miss Dorothy Currier of the Air Force.

She reported that the object was seen by a group of persons and that a "humming" sound was heard coming from the strange "flying saucer-shaped object."

Mr. 22 - Coffeyville, Ma. Richard Henry and the F. J. Bangle family spotted a flying disc, giving off a bright red glow around 10:30 p.m. They watched the strange object move slowly in the sky between their home and Coffeyville. No other distant objects were sighted, by Mr. Henry. "the disc disappeared about 11 feet long." (This later subjective figure is difficult to interpret.) After watching the account continued, the red glow seemed to fade a little and the items proceeded seeing tiny lights appear on the object's surface.

Apr. 25 - El Monte, Calif. - C. M. Crews, of Covina, described a "silent white" which emitted no sound and was a brilliant white. The UFO, first observed at 8:30 p.m., appeared to be hovering about 1,000 feet above his position. "It had no riding lights." Crews, who had first dimmed his car lights, stated that, "First thought it was a plane," added the object finally "made an arc" and headed southeast. (El Monte Herald, 4/27)

Apr. 29--Phoenix, Ariz.--Bill Moore, with his family, were driving from Los Angeles to Greenwich, Conn. Here is his story:

"As we were starting out in the morning on the highway to Tempe, Arizona (between Phoenix and Tucson), my father remarked about an object in the sky to the right front of us. When I first looked I saw a dark object with a sort of metallic appearance. My father also looked and asked what it was. I told him I didn't know. As I looked I didn't have time in focus right away but I could tell that the object was a long cigar shaped with a dark spot, or hole, in the center. I then handed the glasses to my father. After a while he said he saw what looked like a row of windows or ports along the side. He kept watching and remarked that while he was watching, something like a little meteor case shooting out of the bottom. About this time I noticed that the thing seemed to flare up, after which it appeared to be far away.

"Along the side of the highway were telephone poles, two in a row. This is important because the object seemed to follow the poles with each end doubling--at least, for a sort time. Finally, after we were out of the traffic, we stopped along the road. My father got out of the car and looked at the object, which now seemed from the right to the left of the highway, and away from the telephone poles. It was now over some mountains in the distance and seemed to have gotten there rather quickly. I got one last good look at it through the binoculars before we and it moved away. It looked like a big ball point pen that was glowing on top and dark underneath. The sighting, in all, lasted ten minutes." (Bn. Rpt.)

East Mansfield, Massachusetts

App. 20 - East Mansfield, Mass. - Mrs. Olsen, 1175 East Street, described what appeared to be a "ball of fire" in the sky at 815 p.m. She said, "It appeared coming down" just a few feet from her house. "A ball of fire, the size of a baseball", then "shot upward as it hit the road, in a burst of orange flame." The newspaper account added, "Small fragments burned on the ground. They were brought into the Gibsons house." But as they had no explanation without a trace, there was nothing left... only a strange burnt smell in gravel on the roadside where the fire burned." (Mansfield Law-Tel-5/3.)

                                                           Coffeyville, Kansas

Apr. 2 - Coffeyville, Kan. - R. H. Smith was awakened when his wife became alarmed over the increasing velocity of the wind shortly after 1 p.m. Said he: "I went outside to check the clouds and to my astonishment saw this illuminated object gliding down toward a neighbor's home. There was no tremors visible. But the lighted body appeared somewhat shorter than the standard airplane with a wingspread of about 30 feet. It hovered over the Lee Forkner house, about 300 feet south of our home, at what I judged 300 feet altitude, then glided across the road to a circle the Forkner house before starting toward our home." Mr. Smith continued, "Before the object settled our place, however, it moved off and started to sound like a plane. I could hear the motor that was keeping up as the object was the object. For a few minutes, it seemed to just glide and then disappeared into the clouds." (Coffeyville Daily Journal, 4/3.)

....On the night of April 4th, about 15 or 20 people in Durham, N. C., reported seeing "a silver-colored angel" flying north over the local U. S. Steel plant.  One man said that he could see it flapping its wings..

BRILLIANT OBJECT STARTLES MONTANA RESIDENTS: Five people living in the Brown's Gulch district of Montana reported that on the night of April 6th, at about 9:30 p.m., they saw an extremely bright object which seemed to be in the sky near their house. Mrs. Victoria Gabrielli, her son Victor Gabrielli, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Mitchell and Mrs. Mary Baxanella were gathered in the Gabrielli residence watching television, with the house partially darkened, they said, when the phenomenon occurred. "It lit up the whole house," Mrs. Gabrielli said. "The television blacked out at the same time. We thought it was a crashing plane or some kind of explosion, but there was no noise. The television came on again in a few seconds." The Civil Aeronautics Administration offices at the local airport said no unusual objects in the sky had been logged or reported at its office that night, and that there were no plane crashes in the area.
