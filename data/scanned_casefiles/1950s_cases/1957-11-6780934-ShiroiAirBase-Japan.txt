World 'Flying Saucers' Day
By GRO HANI

Although no preparation of any sort of celebration has been reported, tomorrow is the 11th anniversary of the sighting of nine shining "saucers" which are to be more exact, when the word "flying saucers" was first used.

On June 24, 1947, Idaho businessman Kenneth Arnold reported observing nine shining "saucer-like" objects flying in the Cascade mountain range of Western Washington while piloting his private plane.

The report touched off a nationwide sensation in the United States, followed by other parts of the world. The police, news papers, Air Force bases were flooded with reports of mysterious flying objects. Astronomers and scientists and military leaders issued contradictory explanations, thus making the puzzling phenomena.

In the succeeding years, the excitement gradually died down and the topic seldom makes headlines. But there are still hopeful leaders and small news items from time to time on enigmatic flying objects sighted at one point or another and groups who call "ufology" are spotting "UFO" or unidentified flying objects almost every day in some part of the world.

There are ufologists in Japan, too. And unidentified flying objects are locally sighted quite often too.

There are amateur astronomers, for instance, reported having sighted large shiny objects in the sky over Kanayamachi, Wakayama Prefecture, on Nov. 27 last year.

The "Master Unit Commander" and flying saucer enthusiasts of the Cosmic Brotherhood Association, calmed the flying saucer craze among the public somewhat but drew vehement retorts from ufologists.

Kinichi Arai who heads the Japan "Flying Saucer" Association says Dr. Miyaji's argument is counterfeit. Dr. Miyaji gave a lecture on balloons, meteors, searchlights and others unmentioned by the Cosmic Brotherhood for UFO saucers.

But as official investigation by the U.S. Air Force revealed several years ago, he says, about 3 per cent of all reported UFO sightings by official sources have remained unexplained. While 97 per cent were dismissed as misidentification of other objects or just hoaxes and hallucinations.

He says ufologists are dealing with "so-called scientific" observations.

Cosmic Brotherhood Association, eldest and youngest organization in Japan, is made up of such members who claim they contacted a group of "spacemen" on the night of June 7 with a gadget called "Master Unit Communicator." The machine converts, according to them, sound waves to light waves and vice versa.

The "spacemen" are capable of receiving and transmitting light, says Yusuke Matsumura, the leader of the group, said some 30 members of the association gathered around the gadget set up 30 miles west of heart of Tokyo, and kept shouting: "Hello, spacemen, are you there?"

Then in early hours of the next day, they heard the spacemen mainly answer, and reward was a message written in the rain.

"Hello, our Japanese' friends. This is the voice from the space," the message said, despite the rain, and the voice faded out in hum and "monotonous" vibration.

Matsumura has promised to give another observation scheduled for early July.

trained observers.
According to a report published by the Amateur Astronomers Association, the three men saw it around 10:27 a.m. during daylight. The silvery white object, about two-thirds of a full moon in size and firm geometrical shape, was the most interesting part of the report, as the three of them thought the object was "revolving."

More recently, a oval-shaped object was observed over Ueno City. On April 8, this year, seven luminous objects in the formation of a half-moon were seen over Kobe, and on May 29, eight orange-colored flying objects were seen.

This line did not fly that which the Modern Space Travel Associations, one of three ufological bodies in Japan.

Such reports of mysterious luminous objects have steadily since the Russians shot up its first Sputnik an Oct. last year. That is, more people are interested by the influx of inquiries and information on these objects.

Dr. Masatoshi Miyaji, leader of the Optical Observatory and leader of the Japanese IGY survey project issued a statement on Dec. 7 last year in thevernacular press denying the existence of flying saucers.

He said observers are citing nonsensical and unscientific observations. He said observe-

[Continued in next column, interrupted]

[Right Column]
[Continuation of left column text]
-rs and they know that objects are not included in this unexplained category.

In the case of Dr. Clyde W. Tombaugh, famous Amateur Astronomer who discovered Pluto, there is no more credible testimony than an eyewitness account by experienced astronomers. Arch Brolund, in a brief report, said "Luminous aerial phenomenon."

"I saw the object about 11 o'clock one night in August 1949 in the vicinity of Las Cruces, New Mexico." He said, admiring the beautiful transparent sky of stars, when suddenly, I apparently saw a group of solid blush-green rectangular lights."

"Lubbock lights" moved southwestward and the formation (three rectangles across) and the intensity of the lights and their color are about 35 degrees above the horizon. Total time of visibility was about three seconds. I was too flabbergasted to count the number of rectangles of light, or to note some other features I won't describe later. There was no sound.

"I have done thousands of hours of night sky watching, but never saw a sight so strange as this." The rectangular of lights appeared there been a full moon in the sky. I am sure they would not have been mistaken.

Among ufologists, there are those who take a more positive stand and believe in the existence of flying saucers.

Classified the object might still the
thought time could be no just perhaps the object
direction (South west) and I know if it would
be moving. it looked at it for about three
minutes continuously but it seemed to be
not moving. later it walked towards left
side little so that the star might hide in the
flag pole. Then I observed the object if
it would come out from that flag pole.
But it did not come out of the pole at all
then it went back to the object to continue
any work. About one hour later, I
again walked out to see the object which
moved way back with less brightness
and in the same direction as I saw
first time.

7. The following sightings were reported in a Japanese language newspaper:

a. Mr. Masauro YAMADA, a student residing at 6012 Morigasaki, Ota-ku, Tokyo, noticed at approximately 1755 hours 10 Nov 57 from the street in Trans of Nib house a light green and reddish fireball flying over Haneda Airport for about three seconds. It finally exploded emitting a shower of sparks but the sound of the explosion was not heard.

b. An employee of Yamamoto Camera Works at 6-1 Kyobashi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, observed at about 1755 hours 10 Nov 57 an object similar to an illuminated shell (Ed: Pyrotechnics flare) flying in a southwesterly direction from the northeast. It exhibited a pale tail light. The size was about that of a ten yen coin. (Japanese currency) (Ed: 15/16 of an inch).

c. On the same day Miss Fumiko TAKAHARA of 617 Natsudai, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, noted at approximately 1755 hours from the Matsudai-shinta bus stop (near Washington Heights) an object about the size of an egg flying in a southwesterly direction leaving a red tail until it fell in pieces like star scraps, splitting silently.

d. Police Officer Isaturo YAMAZAKI of the Kamata Police Station noticed, while stationed at the Imaribashi checkpoint at the entrance to Haneda Airport, a bright object at about 1800 hours (Ed: No date mentioned) similar to a greenish mercury vapor lamp flying near the planet Venus and beginning to twinkle. When it became bright green like a fireball it silently exploded and disappeared.

e. Mr. Masao NAKANE, a company employee living near the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory at Mitaka, observed a flying object at Mitaka-bus stop at around 1755 hours (Ed: No date mentioned) flying in a generally due west direction. It flew from north to south for about two seconds at an altitude of about 30 degrees from the horizon below Venus. Its size was that of a closed fist. The object emitted an intense blue-white light like an electric arc spark. Then exploded, exhibiting a very bright light then split into three sections and disappeared.

8. Relative to the above sightings, the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory states: "Telephone calls telling of flying objects being observed in various places were received. Since the times of observation almost coincides we are investigating. At present, it is conceivable that this object might have been a meteor. In the future, if they will let us know more definitely the time and place it will aid investigation."

g. Mr. Tatsuo TAKEDA, a farmer at Kanaya-machi, Arita-gun, Wakayama-ken, observed a fireball flying in the eastern sky at about 1745 hours, and was the fourth of star of fireball sightings. A middle-school student in the same town also noticed the fireball.

h. In Nagoya, members of the Nagoya District Astronomical Observatory saw a fireball which flew from west to east leaving a tail about 2 meters long.

some material like glass fiber falling from the sky. When a special USAF
investigator and a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel touched it in order to
take photographs it disappeared instantly. Because of its appearance it
has been called "angels hair". Later it was also reported in France and
New Zealand. At 1000 hours 4 Oct 57 this material was reported for the
first time in Japan. It fell continuously for two hours on the grounds of
the Sakuramachi Middle School at Ichines. The longer strands ranged from
5 to 6 meters in length and the shorter about 30 centimeters. Instructor
Yuichi KUMAGAI of the school sent photo to the Japan Flying Saucer
Research Society for examination. Mr. Kindai ARAI, at 268-1 Gotanda,
Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo. The society conducted reflection and perspective
photographic studies and a microscope of 150x magnification. This
"angels hair", which is similar in appearance to decorative thread for
Christmas trees, is an organic substance that dissolves in hydrochloric acid
and burns easily. The cinders form spherical shapes like those formed when
hair is burned.

J. The most recent case in Japan is that of Mr. Tatsuya MATSUDA
of 48-1 Minami-Sen-ju, Arakawa-ku, Tokyo, who noticed a brilliant white
missile at 1451 hours 18 Oct 57. The object flew slowly emitting a light
such as that realized from highly polished metal. It was rocket-shaped
with neither wings or tail. It proceeded from the zenith to the northwest
and soon disappeared. Observation time was from twenty to twenty-five
seconds. Since the object was observed in daylight and Mr. MATSUDA is a
member of the Japan Astronomical Society and the Toa Astronomical Society,
the observation was not considered to be an illusion.

k. At around 1820 hours 1 Nov 57 a high-school student, Hiromi
YOSHINARI of Ono-machi, Tamura-gun, Fukushima-ken, noted a small, round
beam which acted like a flying saucer for about 15 minutes. (Bai Apparent
discrepancy in "most recent sightings" unexplained.) The object was
slightly more reddish than the moon. It made several rotations in the
direction of the northwest at 2,000 meters altitude, then descended,
ascended once more and disappeared to the north. Besides YOSHINARI, there
are five eye witnesses to the sighting. Doctor Seiichi MIYAJI, Chief of
the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, is quoted as saying: "The fact that
observers noticed this flying body is an undeniable fact. But, it should
not be immediately considered a flying saucer. It is necessary to further
study this celestial body. Careful observation is needed since aircraft
and balloons are often mistaken for other objects."

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

8. All information pertaining to meteors is forwarded to the
Meteor Section of the Oriental Astronomical Society (KA TEMON GAKKAI)
at Kameya, Azabu-Gun, Wakayama-ken. This society publishes a monthly
magazine on meteors, stars, etc., and the data includes sightings by
amateur and professional astronomers in Japan. The published data is
usually two months old. The UFOB Research Group (UFOB KENKYU GURUPU HONBU),
Box 3, Inage Post Office, Yokohama, specializes in flying saucers and
unidentified objects. A report on this group is published monthly in the
World's Aircraft magazine.
