SUMMARY (Enter single paragraph summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List inclosures in lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112-Part II)

1. A B-47 crew, while flying in bomber formation in vicinity of 71-OCN - 156-20W at 30,000ft, between the hours of 1620Z and 17052, 12 December 1954, reports sighting of UFOB approximately three miles ahead of the aircraft, waning in color from blinking red to steady white, and totally dissolving with approach of daylight after forty-five minutes of intermittent observation.

2. The object reported is without configuration or performance, and though it could easily be mistaken as a fighter-type aircraft at first sight, is is believed, after preliminary analysis, to be a celestial body or the reflection of such a body.

AF FORM 112—PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

19th Da Sq, 22d Bn Wg, March AFB                    UNCLASSIFIED

1. a.    Oval
    b.    Baseball
    c.    Blinking (pinkish-red for fifteen (15) minutes, turning steady white for
           fifteen (15) minutes, then disappating with daylight.
    d.    One
    e.    N/A
    f.    No material substance discernible. Just a light
    g.    N/A
    h.    N/A

2. a.    Object was initially mistaken for an interceptor aircraft making a pass at
           the bomber formation
    b.    Level at 11 O'clock
    c.    At 12 O'clock
    d.    Object first appeared to be fighter making a pass. The observing B-47 made
           a 10 degree bank to left, and object moved to position of 11:30 O'clock
           it appeared to be forward of lead aircraft.
    e.    Observed member went into clouds for refueling. Upon coming out of clouds
           fifteen minutes later, observing pilot noticed a steady white light, reared
           as a planet, in the same relative position of the other object. Object
           gradually dissolved into the coming of daylight.
    f.    Forty-five (45) minutes intermittently
    g.    Visual
    h.    N/A
    i.    N/A, Tail # 7033, 30,000 ft. altitude, 160 degrees true heading, 425 knots
           true air speed, March AFB, Home Station
3. a.    16200, 13 December 1954
    b.    Night to Dawn
    c.    71-00N - 156-20W

    c.    Robert E. Nys, Captain, Pilot
5. a.    High Altitude haze
    b.    Not available
    c.    None
    d.    Unlimited
    e.    Undercast and high altitude haze
    f.    None
6.    Initially assumed to be a fighter-type aircraft, but after constant observation
       by co-pilot was determined to be a planet.
7.    None
8.    Observing aircraft was in formation with other B-47's. All B-47's were
       within sight of observing aircraft.
9.    The Intelligence Officer of base, preparing this report, believes that, after
       constant observation by the observing members over a period of time, the
       transition of colors from blinking red to steady white, the objects relative
       position with the bomber formation after the color change, and its final
       dissolution with the appearance of daylight, the object sighted was obviously
       a celestial body. It is furthermore believed that the way the sighted
       object moved in its shape, etc., it could initially be mistaken as a
       fighter-type aircraft by an untrained observer.
