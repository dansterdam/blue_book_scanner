SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in a final one-sentence paragraph. List enclosures at lower left. Details of report on AF Form 112—Part II)

1. A B-47 crew, while flying in bomber formation in vicinity of 71-CON – 156-20N
at 30,000ft, between the hours of 1620Z and 1705Z, 12 December 1954, reports
sighting of UFOB approximately three miles ahead of the aircraft, waning in
color from blinking red to steady white, and totally dissolving with approach
of daylight after forty-five minutes of intermittent observation.

2. The object reported is without configuration or performance, and though it could
easily be mistaken as a fighter-type aircraft at first sight, is is believed,
after preliminary analysis, to be a celestial body or the reflection of such
a body.

                                                       R-35501

          the bomber formation
         b. Level at 11 O'clock
         c. Light at 12 O'clock
         d. Object first appeared to be fighter making a pass. The observing B-47 made
             a 10 degree bank to left, and object moved to position of 11:30 O'clock level.
             It appeared to be forward of lead aircraft.
          e. Observing bomber went into clouds for refueling. Upon coming out of clouds 
             fifteen minutes later, observing pilot noticed a steady white light, reported
             as a planet, in the same relative position of the other objects. Object 
             gradually dissolved with the coming of daylight.

         d. Unlimited
         e. Undercast and high altitude haze
5.    None
6.    Initially assumed to be a fighter-type aircraft, but after constant observation 
         by co-pilot it was determined to be a planet.
7.    None
8.    Observing aircraft was in formation with other B-47's. All B-47's were 
         within sight of observing aircraft.
9.    The Unit Intelligence Officer, preparing this report, believes that, after 
         constant observation by the observing members over a period of time, the
         transition of colors from blinking red to steady white, the objects relative
         position with the bomber formation after the color change, and its final
         dissolution with the approach of daylight, the object sighted was obviously
         a celestial body. It is furthermore believed that the way this sighted
         object moved in its shape, etc., it could initially be mistaken as a 
         fighter-type aircraft by an untrained observer.
