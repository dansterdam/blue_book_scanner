1. In accordance with established ATIC and Air Force policies for the study and evaluation of unidentified aerial objects, request that attached specimens be examined and a report as to their composition and identity be made to this office.

2. The metallic specimens appear to be a form of iron-nickel-cobalt alloy, which may be of meteoric origin. The specimen within the glass container purports to be "angel's-hair", and it cannot be determined whether organic or inorganic composition.

3. Special Investigator, W/Sgt 02 Dc Hill, obtained the specimens Saturday afternoon, 13 October 1956.

4. A brief background surrounding these specimens should be of some assistance in initiating a study of these items, and to indicate reasons why this seemingly unusual request is considered.

5. Subject specimens were submitted by an individual who is the head of one of the largest private UFO research organizations. Official case files have revealed that this self-appointed UFO investigator, and analysis 1952, has repeatedly attempted to embarrass the Air Force by unfounded statements to the press. He has publicly accused a high-ranking ATIC officer of admitting the existence of flying saucers.

6. He has a large following of "flying saucer" adherents. Is editor of two UFO publications, appears to be a close friend of both radio and TV commentator and Press commentator. He is well known as a UFO writer who has had a long-standing argument with the Air Force regarding the UFO question.

7. The metal fragments were allegedly found by this individual in a stone quarry in the outskirts of Cincinnati (Middleville-Medina area). The specimens are claimed to be only small fragments of a larger mass stated to be about 16 inches in diameter and about 10 inches thick. The investigation was told that it had hit the quarry with some force and found embedded.

8. The individual submitting these metallic fragments claimed that he submitted them to the University of Cincinnati for examination, and it was found that they were not of meteoric origin.

DF COMMENT #1 to AFOIN-142c                                                FROM: AFOIN-424                 UNCLASSIFIED                 16 October 1956

SUBJECT:   (U) Analysis of Material Allegedly from "Flying Saucers".

f.  Angel's-hair.  This odd term requires some explanation to those un-
initiated in certain words coined by so-called UFO experts, writers and pseudo-
scientists, who are now giving this term some publicity.  "Angel's-hair" purports
to be the solidified cobwast or propulsive by-product of "flying saucers", which
vanishes after a few hours exposure to the earth's atmosphere.  This is the
"Planters Theory", so-called, after the French officer who published this in the
military journal, "Forces Aeriennes Francaises" (September 1953).  According to this
theory, the propulsive units of these interplanetary craft represent a design un-
known to earth and function by utilizing cosmic radiation from space, successfully
transforming it into nuclear, thermal, these kinetic energy.

g. In August of this year, the Kraft TV Hour, among others, gave this
so-called "angel'-hair" nationwide attention in a sci ence fiction drama whereby
this gossamer-like substance is shown vanishing without leaving any residue before
the eyes of AFOIN chiefs.

h. The investigator in this case reports that upon surveying the area
in question he found a small amount of this substance in the street near the indi-
vidual's residence.  Upon handling it, it dissolved in his hands.

i. A special briefing was prepared for General Lewis and his staff a
few days ago which included the problem of these private UFO organizations, and
the case file of the individual who supplied these specimens was submitted as a classic example.

5. Therefore, in view of the possible adverse publicity that may result from
this case, it is requested that within your Division or in coordination with other
outside laboratories, every effort be made to both preserve and identify the specimens submitted herewith.

Subj: (U) Analysis of Material Allegedly from "Flying Saucers" dtd 25 Oct 56

TO: AFOIN-46L                FROM: AFOIN-4E2                DATE: 25 Oct 56    COMMENT NO. 2
                                                            AFOIN-4E2c/Mr. Naugle/mj

1. In compliance with your request, laboratory examinations of four metal samples and a textile thread purported to be "angel hair" have been made at White Stork.

2. The following results are submitted to your office:

    a. Metal Samples

    All four samples were found to be ferro-chromium and magnetic and not radioactive. The composition obtained spectrographically for those samples was:

    Chromium                 67 - 71 percent
    Silicon                  0.1 - 1.0 percent
    Ni, Co, & Mn             0.2 percent
    Mg, Ca, & Al             0.5 percent
    Iron                     Balance

    The crystalline structure and non-oxidized condition of these samples points directly to the fact that a high-temperature such as would be encountered by case of meteoric origin has not been imposed. Both the common appearance and the analysis of these samples strongly suggest that they have come from the bin of either a steel mill or steel foundry where chromium is customarily added to steel melts in this form.

    b. Textile Sample

    The sample purported to be "angel hair", reportedly a volatile by-product of the fuel used in "flying saucers", was given both chemical and microscopic tests, and is, in all probability cuprammonium rayon, which is more commonly called "Bemberg Rayon" in the U.S. This material, after exposure to air for 72 hours in the Air Weapon Materials Branch did not volatilize.

3. A formal report was not requested from White Stork. Rough draft memoranda from White Stork are attached hereto, and the samples which are man made are returned herewith.

MEMORANDUM

The metallic samples submitted were examined specifically.

All were composed essentially of iron and chromium. Chromium was detected in the range 0.1-1.0 per cent. Nickel, cobalt, and manganese were less than 0.7 per cent.

The samples appear to be low-carbon, low-silicon ferrochrome. In this grade, chromium runs 67-71 per cent.

[The rest of the text appears to be a detailed description of a sighting, but parts are partially obscured or blacked out. The visible text describes a sighting involving lights, movement, and a location near Adams St. The witness describes seeing two light phenomena, with one potentially resembling a firefly. The location is noted as Riverdale, MD at the bottom of the page.]

The text describes a detailed observation of lights moving in an unusual manner, with descriptions of climbing, diving, and disappearing. The witness provides specific details about the movement and appearance of the lights.
