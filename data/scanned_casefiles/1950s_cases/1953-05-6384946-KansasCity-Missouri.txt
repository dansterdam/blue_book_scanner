Miners Say "Sauce" Invades Diggings, Ask OK To Shoot

BRUSH CREEK, Calif., June 24 (UP)—Two grizzled miners today asked the Butte county sheriff's office for permission to shoot at a midget-manned "flying saucer" that keeps invading their mountain diggings.

The miners, John Q. Black and John Van Allen, who operate a small gold mine in the remote Marble Creek area a few miles north of here, told Sheriff's Capt. Fred Preston the "saucer" landed twice on a sandbar at the junction of Marble and Jordan Creeks.

Each time, they said, a little man resembling a midget, got out of the contraption, scooped up a bucket of water, in a grimy pail, and handed it to someone inside. When he saw them, they said, he jumped into the "saucer" and it zoomed away, without making a sound.

"What we want to know," Black said, "is whether we have a right to shoot at it when it comes back. You see, it'll maybe only 20 and June 20 and now we're pretty sure it will come back." Preston said he told the men he couldn't give them permission to shoot at anything.

"I told them they'd better grab it next time it comes back," he said, "so they'll have something to back up their story."

The officer said he wasn't planning to make an official investigation, but said he had "informed the Air Force."

The men said the "saucer" used a tripod for a landing gear, which retracts when it takes to the air. The "saucer" left marks on the sand like elephant tracks, they said.

They described the object as being about seven feet in diameter and about four feet thick. The little man wore something like a heavy knee-length pants and his legs and arms seemed covered with a heavy tweed material, they said.

"He was as broad-shouldered as you are," Black said, pointing to Mr. Vi Beebe, owner of the Brush Creek store, said the two miners have a very good reputation and are "not drinking men."

ATTIC COMMENT:
The 19th O.S.I. District at Travis AFB, Calif., has been asked to investigate this sighting. It appears to be a hoax from its sensational flavor, but since it has received UP attention it is believed necessary for Blue Book to look into it.
