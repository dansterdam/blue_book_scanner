Miners Say "Saucüõë" Invades

Diggings, Ask OK To Shoot

BRUSH CREEK, Calif., June 24
(UP) ‚Äî Two grizzled miners to¬≠
day asked the Butte county sher¬≠
iff's office sor permission to shoot
at a midget-manned "flying sau¬≠
cer" that keeps invading their
mountain diggings.

The miners, John Q. Black and
John Van Allen, who operate a
small gold mine in the. remote
Marble Creek area a few miles
north of here, told Sheriff's Capt.
Fred Preston the "saucer" landed
twice on a sandbar at the junction
of Marble and Jordan Creeks

Each time, they said, a little
man resembling a midget got out
of the contraption, scooped up a
bucket of_ water in a shiny pail
and handed it Someone inside.

When He saw them, they said,
he jumped into the "saucer" and
it zoomed away without making
a sound

"What we want to know," Black
said, "is whether we have a right
to shoot at it whe, it comes back

You see, it the, in it on May 20
and June 20 and we feel pretty
sure it will come back MJDv."

Preston said he told the men he

couldn't give them. permission, to
shoot at anything.

"I told them they'd better grab
it next time it comes, back," he
said, "so they'll have something
to back up their story."

The officer said he wasn't plait-
ning to make-in, official investi-
gation, but said he had "informed"
the Air. Force."

The men said the ‚Äúsaucer‚Äù used
a tripod for a landing gear which
retreats when it takes to the sir.
The "saucer" left marks on the
sand like elephant tracks, the
men said.

They described the object as be¬≠
ing about seven feet in diameter
and. about four feet thick.

The little man wore something
like, a heavy "knee-length parka"
and his legs and arms seemed cov¬≠
ered with a heavy tweed material,
they said.

He was as broad-shouldered as
you are, Black said, pointing to
Preston, who is a very large matt.
Mrs. V. Beicher owner of the
Brush Creek store, said the two
miners have a very good-reputa-
tion and are "not drinking men."

ATIC COMMENT:
The 19th O.S.I. District at Travis
AFB, Calif., has been asked to inves¬≠
tigate this sighting., It appears to
be a hoax from its sensational flavor,
but since it has received UP attention
it is believed necessary for Blue Book
to look into it.
