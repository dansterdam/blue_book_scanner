55 KNOTS THE TOP OF HEIGHT RANGE INDICATOR INDICATION WAS 16, 000

FEET AND THE AVERAGE BEING 12, 000 FEET. SEE REMARKS SECTION.

NO ACFT WERE SCRAMBLED ON THIS TRACK. CIVIL AERONAUTICS

ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION AND 2 COMMERCIAL

AIRLINERS PASSING 35 MILES NORTH OF THE TRACK SEARCHED OVER IT

ON THEIR RADAR EQUIPMENT WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

THAT THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN THE TRACK WAS ONLY 3 MILES FROM

THIS STATION AND IT HAD BECOME VERY WEAK AND WAS BEGINNING

TO FADE INTO THE GROUND CLUTTER. IT ALSO WAS AT A MUCH LOWER

ALTITUDE AT THIS TIME. WE FIRST PICKED UP THIS TARGET I TALKED

TO BOTH SQUADRON (747 AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON)

AND GOATEE (653 AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON). THEY BOTH

HAD RADAR CONTACT AND BOTH ASSURED TO BE WEATHER. I DID NOT

BECOME CONCERNED WITH THE TRACK UNTIL WE HAD OBSERVED IT FOR A

MILE AND IT HAD MOVED ABOUT 42 MILES TOWARDS THIS STATION.

AT THIS TIME BOTH OTHER SITES HAD LOST CONTACT WITH IT

DUE TO RANGE. LIEUTENANT BECK WAS ON DUTY AT 747 AIRCRAFT

CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON AND LT CAHILL AT 653 AIRCRAFT

AND WARNING SQUADRON. THE TARGET WAS OBSERVED ON MPS-7 AND MPS-14

RADAR EQUIPMENT. THE SEARCH SCOPES WERE UPA-35 AND OA-175.

THE HEIGHT RANGE SCOPE WAS CA-272. NO MAINTENANCE DIFFICULTIES
HAD BEEN ENCOUNTERED RECENTLY. A THYRATRON TYPE MODULATOR IS
USED IN BOTH SETS. THE AUTOMATIC FREQUENCY RADAR CONTROL CIRCUIT
WAS OPERATING PROPERLY. THIS STATION EXPERIENCES THE USUAL INTERFERENCES
ENCOUNTERED IN RADAR AND ALL PERSONNEL ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT.
ALL PERSONNEL ARE FAMILIAR WITH OP ON THE EQUIPMENT USED.
THERE WAS NO AP EXTENDING THE GROUND CLUTTER AT THE TIME OF THE
OBSERVATION. THE TARGET WAS MUCH LARGER THAN NORMAL TRAFFIC
RADAR RETURNS. WHEN FIRST OBSERVED IT WAS 10 MILES IN DIAMETER
AND AS IT APPROACHED THIS STATION IT ELONGATED BECOMING 15
MILES LONG AND 12 MILES WIDE. NO OTHER TARGETS WERE OBSERVED
NEAR THIS ONE. I INTERROGATED MOTEL ON IDENTIFICATION FRIEND
OR FOE LOOKING FOR STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND AIRCRAFT WITH NEGATIVE
RESULTS. PLANNED POSITION INDICATOR TYPE SCOPES WERE USED.
GIVING A STRONG SIGNAL AT FIRST. TO BETTER OBSERVE THE TARGET I
OFF CENTERED AND EXPANDED OUT A UPA-3 TO A RANGE OF 52 MILES.
THE SIGNAL WAS LIGHT YELLOW IN ITS ENTIRE AREA OF GROUPS OF
SMALL INTENSE SPOTS. THE SIGNAL BECAME WEAKER WHEN IT REACHED
LAND AND IN THE END BEFORE IT FADED IN THE GROUND CLUTTER THE
SIGNAL WAS NOTHING BUT A GROUP OF SMALL INTENSE SPOTS. A SCAN RATE OF
5 REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE WAS USED. THE FREQUENCY OF THE SEARCH WAS
1295 MEGACYCLES AND THE RANGE INDICATOR 27.35 MEGACYCLES.
REMARKS: THE REASONS FOR MY CONCERN ON THIS TRACK WERE
(1) IT SEEMED UNLIKELY THAT THIS WAS WEATHER MOVING SO FAST AND ALL

STATIONS WERE FOLLOWING CLEAR WEATHER, (2) THE POSSIBILITY OF
CHAFF WAS CONSIDERED BUT THE HEIGHT RANGE INDICATOR INDICATION
WAS 10, 300 FEET LONG AND 15 MILES WIDE MAKING IT SEEM
UNLIKELY TO BE CHAFF. FURTHERMORE, CHAFF SURELY WOULD HAVE DISPERSED
MORE IN THE DISTANCE. IT TRAVELLED UNDER OBSERVATION.
AN OTHER UNUSUAL FACT WAS THAT IT STEADILY DECREASED IN ALTITUDE
ENDING UP AT ABOUT 3000 FEET BEFORE IT FADED. IT ALSO SLOWED
TO 5.9 KNOTS UPON REACHING LAND. 3 HOURS AFTER THE TRACK HAD
FADED IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE CURVATURE OF EARTH CORRECTION
DUE HEIGHT RANGE INDICATOR WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.
THIS MAKES OUR ALTITUDES IN ERROR. THE ERROR INCREASED WITH RANGE.
BY EXPERIMENTATION I FOUND THE ERROR TO BE 15, 300 FEET AT THE
RANGE OF INITIAL PLOT. THEREFORE, THE INITIAL RANGE MUST HAVE BEEN
51, 322 FEET INSTEAD OF 16, 322 FEET. THE ALTITUDES CLOSER IN THE
STATION ARE SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE

Attn: Capt. Hoffman

1. Request the attached 1-a reports, together with
scope plot and photographs be reviewed, and an
analysis made by ATIC with respect to these shots.

2. Detailed report on these sightings covering "Pending"
electronic report, with their place and date in control
points from the location, USAF or other, as per listings.

3. With regard to the latter report, it is noted that
these UFO's large segment of photo indicates
yet it appears that no attempt was made to trace
itself.

4. This office should like to bring to your attention,
that in contrast to the present procedure which we
are now following, it would be useful, in our opinion,
a system which would enable us to submit, in future,
such material with more rapid analysis by your office.

5. In our discussion with the project was not in effect
that this report had been put into his possession
and that it would be submitted with analysis reports,
for this is being or will be done. However, it is noted
that this is being or will be done.

1.    The subject report, submitted by 657 ACWRON, Houm, Alabama, refers to a target "15 miles long and 10 miles wide" lacking any visual observation of so huge a target, and inability of airborne radars to pick up the target (while searching the area for it) at 35 miles, must be considered as obviously a false return on the radar. Just what caused this false return is not known, and while the weather may not move fast, the results of such weather changes frequently do move at very high rates of speed, due to reflection, and the angles at which the signals are reflected. Returns such as the one under discussion usually are due to phenomena brought about by some weather condition. The fact that no aircraft were searched for such an unusual target indicates there must have been compelling doubts in the minds of the operating personnel as to the authenticity of the said targets.
