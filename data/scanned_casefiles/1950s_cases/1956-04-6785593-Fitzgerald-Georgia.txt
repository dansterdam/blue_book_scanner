GENERAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT

FROM(AG ENCY)    Flight 2-G, 4602d AISS     REPORT NO. 26-UFOB-1-56     Part One     PAGE 2 OF 4     PAGES

I. SOURCE:
Address: Post Office Box [redacted], Fitzgerald, Georgia
Age: 33
Occupation: County Forest Ranger
Qualifications: CCC Observer

II. RELIABILITY: Because of lack of conflict with reports of other informant, Source may be considered fairly reliably.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 16/1800Z Apr 56, Source (FO Jim Morris) (See Part II) asked Source to come to National Guard Armory at Fitzgerald, Ga. (CJGB 4543) to observe an object which appeared to be hovering approximately overhead. It was located about half way between the sun and the moon at 16/181552, It appeared motionless and when observed through binoculars (Army M-1 Type), it gave off a glare which made shape determination difficult. It could have been round or oblong. It was visible with the naked eye, and "shined like a star"

Object was observed periodically throughout the afternoon and appeared to be moving in a westerly direction. At sundown, at elevation 45 degrees due west. After dark it appeared as a bright star.

Between 16/1930Z and 16/2000Z, Source observed two aircraft at high altitude (one higher than the other) (Confirmed see Part II). Object appeared to be much higher than either aircraft.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with D/I 35th AIRDIV disclosed that Source reported sighting to filter center at Maxwell AFB which, in turn, forwarded the report to GOC 35th AIRDIV.

2. 35th AIRDIV Weather furnished the following data for time of sighting:
   a. Winds:
      Altitude        Wind Velocity    Wind Direction
      40,000 ft       85-100 knots     270 deg
      30,000 ft       85 knots         270-250 deg
      20,000 ft       75 knots         270 deg

   b. Other conditions: CAVU

3. Flight Service Center, Maxwell AFB, reported no unusual reports from aircraft.

4. The 702d ACWRON reported the following plots in the area during period of sighting:
   TIME        GEORGE    NO. ACFT  ALT     SPEED       DIRECTION
   a. 1834Z    GJGB 5833 1         19,000  320 knots   South
      1836Z    GJGB 5850 1         19,000  320 knots   North
   b. 1935Z    GJGB 4020 1         20,000  350 knots   South
   c. 1955Z    GJGB 5642 1         14,000  3000 knots  East

5. A visit with Dr. Calder of the Bradley Observatory, Decatur, Georgia disclosed that the route taken by the object strangely indicated that Venus was the object visible during daylight hours during this time of the year. Indecision of Source as to the shape of the object can be attributed to the fact that Venus now appears as a halfmoon. Venus was personally observed by the Investigator through a 185X telescope.

6. CWO Jim Morris, administrator for National Guard Armory, Fitzgerald, Georgia, was contacted by phone. His report concurred in all respects with that submitted by Source.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably
caused by the planet Venus for the following reasons:

    a. The description, location of the object, height, and length of
    time observed indicated the Source was viewing the planet Venus.

    b. Doctor Calder, Professor of Physics and Astronomy, and Director of
    Bradley Observatory, Agnes Scott College, Decatur, Georgia, verified the opinion
    of the Preparing Officer.

                                            THADDEUS W. KALLINI
                                            Capt., USAF
                                            Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was
astronomically in nature. Due to the westwardly flight path of the object, the
duration of the sighting, and the correlation of the flight path of the object
as compared to the path of Venus, it is the opinion of this headquarters that
this sighting was definitely caused by the planet Venus.
