GENERAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT 
FROM(AG-ENCY): # 112-ANG-AP 46020A AISS

I. SOURCE:
Address: Post Office Box - , Fitzgerald, Georgia 
Age: 33
Occupation: County Forest Ranger
Qualifications: GCG OBSERVER

II. RELIABILITY:
Because of lack of conflict with reports of other informants, source may be considered fairly reliable.

III. SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
At approximately 16/1300Z APR 56, source's GCG Jim Morris (see Part II) asked source to come to National Guard Armory at Fitzgerald, Ga. (GCG 1/2) to observe an object which appeared to be hovering approximately overhead. It was located about halfway between the sun and the moon at 16/1314Z. It appeared motionless and when observed through binoculars it seemed to be round or oblong. It was visible with the naked eye, and without either binocular or telescope.

Object was observed periodically throughout the afternoon and appeared to be moving in a west-to-east direction. At dusk it was at elevation 45 degrees due west. After dark it appeared as a bright star.

Between 16/1930Z and 16/2000Z, source observed two aircraft at high altitude (one higher than the other) (confirmed see Part II). Object appeared to be much higher than either aircraft.

PART TWO OF PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check with D/I 35th AIRDIV disclosed that Source reported sighting to AIRDIV center, & Marshal ABS which in turn forwarded the report to CIC 35th.
2. 35th AIRDIV Weather furnished the following data for time of sighting:
a. Winds: Altitude 40,000 ft 85-100 knots, 30,000 ft 85 knots, 20,000 ft 75 knots
b. Other conditions: GAVU
3. Flight Service Center, Maxwell AFB, reported no unusual reports from aircraft.
4. The 702d ACWRON reported the following plots in the area during period of sighting:
a. TIME 18342 - GEORGE 5833, NO. ACFT 1, ALT 19,000, SPEED 320 knots, DIRECTION South
b. 19352 - GJGB 4020, 1, 20,000, 350 knots, South
c. 19552 - GJGB 5342, 1, 14,000, 360 knots, East
5. A visit with Dr. Calder of the Bradley Observatory, Decatur, Georgia disclosed that the route taken by the object strongly indicates that it was Venus which was visible during daylight hours during this time of the year. Indication now appears as a half-moon. Venus was personally observed by the investigator through a 1952 telescope.
6. CWO Jim Morris, administrator for National Guard Armory, Fitzgerald, Georgia, was contacted by phone. His report concurred in all respects with that submitted by Source.

(CLASSIFICATION)

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT

FROM:(A-2-OCT.)
Flight 2-G, 46024 AISS

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by the planet Venus for the following reason:
2. The description, location of the object, height, and length of time observed indicated the source was viewing the planet Venus.
b. Doctor Galder, Professor of Physics and Astronomy, and Director of
Bradley Observatory, Agnes Scott College, Decatur, Georgia, verified the opinion of the Preparing Officer.

THADDEUS W. KALLINI
Capt.
USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was astronomical in nature. Due to the westwardly flight path of the object, the duration of the sighting, and the correlation of the flight path of the object as compared to the path of Venus, it is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was definitely caused by the planet Venus.
