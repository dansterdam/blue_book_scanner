The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during the 1950s. The document is a Project 10073 Record Card that provides details about a UFO sighting that occurred on June 9, 1951, in Mikkeli, Finland.

The image appears to contain a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is an "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" dated September 20, 1951 regarding an incident in Mikkeli, Finland. However, there is no visible photograph or image within this particular page of the document.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Flying Saucer - KEKLAND

DATE OF INFORMATION: 24 September 1951
PLACE: Mikkeli, Finland
OBSERVERS: Le Col Howard T. Van de Graaf, Air Attache

SUMMARY: (Fact and opinion expressed in statement - a brief and concise as possible).

1. Lt. Kalimeri, who is generally residing in Kuopio, Finland, gave the following information:

a. On 20 September 1951, at approximately 2030 hours, he and 3 others had observed a flying saucer over Mikkeli Finland, which appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed at an estimated altitude of 6,000 meters.

b. The object was round shaped with a red light in the center. It was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it disappeared from sight. The observers estimated its size to be approximately 4-5 meters in diameter.

c. The observers stated that when the object first appeared, it was traveling from the north toward the south, but later changed direction and traveled toward the east, finally disappearing in a northeasterly direction. The speed was estimated to be in the vicinity of 700 to 1,000 km/hr.

d. Lt. Kalimeri stated that he believed this object was under control, as it changed direction several times. He assured that this was because he could see only the underside at the time of observation.

2. PARTS of Preparatory Analyze:

a. Since this was a relatively short period of observation, it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion. However, taking into consideration the following factors:

1) The reported speed of 700-1,000 km/hr at an estimated altitude of 6,000 meters.
2) The reported diameter of 4-5 meters.
3) The reported change of direction.

It seems that this is a phenomenon that deserves further investigation, especially in view of the fact that several reliable observers reported the incident.
