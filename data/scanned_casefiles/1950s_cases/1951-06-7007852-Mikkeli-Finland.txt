AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

AREA LOCATION: Finland
PLACE: Finland

DATE OF WRITING: 21 September 1951
DATE OF INFORMATION: 20 September 1951

FROM (Agency): Office of Air Attach√©, Helsinki, Finland
SOURCE: Mr.

1. Mr. [redacted] Ex-Finnish Minister to [redacted], graduate of [redacted], who business was presently residing in Kuopio, Finland, gave the following information:

2. He stated that he had observed a flying saucer near Mikkeli, Finland at 2000 hours on 9 June 1951 (at this season daylight lasts until about 2300, at which time only a twilight type occurred). He was in the open country, some 25 km north of Mikkeli, was flying at an estimated altitude of 3,000 meters, or about 10,000 feet, or in the northwest toward the southeast, or in the direction of Leningrad. The craft was described as being a perfect disc, metallic silver in color, with no visible windows. Source estimated that it was flying at a speed of 800 km/hr, or much faster, and was not blinking. He was unable to see any occupancy but assumed that this was because he could see only the underneath side.

3. Mr. [redacted] said that his observation was made while he was driving on the road north of Mikkeli with his wife and that the "first point" was few or several kilometers from Mikkeli. At that time there were broken clouds and the craft was flying through a layer of clouds in the overcast. Source stated that he could hear a definitely no motor noise. He further stated that in the last year particularly there had been a type of propulsion was used that definitely indicated something other than a normal jet or propeller noise.

4. Since this man is a graduate engineer (field unknown) and was conscious of being anything but a crackpot, it is felt that this report warrants further investigation. The cloudy sky could possibly with reasonable probability suggested as possible reasons for the fact that this flight has been unverified to this date.
