DETAILS:

1. This investigation initiated by direction of District Commander, 19th District OSI (IO) USAF, Travis Air Force Base, California, based upon information received from Mr. [redacted], Civilian employee, Naval Supply Annex, Stockton, California to the effect that he and several other persons had seen a rectangular object over the Naval Supply Annex at approximately 1240 hours, 22 May 1952, which object seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.

AT STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA

2. On 22 May 1952, [redacted] was interviewed at which time he stated substantially as follows:

At approximately 1240 hours, 22 May 1952, [redacted] was contacted by a co-worker and informed that [redacted] observed an object in the sky which seemed to be hovering at a very high altitude. At this time [redacted] went outside of the building in which he was working, accompanied by [redacted] in the sky. [redacted] stated that at which time he observed an object pointed out the object in the sky. [redacted] stated that the object was approximately 30,000 feet altitude, bright silver in color, appearing rectangular in shape, which object remained almost stationary. Detailed that he visually placed the object in relation to the edge of a building so as to determine drift, rise and motion. For a period of four (4) minutes, the object remained stationary, then disappeared. The object was last seen at 1305 hours, and advised that the object did not fly away, but merely disappeared from sight. [redacted] stated that according to his estimate, the object was on a horizontal azimuth of approximately 350 degrees and on a vertical angle of 85 degrees.

3. On 22 May 1952, Mr. [redacted] was interviewed at which time he stated that on 22 May 1952 as he was proceeding along a side walk in the vicinity of the Supply Annex, he noticed several persons looking into the sky. [redacted] stated that upon looking up he observed what appeared to be a round shaped object very high in the sky in a northerly direction. [redacted] stated that he continued to observe the object for a period of two to five minutes after which the object disappeared. [redacted] declared that he was almost certain that the object was a weather balloon. [redacted] explained that he had seen a number of weather balloons released from Ordinance Depots, and in his opinion the object in the sky was definitely the same type.

4. [redacted], employee of the Navy at the Naval Supply Annex, Stockton, California was contacted at his home, Stockton, California. Mr. [redacted] advised that he is employed as an Assistant Division Supervisor (Ordnance) at the Naval Supply Annex. He stated his attention was called to an object moving shortly before 1300 hours 22 May 1952, by another employee. He stated there was no telescope available or any other instrument with which to look at the object, besides being partially obscured by trees appearing to be a globe having no wing or tail assembly and was of a silvery color. He looked at the

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

AREA REPORTED Stockton, Unidentified Flying Object (UFOB)
LOCATION Stockton, California
DATE OF SIGHTING 22 May 52     DATE OF INFORMATION 22 May 52     MADE BY Directorate of Intelligence

In accordance with AFR 200-5, Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting, the following report is forwarded:

At 1240 PWT an unidentified aerial object was sighted in the sky at an estimated altitude of 30,000 ft over the Stockton Naval Supply Station, Stockton, California.

There was only one (1) object observed, it being bright silver in color and rectangular in shape. A group of eight (8) people observed the object and reported the incident to Maj. Robert T. Stimson, Army Instructor of the 49th Infantry Division, California National Guard.

A civilian, Mr. [redacted], who is also an Army Reserve captain, took a reading by using established rectangular coordinates which he estimated to be at 30,000 ft; vertical azimuth 850; horizontal azimuth 350.

The object was visible for a period of 25 minutes, then faded away.

Winds aloft were as follows: 10,000 ft, 30° at 20 knots; 20,000, 360° at 30 knots; 30,000, 360° at 30 knots.

The Stockton Interstate Air Weather Station, Stockton, California was queried via weather balloons sent aloft during the period of 2400 Hours 21 May and 2100 hours 22 May 1952. Results were negative.

An interscope was attempted on two radar screens at lower altitudes (5000 ft.) by two F-89 aircraft at approximately 1300 hours, but tracks faded before contact was made.
