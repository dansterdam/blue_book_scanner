TO: AFCIN-484        FROM: AFCIN-481        DATE: 17 Dec 57        COMMENT NR 2
                                                AFCIN-481/V. D. Bryant/3g

1. The speed of the targets (60-70 mph), the way in which they faded out at 15-20 N.M., and the inference in par. 11 that migratory ducks have been observed on the radar before, tend to indicate that this is a possible explanation in this case.

2. With reference to the IFF sighting, WADC IFF project engineers who were contacted consider it highly improbable that the return (which was tracked) could be other than from an aircraft having a transponder installed. The fact that this particular target had a speed of about 200 mph seems to bear out this supposition. IFF equipment is now carried in small Army aircraft, as well as Civil Air Patrol planes having speeds compatible to the speed observed.

10. at 06152 jet aircraft at 20,000' was sighted southbound visually.

11. Altitude was reported by control tower. Grover C. Walker, Capt, USAF, 312FBM, Intelligence Officer. Possibility of these GCA tracking being misguided (subs) not discounted, however, this would not explain the IFF sightings.
