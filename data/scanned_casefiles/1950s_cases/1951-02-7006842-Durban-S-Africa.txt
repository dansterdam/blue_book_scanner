TORPEDO SHAPE IN SKY

Three Europeans and some Natives saw a torpedo-shaped object travelling slowly over the Point area of Durban shortly before 5 o'clock this morning.

Mr. [redacted], Glenwood, told the Daily News "We were coming off night shift and with two companions I was sitting at the Lowry Hotel in this trailer full of Natives. As the lorry stopped at the corner of Point Road and Windor Street I looked up through the windscreen and saw something like a torpedo-shaped object slowly overhead towards the Bluff. I called my companion's attention to it and asked the time. It was 4.55.

"It was beautifully colored, the front part being bright red, the centre dark red and the end bright red. There was no noise and no trail. Like I could stop, and although I have seen thousands of shooting stars I will swear it was not a star for it was travelling parallel to the ground and not dropping like a star.

"It was by far the prettiest thing I have ever seen in the sky and we watched it for about 15 or 20 minutes. A minute before it passed out of sight, going in the direction of the Bluff.

"With me in the lorry was Mr. [redacted], and a driver whose name I'm not sure of. The Natives were very excited by this lovely thing in the sky"

OTHERS SAW "TORPEDO" OBJECT

The torpedo-shaped object reported to have been seen flying over Durban early yesterday morning was also seen by passengers waiting for a train at Marebank station.

Mr. [redacted] of [redacted] Marebank, says a group of people were standing on the platform waiting for the 5 am. train when the object was seen in the sky over the sea in the Isipingo area.

He says: "It was exactly the same as the description given by me in the Daily News yesterday but the color to me appeared to be blue. It was a most beautiful sight. It looked like a ball when I first saw it, and then it gradually became elongated, finally finally it disappeared in the sky somewhere near Reunion Rocks. There was no noise and the object seemed to be at a low altitude traveling slowly."

Mr. Douglas Robertson, a Durban astronomer, says that although he did not see the object himself, the possibility of it being a comet can definitely be ruled out. The reports say this object traveled up the coast, and comets are known to travel only from west to east.
