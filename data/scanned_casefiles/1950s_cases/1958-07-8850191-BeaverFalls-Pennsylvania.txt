Handwritten notes at bottom:
"Sows 'slow speed' and 'small size' are too general, and there are missing. Does not give location where object was 1st observed, only that it moved to SW direction.

Although a slow movement is a straight line at 6000 ft (or some hgt) logically indicates an aircraft movement.

There is INSUFFICIENT DATA to properly conclude or evaluate etc."
