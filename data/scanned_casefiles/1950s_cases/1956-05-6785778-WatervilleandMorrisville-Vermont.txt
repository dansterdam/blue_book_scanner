SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:

1. A telephone call to the Burlington Airport control tower was made to determine if there were any aircraft in the area on the dates and times of sightings. Tower gave a negative report.

2. Phone call was made to the Burlington weather station. No balloons releases were made at the time of sightings or immediately prior to the time of sightings. Personnel at the station informed the investigator that the winds at altitude were from the NW on both dates, and it was possible for balloons to travel from the north central part of the states into the area.

3. A check was made with the 764th AC&W Squadron, St. Albans, Vermont. Intelligence personnel informed the investigator or several projects being conducted involving the use of balloons. Investigator was shown track logs made on the dates of the sightings, but no entries were made which would identify the objects sighted.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. It is the opinion of the Investigator, from facts obtained, that sightings were caused by a cluster of weather balloons, with telemetering instruments attached. These balloons could possibly be used in conjunction with OPERATION SKYHOOK, as the prevailing winds would cause them to be blown over the area where they were sighted. The weather station at Burlington, Vermont has seen similar sightings within the past eight (8) months and has determined them to be weather balloons.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sightings described in this report were caused by clusters of weather balloons. Telemetering instruments attached to the suspension train of each balloon could account for reports of "gondolas" beneath the objects.

II. RELIABILITY: Mr. Wiltshire has no previous experience as a trained observer. He is middle aged and possesses average intelligence. He seemed sincere in presenting his information.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Mr. [redacted] was on duty with the Morrisville GOC Post (GEORGE: HJCQ 243L) which is located in the town of Morrisville, Vt. Wiltshire's tour of duty was from 2000 to 2200 hrs EST on the 6th of May 56 and 13th of May 56 respectively. The objects were called to an attention by Mr. Fred Green, Manager of the Morrisville Foundry, who had been called by an unknown SOURCE in Waterville, Vermont (GEORGE HJCQ 142).

Mr. Wiltshire stated that he saw six (6) of the objects in the sighting of 6 May 56 but did not know their bearing from his location. Two (2) of the objects were directly overhead and appeared brighter than the other four (4). Objects were located approximately 350 above the horizon and 80 to the left of the other two (2) objects. The weather was clear with few scattered clouds, no winds, cool and dry. There was no moonlight and few stars. The objects were approximately the size of a grape fruit and the two (2) directly overhead were approxi- mately the size of a dime. Objects were very faint and seemed to remain suspended. Objects were triangular shaped with a small tail suspended beneath. (See Incl 1). One object moved behind a cloud and re-appeared. All objects appeared solid and had distinct edges. The smaller objects appeared as a bright star, but retained a clear outline. Objects were in the same position when Mr. Wiltshire left his post at 2200 hours EST, 6 May 56.

Mr. Wiltshire's sighting on 13 May 56 was similar to the sighting of 6 May 56 with the exception that only four (4) objects were observed. Mr. Wiltshire was facing north at the time of the sighting and observed only one (1) object move. He did not remember the direction of flight. The moon was out on the evening of the 13 May 56. The objects were fanned out across the sky from east to west. Western most object was approximately 150 from north and south; 200 above the horizon. Two objects were located close together at due north from Mr. Wiltshire's position. These objects were approximately 350 above the horizon. The eastern most object was moving very fast in an approximate easterly direction and when first observed was located about 150 east of north.
