The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text in the document describes the observer's account of seeing two objects moving across the sky in an ESE direction, one traveling in a straight line and the other in a curved path. The observer also mentions hearing no sound from the objects and seeing a meteor-like object streak across the sky at night, which they believe was the explanation for what they observed earlier.

The text in the document is as follows:

At about 1600-1620 hours, Sunday, 27 July 1952, I looked up at the chimney of my house and my attention was attracted by two objects moving across the sky in an ESE direction, one traveling in a straight line and one in a curved path.

Called to my wife, but she was behind corner of house and could not get around in time to see them. 

They appeared as silvery-white spots, similar to the specular reflection of sunlight on distant rural aircraft. No trails were visible. Appeared to be decreasing altitude while in view, but this is difficult to judge because of the aspect. Impossible to estimate altitude because of lack of knowledge of size or shape of objects.

Listened intently for sound (although timing the delay would have given no good clue to the range because of the rate at which they crossed over) but heard none. First thought was that they were a couple F-94's chasing around at high altitude, which I have seen before upon occasion (there were F-94's in the area before and after this time, but flying at rather low speed and altitude) but quickly realized that no aircraft could go that fast.

In fact, the only thing I have ever seen traverse the sky at such a rate was a meteor at night. This would seem to me to be the best explanation of what I saw: a meteor, broken into two pieces burning brightly enough to be seen in the bright daylight except for the radically curved path described by me of the objects.

Transcription of text in the document:

United States Aeronautical Dept.,
Washington, D.C.
(Attendicator Say Phenomena.)
Gentlemen,

Someplace in the papers I have seen a report of our laboratories producing, technically, missile speeds or 350 times velocity of sound.

About 8.30 P.M. or thereabout, there appeared TWO flying objects near my home, travelling fast, one was diving NORTH from Sunnyvale towards my home, and the other was travelling South and approaching paralled. One I mentioned to a companion "Wow, that's real flying". This object suddenly disappeared as it seemed to go into a kind of maneuver that was a magic, "Wow, he's gone", and was reported as flying saucers and no following. 

I first noted these two objects through my windshield and as we were in the twilight darkness, I was one of the impression, that which caused in my mind an impression, that which caused in my mind an impression of a similarity to the searchlight beam in their movements.

Further my impression was that the two objects were flying either at a similar or at possibly 40 miles high, in which event 1000 M.P.H. would not have been an observation. 

It did not notice chance those two objects come across the sky from any particular source. They simply appeared in the sky, and went behind the horizon in very short minute, they both slowly turned and melted away. It might not be any value or use or even inconsequent, but it also is my presumption that any eye witness to sky phenomena would not claim to seen much of other. In event some of course, our Government is doing many things in avition of which I as Citizen Layman know nothing. In event some one has under observation high flying objects, we better find a way to stop its production or we will be having bugs in our structure shown to country.

Yours truly,
[SIGNATURE]

Preparing office:  ACOFS, G2, Port Monmouth, New Jersey
Subject:  Unconventional Aircraft

1. At approximately 0930 hours on 1 July 1952, MEIER, Norman John, Badge #20095, Military Intelligence Division, advised G2, Port Monmouth, New Jersey, the presence of two unconventional aircraft at a height of approximately 50 thousand feet directly over the Port Monmouth area.

It was further stated that at approximately 0920 hours on 1 July 1952, the students under his supervision were engaged in tracking on Radar Set SCR 584, 8 or 9 conventional aircraft, a number of which were jet propelled, when two unidentified objects were sighted at a higher altitude.

MEIER further stated that a number of these objects appeared to suspend a period of approximately 5 minutes after which it took off with a terrific burst of speed in a southeasterly direction. He stated that these objects displayed a speed of 2 to 4 times in excess of the conventional aircraft previously sighted. 

At approximately 0933 hours on 1 July 1952, Sheldon P. de BAUN, Agent, G2, Port Monmouth, New Jersey, immediately investigated the information related from Meier and was advised by Agent de BAUN that he had contacted PIPER, Wilfred, Lt. Col., Commanding Officer, 616 AC and W Squadron, United States Air Force, Highlands, New Jersey.

Mr. KILPATRICK further advised Agent de BAUN to recontact MEIER for additional information and to confirm the reported altitude of the sighted objects.

At approximately 0936 hours on 1 July 1952, Agent de BAUN contacted Col. HYPER at Highlands, New Jersey and was advised by Col. HYPER that the Air Force was conducting maneuvers in that area.

At approximately 0933 hours, Agent de BAUN recontacted MEIER and was assured by MEIER that the reported objects were at an altitude of approximately 50 thousand feet. MEIER further advised Agent de BAUN that the 12 men comprising his class or instructor had visually sighted these two objects and had noted that the vapor trails emitting from the conventional aircraft within the immediate vicinity was missing.

2. At approximately 1520 hours on 1 July 1952, MEIER again reported to ACOFS, G2, the presence of 12 unconventional aircraft directly over Port Monmouth area at an altitude of approximately 40 to 50 thousand yards.

Date of Investigation: 23 July 1952. Case sumary supplemental to ATIC Case No. 3647
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting near Palmyra, Pa.
On 23 July 1952, an F-94 fighter aircraft from Greater Pittsburgh Airport photographed an unidentified object near Palmyra, Pa., during an air scramble. The object could not be identified from the photograph.
This supplementary report provides additional details of the incident:
l. The case was investigated by ATIC on 23 July 1952. The object was photographed by a motion picture camera in the F-94 fighter aircraft while the pilot was engaged in an air scramble of the object.
2. The pilot reported visual contact with an unidentified object.
3. The object was described as a bright, shiny, silver-colored object which appeared to be stationary and approximately 30,000 feet in altitude.
4. No additional information substantiated or supplemented the existing ATIC case file on this incident.

At 9:00 a.m., July 29, 1952, the FBI representative at Madison, Wisconsin, was contacted by representatives of OSI, Maxwell Field, Madison, Wisconsin. They advised that a strange device had been found in an open field near Madison, Wisconsin. The device was reported to have "MISS" stamped on it. The device was found by two boys, both of Palmyra, Wisconsin. Both boys are twenty-one years old.

Agents from the Madison Resident Agency proceeded to Palmyra. It was determined that the device is two inches in diameter and is dark yellow color. It was found with a string attached to it. A search was made into the field around where the device was found. There were no appreciable "burned" marks in the field. The device is cylindrical in shape and looks something like a tip of a bomb, and the string attached to it is approximately ten inches in length and was attached to the device. The device is four inches long and has one-eighth inch thick walls. It is made of a dark material which appears to be a poor quality steel or iron protruded from material that was hardened and used in the device where it was attached to the string.

Mr. of Palmyra advised that on Sunday, July 27, 1952, at about 9:30 a.m., he observed a strange light in the sky for about 15 minutes. He watched this light, which appeared to him to be about the size of a basketball, moving rapidly across the sky from east to west. He stated that the light gave off a bright reddish glow. It was his opinion that this light was not an airplane, as it moved too rapidly and at a constant altitude.

Preparations are being made by the Milwaukee Office to forward the device to the Technical Laboratory for appropriate examination.

REPORT OF UNKNOWN FLYING OBJECT

ADIC 23 July 1952
SUBJECT: Report of Unknown Body Flying over Lake Charles Air Force Base.

TO: Commanding Officer  
5064th AIR DIVISION
Lake Charles Air Force Base
Lake Charles, Louisiana

ATTN: Intelligence Officer

About 2330 central standard time, a weather observer, experienced with civilian and military aircraft, spotted an object traveling at an excessive rate of speed, estimated at 5,000 feet. The object was traveling from South to North over the Air Force Base. In our opinion, no conventional aircraft would be capable of such speeds (5,000 feet per second). The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 seconds and seemed to hang and disappear completely. No sound was heard.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:
1. At approximately 0930 hours on 1 July 1952, METER, Norman John, Badge #2009, Military Instructor, Radar Division, Enlisted Department, The Signal School, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, reported to ACOFS, G-2, Fort Monmouth, the presence of two unconventional aircraft at a height of approximately 50 thousand feet directly over the Fort Monmouth area.
METER stated that at approximately 0930 hours on 1 July 1952, the students under his supervision observed two unconventional aircraft, a number of which were jet propelled, when two unidentified objects were sighted at a higher altitude.
METER further stated that one of these objects appeared to suspend motion for a period of approximately 5 minutes after which it took off in a southeasterly direction. He stated that these objects displayed a speed in excess of the conventional aircraft presently used.
At approximately 0933 hours on 1 July 1952, Sheldon P. de BAAL, Agent, G-2, Fort Monmouth, transmitted via telephone the information received from METER to Capt. KILPATRICK, ACOFS, G-2, Headquarters, 1st Army, Governors Island, New York.
Capt. de BAUN was advised by Capt. KILPATRICK to contact PIER, Liaison Officer, 609th GCI and 1 Squadron, United States Air Force, Highlands, New Jersey.
Mr. KILPATRICK further advised Agent de BAAL to recontact METER for additional information and to confirm the reported attitude of the sighted objects.
At approximately 0936 hours on 1 July 1952, Agent de BAAL contacted Col. PIPER at Highlands, New Jersey and was advised by Col. PIPER that the Air Force was conducting maneuvers in the vicinity of the Fort Monmouth area that date.
At approximately 0938 hours, Agent de BAAL recontacted METER and was assured by METER that the 12 men comprising his class of instruction had visually sighted these two objects emitting from the unconventional aircraft within the immediate vicinity was missing from the conventional aircraft.
At approximately 1520 hours on 1 July 1952, METER again reported to ACOFS, G-2, the presence of 12 unconventional aircraft directly over the Fort Monmouth area at an altitude of approximately 40 to 50 thousand yards.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
COUNTRY: U.S.A.
SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Objects
AREA: Milkwaukee, Wisconsin
DATE OF INFO: 29 Jul 1952
DATE OF REPORT: 22 Aug 1952
EVALUATION: Individual as listed below

SUMMARY: (Some details omitted or illegible) On the 28th of July 1952, at 1915 CST, Mr... (illegible) of the 440th AC&W Squadron, Williams Bay, Wisc., observed five (5) objects flying at a very high altitude in the vicinity of Milwaukee. The objects appeared to be circular in shape, in the (500) size range, and were traveling at an estimated altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet. The objects were moving at a fast rate of speed, were operating individually, and showed no exhaust or contrails. All maneuvering of the objects was abrupt and erratic. The aerial phenomena was observed for a period of 15 to 20 minutes.

The visual sighting was confirmed by radar. The range of the objects was 3,500 to 4,500 yards. At one point, the objects formed a circular pattern and then separated to individual flight. The radar operator stated that the blips were very clear and distinct. The altitude shown by the radar was 20,000 to 25,000 feet.

Aircraft reported flying were two-way planes in the local area.

1. 0920 As I was walking past the radar range, Col. Smith and Hartlage reported that several students besides themselves were seeing strange objects in the sky which they considered to be peculiar. They noticed these objects at about 2,000 yards. This was not seen by me.

2. 0925 I immediately questioned Smith and Hartlager and after noticing their seriousness, gathered together all who reportedly saw the objects took them to my office in Bldg. 900.

3. 0927 I called Mr. Sheldon De Brun of Security and Vigilance and told him what happened and requested that he either call Col. Smith and Hartlager or have someone else do so and obtain more details in order to evaluate the objects seen overhead in the vicinity of other aircraft. These objects were seen by 12 men. This was as per orders regarding any unusual sky observations.

4. 0930 I reported the incident to Capt. Miracles in the Radar Division Headquarters, Bldg. 913.

5. 0935 I immediately began taking notes and statements from all who were involved in the incident.

6. 0938 Mr. Sheldon De Brun called back and reported that he had contacted Maj. Gen. Air Force Base and that this was all they could tell him.

7. 0943 Capt. Miracles and Capt. Dickerman came to my office in Bldg. 913 and questioned the students who saw the objects. They ordered photographs be taken but this was not possible since the objects had disappeared.

8. 0943 Students prepared their statements.

9. 1105 The complete report was submitted to Capt. Miracles, read by Lt. Col. Dunbar, and then handed to Sgt. Major Meek for typing.

1 JULY 52

I was standing beside an AN/FPS Radar van talking with a group of men when one of the men said: "Look up there". I looked overhead and immediately spotted an object that looked similar to a table tennis ball at a large distance away. It was overhead and traveling at a very rapid rate. The object turned the north (seeming) turning toward the west. The size of the object became smaller as it increased distance and became lost behind a telephone pole and a building. The sky was very clear and very good visibility.

While watching several jets and their vapor trails, I noticed what looked like a star at a greater altitude. By watching it for awhile it seemed to move back and forth. So I went over to a GCA site and told them to try and track the object. While they were setting up on the UFO some of them picked up these objects straight overhead. So they set in auto-tracking on them, it appeared to be several objects of the "VT" people and the clutter was about 15,000 yds. The antenna swept about 1800 and they lost them. So I returned back to the MPG and they said there was another object overhead so we watched it for a while then it took off in a northward direction and passed the jets which were almost out of sight. Then I lost it.

STATEMENT OF: PFC MARTINELLI

We happened to be looking at jet planes and accidently seen a white disc in the air about 20,000 feet. The disc seem to be still then when at a terrific speed towards the south. We then took the speed of the disc compare with the jets and it seem to be that the disc was going faster than the jets. In less than 1 minute it was reported it to Mr. Miles.

Mr. Miles then asked us questions about it, he then told some of us man to go back and see if we could see any more of them. I then came back and get a polaroid from one of the JPO. I kept looking for one about ten minutes and then seen one come from the north going towards the south. The disc seem to be going at a terrific speed much greater than a jet plane. This happen at 1600.

STATEMENT OF: Pvt Carroll H. Rush Jr.
1 July 1952

While watching airplanes maneuvering I noticed an object almost directly overhead. At first I thought it was a star and I called it to the attention of my companions as such. Then I noticed that it appeared to be a highly polished metallic object reflecting light. It appeared to be round but I could not determine whether it was flat or spherical. While watching this my eye was attracted by a moving circular object of approximately the same size and altitude. It did not appear as bright as the first object. It appeared to be moving at a approximately the same speed of a jet plane but I noticed it was constantly accelerating and continued to accelerate as it moved off toward the South. The most striking thing was that it appeared to be accelerating until it disappeared at an angle of approx. 30* above the horizon. As for an estimation of speed I would say it was going 3 times as fast as a jet plane when it disappeared. This took place at 0430 hours. Two or three minutes before it disappeared it left a trail similar to a jet plane when it breaks the sound barrier. The object did not appear to be an airplane because of its acceleration and speed. I also noticed that it left no vapor trail which I believe was due to the fact that it was above the jet planes and the water vapor in the atmosphere.

STATEMENT OF: Donald R. Hartlauer

I was inside our assigned radar van listening to the comments of some of the other students who were watching a glowing object in the sky. Benn Bush comments that he could see a star shining over his hand. This aroused my curiosity to go out and see it. As we watched this gleaming object, we perceived a slight southeasterly movement of it. I took my eyes off it for a moment and looked again as Bush said that it's taking off. It was no longer where I had previously seen it and I was unable to pick it up again visually as Bush traced it's rapid path southward to the horizon.

Approximately 13 minutes later we estimated the time that we'd first seen the object to be 8:40 by my watch.

I continued watching the sky for other objects and it was at 9:07.5 that I spotted another identical-looking object moving swiftly from the time I'd first spotted it to the South. This one was perhaps a little lower than the first. I traced it from overhead nearly to the horizon created by a semi-building, with a rolled-up sheet of paper to the horizon due east before it vanished. It was indistinct able to my eyes.

Estimation of altitude or speed is too difficult to judge without an idea of the size of the objects.

This second object appeared to wobble very gracefully at the same time it sped forward - similar to a paper plate in a strong wind, though it could extend or diminish its forward movement. The wobbling effect was manifest on the shining surface. It would become darker on one side and then different on the other once in a while.

At 9:15, by my watch, I followed a third similar shining object which followed the same general, or possibly identical path, southward as the first two.

STATEMENT OF: Electo Nadain

At approximately 1907 I saw a white or silver object in the air which appeared to be a round ball which soon disappeared. Then about 30 seconds later I saw the same object. This time it kept its direction and it seemed to gain a little altitude and then it began to travel at a terrifically high speed in the direction of south. It traveled faster than anything I ever saw. It's approximate height or speed I cannot determine because I did not know the size of it. All I know is that it was definitely round and shiny. At whatever height it was, it disappeared faster than any jet that I have seen fly at low altitudes.

STATEMENT OF: Pvt David M. Hall
1 July 1952

From an MRG antenna tower I saw what at first appeared to be a silver ball hanging in space directly above my head. It seemed to be larger than the object that was circling around it. The object hovered there, apparently motionless for about a minute then moved sharply to the right. (south), appearing to revolve, then darted north, too fast for my eye to follow, then just disappeared as if it elevated out of sight.

STATEMENT OF: PVT. ARTHUR M. DAREX
1 July 52
1010

While observing unusual jet vapor trails with other radar students, I heard the radar, "Look at the stars." Tending to believe that he (Pvt. Dusk) could see in the sky during daylight, continuing blue sky), I had Pvt. Dush direct me until I could see the object also, which indeed did closely approximate the luminous qualities of a star.
At first it seemed motionless, but when I placed my head in a fixed position and lined up the object with the top of the radar van, I could detect a slight movement of the object which appeared to be a small area.  I could not determine whether the object was merely one, or perhaps one of several smaller objects. This inability was due to the minuteness of the object (or objects) and its reflective quality.  Suddenly the object moved from its relatively stationary position directly overhead, and moving very rapidly disappeared to the north.
I have had very little experience estimating aircraft speed and altitude.  I can only say that the object moved much more quickly than the jets and I would estimate its altitude to be in excess of two miles.

While searching for targets on our 584 we picked up several moving targets almost directly overhead - Range 10,000 - 15,000 yds and shifting about in azimuth time was about 0930 hrs.

Several minutes later we picked up and tracked a similar target slightly north and east of our location at between 29,000 and 30,000 yds - not moving considerably in A.z. or E.l.

STATEMENT OF G. D. SMITH

UNCLASSIFIED

While working on the MP-8 my crew noticed several planes laying vapor trails or smoke screens. While trying to discern which of the two it was, smoke screens or vapor from engines, one of the fellows said "Look at the stars." So looking directly overhead I saw what appeared to be a large star. By adjusting along a fixed object I determined that it was moving slightly, perhaps to the west or south west. 

As I watched it intently for approximately 5 minutes, it progressed at the same slow rate of speed, then as I watched it seemed to revolve or wobble so that I lost sight completely, still not having moved hardly at all.

I did not witness the object which moved out of sight as rapidly as it was witnessed by me. There must have been the two of them, the same azimuth.

STATEMENT OF: Private Frederic A. Finnegan

On July first 1952, I was working with an AN/APS-1 Radar set, in the Radar Area at Port Monmouth, New Jersey.

At approximately 3:20 A.M. I stepped out of the set (trailer) to go up the tower. As I looked up I saw planes maneuvering overhead, there were no blips on my radar scope to indicate their presence, but they were definitely there, and seemed to be playing around at such an altitude as to almost exceed the reach of the tower. This situation always attract my attention as I was trying to figure out what they were doing. After a moments observation. I resumed climbing the tower. When I reached the tower a friend of mine was already there, looking to the sky, many more down on the ground were beginning to get interested. He as I saw it, then pointed up to the air where I clearly observed a silvery cigarlike object high in the air, which I considered was definitely not a plane. It was slowly moving from right to left, for about 2 or 3 seconds, as I took my eyes off it I lost sight of it, my friend still had his eyes on it, I asked him to point it to me, using the edge of the antenna as a gun sight method, he did, and immediately I saw it. He was then of the opinion, that a peculiar stand-still. I am sure of that fact, because I still was watching it with the antenna, which was also still. After at least one (1) minute, this object started moving, slowly but smoothly, there was no jerk about it, I looked at it amazed, as I couldn't understand how a thing in a stand-still position could start moving, at first I had thought, it might have been a balloon. This motion towards the South, increased to an incredible velocity, I followed it as long as I could, but then lost it in the sky. The trajectory had a very slight curve to it. The sky was very clear, without any clouds.

One of the facts that made me positive this thing was unusual, is that as it started accelerating it path seem to bend at a extremely slight angle, from right to left.

angle that of a plane, which gave the impression that they were flying in
this same direction. I would say that plane was going very fast, but this
object's acceleration was tremendous, it made the plane seem to stand still.
To the best of my ability, I would describe it as being round in
shape, clean looking, and shiny as it stood very high in the sky. There
was no blurred edges about it, or anything in my line of sight.
The two outstanding features of this event were:
1. the swelling motion, and standstill of the object.
2. the acceleration; I fortunately had the presence of the antennae
edge, and the plane to compare it with.
I am also sure it was maneuvering at a higher attitude than that
of the plane.

WD-AGO Form 563
2 July 1952
Preparing Office: AGofs, G2, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey
Subject: Unconventional Aircraft

MEIER stated that these 12 unconventional aircraft displayed great maneuver- ability, excessive high speeds and the same characteristics as the two objects reported earlier on that date.

At approximately 1523 hours on 1 July 1952, Agent de BAUN contacted Mr. MEIER and reported this lates incident. Mr. MEIER questioned the estimated altitude and requested Agent de BAUN to verify the information with Mr. MEIER. He further requested additional details to compare with his earlier reported details.

Agent de BAUN recontacted MEIER and was reassured by him that the estimated altitude of these unconventional aircraft was from 10 to 12 thousand yards. Agent de BAUN then contacted Col. PIPER and was advised by him that the Air Force would immediately investigate the reported presence of these unconventional aircraft in the vicinity of Fort Monmouth.

AGENT'S NOTE: During the period covered by this report, the weather was clear, visibility excellent, with an exceptionally high ceiling with few visible clouds.

Then a second object moving from about due easterly northeast. It was similar in character and granted it out to other observers. Though it. was moving at the rapidity of a jet plane, it was constant in its lighting and changing with a pulsating movement. It faded from sight before long, about 3-5 miles away and altitude approximately 10,000 feet. Weather was perfect, clear, and should continued visibility with a breeze coming out of the east.
The object moved in a straight line well past the horizon.

Transcribing the text:

In the following sketch is seen an attempt to explain the sighting of the object shown herewith, and it is alleged that this is the appearance of the object when first seen and is all that can be seen. Since the apparent width of the object is from 1 to 2 impossible miles, it means that the diameter of the object is 1, 2, or 3 miles along the axis of path to show the successive positions of this object after initial observation of time during the sighting.

To the sketch is please show the characteristic of the object: 

A. Apparent shape - round. 
B. Apparent color - seem? - greyish.
C. Apparent direction of motion - descent. 
D. Apparent altitude of motion - probably very high.

The way and manner are many others a very strange thing in their correct sighting, as this sketch is shown the apparent path of the object.

Text extracted from the document:

6 Aug 1952
there was a sighting of an unidentified object at 1930 hours on 7 Aug 1952. The object was observed by [ILLEGIBLE] of the Ground Observer Corps post and was reported to the U.S. Air Force on the same date.
The unidentified object was first observed approximately west of the post and was moving in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for about 5 minutes and could not be identified as any known type of aircraft. The object was estimated to be approximately the size of a small aircraft and emitted no sound.
There was no photograph taken of the object as the observer was not equipped with a camera.

The series of light sightings to the route of the surrounding area are significant. Several clear observations of the material and clear conditions of the time of their sighting.

Results - very clear
5 sights - more query little
Airfield conditions - none
While watching several jets and their vapor trails, motion that looked like a star at a greater altitude. By watching it for a while it seemed to move back and forth. As I went to the 5-0R 5-5 and told them to try and track the jet. While they were getting them on the r. radar, they watched until they lost it. They went to move they radar and lost the jet. After that they wasn't able to move they had them. Upon having the beam of radiation as the jet. seemed to know they was going to try and track them so he took off at a very high rate of speed.

Transcribing the text in the document:

Have you ever made mental notes of several facts and figures concerning a strange observation you have made or heard about? I have, and I'm sure many others have also.

A strange occurrence was observed here in - several times during the past few months. At first it was only a small white light, appearing and disappearing at irregular intervals. Later it increased in size and luminosity, and took on a distinctive oval shape. It was observed on several occasions, always in the same general area of the sky.

On one particular night the object was observed for several minutes and was seen to change color from white to amber. It moved rapidly to the East, stopped, hovered for a few seconds, then zoomed off to the North at tremendous speed.

Residents - , who observed the object, were amazed and mystified by this strange phenomenon. Some offered the explanation that it might have been a meteor or a shooting star, but the prolonged observation and the unusual maneuvers of the object rule out this possibility.

What do you think it could have been? We would be very interested in your opinion and any comments or explanations you might care to offer.

Sincerely yours,
[ILLEGIBLE]

The text transcribed from the document is as follows:

"This would seem to be an unusual request of an unusual nature. Are there any facts or intelligence available which would indicate that this request should be granted? The report indicates that he has information which he feels may be of considerable value. However, no details are given as to the nature of this information. Do you feel that if this information is actually of value, the only way it can be obtained is by granting the request for reimbursement of expenses? I am somewhat hesitant to recommend granting this request without knowing more details as to the nature of the information which he claims to have. Perhaps it would be advisable to have him submit a more detailed outline of the information he claims to have, and the reasons why he feels it is of value, before making a decision on his request. I would appreciate your views on this matter."

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

19. Lt. Brinkle, a ground observer, came to the station from Westfield, Mass., and reported this:
At about 4:10 a.m. EST he observed two large, bright white lights, one directly above the other, moving very rapidly in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 500-1000 mph. The lights appeared to be at an altitude of 25,000-30,000 feet. After being visible for about 1 1/2-2 minutes, they disappeared from view.
Lt. Brinkle said that they were much larger and brighter than any aircraft lights he had ever seen. In his opinion, they were definitely not conventional aircraft lights.
20. Capt Donovan and 1st Lt. McCarthy of the F-94 squadron located at Mitchel Air Force Base were dispatched to investigate the area, but were unable to sight the objects. They did however, observe a bright, seemingly stationary light which they were unable to identify.
