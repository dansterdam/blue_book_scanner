12. COMMENTS
Received by AF Form 112. The local intelligence office of Nellis AFB was of the opinion that this sighting was generated by a comet. The description of this object appears to be that of a balloon, especially in this time just before dawn. MDR Balloon # 97W was in the east over Nellis at the time of the sighting and the object was seen at 800 azimuth.

Resolved by this headquarters as WAS Balloon
