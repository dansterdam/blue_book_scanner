STATEMENT

At 9:30, 7 August 1952, my mother took my son out into the back yard to see an airplane coming from the West. While watching the plane, she noticed a large, round object in the sky moving at a very fast rate of speed. It came from the West, made a U-turn and disappeared, somewhat like a light being turned out. My mother then turned and saw another in the North heading South moving slowly. As it moved along it seemed to gather speed and disappeared in the same manner as the first. Mother came in and told me about them and we both went out to see them. A third object appeared from the North at about 9:20 and moved slowly South. While watching this object, we noticed a fourth object appear from the North, passed the third object rapidly, made a large circle bearing East and disappeared as it came in line with the sun. A two engined aircraft heading South passed under the 4th object.

The objects appeared to be about 18 inches in diameter, round but flat, and looked like a ball of white fire. All four objects appeared to be similar in size, shape and color.

I certify that the information contained above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SANA

In compliance with AF letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) Objects were round and disc-shaped, appeared to be approximately eighteen inches in diameter (actual size), and were of a color somewhat that had been heated to a white heat. There were four objects (for reference and clarity labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4) and were observed singly with the exception of objects three and four. Objects three and four no formation, however, they were observed in the same approximate vicinity. No aerodynamic features, trail or exhaust, or propulsion system noted. Speed undetermined but observed at a rate at least three times faster than a prop driven aircraft. No sound was heard. Object one made a radical direction change continuing on a collision avoidance path. Object two performed no maneuvers only statight, level flight. Object three appeared from the north and curved circled. Object four vanished much in the same manner that an electric light would disappear when turned out.

(2) Time of sighting 0903 hours, 7 August 1952, Central Standard Time. Length of the observed approximately one hour and ten minutes.

(3) A visual surface observation without optical or electronic equipment was made.

(4) Observer was at her residence [redacted] at the time of the sighting.

(5) Objects observed by [redacted], reliability unknown.

(6) Fair weather prevailed at the time of the sighting.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, is known to have existed at the time which may have accounted for the sighting.
