The first time I saw the bright light was at about eight-o'clock in the morning while making routine visual checks of the area around the field.

Seeing the light I assumed that it might be on aircraft landing light of some plane nearing the Ontario Airport located west of Norton Air Base.

I am or fifteen minutes later the Norton dispatch section that the editor of the Sun; & Sun Bernardino newspaper, was on this plane carrying that several persons in the Fontana area, a small community located west of San Bernardino, had reported sighting a very bright light in the vicinity of Fontana. A request was made by the dispatcher that we notify vision in case we saw the light again.

at eight thirty-nine. I saw the bright
light again and notified the dispatcher.

A short while later, I was told that
more personnel had sighted the light
again. This time the light was at about
the same spot as the first and stayed
on for about twenty seconds. The light
I witnessed in military steadily and rapidly
went it went out.

Five minutes later at eight forty-three
I saw the light again in the same
place on the horizon. I picked up the
camera and stopped at the control
Tower cab and was able to get one
picture of the light light before it
went out. This was the last time
I saw the light. I'm setting the picture
shutter speed at one-tenth and the
diaphragm out at three and five
tenths.

The light was more at one of the three
times I now show and I would estimate the
altitude at which I saw them to be about nine
thousand. I believe there were visible around the
height. But some were near or bright as the
three lights.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                                                   3 Nov 1953 (England)

THREE MESSAGES RECEIVED 19 November 1953 REGARDING SIGHTING IN ENGLAND:

1. A British sergeant and four assistants were testing a radar set in a London suburb. Suddenly, an intense signal flashed on the set-far greater than those obtained from ordinary planes. The signal came from an object which seemed circular or spherical and white in color.

The RAF radar men were dealing with a mysterious metallic object about the size of a very large bomber. For fifteen minutes, the strange signal persisted on the radar. Then the object sped off over the English countryside at a height of 60,000 feet.

Two RAF officers flying a jet at 20,000 feet also saw the saucer-shaped phenomenon. They said the huge spheroid was giving off or reflecting a fierce light and passed their plane at tremendous speed.

The British War Office and the Royal Air Force Fighter Command are said to have begun an investigation.

2. The British War Office and Air Ministry confirmed this morning that a "strange object" had been tracked on November 3rd by Army radar. The object - a metallic phenomenon - was sighted by two Royal Air Force officers flying in a jet plane. Even as an investigation was begun, a woman in Essex said she had sighted a "mysterious object" in the night sky on the same day and again five days later.

3. People in England are up in the air over a new "flying saucer" controversy.
The meteorological office in London says a white disc reported by two fliers and
registered over a radar screen in 16 nothing but a weather balloon. Another official
claim the alleged "flying saucer" fits the description of a new aircraft being
built by a foreign power. He declined to name the power.

VIRGINIA FIREBALL OF 1953 NOVEMBER 3
A.A.S. No. 2366
B. S. RAGLAND and C. P. OLIVIER

At this date at about 6:11 p.m., most searching, as far the sub-height, a bright fireball was observed by persons in or near Richmond, Va. The reports were gathered by Redfield S. Ragland who, 6 years later, became our regional director for Virginia, and whose sudden and untimely death in 1961 was a very great loss to the A.A.S. These reports he later turned over to Olivier for a possible solution. The following is the letter comes from all concerned in an area with a radius of 50 miles.

Two observations, with which we are concerned, with the illuminated by intersection of the two lines of sight. The point and height is based on two points and two individual points of 441.872 acres out as only 11° hence two points in a point.

Date ........................ 1953 Nov. 3-6
Sidereal ..................... 3137
Begins over .................. Ae=78°43'; φ=36°49' at 110 km
Ends over ..................... Ae=78°02'; φ=35°42' at 85 km
Projected coordinates .......... h=170 km
Length of path ................. 142 km
Radiant uncorrected ............. a=156°, h=-1°
Radiant corrected ............... a=156°, h=-0°
                                 a=177°, δ=+15°

On this same date at 6:26 p.m. E.S.T., another fine fireball was observed from New Jersey. We have one good observation from D. S. Wood at Palmyra, and two very poor ones from elsewhere. Wood gave the beginning at zenith, path vertical to N.W., and altitude 290°, duration 4 seconds. It was brilliant blue, diameter 1/3 of full Moon, size 10°. A fragment broke off just before disappearance. Though the path of this fireball could not be computed we have enough data to be sure it could have come from the same radiant as the Virginia one 15 minutes earlier.

It may be added, that in our fireball card file, for 1953, we already have 8 fireball records on November 1 to 6 inclusive of which 4 came on Nov. 3 and 4, an unusual number for the shower nights when ... (rest of text is partially illegible). It is certain that we receive reports on only a very small fraction of fireball events.

12. Intelligence Officer's Comment: The sighting lasted only two seconds and then was not worldly verified. On 19 Nov 53 indicated no storms were known to be in the area of the sighting. The winds at the base were light and variable and not of a velocity that would have been carried in the opposite direction of the above sighting.

The weather people at this station are now checking with people from balloons from Bermuda to reach the position of the sighting and much more definite information. The balloons from this station, however, confirm the weather reports indicating and the pilot confirms that there were no thunderstorms or lightning in the area. On the 17th of the same month, the brightness of the object sighted by Capt Coolsby (in his words it seemed an explosion) and the short duration of the sighting (in other words from 9,000' to 1,000') would tend to indicate the object was not a light from a high altitude. The pilot was conversant with the reports of the sighting and is a senior pilot with more than 3,500 hours and was chief pilot for the station for the month of December 1953. The pilot stated he had never observed a similar sighting.

The reporting officer claims no explanation for the reported sighting and in the absence of further information, believes it would be very difficult to determine the nature of the object.
