    and went W                      One (1), round, red object, the size of a 
                                    quarter at arms length, appeared to drop, then 
                                    ascend and head west.

11. COMMENTS
    The observer possibly saw jet aircraft. 
    The fact that the observer is located 
    in a locale of heavy aircraft activity 
    and that the description could fit 
    that of jet exhaust, leads this hq 
    to the above opinion. A check with 
    COC Weather indicates that they were 
    no known balloons in this area at the 
    time of sighting.
