ATIC Comments:
1-4/c noticed in vicinity on radar
2-4/c noticed in vicinity originally - making sharp turn
3- No object seen - only a light
4- Seen for only a fleeting second
5- Astro Charts + computer (M.O. file) show that above 20,000 ft. light from descending sun would be visible

6- KG stay turn would produce just the effect described - a just of flight for this recent - for the sun's slant rays

Concur: Other Reflecting of sun's slant rays 4/4/c surfaces.
