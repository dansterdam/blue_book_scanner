SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for November 24, 1957

Venus Is Christmas Star
A crescent moon and the planet Venus will be close together on December 24, making a brilliant pair that lights the Christmas sky.

By JAMES STOKLEY

This year we will have a real Christmas "sky picture" Venus, which has been making in prominent figure during the autumn.

After the sky picture, around this date, Venus will be blazing in the southwest, until it follows the sun below the horizon more than three hours later. But even this will not be the full extent of the display.

In the 24th, the moon, now crescent just to the north of Venus, will be making daylight hours. This will be striking display that can be well seen through a telescope.

Venus is the only planet that can be well seen after Mercury has set. The planet appears as a bright star-like object in the southwest after sunset. If you look closely, you can see a faint crescent shape of Venus through a telescope.

They say Venus has set about 1900 years ago, after Venus has set. They say in the southwest there is now visible the familiar array of star make the winter evening so beautiful.

Brightest of these stars is Sirius, the dog star, part of Canis Major, the great dog-star constellation. However, in looking closer, a partial display of its light later is in angle to distance lighter in the southern sky and is less more conspicuous.

On the astronomer's scale of star brightness, Sirius is of magnitude minus 14, which means that it exceeds any other star that we can see in the nighttime sky. Canopus, however, is relatively bright, but the magnitude of that planet is minus 14. Venus now is nearly 16 times brighter as Sirius.

Where Sirius, Orion, the sunrise, may be seen in this group are two bright stars of the "first magnitude": Betelgeuse, to the right, and Rigel, a little lower and to the left. Between them is a row of three other stars that form Orion's belt, directly above Orion is Taurus, the bull.

With Aldebaran as the brightest star; distinctly red in hue, it is easy to identify.

To the left of Taurus is Auriga, the charioteer, with the star Capella, another of the first magnitude.

Descending from Capella, we come to Gemini, the twins, with the stars called Castor and Pollux, of which the latter is the brighter. And between Gemini and Canis Major and Canis Minor, the lesser dog, with Procyon as the brightest star.

Over toward the southwest we found the remnants of the constellations of the autumn evening. Near the horizon, as shown on the maps, or higher if it is visible, are the constellations of the first magnitude of Lyra, the lyre. Above and to the left is Cygnus, the swan. With Deneb, while Vega and Deleb both are first magnitude stars, their low altitude makes them look fainter.

About 150 a.m., if the sky is not too cloudy, Venus, the virgin, in the light of Sirius, will be a bright object.

On the astronomer's scale of star brightness, Sirius is of magnitude minus 14, which means that it exceeds any other star that we can see in the nighttime sky.

The article includes two star charts showing the positions of various constellations and stars.

Science News Letter for November 23, 1957

Like the moon, it has no light of its own but is illuminated by the sun, so that one half is bright and the opposite half dark.

Last April 14 it was out beyond the sun, with the entire bright hemisphere turned earthward. Since then it has been moving and is now coming between the earth and sun. Thus, most of its night hemisphere is turned away, and we have a crescent phase.

On Jan. 14 it will be, nearly directly opposite the sun, and will correspond to new moon. After that it will become an evening again, visible in the morning sky before sunrise.

Unlike the moon, Venus is always so far away that only through a telescope are its phases visible.

The phase of Venus differs from those of the moon in two ways. As the moon travels around the earth, its distance changes very gradually, from about 221,000 miles to 251,000 miles. Thus there is no great change in its purest size, and the diameter of the full moon is about the same as when it is in a narrow crescent phase. But when Venus is full its disc will appear about 160,000,000 miles away. Just before Christmas it will be about 40,000,000 miles away, and on Jan. 28 its distance will be about 24,000,000 miles. Then, as it passes near the "new" phase, it is much larger, seemingly in the sky.

That is why it is brightest when it is nearest. Although less than half of the bright side is visible to us, its proximity largely makes up for this. We can see its larger arc of the sky. Then it is at the present brilliance.

Winter Arrives

On Dec. 21 the sun, which has apparently been traveling southward in the sky, reaches its southernmost point. This is the winter solstice, the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

At that moment the sun will be directly over the Tropic of Capricorn.

FIREBALL OF 1957 DECEMBER 5
A.M.S. No. 2368

On this date at 10:09 p.m. E.S.T., a very bright fireball was seen from Philadelphia. A note in the Evening Bulletin was published asking for observations and eventually 20 were received. Long after, some newspaper clippings were sent in showing that the object was seen from several places in

North Carolina and Virginia but with no actual data. The path was not at the time of the 20, 1 of which was from the Philadelphia neighborhood, 2 from New York and one from Delaware. This problem was with that the wording several indicated that it was a hope-a meteor to secure angles from the observers. This clipping gave no names to contact. There is, however, almost unanimity that the path was horizontal. "In if the height of any one point on the path could be well determined, by drawing circles with observer's position as centers, a path could be determined. We fix an approximate sub-beginning point for these 1 observers in or near S15 at 34°N, N.J. and S3 in N.E. Philadelphia at 39°34', the giving a good diagram. The intersection of the last two gives the only chance for determining the path. The beginning point is S19 at Felton, Del., and the end point at Fork Union, Va., gives a diagram which in general cannot be interpreted

but does give a±=203°. This crossing lines from S1 and S3 gives a subendpoint approximately, using an stated our position circles. Finally, it is a matter of judgment. After studying the diagram, exactly where the projected path was, but to satisfy its parallel with the horizon, it could only be shifted parallel to itself, and so the derived radiant would not be affected. The heights H1 and H2 of course would be. This has a disk is stated by 9 observers; a good drawing shows it elliptical in shape. The mean of three actual estimates gives the diameter 0.3 of Moon. Color estimates as usual vary, but the majority give blue-greenish, and the rest were orange-yellow. The object was unusually large and brilliant, but no estimates that can be turned into magnitudes were given. Some observers were indoors, some in cars, so the object must have been very bright. As the zenith of the radiant may have appreciable error, no orbit is calculated. The usual data follow.
