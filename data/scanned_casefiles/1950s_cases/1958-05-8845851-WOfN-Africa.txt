THE HOLLY RIVER SAUCER

HANK MOLLAHAN: We couldn't tell too much. You see we were at the foot of the hill and he was clear on top, you might say, and we couldn't tell much what he was doing.

BARKER: I had heard reports from other people who had talked with you that you had seen two little men about three feet tall...

HANK MOLLAHAN: (Interrupting): No, we didn't see nothing like that.

BARKER: They must have exaggerated that. You saw a man and you were so far away that naturally he looked small. You wouldn't have any idea of just how tall he might have been?

HANK MOLLAHAN: No.

BARKER: You saw some movement where it landed. Could you see the object itself?

HANK MOLLAHAN: We actually couldn't make out the object. We thought we saw it a time or two.

BARKER: At the time you saw movement, was it still daylight?

HANK MOLLAHAN: It was about 4:30 or 5:00 in the evening. It was pretty dusky then.

BARKER: When you saw this thing land, what was your impression that it was?

HANK MOLLAHAN: I thought it was something from the United States, maybe, Army or Navy. There are so many experimental things.

BARKER: I understand that you called the police.

HANK MOLLAHAN: No, we didn't call them. We started to call them and decided if we did call them and there wasn't anything to it, people would think we were crazy. Then we got to thinking about it and we just drove to Sutton and they weren't there so we went to Gassaway and found this State Policeman sitting there in the road.

BARKER: What was his name in case I want to get in touch with him?

HANK MOLLAHAN: I really don't know.

HERMAN BARKER: Trooper Cooke.

HANK MOLLAHAN: There was another man with him who called him Rodney.

BARKER: Rodney Belknap. I talked with him last night. I asked him, "What do you think of these people? Are they truthful?" And he said, yes, he was sure that it wasn't someone just making up something. And he said that you acted rather frightened. Were you?

HANK MOLLAHAN: Well, I wasn't exactly brave. He wanted us to go up on top of the mountain with them that night, and we told them we wouldn't do it. We would go the next day, but we wouldn't go after night.

BARKER: Did you feel it might be dangerous to go up there?

HANK MOLLAHAN: Why, yeah, we didn't know exactly what we'd run into.

BARKER: Was it after dark when you went for the police?

HANK MOLLAHAN: Oh yes, I suspect it was 7:00 o'clock when we left.

H. G. MOLLAHAN: Yeah, later than that.

HANK MOLLAHAN: It was about 10:00 or 10:30 when the police got here.

BARKER: Now after it was dark, could you see any lights?

HANK MOLLAHAN: We thought we saw any one light. We weren't absolutely sure. We thought we did.

H. G. MOLLAHAN: Now, let me get a word in here. There were three of them follows up there that had lights, wasn't there?

THE HOLLY RIVER SAUCER

HANK MOLLOHAN: Yes.
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Well, as I understand it, the Knisely woman saw
a red light way down there on the ridge, this side of them.

BARKER: That was when the police were up there?
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Way down on this side of them.

BARKER: And none of you people had a red light.
HANK MOLLOHAN: No, I didn't even see it.

BARKER: Did the police go where you had seen the object?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Yes. You see, we stood on the road, along the river, and when they went up on top of the hill he hollered and tried to direct them to where it was, but he best we could.

BARKER: Did they find any signs?
HANK MOLLOHAN: They said they didn't find any signs at all.

BARKER: When were you up at the site?
HANK MOLLOHAN: We were up the next day.

BARKER: And what did you find?
HANK MOLLOHAN: We couldn't find nothing, except where people had been trampling around, probably the police had done it, or someone else.

BARKER: Are there open places where something that big could land without breaking any branches?
HANK MOLLOHAN: There are places where there isn't maybe grown up places where they could set straight down, like a helicopter. But as far as an airplane landing and taking off, there isn't.

BARKER: What was it your brother saw?
HANK MOLLOHAN: He saw a rod, it just looked like a radar thing, a big rod with a thing on top of it, revolving, going round and round.

BARKER: Was it on top of the object?
HANK MOLLOHAN: It was on the top of the hill, where the object went down.

BARKER: And it was sticking up?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Uh huh.

BARKER: And where was he, when he saw this?
HANK MOLLOHAN: He was in the road, over there what they call the Old Taylor bottom.

BARKER: And you weren't with him at that time?
HANK MOLLOHAN: I was with him, but he was looking through the glasses. You see, we just had one pair of glasses, I never could locate it.

BARKER: Now, to review, I would like you to tell me the names of everyone who witnessed this thing.
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Well, H. G. Mollohan, Jr., saw it, and his wife saw it; Walter Knisely saw it; and Ora Moats; and myself; and Eddie Mollahan and his wife saw it.

HANK MOLLOHAN: There was a man on what they call Gibson Ridge saw it the same day, too.

BARKER: What was his name?
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Cougar or Gibson, I swear I can't remember which.

HANK MOLLOHAN: Out on Gibson Ridge. You know where Gibson Ridge is?

BARKER: No I don't know this country well.

HANK MOLLOHAN: It's just north of here, about two miles, as the crow flies. They came over here the next day in a pickup truck to find out what we'd seen, if it was anything like what they had seen.

BARKER: How did they describe what they had seen?

THE HOLLY RIVER SAUCER

HANK MOLLORAN: I was working. I didn't get to talk to them. My wife was telling me about them being here.

BARKER: Did they see anything as close up as you did?
HANK MOLLORAN: I really don't know.

BARKER: Have you ever heard any stories about flying saucers?
HANK MOLLORAN: I've heard quite a few of them.
BARKER: What do you think about these stories?
HANK MOLLORAN: Well, I think there's something to it. I think they see something.

BARKER: Do you think that what you saw was from space?
HANK MOLLORAN: No I don't think it was from space.
BARKER: What makes you think it wasn't?

HANK MOLLORAN: Well, the main reason was the fuel. The way the fuel was burning and everything they'd have to have an awful load of fuel to carry as big a ship as that was and bring it any distance.

BARKER: I believe it was your impression that perhaps this was some kind of experimental thing of the Army or Navy had. You know if the State Police from this area reported it, and Ed told him just what was said and what happened. Told him he just doubted it.

He was pretty well tore up over how the law acted about it.
BARKER: Tell me this, did the law seem to disbelieve...?
H. G. MOLLORAN: Well, you know I wasn't with them while they were here. Just the two boys were here. They just plainly told them they weren't going up in them woods after dark. In fact the deputy sheriff told them that he didn't see any sense in going up there after night, but the state police wouldn't listen to him.

BARKER: They went right on up there then?
H. G. MOLLORAN: They went right on up—three of them.
BARKER: Well, when you saw something like that land, it might be just a bit difficult to tell yourself to go up on a dark mountain and investigate. Just one more thing I forgot to ask: What was the color of the object?

HANK MOLLORAN: It was more of an aluminum color—about the same color of the sky. If it hadn't been for the dark cloud, I doubt if we'd have ever seen it.
BARKER: Did it seem to glow?
HANK MOLLORAN: No, only when the sun glinted on it.
BARKER: Did it appear metallic?
HANK MOLLORAN: Yes.

BARKER: Well, thank you gentlemen very much for an interesting account. This will go into my records as another case of people who have seen the so-called unidentified flying objects. We don't know quite what they are, but perhaps one of these days we shall. Thank you very much.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

astronomical research has developed—radio
astronomy.

The sun, the moon and many other objects in the universe are sending us radio waves. Many radio telescopes, have been built to pick up these waves, and provide data for study and investigation.

If a piece of iron is heated to approximately 3,000 degrees, it shows a dull red glow; at 3,000 degrees, it shows a brilliant white glow. These waves of visible light range from the circumference of 1/40,000 inch, which gives approximately 170,000 to 1 inch, longer than red are the infrared, given off by objects much more slowly. The longer waves in the infrared region, are given off by objects that are relatively cool, even a temperature more than those of our normal surroundings.

Jupiter's Lightning

Such in radio region an inch or so in length, have been detected from the moon. Venus, and Jupiter. The temperatures in the region of zero to 32 degrees Fahrenheit are very cold, and no radiation of this sort has been detected from other planets.

Nevertheless in 1935 scientists in Washington did pick up waves from Jupiter. Unlike those due to the bursts, and were visible in radio telescopes, and were also much stronger. Each static burst we sometimes hear on our radio may be a lightning flash on earth.

On the whole, the bursts of static from Jupiter is that there, too, lightning exists. Some of the clouds of ammonia in the planet's skies are the source of such a Jovian stroke as the average stroke on earth.

Venus, also, has been found to broadcast some weak similar signals, but these are much weaker and of a small fraction of a second. As these waves and others, now being built, we will doubtless learn more about the nature of the planets, as well as other celestial bodies.

EPHEMERIS FOR SOVIET EARTH SATELLITE #3
(1958 Delta)

This ephemeris was compiled on 15 May 1958 based upon very early orbit data* and Orbits #1 through #52 were computed based upon an orbit time of 106 minutes.

Thus the equatorial crossing charts for these orbits were drawn with an orbit to orbit shift to the left of 26°. Obviously the orbit to orbit shift will be augmented by the effect of the earth's oblateness against the argument of the equatorial crossing angle. The Equatorial Crossing Graphs for Orbits #53 and greater are corrected for this rotation of the Orbital Plane. This rotation of the orbital plane due to an equatorial crossing angle of 65° is 14' 56". Thus, for more accurate plotting, the Orbits #1 through #52 should be moved to the left (on the Equatorial Crossing Graphs for 15 through 18 May) by 0.249N degrees where N is the number of the orbit.

The refinements afforded by later orbit sightings showed that a constant 180 seconds of time should be subtracted from the equatorial crossing times of the graphs for Orbits #1 through #52. Equatorial Crossing Graphs of succeeding orbits are corrected.

The perigee of the Satellite, in the absence of specific tracking data, assumed to have coincided with the point of orbital injection. Using an equatorial crossing angle of 65° it is computed that the perigee, regardless of its original location, will shift in the orbital plane at the rate of 0.43° per day and this shift will be in a direction opposite to the motion of the Satellite.

* This ephemeris was prepared in order to furnish a guide for radio (20,005 mc satellite transmission) monitoring and is not intended to have the accuracy necessary for optical sighting work.

Remarks:
Of the various possibilities which are suggested by the subject sighting, it is considered that the least likely is Soviet aircraft or missile activity. Somewhat more likely, and consistent with the observation and the area involved, would be a carrier aircraft torching: Based on the scant information given, it is doubtful that a correct evaluation of the report can be made.

5 May, 1958
Montevideo, Uruguay

A BRIGHT SILVERY UFO hovering over Uruguay on May 5, 1958 created such an intense heat in the cabin of a plane that the pilot was forced to open the windows and doors and remove his jacket. The pilot was Carlos Alejo Rodriguez, flying his Fiper aircraft from San Carlos to Montevideo, away the brilliant object approached on an Eastern course and then stop and wobble slightly. He flew to within 800 yards to see the object appearing "top shaped" object both its top and bottom symmetrical. The object then took off at fantastic speed toward the sea.

1958 Encounter With UFO

On May 8, 1958 two sisters driving on U.S. Route 19 at the Tarpon Springs Road in Florida had a very peculiar experience. Miss Hazel Alverson and her sister Mrs. Esther Freeman were driving back to St. Petersburg from Brooksville.

At about 6:30 p.m., both women felt pain in their faces and experienced considerable eyestrain. The source of their trouble apparently was an object in the western sky, approximately in line with the sun. Miss Alverson, an amateur photographer, checked the light intensity of the object, which showed a reading of 1800, as compared with the sun's reading of 200. She took a photograph of the object, which showed a lighted area, but was too faint in the newest to reproduce.

Far-Ranging
Radar Spots
Sputnik III
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 16-
(UP) - Probing American long-
range radar picked up Sputnik
III and the booster rocket which
propelled it today.

The two Russian-made space
invaders, scheduled to pass over
the United States tonight, were
tracked by equipment at the Air
Force's Millstone Hill Installation
at Westford, Mass.

Experimental high power radar
picked up the larger of the two
objects, apparently the booster
rocket, at 10:41.30 a.m. The Air
Force said the object was some
85 miles from Westford over the
western Atlantic.

The radar followed the path of
the booster for six minutes in a
northeasterly direction. The object disappeared over the horizon
beyond Newfoundland at 10:50.15
a.m. toward Iceland.

The second and smaller object,
presumably Sputnik III itself, was
picked up by Millstone radar at
10:53.39 a.m. At the time it was
in the sky northeastward beyond
Newfoundland and 1,047 miles
from Westford and following the
orbit of the bigger object.

Millstone detected radio signals
from the satellite transmitter at
the same time as the sighting of
the smaller object.

Reports of optical sightings,
meanwhile, were co-ordinated at
Smithsonian astrophysical observatory in Cambridge, headquarters
for operation moonwatch teams
around the world.

Smithsonian said that, weather
permitting, Americans should get
two chances to view Sputnik III
and the booster tonight. However,
several sites were expected to
have a big man-made moon
on its first pass. Just after dusk,
in its first pass over New
Hampshire, Vermont, New
Hampshire, Massachusetts and
Connecticut from about 6 to 6:04
p.m.

...The town of Biggleswade, England, was subjected to a series of saucer hoaxes over a period of months by a mechanic who finally confessed his stunt voluntarily. The hoaxer, named Frank Russell, built a contraption consisting of lights, a balloon, and fireworks, which when released at night gave the appearance of a flying saucer for several seconds. He would then retrieve his device and use it again when the spirit moved him. British authorities are undecided as to whether to prosecute or not.

BIGGLESWADE, ENGLAND (UPI)--FRANK RUSSELL GROUNDED HIS "FLYING SAUCER" TODAY BECAUSE HE GOT TIRED OF LYING TO HIS WIFE.

RUSSELL, A MACHINE TOOL OPERATOR, HAD BIGGLESWADE IN A TIZZY FOR SIX MONTHS WITH HIS HOME-MADE SAUCER. NOT EVEN HIS WIFE KNEW ABOUT IT, AND THAT WAS THE RUB.

"THE EXCUSES I HAD TO THINK UP TO TELL MY WIFE WHEN I WANTED TO FLY, IT MADE ME BLUSH," HE SAID. "I HAD TO TELL MY WIFE A LOT OF WHITE LIES SO I COULD WORK ON THE SAUCER."

THE SAUCER WAS A CONE-SHAPED CONTRAPTION FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER. IT HAD FLASHLIGHT BULBS FOR "WINDOWS" AND HAD A ROD ATTACHMENT TO SUPPLY A ROTATING EFFECT.

RUSSELL SAID HE WOULD SNEAK OUT AND SEND THE GADGET UP ON A NYLON LINE WITH A METEOROLOGICAL BALLOON INSIDE IT FOR LIFTING POWER. HE WOULD LET THE SAUCER, LIGHTS ABLAZE, REMAIN IN THE AIR FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. THEN A TIMING MECHANISM PUT OUT THE LIGHTS AND SHOT A FIREWORKS ROCKET INTO THE SKY.

"TO ONLOOKERS, IT APPEARED THAT THE SAUCER HAD SUDDENLY VEERED OFF INTO SPACE." THEN RUSSELL WOULD REEL IT IN AND GO HOME AND LAUGH AND LAUGH.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for April 26, 1958

Saturn Joins Jupiter
UNIVERSE

In May, Jupiter and Saturn will be visible in the evening
sky, and Mars, Venus and Mercury in the early morning sky.
The year's only eclipse of the moon occurs May 3.

By JAMES STOKLEY
JUPITER, NOW shining brilliantly in
the southern evening sky, is joined by
Saturn, the planet with the rings. As soon
as it is dark, if you look toward the south,
you will see Jupiter in the constellation of
Virgo, the virgin. It is just above Spica,
although it exceeds the star in brightness
about 18 times.
Saturn is farther east, in Ophiuchus, the
serpent-bearer, and a little to the left of
Antares, the bright, reddish star in Scorpius,
the scorpion. The planet is about half again
as bright as the star.

The accompanying maps show the appearance of the skies at about 10 p.m., your own
kind of standard time (add one hour for
daylight saving time) at the first of May,
an hour earlier at the middle of the month
and two hours earlier at the end. The stars
are the background against which the man-
made earth satellites can be seen as they
flash brightly across the heavens.
Jupiter is shown on the map of the southern sky, but Saturn does not quite make it.
Part of Ophiuchus is shown along with
Antares, but Saturn is below the horizon.
At the beginning of May it rises about three
and one-half hours after sunset. By the end
of the month it appears only about an hour
after the sun has gone down, before twilight
has faded, in fact.

Arcturus Conspicuous Star
About the most conspicuous star to be
seen on May evenings is Arcturus in Bootes,
the bear-driver, which is just about the
eastern end of Virgo. Another bright star
is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre, which is to the
northeast. Just below this group is Cygnus,
the swan, with Deneb. Although this star
is classed in the first magnitude, it appears
a good deal fainter. It is so low in the
sky that its light is absorbed by the greater
thickness of air through which it has to
pass.

Antares, in Scorpius, also appears fainter
than it should, for the same reason.
To the right of Virgo, and now in its best
position of the year, stands Leo, the lion.
This really is in two parts. To the right is
a group of stars, not an official constellation,
called the "sickle," because of its shape.
Regulus, another star of the first magnitude,
is at the end of the handle, which points
downward. As pictured on the old star
maps, the blade of the sickle formed the
lion's head, Regulus was in his right shoulder, and the star west of Regulus was in his
right paw.
To the left is the triangle of stars which
marked by Denebola. Although this star

Even along the Pacific Coast, not a great
deal will be visible for this is a rather small
partial eclipse.
Both earth and moon are illuminated by
the sun, and cast shadows behind them.
When the moon passes between the earth
and sun, and the lunar shadow falls on this
planet, there is an eclipse of the sun. Such
an event occurred recently, on April 19, but
was visible mainly in Asia. When the moon
enters the shadow of the earth, and its light
is cut off, there is a lunar eclipse and this is
what happens on May 3.
When the moon goes all the way into the
terrestrial shadow, the eclipse is total, but
this time only the edge of the lunar disc
does so. The shadow will cover, at most,
only about one and one-half percent of the
moon's diameter.
Along the Pacific Coast, the shadow will
reach the southern edge of the moon's disc
at 3:00 a.m., PST (7:00 a.m., EST) and
will leave it at 4:26 a.m. During this period
the lower left-hand part of the disc will look
a little darker than normal.
But even though only a small part of the
country will be able to see the eclipse, we
can all see the planet Jupiter which is shining so brilliantly in the southern sky. And
when you look at Jupiter you are looking at
a powerful radio station.

Celestial Radio Station
In recent years, particularly since the end
of World War II, an important branch of

Flying Saucers May 1957

The HOLLY RIVER SIGHTING

By
Hank Mollohan
as told to
GRAY BARKER

Illustrated by
Gene Duplantier

Editor's Note: While frantically trying to keep up with the reports coming in on the November flap, Eastern Editor Gray Barker found that one of the most dramatic reports had fallen practically in his lap. Driving over almost unegotiable roads to reach an isolated farming section near his own country home at Sutton, W. Va., Barker made a tape recording of the actual conversation of the witnesses for Radio Station WCHS, Charleston, W. Va.

Although the grammar used by the witnesses is none too good, and Barker's part of the conversation doesn't read like his carefully edited copy submitted for his regular department, we feel the tape is so honest and convincing that we're taking the space to print it verbatim, without editing.

The hill where Hank Mollahan saw his U.F.O. (as a work of art)

BARKER: I'm at Holly, W. Va., in Braxton County, rather out in the country. I've driven up here today in my brother's truck over these rough roads to talk to some people who saw an unusual flying object here on November 8. First I want the names of the people who were involved. Could you give us your name, sir?

HANK MOLLAHAN: Hank Mollahan, Jr.

BARKER: And you're one of the people who saw the object, and I believe this is your father, isn't it?

H. G. MOLLAHAN: That's right—

BARKER: Now, in addition to you people who were witnesses, there was your brother, Edward Mollahan, am I correct?

HANK MOLLAHAN: That's right. Also his wife.

BARKER: We met them as we were coming into the house, but they were in a hurry to go and meet someone, so I couldn't talk to them. I believe there's someone else around who went outside—one of the boys here, who saw it also. Now to get into this, maybe you can tell me now, as you did outside, when you were working on the truck, just what happened?

HANK MOLLAHAN: It was about 1:30 in the afternoon. We started hunting, and I happened to look up on top of this mountain and saw this object. It looked to be about 40 feet long, more or less in the shape of a hot dog bun. It had port-holes around each side—I'd say half a dozen on each side. And there was fire coming out of these portholes. It would swing kinda like it was trying to get in under the timber, then it would back up. At times I could see both sides of it.

BARKER: Did it appear to be cigar shaped?

HANK MOLLAHAN: That's right, similar to a cigar.

BARKER: Most people, when they see this particular type (and I know of them have been seen) usually call them "flying cigars." You saw the thing manoeuvring on the hill.

Now, Mr. Mollahan, Sr., would you tell us how it moved about?

H. G. MOLLAHAN: When my son called me—there was a whole

Well, that, of course, would be a mile, wouldn't it?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Yes, that would be it.

BARKER: When you saw it disappear. At that time did you think it had fallen, or landed.
HANK MOLLOHAN: We thought it had fallen, or landed.
BARKER: This was still during the daytime when it landed?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Yes.
BARKER: Could you see anything after it landed?
HANK MOLLOHAN: We could see movement, and it looked like there were people working around it. It was getting dark then, and the shade was coming over it and we couldn't see very good.
BARKER: You could see through the trees?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Oh yes.
BARKER: That's when you went up on the other hill to look.
HANK MOLLOHAN: That's right.
BARKER: We definitely saw a man. Whether he was from this or was a hunter, we don't know what it was.
HANK MOLLOHAN: Where was the man?
BARKER: Right under the top of the hill—light near the place where we saw it.
HANK MOLLOHAN: Right under the top of the hill—right near the place where we saw it.
BARKER: Did this look like an ordinary man?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Well, I'd say he wasn't any great big man, just an ordinary man.
BARKER: He didn't seem to be dressed oddly?
HANK MOLLOHAN: No.
BARKER: What did he seem to be doing?
