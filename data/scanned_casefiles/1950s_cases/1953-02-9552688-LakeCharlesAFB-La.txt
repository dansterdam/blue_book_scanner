An unidentified object was observed by ten (10) crew members of the 52nd Bombardment Squadron, 68th Bombardment Wing, on 12 February 1953.

(1) Ten (10) crew members of the 52nd Bombardment Squadron, observed a single unidentified flying object, delta shaped, and approximately fifteen (15) feet in diameter, blush white color. Trail appeared in pulsed-jet fashion, with pulses being much smaller than the object. The object resembled a flaming rag thrown into the air. The pulses extended to the rear four (4) times the length of the object. The object evidently diametrically twenty (20) miles from the observers. Its brightness was greater than the star Sirius and had a steady brilliance. There was no never or loss of altitude in its 90 degree azimuth.

(2) The observation was made visually fr m the ground at 0600 hours Central Standard Time and persisted for twelve (12) seconds when it suddenly disappeared.

(3) The observation was made during the preflight of a B-29 aircraft about two hundred (200) yards north of Hangar 3, Lake Charles AFB La. (4) The object appeared to be at an elevated altitude of five thousand (5,000) feet and traveling at fifteen hundred (1,500) miles per hour. (5) The observers are considered reliable. (6) Weather in area CAVU, winds aloft 310° at 35 knots, 5000 feet. (7) There was no meteorological activity. (8) No physical evidence or photos were obtainable. (9) No interception or identification action was feasible. (10)

There was no traffic in the area at the time of observation.

Lake Charles AFB                                                      12 February 1953

I.   Description of Incident

A bluish-white object with a tail was observed by six Air Force personnel in a combined air-visual and ground-visual sighting. Time of sighting was for a very short period, a matter of seconds. The air crew involved estimated that the breaking object was on a level with them and 20 miles distant. The object was compared to "a flaming rag thrown in the air". There was no sound whatsoever.

II.  Discussion of Incident

Weather conditions at the time of sighting (0600 CST) were CAVU and facilitated easy spotting of meteors. This sighting was undoubtedly caused by the passage of a meteor or "fireball" through the earth's atmosphere which had unusual coloring.

III. Conclusion

Probably astronomical.
