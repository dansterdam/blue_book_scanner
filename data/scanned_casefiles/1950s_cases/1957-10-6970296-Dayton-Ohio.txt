Here is the OCR text from the document:

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

> THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the southwestern sky these evening as dark as not an airplane, a flying saucer, or some bright light hung in the sky as part of an experiment.

What you see is the planet Venus, now reaching its greatest prominence, which comes next to the time in daylight from sunset to sunrise.

Venus is far brighter than any other star or planet seen in the night sky and there is no difficulty in identifying it. Indeed, it can be observed long before the sky is dark, even as the sun is still bright, and even if it is broad daylight!

After it passed behind the sun last April 14, Venus has gradually been drawing to the east of the sun toward the west, followed the sun in its daily motion across the sky, and so remained visible in the west after the sun has set. It will continue to be farther east of the sun, hence remaining in the sky long after the sun goes down.

These maps do, however, show the stars that are now visible.

Toward the west in Deneb, at the top of the "northern cross," which is really part of the constellation Cygnus, is the first-magnitude star Deneb is in the bird's tail; in fact, the word is Arabic and means "tail." The cross represents the wings, and the lower part of the cross has long neck, extended forward in flight. At the end is Albireo, a star of the second magnitude.

In the lower left of the map, the first-magnitude star, Vega, in Lyra, the bright star in the eastern sky, with the star Altair, which is in the south with the four stars that form the great square of Pegasus.

The constellation of Pegasus, the winged horse, is now high in the sky. Among the brightest, their characteristic arrangement makes them a good starting place for those who want to find other groups. The head is actually, in upside down in the sky, so the lower right corner of the square is its head!

The star in the upper right, Alpheratz, is the brightest star in the constellation of Andromeda.

Turning now toward the east, we can see what is generally considered to be the finest constellation in the sky marking its debut for the season.

This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized because of the three stars in a row that form his belt. To the left in Betel, the bright star of the first magnitude, although being so low in the sky do not appear as bright as they might.

November is the month bringing one of the year's famous showers of meteors, or "shooting stars," which appear from about the 13th to the 16th.

They are most numerous after midnight, because then we are on the forward side of the earth in its annual movement around the sun. Thus, we meet them head-on when we are on the rearward part, and see only those that catch up to us.

The object seemed to bob rapidly from side to side and also up and down. It appeared to be very high, 35,000 - 40,000 ft. Seemed to have a red glow in color. 3 others saw this and thought it should be reported. It looked like it could have been over the field when first seen, and moved to overhead.
