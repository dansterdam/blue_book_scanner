INCIDENT NO. 7-50 (February 16, 1953) 11:50 p.m., a
pilot and an instructor in a C47 over Tanagin Area-3 near Anchorage, Alaska-saw a red light that they judged to be an aircraft, five miles away. But as they watched it, it got brighter and brighter, as if heated toward them. Unable to see any green navigation light, they asked the tower at Elmendorf AFB if any other craft were in the area. The tower said there was none, and then made a radar check with negative results. The object was now, and then made a radar check with negative results. The C47 was flying at 2100 feet. The object remained in the C47, an orange or brilliant oval of one mile in diameter, in close observation for 15 minutes. Then it seemed to accelerate and disappear. Supplied for news analysis.

Following is an account derived from an interview with Major Joseph H. Lemon, 
AO 813 531:

At approximately 2350 (AST) 16 Feb 1953 a C-47, AF 1042, piloted by Major 
Joseph H. Lemon, AO 313 531, and carrying Captain Eugene S. Cramer, AO 816 247, 
as instructor-pilot, was east of Fire Island and South of Anchorage over the mouth 
of Turnagain Arm, (SBGF Position Slip). Flying on an approximate heading of 
northwest, at that time an object, described as a round red light approximately 
the size of a wing navigation light of an aircraft approximately five miles distant, 
was observed at a constant position from the C-47. The C-47 was flying at 2000 
feet and the light was estimated to be at 1000 feet. The light was below the 
horizon at this point. The object was estimated to be west of Fire Island and pro-
ceeding on the same course as the C-47 at the similar speed of a jet, estimated 
to be 350 knots. When it was realized that the red light, which is normally on the 
left wing of an aircraft, was apparently on the right wing, Captain Cramer contacted 
by radio, the Elmendorf tower and the nearest radar station in an effort to identify 
the object as a jet aircraft. Both the tower and the radar station reported no 
jets airborne and the radar station was unable to pick up a flying object in the area.

The object continued on a straight course for the Willow area, slowly climbing 
to approximately 2000 feet and increasing to twice its original size and intensity. 
On reaching the above point the object seemed to stop and hang suspended in mid-air, 
maintaining that suspended position for approximately five minutes. It was above the 
horizon at that point.

The C-47 approached Elmendorf and entered the traffic pattern at 1500 feet on 
the upwind leg for runway 150, continued on traffic pattern onto the 
final approach then broke traffic and climbed out again in order to more closely 
observe the object. After th, C-47 had taken up a heading of 330° magnetic the 
object was directly ahead of it. As this time the light appeared to continue on a 
northerly course and, gradually diminishing in size and intensity, disappeared. 
The C-47 circled the area north of Elmendorf for several minutes but no further 
sightings were made. After the object had disappeared a C-124, arriving at Elmendorf 
from Ladd AFB was observed by the C-47 pilots at approximately the same point at 
which the object disappeared.

The duration of the sighting was approximately 15 minutes under CATU weather 
conditions. Aurora Borealis illuminated the sky behind the object. The only 
description of the object was that it was a round, red light, resembling the 
running lights of an aircraft. However, the shape was not clearly ascertainable 
by the observers.

CG 10th Air Division (Defense)                10AD-3-53

Following is an account derived from an interview with Captain Eugene S. Cramer, AO 316 247:

On 16 Feb 1953, at approximately 2345 hours (AST), a C-47, AF 1042, piloted by Major Joseph H. Lemon, AO 313 531, and carrying as instructor-pilot Captain Eugene S. Cramer, AO 316 247, was proceeding on an approach heading of 010 degrees magnetic Cramer, AO 316 247, was at this time, when in a position approximately ten (10) miles east of Fire Island over Turnagain Arm (GEORGE Position Black 5510)

and approaching at a speed of 120 knots, Captain Cramer observed a light, which at a ten o'clock position to the C-47. As this time the light appeared to be stationary and was altering in color from red to blue-green. Believing it to be a celestial body or an aircraft at some distance, Captain Cramer did not mention his observation to Major Lemon until they had proceeded approximately ten miles further on their course. At this time the light began to move in a southwesterly direction, and Captain Cramer estimated its speed and altitude as being approximately 350 knots per hour at 1000 feet and its original position as being in the vicinity between Big Lake and Willow. Inasmuch as the light now appeared as a constant red color and was about the size of a running light of an aircraft, when seen from this estimated distance, Captain Cramer then believed it to be a jet aircraft. However, as they continued on course, the object reversed its flight in the vicinity of GEORGE Position BLAB 3030 and returned at approximately the same speed and altitude to its original position. This maneuver was accomplished at least once and possibly twice.

Due to the fact that the light remained red when traveling northeast in approximately the same direction as the C-47 rather than appearing green as would the running light of an aircraft, Captain Cramer contacted the Elmendorf tower as to whether any jets were airborne in the vicinity or whether the tower had also sighted the object. The tower answered in the negative to both questions. After reviewing jet intercept of the object and being advised that no aircraft were available for the mission, Captain Cramer and Major Lemon received permission to fly a course toward the object, which then appeared to be over Wasilla. Taking up a heading of 345 degrees magnetic and a speed of 150 knots, they broke out of the traffic pattern and cleared toward the object. As they continued over Knik Arm on the course, the light seemed to be about three times its original size and brilliance until it seemed to be about three times its original proportion and appeared to be the reddish orange color of molten iron. At a GEORGE Position Black 1530, at about 0005 hours, 17 Feb 1953, the object began to move again, this time on a heading of between 270 and 290 degrees magnetic at an estimated altitude of 2500 feet, and at an unknown speed. It gradually assumed a bright red color and began to diminish in size until it disappeared about 45 seconds later.

After circling for several minutes and making no more observations of the object, the C-47 returned to Elmendorf Air Force Base and landed.

From the time the light was first observed until it began to increase in size or brilliance the light appeared to have the half-oval shape characteristic of obstruction lights. As it grew in size or brilliance it assumed a complete oval shape. No sound was heard nor were any smoke or vapor trails observed.

The duration of the sighting was approximately fifteen (15) minutes under NAVY conditions. At no time did the observer lose sight of the light.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

It is believed that the sources of this information are very reliable. Both officers appeared to be stable and intelligent; and both should be well qualified, from a number of years flying experience, to accurately observe and record their observations. Neither had any preconceived opinions concerning unidentified flying objects, and seemed to be completely objective in relating their observations.

All possibilities as to the source of this light have been examined with no identification being made. Apparent discrepancies between the statements of the two officers may be attributed to the fact that the light was initially observed by Major Lemon approximately five minutes after being first sighted by Captain Cramer, and that the officers were engaged in bringing their aircraft into Elmendorf for a landing at the time.
