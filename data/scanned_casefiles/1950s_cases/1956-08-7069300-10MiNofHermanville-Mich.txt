The rest of the text is too illegible to read clearly. The document contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram with some numerical annotations, but the specific details are not clear enough to transcribe with confidence.


- page 2 -

Most of the text on this page is obscured by black redaction marks. The only legible text I can see is a partial line that appears to read:

"~ was from Mich. City, Ind"

At the bottom right of the page, there is some handwritten text that appears to say:

"Analytical Det."

The rest of the document is not clearly readable due to the heavy redaction.
