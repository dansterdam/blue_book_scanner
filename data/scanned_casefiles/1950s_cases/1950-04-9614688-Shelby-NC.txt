'Saucers' Sighted
By Shelby Residents

Shelby, April 10.—(JP)—Five Shelby residents aren't "Doubting Thomases" when it comes to tales of flying saucers. They say they saw one Saturday.

Paul Limerick, the commander of Shelby's Veterans of Foreign Wars, gave the report on the "what of the air." He said he and three others, an employee of an auto parts firm, and three children watched it.

Limerick described it as two minutes. It was aluminum colored, not in the shape of an airplane. Apparently round, early course without making any noise or giving out any smoke or flame, he reported. Limerick said a "wobbled" along its course for straight two minutes and then shot upward before disappearing.
