Gieger Camera station reported the first favorable wind moving in the direction of the object to be at 60,000 ft.

Object was observed through 7 x 50 binoculars and appeared in shape of a teardrop, and locked of a translucent color as if we could see through it, and appeared to have an effect attached to it similar to a weather balloon.
