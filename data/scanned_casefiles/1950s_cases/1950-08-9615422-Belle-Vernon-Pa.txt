Dear Sir:

Reference is made to your letter of 4 August 1950 concerning an object which you could not identify.

From the information presented in your letter, it is apparent that the object in question is a pilot balloon target which is carried aloft by a free rising balloon so that it can be tracked by electronic means for the purpose of determining wind speed and direction. This particular balloon target is expendable and unclassified and may be disposed of in any manner which you see fit.

Your forwarding the information in question to this headquarters is appreciated.

Yours truly,

BRYAN L. DAVIS
Colonel, USAF
Air Adjutant General

Dear Sir:

On August 2nd I found a strange lengthy aircraft description of it is an accurate report on August 3rd. I received in magazine about the flying saucer, and your address at the end of the story. I want your advice on what I should do with it. I have not told anyone about it. I am keeping it a secret.

Sincerely,

[The bottom of the letter is redacted/blacked out]
