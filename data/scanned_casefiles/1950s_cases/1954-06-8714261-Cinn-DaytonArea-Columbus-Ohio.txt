60 In Airliner Watch
'Metallic Blob' In Sky

By ROBERT CRATER
Citizen Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON, July 23 — An unidentified object described by an Army colonel as a "metallic blob" was seen by the crew and 60 passengers of a transcontinental airliner over Columbus, O., June 28.

Alerted by radio to investigate the object, the crew circled under it at about 20,000 feet while the passengers took a look at the strange object.

"I had a brief glimpse of it when the plane banked on the turn," and Col. Fred Mowery, 49, an Army doctor stationed here.

"IT WAS ABOUT 7:30 a. m. and the sun was shining. I saw what looked like a metallic blob directly overhead, sort of pear-shaped. I saw the sun reflecting from its surface against the blue sky.

"I didn't see it long enough to determine whether it was moving, or how far above us it was." Many of the passengers thought it was a flying saucer. The crew, after completing the circle under the object, proceeded toward Washington. Col. Mowery said he didn't know who radioed the crew to investigate.

"I DON'T BELIEVE in flying saucers," Col. Mowery said. "I don't know what I saw. It wasn't like any aircraft I have seen."

Capt. Robert White of the Air Force "flying saucer" detail here said he hadn't heard of the report. He said it may have been received at Wright-Patterson Field at Dayton, but that the Air Force would have no comment in any event.

The United Airlines plane was en route from San Francisco to Washington, made only one stop—at Denver.

COL. MOWERY SAID the crew told the passengers they had been asked by radio to investigate the object.

The pilot explained he would make a sweeping circle, banking the plane so that the passengers could look upward and see the object, too." Passengers crowded to the high side windows and peered upward as the plane circled high over Columbus.
