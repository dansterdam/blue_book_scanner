PART TWO MY 172028Z. PARA 11. JAMES D BUNCH, 1/LT., USAF, SENIOR
DIR CC (REW) REMARKS: THIS OBSERVANCE OF A TRACK ON RADAR COULD BE
CREDITED TO INTERNAL INTERFERENCE, HOWEVER, AT THE TIME OF THE
SIGHTING, THE RADAR PAINT PENS INFORMED THE TRACK SPEED WAS NO INTERNAL
INTERFERENCE ON OUR RADAR EQUIP. ALTHOUGH THE SPEED OF THE TRACK
(KG81KG) WAS ESTIMATED AT 3002 KNOTS, THE CALCULATED SPEED TAKEN
FROM THE ENTIRE TRACK PATH INDICATED THE TRACK SPEED TO BE 1415
KNOTS. WE BELIEVE THIS TRACK COULD POSSIBLE HAVE BEEN A TEST ACFT
FROM MUROC OR EDWARDS AFB. EDWARDS AFB, HOWEVER, COULD NOT CONFIRM
THIS TRACK WITH ANY OF THEIR ACFT. OBJECT APPEARED TO BE USING RADIO
AIDS: BLYTHE, THERMAL, DAGGET, AND POSSIBLE INYOKERN RADIOS. OBJECT
DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN INTERFERENCE INCURRED
AT THIS STA. PARA 12 NONE
