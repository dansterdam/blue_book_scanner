XII. Remarks (Any additional or miscellaneous information not completely covered by the above)
I was flying through Gudron Pass when I first saw two lights ahead. These two lights were amber and although they did not look like wing lights, I tried to watch them, assuming them to be two ship formations. I lost them and later saw two more whenever Fontana. These two were joined by two more and these four seemed to be flying a normal course slightly northeast. At no time did I see any normal colored navigational lights. Then more lights joined the first four in a grouping action. This group seemed sometimes to be a breast and sometimes to be just flying in a group as sparrows do.

Although I had no way of telling their speed, they seemed to be moving parallel and slightly toward me at first and then later seemed to be going southwest.

I contacted Long Beach tower in an attempt to have my sighting confirmed, and was informed that there were no known routing or Catalina Island. It is quite possible that if there were a number of them flying, I was looking down their path. But as I said before, I never saw any conventional navigational lights near these lights, and I saw them from Fontana to the time that I entered the hazy level at Long Beach when they appeared to be due south and going away.
