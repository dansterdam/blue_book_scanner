(7) Weather and wind aloft condition at time and place of sighting.
It was reported that there were high cirrus clouds completely covering the sky looking at approximately an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. There was no break in the clouds to be seen except directly overhead. Temperature at ground level was reported as 62 degrees Fahrenheit.

The U. S. Weather Bureau Office at Lockhead Air Terminal, California, reported that on 5 March 1957, the following weather conditions existed: Overcast with clouds 8,000 to 12,000 feet; wind 160 degrees at 23 mph.

This U. S. Weather Bureau Office at Lockhead Air Terminal, California, reported that as of 1920 hours on 23 March 1957, there was a direction of 230 degrees and a speed of 10 mph for the winds at 8,000 to 12,000 feet. No other pertinent weather information is available.

The report relates that viewing the object and telephoning the police department was the extent of any action taken."
