DATE OF INFORMATION

PREPARED BY (Initials)

SOURCE
Control Tower Operators

SUMMARY:

At approximately 2130 on 30 June 1953 a red light appeared sight (a) miles west of Sacramento Tower at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. Three operators on duty, T/Sgt Rudolph D. Rosso, A/2C Ronald W. Hill, and A/2C Arthur E. Gray, Jr., witnessed the eight (8) minute flight. A red light was first sighted in stationary about fifteen (15) minutes.

The Sacramento Tower (CAA) operators called and asked the tower operators 12 they saw the light, which was answered affirmative. The operators observed through field glasses but were unable to see anything other than a red light.

The light appeared round, three (3) feet in diameter, red, stationary, with no other identifying features. It disappeared at 2144 while the operators' heads were turned, therefore, manner of disappearance was unobserved.

The weather was clear with visibility over fifteen (15) miles and a west wind of five (5) knots. Base weather verified no weather balloons reported in this area.

Two aircraft were in area and in contact with the control tower. Aircraft claimed they observed nothing unusual when queried by the control operator.

Videon camera not utilized as training on its use was not complete. Camera now located in the control tower and will be utilized on future sightings.

Reason for tardiness: Written report was originally submitted, in error, through AACS channels on 2 July 1953.

On the night of 31 June 1953, 2100 PST, I was on duty as Senior Controller
in the Yankee Control Room. While busy checking traffic the southeast
controllers on duty with myself called my attention to a red light west of
the towers. The red light appeared to be a light on an aircraft, so I
directed the traffic and went back to my duties distracted. Two B-50
type aircraft were within the area as I requested the aircraft to
check on the red light. Both aircraft, which appeared to be about 25 miles
distant and eight thousand feet altitude, said they saw the red light. Five minutes later both aircraft
- passed me again calling "Redlight" and maintained their approximately
same quite a bit more, judging from the tone of their voices on direct line.
The weather was clear and visibility fifteen miles. The assistant
controllers on duty with me reported the object disappeared at approximately
2140 PST.

"While working in the control tower on the night of 31st of June 1953 I got a call from McClellen Towers. They asked me if I saw an object in the sky, and its color, which appeared south of their tower. I sighted the object at 2120 PST. It was red color, appeared about two thousand feet. The object was stationary near the father tower at approximately ten thousand feet. The object had no definite shape. It appeared as a light, large than an aircraft clearance light. It was stationary. At 2124 the lights disappeared. Nothing further could again. They seemed to be if I was near the object so up in a ball of fire and disappear. Nothing of that sort was sighted from our tower."

UNCLASSIFIED

On 30 June 1953 at approximately 2130 PST, I was an object in the sky. I was flying a T-6 aircraft in the vicinity of Sacramento, California, and while making a turn to the northwest corner of the area, I observed an object. The object was observed from the northwest corner of the area. There was no difference in the size or shape after viewing the object several times. I was flying at approximately 5,000 feet and was making several turns. The object was several minutes after they observed the same object that they were making a visual plan for sighting. I am an aircraft with a bank of instruments and a bank of instruments for sighting. Nothing was observed by others.
