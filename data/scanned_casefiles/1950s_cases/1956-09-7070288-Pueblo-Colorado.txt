(b) The lights were spread out in a diamond formation, equally spaced from each other.
(c) The lights dimmed and brightened in sequence, almost as if blinking, as they proceeded on a southeast course, steadily and silently.
(d) The lights appeared to be solid, not blinking lights on an aircraft.
(e) There was no sound associated with the lights.
(f) The lights were in view for approximately 3 1/2 minutes.
