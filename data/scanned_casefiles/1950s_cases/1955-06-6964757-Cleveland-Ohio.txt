3. DATE-TIME GROUP
Local ____ GMT 02/0132z June 1955

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
☒ Ground-Visual ☐ Ground-Radar
☐ Air-Visual ☐ Air-Intercept Radar

5. PHOTOS
☐ Yes
☒ No

6. SOURCE
Civilian (GO°) & Military

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
Fifteen (15) minutes

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one(1)

9. COURSE
Eastward

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) round object the size of a half dollar that at turns lengthening, was observed moving eastward very slowly at an estimated height of five hundred (500) feet. Object appeared yellow, red, and orange. Binoculars used.

11. COMMENTS
The characteristics of the UFO3 correspond with those of a balloon. The fact that a balloon launched from the Mabel Research Laboratory was estimated to be over this area at the time of sighting seems to substantiate the theory of the sighting being a balloon.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
