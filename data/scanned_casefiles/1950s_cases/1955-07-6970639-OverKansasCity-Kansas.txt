9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
   One (1), round, white object, leaving no contrails or exhaust appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 66,000 feet and heading SW at a speed estimated to be 1,300 knots. This object was sighted from a B-47 type a/c which was headed NE. No radar contact could be made with the object by ground radar.

11. COMMENTS
    Due to the lack of information on the original report on ATIC Form 164 has been sent to the observer. A check was made with COC Weather for possible balloon activity in the area and a check of winds at the time of the sighting, both with negative results. Upon receipt of the 164 sent to the source, this headquarters will inform ATIC of the conclusions drawn.
