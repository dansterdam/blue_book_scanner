COMMENTS
Due to the lack of information on the ATIC Form 164, this case has been sent to the observer who made winds at the time of the sighting for a check of possible balloon activity in the area and a check of winds at the time of the sighting. A copy of the 164 sent to the source, this headquarters will inform ATIC of the conclusions drawn.
