stated she was unable to give any estimate of the distance or
altitude at the time. She pointed out that she was in the
the area just west of her. Is pointed out to her that in her
opinion, the altitude was approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet.
She was in elevation above the horizon, and as mentioned above,
to her it was approximately twenty-five (25) degrees in elevation above the
horizon.

(5) Mrs. stated she is twenty-four (24), years old, not appeared
to be a college graduate. She was a high school woman and worked
as a telephone operator. She professed to be interested in
astronomical matters and stated that she had read about the subject
as she can. She stated that she made to sit in the observation
establishment or interview planners to make her statement. She is
familiar with the location of stars or constellations of the
universe at the time. She stated that she was not sure of the
"moving star" at first sight, but is the year first spent several
very clear nights according to her, and she was quite sure, she
saw every year at Christmas time but not so sure this year.
The interest was more in the nature of a casual observation, and
landing lights. She has no direct observation or identification
experience. She did not contact the news or other media or
anticipate public ridicule. Mrs. referred to this informant as very credible. It is the opinion of the interviewer
that her astronomical information is not very deep. She is
inclined to be somewhat confused in her statements, but under
normal conditions appears to be sincere.

C. No other statements were obtained from the observers other than that
by Dr. Gartwright hereafter received in closing this case or social or astronomical events which would provide their taking the necessary time.

Here is the text from the document:

/M/ Phone after 5 p.m.

About 8:05 p.m., I sighted what - took at first places to be an exceptionally bright star in the western sky, slightly north or due west. I was just leaving my parents home in the Coconut Grove section of Miami after Christmas dinner.

About five or six minutes later, arriving at my own home at Miami, I went into the house, came out again to get something out of the car. When I came out, my wife, who had stayed outside, said something about "What isn't it any star."

I stood in the yard for a couple of minutes looking at the light and decided for myself that it wasn't a star. It was dropping, faster than a star would drop and had moved from slightly north or west to slightly south of west. It's elevation at this time I estimated at about 30 degrees.

I took my camera out of the car and made a picture of the object, which is attached then continued to watch it. My wife went into the house to call one of her friends about the object, while she was in the phone, I saw the object continued its slow drift southward and toward the skyline.

When it was about 20 degrees above the horiz-on-not the skyline- it suddenly became very dim, assuming a reddish-like such like an ember. Then it flared to about a third its previous brilliance and went out. This took place in only two or three seconds, there was no gradual dying out of light. It was then about 8:20 p.m.

I continued watching, for a couple of minutes then went in the house myself. Still curious about the object, I went outside again, and moved around until I found the low spot in the skyline again in the light, much dimmer and time of yellow this time. It had moved quite a bit farther south and was very close to the skyline, about 10 degrees above the horizon. In a few moments it went below the skyline entirely.

The time then was 8:25.

A civilian man and woman at about 2005 hours on the night of 27 Dec 52 observed a very bright light in the Western sky. The light was observed for about 1/2 hour during which time it moved from the NW corner to the SW and finally disappeared below the skyline. The civilian source phoned a few friends and they also confirmed the presence of an unusual white light.

ATIC Comments: Very probably this is another observation of the Planet Venus by inexperienced observers.

Mrs. and Mrs. _______ Miami, Florida, observed a very bright light in the sky west of Miami at about 2035 hours on the night of 25 December 1952. The light was observed for about one half hour, at intervals, during which time it moved from the northwest quadrant to the southwest and finally disappeared below the skyline. _______ telephoned a friend and finally stated she, too, had seen a light but wasn't sure it was the same as the one shields had been observing. (Mrs. _______ apartment was the source of a party at the _______ and the standard all the guests were "pretty excited", consequently no very deliberate observation was made by anyone other than herself.

This office has no comment on the significance of the report other than that the observers evidently saw a very bright light or lighted object which was not familiar to them.

1. The following information is submitted in the order established in paragraph 73, AFR 200-5:

A. Observation by Whiteshields:

(1) As observed by the Whiteshields, the subject light was analogous, approximately three times as large as Venus when that point is at the peak of its brilliance and was not bit as an aircraft landing light. At approximately 2000 hours, while on a beach near Homestead, then flared to its previous brilliance and disappeared. After about five minutes it was again observed, lower in the sky, with as near its when it retained till most of its detail. Low the skyline. The observers were notable to distinguish any mechanical features. It was not certain of its size nor of how distant it was from this, he did, however, state that the object, viewed from a vantage point in Homestead, a traverse of forty (40) degrees in an hour. Two observers heard no sound and no low hum accompanying the object. The object was seen to other side of its straight course occasionally, and then to return to the previous path. In its second disappearance, the object also described as a "tendency to drift". The object disappeared the first time, as stated above, by apparent to be fading out, or extinguish quickly. Its second disappearance was caused by its being powered by the exhaust. No other permanent or unusual features were observed; however, it is worth noting that when the unwarped interval was between its time of vision was and that change could be attributed to the object, tall trees with heavily foliaged branches stood in the lines of sight.

(2) The subject light was first observed at approximately 2005 hours (C105*). It first disappeared at approximately 2220 hours (C102*). It was observed again at approximately 2024 hours (C112*) and again below the skyline and out of sight at approximately 2025 hours (C125*).

(3) The Whiteshields observed the object visually, using a pair of opera glasses only occasionally. They were standing on their screened-in porch or in the area still observing the 11 mm. F1.8 C-53 camera with a fifty (50) millimeter lens and "line 17 film". Both pictures were taken with no tripod or other mount for the camera. Its inclosed photographs was hand-held for the camera. At a level of F5.5. It was not certain whether the movement indicated in the pictures was caused by the exposure. Many parts of the subject light or this portion were the exposure. To develop the aerial 11 files himself, overexposing, thus losing a good deal of the image. The first picture was made on paper with a number ten (10) filter. The photographs were analyzed approximately ten (10) clusters. Estimated, he believes the second white spot in both photos was caused by camera movement.

some investigation or foreign substance in the camera. He de-
clared to point with the negative in the time was international,
stating he would do so only if it were strictly imperative.

(14) The windshields observed the object mainly from their position,
which is approximately 250' (COLS E). The exact location
of the object cannot be definitely by the individual. How-
ever its primary position in the northeast quadrant of the sky,
from which it was viewed to the southeast, was about 30° of
distance could be obtained. It moved in a generally southern
direction at an altitude which was not apparent other than as
being thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) degrees above the horizon
at first sight, approximately twenty (20) degrees in elevation
at 2220 hours (2220), and finally, approximately ten (10) de-
grees above the horizon.

(15) Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] is thirty-two (32) years old and is a veteran of
six (6) years in the Air Force. He was in ground crew ser-
vicing naval and marine aircraft during his service and was an
unlicensed amateur astronomer. He is a graduate of the Univer-
sity of Miami carrying a minor course of study
in Astronomy, is now studying astronomy and
meteorology, and stated that he is very interested in astronomy
in connection with the 1952 star catalog and has a well-equipped
with most of the constellations and is certain he was not con-
fusing this light he observed with any constellation or star known
to him, although at first glance he dismissed it as being Venus.
He stated that he had not been previously associated with news-
papers in connection with the incident and did not intend to do so.
Having willingly and rationally no further stated that as re-
lates the majority of recent news reports, they are aware of no
sort of desire for publicity and/or are awards. He appeared to
be sincere, cautious, observant, well-read, and was willing to
both he and his wife were very cooperative at all times. Mr.
[ILLEGIBLE] appeared to be quiet and conservative, but not so much
nor as unacceptable as her husband. She appeared to be about the
same age, she works as a telephone operator.

(16) Weather and winds aloft at the exact time of the sighting were
not available; however, the figures at 1700 hours (2200) and
2200 hours (3000) for this date on 25 December 1952 were as
