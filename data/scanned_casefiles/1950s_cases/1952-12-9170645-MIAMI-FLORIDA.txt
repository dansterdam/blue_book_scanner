Transcription of the text in the document:

About 8:02 p.m. I sighted what I took at first glance to be an exceptionally bright star in the western sky, almost directly north of Gast's house. This turned out to be one of my neighbors close friends in the Coconut Grove section of Miami after Christmas dinner.

Within a few minutes I went inside the house, came out again to get something out of the car. Then I went back inside and remained inside, said everything was all right.

About 10 min. or a couple of minutes later I was still looking at the light and decided for myself that it wasn't a star, it was dropping faster than a star would travel and more jerky erratic movements. It was at about 30 degrees altitude.

Then I took my camera out of the car and made a picture of the object, which is second exposure on the film. However, it was dark and the object was not plain to see in the picture, while I thought it could be seen plain by the eye. I told my friends about the object, while we were in the house, we didn't discuss it any further and my friends didn't go out to see it.

When it was about 20 degrees above the horizon - spot the sky was absolutely clear, not a cloud in sight. This took place in only two or three seconds, there was no gradual dying out of the light. It just went out.

I continued watching for a couple of minutes then went in the house around 8:25. I again turned the lights out and about 10 minutes later the object reappeared, but not quite so bright this time. It had moved quite a bit to the southeast and was very close to the horizon. About 10 minutes it went below the horizon.

The time then was 8:35.

APL 200-14. 29 April 1952, FLIGHT-T

The object was first sighted to the south of Miami, Florida, about 5:25 p.m. EST, visible to the civilian observer for about 2 minutes. It was described as a fiery, luminous object or "flying light" which was observed for some time in the sky west of Miami as about 20-25 thousand feet high. The intervals during which time it was visible from the first sighting was about 30 seconds. What appeared to be a cloud formation was noted, and then the object was again visible for about 30 seconds. This performance was repeated several times. The object did not give off any trail or vapor smear, and apparently made no sound. The weather conditions were clear, and the object's position was easily observed against a background of clear sky. Throughout the observation, no evasive action was taken, and the object moved at a fairly steady rate, the speed of which was not estimated. The object was very bright and appeared to be about 2 or 3 times the size of a star. The civilian observer stated that he was familiar with aircraft and their performance, and that this object was definitely not an aircraft of any type known to him.

This office has no comment on the significance of the report other than that the object presents a very bright light or luminous object which was not readily identifiable as a conventional aircraft.
