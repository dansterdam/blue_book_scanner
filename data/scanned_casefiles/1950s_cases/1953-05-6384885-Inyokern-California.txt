Inyokern, California                                                16 May 1953

I.    DESCRIPTION

The Inyokern Naval Air Facility at the Naval Ordnance Test Station received a report from one of their civilian employees that three cream colored objects were overhead at 1610 PST, and disappeared to the northeast climbing rapidly. Altitude was estimated to be approximately 20,000 feet with several over Inyokern. Objects appeared to be round and balloon-like with strings hanging down. No photographs were taken, exhaust or method of propulsion was undetermined, and no interceptors were attempted. Several other civilians are that action also observed these objects.

II.   DISCUSSION

This information was taken from a TWX received from the Flight Service Center at March AFB. Many details are lacking. The description as given by this one civilian fits that of three upper air research balloons (Moby Dick) tied together. More information will be available when the USAF from 112 is received. Also, Project Blue Book plots for all Moby Dick type balloons released in that area. The Project Blue Book evaluation of possibly upper air research balloon plots can be substantiated or cannot be substantiated upon receipt of the balloon plots.

III.  CONCLUSION

Possibly balloon (Moby Dick).
