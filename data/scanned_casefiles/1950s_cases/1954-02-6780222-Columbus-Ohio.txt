TO BE LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW IN THEIR LIVINGROOM AND CALLED HIS
ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS AN UNUSUAL STAR.
APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST SIGHTING SHE NOTICED
THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AND HAD COME CONSIDERABLY CLOSER AND
SHE INSISTED THAT SOURCE LOOK. WHEN SOURCE SIGHTED THE OBJECT
HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY A WEATHER BALLOON BEING
RELEASED AT PORT COLUMBUS. HOWEVER, AFTER CLOSER EXAMINATION THIS WAS
RULED OUT AND HE AND HIS WIFE DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE TO GET A BETTER
LOOK IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHAT THE OBJECT WAS (A) APPROXIMATELY
15 DEG, 345 DEG. (C) APPROXIMATELY 28 DEG, 240 DEG. (D) WHEN FIRST
OBSERVED THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 1,500 FEET ABOVE THE

TO WHAT THE SOURCE JUDGED TO BE 3,500 FEET. THEN IT STARTED ACCELERATING
IN ALMOST LEVEL FLIGHT TOWARD THE SOUTH-WEST AT AN EVER INCREASING RATE.
(E) WHEN LAST SEEN IT WAS AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 323 FEET.
GOING AWAY FROM SOURCE AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED

26 FEBRUARY 1954, COLUMBUS, OHIO

On the night of 26 February 1954, an unidentified flying object was sighted near Columbus, Ohio. The object appeared to be stationary and closely resembled a star in size and color. Shortly after the first observation, the object accelerated at a rapid rate in another direction, disappearing to a low altitude.

This case is concluded to have been an aircraft due to its characteristics and reported air activity in the area. Aircraft when at a distance and approaching head-on often appear to be stationary. Ascent might appear to be vertical for the same reason. After a turn is made, driving a new perspective, their acceleration is noticeable.
