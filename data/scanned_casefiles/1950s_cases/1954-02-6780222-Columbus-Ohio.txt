(B) ESTIMATED THE SIZE TO BE THAT OF A MEDIUM SIZED AIRCRAFT C-54 OR KC-97 FUSELAGE. (C) AT FIRST IT APPEARED A ROUND WHITE LIGHT WITH A LIGHT GREEN HALO. HOWEVER, AS IT APPROACHED IT APPEARED TO HAVE TWO RED LIGHTS UNDERNEATH WHICH TENDED TO FORM A V; THERE WERE WHITE-ORANGE COLORED LIGHTS WHICH WERE JUDGED TO BE INTERIOR LIGHTS. THE ENTIRE OBJECT WAS SURROUNDED BY A LIGHT GREEN HALO EFFECT. (D) ONE (E) N/A (F) THE RED LIGHTS UNDERNEATH TENDED TO FORM A V WHICH GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF A MAIN BODY WITH A GONDOLA OF SOME KIND

TO BE LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW IN THEIR LIVINGROOM AND CALLED HIS
ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS AN UNUSUAL STAR.
APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST SIGHTING SHE NOTICED
THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AND HAD COME CONSIDERABLY CLOSER AND
SHE INSISTED THAT SOURCE LOOK. WHEN SOURCE FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECT
HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY A WEATHER BALLOON BEING
RELEASED AT PORT COLUMBUS. HOWEVER, AFTER CLOSER EXAMINATION THIS WAS
RULED OUT AND HE AND HIS WIFE DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE TO GET A BETTER

TO WHAT THE SOURCE JUDGED TO BE 3000 FEET. THEN IT STARTED ACCELERATING
IN ALMOST LEVEL FLIGHT TOWARD THE SOUTH-WEST AT AN EVER INCREASING RATE.

DISAPPEARED WAS FROM FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES. AFTER THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED

26 FEBRUARY 1954, COLUMBUS, OHIO

On the night of 26 February 1954, an unidentified flying object was sighted near Columbus, Ohio, by civilian observers. The object appeared to be stationary and closely resembled a star in size and color. Shortly after the first observation, the object seemed to ascend vertically at a slow rate for some distance, then accelerated at a rapid rate in another direction, disappearing at a low altitude. The entire observation lasted from five to seven minutes.

This case is concluded to have been an aircraft due to its characteristics and reported air activity in the area.

Aircraft when at a distance and approaching head-on often appear to be stationary. Aircraft might appear to be vertical for the same reason. After a turn is made, giving a new perspective, their acceleration is noticeable.
