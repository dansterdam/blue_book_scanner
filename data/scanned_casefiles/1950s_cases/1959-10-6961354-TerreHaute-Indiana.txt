3. DATE-TIME GROUP  Various
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION  Ground-Radar
5. WEATHER  1/10 Cover

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION  Civilian
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS  Various
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: This case was investigated by Major Harold E. Taplin, USAF and presented at a conference at Wright-Patterson AFB. He investigated a possible UFO sighting by a civilian radar operator who tracked several unidentified targets at 5:10 PM on 9/29/59. The targets were observed on his radar at about 25,000 feet, traveling at high speed, estimated to be around 2,000 knots. The targets were observed on radar for about 4 minutes, then went off the screen. No visual sightings were made. The witness was a competent and experienced radar operator.
11. COMMENTS: This incident is listed in the USAF's SAFOI-34 (Project BLUE BOOK) file as a case of "possible equipment malfunction". The radar operator's observations indicated high-speed, maneuverable targets which could not be identified as known aircraft, satellites, etc. His competence and experience as a radar operator lend significance to this report. However, no visual sightings were made, so the possibility of equipment malfunction cannot be ruled out.

The text in the document is as follows:

30 DEC 1959

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

On 24 September 1959, you inquired in behalf of Mr. [REDACTED] concerning his sighting of an unidentified flying object on 13 October 1959 in Terre Haute, Indiana.
