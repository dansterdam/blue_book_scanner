The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a bright object high above it. The second sketch shows a road with a person standing in the foreground, and a curved landscape in the background. There are also two smaller sketches, one showing a person looking up at a bright object, and the other showing a more distant landscape.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

On October 9, 1958 at 7:40 P.M., Mountain Standard Time, on the Moose Creek road 13 miles north of Pinedale, Wyoming an unusual object was observed. This was the relative clear with a slight haze, visibility at about the same instance, we were sitting in a pick-up truck facing northeast when the object was observed with the naked eye (with eyeglasses) and then with X35 binoculars. We got out of the truck and watched for a period of 10 to 17 minutes which the object faded and could no longer be seen. The color, at first was a bright blush-green to light green color of varying intensity and quick sometimes. It remained the brightest object in the sky, much like a very bright star, until it disappeared. At times, a second object seemed to be present directly to the left but I believe this was a positive after-image.

1. This investigation, concerning an Unidentified Flying Object, was conducted by the Office of Special Investigations at the request of the Commandant, Strategic Air Force, Headquarters E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, on 5 December 1958. Basis for this investigation was a teletype message from Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, a copy of which is attached.

2. On 7 May 1959, Special Agent CHARLES A. SUTTON interviewed Dr. , Office. Drs. and , (30) miles north of Cheyenne, Wyoming, on 9 October 1958, at approximately 2000 hours MST (0800 hours, Z). They explained that while driving a moose hunting trip, some twenty (30) miles north of Cheyenne, Wyoming, on 9 October 1958, at approximately 2000 hours MST (0800 hours, Z), they had sighted an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sometime shortly after dusk. 

Flying Object (UFO) Sightings on 9 October 1958. Cheyenne, Wyoming, had sighted and they had observed the object for several minutes. This flying object, Unidentified Flying Object, was reported to the Department, Washington 25, D.C. In letter December 1958 they received acknowledgment, in which questions specified in paragraph 15, Air Force Regulation 200-2, dated 5 February 1958, were incorporated. They returned the questionnaire and their answers to all questions were as follows:

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Green River Lakes Area, Wyoming 
Date: 10/7/58
Hour: 23:00 Z
Description: A bright light, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, was observed hovering over the treetops.
Direction of Motion: Appeared to be wobbling or swaying back and forth in place.
Astronomical Phenomena: None reported.
Radar Analysis: None.
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Reliable sighting.
Analysis and Conclusions: The sighting appears to have been of an unidentified aerial object (UAO). The object's size, brightness, and apparent "hovering" motion are not easily explained by natural phenomena or known aircraft. Further investigation would be needed to determine the exact nature of this sighting.

QUESTION: What was the general behavior of the stars?
ANSWER: Stars normally seen in the sky from the observer's location appeared as usual. However, a small, brilliant, steadily luminous body from three to five times larger than any celestial bodies (other than the sun and the moon) normally seen in the sky, and was a light green in color-approximately equal to a reading of 500 on the spectrograph-with a possibly a slight bluish tinge. It appeared at times as a sphere, at other times as elongated ellipsoid. Its intensity of brightness varied; and it appeared to have a jerky, tumbling-like motion. Its path was erratic and changes of course were not affected by smoothly rounded turns, but rather as though influenced by a disturbing force, making sharp changes of course as if it followed some invisible lines, sometimes in a horizontal direction, sometimes vertical and sometimes diagonally turned in various legs of its course, and moved in an easterly direction at times, at other times in a westerly direction, and again in no specific geometric pattern. As previously explained in their answers to the AITO questionnaire, this appeared as a single body, although often, immediately after it had changed course, a smaller light appeared behind the main body. This they believe to have been an "after-light".

QUESTION: Did they appear as steady points of light, or did they appear to twinkle?
ANSWER: The light did not twinkle although, as previously pointed out, it varied in intensity-sometimes brighter, sometimes dimmer.

QUESTION: Was the estimate of size as seen through binoculars or with unaided eye?
ANSWER: Both. Celestial bodies normally seen were the basis of comparison.

QUESTION: Was the entire movement of object within field of binoculars, or were binoculars moved in order to keep object in sight?
ANSWER: The entire movement of the object was within the field of the binoculars, although it occurred over almost the entire field of vision of the binoculars. Binoculars used have a power of 8 by 50 and a field of 3.5 degrees.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting.

QUESTION: Was the elevation given for object above surrounding terrain, or above observer's horizontal plane? ANSWER: Above the observers' horizontal plane.

QUESTION: If possible, request observers draw a map of area indicating their precise location and nature of surrounding terrain, such as mountains, trees, etc. ANSWER: According to the text, the observers were able to establish their sighting location within one-quarter (1/4) of a mile on a United States Geological Survey topographic map of the area. They determined the object was approximately 13 degrees and 15 minutes North latitude, and 55 minutes West longitude. They stood at the northwest side of approximately one-quarter (1/4) mile in diameter and observed the object over a wooded area, with lower elevations continuing towards the southeast of Little Sheep Mountain. No trees or other vegetation intervened between the observers and the object.

QUESTION: What type of weather prevailed in the area prior to time of sighting, such as rain, storm, etc. ANSWER: Sky was completely clear, with visibility approximately 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

QUESTION: In addition to the above information, request any other pertinent data the observers may recall that might throw light on the sighting. ANSWER: Both said the object disappeared some seventeen (17) to twenty (20) minutes after their initial sighting. They observed that its brilliance faded gradually as it disappeared. Dr. XXXXXXX explained that he had previously observed SPUTNIK with the naked eye, and that SPUTNIK appeared to be of approximately the same size as, and similar in brightness to, the object sighted by him and his companions. He pointed out the following dissimilarities:

Referenced UFO was greenish in color, whereas STARTLINGs appeared to be yellowish-crescent.
Referenced UFO's light was of brighter intensity than that of STARTLING and extremely irregular erratic pattern of flight, whereas STARTLING travelled in a straight and steady course.
They said the moon was not in evidence. They did not believe that the vision was due to effects of heat waves or aurora borealis. He added that neither of them had imbibed in alcoholic beverages during the entire day of 9 October 1959.
On 8 May 1959, Dr. MOORE telephonically confirmed Dr. [redacted]'s answers to referenced questions.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

GENTLEMEN:

THE FOLLOWING PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVED BY DR. *** AND DR. ***

DATE AND TIME: OCTOBER 9, 1958 AT 7:40 P.M., M.S.T.

PLACE: ON THE MORSE CREEK ROAD IN THE BRIDGER NATIONAL FOREST, APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE GREEN RIVER LAKES AREA AND PINEDALE, WYOMING.

THE WEATHER WAS QUITE CLEAR WITH ALL STARS BEING EASILY VISIBLE FROM THIS REMOTE SECTION.

AT A COMPASS READING OF S.S.E., AT APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES OFF THE HORIZON, A BRIGHT BLUISH-GREEN OBJECT WAS OBSERVED. IT FIRST CAME INTO VIEW AND MOVED RAPIDLY SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE SKY WITH VARYING DEGREES OF BRIGHTNESS FOR A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN MINUTES. THIS OBJECT STAYED IN THE SAME GENERAL VICINITY BUT HAD A VERY ERRATIC MOTION WITH VARYING DEGREES OF BRIGHTNESS. IT REMAINED BRIGHT ENOUGH FOR THE GREATEST PART OF THE SIGHTING TO BE OBSERVED AGAINST THE STARRY SKY. DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES, IT GRADUALLY FADED AND COULD NO LONGER BE OBSERVED. THE VARYING INTENSITY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ON SPUTNIK. AT TIMES, A SECOND OBJECT SEEMED TO BE PRESENT BUT IT CAME CLOSE TO THE LARGER OBJECT ONLY TO RECEDE JUST PRIOR TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MAIN OBJECT.

WE, OF COURSE, WILL APPRECIATE YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THIS LETTER AND ANY FURTHER COMMENT, AS WE ARE MOST INTERESTED IN THIS PHENOMENON.

SINCERELY YOURS,

*** M.D.
