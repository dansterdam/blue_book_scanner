On October 9, 1958 at 7:40 P.M., Mountain Standard Time, on the Moose Creek road in the Bridger National Forest, near the Green River Lakes area some 45 miles north of Pinedale, Wyoming an unusual object was observed.

The weather was quite clear with all stars being easily visible.

The object was observed by Drs. [Redacted] and [Redacted] as well as myself, and at about the same instance, we were sitting in a stuck pick-up truck facing south-southwest when the object was observed with the naked eye (with eyeglasses) and then with 8X35 binoculars. We got out of the truck and watched for a period of 15 to 17 minutes after which the object faded and could no longer be seen.

This was approximately 20 degrees off the horizon, was of bright bluish-green to light green color of varying intensity and with very quick, erratic motion; however, the object stayed in the same general area at all times. It remained the brightest object in the sky, much like a very bright star, until it disappeared. At times, a second object seemed to be present directly to the left but I believe this was a positive after-image.

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Object, 9 October 1958,
Cheyenne, Wyoming

TO: ATIC (Wright-Patterson AFB)
Dir OSI

INFO TO: BC (F E Warren AFB)
DO # 5

1. This investigation, concerning an Unidentified Flying Object, was conducted by the Office of Special Investigations at the request of the Commander, Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, on 5 May 1959, in the absence of an Intelligence Officer on a 1006th Air Intelligence Service Squadron facility. Basis for this investigation was a teletype message from Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, a copy of which is attached.

2. On 7 May 1959, Special Agent CHARLES A. SUTTON interviewed [redacted] both of Cheyenne, Wyoming, at Dr. [redacted]'s office. Drs. [redacted] and [redacted] explained that during a moose hunting trip some thirty (30) miles north of Pinedale, Wyoming, on 9 October 1958, at approximately 2000 hours MST (0300 hours, 10 October 1958, Zulu Time), they and [redacted] D. e., Cheyenne, Wyoming, sighted an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO). Some two or three weeks later they wrote a letter reporting this sighting to the Unidentified Flying Objects Department, Washington 25, D.C. In latter December 1958 they received a questionnaire, in which questions specified in paragraph 15, Air Force Regulation 200-5, dated 5 February 1958, were incorporated. They returned the questionnaire and their answers to all questions to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio and subsequently received a letter of acknowledgement.

Drs. [redacted] and [redacted] answered questions specified in referenced TWX as follows:

WX: Clear, vis unlimited, Calm, 32° temp
Description: Angle, Bright, Light - Fluorin Green
- The Brightness & The Object Varied in Intensity

Direction of Motion: Electric Pole Crossing in Some Central Area

Satellite: (AFOIN-443, Phone 69219)

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): Possibly Formanhalt - 
Possibly Correlated with Antenna Layer of Warm and Co-o Air Established for the Other Effects

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably Very Good

Analysis and Conclusions: The Star Formanhalt was Low on the Horizon, But in the Area Where the Sighting Occurred Mountains Rolled the Horizon to Where This Object was Below and This Account Falls Out Responsibility ... Also the Expanded Pointing Out by the Witnesses About Toward Deformation and the Other Causes of This Sighting - Possibly the Star Formanhalt.

QUESTION:   What was the general behavior of the stars?
ANSWER:    Stars normally seen in the sky from the observers' location appeared as usual.

The unidentified flying object appeared as a bril-
liantly luminous body, from three to five times larger
than any celestial bodies (other than the sun and the
moon) normally seen in the sky, and was a light green
in color--approximately equal to a reading of 500 on
the spectograph--with possibly a slight bluish tinge.
It appeared sometimes as a circle, at other times as
an ellipsoid and at still other times as a greatly
elongated ellipsoid. Its intensity or brightness
varied; and it appeared to have a jerky, tumbling-
like motion. Its path was erratic and changes of
course were not effected by smoothly rounded turns,
but appeared rather as sharp angles. Between angular
corners at which changes of course occurred, the ob-
ject followed straight course lines, sometimes in a
horizontal direction, sometimes vertical and sometimes
diagonal; it both climbed and descended on separate legs
of its course, and moved in an easterly direction at
times, at other times in a westerly direction. It never
retraced any leg of its course; nor did it follow any
specific geometric pattern. As previously explained in
their answer to the ATIC questionnaire, this appeared as
a single body, although often, immediately after it had
changed course, a small light appeared behind the main
body. This they believe to have been an "after-light"
effect.

QUESTION:   Did they appear as steady points of light, or did they
appear to twinkle?
ANSWER:    The light did not twinkle although, as previously
pointed out, it varied in intensity--sometimes brighter,
then dimmer, then brighter again.

QUESTION:   Was the estimate of size as seen through binoculars or
with unaided eye?
ANSWER:    Both. Celestial bodies normally seen were the basis of
comparison.

QUESTION:   Was the entire movement of object within field of bin-
oculars, or were binoculars moved in order to keep object
in sight?
ANSWER:    The entire movement of the object was within the field
of the binoculars, although it occurred over almost the
entire field of vision of the binoculars as they were
held in a fixed position of aim. Binoculars used have
a power of 8 x 30; and the angle subtended is 8.5 degrees.

- page 13 -

QUESTION: Was the elevation given for object above surrounding terrain, or above observers' horizontal plane?
ANSWER: Above the observers' horizontal plane.

QUESTION: If possible, request observers draw a map of area indicating their precise location and nature of surrounding area, such as mountain ranges, trees, etc.
ANSWER: Neither felt that he could draw an exact map of the area. They were able to establish their sighting-time position, accurate to within one-quarter (¼) of a mile, on a United States Geological Survey topographical contour map of the Fremont Peak, Wyoming area, a copy of which is attached. As indicated by the "x" on this map, their position was approximately 43 degrees and 19 minutes North latitude, 109 degrees and 55 minutes West longitude. They stood at the north edge of a meadow approximately one-quarter mile in diameter and observed the object over a "saddle", or lower ground elevation, occurring between Little Sheep Mountain and the mountain peak next adjacent to the southeast of Little Sheep Mountain. No trees or other visual obstructions intervened between observers and object. The nearest trees in line of sight were on the far side of the meadow, which extended across the "saddle" center. Only the top of these trees were visible, and they were well below the line of sight from observers to object.

QUESTION: What type of weather prevailed in the area prior to time of sightings, such as rain, storm, etc.?
ANSWER: Sky was completely clear, with no clouds; visibility unlimited; no wind; temperature, approximately 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

QUESTION: In addition to the above information, request any other pertinent items the observers may recall that might aid in determining the nature of their sighting.
ANSWER: Both said the object disappeared some seventeen (17) to twenty (20) minutes after their initial sightings—that its brilliance faded gradually as it disappeared. Dr. [redacted] explained that he had previously observed SPUTNIK with the naked eye, and that SPUTNIK appeared to be of approximately the same size as, and similar in its tumbling effect to, the object sighted by him and his companions. He pointed out the following dissimilarities:

- page 14 -

a. Referenced UFO was greenish in color, whereas SPUTNIK appeared to be yellowish orange;

b. Referenced UFO's light was of light intensity than that of SPUTNIK; and

c. Referenced UFO described an extremely irregular, erratic pattern of flight, whereas SPUTNIK traveled a smoothly arcing course.

They said the moon was not in evidence. They did not believe any of the vision was due to effects of heat waves or aurora borealis.

Both Dr. [illegible] and Dr. [illegible] added that neither of them nor Dr. [illegible] is color-blind, and that none of them had imbibed in alcoholic beverages during the entire day of 9 October 1958.

3. On 8 May 1959, Dr. MOORE telephonically confirmed Dr. [illegible] and Dr. [illegible]'s answers to referenced questions.

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object.

Gentlemen:

The following phenomenon was observed by Dr. [redacted] and Dr. [redacted]

Date and Time: October 9, 1958 at 7:40 P.M., M.S.T.

Place: On the Moose Creek Road in the Bridger National Forest near the Green River Lakes Area and Pinedale, Wyoming.

The weather was quite clear with all stars being easily visible from this remote section.

At a compass reading of S.S.E., at approximately 20 degrees off the horizon, a bright bluish-green object was observed first with the naked eye and then more easily with the binoculars, for a period of fifteen to seventeen minutes. This object stayed in the same general vicinity but had a very erratic motion with varying degrees of brightness. It remained, for the most part, the brightest object in the sky, but after some fifteen to seventeen minutes, gradually faded and could no longer be observed. The varying intensity appeared much like the tumbling effect as had been observed on Sputnik. At times, a second object seemed to be present directly to the left, as observed from our position, but we believe this was a positive after-image.

We, of course, will appreciate your acknowledgment of this letter with any pertinent comment, as we are most interested in this phenomenon.

Sincerely yours,
[signature redacted]
M.D.
