4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Air-Visual

5. PHOTOS: No

6. SOURCE: Civilian, Indiana ANG Pilot

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 minutes

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

9. COURSE: East

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
A 31 year old former USAF pilot, now an ANG Capt flew an F-86A at 40,000 ft on 26 Nov, While W of Joliet, Ill at 0630 CST, he observed an obj about size of nickel first stationary, later disappearing eastward and slightly to the north. Source observed obj for about 10 minutes. When obj disappeared, source noticed 3 B-47's at 33,000 ft and attempted to contact them but was not successful. When he sighted UFO he notified Chicago ARTC radio. Rpt was conveyed to ADDC 30A Div WRAFS, Michigan.

11. COMMENTS:
Investigator contacted ACSW and FTS units in the area & two ADivs. No record of unusual sightings was found. No other persons appeared to have seen the object except the source. It appears probable that the B-47's at one time crossed the flight-path of the F-86. It also appears probable that their contrails reflected by the rising sun behind & below appeared to the F-86 pilot to be an unusual phenomena, as the sun rose sighting could have disappeared.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
[Checkboxes for: Was Balloon, Probably Balloon, Possibly Balloon, Was Aircraft, Probably Aircraft, Possibly Aircraft, Was Astronomical, Probably Astronomical, Possibly Astronomical, Other, Insufficient Data for Evaluation, Unknown]

Notes for UFO report in accordance with your instructions.

Date Interview Conducted: 9 December 1957

Interviewer: Capt George H. Janczewski, WPAFS Ext 70236

Source: Civilian, employee at Van Wart Airport, Ohio, member of the Indiana Air National Guard, 163 FIS

Content of the report: Source flew an F-86 A at 44,000 ft on 26 Nov 1957. While about 15-20 miles west of Joliet, Ill., Source sighted an unidentified object in the sky. The direction of Source's flight was eastward. The object appeared at a relative bearing of 15°. Source described the object as yellowish in color, at first stationary and hazy and later appearing to move and assuming definite outlines. Source observed from about 100 minutes and pursued its approach. The object gained in size and when he put his index finger on the aircraft's windshield it appeared no larger than a nickel. Source contacted Chicago ARTC and informed them of the sighting. The message was conveyed to ADC senior controller at 30 AMW at WRAPS, Michigan who filled the original report.

Source stated that approximately five minutes after his sighting, UFO has disappeared from his sight by fading in the distance and turning slightly left, he noticed a flight of 3 B-47s going eastward. Source descended and attempted to contact the B-47s to verify his sighting but was not successful in contacting the aircraft. He landed his aircraft at Fort Wayne, Ind., which was his temporary home base. He immediately filed a report with his base commander.

Questioned about the size, shape, speed and altitude of the object Source markedly explained that he had no basis of comparison to make any definitive characteristics or performance of the object. Except for slight turn to the left the object made no other maneuvers. Source said it seemed to have accelerated as he closed in. The object was somewhat flat, metallic in appearance.

Investigation: Interviewer talked with Mr. [redacted] personally and questioned him in details. ATIC Form 164 is attached. Following the interview the following units were contacted:

Hq 20th Air Div, WRAPS, Michigan
Hq 20th Air Div, Grandview AFB, MO
Hq 791st ACW SQ, Hanna City AFS, Ill.
Hq 319 Ftr Intercept SQ, Bunker Hill AFB, Ind.
Hq 782 AC&W SQ, Rockville AFS, Ind.

All of the above units reported no unusual sightings or incidents on that date and at that time. The FIS reported no aircraft in the area.

The Wright Operations Officer was contacted and said there were no WADC aircraft in the area at that time.

The officer who filed the original report, Capt Best, Senior Controller, AICG 30th ADW said he checked the air traffic at that time and found no unusual incidents. Chicago ARTC contacted by Capt Best on 20 Dec stated there were no other report regarding the sighting except the one from Mr. Rice.


- page 6 -

Conclusion: The interviewer believes that the B-47s could have crossed the flight path of the F-86 at one time in the general area of the sighting. Considering the early hour of the day it appears probable that the B-47s contrails were illuminated by the rising sun from below and behind. This could have appeared to be an unusual phenomena. I realize that the B-47s were at about 33,000 ft while the F-86 was at about 44,000 ft. However, the pilot stated that the day was very clear and there were no clouds whatever. These conditions would have resulted in the sighting being observed by other people in addition to the pilot. Considering the lack of such evidence and the relative angles of the F-86 to the B-47s contrails and the rising sun this conclusion appears most probable.
