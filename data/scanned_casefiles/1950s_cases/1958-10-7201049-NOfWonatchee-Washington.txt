THIS OFFICER HAS ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE, GOOD POWERS OF
OBSERVATION AND AS EXCELLENT KNOWLEDGE OF TECHNICAL MATTERS. HOWEVER,
HE HAS AN AVID INTEREST IN SCIENCE FICTION WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY HAS A
STRONG INFLUENCE ON HIS THINKING. WHAT HE SAW WAS PROBABLY A HIGH
ALTITUDE LIJHT LIKE THE P-38A, BUT THE PRESENCE OF SUCH AIRCRAFT IN THE
AREA IS DOUBTFUL.
