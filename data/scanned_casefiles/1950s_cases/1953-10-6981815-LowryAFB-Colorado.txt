SYNOPSIS: Investigation initiated by District Commander. Four airmen reported unidentified balloon-shaped object at approximately 1955 hours, 19 October 1953. Statements obtained from airmen indicate that a light-colored, balloon-shaped object was observed slowly drifting in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. Object appeared to be about 75 feet in diameter, and was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes, after which it disappeared from view. Weather balloon released by Lowry Air Force Base at 2000 hours, 19 October 1953, was observed and considered to be another light-colored, balloon-shaped object. It was concluded that the object sighted was the weather balloon released by Lowry Air Force Base.

THIS INVESTIGATION WAS INITIATED BY THE 2ND AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS, BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE, LOUISIANA, ON 12 OCTOBER 1953. TWO OFFICERS IN A T-33 JET TRAINER AIRCRAFT OBSERVED A FAST-MOVING OBJECT AT APPROXIMATELY 18,000 FEET ALTITUDE NEAR LOWRY AIR FORCE BASE, COLORADO AT APPROXIMATELY 1930 HOURS, 19 OCTOBER 1953.

THIS INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED BY SPECIAL AGENT JOHN C. CAMPBELL AND 2ND LT. JOHN R. BELL, AF INTELLIGENCE.

AT LOWRY AIR FORCE BASE, COLORADO

On 20 October 1953, Special Agent J. C. CAMPBELL and 2ND LT. JOHN R. BELL, AF INTELLIGENCE, interviewed four officers who had observed a fast-moving object in the vicinity of Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, on 19 October 1953.

"This object appeared first while we were walking alone. Two other flights in the area were also making flights near the base at that time. The object was sighted by us at approximately 1930 hours, 19 October 1953, at an estimated altitude of 18,000 feet. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, much faster than our jet aircraft. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and was very bright, a whitish color. As we watched, it made an abrupt 90 degree turn and accelerated rapidly, disappearing from our sight in a matter of seconds. It did not leave a vapor trail. Last saw object disappearing to the northeast. Toward the end of the sighting, the object appeared to be quite bright and seemed to illuminate the area underneath it. The time of the sighting was approximately 2350 hours, 19 October 1953.

"I, DAVID G. TOWNE, /1LT, AF 13 403 919, STUDENT SQUADRON, LOWRY AFB, COLORADO, DO HEREBY STATE THAT JOHN R. CAMPBELL HAS QUESTIONED ME IN REGARD TO THE SIGHTING OF A FAST MOVING OBJECT NEAR LOWRY AIR FORCE BASE, COLORADO, ON 19 OCTOBER 1953."

DETAILS (cont'd):

as a special report of the office of special Investigation, United States Air Force, and have a bearing on unexolained aerial phenomena under investigation by that office. The details follow:

The appearently very bright object was first sighted at about 1p45 hours, 29 October 1953. at Lowry AFB in Colorado. The object appeared to have been traveling in a northeast direction and was observed for about 5-7 minutes before disappearing from view. The object was described as brilliant in nature, about the size of a basketball, and traveling at a high rate of speed. As the object passed over the observers, it appeared to give off light beams and was trailing what appeared to be a light beam or smoke trail. The light seemed to vary in brilliance making the object appear to expand and contract. The object was observed to make a slight change in direction during its flight. No sound whatever was heard during the sighting.

I further state that I have read this entire statement, initialed all the pages and corrections, and affirmed that the same is correct and true as written.

"On 2 Septerbe. 1953 an I visUl observation was made of an object described as a t'specia.l type of aircraft, the flight characteristics of hich appeared to be out of the ordinary." United States Air Force personnel (including Lt. Baker) observed the object on that date at approximately 1130 hour-s, Lowry A T3, Colorado.

"I was ranting this Sevrica Club at Lowry AF, Colorado, with a 1/2 window observer on 22 March 1955. At about 1350 hoxr-s, I observed a light noving in a steady downward direction, appeared to be bright and bright colored as it. descenzdd. The light looked like an airplane but I cannot say definitely that it was an airplana. The light appeared to be coming from the general direction of the area which the o.jcct in question had been observed. The light appeared to have a definite path of motion and did not deviate from it. The light continued in a steady downward direction until it passed out of my sight near the horizon. I was unable to estimate the size, speed, or altitude of the object. The light appeared dim brighter at first when first observed and then grew dimmer as it descended until it passed from sight. I saw no details other than the light itself. The object did not appear to be lighted or illuminated. It simply appeared to be a light in motion coming from the direction where the previous observation had been made. I did not hear any sound at aru time. The light did not resemble the usual appearance or flight characteristics of ccwrent types of aircraft.

"Statement of 2/Lt Vai J. Giles Jr.: 

19 October 1953

At approximately 19:30 hours on 19 Oct 53 I came out of the officers club at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado and observed a strange object in the sky. The object was extremely bright and appeared to be circular in shape. The object appeared to be hovering or staying in one position. I watched the object for approximately 15 minutes. During this time the object appeared to change position slightly and then would return back to the original position. At one time the object appeared to emit a very bright flash of light. After observing the object for approximately 15 minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I am unable to estimate the exact size of the object but I would say it was reasonably large. I am also unable to estimate the exact distance of the object from my position, but I would say it was a considerable distance away. The object did not appear to show any lights as the ground or buildings. The sky was clear and there was no other aircraft in the area that I could observe. I have never seen anything like this before and I can find no explanation for what I observed."
