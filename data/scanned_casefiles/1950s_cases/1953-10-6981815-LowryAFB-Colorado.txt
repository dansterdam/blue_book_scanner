DETAILS:

1. This investigation was initiated by the District Commander, predicated
upon information received from the Airsome Officer on 19 October 1953 to the
effect that four airmen had reported an unidentified aerial object over Lowry
AFB, at approximately 1930 hours, 19 October 1953.

2. This investigation was conducted by Special Agents JOHN G. CAMPBELL
and GUY G. BATES.

AT LOWRY AFB FT. DENVER, COLORADO:

3. At 2035 hours, 19 October 1953, Special Agent CAMPBELL, Duty Agent, re-
ceived a telephone call from 1st Lt LEONARD L. SHORT, AO 784205, 341514 Air Force
Group, Airborne Officers on 19 October 1953, in which he stated that four airmen
had reported to him that they had seen a "flying saucer" at 1930 hours this date.
Lt. SHORT furnished Special Agent CAMPBELL with notes he had taken from the air-
men which included their names, ranks, serial numbers and organizations. Ac-
cordingly these notes are as follows:

"/O DAVID G. BUSH, AF 16 403 619, 2808th Squadron

"/JO James R. ALDRICH, AF 16 469 398, 2808th Squadron

"/JO ANDREW L. VAN HOESEN, JR., AF 29 661 138, 2808th Squadron

"/JO WILLIAM G. JONES, AF 13 438 787, 2808th Squadron

4. "JOHN ALDRICH stated that while walking along, saw other three motion-
ing toward objects. All four just together and watched. Object (light) moving
very erratically, stopping, starting up and down, fading very slowly, visible
for approximately five minutes while light bright and yellowish. Then first
sighted was westerly but after a few minutes it was over islands. Object
stopped and hovered. Seemed to make very slight movement. Appeared to be quite
low over Lowry moving in northerly direction. No definite shape, just a light
with an odd can shape. Seen as an object disappear to northwest. Upward
spiral noted when disappeared. Moved straight across sky."

5. At approximately 2250 hours, 19 October 1953, the above airmen were
summoned to the OSI office where they executed statements setting forth their
recollection of the incident. The body of these statements are set forth ver-
batim herewith:

as a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air
Force, and that I do hereby voluntarily and of my own free will make the follow-
ing statement which, having been duly sworn, I solemnly swear is true to the best
of my knowledge, information, and belief, and without any promise of reward, benefit or any im-
munity having been made to me:

"At approximately 1940 hours 19 October 1953 airman 1st C. MARTIN came
into the Lowry 3 cafeteria and asked me to come outside and he had something
to tell me. We went outside and he stated that while on a mission from 1st C.
policing up into the sky and I looked up and saw what appeared to be a light
below the clouds mile were at about 15-20,000 feet. The light looked at first
like a distant star, clear first light, of a white color with a slight
yellowish cast. It did not flicker or shimmer but remained a steady light.
It looked very tiny but very clear and very bright but appeared to be at a rather
troubled distance. It appeared to be moving very slowly, almost stationary, northerly direction from a southerly-southeast direction. The light appeared to
remain at about 70-80 degrees above the horizon. It was following a very definite course, not a herd planned
ly overhead. It appeared to be following a spiraling course, without direction. It appeared to be more of a high-speed drifting spiral without direction. It apparently was in a small area, possibly 20 degrees on the horizon, fading
clearly from view. I observed no violent jerk only a mild wobbling. I heard
no sound whatsoever and did not see any light on the ground. I saw the light
for approximately four or five minutes. I did not see any resemblance of shape
but it appeared to be an aircraft light in intensity and brilliance but much
smaller. I saw no other stars in the particular area of sky in which the object was. I then appeared to be depth to the light insomuch as it did not vary
in brilliance when passing clouds covered over it. I do not think it was a
star or an airplane. The sky was broken with clouds drifting about; the moon
was brilliant and appeared to be about 1/2 to 3/4 degrees at a 70-80 degree
elevation.

aircraft and electronics.

pages and corrections and signed this statement, and that it is correct and
true as written.

13 October 1953

"I, James L. ARTHUR, A/3C, AF 14689 298, 3427th Student Squadron, Lowry AFB, Colorado, hereby make this 13th of October 1953 statement voluntarily as a special agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air Force, and that I do hereby voluntarily aid of my own free will make the following statement without having been subjected to any coercion, unlawful inducement, and without any promise of reward, benefit, or any immunity having been made to me:"

"I was leaving the Service Club at Lowry AFB, Colorado, with a A/3C Van SICLEN at about 1830 hours 13 October 1953 when I first noticed a light in the sky out in 188. The light was to the left of the moon and below it. I soon saw it already part way up in the sky but it wasn't fully risen. I thought that the light looked like an aircraft light but with a dimmed glow and was a steady light, kind of a yellowish-white. The light appeared to travel at a rapid speed toward the north. I don't have any item as to the actual height of the light or its speed. The light seemed to come to a complete stop to the left and above the moon where we could get a glimpse of what it was. It made a sort of half circle. I don't recall with accuracy the altitude or the exact north-south line. In a spiraling motion and kept in that motion until it faded out of sight. It stayed altogether in our sight about 10 or 15 minutes from the time we first saw it until its disappearance. The quality of the light was dull, almost hazy. I didn't hear any sound at all from the object and did not send any light signals to the ground. All 15 looked like to me just a blob of light but I can't describe for what it was. I'm pretty sure it wasn't an airplane though, while we were watching the light another airman named JONES walked by and asked us what we were looking at. I said to him the light as I saw it. He said that he saw some light come over the horizon and had followed it with his eyes to its present position. I went and got airman JONES from the cafeteria during this time we first saw the light and he joined us at watching the and calling the Airman Officer and reported it after it disappeared."

"I am 17 years of age and have been in the USAF since April 1953 and have been stationed at Lowry AFB since August 1953."

"I further state that I have read this entire statement, initialed all the pages and corrections, and signed this statement, and that it is correct and true to the best of my knowledge."

"I, ANDREW L VAN SICKLE, A/3C, AF 28651265, 1st Student Squadron, Navy
Air Force Base, Colorado, hereby state that JOHN B. CAMPBELL has identified himself to me as a special agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air Force, and that I do hereby voluntarily and of my own free will make

"At approximately 1130 hours 12 Oct 53 I came out of service club (a at
Lowry AFB) out of the door facing south. As I came out I looked up toward
the sky and saw a bright object which looked to be a very bright star which was
motionless in the sky. I checked it was moving because I was moving but when
I noticed it to my buddy, A/3C JAMES ARTHUR he said to stop and see if it
still moved. He stopped and looked carefully. He watched the object and 16
remained to a point where it appeared to be directly above us at which time the
object stopped and just stayed where it was. As we watched the object for a
few minutes it began to move again slowly in a northeasterly direction and then
it stopped again and A/3C ARTHUR ran over to the cafeteria and got AIRMAN POWERS
out to look at it. We all looked at the object for a few minutes while the object remained motionless, and then AIRMAN POWERS came up to us and asked us if
another AIRMAN when I believe to be named JONES came up to us and asked us if
we were looking at the object at which he was looking and we replied that we
were. He watched the object until 12 finally disappeared from sight moving
up in the sky. Before it did disappear however, it did some tricky maneuvering
in the sky. I blinked my eyes as it started to disappear and then looked at
the object again as when I was first appeared to be one object but as I re-focused on the object I could see that it was just one. The color of the object
appeared to be a white light. I did not hear any sound whatsoever and I have no
idea as to the height of the object in the sky but it was high and it was in the
sky. It did not appear to be leaving any trails and I could not see the any details of the object as to its outline, shape or form. It looked like a light in
the sky. The object did not appear to be very large. The time I know because I checked
my watch when I first saw the object and when it disappeared from my view. The
object did not appear to shed any light on the ground or buildings. The sky

was clear at the time and the moon was in the process of rising as I do not
recall that it was high in the sky at the time. After the object disappeared
to the earth, apparently straight up in the sky, Airman Donald called the Air
Force Office and reported what he had seen.

"On about 1330 hours 19 October 1953 I was at Lowry & Base the parking
lot near the Base Service Club, only on the far end of the parking lot, to
southeast and of it. I was walking just and just above the horizon I saw a
white-to-yellow light which appeared to get brighter no it not closer and appeared
to come toward me as a rather rapid approach. I watched it as I walked. Next and
then turned north by the Base Theatre #2 and before I got to the Theatre the
object appeared to be very bright and appeared to stand stationary above me, and
then as I started to walk off the light suddenly took off from a stationary
moving slowly, raised speed and then stopped dead. It appeared to make a slight
turn to the south as when the light first stopped it was the by a counterclockwise
turning. Van Nolan and Van Nolan were watching the object. I noticed that the light
appeared to move in a spiraling motion, a zig-zagging maneuver when it moved
toward me as I first saw it. I didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The sky
was clearly with some broken places and the moon while not bright was "blurry".

The original copies of the above statements are being retained in the files of this district office and will be made available upon authoritative request.

a. On 0100 hours, 20 October 1953, Special Agent CAMPBELL telephonically contacted the Intelligence Section, 114th Weather Detachment, Lowry AFB Base, to ascertain whether they released a weather balloon. A/1c ROUSH, A/1c 224 471, on duty at the Radiosonde Section, advised that on 19 October 1953, Rawinsonde balloon with a yellow-white light hanging from it for tracking purposes was sent up from the south north of Lowry AFB Base. In addition, HOGAN outside the building and just then saw a flickering whitish light high in the sky in the northwest area. It too appeared to shape color slightly and to create about the size in a small area. CAMPBELL called the weather station for a board and they confirmed his observations as to the light being that attached to the balloon.

b. On 20 October 1953, Special Agent OTT G. BATES personally advised Captain WILLIAMS CIC-4581, A2 28807, A-9, 348th Technical Training Wing, of the information possessed by this office.
