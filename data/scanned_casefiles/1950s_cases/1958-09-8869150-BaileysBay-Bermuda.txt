TO: ARCH-LSI                     FROM: ARCH-LSI

SUBJECT: Evaluation of UFOB Report dated 19 Sep 58

1. It is very difficult to understand exactly what happened from the meager information in this report. For instance one must guess whether the scope returns at the GCA and GCI stations occurred at the same time or if not, which occurred first, and on. From the description given one might conjecture anything from an aircraft or balloon to false targets or weather phenomena as possible causes for the reported radar returns.

2. In view of the meager information given and the failure to make any visual observation from other ground or air, it is considered likely that weather phenomena and/or equipment malfunction was responsible for the reported radar phenomena.
