PITOERT submitted by Olmsted Flight Service Center 17 July (1709h42)

Crew of a scheduled airlines aircraft in flight observed an unidentified flying
object, in the form of a ball or "luminous fire" near Washington, D. C. at 0300-03T
13 July.

Object approached the observers aircraft, then maintained a parallel course, on
the same level, at the same speed, until the aircraft pilot turned on all lights. Object
then departed from the vicinity at an estimated 1000 MPH.

The aircraft crew are apparently thoroughly experienced in observation of and from
aircraft. Weather was excellent for observation.

Intelligence Officer, 316th Troop Carrier Wing

1. The following is a summary of a report of an unidentified flying object sighted in the vicinity of Dyersburg, Tenn.

Mr. [redacted] of Memphis reports sighting the following unidentified flying object:

(1) The object was small, "like the size light of an aircraft". The color was gray. It appeared round in shape, round and traveling much faster than a conventional aircraft.

(2) The object traveled horizontally with the earth, and traveled much faster than a jet aircraft. Its propulsion to and from a point in the sky was not observed, and disappeared as if over the horizon.

(3) Close observation was made visually from the ground.

(4) The observer was with a group at the Reelfoot Lake area, about ten miles north of Dyersburg, Tenn. The object was traveling northwest, and the altitude was about 1,000 to 2,000 feet.

(5) The observer had no witnesses near him (son concerned). He is partner in the firm of [redacted] at Memphis, Tenn. No comparable sightings were made.

(6) Weather was fair and still. Although the sun had set and the stars were visible, the object was clearly outlined.

(7) Not applicable.

(8) The above description is the same object was sighted by other personnel of this office and the Naval Air Station at Millington, Tenn., at the approximate same time.

(9) The witness described the object sighted from the Naval Air Station (about ten miles north of Lewisburg location) appeared to be the same object. Also, another witness who saw the object appeared to slow down and drop a considerable distance, then accelerate and drop again. The Williams varied and light seemed to fade, showing the object slowed down.

Attached: The object was sighted over the Memphis Commercial Appeal. He and several people at Reelfoot Lake, near Dyersburg, Tenn., saw an object at the same time.

Since the factors related in the three individual sightings appear to coincide.

These reports are of the same object flying somewhere over the Town, Tyr, line area. Altitude may range from 1,000 to 2,000 feet, it is possible at a much higher altitude.

FROM: 4705TH DEFENSE WING
REPORT NO: 4705 LW-52-52    PAGE 1 OF 2

1. One oblong shaped yellowish lightish object was sighted by an F-86 pilot while on routine GCI mission. The object was purely a visual sighting. Briefly stated, it was too dark to give many details or the object itself. The object was followed by a trail or exhaust which was normal for the type of object. The object was about the object's length, and was the same color but of less intensity. The speed was approximately 300-400 knots. The pilot's navigation system was evident and no sound was heard. The speed was conservatively estimated as 300 to 700 knots. The pilot was flying a general horizontal flight path. During this sighting the pilot was relaying pertinent information on object to GCI control.

2. Time of sighting was 2101, over (coords 13 Jul) 12 Jul 52. Length of sighting was twenty (20) seconds.

3. The observation was made from an F-86 airborne at 15,000 feet to 12,000 feet. Observation speed was near the same for F-86.

4. The observer had just leveled out of a right hand turn onto a heading of 200° and was over the town of Arlington, Ill. when he sighted the object. He immediately turned slightly to the right (south) and observed the object which was at 12 o'clock, 15 miles distant. The pilot put the F-86 to 100% power. The object was at an elevation of 22,000 feet and on a heading of 200 as was calculated from the observer at this time. During the next 20 seconds of stern chase the object rapidly pulled away.

While flying westbound (250 degrees) 25 minutes North of Dayton, Ohio at 6000 feet, I observed at 2105 hours CDT an object first presumed to be a "falling star". It traveled in an arc approximately 10 degrees above the horizon from the left to the right. It appeared to be traveling from SE to NW about 1500 to 2000 M.P.H. The intense brilliance of the object plus its abrupt disappearance leads me to believe it was not a meteorite or "falling star". If so, it behaved as I've never seen one do before.

At approximately 2105 DST I was sitting on the front porch at 11 Old Main Road, Chanute Gardens - I was leaning back on my elbows watching the sky where a small light from a weather balloon had been observed about 10 minutes previously - suddenly a brightly lighted object appeared directly above Hanger #IV, and stationary. It began to move almost immediately, to the right (west), and disappeared in approximately three (3) seconds. It was dark red in the center, with a orange tint around the edges. As it began to move, it accelerated at a tremendous rate, and appeared to slant up. There was a orange color trail behind the object as it accelerated, giving it the appearance of a comet.

At approximately 2150, I sighted what appeared to me to be a "falling star", however, the object coming out of the southeast appeared to level out and continue on a course of northwest. It appeared, that, at the first where the object leveled off it became very bright and appeared as a ball of fire with a tapering tail. The object continued northwest at a very fast speed - the intensity of the flame became less and it appeared that the object started up in its course when I lost sight of it.

This all took place within a period of approximately 5 to 7 seconds. The apparent speed was constant throughout.

At approximately 2045 hours one radiosonde balloon with lantern attached was observed traveling towards NNE at altitude of 1500-2000 feet. At approximately 2100 hours, I observed a rocket-like ball of fire(with a short orange or red tail of flame) traveling at a high rate of speed towards the NW. No noise was heard and after about seven (7) seconds, this flare disappeared. There were no other objects noted in the sky at this time.

This observation was made at the rear of building P-103A, at CHANUTE AFB, Ill.

At 2100 hours I went out of Operations for a smoke and was sitting down, looking up at the stars, when all of a sudden a bright light appeared in a southeastern position of the sky. It appeared to go in a westerly direction at a great speed. I can't say if it disappeared or the light went out. I came into Operations and informed the A. O. of the incident, and also checked with the tower and they had not seen it. In my opinion I can't say what it might have been except a comet because the tail it had behind the object, and also the color of it, which was sort of orange around the outer surface and white in the center.

Stationary light at four (4) minutes after nine (9). Light moved to right at an unlimited speed, with a tail of light having a point on the extreme end.

I was on the porch with M/Sgt Woodley, my house is located at 11 Old Main Road, Wherry Units. It did not in any way resemble a vapor trail. This is one opinion as I am in no way qualified as an observer.

[Location], Illinois
July 1952

UNCLASSIFIED
12 July

I was part of a group at the beach near Bridgman, Michigan around 2100 hours Saturday. Eight of us saw a bright light move rapidly from East to West in the southern sky. This spot of light looked rather like the spot made by a search light such as is used by carnivals when the light hits low clouds. The path of this spot was nearly parallel to the horizon. After traveling roughly half way across the southern sky the light simply disappeared. There was some haze over the lake so that there was no definite outline to the spot and it probably appeared much larger than it actually was. I cannot say what its elevation above the horizon may have been - again because the true horizon was obscured by haze, but I would estimate this at about 20 degrees.

Subject: Unknown object observed by Captain George D. Keller

Ozark Airline's Flight 305 departed Chicago at 1930 CST. The flight was conducted at an altitude of 4000 feet MSL and in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. The crew consisted of Captain George D. Keller, First Officer R. Bullard and Stewart C. Nathe.

First Officer Bullard was flying the aircraft from the left seat; the undersigned was in the right seat. As the flight approached Beckley, Illinois, First Officer Bullard called my attention to an object moving at right angles to our course. The course of Flight 305 was 190 degrees magnetic. The object was from two to five degrees in an upward line to our line of vision; our aircraft being in level flight at the time it was observed and for the balance of the observation, which lasted for approximately fifteen seconds from the time it was called to my attention by the First Officer.

The object was in a definite horizontal line of flight traveling from the East, Southeast - to the West, Northwest. As the western horizon was still showing light from the sun, the object disappeared at about two o'clock level. The color was that of intense white, with a very small tail. My description as to-the size would closely resemble that of jet aircraft at night on a ground run-up from 500 feet distance. The speed of the object was great. The total time observed by both the First Officer and myself was probably thirty to forty seconds at the First Officer and I watched it far sometime before he realized it was crossing our course and he did not know what he was looking at.

Sincerely yours,
/s/ George D. Keller

We were in level flight over Buckley, Illinois at an altitude of 4000 feet MSL with a heading of 190 degrees. I noticed a white hot-light, at first I thought it was a reflection on the windshield. When I realized it wasn't a reflection, I called the Captain's attention to it.

The time I observed the light was about twenty seconds. It moved as far as I could tell from East to West across the nose of our airplane. As the light went to the West, it appeared to snuff out or disappear. While in view the object was horizontal to the ground. The time of this observation was about 200% CST.

While my wife, [redacted] and I were walking across the Chanute Air Force Base golf driving range, I noticed a bright light in the sky to the south and above it, igneous above the horizon. I thought it was a meteor and I called to my wife to look. She did not see it. I then observed a spherical shape with a tall like a candle, or a ball in a northwesterly direction in a straight trajectory parallel to the apparent horizon. The color of the light was slightly yellow, faded blue sky of dusk. Stars were just becoming visible and I was amazed at the object. Like the speed moved through about fifty degrees of arc in about five seconds before being lost from sight.

Teletype PIGEON-T submitted by Wright-Patterson Flight Service Center 13032352 July

Numerous reports of sighting of unidentified object(s) on the night of 12 July were received by 1st Mid-Continent Filter Center. These objects appeared to be similar or coast type objects, travelling parallel to the surface at a very high speed (with two low and one radar report). A preliminary survey of the Chicago area, at approximately 7,000 to 10,000 feet altitude. Reports are not verified, other than by each officer, and reporting witnesses are unknown, but accounts are believed to be reasonably reliable.

Observatory records have not been examined for evidence of meteor or comet type phenomenon which might have caused the reports.

1. One or more unidentified flying objects were sighted by observers in Indiana, Illinois, and Eastern Missouri on the night of 12 July 1952. Objects(s) was (were) described as similar to a meteor, but moving horizontally at a speed too slow for a meteor, then moving apparently Northwest to West.

2. Reports, as received by Wright-Patterson Flight Service Center, follow:

a. Maj. [name redacted] who lives one mile East of Atteberry Air Force Base, Columbia, Indiana, saw an object moving Northwest which flew too long to be a meteor. (from Auxiliary AFB tower at 2120CST)

b. Three people in the airport control tower of Terre Haute Airport, Indiana-polis, Indiana observed (with field glasses) a bright white light at a long glowing trail, traveling as a very high speed, 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon, 210 degrees from their position. The trailing tail of the mass was white. Light with a sudden and covered a 300 arc in five seconds. (from Indianapolis tower 2065CST)

c. Captain [name redacted] and First Officer [name redacted], Flight crew of American Airlines Flight 376 (Conway), within an the vicinity of Greenfield, Indiana at 2105CST, object heading 3000, approximately parallel to them. It seemed to head down 150, the first two and one-half minutes of observation it was not a conventional aircraft and traveled too slowly. (Report received 2125CST)

d. Capt. [name redacted], pilot of Cessna N17771, was flying a heading of 2200, distant about 160 miles, 15 miles northwest of Indianapolis, at 2005CST, when he saw an object about 600 to 700 above him on a circle of elevation. Object was moving Southeast to Northwest on a heading of approximately 310Q. Object was amazing in crowding fire. In about six seconds the object traveled in a 300 arc in front of the aircraft. The light then diminished, but a black object remained visible. Estimated altitude of the object 10,000 feet. (from Cincinnati AFB 2125CST)

e. Eastern Airlines Flight 177 (Pilot [name redacted]) was in the vicinity of Evansville, Indiana at 2005CST. Flight sighted an object at an estimated altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 feet. Object was very bright, and was off his right wing about 10 miles. Flight was headed in a Southeasterly direction, and the object was heading Northwesterly. Reported shape: Somewhat round. Pilot was not sure that it was not a meteor or falling star, since he has seen many of these in his years of flying. (from Aircraft DCQ, Cincinnati AFB 2125CST)

f. An amateur astronomer called St. Louis Naval Air Station and advised that he had sighted an object at an angle of elevation of about 300. A TDA Constellation, which was in the vicinity, tentatively confirmed the sighting. (from St. Louis, Missouri at 2125CST)

g. Captain [name redacted] saw a white object with a long white tail moving horizontally in a 1000 to 1500 feet altitude from Scott Air Force Base, Belleville, Illinois. He watched it for about 5 or 10 seconds. The light diminished, as is usual, of such objects. It did not appear to have a definite shape. (Report Officer in the Scott AFB tower said that the elevation appeared to be about 250 feet)

h. Lieutenant [name redacted], GCA Controller at Labert Field, St. Louis, Missouri, saw an object at 2103CST. It appeared like a comet (ball of fire), at about 10,000 feet.

1. The object, travelling horizontally, was sighted for about 10 or 15 seconds. It was located west, travelling and seemed to dim out and disappear. (Report received 211852Y)

2. The National Guard was having an open-air meeting at Peoria, Illinois, when they sighted what appeared to be two half oval or a wedge heading almost due west from Peoria tower 205000)

3. At approximately 201000Z, several members of the family in a rural area, located in a westerly direction, reported a ground to air visual sighting. The object passed very close to the Star tower (Reported in Chicago ARTC at 202033Z)

4. Mr. [redacted], a postal employee living at the corner of [redacted] saw what appeared to be a shooting star over a few hundred feet tall, travelling horizontally, headed southeast. Estimated position 205033Z, and was visible for ten seconds. Estimated altitude 11,000 feet. (Reported to Chicago ARTC at 202053Z)

2. Weather was reported as follows for the areas and times of sightings:

a. Indianapolis area - Sky clear, visibility more than 15 miles. Winds aloft from 110° at 20 knots.

b. St. Louis area - Sky clear, visibility 12 miles. Winds aloft from 150° at 15 knots.

c. Chicago area - Thin scattered clouds at 25,000 feet, visibility 15 miles. Winds aloft from 150° at 20 knots.

3. No meteorological or other activity which might explain the sightings is known. No physical evidence or two objects(s) has been reported. No aircraft or balloon identification has been reported in the general area at the time of any sightings, other than the aircraft involved.

Comments of the preparing Officer:

1. While all times were either reported in Central Standard Time, or converted to CST, it is believed this may underhandedly, as to obscure original report. While converted to Standard or Daylight-Saving Time, many exist. It is apparent that all sightings were approximately on the hour, either 2000ST or 2100ST. This difference, all reports may indicate sightings of the same object. This theory may be substantiated as follows:

a. All reports above indicate that the object was moving northwesterly (or in a northwesterly direction) with some slight variations. All reports originated in a North-northwest line, except for the St. Louis and Keokuk areas (Columbus, Indianapolis, Peoria, etc). Some reports indicate a change of bearing of 15° to 20°, or in the direction of Lamartine. When corresponding to the 15° of Lambert Field sighting, except 30° elevation, which corresponds to the 15° of Pekin, Illinois, the reports seem to indicate a similar direction.

b. Three of the reports (two of them by experienced pilots) indicate that the object was slowly moving for a reason. One of the reports appears to indicate a somewhat similar appearance, travelling approximately parallel to the surface.

c. Two reports appear to indicate that the object turned itself, this as appearing, while two reports indicate that he object merely travelled.

I was part of a group who were at the beach near Benton, Michigan around 2130 hours Saturday. Eight of us saw a bright light moving rapidly from East to West in the southern sky. This spot of light looked rather like the spot made by a search light much as used by searchlights when this light hit a low cloud. The path of this spot was nearly parallel to the horizon. After traveling roughly half way across the southern sky the light simply disappeared. There was some haze over the lake to the point that there was no definite outline to the spot and it probably appeared much larger than it actually was. I cannot say that its elevation above the horizon may have been - quite frankly the true horizon was obscured by haze, but I would estimate this at about 15 degrees.

At approximately 2015 hours, while in the vicinity of Chanute AFB, Illinois, attached was observed traveling towards the SE at altitude of 2000-
2000 feet. At a constant 270 knots, I observed a rocket like
ball of fire (with a short orange or red tail of flame) traveling
across the sky towards the SE. No noise was heard and
about 3-4 seconds, this place disappeared. There was no
other object in the sky at this time.

This observation was made at the near of Rantoul, Illinois.

At 2100 hours I went out of operations for a smoke and was sitting down, looking up at the stars, when all of a sudden a bright light appeared in a southwestern position of the sky. It appeared to go in a westerly direction at a great speed. I want to say if it disappeared or the light went out. I came into operations and informed the A.C. of the incident, and also checked with the tower and they had not seen it. In my opinion I can't say what it might have been except a space because the sky had little behind the object, and also the color of it, which was sort of orange around the outer surface and white in the center.

While flying westward (360 degrees) 25 minutes, west of Benton, Ill at 6000 feet, I observed at 9:05 hours, Dly. an object first presumed to be a "falling star". It traveled to my two approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. From the left to the right. It appeared to be traveling from 150 to 200 miles/hr. Its intense brilliance made me believe it was not a conventional or falling star. If so, it swayed as if over some air current or before.

Sirs:

No doubt the officials of Project Blue Book already have reports of an aerial object seen in the vicinity of Indianapolis, Ind. on the night of 12 July, 1952. My wife, my son, and I all saw the object and feel it is our duty to report as much. In view of the fact that we saw the object through the windshield of our car and it was at night, I know our senses of depth perception were not so good.

On the night of July 12, 1952, my family and I were attending a movie at the Greenwood Theater in Greenwood, Ind. At 2105 hours, we saw the object streak across the sky to the west of us and going in a north-westerly direction. It looked larger than the largest stars and two or three times brighter. It seemed round in shape. There appeared to be a very slight glowing tail or exhaust. It seemed to move in a straight line and at a constant altitude, moving the distance from I first observed it until I went out of sight in about four seconds. Its intensity seemed to fade as it moved further away. My estimation of speed and altitude are just poor guesses, but it seemed to me that it was at an altitude of from ten to twelve thousand feet and moving at least fifteen hundred miles per hour.

It is quite possible that this object was meteor or fireworks, but it is like none I have ever seen. I could hear no plane in the area at the time, neither could I hear any sound from the object. I hope this has already been explained, if not I hope you can explain it.

Respectfully

Arnold Mo. Aug.17, 1964

Project Blue Book Info. Officer
Pentagon, Wash. D.C.

My Dear Sir:
First let me thank you for sending me the bulletin on U.F.O.'s. --it is very interesting.

This letter is intended as a commentary on the accompanying notes and diagrams which (Ihope) are presented in such a manner as to be lucid and self explanatory.

I am 47 years old, male, and belong to no group engaged in promoting the "flying saucer" either commercially or otherwise.--my interest in this subject is purely objective. I feel it the duty of all of us to help and not hinder you Air Force gentlemen in your search for an answer to this perplexing and highly controversial subject.

Prior to the enclosed sightings, I had no preconceived notions on UFO's, although like millions of other people I was very much aware, due to the news media, of their existence.

The first sighting (Aug.28,1948) took place while my wife and myself were residing on a small farm in the vicinity of the hamlet of Beck,Mo. about 12 miles south of the city of St. Louis on U.S.highway 61.---- the second occurred in the same vicinity although we had, in the interim, sold our farm and moved to a new location about 2 miles removed.

In 1952 I submitted a report of the enclosed phenomenon to an organization in L.A. Cal. calling itself "Civilian saucer Investigations"----they acknowledged my communication and thanked me for same, but this has never satisfied me----I want to make sure that this information reposes in Air Force hands where it rightfully belongs. (I did not submit the July 12 '52 sighting to G.S.I., as I had not occurred at that time).Since the foregoing experiences, I have, I think quite naturally, been prompted to read everything of a reliable nature concerning U.F.O.'s that comes my way, and the following are a few personal conclusions I have drawn that you may (or may not) be interested in sharing.

A. It is my belief that so called "flying Saucer" and associated phenomena are not something that have made their advent in the last decade (more or less) but are, and have been, indigenous with man for an extended period of time.

B. I further believe that these "objects" are capable of materializing and dematerializing instantaneously and at will.

C. That, though they may be entirely capable of interplanetary flight, they are not necessarily "space ships".

over, please


- page 54 -

D. That, "...ough giving back radar reflections, they are not "solid" in the accepted sense, but are more in the nature of "living energy"

E. I will pause here while you finish laughing, although I am not intending any levity---

In conclusion let me say that I think that those "things" can have caused aircraft to crash. A commercial airliner, or any aircraft, is making its final approach---everything normal---flaps down, throttle back, (just routine procedure) suddenly dead ahead, closing on collision course, a "fiery object" ---Your reaction anyone reaction? ---jerk the nose up, or down,---hard over ---no time for any thing---no time for any thing---result? ---just another unfortunate and unaccountable aircraft disaster.

I hope I have not bored you too much, --

Sincerely and respectfully yours

P.S.
Would you be so kind as to let me know if you receive this report---I am not seeking any publicity, but I have put considerable effort into this writing and I would like to know that it got into the right hands. ---also, you may use this information as you may see fit.

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report having seen a "Flying Saucer". Let me say first that no-one could have been more skeptical than I about the existence of these objects. The circumstances were these.

I was on a vacation camp on a small lake called Rock Island Lake which is near Taweel Lake about eighty miles north of Kamloops, British Columbia. About three o'clock in the morning on Friday, July 11th I could not sleep so got up and went down to the lakeside. It was dark and I could just see the outline of trees against the sky. The sky was perfectly clear and the moon about half full and at a height of about forty degrees above the horizon.

Suddenly under the moon and at a height about halfway between the moon and the horizon my eyes caught this light, which traveled from east to west perfectly horizontally and was in slight four our seconds. I had no way to judge its distance so could not estimate size or speed except that it seemed very fast. Its apparent size was about twice the diameter of the moon. When it disappeared I cannot be sure whether it went behind the hills or whether its light went out, probably the former. Its size seems to me to have remained apparently the same during the time it was in sight.

Its appearance was as if it were made of clear plastic containing a brilliant white light. The main body was a disk the thickness of which was about one-sixth of its diameter. At the rear was a blunt rounded nose about the shape of the nose of a revolver bullet. There was no sound and no trail of exhaust or sparks. Below is a sketch of its appearance as well as I can draw it.

For two days afterward I tried to convince myself that this was a reflection or could be accounted for by some normal means but have been unable to do so. My thinking changed in four seconds from an attitude of almost complete disbelief to one of firm conviction that this thing exists and that I saw it.

Yours sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

Dear Sir:

I have filled out the questionnaire sent me on August 18th and am returning it herewith.

I am also enclosing a copy of my first letter reporting this sighting. After twelve years I have no reason to change any part of this letter except for two minor corrections which I have noted.

I still recall with amusement some carefully disguised questions in the original questionnaire which asked in effect if you had been drinking before the sighting. My reply was that I hadn't been drinking before, but that I sure went up to the cabin and took a good stiff one afterward.

I was considerably "shook up", and still am whenever I think about it.

My interest in this matter has not been renewed, and I will be glad to have any further information you may be able to give me.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,

In a recent newspaper article was a discussion of the research on the flying saucer, which stated that there are 910 unsolved cases. About twelve years ago I reported a sighting and I am of the opinion that mine is probably one of the 910.

I think I made one error in my report, believe I said the one "moving" was moving from east to west. I knew my directions better now, and it was moving from northeast to southeast, or possibly from NNE to SSE.

I still know that I saw something, and still haven't the slightest idea what it was. I have tried to convince myself that it was a reflection of car headlights on some layer in the atmosphere, but there is no road closer than four miles so this theory doesn't hold up.

My guess now is that it is some natural electrical phenomena which we know nothing about, possibly associated with superheated air.

I did not keep a copy of my report, would it be possible for me to get a copy of it and check it over?

Yours sincerely,
(s)

Dear Sir:

Referring to your letter of July 24th. The sighting of the "unidentified flying object" was on July 11th, 1952. My first letter was written July 23d, 1952. The letter sending me the questionnaire was dated August 20th, 1952, and the questionnaire was returned a few days later.

The location was at a lake (Rock Island Lake) about seventy miles north and a little west of Kamloops, British Columbia.

I hav e a fishing cabin on this lake and go there every year. It is interesting to me to realize that twelve years later I still haven't the slightest idea what it was.

Yours sincerely,

1. We are in receipt of two reports from Mr [redacted] in a
letter dated 17 August 1964.

2. The observation of 12 July 1952 did not contain the duration
of the sighting. It did indicate that the object was travelling
33 - 40 mph and was 10-15 feet long. No mention as to how the
speed and size was estimated is made. The object was at an
approximate altitude of 100 feet and only 200 feet from the witnesses. Its did not indicate the sound accompanied the motion
of the object. The description indicates a meteor or jet aircraft
with afterburner. However, both of these objects would be ruled
out due to the close proximity of the objects to the observer
and the slow speed of 35 - 40 mph.

3. It is suggested that an AFD Form 164 be forwarded to Mr Moore
should he desire an evaluation. We are unable to explain this
observation on the data presented.

4. Regarding the sighting of 28 August 1948 we are again at a
loss to offer any explanation. The object appeared below and
behind trees and a telephone pole. Its motion cannot be correlated
with conventional objects. The duration of the observation of
10 - 12 seconds and the speed of 10 - 12 mph seems inconsistent.
The description of this sighting contained the basic data required
for evaluation. We are unable to offer an explanation. Since the
sighting is sixteen years old it is not feasible to conduct an
investigation into the case. We should be given a note of
appreciation for reporting the observations to the Air Force.

2. The observation of 12 July 1952 did not contain the duration of the sightings. It did indicate that the object was traveling 3 - 4o high and was 10-15 feet long. No mention as to how the speed and size was calculated. Its usual approximate altitude of 100 feet and only 300 feet from the witness. No data could indicate that sound accompanied the motion of the object. The description indicates a motor or jet aircraft with afterburner. However, both of these objects could be pilot and the slow speed of 3 - 4 mph.

3. It is suggested that an AFD Form 164 be forwarded to Mr Moore should be desire an evaluation. We are unable to contain this observation on the data presented.

Perhaps you may think me guilty of excessive comment,but here is another thought that occurs to me in connection with this sighting--

This U.F.O. presented many of the aspects of a 2 dimensional "projection";---we are all familiar with the manner in which a deputy sitting a point reaches a point where it presents a "minimum silhouette";---after the U.F.O. made the 90 degree turn and proceeded east, it "went out like a light" at a point where it should have presented its "minimum silhouette".

It quite naturally follows that if it were 2 dimensional,it would show no silhouette.


- page 83 -

Aug. 28,1948 sighting.

Instantaneously and simultaneously with full 90 degree turn U.F.O. "dives" into 3 identical "spheres" being attached to one another by tenuous, all very string of light.

What I have not shown in diagram is at precise time of metamorphosis, "object" pivots on original "close" into new course and proceeding on new heading almost due East, and after proceeding App. 100 feet, just "goes out" like switching off a light.

The phenomenon was observed at very close range (never more than 60 to 70 ft.) in very minute detail, by Mr. _____ and Mrs. _____ on Aug. 28,1948 -----weather conditions at time, etc....

time-----8:30 P.M. (give or take a few minutes)
sky conditions.....beautiful summer evening, no clouds, no planes in vicinity.
no outside distraction to disturb or confuse observation-----absolutely no sound of any nature was audible in connection with this U.F.O.

app. duration of observation,-10-12 seconds.

I might add that there was no appreciable "wind" stirring at time and temp. was normal to vicinity at season of year.

(see other side)

Additional text on right side of document:
tall completely detached, solid 6½ very indecent white-----setting motion. U.F.O. first observed completely stationary.

original U.F.O. "globe" app. ten to twelve inch diameter. Presented only thin silvery "rim"outline not solid white-----evening sky visible thru center(same app. lies to more complex structure after metamorphosis.)

Path of original U.F.O.(great-flattened for reasons of space) travelled app.80-90 ft. to point of 90 degree turn, and at same speed app. 10-12 M.P.H. ---This "diagram" is presented from the perspective of observer looking almost directly "up" at U.F.O. at tree-top level, overhead.


- page 84 -

Here is the text from the document:

( How long original "glob U.F.O." had been adjacent to utility pole prior to discovery, I have no way of knowing,--upon discovery however, it re-mained stationary for a period of approx. 2 seconds before starting to move.

Also, after original "globe" divided into three, there seemed to be some diminution in size "globs" relative to parent sphere.

The scene of sighting is five eight of one mile off U.S. Highway 61, and was not subject to any traffic noises nor any form of distractions.

In both of these instances we observers were out-doors--back of house.

You may ask--"how do you know UFO was small and close up,--when it may have been large and far away?"

I have anticipated this and my answer is this---the clarity of fine detail;--the quivering, pulsating motion of the "ball"---the two top transformations. you may rest assured of its proximity.

I hope you do not find this redundant,--I am just endeavoring to be as complete in my report as is in keeping with the facts and nothing more.


- page 85 -

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I am well aware of the fact that the personal "opinions" and "theories" of observers of these various phenomena are neither solicited nor appreciated, but I feel it my duty to give my personal impressions of this "manifestation" -- to wit--

I had the distinct feeling that we, the viewers, were the objects of "observation", and not the other way around.

That this "object" was not "solid" in the accepted sense, I feel certain ----rather, it seemed to be living, sentient energy displaying intelligence and even (at least I seemed to sense) a wry sense of humor. ----If not to we yokels, why the blatant and open display complete with weird transfiguration? -- -I felt it was "laughing at us"

I have presented the facts in the foregoing to the best of my ability and with no exaggeration, and also with no deliberate intent to mislead or deceive.

We all know that the practice of deception and quackery is what makes the word of honest folks subject to doubt, so please accept this in the spirit with which it is submitted-----in the interest of scientific truth.

If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
It was about twice (or a little more) the apparent diameter of the moon. I considered this carefully at the time, as I realized I must report the sighting.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A simple oval/elliptical shape is drawn with an arrow indicating "direction of flight"]

No sound, exhaust or vapor trail.

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report having seen a "flying Saucer". Let me say first that no-one could have been more skeptical than I about the existence of these objects. The circumstances were these.

I was on a vacation camped on a small lake called Rock Island Lake which is near Travel Lake about eighty miles north of Kamloops, British Columbia. About three o'clock in the morning on Friday, July 11th I could not sleep so got up and went down to the lakeside. It was dark and I could just see the outline of trees against the sky. The sky was perfectly clear and the moon about half full and at a height of about forty degrees above the horizon.

Suddenly under the moon and at a height about halfway between the moon and the horizon my eyes caught this light, which traveled from east to west perfectly horizontally and was in sight for about four seconds. I had no way to judge its distance so could not estimate size except that it seemed very fast. Its apparent size was about twice the diameter of the moon. When it disappeared I cannot be sure whether it went behind the hills or whether its light went out, probably the former. Its size seems to me to have remained apparently the same during the time it was in sight.

Its appearance was as if it were made of clear plastic containing a brilliant white light. The main body was a disk the thickness of which was about one-sixth of its diameter. At the rear was a blunt rounded nose about the shape of the nose of a revolver bullet. There was no sound and no trail of exhaust or sparks. Below is a sketch of its appearance as well as I can draw it.

For two days afterward I tried to convince myself that this was a reflection or could be accounted for by some normal means but have been unable to do so. My thinking changed in four seconds from an attitude of almost complete disbelief to one of firm conviction that this almost exists and that I saw it.

Yours sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

Dear Sir:

I have filled out the questionaire sent me on August 18th and am returning it herewith.

I am also enclosing a copy of my first letter reporting this sighting. After twelve years I have no reason to change any part of this letter except for two minor corrections which I have noted.

I still recall with amusement some carefully disguised questions in the original questionaire which asked in effect if you had been drinking before the sighting. My reply was that I hadn't been drinking before, but that I sure went up to the cabin and took a good stiff one afterward.

I was considerably "shook up", and still am whenever I think about it.

My interest in this matter has now been renewed, and I will be glad to have any further information you may be able to give me.

Yours sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]
