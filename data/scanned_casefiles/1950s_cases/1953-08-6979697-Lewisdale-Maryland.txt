34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 Day 2 Month 1967 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting.

It might be good to mention that I remember that this was a very steady and near unmistakable that some concentration was required before I could see this as anything but a solid steady light. There was no flicker or any noticeable change in brightness that would indicate fluttering or flickering as of an aircraft light. The light almost seemed located or anchored to a point in space and did not wander around to any great extent. When it began to move it did so in a very steady manner and then vanished suddenly.

There was a small red light or what appeared as a red light located toward one side of the main light. This red light seemed to be much smaller and faint compared to the main light. At no time did the light give any indication of being connected to an aircraft or any type of vehicle. The shape was circular and perfectly steady, not fluttering or flickering in any manner. The color of the light was a very intense bright white or off white.

The size of the object seemed larger than a star and when viewed through binoculars the light seemed concentrated and solid with no scattering or halo type effect. This seemed to indicate that the light source was not too distant. It is difficult to estimate the size or distance but it was at least many times larger than a star and closer than normal aircraft would be flying.

The steady or anchored position of the light and the lack of any noticeable change seem to indicate that this was not an aircraft light, either commercial or military. The manner in which it suddenly vanished also seems to rule out any conventional explanation.

Dec. 6, 1954

Dear Sir:

I had read of a meteorite in Alabama so I have decided to write you about a sighting that occurred in our yard and back yard on the night of Nov. 23, 1954. We were asleep in bed when a bright light awakened us. We jumped up and went to the window to see what it was. We saw a round, glowing object hovering over the trees which I thought indicated great heat. There was no noise and no vapor trails as it hovered there. It remained there for about 5-10 minutes and then shot straight up and disappeared. It did not fall or descend but just shot up and was gone instantly. Rather these things deteriorate. I have them.

I have given many pieces away in an attempt to find out what they are and I succeed. However, I am standing firm to everyone over the fact that I still keep them and show them. I am a standup joke to everyone concerned.

I would dearly love to know if they really are meteorites and I think you would know. 

Thanking you kindly,
Mrs. -----

7 September 1953, Lewisdale, Maryland

On the nights of 30 Aug, 1 Sep, 2 Sep, 3 Sep, 4 Sep, 7 Sep, a Mrs. - reported something like an airplane's landing light, although no sound was seen. When the object moved off, it would disappear over the city of Washington, D.C. The light would alternately go bright and dim, over the city of Washington, D.C.. The light was observed by Mr. - and his family and found to be hovering over the area for about 30 minutes. There were 5 more witnesses to the sighting. Mrs. - mother and Mrs. - sister of Mrs. -, liability unknown.

Mrs. - lives in Lewisdale, Maryland. She has been trying to get confirmation from people in the community that Mrs. - saw what she reported. It is doubted as to what she actually saw. The preparing officer states that he is quite convinced that the light seen is nothing other than the landing light of a small plane.
