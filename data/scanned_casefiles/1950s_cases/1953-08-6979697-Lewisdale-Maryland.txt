"a flying saucer" We went back down to the camp site and changed clothes for a study meeting + the children could hardly settle down the rest of the day. I tried to explain what we saw to other adults + they couldn't seem to understand such a thing, or even imagine it - the hovering + disappearing part. Of course, all of us that saw it couldn't either [understand]

I remember looking down + seeing the light, but, by a patch that covered almost three of us. I noticed how bright it was very large.

Then children thought they saw figures moving us through the middle area of spacecraft. I think it was pure imagination. The hardest part to see, was the middle area. We argued whether it was windows, or metal or glass or a lens, etc.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

It might be good to mention that I remember this all very clearly & can remember the conversation the young people & I were on Riggs one of them said "Hey, Miss..." looks out there!" I turned around & we were all very impressed.

There was a small water lake behind us & we were sitting on the edge in swimming suits & talking about Hawaiian dancing & Hawaiian people. No one went in the water because it was too scummy or dirty or such.

The sun reflected on the craft at one point. The light almost blinded us for a point. It almost seemed found over a 6x4 area. Children argued it was a flying saucer. Some even a picture of one. It was a government aircraft & it could be a flying saucer because it doesn't look like one we were, but no one has ever said they saw.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

[Handwritten note: I don't understand what you mean with this long explanation]

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[Handwritten note: A wobbling motion, something in one place but real movement. I never saw. It was too fast.]

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?

Dear Sir:

I had read of a meteorite in Alabama so I have decided to write you about my rocks: They fell in our back yard last September 1953. The arch was scorched around them and a white fowler covered the rocks which I thought indicated great heat.

There is a terrible smell about them and they seem to eat through cloth or paper. Rather these things deteriorate. I have them in a can.

I have given many pieces away in an attempt to find out what they are and never succeeded. However, I decided they were meteorites and have kept them. I am a standing joke to everyone over the fact I still keep them and show them to anyone interested.

I would dearly love to know if they really are meteorites and I think you would know.

Thanking you kindly,
Mrs.
New Milford, Ohio

We are located on _______ 19 miles out of Akron, Ohio. My husband is employed as a linotype operator at the Akron Beacon Journal in Akron.
