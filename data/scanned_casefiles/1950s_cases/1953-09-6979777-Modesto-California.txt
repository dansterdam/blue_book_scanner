MODESTO, CALIFORNIA
3 SEPTEMBER 1953

A newspaper photographer and a news reporter, for the same paper, saw a yellowish white light at 7:45 p.m., PDT, 3 September 1953.

The light seemed to be about ten degrees above the horizon in the direction of the Modesto Airport. The witnesses said it appeared to remain stationary as they drove a distance of about one mile East where it vanished from view. They believed it to be an aircraft with landing light on flying the upwind leg at Modesto Airport.

The news photographer took his camera to the newspaper building and set it up on the roof in the direction he believed he had seen the light. He left his camera unattended with the shutter open for about four hours. He developed the film on 8 September 1953. When he noticed the elliptical light and could not explain it, he called Castle Air Force Base.

The exposure was made with a speed graphic camera, set on f22 and unattended except for opening and closing the shutter. The exposure was made sometime between 8:20 p.m. 3 September and 00:15 am, 4 September.

The camera was located about 40 feet above the street and oriented East.

The geographic location is 37.38N - 121.00W. The elliptical light is approximately at ten degree elevation and on a bearing of ninety degrees.

It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the elliptical light in the photograph is the flash of a landing light of an aircraft.

flying is the vicinity of Modesto Airport. Civil Defense ground observers on duty during the time exposure noted what they believed was a small aircraft with landing light on, flying the traffic pattern at Modesto Airport between 10:15 pm - 10:30 pm, PDT, 3 September 1953.

The conclusion is based on the statements of the observers and the coincidence of the northeast orientation of the runway and its location. The runway was 4½ NM from the observers and 2½ NM from the camera.

At the top of the page, there is some text that is partially illegible, but appears to start with "LINK" and includes some other words that are difficult to make out clearly.

The image is a map of the city of Turlock, showing a grid of streets and city blocks. Various street names and landmarks can be seen, but most are too small to read clearly at this resolution.

This image appears to be a map of Modesto, California and surrounding areas. The map shows a grid of streets, with some areas more densely populated than others. There are numbered columns on the left side of the image, which seem to be a legend or index. The map includes both urban and rural areas, with rivers or waterways visible as winding lines. The map is in black and white and appears to be from an older document, likely from the 1950s based on the filename.

The text on the left side of the image is partially legible, but due to the image quality, I cannot confidently transcribe all of it. The columns appear to contain lists of names or locations, but the text is too blurry to read with complete certainty.

Forward herewith is a photograph showing an elliptical shaped light. The photo was made at night from the top of a building in Modesto, California. The camera was oriented towards the East and was left unattended for four hours except for opening and closing the shutter. A civil defense ground observer crew noted an aircraft with a landing light on fly the traffic pattern at Modesto Airport several times during the interval that the exposure was made. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the elliptical light on the photo negative is the result of the flash of an aircraft landing light.

3. Comments of Preparing Officer: It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the elliptical light in the photograph is the flash of a landing light of an aircraft flying in the vicinity of Modesto Airport. This conclusion is based on statements of observers and the coincidence of the northwest orientation of the runway and its location. The runway was light from the observers and 2½M from the camera. See map, Enclosure 2.
