Just after dark a bright light appeared high in the western sky moving rapidly toward the east. It flashed on and off several times and had a pulsing effect. No sound was heard and the light disappeared from sight after about 2 minutes. Local radar operators stated no unidentified targets were observed on their scopes during the time the light was observed. The light was described as being brighter than a star and having a distinct reddish-orange color. Weather conditions were clear and visibility was good. The observers were two police officers on routine patrol.

The image contains a document that appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report. There is no photograph present in this image. The text below describes the incident that occurred on September 3, 1953 in Modesto, California, where a newspaper photographer and a news reporter witnessed a yellowish-white light in the sky around 7:45 p.m. The light seemed to be about one degree above the horizon in the direction of the Modesto Airport. The witnesses said the light remained stationary as they drove away, and they believed it to be an aircraft with landing lights on flying upwind. The photographer took his camera to the newspaper building and set it up on the roof to photograph the light, but it disappeared from view after about four hours. The report also mentions the exposure settings used and the opinion of the preparing officer that the elliptical light in the photograph is the flash of a landing light of an aircraft.

MODESTO, CALIFORNIA 
3 SEPTEMBER 1953

A newspaper photographer and a news reporter, for the same paper, saw a yellowish white light at 7:45 p.m., PDT, 3 September 1953. The light seemed to be about one degree above the horizon in the direction of the Modesto Airport. The witnesses said it appeared to remain stationary as they drove a distance of about one mile East where it vanished from view. They believed it to be an aircraft with landing lights on flying the upwind leg at Modesto Airport.

The news photographer took his camera to the newspaper building and set it up on the roof to photograph the light. He left his camera unattended with the shutter open for about four hours. He developed the film on 3 September 1953. When he noticed the elliptical light and could not explain it, he called Castle Air Force Base.

The exposure was made with a good graphic camera, set on f22 and unattended exposure for opening and closing the shutter. The exposure was made sometime between 9:20 p.m. 3 September and 00:15 a.m. 4 September. 

The camera was located about 40 feet above the street and oriented East. The geographic location is 37.38°N - 121.00°W. The elliptical light is approximately at ten degree elevation and on a bearing of ninety degrees.

It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the elliptical light in the photograph is the flash of a landing light of an aircraft.

The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing an observation of a small aircraft flying in the vicinity of the Modesto Airport on September 3, 1953. The text outlines the conclusions made by civil defense ground observers based on their statements and the location of the runway relative to the observers.

Flying in the vicinity of Modesto Airport. Civil Defense ground observers on duty during the time exposure noted what they believed was a small aircraft with landing light on, flying the traffic patterns at Modesto Airport between 10:15 pm - 10:30 pm, PDT, 3 September 1953.

The conclusion is based on the statements of the observers and the coincidence of the northeast orientation of the runway and its location. The runway was 4% NM from the observers and 2% NM from the camera.

1. The preparing officer in company with an OSI agent and a Castle AF Base PIO representative made an investigation concerning an unidentified elliptical shape sighted over Modesto, California on September 15, 1953 to view a photograph.

2. The reason for sending the picture was that Mr. *** Modesto Bee newspaper photographer, took pictures for the same paper on September 15, 1953. The light seemed to be about 10 degrees above the horizon in the direction of Modesto Airport. They said it appeared to be a red object with a tail, and that it remained stationary for about 10 minutes. Nevertheless, he took his camera to the newspaper building and his camera malfunctioned with the shutter open for about four hours. When he noticed the light on September 15, 1953, when the incident occurred, the shutter developed the film on 8 September 1953.

3. The following is a summary of the details surrounding the unexplained elliptical light on the sighting:

(1) Description: One elliptical shaped light in a nearly horizontal attitude.
(2) Time and date: Sometime between the hours of 2020 to 0015PDT, 15 September 1953.
(3) Manner of observation: Exposure was made with a Speed Graphic camera set on f22 and unattended except for opening and closing the shutter.
(4) Location of observer: The camera was located on top of the Modesto Bee Newspaper building and oriented south. The geographical location is 37o 39'N - 121o 00'W. The altitude of the camera was approximately 80 feet above street level.
(5) Identification of observer: There is no estimate of the reliability of the sighting since the observer was not available. Photograph is the only evidence.
(6) Weather and winds: The sky was clear, slight haze near the horizon, and winds 12 knots from 335 degrees.
(7) Evaluity of condition which account for sighting: See item (13).
(8) Typical sightings: Photograph made by Castle AFB Photo Lab from negative provided by Castle AFB.
(9) Evaluation: none.

(10) AF FORM 112 is an attachment. This form contained descriptors found common on Modesto airport between 2215 and 2250PDT, 15 September 1953 involving lights seen as flying the specific sighting pattern. However, these turned out to be a small aircraft with landing lights on flying a pattern at Modesto Airport.

The image contains a photograph showing an elliptical shaped light, which the report indicates was captured from the top of a building in Modesto, California. The report states that the camera was oriented towards the east and left unattended for four hours, except for opening and closing the shutter. A civil defense ground observer crew noted an increase in a blinking light on the traffic pattern for approximately 20 minutes. The report suggests that the elliptical light in the photo is the result of the flash of an aircraft landing light.

2. COMMENT? OF PREPARING OFFICERS: It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the irregular light in the photograph is the finish of a landing light of an aircraft. This conclusion is based on the observed characteristics and the reasonable explanation of the phenomena as observed at this location from the observers and seen from the camera.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing observations made by observers on duty at Modesto Airport regarding a small aircraft with a landing light on, flying the traffic pattern at the airport between 10:15 pm and 10:30 pm on 3 September 1953. The document concludes that the observation was based on the statements of the observers and the conditions of the sighting, and that the object was not photographed.

Flying in the vicinity of Modesto Airport, Civil Defense ground observers on duty during the same exposure noted what they believed was a small aircraft with landing light on, flying the traffic pattern at Modesto Airport between 10:15 pm - 10:30 pm, PDT, 3 September 1953.

The conclusion is based on the statements of the observers and the coincidence of the sighting. The object was not photographed.
