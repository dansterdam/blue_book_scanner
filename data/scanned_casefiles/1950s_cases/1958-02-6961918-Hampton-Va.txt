Statement concerning unexplained lights:

In the night of February 25, 1958, around 6:30 p.m., after darkness had started, I was walking west on Glebe Avenue in Hampton and I sighted what appeared to be a "formation of jets" flying about 150 above the horizon and to my right. There were a total of about 15 aircraft in this formation of jets with their lights shining. They passed from right to behind a house and I subconsciously listened for the sound. At this point, I would have expected to hear a normally fast speed for jets. Upon not hearing the sound, I assumed they were lights shining on some wires way up, as sometimes the reflection of lights moves very rapidly. So I dismissed it from my mind.

Later on, at approximately 9:00 o'clock that night, I was walking down Newport News Avenue, going in a westerly direction, and I noticed the moon in the sky was about a one-quarter moon and was rather hazy. As I was looking at the moon (mostly overhead) I spotted a V-formation of lights which I again took to be a group of jets flying about, I would estimate, twice the normal speed of jets and at about 3,000 feet. All this is my impression; I have no way of really knowing how high they were or how fast they were flying. The appearance was that of diffused lights, rather than point sources of light. They held a generally V-formation, they moved about very rapidly within that formation - not like a jet would fly along a very straight line. These lights, in plain, would normally follow high-speed jets, and there was no sound. These lights continued moving until they were about 45 above the horizon, and then passed across the sky in several areas. The lights were very distinct. Although I did not count the lights, the impression I got was of about seven lights, and they must have been in view from three to five seconds. I went out several times later on that night to try to get another view of them, but I did not see them again.

SUBJECT (Primary title for individual reports for separate subjects)
UFO Sighting, Hampton, Virginia, 25 February 1958

SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Begin narrative text on AF Form 112)

Two UFO sightings in Hampton, Virginia the night of 25 February 1958 were reported by Mr. William Donaldson, a civilian aeronautical research engineer, employed by NASA facilities at Langley AFB, Virginia. The first sighting was 1830 local (2330z). In this instance a series of lights were observed from V-formation at about a 450 angle above the horizon moving from south to north at an estimated 600 knots. The second sighting occurred within a few blocks of the first, approximately two hours and 30 minutes after the first sighting. In this case the lights were first observed when directly overhead, moving in a northwest direction. As in the first instance, the lights were in a V-formation. Because of the better vantage point in the second sighting, the observer was able to report that the lights emitted a rather diffused glow rather than a pinpoint or light sources and that the lights seemed to oscillate in the formation with relation to each other. Preliminary investigation by the originator of this report revealed nothing which would explain the above reported sightings. (See AF Form 112a attached)

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Hampton, Virginia, 25 February 1958

The following information is submitted in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 15, AFR 200-2. Information was obtained in that which was gained in an interview of the observer and additional information obtained from the Base Weather Station, the Langley Research Center, Hangar and Base Operations.

a. Description of the Objects:
(1) Shape: Circular sources of light.
(2) The size was estimated to be slightly smaller than a dime held in the hand at about arms length.
(3) Color was white tinged with yellow.
(4) Approximately seven light sources were observed.
(5) The lights were observed to be in a rough V formation of about 120° angle.
(6) No features or details were discernible.
(7) No tail, trail, or exhaust was observed.
(8) Observer reported no sound. He indicated he had specifically listened for this since he was sure that anything moving that fast would undoubtedly be a jet aircraft.

(9) The only unusual features of the sightings seemed to be the apparent speed which was estimated by the observer to be approximately 500 knots. This speed was based on the fact that aircraft at lower altitudes in this area are normally restricted to 300 knots and in both of these sightings the apparent speed was approximately twice the maximum normally observed. One observer stated that he was impressed by the individual observation regarding the second sighting in the formation. He further stated that this movement was quite rapid, but the total movement was less than the diameter of the light sources. This movement affected the individual light sources but the overall formation seemed to hold comparatively steady.

b. Description of Course of Objects:
(1) Attention of the observer was called to the objects by the movement of lights.
(2) When first observed on the first sighting, the lights appeared to be 20 to 45 degrees above the horizon. On the second sighting the lights were directly overhead when first observed.
(3) The lights in the first sighting appeared to maintain the same general small angle elevation during the sighting. When the lights disappeared they were at about a 10 degree angle above the horizon. The lights then traveled behind the landscape but simply disappeared from his view as though the lights had been turned off or angled from their previous course so rapidly that he missed the change in course.

(4) The flight path of the formation appeared strai ght during both observations. However, as indicated above, during the second observation, individual lights within the formation appeared to be moving with relation to the formation as a whole. In the first observation the formation moved in a northerly direction and in the second instance was moving to the northwest.

(5) In the case of the first sighting the formation disappeared from view behind a house. (See par b(3) above concerning second sighting.)

(6) Observer stated that the formation was in view for not over three seconds during the first sighting and in the second instance was observed for approximately three to five seconds.
