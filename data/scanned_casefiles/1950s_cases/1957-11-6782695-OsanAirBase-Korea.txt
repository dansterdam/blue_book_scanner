10. Olive (tower operator) reported a T-33 in area previously but is certain this is not what he saw.

11. [Redacted] Chief Radar Intelligence, 314th Air Division.

I feel certain these men saw an unusual object not of a conventional nature. There may be a possibility of a tie-in with an object sighted in Japan five days later, which was reported in the Pacific Stars and Stripes newspaper. These men were not available until a week after their sighting. But upon questioning, I ascertained that neither had read the newspaper article which might have colored their story somewhat. I have no substantive idea of the possible cause of the sighting.
