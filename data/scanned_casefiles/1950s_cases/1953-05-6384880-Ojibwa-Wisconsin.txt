11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
One large, oblong shaped black object broke up into four parts which continued on strait course in an E direction at an estimated speed of 120 MPH. This was from NW at 10 knots. Success was very telling. In rear at the 14 o'clock observation, therefore the estimation of speed, shape, and maneuvers may not be accurate. He description of the object sounds like a cloud.
