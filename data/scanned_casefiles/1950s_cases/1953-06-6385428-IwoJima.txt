Unidentified target appeared on FPS-20 A/c radar scope at 1330', 1340Z, 1350Z and was observed 15, 90, 15 seconds respectively. At time of the observation, slight scanner scatter was noted. The object was tracked to be traveling approx 500-600 mph. Radar of a nearby site stated that this pick up was not cross fixed from any net interference. This of w/o was a delayed plot at 30-40 knots, so no further information available.

SUMMARY (State within a summary of the report in not more than two lines)

1. In compliance with directive listed in reference section of this report, the following information is published:

a. At 14/112/2507N at 1302Z, the Radar Observer on aircraft #7282 observed an unidentified flying object at an approximate distance of 20 miles. Unidentified object approached from 7 o'clock position and closed to within 1 mile. KE-29 was at 10,100 'LPA, Reading 175 DEGREES, TAS 228 knots, weather clear. Unidentified object was 500 to 800 MH. No visual observation was made.

b. At 14/118/2452N at 1402Z an unidentified flying object was observed at a distance of approximately 6 miles ahead of KE-29 at a 1 o'clock position. KE-29 was at 10,100 FLPA, heading 152 degrees, TAS 228 knots, weather clear. Unidentified object was 500 MH. No visual observation was made.

c. At 14/118/2533N at 1502Z an unidentified flying object was observed at a distance of approximately 15 miles, on course from 6 o'clock and closing. KE-29 was at 10,100 FLPA, Heading 352 degrees, TAS 228 knots, weather clear. Unidentified object was 500 MH. No visual observation was made.

2. During the observations the unidentified flying object was either slightly higher or lower than KE-29. Unidentified object made no known breakaway but just disappeared. Radar Observer made a complete check for set interference, negative. No known aircraft were in the vicinity at the time of observations.

CONTENT BY PREPARING OFFICER: At time of second observation, Right Scanner said he observed 2 red lights and 1 white light vertically. These lights were believed to be from Iwo-Jima due to the nearness of the island at the time of observations. All observations were made in a radius of 8 to 45 miles from Iwo-Jima.

"HELL ROARER"

20 July 1953

During the last week, two articles in the Dayton papers and a phone call from Damon Runyonof the New York Journal American called Project Blue Book's attention to the "Hell Roarer".

As a result, WADC was contacted and the following additional information was obtained: This Project was started in October 1951 with one unit. Since that time, a second unit has been constructed.

At present there are two units in existence: one at W-PAFB that is operational and one in the ETO that is non-operational. The "Hell Roarer" is so-called for the tremendous amount of noise while in operation. It is loaded with 300 pounds of powdered magnesium. This will last for four full minutes if burned continuously. However, it can be used intermittently.

The "Hell Roarer" is similar to a conventional wing tank and is attached to the bomb shackles. There is an air scoop at the front end of the lower side of the tank that directs the flow of air through a tube on the underside of the tank. The powdered magnesium is fed into this tube and ignited at the rear by two "spark plugs". The "Hell Roarer" was used at various altitudes from 200'-3500'. For photographic use, it is most effective at low (200'-1000') altitudes. At any high altitude, it is useless for photographic purposes. As this magnesium burns it flickers causing a partially exposed film. Chief value of the "HR" at present is for night observation and air-rescue work.

Up to now the "HR" has been used on only one type a/c, the RB-26. Only one minor explosion has been encountered. Usual speed of a/c is 250 mph. The film "Inside WADC" (Uncl) shows the "HR" in action. This


- page 53 -

film will be obtained by Project Blue. The "RR" was used on the following dates:

Late Oct 51         Bradley Flds, Connecticut
Dec 51              Dayton, Ohio
Feb 52              Dayton, Ohio
Mar 52              Langley, Virginia
Mar 52              Operation "Longhorn", Texas
Jul 52              Island, Florida
Sep 52              Bradley Flds, Connecticut
Oct 52              Detroit, Michigan

The general opinion of the people who have seen this thing is "a burning aircraft". It emits a thick black cloud of smoke while in operation.

One A.O. actually dispatched a/c to search the area for a downed plane in one instance.

Usually the public is notified of tests in advance.

At the present, a new model is being constructed incorporating several improvements.

PIO INFORMATION:

15 Jul 53 Project Blue Book received a phone call from Damon Runyon, Jr., reporter for the New York Journal American. He stated that he had received some information concerning some new Air Force flare equipment which has a 1 million candle power light intensity and he is attempting to determine if there may be a correlation between this type of flare and the 19 Aug 52 Sonny DesVergers sighting.

Since Project Blue Book is not acquainted with this flare, Mr. Runyon asked for general information on Project Blue Book which was supplied by Lt. R. M. Olsson. His paper carried a story in late 1952 on the DesVergers sighting and this was a follow-up.

Project Blue Book will ask Hq ARDC about the subject flare, where it is being tested, its visibility capabilities, and, in general, about any tests regarding guided missiles, flares, and any other equipment which might have been responsible for a "flying saucer" report.

Seen Any Good Flying Saucers Lately?

The Air Force now is able to knock down "flying saucers" almost as fast as people think they see 'em.
Trouble is, people keep thinking they see 'em.
Results is the Air Force's "temporary" ghost-chasing project at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, is going on six years old and seems destined for a sort of semi-permanent status.
One sign of how it has settled is that it started in 1948 under a Lieutenant General and now is headed by a First Lieutenant.

LT. ROBERT M. OLSSON, of Gouldsbo, L. I., "temporarily" in charge of the staff of six, happily reported the project, now known as "Blue Book" for no particular reason, is about as even with the game as possible.

Last year the project received 1,760 reports of "flying saucers" and explained about 66 per cent. This year 117 about 90 per cent of 178 "saucers".

The big drop in "saucer" reports means people are thinking twice before fearing invasion from little green men from Mars every time they see a strange light overhead.

THREE REMAINING UNEXPLAINED:
at least 10 per cent, the main reason for continuing the project. Lt. Olsson explained:

"We don't want to get the possibility of something outside of our experience."

But he emphasized the Air Force is convinced "flying saucers" were not space ships full of crawling from some other planet.

THE AIR FORCE turned over

To the Old Folks Home:

Her Last Public Bow
LIVERPOOL, England, Aug. 1 (AP)—Elizabeth Stringer celebrated her 100th birthday in the dock at Magistrates Court on a charge of disorderly conduct. When the case was called, she said: "Get a gun and shoot me." But, after consultation with two women police officers, she yielded and said she would go.

THE AIR FORCE explanations range from weather balloons reflecting sunlight to weather conditions that produce mirage-like reflections.

Just recently the service revealed a secret gimmick that explained a few of the reports.

This was a giant magnetism flare giving off 10,000,000 candle power for night aerial photography. The device is attached to the wing of a big plane and presents an eerie sight in the sky.

Known as "The Hell Roarer," it has been tested mostly around Wright Field and Windsor Locks, Conn., so it could not explain most of the mysterious 10 per cent.

New Air Photograph
Device Described
The Air Research and Development Command at Baltimore, Md., Wednesday released details of the "hell roarer," a powerful new lighting device developed by the Wright Air Development Center here - and Wesleyan university at Middletown, Conn., for taking aerial photographs at night.

The "hell roarer" is contained in a torpedo-like 12-foot cylinder which attaches to the wing of a reconnaissance plane and can be controlled by the pilot. It gives in burns a finely pulverized magnesium powder.

The gadget gives off light of approximately 10,000,000 candle-power. (A 10-watt bulb gives about 52 candlepower.) The "hell roarer" can throw its intense light for more than four minutes, and the pilot can turn it off and on as required.

Because of the extremely high intensity of the "hell roarer" produces, it must be handled with extreme care. Built-in warning signals indicate if the device is not operating properly and the entire unit can be jettisoned if the plane is endangered.

DURING THE FIRST test flights conducted at Windsor - Locks, Conn., by researchers, nearby police and field officials were besieged with telephone calls reporting flying saucers or planes going down. In flames. An Air Force spokesman said the test was conducted at Dayton's East End.

The device now has been successfully tested on maneuvers, and the Air Force hopes it has solved an old military problem of how to take pictures of enemy activity at night from very low altitudes and at high speeds.

The idea for the "hell roarer" was conceived by the Air Force in 1949 and development work began the same year. The first flight test took place late in 1951.

NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE

Photograph released by the Air Force yesterday showing a B-26 bomber using a giant magnesium flare attached to the wing for night photography.

The Air Force Exposes a 'Flying Saucer'

WASHINGTON, July 15 (JP)—The Air Force announced today a powerful new flare for night photography and said the device has been responsible for some of the reports of flying saucers in the last two years. Police and field officials were besieged with phone calls reporting flying saucers or planes roaring down in flames when the 10 million-candle-power flare was first tested secretly in 1951 near Windsor Locks, Conn.

The Air Force said in a statement. A test near Detroit also brought numerous calls from excited observers. The Air Force said. Essentially the device is a giant magnesium flare, attached to the wing of a reconnaissance plane and controlled by the pilot. Its designers—a group of scientists and engineers at Western University, Middletown, Conn.—named it the "bell ringer" for the tremendous flood of sound emitted in the burning of finely pulverized magnesium powder at extremely high temperatures. The powder is contained in a tornado-like cylinder 12 feet long. The intense light will burn for more than four minutes, and the pilot can turn it on and off as needed. The first flight test model was designed and developed by Robert M. Dawson, a mechanical engineer, of Newington, Conn. The purpose is to make it possible to take pictures of enemy activity at night from very low altitudes and at high speed.

JOURNAL HERALD, DAYTON, OHIO, THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1953

ARDC Reveals
Photo Device;
Saucer Tip?

A "Hell Roarer" explanation for some flying saucer reports was included in an announcement yesterday by the Air Research and Development Command (ARDC) of a new device for taking aerial pictures.

The Wright Air Development Center is helping develop the "Hell Roarer" a wigging magnesium powder to provide an intense continuous light for night photography.

First test night at Windsor Locks, Conn., brought public reports of flying saucers or planes going down in flames. Similar reaction followed a test made in Detroit.

The mechanism, contained in a torpedo-like 12-inch cylinder, generates intense light of about 10,000,000 candle power for a few minutes.

Because of the energy involved in handling the magnesium, the entire mechanism is carefully shielded. If the plans is endangered, the "Hell Roarer" has been developed since 1948 to find a better way to answer to the problem of how to take pictures of enemy activity at night from high altitudes and at high speed. First flight tests were made late in 1951.

That Light In The Sky
Wasn't The Sun, Son

By BILL ANDERSON

A bright-looking object appeared over Dayton last night. Following is a handy little reference guide for readers in case it ever happens again:

If the object is extremely bright, and hot, there's a good chance it will be the sun. The sun stays out longer than usual. However, during the time of the sighting, the sun is usually down by 8:45 p.m., which rules out the possibility of the object seen last night being the sun. The object was seen at 8:45 p.m.

And to further rule out the object being the sun, the United States weather bureau reported in no uncertain terms that the sun went down yesterday at 7:04 p.m. It will not come back until approximately 6:17 a.m. today. Take our give a few minutes.

When it is definitely established that a bright object at night is not the sun, there may be a chance that it is the moon. There are several ways of looking at and for a moon. One way is to call up your girl (or boy) friend, borrow some money for gas and then go for a ride. Be sure and drive carefully, the safety division of the Chamber of Commerce recommends.

On cool nights it is advisable to have a heater in the car. When the moon, or the bright object, is finally located, study it for some time. While moons go fast, they don't look like they're going fast. From cars, moons, too, have different shapes varying from round to half round. Half round moons are called half-moons.

Sometimes there is no moon at all. (Actually, this isn't so. It's still there, you just can't see it.)

If there is no moon showing (there was last night, but a Journal Herald report taken from authoritative sources, indicated it was hazy), see if the object looks like a flying saucer. If it doesn't look like a saucer, but appears to be bright—and slow moving, smile.

The odds are 1000 that the object is a bright light on the belly of a Wright Air Development Center plane used to take night-time pictures. At least that was the case last night.

People in parked cars should remember this.
