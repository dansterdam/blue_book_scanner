MEMO-ROUTING SLIP

1. UFO correspondence for general public.

2. Comments upon which to base reply:
   a. As may be confirmed by astronomical tables in astro charts, the star ARCTURUS, now very bright in the heavens was in almost the precise location given by sources, at the times and place reported. Within two hours it had moved considerably towards the Western horizon.

   b. Repeatedly proven that any star and planet viewed through any hand-held telescope often produces some unusual appearances.

   c. Although object in sight for almost one-half hour no report of any UFO or anything unusual from military and civil aircraft, radar units or others in the area.

   d. Report appreciated. Although not conclusively identified, will be used as part of AF continuous analysis of UFO phenomena.

7120657 Jul

Norfolk 5, Virginia
July 2, 1958

Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs,

I would like to report an unidentified flying object. Yesterday, July 1, 1958, while I was working in my garden, my next-door neighbor, pointed it out to me. This was at about 7:20 P.M. (E.S.T.). It was almost directly overhead but a little to the west. It looked at first like a bright star but was more clearly defined and, when watched closely, was seen to move very slowly to the west.

I ran into the house to get a small, homemade telescope and at the same time called my father out. He saw the object through a pair of 3 power binoculars. My mother and sister came out too. By about 7:25 three more neighbors had come over and they all saw the object.

We watched the object for about 25 minutes, until 7:49 P.M., with the naked eye and with the binoculars nothing much could be seen. Through the telescope, a distinct outline was visible. It was perfectly round, with a bright metallic glint in the center and dark outer edges. The object continued, slowly, westward until 7:49 when it shot off so fast that it just "blurred" out of view.

The sky was clear, with a slight breeze. The sun had gone down but it was still daylight. When the object was first sighted there were no stars but after it left there were a few beginning to come out. It was fairly warm. The object was brighter than the sky, there was no sound, and no vapor trails.

We called the weather bureau and asked if they had a weather balloon up. They said they did but that it was to the east of us, so it wasn't a weather balloon. We called the paper but no other reports had been received. We did not tell them of our report.

The people who saw the object were:
