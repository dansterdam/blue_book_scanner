PREFACE:

1. Investigation was initiated by the District Commander, District Office 13, on 28 February 1951 and is predicated on information from 1st Lt. J. R. FITCH, A-20790A, Assistant Intelligence Officer, 11th Air Division, that an airman, S.Sgt. [redacted] had reported sighting an unidentified unusual object on 26 February 1951.

2. FACTS AND FINDINGS, ALASKA

2. On 26 February 1951 1st [redacted], 5024th Air Force Group, was interviewed. S/Sgt stated that he was placed on guard duty at building 135 at 1800 hours on 26 February 1951. At approximately 1700 hours he was at the post at the south end of the building, and he observed a large bird, probably a raven, which flew up into the air. As he watched its flight he observed an object in the sky, which at first he thought to be a weather balloon. Upon closer observation, the object was at an altitude of about 1,500 feet and almost directly over the last 135 runway. In order to observe it he had to look at 90 degrees vertically at an angle of approximately 70°. This object, which appeared gray, was shaped like a flattened football, having no sharp edges. He started that there was not sufficient light to determine its exact nature. While in this position at 18,000 feet, he believed the dimensions to be 10 to 12 feet wide and about 120 feet across. Then first observed it was hovering over the ground, possibly on a table. It remained in this position for about 1/2 second. Then the object entered a single area of space which formed a ring and descended rapidly toward the ground as a jet aircraft. S/Sgt attempted to watch its flight of the object but lost it as it passed toward the general direction of 3 feet Hill (north). The object was only a momentary effect on cloud formations and no sound or odor detected. The object was at such a distance that it could not determine any structural details.

3. According to the 6321 AACS Squadron, Ladd AFB, there were no reported radar echoes on 26 February 1951 between 1505 and 1737.

Investigation initiated 28 February 1951 predicated on information from 1st Lt. Jesse J. FULLER, A-20297OL, Intelligence Officer, 114th Air Division, that a [redacted] of 500lst Air Group, had sighted an unusual unidentified object on 26 February 1951.

Investigation disclosed that SELLS, while on guard duty at 1710½ hours, 26 February 1951, allegedly sighted a gray object hovering over the Ladd runway at an altitude of 18,000 feet. The object, 10 to 12 feet thick and 120 feet across and resembling a flattened football, remained in this position about 45 seconds and then moved with great speed to the north after emitting a single white smoke ring. Object was not reported by any other person.

There were no weather observation balloons or aircraft in the area at that time. No project work was being conducted by Cold Weather Test, Arctic Test Branch or the Geographical Institute. No test firing was to be done by units at Eielson AFB, Ladd AFB or Big Delta Army Base.

Laid AFB reported no project work. Lt. FULLER reported he had been unable to secure any information concerning the sighting made by Sgt. SMITH.

2. The Geophysical Laboratory at the University of Alaska, College, Alaska, was contacted on 2 March 1951. The Laboratory had not been conducting any project work which had a bearing on the unidentified object reported by Sgt. SMITH.

3. The Weather Bureau at Nome, Fairbanks, was again contacted on 5 March 1951. The Weather Bureau reported that no stations 200 to 300' from Fairbanks closer than 50 miles released meteorological balloons. This season is approximately 20 miles from Fairbanks.
