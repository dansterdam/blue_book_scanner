Request for UFO Evaluation, [redacted]                    21 Apr 65

Hq USAF SAFOI-CC (New Bunt)
Wash D C  20330

1. Reference the attached letter from [redacted]. The photo analysis division at Wright-Patterson AFB has studied the photographs and they have determined that the "reflected light intensity from the object suggests a location slightly in front of the illuminating source. Resolution and degree of image quality of the object falls between the front tele-graph pole and back telegraph pole. Estimating the cross arms of the telegraph poles to be five feet in length the object would be approximately three feet in diameter. From the above evaluation and associated imagery, the object appears to be a sphere suspended in air such as a gas-filled balloon.'

2. If Mr [redacted] desires to see a copy of AFR 200-2, he can do so the next time he's in Washington by dropping into SAFOI-CC.

3. The information contained in PTO Form 164 is the information used by Project Blue Book in analyzing and evaluating UFO sightings.

4. Every year, the Air Force receives thousands of letters from students requesting information on UFOs for term themes and term projects. B J Ruppelt's book has been out of print for many years and is not readily available in school and public libraries. We list only a few books which are available on Aerial and Cosmic Phenomena. We do this to help the students get started in their research.

5. Attached is his photograph. Please thank Mr [redacted] for letting the Air Force evaluate his photograph.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: Intelligence Directorate, Hq AAC                 Report No. IR-9-52         Page 2 of 3

During the month of July on three (3) different occasions, pilots and radar observers of the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, reported unusual radar returns obtained with the AF0-33 airborne radars installed in the F-94 type aircraft.

5 July 1952, F-94, 50937, Pilot: Jet Lt Thomas G. Heine (F-6), Radar Observer: 1st Lt. John D. Kelley (F-2):

At approximately 0322 in the Redoubt Bay area, 60°12' N 151°13' W, while at 5,000 feet, initial contact was made by radar contact. From initial contact into 6,000 yards, the target has no apparent forward speed but did appear to shift from side to side. At 5,000 yards the target appeared to climb with tremendous speed and was lost. A search was conducted in the area and contact re-established about six (6) minutes later at 13,500 yards with the same results. At no time was visual sighting made.

The weather was: overcast at 6,000 feet; tops at 7,000 feet; visibility good with no precipitation. Moisture content of the clouds was believed too low to give radar return on AF0-33.

The radar set in use was not operating at good efficiency with the short range almost inoperative. (Radar Observer's comment)


- page 6 -

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. Since three (3) different Radar Observers and see (3) different APG-33 radar sets were concerned in these radar contacts, it is thought unlikely that radar malfunction could be the cause.

2. Since the visibility at flight altitude in each incident was good, it is felt that had the radar return been caused by a material object, visual sighting would have been accomplished.

3. In view of paragraphs one (1) and two (2) above, it is believed that the radar returns were caused by some atmospheric condition or phenomenon which might be peculiar to Alaska only or to Alaska and the Northeast Command.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (Blank)                                                REPORT NO.
Intelligence Directorates, Hq AAC                            IR-9-52        PAGE 2 OF 3

During the month of July on three (3) different occasions, pilots and radar observers of the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, reported unusual radar returns obtained with the APS-33 airborne radars installed in the F-94 type aircraft.

5 July 1952, F-94, 50927, Pilot: 1st Lt. John D. Kelley (B-6), Radar Observer: 1st Lt. Thomas G. Heine (B-6)

At approximately 0322Z in the Redoubt Bay area, 60°42' N 151°43' W, while at 5,000 feet, initial contact was made at 20,000 yards. From initial contact into 6,000 yards, the target had no apparent forward speed but appeared to slide to side with tremendous speed and was lost. A search was conducted in the area and contact re-established about six (6) minutes later at 12,000 yards with the same results. At no time was visual sighting.

The weather was: overcast at 6,000 feet tops at 7,000 feet, visibility good with no precipitation. No known content of the clouds was believed too low to drive radar return on APS-33.

The radar set in use was not operating at good efficiency with the short range almost inoperative. (Radar Observer's comment)

21 July 1952, F-94, 50946, Pilot: Capt. Henry S. Anthony, Jr. (B-2), Radar Observer: 1st Lt. John W. Larkins (B-2)

At 2102Z in the Beluga Lake area, 61°25' N 151°35'W, while at 18,000 feet, first contact was made at 15,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished at 12,000 yards and an intercept started. Target was level with the aircraft's speed greater than 100 knots to 5,000 yards. At this point the target disappeared and contact could not be re-established. Pilot did not make visual sighting.


- page 10 -

At 20127 another attempt was made to contact the target observed earlier. While at 16,000 feet, contact was made at 12,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished and target overtaken at 50-60 knots. At 1500 yards, set action resembled normal break-lock and target was lost due to an abrupt upward action as seen in pilot's scope. Contact was re-established at 5,000 yards and followed to 7CC yards where aircraft speed appeared the same - 300 knots. Intercept was continued to 400 yards at which time the target moved out rapidly to 3200 yards where speeds were again synchronized with the target moving down. Pilot nosed the aircraft down and as the speed increased to approximately 400 knots, the target was overtaken to 1500 yards. At this time the radar broke lock due to a rapid downward movement of the target. Contact could not be re-established. Again, no visual sighting was accomplished.

During this incident, the weather was exceptionally clear with practically a cloudless sky.

25 July 1952, F-94, 50923, Pilot 1st Lt. Clyde M. Jones (F-2), Radar Observer:

At 08207 in the area Southeast of Talkessin, 62°10' N 119°00' W, at 11,500 feet, contact was made on a target which appeared larger than as seen on previous contacts. Lock-on was accomplished at this time with a target speed of 40 knots greater than that of the aircraft. Aircraft speed was increased to 350 knots in a 4,200 feet per minute climb. The target was still pulling away at over 100 knots. After a climb.

to 13,500 feet, the target appeared to level off and increase speed. Chase was broken off at this time. Visual sighting was not accomplished.

Weather was: estimated 14,000 feet broken; estimated 25,000 feet overcast with a visibility of 15 miles plus.

A further comment by the Commanding Officer of the Squadron to which the three (3) F-94's are assigned is that "no defects were found in the radar sets aboard any of the three (3) aircraft involved in these reports of unusual radar contacts".

A check of the records in the DOC shows no target returns that could be connected in any way with those obtained by the F-G-32.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. Since these (3) different Radar Observers and these (3) different F-G-32 radar sets were concerned in these radar contacts, it is thought unlikely that radar malfunction could be the cause.

2. Since the visibility at flight altitude in each incident was good, it is felt that the radar return mean caused by a material object, visual sighting would have been accomplished.

3. In view of paragraphs one (1) and two (2) above, it is believed that the radar returns were caused by some atmospheric condition or phenomenon not peculiar to Alaska only or to Alaska and the Northeast Command.

I, Thomas G. Heine, 1st Lt., AO 707869, assigned to the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, as a fighter pilot.

At 0517 5 July 1952 I was scrambled by GCI. I was vectored to Redoubt Bay. At 5,500 feet when I was approximately 5 miles north of Redoubt Bay at 0330, my Radar Observer, the Kelly, intercepted no he had a target on hand control. Prior to this GCI told me he had lost his target.

Then the Radar Observer switched to short range search he lost contact. GCI then instructed and intercepted a search in the area. A turn was made to 030° and I proceeded to climb above the overcast to 7,000 feet, after three minutes I once again turned a heading of 125° and was back down through the overcast to 6,000 feet. The same sequence occurred. At no time did I sight a target.

I, Claine M. Jones, 1st Lt, AO 779830, assigned to the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, as a Fighter Pilot.

At approximately 250302Z Jul 52, I was number two man in a flight of two (2) F-94B's. We were in the area of Talkeetna conducting a radar search for our target ship at approximately angles 11,500. The Radar Observer called out, "Gentle Port."

I immediately made a gentle port turn and there upon the 50 called a target at 14,000 yards - climbing. He asked for 100 and to climb, and very shortly the FO made for small climb and we were climbing at 350 knots and 4,200 feet per minute. At this time the target was 30° above us and leaving us. It also indicated a climb at over 100 knots. The target then appeared to level off and also increased its speed. The chase was broken off at that time and our angles was about 18,500. We were in aircraft #50728 and the target painted a very clear picture on the scope. The pictures indicated a larger type object than the F-94B which we had been using as the target.

At no time was there a visual contact made with the unknown object.

The foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge.

I, Henry S. Anthony Jr., Captain, AO 2079881, assigned to the 64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, am a fighter pilot.

On 21 July 1952 while over the Beluga Lake area at approximately 18,000 feet, an unusual radar contact was made by aircraft number 5094S with the AFD 33 radar equipment aboard. The first unidentified target was picked up at 18,000 feet and in a heading of approximately 060°. A look-on was made at 12,000 yards and the range decreased at over 100 knots to 6,000 yards where the set broke lock and the target was lost at approximately 12,120.

The second similar target was picked up at 22187 in the same area at 16,000 feet on a heading of 028°. Initial contact was made at 12,000 yards with the target slightly port. This range was steadily decreased at the rate of 50 knots to approximately 1,500 yards where the target was lost after an abrupt upward move in scene on the pilot's scope.

Immediately after losing this second target, a 360° turn was made and another contact was made at 6,000 yards. In intercept was attempted and the target was held 10° port and level while range was decreased to 500 yards at the rate of 50 to 60 knots. At that range the speeds were synchronized and an approximate 200 knots and the pilot made a slight turn to center the target on the pilot's scope. The range then decreased very slowly to approximately 400 yards, held steady for three to six seconds, and then began to move away again. At 3,200 yards the speed again increased, no change was observed but the target began to move downward. The aircraft was mosed down in an attempt to follow and as the airspeed decreased to approximately 100 knots, the range again decreased to 1,500 yards. As the downward motion increased and the target was lost from the bottom of the scope.

At no time was the target sighted visually by the crew, although visibility was unlimited. Aircraft in formation with 5094S did not pick up these targets.

STATEMENT

I, John D. Kelly, 1st Lt., AO 696530, assigned to the 64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, as a Radar Observer.

At 0317½ 5 July 1952 I was scrambled by GCI on a mission fulfilling the duties of Radar Observer. A radar contact was made with the APS 33 at G3322 on a target previously contacted by GCI.

The target was contested at 20,000 yards and was held in hand control to a range of 5,500 yards for approximately six minutes.

The target was held at all times approximately five degrees above our line of flight. The only apparent speed was that of the intercepting craft. However, the target was observed to move as if a light starboard to port orbit. The interception resulted in the range had decreased to 6,000 yards. When this range was reached the target appeared to climb at a tremendous speed. This change on my rapid then all could be was felt. On my hand control, I attempted to pick up the target on a short range during this unusual change but could not get an indication. No proceeded on course for approximately one minute then made a 160° climb through a very light overcast and proceeded to search. No proceeded on an apparently reciprocal heading for five to six minutes then made a 180° turn. Another contact was at 16,000 yards but the interception was the same as the first one.

The radar set, APS 33, was not operating at good efficiency. The pick up on short range was restricted to the approximately ten nautical miles. Only occasionally at the times, appeared at a normal relatively cycling. The gain resulted normally.

The area weather consisted of a very light overcast at approximately 6,000 feet and no more than 1,000 feet thick. No water and land area was observed for possible targets but none were discerned.

STATEMENT

I, John T. Lardas, 1st Lt., AO 663284, assigned to the 56th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, as a Radar Observer.

At 2120z 21 July 1952, while on a routine radar summary mission, radar contact was made with the UFO 33 on an unidentified target at 13,000 yards.

The target was located at 12,000 yards and as the pilot could not yet obtain a visual, an aircraft was afterward carried was held level and 10° bank with an over taking speed greater than 100 knots to a range of 5,000 yards. As the pilot could not yet get a visual, I broke lock to see what the target would look like on the scope. The slip, disappeared and contact could not be re-established, at the time of this first contact we were flying in a north-westerly direction at an altitude of 15,000 feet.

After firing out on the gunnery mission, the pilot suggested we attempt to pick up the target again. To headed in an easterly direction in the same general area and same radar scope area as 12,200 yards. The time was 2213; and the altitude 16,000 feet. A lock-on was obtained immediately and another intercept attempted. Target was held 10° port, 35° above with an overtaking speed of 10 to 50 knots (after reading) and was brought in a range of 1,500 yards at which time set action resembled a normal break lock.

A 360° turn was made and again contact was made at 5,000 yards. Another intercept was attempted. Target was held 10° port and level and was brought in to a range of 700 yards with speed of target and fighter aircraft the same. Pilot fired his guns and saw target as the dead ahead and level position, range 1400 yards at which time target moved very rapidly to a range of 3,500 yards. The lock-on was not broken at this time but as target was being tracked, again, set break lock at 1,500 yards as target moved down very rapidly, and remained so.

The radar set in this ship could be classed as excellent and both pilot and radar observer agree upon an excellent reading.

The weather was exceptionally clear with a practically cloudless sky.

At no time did pilots obtain visual contact with any object.

STATEMENT

I, Aubrey M. Brenner, 2nd Lt., 10 2223070, assigned to the 66th
Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base,
Alaska, am a Radar Observer.

While flying on a routine mission in a F-94B type aircraft
(#5726), an unidentified object was sighted on radar in our ships.
We were about fifteen (15) miles southeast of Talkeetna, Alaska,
when this object was first sighted. It appeared as a rod return
on the scope. The range was 1 little under 10,000 yards. A scale
port turn brought it over to 20°position, i.e., on the scope.
A lock-on was obtained. Previous to this it had been impossible
to lock-on to another F-94B at that range. The set indicated that
the target had a speed advantage of about 40 knots. It Jones, the
pilot, gave the ship 100% RPM and the speed of the target increased
also to 50 knots overtakes. From the original angle of 15° cleared
it began to increase to 20°. Maximum climb at the rate of 4,200 feet
per minute failed to catch the climb. The target appeared to level
off at 35° in elevation and the speed picked up from a 100 knots.
At this time we were at approximately 17,000 feet. Lt. Jones, the pilot,
had me on the pilot scope during the attempted interception. At the
end of approximately three (3) minutes the object was last seen as
a little over 15,000 yards and 30° of elevation. The target's estimated
speed was over a hundred knots greater than our own speed.

At no time did we have a speed or climb advantage.

Also, at no time was there a visual contact made with the unknown bogey.

The foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 640-62

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: New York, New York

DATE OF REPORT 9 September 1964
DATE 23 July 1952

PHOTOGRAPHY
QUALITY Fair

1. PURPOSE: This photo analysis report is in answer to HQ #64-62 submitted by Sergeant D. N. Moody, USAF. The image as viewed in the upper right quadrant of the photo appears to be a bright hemispherical object. However, the overall reflective characteristics imply that the object is probably metallic.

2. ANALYSIS: Reflected light intensity from the object suggests a close proximity to the central location. Light analysis and reflected light distribution creates a location slightly in front of the illuminating source. Resolution and degree of image acuity of the object was between the front telegraph poles and back telephone poles implying a position somewhere between the two telegraph poles. Estimating the cross area of the telegraph poles to be approximately 3 feet in diameter.

3. From the above evaluation and associated imagery the object appears to have a terrestrial source and is a sphere suspended in air such as a gas-filled balloon.
