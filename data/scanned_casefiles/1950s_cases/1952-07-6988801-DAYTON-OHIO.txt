During the month of July on three (3) different occasions, pilots and radar observers of the 666th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, reported unusual radar returns obtained with the AF-33 airborne radars installed in their F-94 aircraft.

5 July 1952 - F-94, 52937, pilot: 1st Lt. Thomas G. Harns (R-6), Radar Observer: 1st Lt. John F. Winn (R-6)
At approximately 0332Z in the Redoubt Bay Area, 60°42'N 151°43'W, while at 6,000 feet, initial contact was made at 20,000 yards from initial contact into 6,000 yards. This contact appeared to climb at 1,000 yards per minute to 16,000 feet and was lost. A search was conducted in the area and contact re-established about 15 (6) minutes later at 15,200 yards with the same results. At no time was visual sighting made.

The weather was overcast at 6,000 feet, tops at 7,000 feet; visibility good with no precipitation. The altitude conditions of the clouds was believed too low to give reflections.

The radar set in use was not operating at good efficiency with the short range almost inoperative. (Radar Observer's comment)

- page 6 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report related to Project Blue Book, discussing radar observations and possible causes for radar malfunctions or anomalies.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. Since three (3) different Radar Observers and three (3) different APC-33 radar sets were involved in these radar contacts, it is thought unlikely that radar malfunction could be the cause.

2. Since the visibility at flight altitude in each incident was good, it is felt that the radar return had been caused by a material object, visual sighting would have been accomplished.

3. In view of paragraphs one (1) and two (2) above, it is believed that the radar returns were caused by some atmospheric condition or phenomenon which might be peculiar to Alaska only, or to Alaska and the Northeastern Command.

PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

During the month of July on three (3) different occasions, pilots and radar observers of the 666th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, reported unusual radar returns contained in the F-94 type aircraft.
Ie Lt Conn D. Kelly (2-0), Radar Observer:

At approximately 07:32 in the Kodiak Sea area, 57°49'N, 152°13'W, while at 5,000 feet altitude, contacted an object moving at approximately 20,000 mph for a period of 4-5 minutes. The object appeared to change course and speed, and at one time seemed to be maneuvering a circling pattern and then accelerate again. After about 4-5 minutes, the radar contact was lost. At no time was visual contact established.

The weather was overcast at 6,000 feet, with tops at 7,000 feet. Visibility good, but the base of the clouds was believed too low to have given a radar return.

The radar set in use was not operating satisfactorily, and "appeared to be erratic" with the scope presentation.

21 July 1952, F-94, 99946, pilot: Capt Norr J. Anthon, Jr., (0-2), Radar Observer:
At 21:32Z in the Selby Lake area, 61°25'1"N, 151°35'W, while at 13,000 feet, a radar contact was made at 16,000 yards. The radar contact was accomplished in 3-4 seconds, and the target was "locked on". It then disappeared from the radar scope. The pilot did not make visual contact, and the radar contact could not be re-established.

At 0252Z in the area Southeast of Talkeetna, 62°10' N 149°,01' W, at 11,500 feet, greatest contact was made on a target which appeared larger than 4 to 5 feet in diameter. The target was illuminated in the light of full moon and visually observed to be 220 knots. The target climbed. The target appeared at 300 knots, interception was continued to go towards the target. The target moved at 300 knots was slowed down to 220 knots. Pilot closed in on the target moving down and as he approached to 1,500 feet, the radar broke the lock and target faded from the scope. Pilot opened throttle for a rapid run-in but target disappeared. The incident was occurred.

During this incident, the weather was exceptionally clear with practically no clouds.

AT 0025 ON 21 JULY 1952 I WAS FLYING AN F-94 JET INTERCEPT OF AN UNKNOWN OBJECT, WHEN I SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT APPROACHING ME AT 2,900 FEET WHEN I WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES NORTH OF KODIAK. IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN DIAMETER AND AS I CLOSED ON IT, IT ACCELERATED AND STREAKED OUT OF SIGHT IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AT APPROXIMATELY 0230. MY RADAR OPERATOR LT. KELLY, LATER TOLD ME HE HAD A STRONG ON HAND CONTINUOUSLY WHICH HE HAD LOST JUST PRIOR TO MY VISUAL SIGHTING. WHEN THE RADAR OBSERVER WATCHED THE SHORT RANGE SEARCH IN OPERATION, IT WENT OFF THE SCOPE AT THE SAME TIME I SAW THE BRIGHT LIGHT ABOVE THE OVERCAST TO 7,000 FEET. AFTER 3 MINUTES, I ONCE AGAIN PICKED IT UP BUT BY THEN IT HAD SLOWED TO 6,000 FEET. THE SAME SEQUENCE OCCURRED. AT NO TIME X SIGHT A NORMAL X-CRAFT.

I. Claine M. Jones, 1st Lt., AC 779830, assigned to the 56th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Kinderhoff Air Force Base, at approximately 2508207 Jul 52, I was number two man in a flight of two (2) F-94A-1 aircraft. We were in the air on a routine radar search from our target of approximately angles 11,500'. The target appeared to be metallic. 

I immediately made a gentle port turn and there upon the AO scope appeared a brilliant white dot of light. He gained for 1257 and to skim. And very shortly the FO asked for another pass. I made a turn and as I was approaching again, the target now appeared as 250 knots and approximately 3,000 feet. As I fired my bursts from my guns, I could see tracers going through but no damage indicated. At this time the target was flying above us and gaining us fast. Our angles was about 13,500'. We were in pursuit of the object which appeared larger than the F-94B which we had been using as the target.  

At no time was there a visual contact made with the unknown bodies. 

The foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge.

STATEMENT

1. Henry S. Anthony Jr., Captain, AO 207992, assigned to the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Ladd AFB, Fairbanks, Alaska, am a fighter pilot.

On 21 July 1952 while over the Bering Sea, at approximately 39,000 feet, I was engaged in a routine instrument training flight. At approximately 1300 hours I picked up a radar target 18,000 yards to the rear. This target was closing in at a rapidly increasing rate, and reached a position of approximately 12,000 yards from my aircraft in a matter of seconds. The closing speed was estimated to be over 1,000 miles per hour. As the target closed to within 5,000 yards, I turned to engage it. However, at this point the target made a sharp, instantaneous turn, and fled at a speed that was estimated to be over 1,500 miles per hour. The aircraft actually seemed to quiver in the air from the sudden change of speed. I was unable to get any radar lock on the target, and it was lost to me in a matter of seconds when it disappeared off my scope at a distance of over 20 miles.

The second similar target was picked up at 2137 in the same area at approximately 16,000 feet. This target was closing in on me at a very rapid rate. This range was steadily decreased from 12,000 yards to within 3,000 yards before the target suddenly reversed its course and fled at a speed which was obviously many times the speed of sound. It left an abrupt vapor trail as seen on the pilot's scope.

Instrument readings during the encounter showed a 3500 knot run - another target was on a collision course at 5,000 yards - the first target had been 3,500 yards at its closest point. As that first target departed I was certain it was tracking at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees. At that range the angular speed was so great it was difficult to get an accurate reading, but the target had decreased its distance from me by half in a matter of approximately 10 seconds. The aircrafts seemed to literally "fall off the scope."

As a final point, the target sights visualiy by the crew, although estimated, confirm the radar readings. The crew, Lieutenant Commander John J. Hoy and Lieutenant Donald G. Holcomb, were quite as astonished as I by the phenomenal performance and appearance of these targets.

The image appears to contain a black-and-white photograph or document. It does not depict any human faces, so I will describe the contents as requested.

The document appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The report is dated July 3, 1952 and describes an encounter between an Air Force pilot and an unidentified aerial object near Dayton, Ohio.

The report states that the pilot, Lt. John D. Kelly, was scrambled by GCI (Ground Controlled Intercept) on a mission to investigate the sighting of an unidentified radar contact. The target was tracked at an altitude of approximately 20,000 yards and held for approximately six minutes.

The report goes on to describe the target's behavior, noting that it appeared to be a "very light overgast" approximately 6,000 feet in size, with no other details observed. The report concludes that no targets were discovered, despite the extended tracking of the unidentified object.

The document is signed by John D. Kelly, Lt., USAF, and Freddy J. Krueger, Lt., USAF, presumably the officers involved in the incident.

STATEMENT

I, John T. Larkins, 1st Lt., AO 663284, assigned to the 64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, as a Radar Observer.

At 2120Z, 21 July 1952, while on a routine radar gunnery mission, radar contact was established on an unidentified target at 13,000 yards.

The target was locked-on at 12,000 yards and as the pilot could not get his guns on the unidentified target, a second pass was made at a slightly higher speed. Again the pilot could not lock-on and the target disappeared. The pilot then made an over-taking speed run of about 600 knots but was unable to get on to the target. As the target would look like on the scope, it would disappear and contact could not be re-established. The target disappeared in a north-westerly direction at an altitude of 13,500 feet.

After chasing out on two other unidentified contacts, the pilot suggested that I attempt to pick up the target again. I headed in the easterly direction at 12,000 yards. The target was again picked up at 12,000 yards. The pilot then made another pass but again was unable to lock-on as the target would disappear from the scope. This was repeated approximately 4 times, each time with the same results.

A 270° turn was made and again contact was made at 5,000 yards. Another interception was attempted. The target was held for about 30 seconds and was brought in to a range of 2,500 yards, at which time it again disappeared at a very rapid rate, and contact could not be re-established.

The radar set in this ship would be classed all smalli, and both pilot and radar observer were thoroughly experienced. 

The weather was exceptionally clear with a practically cloudless sky. 

At no time did pilot obtain visual contact with any object.

STATEMENT

I, Aubrey W. Brenner, 2nd Lt., 10 2222870, assigned to the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio, am the observer.

While flying on a routine mission in a F-94B type aircraft, I observed a light that we estimated to be fifteen (15) miles southeast of Lockbourne, Ohio. This light was observed to be moving in a northeast direction at an estimated speed of 700-800 knots, or about 800 mph. It was moving at an altitude of approximately 17,000 feet.

The light was brighter than any known running lights and appeared to be emitting its own light. This light was observed for about 4 minutes and then it stopped suddenly with no apparent deceleration.

The set was tracked on the radar set in the aircraft and showed a definite blip. The light then appeared to move to another position approximately 10 miles away. This indicated that an unknown object or vehicle had moved this distance in a very short time.

At no time did we have a speed or climb advantage.

Also, at no time was there a visual contact made with the unknown target.

The foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge.

There is no photograph present in the image. The image is a text-based "Photo Analysis Report" from Project Blue Book regarding an "Unidentified Flying Object" sighting on July 23, 1952 in New York, New York. The report provides an analysis of the object based on the information provided and concludes that the object is probably "Astronomical".

The text of the report is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: New York, New York
DATE: 23 July 1952

PHOTOGRAPHY
PURPOSES: This photo analysis report is in answer to #0 #64-62 submitted by Sergeant E. M. Moody, USAF. The image was viewed in the upper right quadrant of the photo appears to portray an object that was probably astronomical in nature.

ANALYSIS: From a technical standpoint, the analysis of the object suggests a close proximity to the centrally located light source, and reflected light distribution on the object. The similarity of the object's appearance between the front telegraph pole and back telegraph pole, and the estimation of the object's size leads to the conclusion that the object would be approximately 3 feet in diameter.

From the above evaluation and associated imagery, the object appears to have a spherical or elliptical shape and was probably astronomical in nature.

Text from the document:

FLYING SAUCER OVER NEW YORK
(Major George Gorman claimed to have chased a round saucer-like object while flying his F-51 over Fargo North Dakota on October 1, 1948. His account was confirmed by the control tower operator and Police Lt. Sherlock. The saucer moved at an extremely high rate of speed, made a turn that Gorman's fighter could not match, and at one point flew directly at Gorman, only to pull up at the last possible moment. The object emitted a pulsating glow and at times appeared to disappear completely. Gorman was unable to get close enough to the object for a visual identification.)
