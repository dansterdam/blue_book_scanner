DATE OF REPORT: 22 November 1957
SUBJECT: Sighting of unidentified flying object
SOURCE: DISC, Contact Intelligence
EVALUATION: Various

THIS IS CONCENTRIC DATA REC'D SOUTH EAST MASSACHUSETTS AREA ON 16 OCT 1957. SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

1. ENCLOSURE (1) COL DIC-ORLD Speedletter or 01899 22E-6. SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IS OCT 57, MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

The contents were promptly disseminated to local Air Force (Air) representatives.

In an aircraft to confirm the report of SUBJECT sighting, Mr. Woods Hole Commander, Woods Hole Geographic Institute, Woods Hole, Mass., and others of the expedition noted in visual sightings. They followed the object as it followed a southwesterly direction, directly into the wind, at a tremendous rate of speed, for about two miles north of Martha's Vineyard at about 1:25 local time on 12 October 57.

The object was cigar-shaped, silver in color, and seemed to have the shape and surface contour of a metallic sphere, translucent in color, and about three for its length. The distance of the object from the vessel was estimated to be about 2 miles. No vapor trail was visible, and the object was emitting no vapor.

It is advised that he is a former Air Force Major who was at one time a member of the Project Blue Book Staff/ATIC, and considered an authority on the subject.

1. Mr. George D. MAX, Chief Technical Information and Intelligence Office, District Intelligence, Cambridge 
...

2. Records of the Operations Office, MAJ. Dumont, M.I. reflect that no aircraft from unit station were observed fighting
 in the Martha's Vineyard area. 

3. Records of the Operations Office, MAJ. South Weymouth, Mass. reflect that between the hours of 1800 and 0100 on 12 October 1957, approximately 20 of these aircraft were jets. The Operations Officer advised that the duration of these operations were Handled over in Washington, and that this matter no comment further by his office.

4. Mr. John C. DUNBAR, engineering pilot, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentation Laboratory, stated that a disfunctioning test equipment was conducted by his southwest laboratory and that the M-39 involved in this burst over the Martha's Vineyard area at the time of SUM-LIGHT sighting. He advised that maximum height at the test center was 1,500 feet, and that maximum duration of the flights was 12 seconds, and that no lighter-than-air craft based at that station were in the air on 12 October.

5. Records of the Ops OFFICE, MAJ. South Weymouth, Mass. reflect the following surface weather conditions for 12 October 1957: skies clear, visibility 15 miles or greater all day, surface winds 10 to 15 knots from the northeast, and temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Records further reflect clear skies at 20,000 ft. with average winds of 20 knots from the northwest, and calm flying conditions prevailed.

Request by: The Air Technical Intelligence Center
General: The Air Technical Intelligence Center is in receipt of information which would normally provide sufficient data for identification or analysis, concerning the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Report submitted to the Commanding General, USAF, by the Commanding Officer, 14 Nov 1957 (Cont).

1. Cooperative analysis of basic data reveals certain inconformities and difficulties in analyses.

2. Photographs: No photographic data is contained in the ATIC report. Additional photographic data could not be located. If available, visual observation report would be required: spherical or oval by distance; Description of protrusions: wing tips, antenna, etc. Course of object: heading, speed, altitude.

3. Wind Directions: UNR Report: Blowing from W - NW (10-15,000 ft alt).

4. Factual Data in Support of Final Conclusion: Clear, bright, no clouds; unlimited visibility; duration about 10-15 minutes; object was observed going in westerly direction, disappearing to the west of the observers. The fact that no vapor exhaust trail was admitted rules out possibility of aircraft.

5. Analysis of similar types of UFO reports over a period of more than 10 years has shown that these reports result in significant off-the-mark conventional object identification, many inconclusive or completely unidentifiable, and an unknown percentage which may very well represent some new phenomenon under various atmospheric conditions. A review of the simple explanatory sketch is attached which may be some value in understanding more fully the nature of these phenomena, which weather unit locations and acts in a similar learning balloon actions indicate a rhumhle in elevation and oscillating path, often gives an impression of a free-floating object.

PREPARED BY: District Intelligence Officer, AND
CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED
REPORT NO.: 25-57
DATE: 12 November 1957

Preparing Officer's Comment: This report is forwarded in possible aid in evaluating SUBJECT sighting. The sighting may be more reliably reported than might at first be considered since details concerning the object sighting are more complete than many other reports received. The object apparently was observed in the New England area and other areas.

PRO-STAFF has been requested to interview Michael R. ONUFR in order to obtain a sketch of the object sighted to be forwarded direct to GHI.

Forwarding Officer's Comment: If a lst level sighting at low attitude, there most likely would have been a vapor trail even though this incident occurred before new cold fronts were frequent in New England. Also, any possible jet in the area appears to be unknown. Sighting does not develop into an observation of longer and more identifiable object was possibly/probably not a device with binocular/telescope characteristics. It appears that the unidentified object was possibly/probably not identifiable object.

Major General James H. Walsh 
Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear General Walsh,

I promised to send you the report on the sightings in Long Island Sound which occurred during your last and very welcome visit to this Center. The delay in doing this is due to the fact that your visit mentioned "Buffalo", which might have been inferred the latter and that I thought I remembered hearing "Buffalo". In this connection, I must bring information that can find no sighting in mind and which did involve the United States Navy and "Martha's Vineyard".

This Center received three separate reports of the incident with a "Blimp Evaluation" request from the Office of Naval Intelligence the first in three years.

A careful study, based on the data available (some which was inconsistently collated), indicates that the objects sighted were in the area of a radar reflector of the "corner type". A detailed evaluation with supporting material was sent to the Navy on 16 January 1958.

Letter to General Walsh did 14 Feb 58
3. This report contained the following significant points:
a. No report of anything unusual in the air at that time was received from any of some 34 aircraft known to be near the area of the sightings at that time.
b. No report of UFOs from radar units which scan the area 24 hours a day.
c. Information from Cambridge Air Force Research Center discloses that are used for tests of specially launched radar-reflecting balloons.
The fact that, from a position over the ocean, by a former CIA staff officer, a jet pilot, and "trained" military observers, a jet-propelled, "metallic-appearing" objected which was observed under the particular circumstances outlined is of interest. There are no recent reports concerning flights of such objects in this area. (Enclosure: a letter from General Lewis to General Partridge, copy of which is inclosed.)
The object was described, by the various reports, as varying from "cylindrical to round and [with] protuberances of some sort."
4. I hope this will give you the information you needed.

General Earle E. Partridge

Dear General Partridge:

I am taking the liberty of informally bringing to your attention a matter which is engaging the attention of my staff. I refer to the grave consequences that can result from pilots, radar units and other military observers retaliating, prematurely, against these unusual aerial phenomena such as fireballs, bolides, or other meteors. This condition is not participated in the international scene, but could conceivably set our retaliatory forces into motion prematurely.

Our ten years experience with the UFO program has demonstrated that these objects, despite occasional flight characteristics, mistakes and the growing concern with a satellite, guided missiles and so-called flying saucers has heightened speculation and inquiry on the part of many.

During the last twelve months, a large number of meteorites was reported throughout the country. One large brilliant fireball was observed simultaneously by numerous pilots and ground observers. The outstanding aspect of the incident was the disclosure that a number of pilots were of the opinion that the object was a missile.

An earlier sighting was brought to light by the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena in Washington, D.C. when it uncovered a 1957 "Hidden UFO Report", which had been reported to Otis Air Force Base on October 12, 1957. A strange round object, described as resembling a "flaming orange-red sphere", approached a fishing boats Atlantic and Bear and the Sport Fisherman near Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The UFO traveled at a "great rate" of speed.

The object, as seen through binoculars, appeared to be a sphere with sensing elements or spikes protruding from it. The time of the "spikes" were red. Several weeks later on November 4, an object described as a "sphere with fins" surrounding it was sighted from Cathedral City, California.

The Massachusetts sighting was turned in by three members of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution-based fishing boat Atlantic, Captain of the fishing boat Bear, and Captain of the Sport Fisherman. With these were two fliers from Charleston, South Carolina, one an Air Force jet pilot. All five men were aboard the Sport Fisherman.

The provided image contains a detailed sketch or illustration of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object appears to have a spiked or angular design with several protruding elements. The text below the image indicates that this is a "Description - sketch copy from 412 e 112" document.

OCR Output:

UFO INVESTIGATIVE JUL-AUG 1960

"HIDDEN" UFO REPORTS GIVEN NICAP

NICAP has obtained copies of several previously HIDDEN UFO reports and investigation files. As these are the sort of reports that NICAP has long been trying to obtain, we consider this an important development. Most of these reports appear to have been deliberately withheld from public knowledge.

The files received contain a number of interesting case reports. Unfortunately, many of the details are still BLOCKED OUT or missing. However, the basic facts are clear enough to indicate that at least some of the UFO reports considered SENSITIVE or CONFIDENTIAL by the military and intelligence agencies are now being gradually RELEASED through NICAP's efforts.

From 1947 through 1955, a MAJOR PART of the more significant UFO reports were apparently CLASSIFIED as SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL, and shielded from public scrutiny. NICAP has long been aware of this fact from various sources, including former military and intelligence personnel.

Even though many important details are still MISSING in the new files, the GENERAL PATTERN of OFFICIAL SECRECY and DENIAL is clearly evident. These new reports reinforce NICAP's long-held conviction that the public has been systematically DECEIVED about the TRUE nature and EXTENT of the UFO phenomenon.

NICAP plans to make these new "HIDDEN" reports available to serious researchers and writers in the near future. At the same time, we shall continue our efforts to obtain the COMPLETE, UNCENSORED files on these and other important UFO incidents. The American people are ENTITLED to know the FULL FACTS.
