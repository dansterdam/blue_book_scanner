SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 12 OCTOBER 1957, MARTHA'S VINEYARD
(THIS IN CONCERNS DESCRIPTIVE DATA RE: UFO SIGHTED IN SOUTH EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS AREA ON 12 OCT 57)

Encl: (1) Copy of DIO-GND Speedletter ser 01899 32B-61 Subject: Sighting of unidentified object 12 Oct 57, Martha's Vineyard

1. Enclosure (1) was received by this office on 16 October 1957. Its contents were promptly disseminated to Local Air Force OSI Representatives.

2. In an attempt to confirm the report of SUBJECT sighting, Mr. Woods Hole (Oceanographic Institute, Woods Hole, Mass.) and owner of the vessel noted in enclosure (1) was interviewed. He gave the following account of SUBJECT sighting: Mr. together with four others (noted in enclosure (1)) were fishing in a vessel located about two nautical miles west of Martha's Vineyard at about 1525 local time on 12 October 1957, when a strange object, spherical or oval in shape with small protruding antennas was observed, seemingly diving, directly towards the vessel. The object reveled off and headed in a southwest direction, directly into the wind, at a tremendous rate of speed. He and others in the vessel had opportunity to view this object through binoculars as it was in view for approximately two minutes. The object, so viewed, appeared to have shape end surface contour of a milk-weed pod, translucent in color, and about three feet in length (no actual measurement, but this was the idea of the distance of the object from the vessel). The object was emitting no vapor trail.

3. Advised that he is a former Air Force Major, who was at one time a member of General Vacarthur staff, GHQ, Southwest Pacific, the source of the information.

INFORMATION REPORT

CONFIDENTIAL

FROM: District Intelligence Officer, 1ND                REPORT NO. 43-57        DATE 14 November 1957

Information in enclosure (1) is a former jet pilot with considerable experience in identifying strange objects, and who at one time had been stationed at the Pentagon with the War Planning Division and that two others in the group had been "observers" in the armed services.

SUBJECT: Further advised that he had no companions felt that this object was definitely a controlled vehicle. _______ stated that he had made report of this sighting to authorities at Otis Air Force Base, Falmouth, Mass. at 2000 on 12 October 1957.

4. Mr. George D. MAY, chief, Technical Information and Intelligence Officer, _______ Cambridge Research Center, Hanscom Field, Bedford, Mass., stated that although reports of _______ sighted in the New England area should be directed to his office, no such report was received from Otis Air Force Base concerning SUBJECT sighting, nor were any such reports received concerning similar sightings on 12 October 1957.

5. Records of the Operations Office, NAS, Quonset Point, R.I. reflect that no aircraft from that station were in the Marthas Vineyard area at the time of SUBJECT sighting.

6. Records of the Operations Office, NAS, South Weymouth, Mass. reflect that between the hours of 1500 - 1700 (local time) 12 October, 1957 approximately 34 planes, piloted by Reservists were in operation; approximately 20 of these aircraft were jets. The Operations officer advised that no record of the areas in which these planes had operated were kept, and that since no restriction are placed on the areas in which these planes may operate any of these craft might have been in the Marthas Vineyard area at the time of SUBJECT sighting. He advised that maximum height at which any of these planes would have operated is 25,000 feet. He further indicated that none of these planes would have been involved in any special operations such as air-to-air gunnery exercises, and that no light-than-air craft based at that station were in the air on 12 October 1957.

7. Mr. John C. DUNBAR, engineering pilot, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentation Laboratory, Flight Facility, Concord, Mass., advised that a dive-bombing test conducted by that facility was underway at the time of SUBJECT sighting in an area approximately 35 miles to the northeast of Marthas Vineyard. DUNBAR stated that he, himself, piloted the F-94 involved in this test, but indicated that on no occasion had he come closer to Marthas Vineyard then to pass twenty miles to the north of it. He noted that the speed of his F-94 would approach 500 mph during a dive, and that each dive would last from 10 to 15 seconds. He further noted that since the plane used in the test was silver in color it could very easily have been reflecting sunlight to any observer to the west at that time of day.

8. Records of the Aerology Office, NAS, South Weymouth, Mass. reflect the following surface weather conditions for 12 October 1957: skies clear, visibility 15 miles or greater all day; surface winds of 10 kts. from west northwest, with maximum gust of 28 kts; temperature minimum 37 degrees, maximum 59 degrees, average 47.6 degrees; relative humidity at 1300 51 per cent, at 1900 38 per cent. Records further reflect clear skies at 20,000 ft. with average 35 kt. winds from 310 degrees; temperature - 2 degrees, Good flying conditions prevailed throughout the entire 24 hour period.

Request by U. S. Navy for "Blitz" Evaluation

1. General: The Air Technical Intelligence Center is in receipt of three official reports on subjecting incidents. This would normally provide sufficient data for identification or valid conclusions. Ref: Flash Report TT Msg, WOIN-5281, dtd 13 Oct 57 (uncl), USAF AISR Report from 1608th ATW, Charleston AFB, S. C. (Uncl) and UNI Report No. 43-57, dtd 14 Nov 1957 (Conf).

However, a comparative analysis of basic data reveals certain inconsistencies and discrepancies among the three reports, which presents some difficulties to analyses.

2. Inconsistencies and Discrepancies:
a. Shape: Given as cylindrical by AIIR Report; spherical or oval by ONI report and spherical in TT Msgs.
b. Description of Protuberances: ONI report: small antennae, TT Msgs: prongs.
c. Course of Object: ONI Report: heading SW, AIIR: SE (from 15 degrees to 35 degrees from heading of vessel) hovered for 90 seconds, disappeared.
d. Wind Directions: ONI Reports: from W - NW, TT Msgs: from W (10-15,000 ft alt), AIIR: not given in basic data.

3. Data in Agreement:
a. Time of Sighting: All approximately 1535 local time, 12 October 1957.
b. Aids to Sighting: All observers used binoculars. (Presuming at least 7 power, the object undoubtedly appeared substantially larger than the actual size.)
c. Maneuvers: These were described variously as stationary, hovering reversing, diving, descending, drifting on observer's back, etc.
d. Vapor, exhaust, jet, trail emitted: all reports; none observed, through any of the maneuvers described.

4. Factual Data in Support of Final Conclusion:
a. Sun was fairly low toward horizon at that time, and West of the object.
b. Weather conditions: clear, bright, no clouds, unlimited visibility.
c. The aggregate of maneuvers given in all reports is characteristic of balloons.
d. The fact that no vapor, exhaust, or trail was emitted rules out propulsive devices (aircraft and missiles), also strongly suggestive of a balloon.
e. Analysis of similar type of UFO reports over a period of more than ten years has shown that reflection of a setting sun in a slant range off a man-surfaced or spherical object (specular reflection) often produces unusual or odd appearance to otherwise conventional objects. (Photographic conditions of a balloon with one design of radar reflector, under varying conditions of light, as well as a simple explanatory sketch, is attached)
f. Check discloses that the NE of Martha's Vineyard, Mass. A further check with weather until local landing balloons indicates a number were located Northwest of the area that the object was sighted. (Small localized area on spot weather map having wind eddies, swirls, or temporary reverse direction flows, often give an impression of a free-floating object moving against the wind.)

DATE

14 November 1957

Preparing Officer's Comment: This report is forwarded as a possible aid in evaluating SUBJECT sighting as originally reported in enclosure (1). Considering the backgrounds of ONUFER and VESTA, it appears that this sighting may be more reliable than might at first be deemed. Furthermore, it is noted that this reported sighting appears to contain certain details not altogether inconsistent with the reports of more recent and highly publicized sightings in Texas, New Mexico and other areas.

DIO-GND has been requested to reinterview Michael R. ONUFER in order to obtain a sketch of the object sighted to be forwarded direct to GWI.

Prepared:
J. V. McCARTIN
ENS, USNR

Forwarding Officer's Comment: If a jet were at extreme altitude, there most likely would have been a vapor trail, even though this incident occurred before severe cold fronts were frequent in New England. Also, any possible jet in the area appeared to be piloted by Reservists who would likely not have flown above 25,000 ft. Any jet diving and pulling out, would have been longer and more identifiable, therefore it appears that the unidentified object was possibly/probably not a jet aircraft.

Major General James H. Walsh
Deputy, Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear General Walsh,

I promised to send you the report on the sightings in Long Island Sound which you brought to my attention during your last and very welcome visit to this Center. The delay in doing this is due to the fact that you had mentioned "Buffalo" and "2000 MPH" as having been involved. I told you that I remembered "High Speed" which might have interfered. The letter and that I thought I remembered hearing "Buffalo". In this case, I must have been mistaken; we can find no sighting involving it. Maybe, I had better give you the synopsis which I had in mind and which did involve the United States Navy and "Martha's Vineyard" around 14 October 1957.

1. This Center received three separate reports of the incident with a "Blitz Evaluation" request from the Office of Naval Intelligence the first in three years.

2. A careful study, based on the data available (some which was inconclusive), and check of activities and operations in the area indicates that the object was undoubtedly a balloon with a radar reflector of the "corner type". A detailed evaluation with supporting material was sent to the Navy on 16 January 1958.

Letter to General Walsh dtd 14 Feb 58

3. This report contained the following significant points:

a. No report of anything unusual in the air at that time was received from any of some 34 aircraft known to be near the area of the sighting at that time.

b. No report of UFOs from radar units which scan the area 24 hours a day.

c. Information from Cambridge Air Force Research Center discloses that area used for tests of aerially launched radar-reflector balloons.

d. The fact that the object was seen, from a small moving boat, by a former G14 staff officer, a jet pilot, and a "trained" military observer, respectively, does not rule out the possibility of failure to recognize a conventional object under the particular circumstances existing at the time. There are many such cases on record in the UFO program. (Reference is made to suggested letter from General Lewis to General Partridge, copy of which is enclosed.)

e. The object was described, by the various reports, as varying from cylindrical to round and from "hovering" to "high speed". All statements agreed that the object appeared to have protuberances of some sort.

4. I hope this will give you the information you needed.

Sincerely,

General Earle E. Partridge
Commander-in-Chief
North American Air Defense Command
Ent Air Force Base, Colorado

Dear General Partridge:

I am taking the liberty of informally bringing to your attention a matter which is regarded with some concern by my staff. I refer to the grave consequences that can result from pilots, radar units and other military observers mistaking natural aerial phenomena such as fireballs, bolides, or other meteorites for hostile devices. This concern is shared by scientists participating in the International Geophysical Year, as well as others in the field of meteorics.

In periods of tense international relations or impending hostilities, mistakes of this nature could conceivably set our retaliatory forces into motion prematurely.

Our ten years experience with the UFO Program has demonstrated that training, flight experience and education or status in life do not necessarily preclude such mistakes and the growing concern with satellite, guided missiles and so-called flying saucers has heightened speculation and anxiety on the part of many.

During the last twelve months, a large number of meteorites was reported throughout the country. One large brilliant fireball was observed simultaneously by numerous pilots and ground observers in six Western states, last October. The unfortunate aspect of the incident was the disclosure that a number of pilots were of the opinion that the object was a missile.

All this is submitted in the interest of the nation's defense system and for whatever action you may consider necessary.

- page 20 -

An earlier sighting was brought to light by the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena in Washington, D.C. when it uncovered a 1957 "Hidden UFO Report", which had been reported to Otis Air Force Base on October 12, 1957. At 3:20 P.M. a strange round object, bearing southeast, approached a fishing boats Atlantic and Bear and the Sport Fisherman near Martha's Vineyard, Mass. The sky was clear, wind north, 5 m.p.h. The UFO traveled at a "great rate" of speed.

The object as seen through binoculars, appeared to be a sphere with sensing elements or spikes protruding from it. The tips of the "spikes" were red.

Several weeks later on November 4 an object described as a "sphere with fins surrounding it" was sighted from Cathedral City, California.

The Massachusetts sighting was turned in by three members of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution-[redacted], Captain [redacted] of the fishing boat [redacted] and Captain [redacted] with these were two fliers from Charleston, South Carolina, one an Air Force jet pilot. All five men were aboard [redacted] boat, the Sports Fisherman.

5. Conclusions: On the basis of the above data, and the fact that nothing unusual in the air was seen or reported by any of the 34 aircraft in the area at that time, or by radar units which scan the sector 24 hours of the day, there is no compelling reason to conclude that the object was other than a balloon, or a balloon-supported device.
