Office Memorandum - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
DATE: 19 July 1950
TO: Lt Colonel Harter
FROM: Colonel Pettine
SUBJECT: Investigation of "Flying Saucer" Reports

Mr. S--- memo dated 14 Jul 50 has been reviewed. Although investigation of this matter, it appears that too much time was spent in the investigation. It is suggested that in future incidents we contact the individual concerned to get the story he or she has to tell, and unless there is some physical evidence that if a legitimate sighting is made, it would be reported by a number of people, extensive investigation should not be conducted. This matter is perhaps one which would interest higher echelons who might wish to pursue it further.

Office Memorandum - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
TO: Lt Colonel Fullerton
FROM: Colonel Failing
SUBJECT: Investigation of "Flying Saucer" Reports
DATE: 19 July 1950

The text in the document states that an attached memo dated 14 Jul 50 has been reviewed, and although it appears that too much time was spent on the investigation, it is suggested that a detailed review be made of the case history to see if there is any incident that has not been reported by other personnel on the same incident. It also states that any additional evidence contracting or confirming the same incident should be reported by a number of people, and that the excessive contacts can only be kept at a minimum if information in these matters can be limited.

In view of this, no explanation can be made of the sightings other than the general explanation which is contained in the Intelligence Department report on this subject.
