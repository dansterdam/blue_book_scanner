Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Lt Colonel Hamstreet
FROM: Colonel Peiling
SUBJECT: Investigation of "Flying Saucer" Reports

My memo dated 14 Jul 50 has been reviewed. Although investigation was requested in this matter, it appears that too much time was spent in the investigation. It is suggested that a future incident be more concise in the individual concerned to get the story he or she has to tell. If, however, there have been no reports by other personnel on the same incident, it seems that there is no justification for contacting as many agencies as was done in this case. It seems evident that if a legitimate sighting is made, it would be reported by a number of people. Excessive contacts can only serve to keep our interest in these matters a subject of discussion by more people than we would like.

Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: MCIARA
FROM: MCIARA-1
DATE: 14 July 1950

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

UNCLASSIFIED
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
DECLASSIFIED AFTER DOD DIR 5200.10

1. Mrs [redacted] who is employed in the Advertising Department of the Home Store in Dayton, reported to friends working in the Intelligence Department she observed an unidentified flying object this date. Mrs [redacted] was contacted by the undersigned to get further details on the instance. No name was given nor was the fact that she was connected with AMC discussed. Mrs [redacted] seemed to be very intelligent in this conversation. The following details were reported:

a. Location object cited: While driving automobile on Martindale Road at Frederick Pike approximately six miles west of Vandalia, time - 0830.

b. Description: Mrs [redacted] described the object as spherical and pointed out it looked much like a parachute and was traveling at a high rate of speed in a northeast direction. It was stated that the most significant fact noticed was that although the sun was very bright at that time there ap- peared to be no reflection from the object. The color was described as grayish white. No sound was heard. It was observed for approximately one-half minute before it disappeared. It was estimated that it was at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

c. Investigation: The operations people were contacted and it was determined that no Air Force parachute drops were made this morning. The weather people both at AMC and the chief forecaster, Mr. J. Stephens at Vandalia, were contacted regarding the possibility of weather balloons being in the vicinity. However, no such balloons were released today. It was also pointed out that there was a remote possibility that the object could have been a large radio signal weather balloon. These balloons are released at Chanute Field, Illinois, and also Toledo, Ohio. The wind at Vandalia this morning was from the northeast at seven mph and a clear sky was reported.

d. Dr. Holton at the Air Institute was contacted to determine if possibly an astronomical explanation for such a sighting at this time was available. He advised that it would be impossible to sight any planets during the day at this time of the year. In view of this, no explanation can be made of the sighting other than the general explanation which is contained in the Intelligence Department report on this subject.

2. As a matter of interest in the connection, Miss [redacted] in MCIARA-1 reported that she observed what looked like a flying saucer above Area C when entering Area A to report for work this morning, time 0751, location: above Area C. A 1,000 feet when first noticed and object climbed to approximately 10,000 feet. Description reported was that the object was very bright and a silver color looking very much like a flying saucer. It was observed for several minutes and no sound could be associated with the object. Miss [redacted] stated that she felt that it was a small airplane taking off from Patterson Field which gave the impression of being a flying saucer due to the reflection of the sun's rays.
