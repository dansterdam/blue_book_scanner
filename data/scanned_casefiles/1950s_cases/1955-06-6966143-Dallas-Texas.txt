II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE seemed to be an intelligent young woman. SOURCE had slight high school studies, and was very active in Civil Defense work. She was rather vague in answering a few questions, but preparing officer believes that SOURCE would be considered fairly reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

1. On the night of 20 June 1955, SOURCE was visited by a neighbor, Mr. John Stewart, who stated that he had observed an unknown object in the sky a few minutes earlier, (approximately 2200 CST). SOURCE, her husband, and Mr. Stewart went outside and within a period of five minutes sighted a round, reddish object which appeared to be in the southwestern sector of the sky. Object appeared to be as large as a bright star, however the object was red in color and round in shape. The object was travelling north at a great speed, and soon was out of sight. A few minutes later, the object appeared again in the same area vertically, from west to east. It appeared to hover over a neighbor's house and SOURCE stated that the object looked much larger in size than it did previously. The size of the object appeared comparable to that of a salad plate. The object then resumed speed and faded out of view in the north.

2. SOURCE stated she actually observed the object for a total time of one minute thirty seconds.

3. Sunset on the night of the observation was 1938 CST.

4. SOURCE could not give the actual times of the sightings nor the duration of time between the sightings.

5. Sighting of the object was strictly visual.

II.  RELIABILITY: SOURCE'S description of sighting was excellent and in great
     detail. He was quite familiar with the latest type jet aircraft, astronomy, and
     weather balloons. SOURCE was very familiar with vector problems, angular distances,
     and bearing trans. The SOURCE is a present a Civil Engineer working for a Dallas
     construction company. Preparing officer considers the SOURCE to be reliable.

III. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MEETING:

     1. On Monday 20 June 1955 at approximately 2200 hours CST, SOURCE was
     aroused by conversation in front of his home and stepped outside. SOURCE,
     accompanied by his neighbors sighted a rapidly moving light, brighter looking than a
     first magnitude star. The light traveled at a speed about three times greater than
     any aircraft he had ever seen. The light made three passes over approximately the
     same course. The time of the observation was more than sixty seconds at each sighting.

     2. SOURCE stated that there was no moon present on the night of the
     observation, but there were many stars in the sky.

     3. The lights seemed to be at an altitude of seventy-five thousand feet.

     4. At no time did the SOURCE state that he had seen an object. All the
     SOURCE saw was an incandescent light or lights.

     5. The edges of the light were similar to that of a bright star.

     6. Without field glasses, the light seemed to be about the size of a pin
     head when held at arm's length. When the field glasses were used, the light appeared
     to be about the size of a quarter when held in the hand at arm's length.

     7. SOURCE estimated the length of the light to be three hundred feet.

     8. Observer first sighted the light in the northwest.

FROM: Flight 2-D, 4602D ATSS                REPORT NO. 2D-UFOB-5-55 PART EIGHT    PAGE 29 of 29 PAGES

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by a meteorite for the following reasons:

    a. All sources stated that the lights or objects sighted were round in shape.

    b. Sources stated that the sizes of the lights or objects varied from that of a pinpoint to the size of a half dollar.

    c. Colors of the lights or objects were yellow, red, white and olive green.

    d. Speeds of the lights or objects were very fast, erratic and crossed large portions of sky in a few seconds.

    e. The formation was that of a small group when viewed through field glasses and when sighted visually, only one object was sighted.

    f. To their knowledge, no source observed a trail and no sound was present.

    g. The time of any of the sightings did not exceed 90 seconds and the observation occurred at 2400Z 21 June 1955.

Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. This headquarters does not concur with the conclusions of the Preparing Officer for the following reasons:

    a. The sources' descriptions of the flight characteristics and flight path of the object do not compare with that of a meteorite.

    b. The duration of sighting is too long for a meteorite.

    c. Sources stated that they believed they saw the same object three separate times rather than three separate objects, with a time lapse between sightings.

    d. One reliable source stated that the object was not a meteorite.

2. This report is forwarded to ATIC as unresolved.

I.  SOURCE:   RICHARD SCHWIER BARRY
    Address:  3119 San Lucas Dr., Dallas, Texas
    Occupation: Captain, U.S. Marine Corps
    Education: Post Graduate work - 2 years, Duke University
    Qualifications: Communications officer, Recruiting officer

II. RELIABILITY:  SOURCE was above average in intelligence and deemed very serious
    about the sighting. His description of the object was in great detail. SOURCE was
    quite conversant and answered all questions in a straight forward manner. He was
    quite familiar with some of the latest type aircraft and weather balloons.
    Preparing Officer believes the SOURCE to be reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

    1. On Monday evening, 2200 CST 20 June 1955, SOURCE'S neighbor, Mr. John
    Stewart, visited SOURCE and asked him to step outside. They did, and started
    pointed to the heavens in a southwesterly direction (generally toward the city of
    Dallas, Texas). The SOURCE sighted a dull red object which was changing in color to
    a grayish-with-yellow. The object dropped from a seventy degree elevation to a
    forty degree elevation. The SOURCE could make no estimate as to the altitude of the
    object. This object appeared to hover momentarily, and then accelerate in speed.

    SOURCE related this speed to be greater than that of any jet aircraft. He had ever
    observed. After this burst of speed, the object was sighted again in the western
    part of the sky, and again second to no known aircraft. (SOURCE immediately
    rushed indoors to get his binoculars (eight by thirty-five in measurement). He
    returned in time to focus the binoculars on the object. Upon viewing the focal
    northeastern sector of the sky. Thru the binoculars, the object appeared to be round,
    flat and red in color. Three lights appeared to be in a straight line, horizontal
    to the path of flight of the object. SOURCE estimated the total time of the sighting
    to be approximately sixty to ninety seconds. SOURCE stated he was close to ground
    before the object was sighted for the second time. It appeared from the west and
    traveled straight toward the SOURCE. The object was a grayish-yellow-white in
    quite in color. The object came out of the west at an angle of sixty degrees, wearing
    to the right and left. Upon viewing the object thru the binoculars, the SOURCE saw
    the binoculars, the SOURCE stated that there were three brilliant white-yellow
    lights in a straight line with a red light in the lead.

    2. The third sighting was quite similar to the first. The colors were the
    same and the object appeared and disappeared in the same manner. This time, however
    the object did not appear to lower. Reference inclosure #1 to part 1, SOURCE'S
    sketch of flight of object.

    Pt. 2  North Star
    Pt. 3  Object hovered

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 2-D, 4602d AISS                   2D-PROB-5-55 PART ONE    PAGE    3    OF    21    PAGES

Pt. 2 Three brilliant whitish-yellow lights preceded by a red glow with no outline present (through field glasses).

Pt. 3 Three brilliant whitish-yellow lights preceded by a red light. The outline of the lights was blurry and the edges fuzzy.

3. SOURCE was certain that the actual time of the sighting was one minute and eight, seconds.

4. There were a few stars in the sky and a small moon.

5. SOURCE estimated this object to be about one mile away and solid in shape.

6. SOURCE stated that he believed he saw the same object three separate times rather than three different objects because time was adequate time for the object to circle back because of its tremendous rate of speed.

7. SOURCE stated that the object was about the size of a baseball held and a clear sky.

8. The night of the sighting was very warm, dry, with a slight breeze and a clear sky.

9. SOURCE stated that he had no conception of what the object might have been but that it was not a meteorite.
