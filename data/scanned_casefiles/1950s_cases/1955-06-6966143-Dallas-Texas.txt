II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appears normal to be an average housewife. SOURCE had rather vague in answering a few questions, but preparing officer believes that SOURCE would be considered a reliable witness.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On the evening of March 19, 1955, SOURCE was visited by a neighbor, Mr. John Stewart, who stated that he had observed an unknown object in the sky a few minutes earlier. SOURCE then went outside to observe the object. OBJECT appeared to be in the southwestern sky and was about 6 or 8 times larger than a star. OBJECT appeared to be a brilliant light and seemed to be moving slowly in a southeasterly direction. After observing the OBJECT for a few minutes, it disappeared. SOURCE then returned inside.
Later, the OBJECT appeared again in the same area traveling from east to west. The OBJECT appeared illuminated and seemed to change shape occasionally. SOURCE observed the OBJECT for a few minutes, after which it appeared to move out of sight.
The OBJECT appeared comparable to that of a small plate. The OBJECT then resumed speed and disappeared.

Reference includes #1 of Part 2. SOURCE'S sketch of the flight path of the object.
Pt. 1 Vanishing point of object on 2nd sighting
Pt. 2 Origin of object on 2nd sighting

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE's description of sighting was excellent and in great detail. THE OBJECT was visible to other persons and weather conditions were clear. SOURCE was very familiar with various jet propelled aircraft and their normal flight characteristics. He states the OBJECT was completely unfamiliar to him.

III. DETAILS OF SIGHTING:
The incident occurred on 29 June 1955 at approximately 2300 hours CST. SOURCE was at his residence in Dallas, Texas. He observed the OBJECT for a period of about 5-10 minutes.
The OBJECT appeared to be round, silvery white in color, and appeared to be revolving. The light traveled at a speed vastly greater than any jet aircraft known to SOURCE. The OBJECT made no noise. The light traveled in a straight line and would occasionally blink out, then reappear farther along its course. Viewing the OBJECT through binoculars, SOURCE could discern no details of structure other than its round, revolving shape. All lights were parallel to the flight path of the OBJECT. 
On the first pass, SOURCE only observed a white light, but he was not seeing the entire OBJECT. On the second pass, he observed the revolving silvery white OBJECT. The OBJECT seemed to be about the size of a car when viewed through binoculars.
3. OBSERVER stated that there was no moon present on the night of the observation, and weather conditions were clear.
4. The OBJECT seemed to be at an altitude of 7,000-8,000 feet, going east to west. All its movement was silent.
5. It is the opinion of the OBSERVER that the OBJECT seen was a phenomenon not capable of being produced by any known type of aircraft.
7. SOURCE estimated the length of the OBJECT to be three hundred feet. 
8. OBSERVER first sighted the OBJECT in the northeast.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE answered all questions in an informal, conversational manner. The source was cooperative in answering ALL questions.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE INCIDENT:

The initial sighting was on 28 May 1955, 9:30 PM CDT. The object was first observed by the SOURCE's husband as he was returning home from work. He called the SOURCE outside to observe the object. 

The object appeared to be oval in shape and very bright and shiny. The object appeared to be revolving on its axis, which made it hard to estimate its exact size and shape. The revolving action of the object produced a flickering effect making it difficult to determine exactly how high the object was or how far away it was.

The object appeared to be hovering and remained stationary in one spot about 500 yards to the north. During the second and third sightings, the altitude of the object appeared to be lower and seemed to be moving in a westerly direction. On the third sighting, the object appeared to be revolving even faster. 

REFERENCE: Inclosure #1 of part 4. SOURCE'S sketch of the flight path of the object.

Pt. 1 Object vanished on third sighting

2. DURATION: The total time the object was under observation was one minute.

3. The object seemed to be much brighter than the background or the sky and brighter than any star in the sky.

4. The object seemed to stand and solid.

5. SOURCE did not observe the object through field glasses at any time.

U.S. INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS were cleared, friendly, and cooperative. All questions answered to their satisfaction. The object followed an erratic course, sometimes remaining stationary and at other times moving at extremely rapid speed. The object appeared as an intense light, dimming and brightening alternately. The object was observed through binoculars. Reporting officer believes the source to be reliable.

This source provided the following DETAILS OF SIGHTING: On 29 January 1955, 9:30 P.M., Geographical location: 10 miles southwest of Dallas, Texas. The object followed an erratic course in the southwest direction. The object was observed and tracked for a total of twenty-five to thirty seconds. The time of the first sighting was also 9:30 P.M.

The object appeared to be round in shape and of large size. On the second sighting the object was observed through binoculars. During this sighting the object appeared to have a light colored ring or halos around it. The object remained in view for an additional twenty seconds. 

At 2215 P.M., 20 June 1955, the object was sighted a third time. During this sighting the object appeared to have multiple fans or propeller-like extensions. During the sighting the object appeared as three bright incandescent lights. The lights were seen to be spinning or rotating. The final time the object was observed was at 2230.

At 2230 P.M., 20 June 1955, the fourth sighting occurred. The object appeared on a course of 190 degrees and was traveling at a high rate of speed. This sighting lasted approximately five seconds. During this sighting, there were five green lights accompanied by a red light on the trailing edge of the object.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE seemed to be a very intelligent young woman. She had had some training in the field of meteorology and was able to discuss questions in a clear and conversational manner and without hesitation. Reporting officer believes the SOURCE to be reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTING:
The object was about 2.50 CST to June 1955. SOURCE first observed the object silhouetted against the sky. It was the size of a dime held at arm's length and seemed to be aluminum in color. It moved in a downward direction at a very rapid rate of speed, much faster than anything the SOURCE had ever seen. The object moved in a straight line and stopped abruptly. The object remained stationary for about 1 minute, then it began to climb and moved away in a horizontal line until it disappeared from sight. The object was observed to be metallic in appearance, but was a slightly more watery in color than a jet plane would have been. On the third sighting the object appeared to be cigar-shaped.

1. SOURCE could not remember the exact time of the sightings.
2. SOURCE stated that she observed only one object.
3. SOURCE was a brilliant while in color and object would turn red before disappearing.
4. SOURCE was looking to the southwest when the object was first sighted.
5. SOURCE had no conception of what the object might have been or what it was doing there.
