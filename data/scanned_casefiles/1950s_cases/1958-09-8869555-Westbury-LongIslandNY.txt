Science News Letter for August 23, 1958

Mars Draws Near

The three planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, in addition to many first-magnitude stars, will be evident in the September evening sky.

By JAMES STOKLEY

STEADILY DRAWING closer to the earth, the red planet Mars is becoming increasingly conspicuous in the evening sky. About 52,000,000 miles away at the start of September, it will move in to a distance of 35,000,000 miles by the end of the month. At the same time it will increase in brightness from about 1.2 to nearly 1.5 on the astronomical scale by Sept. 30.

The position of Mars, while it is now on the celestial meridian at the first of Taurus, will then be shown on the sky map as keeping about 10 p.m. your own time (daylight saving) on Sept. 1; an hour earlier at the middle of the month, and two hours earlier at the close. The red color of Mars, and the fact that it is brighter than any other planet or any star visible at the same time, will be easy to identify.

Earlier in the evening, however, Jupiter, in the south, and its west neighbor in Virgo, the virgin, and gets before the times for which our maps are prepared; at about nine o'clock at the first of September. By the end of the month it will descend below the horizon soon after the sun that you will note is also rising in the east.

Saturn is shown in Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer, low in the southwest. Of magnitude 0.7, it is about a third as bright as Mars is, at the beginning of September.

Turning to the stars that are seen, these evenings, the brightest is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre, high in the west. A little to the east of this group you will see Cygnus, the swan, in which the star Deneb shines. Toward the south in Altair, in Aquila, the eagle. These three bright stars, all of the first magnitude, form what is sometimes called the summer triangle, because it is so conspicuous on summer evenings.

Three other first-magnitude stars are also shown. All of them are now quite low in the sky, where the increased absorption of their light by the atmosphere causes them to appear rather fainter than they should.

Low in the northeast, to the left of Mars, you will find Capella in Auriga, the charioteer. In the northwest is Arcturus, in Bootes, the bear-driver. And in the south there stands Fomalhaut, in Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish.

Destination: Lyra

Lyra, which shines high overhead these evenings, has a number of points of interest. The entire solar system, the sun and all the planets, is moving through space toward Lyra at a speed of about 12 miles per second. The earth's distance to Vega, in Lyra, is about 23 light years; that is, 23 times the six trillion miles that a ray of light, traveling 186,000 miles each second, will cover in a year. This distance is lessening at the rate of more than 20 miles per second. Not only is the earth approaching Lyra, but Vega itself is moving toward our part of the sky at about 8.5 miles per second.

Here is the text from the document:

It is not so accurately almost that there is any possibility of it ever hitting us.

The point highest star in Lyra, Sheliak, or beta Lyra, is the one shown on the south- ern sky map just above the R in the name "Lyra." As discovered in 1784 by John Goodricke, a 20-year-old deaf mute and amateur astronomer in England, Sheliak is a variable star. Ordinarily of magnitude 3.4 or slightly fainter than gamma Lyrae, the star just to the left, every 12.9 days it drops to about 4.5, about 2.75 times as faint.

Double Star
Actually there are two stars, very close together. One is relatively bright, and large, about 20 or more times the diameter of the sun. The other is smaller and fainter. Once in each 12.9-day cycle, the darker star passes directly in front of the brighter one, and the partial eclipse causes the reduction in brightness. Half way between these eclipses there is a lesser eclipse, as the bright star hides the faint one. This causes a smaller reduction in light.

Surrounding the pair there is a huge shell of gas, mainly hydrogen. This seems to originate in two streams that squirt out from each star toward the other. The streams do not hit the other stars, however, because of their movement around the center of gravity of the system.

There is a marked difference in color of the two stars. The large bright one is bluish, while the other is yellow-white. It would be most interesting to observe the system from a closer position.

Actually, what is known about beta Lyrae has been learned from studies of its spectrum, the band of color, crossed by dark lines, which is produced when its light is analyzed by a spectroscope, attached to a large telescope. The spectrum undergoes sudden and curious changes. Astronomers have worked out the hypothetical structure described above as an explanation. There are still some very puzzling features, and Sheliak continues to be the subject of much astronomical research.

This image appears to be a map or chart with a grid overlay. The map shows geographical features with latitude and longitude lines. The map seems to cover a portion of North America, with coastlines and land masses visible. The grid is composed of diagonal and horizontal lines, creating a complex geometric pattern across the map. There are numerical markings along the edges of the map, but they are too small to read clearly in this image.
