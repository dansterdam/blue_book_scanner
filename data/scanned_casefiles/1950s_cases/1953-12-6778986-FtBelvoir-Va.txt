TO: Commander
Headquarters Command
Bolling Air Force Base

1. This office received the following letter dated 21 December 1953 from the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, O-2, Washington 25, D.C.:

"1. Between 0530 and 0515, 16 December 1953, five members of the 515th Engineer Pipeline Company observed three bright objects pass overhead at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The objects were pale blue-green in color and appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, witnessed by three of the five witnesses, Cpl. X and Pvt. Y at 0939, 15 December 1953."

"2. Narrative report of interview follows:

"Pvt. Z observed, at approximately 0930, a bright illuminous object without definite shape at an altitude of approximately 1,000-6,000 ft in a WSW direction from the 515th Engineer Pipeline Company Operations. Upon being questioned, Pvt. Z brought this to the attention of Cpl. Y, who also witnessed this object. As a second illuminous object became visible at approximately 0935, it appeared to turn the sky over, but not of such intensity to disthanchen (sic) the stars. Both objects then appeared to be moving, the first (which appeared first) at a somewhat slower rate than the second. The color of the objects appeared to be most noticeable at the time."

"Both objects were bright, but not of such intensity to disthanchen (sic) the sky. The objects turn the sky over, but not of such intensity to ditch ance. the stars and green. The red color seemed to be most noticeable at the time the objects appeared to be moving, closer being more notice able than when stationary."

"The objects were approximately 75 degrees apart; the first appearing to be over Davison Army Air Field, the second (which appeared later) to the southwest."

about 0515 was to the right of the first object in a westerly direction. This object appeared to move erratically, a disappearance of one another; they appeared to move closer to and also away from the observers, as well as moving laterally. The movements were jerky and not of great distances.

when the first sighted object disappeared beyond the horizon at approximately 0530; the second was not visible after approximately 0535 as the daylight made the object disappearable.

The guard on duty between 0530-0600, 16 December 53 at Davison Army Air Field, was contacted to determine if he had observed anything unusual. He stated that he had not. Aviation Branch at Davison Field was contacted to determine if they could ascertain any unidentified aircraft in this area between 0530-0615, 16 Dec 53; they could not.

This office is being forwarded for your information. Should further interest be expressed by higher headquarters, this office is prepared to render any assistance possible.
