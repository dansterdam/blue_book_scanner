INDORSEMENT

To:    Commander

1. This office received the following letter dated 21 December 1953 from the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Washington 25, D.C.:

    "1. Between 0530 and 0515, 16 December 53, five members of the 515th Engineer Pipeline Company, assigned to the headquarters, observed two unidentified illuminous airborne objects. Three of the witnesses, Cpl [redacted] were interviewed by G2, ISC at 0930, 16 December 53.

    "2. Narrative report of interview follows:

    "Pvt [redacted] observed, at approximately 0530, a bright illuminous object without definite shape at an altitude of approximately 1,000-6,000 in a WSW direction from the 515th Engineer Pipeline Company Operations Office on Stump Dump Road, Fort Belvoir. [redacted] brought this to the attention of Cpl [redacted], Sgt [redacted], and Pfc [redacted] of his unit, all of whom witnessed this object. A second illuminous object became visible at approximately 0515, being smaller in apparent size, and apparently at greater distance from the observers. Witnesses were unable to estimate the distance to the objects.

    "Both objects were bright, but not of such intensity to disturb the eyes - appeared as intense as star light. Both objects changed color at irregular intervals; colors observed were red, blue and green. The red color seemed to be most noticeable at the time the objects appeared to be moving closer to the observers.

    "The objects were approximately 75 degrees apart, the first appearing to be over Davidson Army Air Field, the second (which appeared

about 0515) was to the right of the first object in a westerly direction. Both objects moved erratically, independent of one another; they appeared to move closer to and also away from the observatory, as well as moving laterally. The movements were jerky and not of great distances.

"The first sighted object disappeared beyond the horizon at approximately 0600; the second was not visible after approximately 0615 as the dawn's light made the object imperceptible.

"3. The guard on duty between 0501-0600, 16 December 53 at Davidson army air field, Pvt. [redacted], Co B, 969th Engineer Construction Bn, was questioned to determine if he had observed any unusual airborne objects or unusual 16 Dec 53 while on guard. No aviation branch at Davidson Field was contacted to determine if they could explain any unidentified airborne objects in their area between 0530-0615, 16 Dec 53; they could not.

"4. The above report is being forwarded for your information. Should further interest be expressed by higher headquarters, this office is prepared to render any assistance possible.

2. The above is being submitted for whatever action you may deem appropriate. No further action in this matter will be taken by 4th GSI District unless a request from competent authority for action is received.
