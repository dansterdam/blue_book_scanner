1. A study has been completed of the Coast Guard negative of unknown aerial objects. A full report to describe the steps in this study will be sent to you in a short time. Until it is completed, this brief summary will contain the findings of the Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory.

2. The central point in question is the apparent brightness of the 4 objects coupled with the total absence of any corresponding highlights or reflections of these objects from the automobiles in the picture. The brightness of these objects would appear to be of the same order of magnitude as the reflections of the sun in the chromium bumpers and trim of the automobiles. This is indicated by the enclosed prints in Series A, numbered on the reverse side in pencil, and representing: A-1 is normal print exposure time, A-2 is double this exposure time, A-3 is four times, and A-4 is eight times.

3. Further examination of the Series A prints shows no trace of highlights on the automobiles caused by the objects. All bright spots that can be seen are directly related to the sun, which is to the rear and to the left of the camera position. There are, however, surfaces which should show highlights, eg. the auto directly under the largest object. It is obviously a fairly new car, with average polish to the paint. Yet nowhere on the roof is any suggestion of an overhead illumination directly from the object.

4. This point has been tested experimentally in the Series B and C prints. A standard studio photoflood lamp was placed above and some 50 ft beyond a row of parked automobiles beside the Photographic Reconnaissance Laboratory. A camera was set up on an elevated platform, about 200 ft from the central auto in the photograph, indicating by the photoflood lamp directly above it. The Series B prints show the cars with the lamp turned off, while the Series C prints show the same scene with the lamp on. An unmistakable bright line highlight can be seen in the car appearing directly under the lamp, a highlight which can be seen when the lamp is off. A similar bright line should be seen somewhere on the top of the car in Series A prints, had distant bright objects been actually located as indicated.

5. Series D prints show how easy it is to construct a hoax by means of double exposure. The glowing objects, hovering over the Photographic Reconnaissance Laboratory, are multiple exposures of a single street lamp, extension type. The film was multiply exposed at night, with a dark view field surrounding the lamp. The daytime exposure of the building was carefully oriented to produce the aerial hovering effect. However, the fraud is indicated because no highlights may be seen in the auto roofs. (The possibility of building shading in Series D is not existent in Series A).

6. It is therefore concluded that the authenticity of the picture, taken by the Coast Guard photographer, is open to serious doubt.

UFO SIGHTING
SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS
16 July 1952

On 16 July 1952 a photograph of four objects was taken by the USCG station photographer at Salem, Massachusetts. The photograph was submitted to ATIC for analysis and the analysis was completed on 1 Aug 52. Analysis was made from the original negative which was returned to the Coast Guard at their request. The results of this analysis indicated that the photo was a hoax. Extensive photographs were taken under similar conditions. Failure of the light source to cast reflections on the highly polished cars below indicated that the light was not outside and it was assumed by the analyst at the time, that the photo was a double exposure and for this reason was a hoax. A subsequent examination of this photo was made in October 1963 and the following analysis is indicated as a more probable cause.

The photo was taken through a window with a 4/5 Busch Pressman Camera (135 MM F4.7 Raptar lens with Rapax shutter), loaded with 4/5 Super XX cut film). The photographer observed several lights which seemed to be wavering. He observed the lights for 5 or 6 seconds and grabbed the camera, which had been on a nearby table. The focus was adjusted to in-finity. The photographer pulled the slide in preparation for the picture when he noticed that the lights had dimmed. He assumed at the time that the object he saw was a reflection. He ran out of the room to get an additional witness, and upon returning noticed that the lights were again brilliant. When they went to the window the lights were gone. He again stated that perhaps some sort of refraction or ground reflection could possibly account for the lights.

The following points are deemed pertinent to analysis. The camera was focused on infinity and the picture taken through a window. As the witness approached the window the objects dimmed, as he returned to his point of initial observation and at the second observation as he reentered the room the lights were again pulled. The objects as photographed appear fuzzy and out of focus. The cars and buildings outside are sharply outlined. The window frame inside the building is out of focus. All four objects have the same outline and general configuration, in spite of the blurring.

Conclusion: It is believed that the photos represent light reflections from an interior source (probably the ceiling lights) on the window through which the photo was taken. With the camera set on infinity the window would be more out of focus than the lights. The lights will still be out of focus since the distance from the lights to the window and back to the camera lens would still be shorter than the distance required for

Flying Saucers, Disks, or What?
The Camera Catches 4 of Them

[Caption under photo] - United Press Telephoto of Coast Guard Photo

Here's the picture snapped by Coast Guardsman Shell R. Alpert.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 (JP)â Coast Guard Headquarters today made public a photograph of what appears to be four unidentified phenomena taken by a Coast Guard photographer.

The photo clearly shows four round objects. Each appears to have two identical shafts of light extending across its center and protruding at the forward and rear ends. The lights are in a "V" formation.

The Coast Guard said it had no opinion as to the cause of the objects and was releasing the picture only because of the widespread public interest in aerial phenomena.

The picture was snapped by Shell R. Alpert, Salem, Mass.

Air Station photographer, who said he sighted several brilliant, white lights through the Air Station's telescope window at 8 a.m. July 16.

"Alpert watched the lights for five or six seconds before attempting to photograph them," the article continues. "By the time he had focused his camera the lights were reported 'considerably dimmed down.'"

Flying Saucers?âA Coast Guard Photograph

Photograph released by the Coast Guard yesterday made July 16 by Shell R. Alpert at Coast Guard Air Station in Salem, Mass.

Coast Guard Gets Picture of 'Objects' in Sky

'Saucer' in a Parking Lot, Shown in Photo of Four, Prove to Be White Rock

By G. B. Allen

WASHINGTON, Aug. 1.âCoast Guard headquarters today released a picture of "four round objects" or lights snapped when they appeared briefly in the sky near the Salem, Mass., Coast Guard air station at 9:35 a. m. July 16. It said the "phenomenal photograph" was the first daylight "saucer" made. "We want to see these," Coast Guard officials said, but was in no way sponsoring the reality of "flying saucers."

Officials who save the pictures to the press said they vouched only for the fact that the original had been taken by Shell R. Alpert, a twenty-one-year-old Coast Guard photographer, of Denver, in the presence of Thomas Flaherty, of Marshfield, Mass., a hospital man first class at the air station.

The Coast Guard did not say the negative had not been tampered with in any way. "The objects are unidentified," said an official. "We have no explanation of what these 'objects' or lights resemble a safe aircraft battery but said there was no Army or Navy firing range in the vicinity of Salem.

"Saucer" in a Parking Lot

Only after the pictures had been given out did Coast Guard head quarters discover what appeared to be a far more perfect "saucer" than the aerial lights neatly grounded at the edge of a parking lot.

AF Studying
Photograph of
Disk Formation
By JIM G. LUCAS,
Scripps-Howard Staff Writer
WASHINGTON, July 30.âThe
Air Force is checking the authenticity of a photograph purporting to show five flying saucers
in formation over Salem, Mass.

The picture was taken by Coast
Guardsman at Salem last Thursday about 10 a.m. It was flown
to Coast Guard headquarters in
Washington and then turned over
to the Air Force. It is now at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio, where flying saucer
reports are investigated and evaluated. I saw it yesterday in the
office of:

Capt. E. J. Ruppelt, the Air
Force's flying saucer expert, had
it in his brief caseâunmentioned
through a press conference in
which Maj. Gen. John A. Samford, Air Force intelligence chief,
over Washington, Capt. Ruppelt
still had it in his briefcase when
he took a plane for Dayton at
noon today.

Believe What's Proved
In the Salem picture, the flying saucersâif that's what they
areâappear saucer-shaped white objects with wavy edges suspended
in air. If the photograph can be
accepted at face value, it is the
first daylight picture of flying
saucers. Although several photographs have been taken of flying
saucers, all previous pictures of
Air Force invariably have explained them as balloons, meteors or
bursting fireballs.

Although the sky is light in the
photo, the white objects which
may be flying are easily distinguishable. They somewhat resemble, but could not be confused
with, clouds. There are several
buildings in the foreground.

Capt. Ruppelt, who has spent
several years checking and plotting flying saucers, said he has
made no bookwink in his quest
and he believes nothing which
cannot be proved.

He points out that a single photograph was submitted. There was
no negative. That invariably happens, he said. The Air Force has
yet to get hold of a negative of
a flying saucer picture.

Without questioning anyone's
integrity, Capt. Ruppelt said the picture is a fake. He said the alleged saucer-appear to have been
painted in. Their somewhat irregular, wavy edges indicate an
attempt to fake.

"Wouldn't know," Capt. Ruppelt
said, "whether this was part of
his business to look for such
things. I could easily be fooled by
a composite picture."

Won't Get Panicky
Gen. Sanford said he is "convinced in my own mind" that the
saucers reported over Washington
are the result of optical illusions or hallucinations. He
said they are not secret weapons
or machines produced in this
country. He was equally sure they
were not coming from another
country. He discounted the idea
they came from another planet.

Gen. Sanford conceded that a
number of "credible observers"
have reported seeing these "incredible things." He said the Air
Force will continue to check saucer reports "adequate but not
frantic attention."

a clear picture with the lens setting on infinity. The objects outside the building would be in focus. The apparent brightness of the reflection would decrease as the photograph decreased in the window. The initial photo analysis indicating the magnitude of the light and substantiation of fact that the light source was not external is correct. There is no indication of any attempt to pervert a hoax. The photo received is similar to many others taken through windows which have been confirmed as reflections of an interior light source. Had the camera been focused for a shorter distance the outlining of the interior light source would have been sharper. It is believed that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the evaluation of this photo as reflections of internal light sources.

STATEMENT OF UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES OBSERVED AND PHOTOGRAPHED APPROXIMATELY
0935, 16 July, 1952 from photo office window, U. S. COAST GUARD AIR STATION,
Salem, Mass. by Station Photographer:

I was sitting in the Photo Office filing negatives with my back toward the
window when I turned slightly in the direction of the window and noticed
something bright outside. I observed the sky and saw what appeared to be
several bright - almost brilliant - lights slightly on the starboard side
of the power plant area smoke stacks. I could not determine:

1- Size of lights
2- Number of lights
3- Altitude of lights
4- Sound, if any
5- Speed of lights, if any
6- Direction of lateral or vertical motion
7- Shape of lights

The color temperature of the lights was a high number of Kelvin degrees -
extremely brilliant and white. They seemed to be wavering, but I am not
certain of this. I observed these lights for possibly 5 or 6 seconds
and then turned to a 4/5 Busch Pressmah Camera (135 MM Fl./7 Raptar
lens) with a Paxar shutter, loaded with 4/5 Super XX film). I had this
camera on the desk in order to clean the lens and was not certain there
was film in it. I adjusted the focusing scale roughly to infinity, pulled
the slide and pressed to shoot the picture when I noticed the lights were
considerably dimmed down. I assumed that what I had seen was merely some
sort of reflection, but I rushed out of the lab into the Sick Bay and got
the film. HM to come back to the window with me. As I entered the
office, I noticed that the lights were again burning brightly and without
saying anything to him I dived for the camera and hit the shutter.
After which I told him to look out and as he and I did there was a momentary
flash and we could no longer see any lights. I developed the film which
was exposed at about 1/50th second, f 4.7; in Dokol 1:1 for about 3 3/4 minutes,
the developing agent immediately at hand. After I had fixed and washed the
negative, I took it to CDR. XO for his examination.

It was an extremely hot day and I think that perhaps some sort of refraction
of ground reflections could possibly have accounted for the lights, but in
my estimation this is an improbable explanation. The lens was quite dirty
and so was the window screen. I cannot in all honesty say that I saw objects
or aircraft, merely some manner of lights.
