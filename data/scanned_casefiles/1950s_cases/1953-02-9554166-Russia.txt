The following sightings were made in Russia from November 1952 to 20 February 1953:

1) During the nights of 19 & 20 Nov and again on 8 & 12 Dec 52 unusual optical phenomena in the form of lights were observed in northern Russia. The objects changed color from red to white to green and were observed high in the sky pursuing an elliptical course. On one occasion one of the objects was observed ascending into the air centered in several light beams directed vertically upward. Later the beams of light disappeared and the object, giving off light signals, remained in the air.

2) On 6 Dec 52 a cigar shaped object flew at tremendous speed from a northeasterly direction toward observers, ascending in the sky as it pursued its course.

3) On 20 Feb 53 between 1920 and 1950 hours a lighted object was observed rapidly ascending and descending and at the same time moving slowly southward. Object appeared first round and then cigar shaped, its light changed from red to green, and its southward progress during the half-hour observation period was not more than 100 degrees.

ATIC COMMENT: It is believed that many of these sightings are the result of Soviet balloon activity. The Taurid or Geminis meteor showers might account for the second sighting.

3) On 20 Feb 53 between 1220 and 1250 hours a lighted object was observed rapidly approaching and then slowed and first round and then cigar shaped. Its light changed from red to green, and its southward progress during the half-hour observation period was not more than 100 degrees.

ATIC COMMENT: It is believed that many of these sightings are the result of Soviet balloon activity. The Taurid or Geminid meteor shower might account for the second sighting.
