ATIC DOCUMENT 12379, Russia

The following sightings were made in Russian from November 1952 to 20 February 1953:
1) During the nights of 19 & 20 Nov and again on 8 & 12 Dec 52 unusual optical phenomena in the form of lights were observed in northern Russia. The objects changed color from red to white to green and were observed high in the sky pursuing an elliptical course. On one occasion one of the objects was observed ascending into the air centered in several light beams directed vertically upward. Later the beams of light disappeared and the object, giving off light signals, remained in the air.
2) On 6 Dec 52 a cigar-shaped object first appeared from a northwestern direction toward observers ascending in the sky as it pursued its course.
3) On 20 Feb 53 between 1920 and 1950 hours a lighted object was observed rapidly ascending and descending and at the same time moving slowly southward. Object appeared first round and then cigar shaped, its light changed from red to green, and its southward progress during the half-hour observation period was not more than 100 degrees.

ATIC COMMENT: It is believed that many of these sightings are the result of Soviet balloon activity. The Taurid or Gemind meteor showers might account for the second sighting.

The following sightings were made in Russian skies between 19 November 1952 to 25 February 1953:

1) During the nights of 19 to 20 December 1952, an aircraft was observed the sky over Moscow on 3 or 4 occasions. The aircraft appeared to be of unusual optical performance. On one occasion the aircraft was observed descending into the clouds and was not seen again.

2) On 5 January 1953, three or four objects were observed in the sky for a period of about 10 minutes. The objects appeared to be luminous and remained in one spot during the time they were observed.

3) On 20 February 1953 between 1720 and 1930 hours, 3 or 4 objects were observed rapidly ascending and descending over the Moscow area. It was reported that the objects appeared to be luminous and remained visible for 15 to 20 minutes.

ATIC COMMENT: It is believed that many of these sightings are the result of Soviet balloon activity. The rapid or unusual maneuvering observed might account for the second sighting.
