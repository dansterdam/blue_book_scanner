The objects appeared in a group of 50 to 75. They were of a grayish-white metallic nature and disc-like in shape. The objects were in a circular formation, the whole formation covering an area approximately 12 miles in diameter at an altitude of 20,000 feet. They were not spaced in any particular geometrical manner or seemed to form a comparatively equal distance between each other.

There was no sound emitted and the speed of the group was not estimated. There was no trail or exhaust and the type of propulsion was not known.

At regularly spaced intervals of time, which were estimated to have been between 12 and 15 seconds, over these objects would make a 90 degree turn, talk from one side to the other on a horizontal axis flashing in exact unison.

The flash of this lateral abrupt movement was not continuous. The motion appeared to be one of the class of a venturial glide which rocked up and down horizontally. After the first few (3) minutes of observation the cluster of objects seemed to loosen in number in the center of the circle while becoming more dense on the outer rim.

From their original position, 300 to 400 above the horizon in the northwest, the objects were first sighted, they moved upward in the horizon about 85 and approximately 135 to 155 horizontally. During the entire observation time of about 15 to 18 seconds, the objects moved laterally in a cluster of 12 to 15 seconds, moving away from the observer at the approximate angle of observation this observation was made at Temple, Texas.

The cluster of objects were first sighted by the observer on 5 April 1952 at 1850 hours and were in the observation for 15 seconds. The formation was estimated to have been approximately 15 or 25 miles away at an elevation of 300 to 400 above horizon.

The geographical coordinates of the observers location are 319, 04' ---017, 24' and 231 degrees from true north. This is the approximate location of Grayson - Miller AFB at Temple, Texas.

The weather at the time of the observation was as follows: clear with 15 mile visibility - 8 MPH wind from southward - temp. 58° with clear skies.

There were no unusual meteorological activities or conditions at the time of sighting, nor were there any frame of reference or visual evidence other than a possible drawing of the formation in flight which has been photographed for use as an inclosure.
