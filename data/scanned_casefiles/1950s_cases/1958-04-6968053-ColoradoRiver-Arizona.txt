At the request stated in this letter, I have reviewed what I can of the related data. I believe I can confirm much of what you indicate in your letter of 6 January 1958.

This letter is in response to a prior request/inquiry. The contents include eyewitness accounts and descriptions related to potential unidentified aerial phenomena observed in the Colorado River area of Arizona.

The letter discusses details such as the date, time, and nature of the sightings, as well as the reactions and interpretations of the observers. It also mentions ongoing investigations and efforts to gather more information and evidence about the reported incidents.

Unfortunately, some key details in the letter have been redacted or obscured, likely to protect sensitive information or the identities of those involved. Nevertheless, the letter provides a glimpse into the types of reports and investigations that were part of Project Blue Book and the study of unidentified flying objects during that period.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The document is a "HEAD ROUTING SLIP" that includes information about an incident involving a "fireball" sighting on April 17, 1958. The document also mentions that a questionnaire was sent to the person involved in the sighting, who reported seeing a cylindrical object executing "right-angle turns".

Text extracted from the document:

Dear Mr.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center agrees that your sighting of 17 April 1958 was a fireball.

On the evening of 17 April 1958, witnesses observed the sighting of a cylindrical object exceeding the speed of sound and traveling in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be emitting sparks and exhibited a glowing red or orange color. It was observed for several minutes and gradually disappeared to the north.

Based on the information provided, this was undoubtedly the reentry of a space vehicle or missile, possibly a meteorite. This object has been completely investigated by the Air Technical Intelligence Center, and they have concluded that this was not an Unidentified Flying Object.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
