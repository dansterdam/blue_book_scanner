[Letterhead/Date: 9 DEC 1958]

Delmar E Anderson
Lt Col U S Air Force
Pentagon

Sir:

At this belated date I write to thank you kindly for your good letter of 7 mar 1958.

31 January 1958, to the Air Adjutant General, requesting mission to land in B-3. As you will know, we did not so do.

This letter is on the other points, unrelated to above.

Point 1 on 16 mar 1958, while on duty as geographer for the U S Geological Survey, at the mouth of Eagle Creek in the mile deep Grand Canyon, the following noted notable:

"1 October ? 17 Mar. 9:05"
"Most brilliant one (celestial) five seen in a lifetime - more bright-white than any other coloration. (Perhaps, trace of British red)

One was tracked by great or sudden brilliance, noted to move - as if from near due West to about S/SW (calling at approx 15 to 25 degrees angle to horizon). Was sighted to 15° above horizon, then down dim (plane-). (HQ called quick attention to the fireball to HQ, the saw it a portion of seconds (1 or 2) at its most brilliant)."

Did we observe an official meteor, or satellite section?

Point 2 about 6 weeks ago, [redacted] US Geological Survey - Richfield to Provo, Utah noted [rest of text obscured/redacted]
