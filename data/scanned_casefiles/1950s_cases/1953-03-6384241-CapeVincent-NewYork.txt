And now to the 2nd batch; of 26 March 53:

In the 2nd batch, only 2 are Venus: 13 (Marthasville) and 15 (Cape Vincent) March. There is a possibility that also the 15 March, Conway, was the star Sirius. Most interesting to me is March 18, Williams AFB. This one could be a Menzel mirage. Would be interesting to know elevation above horizon. Would be interesting to have questionnaire filled out on this one. I of the heading had 270° instead of 90°, these might very well have been Sundogs. My guess is, however, that this was some sort of meteorological phenomena.

Now as to the remainder, the 23 March Casper could have been a meteor if the reported 2 minutes is in error. Now large was the disk? Does altitude here refer to elevation? That is your opinion of this one?

The 15 March Courtlands could have been a meteor. The short time of observation seems to make follow-up not worthwhile.

The 19 March Newfoundland case is very interesting, but only one observer. The Fort that the measured ceiling was 2700 feet put his mix to height. Were there any witnesses? If so, this would be worthwhile following up.

The 18 March Great Falls, Mont., gives us another Nocturnal Meandering Light. Can a balloon be ruled out? I think a questionnaire here would be appropriate. Maybe you ought to station a special observer at Great Falls.

The 19 March Tanawanda has insufficient data. The 21 March Elmira is quite interesting but observed only a few seconds. I don't see how Menzel can explain this one.

The 13 March Maxwell AFB has insufficient evidence.

Finally, the 15 March Greenville, could be a balloon.

In both batches there are 3 cases I should personally like to follow up. Those are Shaw AFB, 5 March; Wms AFB 18 March; and 18 March Great Falls.

My plan, Lieutenant, is to concentrate on relatively few cases that show promise of affording scientific data. I purposely want to keep the number of cases down for xmm obvious reasons of time limitations. If it becomes possible to obtain the services of one full time assistant, then I could assign certain follow up jobs which would facilitate matters a great deal.

I hope we can discuss these and other matters at your visit here 22 April.

Best Wishes,

Sincerely,
[Signature: Allen Hynek]

P.S. Any further word on the Fort Austin Case of 17 Feb?
I should appreciate talking with Dr. Kaplan concerning the Menzel plan.
