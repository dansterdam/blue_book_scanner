2. DETAILS: TWO CHICAGO POLICEMEN, ACTING AS GROUND OBSERVERS, WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 60 SECONDS AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE CHICAGO AREA. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING VERY BRIGHT, HAVING A DEEP REDDISH-ORANGE COLOR, AND TRAVELING AT A VERY RAPID SPEED AND APPARENTLY DESCENDING.

REFERENCE: Your ATIC 20J No. 10000

Director of Special Investigations: 
Report of Investigation submitted by MI and AEC for your information and files.

RESUME: Five (5) reports of unidentified fluorescent flying objects south of Chicago, 29 July 1952 were received. Individuals reported observing the objects for periods of 10 to 15 minutes.

1. DESCRIPTIVE: Objects appeared to be flying at high altitudes and showed no definite shape. Pilots reported seeing them on four occasions but could not approach close enough to obtain accurate descriptions. They were observed to be capable of a high rate of speed and able to change direction abruptly. The only thing certain about the objects is that they were very bright - no estimated size or other physical characteristics are available except that they were observed visually for relatively long periods.

2. ACTION: Two (2) copies of instant report being forwarded directly to your office. This report is the result of an investigation conducted over the week-end by representatives from this office, together with officials from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.
