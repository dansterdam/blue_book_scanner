Here is the text from the document:

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the western sky these evenings is the planet Venus, now at greatest brilliance, a bright evening star of some magnitude.

What you see is the planet Venus, now ranking as perhaps the most prominent planet or "star" seen in the evening sky early in 1956.

You can see it by looking low in the west just after sunset. If you know where to look, you can even see it in broad daylight.

After it passed behind the sun last April, Venus has gradually been drawing farther and farther from the sun in its daily move across the sky, and to remind you of its position after the sun had set. On Nov. 18 it will be farther east of the sun, hence remaining visible for the longest time after sunset. Nearly three hours. After that it will start moving toward the sun again.

Because of its early setting, Venus does not appear on the accompanying map of the sky after 10:00 p.m. Your own kind of standard time, at the first of November, 7:00 p.m. on the 15th and 8:30 p.m. on the 30th.

Bright Birds in the Sky

These maps do, however, show the stars that are now visible.

Toward the west is Deneb, at the top of the "Northern cross" which is really part of the constellation Cygnus. Below Deneb is the bird's tail; in fact, the word Deneb represents "tail." The constellation represents the wings, and the lower part of the cross has long been stretched from the first magnitude star Vega in the constellation Lyra to another second magnitude star on the astronomical maps.

Below Deneb, you can see the four brightest stars of the constellation Pegasus, the winged horse. Although these are not among the first magnitude stars, they are bright enough to make them a good starting place for learning the star groups.

The chart is the upper right, therefore, is oriented as though you were facing south.

Not in Pegasus at all, but in the neighboring group of Andromeda. This constellation represents the Ethiopian princess, who, according to mythology, was chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea monster, rescued by the hero Perseus, and placed among the stars by the south. Fortunately, she was rescued by the hero, Perseus, who is seen in the northwest.

Andromeda's mother, Cassiopeia, is seen just above the map, forming the letter W, above Polaris, the pole star. Alongside her is her husband, the king, Cepheus.

Turning now toward the east, we can see what is generally considered to be the finest constellation in the sky, making its debut far east.

Orion Becomes Finest

This is Orion, the warrior, early rising because of the three stars in a row that form his belt. To the left is Betelgeuse, so bright both of the first magnitude, although being one of the very first to rise as they do in the report, and only those that catch up to him.

[The rest of the text continues but is partially cut off or illegible]

At the bottom of the page, there is a note about "SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS" but the details are not fully visible.

The document includes two star charts/maps showing various constellations and their positions in the sky.

2) November 13, 1957, 8:40 a.m.: a "tremendous" sonic boom "crashed" over
Greenfield; Mr. _____ house was violently "hit". An hour before this (he was told
later), at 7:15 a.m., two Greenfield residents saw a very brightly silvery disk below
the moon; it moved upward, diagonally across the face of the moon, turned from silver
to "bluish-pink", and suddenly disappeared. (It is extremely rare for a UFO to be
reported in connection with a sonic boom at all, and in the present case the time sequence may be entirely without significance, Mr. _____ points out, and we agree.)
