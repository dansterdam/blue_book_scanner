AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Intelligence Officer
5276h    Group, APO 929

Report No.
TR-6-52

1. Description of Object: A far away star-like light that changed from a deep orange glow to a pale yellow glow that continued to illuminate and re-appear over a few minutes. (approximately 2 to 3 minutes). Altitude of object was approximately 20,000 feet and at a distance of 1 to 20 miles from Koji 1/F (Koji). During observation, object appeared to increase and decrease in altitude at frequent intervals. When first observed visual visibility was gradually losing altitude and disappeared from observation in a relatively direction (270°). There was no distinguishable trail.

2. Time of Sighting: Object was sighted at 1650/1 and remained in view at intervals until 1655/1. Total time of sighting was 25 minutes.

3. Manner of Observation: Was visual (binoculars 7/6) by five airmen from Koji 1/F and one airman from Seburi Yama 1/F.

4. Location of Observation: Five airmen observed object at Koji 1/F (Koji) and Seburi Yama 1/F (approximately 2,200 in relation to site), at an estimated altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The next observation point was at Seburi 1/F. At Seburi Yama 1/F object was at approximately 1° in relation to site with no estimated distance or altitude.

5. Identifying Information of Observers: No reliability of the observation can be made by these airmen. Fairly good experience in visual observation such as MiG, but their detailed statements, including 3 D, are coincide.

6. Weather: As reported by Seburi Yama 1/F the weather was clear with wind at approximately 20 to 30 miles and scattered clouds at 10,000 feet. Visibility: good.

7. Other Activity That Might Account For Sighting: See comments paragraph 11.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Interceptive Identification: Attempted, negative results.

10. Air Traffic: Two F-94's attempted intercept.

11. Comments: Information in this report indicates object was possibly a star or water balloon, since there was no electronic tracking. No ground station in the Southern Defense Area during this period can identify this object. It was not identifiable. Statement covering period of tracking is included as additional information that could possibly have a bearing on sighting. Reference is made to 1st Lt. Leupold, 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, for explanation of light reflecting controls and reasons for unidentified object.

PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES

On the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty on the 1700 to 0000 shift as D/F operator at Moji D/F, I witnessed and reported a strange light transmission on 110.10 UCS from a pilot to my controller. I heard a transmission on 110.10 UCS from a pilot to my controller. The pilot reported a strange light with no searchable as changing color and disappearing and reappearing. He suggested to my controller that this light be investigated. At this point I made a visual inspection with field glasses of the area around my station. ...while in the process of scanning my immediate sector I noticed to the southwest on a bearing of approximately 250° a glowing object. I kept my glasses on this object for approximately two minutes and at a reduced local altitude and then increase in altitude. It seemed to change shape very little and it continued to be approximately 20,000 feet in altitude. At this point I called my maintenance man A/2c W. Smith who was on duty in that maintenance section just below the D/F section. He viewed the object that I sighted out to him. He reported the same sighting which I explained previously in this statement. At approximately four or five minutes after the aircraft sighting report I reported to my controller my sighting at location. At the same time three men from my station witnessed the object. In the next few minutes three men from my station witnessed the object also with me. The object was located in altitude and was approximately on a bearing of 200° from my station. It seemed to be about 15 to 20 miles from our station. The object seemed to be changing colors again, from a deep orange or reddish glow to a color or yellowish glow. I reported this to my controller giving the bearing of 4000 feet to my station. The object continued to be visible from our station and at 1920 I received a very faint, queery modulated circuit from the operator at Fukuoka D/F asking me if this same object was visible. I replied in the affirmative and he told me that it was now visible from his station. The D/F operator from Fukuoka D/F reported seeing the object, to the controller. The object remained visible until 1855 it disappeared. Behind a mountain to the west of our station. We continued to listen on 110.10 UCS to transmissions between aircraft which was following the object and our controller. This is all I have to report on our sightings from this station.

JOHN P. HYMES
A/2c, USAF

On October 27, 1952 at approximately 1850/1, airmen Hayes, Johnson and I were at the D/F tower after being called by A/2c Hymes, the D/F operator on duty who said that he had sighted an unidentified object. I closed to the roof of the D/F tower, there at approximately 200 from our station appeared a bright shining object of yellow color. This light seemed to be moving and changing from a yellow light to a white light. Every few minutes this light would disappear together and then come on very bright again. This object was approximately 15° to 20° above the horizon with a clear atmosphere. (Continued on next page) ...the last few saw of the light was at approximately 1855 when I returned to the barracks.

I had just arrived in supply at approximately 1830, about one or two minutes later I heard a commotion coming up the steps toward the E/F tower. I inquired to Richard Doughty and George Hayes, both D/F operators what was going on. When we arrived at the tower, we saw a flying object approximately 280° from this station, about 10 to 15 miles. It appeared to be a star-like object hovering for a while in one spot and then up and down, giving off a bright, orange color which dimmed and became bright again. It moved up and down approximately in the same area of the first sighting. About 155 this object just disappeared.

EDDIE L. JOHNSON
S/Sgt, USAF

On the night of the 27 October 1952, I, A/3c George E. Hayes, was witness to an unusual sighting appearing in the sky. It appeared approximately 1830/1, I viewed a bright red glow in the sky. It was a circular object and it seemed to move back and forth, and up and down, at various intervals. The object would go dim and then reappear again. I am unable to say at what altitude it was as it was a great distance from this station. I climbed upon the top of the D/F block and said object with field glasses. It lasted for about thirty minutes and then disappeared. My witness for this observation are S/Sgt E. L. Johnson, A/2c J. P. Hynes, A/3c R. L. Doughty, and A/3c W. J. Smith. I can truthfully say this object was not a star.

GEORGE E. HAYES
A/3c, USAF

On the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty in the radio maintenance section of A/3c John A/3c Wm. F. Smith called me up to the D/F tower and brought my attention to a strange object at approximately 200° from this station. As I remember it, the object at first looked sort of oblong with a very bright glow. I watched this through field glasses as it began to fade out and finally disappeared out of sight. I was about 20 miles east and about 20,000 feet. Of course it is hard to judge distance and height at night. A few minutes later this location. A few minutes later the object appeared again from the same direction. Only this time it did not seem so bright but sort of dim color. It seemed to be changing from an orange to a lighter color sort of bright yellow. From the time it appeared to the second time it gradually broke to lose altitude and finally disappeared behind the mountain west of this station.

PAGE 5 OF 4 PAGES

On the night of October 27, 1952 at approximately 12:55/, I spotted an object on a bearing of approximately 16 degrees from this station which is Seburi-Jama D/F. Moji D/F had reported sighting an object shortly before around this vicinity so I took a pair of binoculars and started searching the sky in that direction. Fifteen to twenty minutes later I spotted the object I reported coming almost directly toward me. It was impossible to judge the speed to any degree of accuracy. It did seem to be moving quite rapidly however. The object was a very small white light and seemed to be around a quarter or so miles away. To my knowledge user was not trail, exhaust or sound coming from the object. It continued toward this station or approximately the same line as it was seen just disappearing. When I say it was coming toward this station, do not get the idea that it was any where near here as it was quite a distance away.

I spotted it with a pair of 7/50 binoculars while I was standing just outside the D/F shack near Facility Charts of September 15, 1952, the exact latitude and longitude of this station is 33 degrees 58 minutes North, 130 degrees 29 minutes East. The weather was clear with winds maybe 20 to 30 miles an hour and scattered clouds in approximately 10,000 feet. I did not see any aircraft in this vicinity or the object came as I have no physical evidence of my sighting, as for my experience as an observer, I have had little. All I can say is that I did see the object. It came in this direction for about fifteen seconds and then disappeared. I took no drawing or sketch to indicate the object was a great a distance to make out any details.

The above report is a statement of what I saw on the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty here at Seburi-Jama D/F.

D/I FEAF COMMENT: On IR-6-52

1. The following comments apply to 314th Troop Carrier Group B K101 and 43rd
Air Division (DEF) IR-3-52 (originally published as 66th Interceptor Squadron
TR 1-52, as referred to in Comment by the preparing officer of this report), as
all three reports refer to the same incident.

2. The three reports give conflicting information as to the location and
description of the light. The following conditions have been noted:

a. The Rawinsonde balloon was launched at 1753/I, from Itazuke Air Base, 
climbing at 38,000 feet, drifting to a point 10-12 miles west of Itazuke by 1841/I.

b. The night was fairly clear, with stars visible in all directions, 
scattered clouds were reported at various altitudes. In TR-3-52, 43rd Adj. 
Lt. Getchell states that light was last seen through a haze layer and changing color.

c. Information received from the Navy Liaison Officer, Hq FEAF, indicates 
that there is considerable cloud activity in those waters at all hours, with a first 
replacement area of greatest activity at 30-40 miles East of Pohang (F-3) Korea. 
Lights might be used throughout this general area at any time.

d. After the initial C-119 sightings, the other personnel were actually 
looking for, and expecting an unusual light.

e. The initial sighting was to the East of Pohang, Korea; the other sight-
ings were in an area extending North'wrd West from Itazuke Air Base to a point near 
Shad intersection.

3. Description of the object and its actions vary widely:

a. The C-119 sightings suggest the appearance of a ceiling light being 
flashed from a surface vessel to check cloud bases. In CACU weather searchlight 
base are often visible, and the rapid ascent of the "C-119's" could easily be the beam 
spot moving from a lower cloud patch to the higher clouds.

b. The F-94 sightings suggest the appearance of stars or distance surface 
lights seen through varying atmospheric conditions. Scattered patches of clouds and 
a shifting haze layer could cause the light to appear to move and change their soli 
and appearance.

c. The sightings from the D/F stations suggest the appearance of a lighted 
weather balloon, flickering and shifting as it rose.

4. Times and locations of sightings compare closely enough to assume that 
different observers did spot something in this area; however, different objects 
have been interpreted as one because of varying location of observers.

a. Weather observers, while following a balloon with a theodolite, will 
occasionally find that they have unknowingly shifted the track from the balloon to 
a star or similar light. Similar circumstances are possible in this incident as well.

following:

a. Weather balloons.
b. Searchlight.
c. Lights on distance surface vessels.
d. Stars.

314th Trp Carr Gp (M)     Y 101     2     3     PAGE 1

On October 27th, 1951, while on a routine airlift mission C-119 #9151 62nd Troop Carrier Squadron, 314th Troop Carrier Group, piloted by Captain Charles R. Lospkey, 1709414, sighted an unidentified flying object 30 miles South southeast of K-3. The aircraft was flying VFR at 9,000 feet on a heading of 160 degrees, at an indicated air speed of 156 knots.

The object was sighted directly to the left and slightly below the C-119, at an estimated distance of 10-40 miles.

It was described as being a very bright, white light, having no visible form or configuration. One crew member described it as similar to a star, only larger and much brighter. The light appeared as bright as a parachute flare, according to another member of the crew. All testified that it wasn't a beam of light and that there was no exhaust trail or elongation of the light. It remained round in shape.

After being under observation for 4-5 minutes by all members of the crew, the object suddenly ascended at a very rapid rate to an estimated altitude of 18,000 - 24,000 feet. The weather at this point was clear, with thin clouds at approximately 20,000 feet and visibility unlimited. The stars were visible. The rate of ascent was not estimated but it appeared very fast relatively.

After ascending, the object started a number of gyrations, changing altitude and direction very rapidly, but still remaining to the left of the aircraft. At this point, the pilot notified JADF by radio.

Five minutes out of SIAL intersection (FN 5057) a similar object was seen off the right wing of the C-119.

This, too, appeared as a bright, white light. It seemed to be closer than the first object, an estimated 20 miles distant, and the light was much brighter. From the moment the second object was sighted until the C-119 changed course at SIAL, both objects were observed by the crew, one to the left of the aircraft, one to the right.

At SIAL intersection the aircraft turned to a heading of130 degrees and lost sight of the first object then on the left. However, the second object remained to the right of the aircraft until the C-119 went on GCA at Ashiya. (J-1) At no time during the crew's observation did the second object undergo any substantial changes in altitude or direction.

The second object was last seen in the vicinity of Brady AB, FN 3230.

The pilot and other crew members discounted any theory that the lights could be resulted from a cockpit reflection or light. This, though occurred to them during the flight and they checked to make sure it was not a reflection. Also, one of the enlisted men went to the rear of the aircraft and observed the objects through the partitioner doors, to minimize the possibility of internal reflections.

Upon re-interrogation, all crew members reported no change in the basic story outlined above. This reliability of the witnesses is rated as "B" by this Headquarters, since three of the five crew members have flown more than 500 hours, with more than three years flying experience. The pilots, Captain Loepkey, is a regular officer with nine years flying experience, three of it as a combined navigator - radar operator - bombardier, during World War II.

Other crew members included 1st Lt. Gerald G. Bornski, AO 185 8459, co-pilot; S/Sgt James A. Buntin, AF 14 104 064, crew chief; A/2c James L. Willis, AF 23096060, radio operator; and A/2c Leslie T. Walker, AF 14 353 526, student radio operator.

There were no reported meteorological phenomena which might account for this reported sighting.

The sighting was confirmed by the fighter pilot sent up by JADF to intercept the object. This confirmation was overheard by Airman Walker, who was monitoring the fighter frequency on VHF.

PAGE 2 OF 4 PAGES

1. Description of Object: A far away star-like light that changed from a deep orange to a pale yellow glow that continued to disappear and re-appear every few minutes (approximately 2 to 3 minutes). Altitude of object was approximately 20,000 feet and a distance of 10 to 20 miles from Moji D/F (WLD 5755). During observation, object appeared to increase and decrease in altitude at frequent intervals. The object remained visible for approximately 25 minutes, gradually losing altitude and disappeared from observation in a westerly direction (270°). There was no distinguishable trail, exhaust or sound from the object.

2. Time of Sighting: Object was sighted at 1650/1 and remained in view at intervals until 1855/1. Total time of sighting was 25 minutes.

3. Manner of Observation: Was visual (Binoculars 7/50) by five airmen from Moji D/F and one airman from Seburi Yama D/F (WLD 2226).

4. Location of Observer: Five airmen observed object at Moji D/F (WLD 5755) and one airman at Seburi Yama D/F (WLD 2226). At Moji D/F, object was sighted at approximately 5500 in relation to site, at an estimated distance of 10 to 20 miles from site and at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The next observation indicated a decrease in altitude and a bearing of approximately 280° in relation to Moji D/F. at Seburi Yama D/F object was at approximately 160° in relation to site with no estimated altitude.

5. Identifying Information of Observers: The reliability of the observation made by these airmen is very good, although they have had little experience in a visual observation such as this, but their detailed statements, Inclosure 1, 2, and 3 do coincide.

6. Weather: As reported by Seburi Yama D/F the weather was clear with winds at approximately 20 to 30 miles and scattered clouds at 10,000 feet. Moji D/F reported same weather.

7. Other Activity That Might Account for Sighting: See comments, paragraph 11.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Interception or Identification: Attempted, negative results.

10. Air Traffic: Two F-94's attempted intercept.

11. Comments: Information in this report indicates object was possibly a scar or weather balloon, since there was no electronic contact made by ground stations in the Southern Defense Area during this period. This was not conclusive. A statement covering period of report is also included from Detachment 6, 20th Weather Squadron, APC 929-2 as additional information that could possibly have a bearing on sighting by ground observers. Reference IR-1-52, 660th Interceptor Squadron, for additional information of light refraction controls and weapons of F-94 as stated by A/3C R. L. Doughty (Incl #1).

On the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty on the 1730 to 0000 shift as D/F operator at Moji D/F, I witnessed and reported a strange light to the southwest of my station. While working my shift I heard a transmission on 116.10 NCS from a pilot to his controller.

The pilot reported a strange light while he described as changing color and disappearing and reappearing. He suggested to my controller that this light be investigated. At this point I made a visual inspection, with field glasses, of the areas around my station. While in the process of scanning my immediate sector I noticed to the southwest on a bearing of approximately 250° a glowing object. I kept my glasses on the object for approximately 20 minutes. The object seemed to change shape very little and it continued to dim and glow at frequent intervals. The object seemed to be approximately 20,000 feet in altitude. At this point I called my maintenance man A/2c W. T. Smith who was on duty in the maintenance section. Just below the D/F section, he viewed the object that I pointed out to him. He reported the same sighting which I explained previously in this statement.

Approximately four or five minutes after the aircraft sighting report I reported to my controller my sighting of the object. This was at 1952. At 1953 the object disappeared from our sight. In the next few minutes three men from my station witnessed the object. Along with myself and myself, I had decreased in altitude and was approximately on a bearing of 250° from my station. It seemed to be approximately 15 to 20 miles from this station. The object seemed to be changing colors again, from a deep orange or reddish glow to a pale or yellow glow. I reported this to my controller giving the bearing of 250° from my station. The object continued to be visible from our station and at 1950 I received a call over the frequency modulated circuit from the operator at Fukuoka D/F asking me if I still saw the object. I replied in the affirmative and he told me it was now visible. From this station, the D/F operator at Fukuoka D/F reported seeing the object, to this controller. The object remained visible now from our station at 1855 its altitude disappeared behind a mountain to the west of our station. We continued to listen on 116.10 NCS to transmission between aircraft which was following the object and our controller. This is all I have to report on our sightings from this station.

On October 27, 1952 at approximately 1850/1, Airmen Hayes, Johnson and I rushed to the D/F tower after being called by A/2c Hayes to the D/F operator who said there he sighted an unidentified object. I climbed to the roof of the D/F tower, there at approximately 260° from our station appeared a bright shining object of yellow color. This light seemed to be moving up and down and changing from a yellow light to a white light. Every few minutes this light would disappear altogether and then come on very bright again. This object did not seem to be high because of the bright glow. With 1st Overhaard on 116.10 NCS was an interceptor pilot who said he was at 33,500 feet and this light was affecting his controls, and was, this last I saw of the light was at approximately 1055 when I returned to the barracks.

I had just arrived in supply at approximately 1830, about one or two minutes later I heard a commotion coming up the steps toward the D/F tower. I inquired to Richard Doughty and George Hayes, both D/F operators what was going on. When we arrived at the tower, we saw a slowing object approximately 280° from this station, about 10 to 15 miles. It appeared to be a star-like object hovering for a while in one spot and then up and down, giving off a bright, orange color which dimmed and became bright again. It moved up and down approximately in the same area of the first sighting. This object just disappeared.

EDDIE L. JOHNSON
S/Sgt, USAF

On the night of the 27 October 1952, I, A/3c George E. Hayes, was witness to an unusual sighting in the sky. At approximately 1830/1, I viewed a bright red glow in the sky. It was a circular object and it seemed to move back and forth and up and down at various intervals. The object would go dim and then get bright again. I am unable to say at what altitude it was as it was a great distance from this station. I climbed upon the top of the D/F tower and looked at said object with field glasses. It lasted for about thirty minutes and then disappeared. My witness for this observation are S/Sgt B. L. Johnson, A/2c J. P. Hynes, A/3c R. L. Doughty, and A/3c W. T. Smith. I can truthfully say this object was not a star.

GEORGE E. HAYES
A/3c, USAF

On the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty in the radio maintenance section of Moji D/F, A/2c John Hynes called me up to the D/F tower and brought my attention to a strange object at approximately 280° from this station. As I remember it, the object at first looked sort of dim which at a very bright glow. I watched this through field glasses as it began to fade out and finally disappeared out of sight. I would say the object was from 15 to 20 miles from here and at about 20,000 feet. Of course it is hard to judge distance and height at night and even harder to judge the size. A few minutes later the object appeared again from the same direction only this time it did not seem so bright. It seemed to be changing from an orange to a lighter color sort of bright yellow. From the time it appeared to the time it finally disappeared, it gradually began to lose altitude and finally disappeared behind the mountain west of this station.

PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES

On the night of October 27, 1952 at approximately 1855/1 I spotted an object on a bearing of approximately 16 degrees from this station which is Seburi-Yama D/F. Hoji Naka had reported sighting an object shortly before around his vicinity so I took a pair of binoculars and started searching the sky in that direction. Fifteen to twenty minutes later I spotted the object I reported coming almost directly toward me. It was impossible to judge the speed to any degree of accuracy. It did seem to be moving quite rapidly however. The object was a very small white light and seemed to be round a hundred or so miles away. To my knowledge there was no trail, exhaust or sound coming from the object. It continued toward this station on a horizontal line for about fifteen seconds or less and then just disappeared. When I say it was coming toward this station, do not get the idea that it was any where near here as it was quite a distance away.

I spotted it with a pair of 7/50 binoculars while I was standing just outside the D/F shack near Kadena Control Facility Charts of September 15, 1952, the exact latitude and longitude of this station is 26 degrees 6 minutes north and 127 degrees 43 minutes east. The weather was clear with winds northwest 20 to 30 miles an hour and scattered clouds at approximately 10,000 feet. I did not see any aircraft in the vicinity of the object, and of course I have no physical evidence of my sighting. As for my experience as an observer, I have had little. All I can say is that I did see the object. It came in this direction for about fifteen seconds and then disappeared. The action I took was to report to Picnic, the Central Control Station. I have no drawing or sketch to include as the object was at too great a distance to make out any details.

The above report is a statement of what I saw on the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty here at Seburi-Yama D/F.

AF FORM 112-PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Central Briefing and Interrogation Center, Southern Defense Area, Japan
Date: 9 Oct 52    Page 2 of 3

Detailed Information regarding the unidentified object referred to in Part I of this report is as follows:

1. The object was described by four (4) observers in two (2) separate F-94 aircraft. It Baldwin, Pilot, described the object as a steady bright white to light or light blue, already turning toward 4,000 to 5,000 yards. It Goldman Radar Observer, described the object as a perceptible disk of white light about one-third the size of the moon which occasionally faded in and out. Lt Gotchell and Lt Kovacs saw the object was a star and they are convinced it was a star they saw. In all cases, there was only one object sighted.

2. In all cases there were negative aerodynamic features, negative trail or exhaust, negative propulsion system and negative sound emanating from the object.

3. The "star" that Lt Gotchell and Lt Kovacs observed did not maneuver and remained in view at all times except when their aircraft went behind clouds. The object that Lt Baldwin saw on one occasion disappeared and then later reappeared, on one occasion appeared to be moving laterally and descending in a straight and on one occasion appeared to be making a head on pass on Lt Baldwin's aircraft. It Goldman reported that the object also appeared to be coming head on, but that it faded in and out throughout the entire time of sighting. The final disappearance of the object seen by Lt's Goldman and Baldwin was due to cloud conditions at the time.

4. The object was first sighted by Lt Baldwin and Lt Goldman at 1830I and the object disappeared 45 seconds later. Then two observers sighted the same object in a different position between 18401 and 18451. The duration of their second sighting was several minutes. Lt Gotchell and Lt Kovacs saw the object they were instructed to investigate for an extended period of time, from 1850I to 1950I.

5. All observers saw the object visually and there was negative radar contact, although the radar sets in both aircraft were operative. All observation was from aircraft at speeds ranging from 250 knots to 0.3 mach at altitudes from 19,000 to 35,000 feet.

6. Lt Gotchell and Lt Kovacs observed what they thought to be a star on a bearing of 250° 100 above the horizon while their aircraft was moving from 35° - 41N° and 130° - 190° to approximately 32° - 30N and 128° - 301°. Lt Baldwin and Lt Goldman observed the unidentified point or disk of light while very near a position 34° - 40N and 130° - 191°, and when they were moving South to a position 35° - 41N and 130° - 191°. The object was estimated at altitude from 5,000 to 20,000 feet.

7. During all the sightings there was a scattered cloud layer from 27,000 to 29,000 feet, winds unknown and visibility good, no haze.

8. Negative physical evidence was obtained.

9. An attempt was made by both aircraft to intercept and identify the object, however the close distance between observer and object was estimated to be from 4,000 to 5,000 yards.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

D/F TEAM COMMENT: Ca. 10-6-52

1. The following comments apply to 314th Troop, Carrier Group in K101 and 43rd Air Div. (PA) as referred to in this document by the preparing officer of this report):

a. The Marinerade balloon was launched at 1752/1, from Itazuke Air Base, climbing at 36,000 feet, drifting to a point 10-12 miles west of Itazuke by 1821/1.

b. The night was fairly clear, with stars, visible in all directions.

c. Information received from the Navy Liaison Officer, Hq FEAF, indicates that there are constant replacement areas of constant activity at 30-40 miles East of Pohang (P-3) Korea.

d. After the initial G-119 sighting, the other personnel were actually looking for, and expecting an unusual light.

e. The initial sighting was to the East of Pohang, Korea; the other sightings were in an area extending North and West from Itazuke Air Base to a point near Shimonoseki.

3. Description of the object and its actions vary widely:

- The G-119 sightings suggest the appearance of a ceiling light being flashed from surface vessel to check closed bases. In CAVU weather searchlight seen in "Octors" could easily be the best spot moving from a lower cloud patch to the higher clouds.

- The P-94 sightings suggest the appearance of stars or distant surface lights, seen through haze or cloud. Scattered patches of clouds and a shifting haze layer could cause the lights to appear to move and change their color.

4. Time and location of sightings compare closely enough to assume that different observers did spot something in this area; however, different objects could have been involved.

Further, observers, while following a balloon with a theodolite, will occasionally find that they have unknowingly shifted the track from the balloon to a star or other light. Similar occurrences are possible in this incident as well.

Detailed information regarding the unidentified object referred to in
Part I of this report is as follows:

1. The object was described by four (4) observers in two (2) separate
F-94B aircraft. It Baldwin, Pilot, described the object as a steady bright
white spot of light in an aircraft landing light, turned directly toward
you from 4,000 to 5,000 yards. It Goldman, Radar Observer, described the
object as a possible disk of white light. Both Goldman and Baldwin, one of
the most watch occasionally faded in and out. It Gotchell and it Kovacs said
the object was a star and they are confused in what they saw. In all
cases, there was only one object sighted.

2. In all cases there were negative aerodynamic features, negative
trail or exhaust, negative propulsion system and negative sound emanating
from the object.

3. The "star" that It Gotchell and It Kovacs observed did not maneuver
and remained in view at all times except when their aircraft went behind
clouds. The object then at its Baldwin was on one occasion disappeared and
then later reappeared, on one occasion appeared to be moving laterally and
occasionally in altitude. And on another occasion appeared to be making a
head on pass on It Baldwin's aircraft. It Goldman reported that the object
also appeared to be coming head on, but that it faded in and out throughout
the entire time of sighting. The final disappearance of the object seen
by It's Goldman and Baldwin was due to cloud coverage at the time.

4. The object was first sighted by It Baldwin and It Goldman at 1830I
and the object disappeared 15 seconds later. There two observers again
sighted the same object in a different position between 1840I and 1845I.
The duration of their second sighting was several minutes. It Gotchell
and It Kovacs saw the object they were instructed to investigate for an
extended period of time, from 1850I to 1950I.

5. All observers saw the object visually and there was negative radar
contact, although the radar sets in both aircraft were operative. All
observations were from altitudes between 19,000 and 33,000 feet. Speeds
to 0.5 mach at altitudes from 19,000 to 33,000 feet.

6. It Gotchell had It Kovacs observed what they thought to be a star
on a heading of 250 100 above the horizon while their aircraft was moving
from 35° - N11W and 130° - 30N at 120° - 30N. It Baldwin and It Goldman
at Baldwin and It Goldman observed the unidentified point or disk of light
while they were at a position 360° - N01W and 130° - 22N and when they were
moving South to a position 330° - N41W and 130° - 19N. The object was
estimated at altitude from 5,000 to 20,000 feet.

7. During all the sightings there was a scattered cloud layer from
27,000 to 29,000 feet, winds unknown and visibility good, no haze.

8. Negative physical evidence was obtained.

9. An attempt was made by both aircraft to intercept and identify
the object, however the closest distance between observer and object was
estimated to be from 4,000 to 5,000 yards.

10. There was occasional other air traffic sighted during the period the unidentified object was observed.

11. Comments of the preparing officers: It Getzell and Lt Kovacs are both experienced air crew members combat experienced in World War II and in Korea. Both would be considered competent observers, however, Lt Getzell is included to be over skeptical, a fact which is attested to by his Squadron Commander and his Flight Leader. Lt Baldwin and Lt Goldmann are both very impressed and young officers. They are both impressionable and excitable. This is also the opinion of their Squadron Commander and Flight Leader.

Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by
Second Lieutenant Eugene F. Baldwin, Jr., AO 2 222 906.

Conform Yellow, as F-49B, was airborne on a Combat Air Patrol
at 1710N, 2nd Lt Elkins, Pilot.

Friendly was making practice intercepts on an identified aircraft in the vicinity of OMINO-SHIMA, 340° - 14' N and 130° - 07' E
and BRADY Air Field, 33° - 40' N and 130° - 22' E.

It was still dusk, with Conform Yellow near BRADY Air Field when a Call) called SHIGANO-SHIMA (GCI), 33° - 41' N and 130° - 19' E,
that he was watching a fast-moving, fast-climbing object, and suggested that GCI that the object be investigated. After being informed that Conform Yellow had 45 minutes fuel left, GCI instructed him to investigate.

Friendly climbed to 20,000 feet and flew on a heading of 360° from BRADY Air Field to a point 45 - 50 miles from BRADY. At 1830'r with Friendly at 19,000 feet, Air Speed 260 Knots, an object appeared off the right wing tip. Friendly turned into the object and intended to turn off all his lights. However, pilot inadvertently left on his fuselage light.

At first contact pilot reports the object looked as big as a fighter, 4,000 to 5,000 yards from him. Object looked like a white light, an aircraft landing light turned directly at him from 4,000 to 5,000 yards away.

Friendly was heading 090° and object appeared to be heading directly toward him at an unmistakable speed. Pilot called the Radar Observer and confirmed that it looked like bogies was making a head-on pass. Radar Observer agreed. Then the object disappeared completely and unexpectedly. Time: 1830 to 1845'r.

After object disappeared, friendly turned port and climbed to 24,000 feet. Then pilot thereafter was in error and that the object was a star. Pilot informed GCI that it was a star.

Friendly then made a 180° turn inbound toward TIZURES Air Force Base, 330 - 35' N and 130° - 27' E. Object then reappeared off friendly's right wing. Pilot called GCI and told them that he had a visual on the bogie again that it was not a star.

Friendly turned into the object which got brighter as if it were descending toward Friendly from 200 feet at an estimated speed. Pilot then discovered and turned off the fuselage light. Pilot then reported minimum tail to GCI, turned to a heading of 2600 descending at 6,000 feet per minute to 17,000 feet. Then the friendly turned port heading 210° directly inbound to TIZURES Air Force Base. As friendly turned, the bogie moved to a point 2 o'clock to his position. Bogie disappeared as he moved, yet pilot could not estimate speed or distance.

Pilot called GCI at 1845I and informed them of bogie's position, a relative bearing of 020° from SHIGANO-SHIMA, and 20,000 feet altitude. Pilot asked if GCI had any radar contact with anything in that location. GCI replied they were "painting" something in that general direction.

Friendly was now at 3,000 feet and object moved starboard to 3 o'clock as approximately 5,000 feet altitude.

Conform Green then called Conform Yellow for instructions. Conform Yellow told his the approximate position of the bogie. Conform Green replied that he had visual contact and to Conform Yellow to go between bogie and friendly and continue on a course outbound from the object.

Friendly then landed under an overcast and object disappeared.

The foregoing was a true and complete narrative of the flight of "Conform Yellow from 1740 to 1855" on 27 October 1952.

Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by
Second Lieutenant Harold Goldman, AO 2 223 937.
(This report supplements narrative by 2nd Lt Eugene Baldwin)

Conform Yellow was airborne on a Combat Air Patrol at 1740H.
2nd Lt Goldman, Radar Observer.

Friendly was making practice intercepts on identified aircraft
in the vicinity of OSHIO-SHIMA, 330°- 14' N and 130°- 07' E and
BRAM Air Field, 330° - 40' N and 130° - 22' E.

Just after send intercept friendly was instructed to investigate
unidentified flying object 50 miles north of ASHIYA Air Force Base,
330° - 53' N and 130° - 40' E, at 20,000 feet over call to C-119.

When friendly arrived at a point 50 miles north of ASHIYA, a
bright light was noticed off the right wing at 3 o'clock. Friendly
turned into object. The light faded in and out but appeared to be
coming towards Friendly. There were stars behind the object. Friendly
climbed to 24,000 feet from 19,000 feet and was then positive that the
object was not a star.

Friendly then took up a heading of 210° and object no longer
appeared to be coming head-on. Friendly was descending and object
appeared to be in level flight with a speed greater than Friendly.
C-119 came overhead from direction of bogie between friendly and bogie.
The bogie was observed at all times to fade and reappear.

As friendly was returning to ITAZUKE Air Force Base, 33° - 35' N
and 130° - 27' E, for a landing, bogie appeared to be at 3,500 feet
over SHIRAOKA-SHIMBU, 330 - 41' N and 130° - 19' E and this information
was reported to Conform Green who took over the chase.

The foregoing was a true and complete narrative of the flight of
"Conform Yellow" from 1740 to 1851 on 27 October 1952.

Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by
First Lieutenant Richard B. Getschell, No 1 910 229 and First Lieutenant
Charles A. Kovacs, AO 590 1971

Conform Green, an F-94B, took off at 1850I on a Scramble, 1st
Lt Getschell, Pilot and 1st Lt Kovacs, Radar Observer.

As soon as he was airborne, the Pilot called SHIGANO-SHIMA OCI
(Plotting) 329 - All W and 130° - 19½ W, for instructions. OCI
instructed Conform Green to take up a heading of 360° and call Conform
Yellow for a heading. (Conform Yellow was a previously airborne F-94)

Conform Yellow reported to Conform Green that the object was then
over SHIGANO-SHIMA OCI. Conform Green was then over the BRADY Air
Field Base, 335° - 40' N and 130° - 22' E, and when he received the
instructions from Conform Yellow he looked toward SHIGANO-SHIMA and
saw the bright light reported to as the object. The light was on a
heading of 250° from SHIGANO-SHIMA OCI and 10° above the horizon.
This was reported to OCI who then asked for identification of the
"object".

Conform Green headed 250°-climbing with afterburner to 33,000
feet, "on the mach" all the way, and proceeded to a point estimated
to be 100 miles from SHIGANO-SHIMA. From this position "bogie" was
still 10° above the horizon on a heading of 250° with its size and
brilliance unchanged. At this time (S/OI) Pilot identified "bogie"
as a star. OCI permitted Conform Green to break off and friendly
homed into BRADY Air Field on a heading of 030° at 33,000 feet.

On its way toward BRADY Air Field Conform Green noticed another
bright star 2 o'clock from his position.

OCI then called Conform Green and instructed them to continue
searching. Conform Green continued past BRADY Air Field on a heading
of 030° for 50 miles to the position where the object was first
sighted. While enroute primarily passed over a 29,000 foot broken
overcast which obscured the object for the rest of the flight.

The object was last seen when Conform Green was 30 miles NE
of BRADY Air Field. The objects position was still on a heading of
250° from SHIGANO-SHIMA, with an elevation above the horizon on 5°.

The light was last seen through a thick base layer and was
changing color rapidly.

Pilot continued searching up to 40,000 feet, saw nothing, and
broke off the search at 2010L. Conform Green then proceeded to
ITAZUKE Air Force Base, 33° - 35' N and 130° - 27' E and landed at
2025L.

Pilot and Radar Observer are of the opinion that the object was
a star or other heavenly body.

Amendment to Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by 1st Lt. Charles Kovacs, Radar Observer

Upon picking up the light visually, the Radar Observer attempted to pick up and lock on to the light with the weapon. Although no return was picked up by the weapon, interference appeared in the approximate azimuth of the light when the Radar set was operated on hand control. The pilot reported this to Shigano GCI.

This took place shortly after take off and sighting of the light. The Radar Observer did not have time to check the operation of the set.

After the Pilot and Radar Observer identified the object as a star, the Radar Observer proceeded to check the set. It was found at this time that interference could be produced by moving the hand control rapidly in a small area. This was tested at various elevations and azimuths and the same results were obtained in all cases.

This rapid movement was very similar to the tactics used by the Radar Observer in attempting to pick up the unidentified object.

The foregoing was a true and complete amendment to the narrative of the flight of "Conform Green" from 1830I to 2025I on 27 October 1952.

Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by
Second Lieutenant Eugene T. Baldwin, Jr., AO 2 228 906.

Conform Yellow, an F-94B, was airborne on a Combat Air Patrol
at 17:05, 2nd Lt Baldwin, Pilot.

Friendly was making practice intercepts on an identified air-
craft in the vicinity of OKINO-SHIMA, 340 - 14' N and 130° - 07' E
and BRADY Air Field, 330 - 40' N and 130° - 22' E.

It was still dusk, with Conform Yellow near BRADY Air Field,
when a call called SHIGANO-SHIMA GOH, 330 - 41' N and 120° - 19' E,
that he was watching a fast-moving, fast-climbing object, and sug-
gested to GOH that the object be investigated. After being informed
that Conform Yellow had 45 minutes fuel left, GOH instructed him to
investigate.

Friendly climbed to 20,000 feet and flew on a heading of 3600
from BRADY Air Field to a point 45 - 50 miles from BRADY. At 19,000
with Friendly at 19,000 feet, Air Speed 260 Knots, an object appeared
off the right wing slightly. Friendly turned into the object and intended
to turn off all his lights, however, pilot inadvertently left on his
fuselage light.

At first contact pilot reports the object looked as big as a
fighter 4,000 to 5,000 yards from him. Object looked like a white
light, an aircraft landing light turned directly at him from 4,000
to 5,000 yards away.

Friendly was heading 090° and object appeared to be heading
directly toward him at an unestimated speed. Pilot called the Radar
Observer and explained that he looked like was making a head-on
pass, Radar Observer agreed. Then the object disappeared completely
and unexpectedly. Time: 1830 to 1845T.

After object disappeared, friendly turned port and climbed to
24,000 feet. Then pilot thought the whole incident was in error and
that the object was a star. Pilot informed GOH that it was a star.

Friendly then made a 180° turn inbound toward ITAZUKE Air Force
Base, 330 - 35' N and 130° - 27' E. Object then re-appeared off
friendly's right wing. Pilot called GOH and told them that he had
a visual or the bogie again that it was not a star.

Friendly turned into the object which got brighter as if it were
descending toward friendly from 20° starboard and 20° high at an un-
estimated speed. Pilot then discovered and turned off the fuselage
light. Pilot reported minimum fuel to GOH, turned to a heading of
260 descending at 5,000 feet per minute to 17,000 feet. Then the
friendly turned port heading 210° directly inbound to ITAZUKE Air
Force Base. As friendly turned, the bogie moved to a point 20 o'clock
to his position. Bogie descended as he moved, but pilot could not
estimate speed or distance.

Conform Green, an F-94B, took off at 1850T on a Scramble, 1st
Lt Gatchell, Pilot and 1st Lt Kovacs, Radar Observer.

As soon as he was airborne, the Pilot called SHIGANO-SHIMA OGI
(Picnic) 33° -41' N and 130° -19' E, for instructions. OGI
instructed Conform Green to take up a heading of 360° and call Conform
Yellow for a briefing. (Conform Yellow was a previously airborne F-94)

Conform Yellow reported to Conform Green that the object was then
over SHIGANO-SHIMA OGI. Conform Green was then over the BRADY Air
Field Bomber, 33° -40' N and 130° -22' E, and when the received the
instructions from Conform Yellow he looked toward SHIGANO-SHIMA and
saw the bright light referred to as the bogie. The light was on a
heading or 350° from SHIGANO-SHIMA OGI and 10° above the horizon.
This was reported to OGI who then asked for identification of the
"object".

Conform Green headed 250°, climbing with afterburner to 33,000
feet. From this point all the way, and proceeded to a point estimated
to be 100 miles from SHIGANO-SHIMA. From this position "bogie" was
still 100 above the horizon on a heading of 250° with its size and
brilliance unchanged. At this time (1910L) Pilot identified "bogie"
as a star. OGI reported Conform Green to break off and friendly
homed into BRADY Air Field on a heading of 030° at 33,000 feet.

On its way toward BRADY Air Field Conform Green noticed another
bright star 2 clock from his position.

OGI then called Conform Green and instructed them to continue
searching. Conform Green continued past BRADY Air Field on a heading of 030° for 50 miles to the position where the object was first
sighted. While enroute friendly passed over a 29,000 foot broken
overcast which obscured the object for the rest of the flight.

The object was last seen when Conform Green was 30 miles NE
of BRADY Air Field. The object was still on a heading of
250° from SHIGANO-SHIMA, with an elevation above the horizon of 5°.

The light was last seen through a thick haze layer and was
changing color rapidly.

Pilot continued searching up to 40,000 feet, saw nothing, and
broke off the search at 2010L. Conform Green then proceeded to
ITAZUKE Air Force Base, 33° -35' N and 130° -27' E and landed at
