MEXICO CITY, March 11 (AP)
The director of a Mexican observatory where the photograph was taken, said it was 'only a picture of something round in the sky which could not be identified.'
The photograph was a black square with a diagonal band of light, which the newspaper 'Excelsior' said was "probably the only picture of its kind taken within the larger countries."
Luis Enrique Erro, director of the National Observatory where the photograph was taken, said it was the impression that it could have been the picture of some unknown object flying very high in the sky.
More reports of flying saucers poured into the press from all over Mexico. The incident received nationwide attention and the newspaper printed a series of articles which appeared in three magazines.

Beyond that, the report gets a little confused. The Air Force says it was an
Unidentified Flying Object, but people who saw it claim it was a flying
triangle. If it wasn't a triangle, then what the heck was it? At any rate,
it was a flying object, and the radar at Montrose A.F.B. did pick it up. So,
consequently, there was something there, even if it wasn't a triangle, as
some may have hoped. This, at least, seems certain.'

Mexico City, Mexico

Trained Eyes See 
Mexican Saucers

MEXICO CITY, March 14. - Trained aircraft observers confirmed reports today of hundreds of persons who observed "flying saucers" over this city yesterday and one at Monterrey, 580 miles north. Official observers said they were "far from describing them as saucers but admitting that they were observing phenomena they could not explain."

13,000 to 40,000 Feet Up.
The observers said the objects at the Mexico City airport calculated their altitude at between 33,000 and 40,000 feet. They used weather balloons and tracking instruments to make their reckonings.

An airline weatherman said he "thought the objects he saw were an illusion." However, the chief observer of the Mexican Aviation Company said the case was unexplained.
Mr. Smith watched it through a telescope. "It was there," said Mr. Smith. "It was no illusion."  

Lt. Col. E.J. Ruppelt, a veteran employee of the airport commander's office, said he saw all four of the objects. He said they appeared to be the size of a silver peso. Other observers guessed they were about 100 feet in diameter.

At Monterrey the government inspector Francisco Martinez said he watched a flying body which moved in a zigzag line from southwest to northeast.

He said it was moving at terrific speed and appeared to be about 20,000 feet above him. Petten was flying at 5,000 feet when he noticed the disk below him, he said. As he approached the object, it seemed to go into an "overcast." He said the sight gave off vapor trails like jet aircraft engines.

"Those Flying Discs--

'Saucer-Like' Object
Reported In Alabama

Birmingham, Mar 9 - Sighting of a strange "saucer-like" object in the sky over Alabama was disclosed today by a man and his wife. Military intelligence has been informed of the report and is investigating.

The "saucer" was reported by L. C. Phillips, an employee of the Dupont plant near Louisville, Ky., who was on a visit to his wife's home in Medley-ville.

Phillips reported that he and his wife were riding on a dirt road near Bear Creek when they observed the strange object.

"It was a very pretty sight," Phillips said. "Something like a silver dollar, only much larger. And it was going with a speed that was just incredible."

He said the "saucer" was going up and up at an angle of 45 degrees until it was about the size of a pinhead and then it disappeared. 

"It made a sound like a small motor and had a light bulb," he said, "white with a greenish tinge. It was not making any noise until it was about to land on us, and then it made a humming sound."

Phillips said he and his wife searched the area but were unable to find any trace of the object.

"It was a very pretty sight with following lights and streamers," Phillips said.

There is no military unit stationed at Medley-ville, intelligence officers said, and they are investigating the report of the "Air Force saucer" sighting."

The various LATS units forwarded the following items which appeared in the period 29 March and 17 April 1950:

1. Four observers reported seeing three symmetrical spinning objects which they at first thought to be clouds but then the observers noticed that the objects were not clouds but were traveling at a rapid rate. They all agreed that the middle object disappeared and then returned, then disappeared once again and followed.

2. Reports by civilians that they had sighted three objects, presumably flying saucers, at Autaugaville between 5 and 6 PM the same day. They were described as bright light about the size of the full moon and were flying on a level course. They seemed to be circling. They appeared to change their positions, up and down, and then disappeared from view.

MEXICO CITY, March 14 (/P) - Thousands of residents reported seeing four "flying saucers" yesterday over this city and nearby suburbs. The saucers were seen for more than an hour, but official observers shied away from confirming the existence of the disks.

Meteorologists at the Mexico City Airport said their instruments recorded an unidentified object at 30,000 feet by using their weather balloons instruments.

DURANGO, Colo., March 14 (UP) - Charles A. Maney and Bert Lowe of Durango, Colo., said they saw two unidentified flying objects over Durango yesterday while returning last week from a trip to New Mexico.

Lowe and Tanner of Cortez, Colo., said they had tried to avoid hitting the objects, but both refused to stop the car. When he slowed down, the objects maneuvered at tremendous speed, Tanner said. The objects, about five feet in diameter, traveled at an estimated 50 to 60-foot radius around the car, Tanner said.

Date      Month      Year

Strangely enough, one very strange thing happened last night - there was a bright light in the sky and there was a swishing noise as it came down and went into the house to get my mother who was asleep on the porch. I did not go outside and it did not come out again. The object was the size of a plane but round and about 30-40 yards away. It seemed to stop about 100 yards off the ground and was there only 20/13 secs. reflected my fear. I had a hard look at it for 3 secs. As it turned and came a little closer it seemed bigger and I felt I was being watched. Then with all the power it shot straight up and was gone. Could not hear any motor or sound, just a swishing noise as it came down and went up. I only saw a round, bright object, no lights or anything, and it did not touch the ground. I felt a little shaken afterwards as I don't think you would come in contact with something strange like that every day. We said very little to anyone about it until recently.

It did no one any harm.

Flying Saucer Whirls Above Baldwin Hills

It's an Odd Kite, With String Control, Designed by Former Jet Test Pilot as Aerial Target

A flying saucer whirled over the Baldwin Hills yesterday - but it had strings on it! 

Designed originally as an aerial target for gunnery practice, Wolford, former jet test pilot, thinks some of "flying disk" reports from householders may have been prompted by observing the targets.

The cardboard saucers are red, about 18 inches in diameter, with curved yellow wings that rotate. Powered by a small engine, and with the disc attached to long control strings, the objects are maneuvered by their operator on the ground.

In fact one of his first models was almost shot down by a National Guard plane when it was mistaken for a real aircraft. 

And so when someone found it in an open field and reported "I've seen a flying saucer," Wolford thinks he had to explain that it was just one of his demonstration pieces.

DURANGO, Colo., March 14 - Two Durango business-

which they said was not an airplane but looked like 
a flying saucer.

Locke of Durango and
Garnet Banner of Cortez, Colo.,
told the story quiet to avoid ribbing from
friends.

They said they were returning 
from Cortez, Colo., when the object 
began following their car. Both 
refused to call to a halt, fearing 
"But it was too fast for a bird, 
and too small for an airplane," 
Mr. Banner said.

"It must have been a tremendous 
machine," Banner said. The object, described as
25 feet in diameter, was said to have traveled 
on a 40-to-50-foot radius around 
the automobile.

"Clear in Headlights"
"We could see it clearly," Mr. 
Locke said, "for about five minutes while
they were following us." The "thing" zipped around
