Mexico Sees
Flying Saucers
-or Something

MEXICO CITY, March 11 (JP)
The director of a Mexican observatory today produced a photograph of a flying saucer but it looked more like an amateur's snapshot of a thing light.

The photograph was a black square with a diagonal band of light across it. The caption in the n- appear Excelsior and it was "possibly the only picture of a flying saucer which existed outside the larger countries."

Luis Enrique Erro, director of the Tonantzintla Astronomical Observatory, said the photograph was made, said the strange object crossed the sky March 2. Since that day we have wondered what it could have been. We don't know.

Meanwhile, dozens of reports of flying saucers poured into the capital from all over Mexico. The story was printed shortly after a Mexico City newspaper printed a series of letters which appeared in True magazine.

"Flying Triangle
Was Really There"

What would you say, Mrs. Ruby Lytle, 3250 Montana Ave., to a strange little man who called it a flying triangle, and who had the people send her some letters?

Mrs. Lytle had the experts in aviation matters call it a flying triangle, only the experts can't explain it. What she saw was a flying triangle, only experts in aviation matters can judge it to be between 40,000 and 50,000 feet. Consequently, there was no engines found, etc.

More time goes by, people will take it curiously. Here's hoping she doesn't see any more because, we fear, she will be back.

Trained Eyes See
Mexican Saucers
By the United Press

MEXICO CITY, March 14. — Trained aircraft observers and meteorologists confirmed reports today of hundreds of persons who said they saw four flying saucers yesterday over this city and one at Monterrey. 300 miles north.

Official observers said they saw from describing them as saucers but admitted that they were "flying bodies."

35,000 to 40,000 Feet Up
Meteorologists at the Mexico City airport calculated their altitude at between 35,000 and 40,000 feet. They used weather balloon tracking instruments to make their reckonings.

An airline's weatherman said he thought the one he saw was an asteroid, Santiago Smith, the Mexican Aviation Co.'s chief observer, said the one he watched was in the shape of a half-moon. Mr. Smith watched it through a telescope.

"It was there," said Mr. Smith. "It was no illusion."

J. De La Vega, a veteran employee of the airport commander's office, said he saw all four of the saucers. He said they appeared to be the size of a silver peso. Other observers guessed they were about 100 feet in diameter.

Moved in Straight Line
At Monterrey the government airport inspector, Francisco Martinez Soto, said he watched a flying body which moved in a straight line from a northwest to northeast.

Pilot Sights Saucer
Near Washington

By the United Press.
WASHINGTON, March 27.—A
veteran private pilot yesterday re-
ported sighting a flying saucer
within 35 miles of the capital.

Paetzel, a Totten said he saw
an aluminum-colored disk about
40 feet in diameter and 10 feet
thick while flying over the out-
skirts of Washington.

Mr. Totten, former airplane in-
spector for the Air Force, said he
was flying at 5000 feet when he
spotted the disk swirling along
about 1000 below him. It seemed
up into an overspread. He said
the saucer gave off vapor trails like
three aircraft engines.

More 'Flying Saucers'
In Mediterranean, Orient

LONDON, March 29—Flying saucers—variously described like full moon, moons with walks of fire, or strange bodies emitting smoke trails—have been reported skittering in all directions across the heavens above the Mediterranean.

In Malta today, reports circulated that they had been seen over various parts of Israel. A London pilot, who took part in the Arab Legion conference in Cairo, and who had been to the Arab League conference in Cairo, said he had seen them over Acre traveling at a high speed in a westerly direction. Others described them as "discs traveling northward at a great altitude and emitting a smoke trail."

It was noted that they had been sighted over various parts of the country five times yesterday.

Those Flying Discs—
'Saucer-Like' Object
Reported In Alabama

Birmingham area may have been visited by a "flying saucer" that may still be hidden in nearby wooded hills.
This was disclosed today by a man and his wife.
Military Intelligence has been informed of the report and will investigate.

The "saucer" was reported by Lt. L. Phillips, a representative of an insurance company of Louisville, Ky., who has an office in Haleyville.

Phillips reported that he and his wife were riding on Highway 5 between Haleyville and Bear Creek late on a recent afternoon. He said "something came from out of the West, going East. It crossed the highway and railroad nearby a few hundred yards from us."

He said the "saucer" was going down at "an" angle of 45 degrees. It was "an egg-like shape with a light bulb," he said. "White with a greenish behind. It was not making fast time and we watched it until it was about 15 miles a hill a short distance from us."

"It seemed to disintegrate just before it landed. A few days later some men and myself searched the region but were unable to find a trace.

"It was a very pretty bright sight with its bright white light and streamer following." Phillips said.

There is no military unit stationed in the Birmingham region that Lt. Investigator Pearce of the Air Force said.

He said "we will be guided by regulations on this."

BIRMINGHAM POST
14 March 50

MEXICO CITY, March 14 (UP)—Trained aircraft observers and meteorologists confirmed today hundreds of persons who said they saw four "flying saucers" yesterday over this city and at Monterrey, 350 miles north.

Official observers shed away from describing them as "saucers," but admitted that they were "flying bodies."

Meteorologists at the Mexico City Airport calculated the altitude of the bodies at between 35,000 and 40,000 feet by using their weather balloons tracking instruments.

An airline's weatherman said he watched one he saw was an asteroid. Santiago Smith, the Mexican aviation expert, said the one he watched was in the shape of a "half-moon."

DURANGO, Colo., March 14 (UP)—Two Southern Colorado businessmen said today that they were chased by a strange flying object while returning last week from a trip to New Mexico.

Lloyd Locke of Durango and Harold Tanner of Cortez, Colo., said they had tried to keep the story quiet to avoid ribbing from skeptical friends.

They said they were returning from Bloomfield, N. M., one night last week when the object began following their car. Both refused to call it a "flying saucer."

Tanner said he decided to stop the car. When he slowed, the machine at first began circling the object, then described as dark, flat, and about five feet in diameter, traveled on a 25 or 30-foot radius around the automobile.

The text in the image is largely handwritten and partially illegible. The page appears to be an "Official U.S. Air Force UFO form continued" with two sections containing handwritten notes and some blacked-out/redacted text. There are also two diagrams on the top half of the page - one appears to be a curved line graph and the other a circular target or compass-like diagram. The page is numbered "59" in the top left corner.

Due to the handwriting and image quality, I cannot confidently transcribe the full text. Some words are visible but most of the handwritten text is too difficult to definitively read.

Since Jesus only 1/20/13 ignorance protected my fears. I had a band look at it for approx 3 min. As it passed and came a little closer to me, it was surely much more almost freeze. In the center something moved a little and I felt I was feeling watched. Then went all the power I had slipped away from something unseen (perhaps just my fear). That seemed to exist force between us.

I did not miss the object into the sky traveling flat and station another minute or it was into the clouds. It almost in the same light, when extended (perhaps as a plummage) but round and when back. I did not look also gas. Thomas not seen when hovering about some. My mother said she never had heard before as it pass off.

We said very little to anyone about it until recently.

Amateur Photographer
Snaps Weird Disk in Sky
Girl With Miniature Camera Takes Picture
of Something Resembling Flying Saucer
A local amateur photographer has both seen and photographed in the sunset sky a weird object which yesterday deepened the flying disk mystery. Whether or not a real "flying saucer" actually has been photographed for the first time will depend upon results of a scientific investigation.

Should the vivid picture of the object be authenticated after experts have ruled out all possibilities of nature's optical vagaries, the pretty assistant in a Los Angeles medical office will have scooped the world! She is Miss Bette Malles, a Los Angeles resident, who took the picture while visiting an aunt in Hawthorne.

"I saw something queer and photographed it with my miniature camera," she told The Times. "I don't pretend at all to know what it was. In case it was something important, I don't wish to release it without the best possible caution."

Snapped Strange Object
"I was about to take a picture of a small plane flying over a Hawthorne air field when I suddenly saw something shining brightly and too near to use the shutter and this is what I got."

In the left background of the untouched negative and enlarged print is a vivid object which defies description. The central part of the object is composed of a luminous oblong doughnut, with "holes" being somewhat slightly darker center.

Like an outsider preceding this disk, is a circular blob which might be mistaken for a miniature plane. But the shape of the disk is suggestive of flight, of light projection upward and backward.

SNAPS DISK—Miss Bette Malles photographs weird object flying through sky.

SNAPS DISK—A second cone of light, preceding backward from the dark, narrows to meet another round blob of light which seems to be the disk's rear guard. But this isn't all there is to the geometrically shaped assembly.

The disk and its rear guard are enclosed within a large and perfectly circular halo, a similar halo, bisecting the former, following in the wake of the center of the disk. This rear guard has a luminous vapor-like haze which streams behind the rear guard "sun."

In the left foreground are the black silhouettes of telephone poles. The plane which Miss Malles was about to photograph when she saw the disk is visible in the right background.

The photographer declined to speculate on the actual size of the object or the speed at which it was traveling.

By the Associated Press
LOS ANGELES, March 9.—A dramatic sidelight told reporters today how a man who had seen the wreckage of a flying saucer in Mexico, actually had heard its story—by radio—only a trip of many miles away from the scene of the crash.

Ray P. Dimmick, radio manager for a power company, refused to name the associates, saying only that one was an American and the other a Chaffee-Winslow, Mr. Dimmick added his "word of honor" that the names "if requested by the proper authorities."

He said he was told that the wreckage was on a mountainside near Chihuahua, Mexico, and that the Air Force in Washington said it had nothing to confirm or deny.

Mr. Dimmick said his friends told him that a man had been killed in the crash and the radio conversation was established for scientific study. The crash occurred three months ago.

Remainder that his associates described the aircraft as 44 feet in diameter, built of a metal resembling aluminum but much harder, and powered by two motors. He described the size of an aircraft about three times that of a large thing.

Remainder that the Air Force announced in December it was probing its investigation of flying saucers, Mr. Dimmick said. "I'm not going to take the consequences," he added.

A radio station operator said that morning that another saucer was seen over Mazatlan.

A Denver, Colo., KFEL, Walter Phipps, officer of the Air Material Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force base.

Californian Reports He Saw
Part Of Wrecked "Saucer"
LOS ANGELES, March 9.—(AP)—An expert on chemicals and explosives told reporters today he had seen the wreckage of an ultrastrengthening flying saucer on a Mexico City mountainside, and that top U. S. military officials had confirmed it.

But there was a confirmation of the account, related by Ray L. Dimmick, sales manager of the Apache Powder company, and the man who said he was the pilot who had heard nothing about it.

Dimmick later told newsmen he actually saw only a strip of metal which he was told came from the wreckage.

The remainder of his information, he said, came from two business men in Mexico City, one an American, the other a Mexican, who were "climbing to name names."

Composer Eddie Coffman said he, as a pilot, had a close view of the wreckage and his body was embalmed for scientific study.

Through a telescope, he said, it appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter, eight inches thick, and traveling at extreme speed.

AIR-GOING DISK—Roy Wolford, left, and Don Shadin, engineering student, pictured with "flying disk" designed by Wolford for use as high-speed tow target for aerial gunnery practice. Wolford, former jet test pilot, thinks some of flying disk reports from householders may have been due to their observing his targets.

Flying Saucer Whirls Above Baldwin Hills

It's an Odd Kite, With String Control, Designed by Former Jet Test Pilot as Aerial Target

A flying saucer whirled over the Baldwin Hills yesterday—but it had strings on it!

On the ground, holding the strings, was Roy Wolford, former jet test pilot, who designed the odd little kite originally as a high-speed tow target for aerial gunnery practice.

Wolford thinks his cardboard saucers may be the cause of many a flying disk report from householders who glimpsed one of the kites spinning in the air.

In fact one of his first models—a 16-ounce, almost disk-was checked by the FBI about a year ago when someone found it in an abandoned hangar near Edwards Air Force Base, Muroc.

Wolford had been testing a plane and a kite, cracked it up and left it in the hangar to await repairs.

ALOFT—Here's the Wolford flying disk, kite as it appears in air, with strings attached. The "saucer" is red with curved yellow wings that rotate with disk.

In fact one of his first models—a 6-foot all-metal disk—was checked by the FBI about a year ago when someone found it in an abandoned hangar near Edwards Air Force Base, Muroe. Wolford had been testing it in the desert near Muroc Plains, cracked it up and left it in the hangar for await repair.

His cardboard saucers are red, about 18 inches in diameter, with curved yellow wings that rotate with the disk.

In the sky, the popping of a sound like the dropping of an egg makes the disk dive, climb, whirl in circles, etc. through control of two strings fixed to the wing tips.

Flying Whatsit Chases
2 Westerners in Car
They Won't Admit
It Was a Saucer
By the U nited Press

DURANGO, Colo, March 14.—
Two southern Colorado business-
men said today that they were
chased by a strange flying object
while returning last week from a
trip to New Mexico.

Alton Jacke of Durango and
Harold Unger of Cortez, Colo.,
said they had tried to keep the
story quiet to avoid ribbing from
friends.

Followed Their Car.

They said they were returning
from Bloomfield, N. Mex., one
night last week when the object
began following their car. Both
refused to call it a flying saucer.

"But it was too fast for a bird
and too small for an airplane,"
Mr. Tanner said.

Mr. Tanner said when he slowed
down, the object began circling
the machine at a tremendous
speed. The object, described as
dark, flat, and about 5 feet in diameter, was said to have traveled
on a 25 or 30-foot radius around
the automobile.

Clear in Headlights.

"We could see it clearly when
it passed the headlights," Mr.
Locke said.

For about five minutes while
they were parked, they said, the
"thing" slipped around the car.
