The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. This page discusses the view of Dr. Harlow Shapley, former director of the Harvard Observatory, who believes that there must be 100 million planets in the universe where intelligent beings exist, not necessarily like our earthly brand.

Here is the text of the document:

EDWARDS:

Dr. Harlow Shapley, former director of the Harvard Observatory, tells us that there must be 100 million planets in the universe where intelligent beings exist...not necessarily like our earthly brand...live and multiply and think.  

And some authorities have claimed actual evidence that this type of life does exist on other planets.

Here's an example of the evidence they offer.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is a dialogue between two individuals, ARNOLD and EDWARDS, discussing their personal experiences with sightings of so-called "Flying Saucers".

ARNOLD: I guess so. Because that's how the name 'Flying Saucers' came to be.

EDWARDS: Have you ever seen these so-called Flying Saucers since?

ARNOLD: Yes I have. I've seen strange objects in the sky on at least three different occasions. And I know some regular airline pilots who have made more than a dozen sightings. But we don't talk much about it. Making a Flying Saucer report is like opening your living room to a bob-cat. You get clawed, scratched and spit on. You're either a real fruitcake or you're out to get publicity by spreading lies. I saw what I saw...and I reported it to the proper authorities.

After the Mantell crash, UFO reports continued to pile in. During January and February of 1948 the sightings took on an international flavor. "Balls of fire, traveling slowly across the sky" were reported from Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Germany. Then Southern Rhodesia reported similar sightings.

WHEDON: No, we don't. We still believe that he blacked out from lack of oxygen and crashed... and this is supported by the findings of the Air Force Accident Investigators, an outfit completely independent of Project Bluebook. But we are now sure that this is what he was chasing...

Direct from the files of the Air Technical Intelligence Center ... another case. 
Date: March 9, 1957. A commercial airliner flying between New York and San Juan, Porto Rico had an extraordinary experience. Flying at 19,000 feet it sighted a large, bright object that appeared to be coming directly towards the liner. It was described as "a magnesium-flash" in color with a pale green tint. The pilot had to swerve his plane violently to avoid collision.

WHEDON: 
A check of military positions in the area ruled out any unusual plane or missile activity. However, CAB ... the Civil Aeronautics Board did report six other commercial flights over approximately the same area at the time of the sighting. Five of the six planes reported similar sightings. So we plotted out their positions on a map ...

The other planes are grouped around it ... the farthest plane that reported a sighting was 175 miles away.

CUT BACK TO WHEDON
The major clues we had to work on were the color, the trajectory and the fact that three of the planes reported that the object seemed to split apart in the air.
This description coincides with the known features of what are called "bolides" or "fireballs" ... a rather rare astronomical phenomenon ... but reported from time to time, especially from the Southwest.

EDWARDS: Do these astronomical phenomena play a large part in the UFO story?

The text describes a "flying saucer" that turned out to be a "flying hat" encountered by a science teacher. The text discusses the details of this incident, including that the object "reaches under a table and brings up the copper pail" and that it was supposedly a UFO picked up by the science teacher. The text includes comments from two individuals, Edwards and Whedon, discussing the nature of the object and the attempts to modify it.

The important thing here is that this type of hoax besides being a violation of federal law, it is a rather expensive joke. A single UFO investigation may well cost the government $10,000. The perpetrators of these childish pranks might think twice about it when they remember it's their own tax money that's being wasted ... money that could go into serious research so badly needed at this time.

The text in the document appears to be a detailed report or article discussing a mysterious sighting of "flying saucers" in New York in January. The report discusses an "enigma cave" where the saucers were seen, as well as the television program that covered the incident and the response from the Air Force and a key figure named "Keyhoe."

BUT AN UNEXPECTED ELEMENT ENTERED THE PROGRAM WHEN KEYHOE STARTED TO SAY THAT HE WAS GOING TO "REVEAL SOMETHING WHICH HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN REVEALED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC."
HIS CONTINUED SPEAKING, WITH REFERENCE TO A "SECRET" SENATE COMMITTEE HE SAID HAD BEEN INVESTIGATING HIS DISCLOSURES FOR SIX MONTHS, HIS VOICE FADED OUT. CBS LATER DISCLOSED IT HAD CUT OFF THE AUDIO BECAUSE KEYHOE WAS DEPARTING FROM AN AGREED-UPON PREPARED SCRIPT.
THIS IMMEDIATELY LED TO SPECULATION ABOUT THE SENATE INVESTIGATION, ACCORDING TO KEYHOE, THE SENATE SEEKS TO DETERMINE WHETHER, AS HAS BEEN CHARGED, PILOTS HAVE BEEN "MUZZLED" AND FORBIDDEN TO TALK PUBLICLY ABOUT SIGHTED SAUCERS.
KEYHOE, WHO HAS WRITTEN BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT, SAYS HE REMAINS CONVINCED--DESPITE ALL OFFICIAL DENIALS--THAT SOME OF THE SIGHTED MYSTERY OBJECTS HAVE BEEN INTERPLANETARY SPACESHIPS.

Dear Mr. Chapman:

This is to acknowledge your request of 31 December 1960 for a copy of the initial progress report on the UFO Bridge project. 

I regret that we do not have copies of this script for distribution. However, we do have a file copy on hand and your request to receive this office for read or copy it in whole or in part.

In addition, I am including the latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet on the general subject of UFOs. This clearly states the position of the Air Force and the Department of Defense.

Dear Sir:

On January 22, 1958, the Armstrong Circle Theater presented a program which dealt with the unidentified flying object. The program was entitled "Flying Saucers - The Sides" and was supposed to present both sides of the UFO controversy. The show consistently did not proceed according to plan as some of the individuals scheduled to appear did not-specifically Edward J. Ruppelt, Kenneth Arnold, and Captain C.S.Chiles. The most dramatic segment of the program occurred when Edward E. Keyhoe was cut-off in the middle of a paragraph.

In June of 1958, I sent a letter to Talent Associates requesting a copy of the script used on July 31, 1958. I received a letter from Mr. C.O. Hess saying that the supply of scripts had been "exhausted" and that it is indeed hard to believe that the requests for these scripts had so far exceeded the supply that the Armstrong Company did not have a single copy left in their organization.

Since the CBS program appeared, a number of articles have appeared concerning 'censorship' of the script for this program and especially in regard to Mr. Keyhoe's section of the show the way in which my request for a copy of the script was denied by Mr. Hess only supports this charge made by Mr. Keyhoe and others.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me where I could obtain a copy of said script.

Thank you.
Sincerely,
J. Chapman

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Mr. H.L. Keyhoe, Staff Member of your Subcommittee, informed Major John J. Downey, Director of Public Relations of the Air Force, that the Subcommittee was informed that the Air Force investigation of "Unidentified Flying Objects" was terminated as of January 1958. This was not correct. Major Downey was requested that your Subcommittee be informed that the investigation is still in progress. 

It was unfortunate that the producers of this show had to put Major Keyhoe on the spot, when he had beforehand assured your Subcommittee that the Air Force investigation was continuing. The information developed to date does not justify a complete reappraisal of the problem. While there have been many incidents which have caused some concern, the factors influencing these sightings were found to be natural phenomena or man-made objects. These incidents were required to take such action as to determine the exact nature of the phenomenon in a dispassionate, thorough and scientific manner. Nonetheless, there are some individuals who make emotional and unsupported claims that this identifies these incidents as evidence of visitors from outer space. We are prone to remember such claims, even though they are neither supportable nor based on solid scientific data. On the other hand, scientifically valid information on the subject remains difficult to obtain.

The allegation that the Air Force has withheld pertinent information on Unidentified Flying Object reports is entirely in error. The policy of this organization has been to make fully available to the public the results of all Air Force investigations of such reports. Many persons who report sightings do not wish to have the circumstances of their report made public. Since this information is considered confidential, the details made public have necessarily been confined to the minimum which would permit the matter evaluation.

SAFDD CASE

Dear Mr. Vigilesworth:

You recently requested information concerning air force investigations of unidentified flying objects.

The allegation that the air force has withheld critical information on unidentified flying objects is entirely erroneous. Many persons who report sightings to the air force do so in confidence hoping that their identities will not be disclosed. Since this information is not consistent with the conditions outlined, no scientific or objective conclusions as to the nature of these sightings can be made public. Since this information is confidential, the air force is not justified in violating what it believes to be the wishes of these persons.

The air force is compelled to deal scientifically and objectively with the facts developed during its investigations of unidentified flying objects as outlined in the attached fact sheet. The committee desires of holding public hearings on this subject.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest developments on this subject, dated 5 November 1957. You will note that paragraph 7 of the fact sheet should be amended to change the last sentence to read "The files on unidentified flying objects are adequate CTBJ TAPE."
