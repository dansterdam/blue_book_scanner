...and we know that there are
some 2,000 million galaxies such
as ours swirling through space.

(DISSOLVE TO: EDWARDS)

We know this much about the uni-
verse ... and we know little
else ... for sure...

Is there life on other planets?
Intelligent life ... substantially
like our own?

Scientists tell us that to be-
lieve our earth alone can sustain
life is an absurd conclusion.

Among the billions of planets in
the millions of galaxies, there
must be many that sustain some
type of living creatures.


- page 2 -

EDWARDS:

Dr. Harlow Shapley, former director of the Harvard Observatory, tells us that there must be 100 million planets in the universe where intelligent beings...not necessarily like our earthly brand...live and multiply and think.

And some authorities have claimed actual evidence that this type of life does exist on other planets. Here's an example of the evidence they offer.

DISSOLVE TO: ARTCARD #3
(OF MARS SHOWING CANALI)

This is Mars. Telescopes reveal strange geometric lines crisscrossing its surface. 40 years ago, Percival Lowell, a distinguished American astronomer stated that these lines ... the canali ... are true evidence of intelligent life on Mars.

EDWARDS:
He said Mars was a dying planet
...dying from lack of water...
and the lines were irrigation
canals the Martians had dug to
bring water from the melting polar
ice-caps into their parched planet.
The moon is our nearest neighbor
in space...

gigantic bridge now stretches
across a region of the moon known
as the Mare Crisium.

Scientists charted this region
many years ago...and no such
bridge was in evidence then. But
reliable experts claim it is
there now...and that it appeared
literally almost overnight.

If it is a natural bridge...
created by natural forces of
erosion as we know them on earth
...it would take millions of years
to form. And its presence would
have been noted long before 1953.

If it is a natural object...why
wasn't it seen before?

If it is not a natural object...
then what can it be?

There are those who claim that
its construction proves the ex-
istence of intelligence on the
moon... not necessarily moon-
people...but beings from outer

I judged their wing-span to be
about 100 feet across. I watched
them for several minutes. They
were traveling from north to
south, flying in reversed echelon
formation...and as they flew they
weaved in and out between the
mountain peaks. They had a kind

ARNOLD:
That's right. I didn't make
too much of the incident...as
I said, I thought they were jets.
I said they fluttered like...
well, like boats on very rough
water...I said they flew like
you took a saucer and skimmed
it across water. Well, the papers
printed a real garbled version.
They quoted me as saying they
looked like saucers. I didn't
say that at all. I said they
flew in a saucer-like fashion.

EDWARDS: (VO)
That was an historic misquote.

Here is the text from the document:

ARNOLD:

I guess so. Because that's how the name 'Flying Saucers' came to be.

EDWARDS: (VO)
Have you ever seen these so-called Flying Saucers since?

ARNOLD:
Yes I have. I've seen strange objects in the sky on at least three different occasions. And I know some regular airline pilots who have made more than a dozen sightings. But we don't talk much about it. Making a Flying Saucer report is like opening your living room to a bob-cat. You get clawed, scratched and spit on. You're either a real fruitcake or you're out to get publicity by spreading lies. I saw what I saw...and I reported it to the proper authorities.

ARNOLD:

The Air Force investigated at the time and said no jets were flying near that area that day.

I feel that if these objects were not made by our science and flown by our Air Forces, then I'm inclined to believe that you've got to say they were of extra-terrestrial origin.

EDWARDS: (VO)
Extra-terrestrial...from another world, another planet?

ARNOLD:
That's right.

EDWARDS: (VO)
That's saying a lot.

I know it. I'll tell you this much. All of us who have made sightings...I'm not talking about crackpots now...but reliable people who can be depended on...well, none of us have appreciated being laughed at. We made our reports because we

it's anything for people to get
hysterical about. But there's
something going on besides Sputnik,

EDWARDS:

Good evening everybody, coast to coast. This is Douglas Edwards.

Tonight the Circle Theatre goes after a most unusual story: the riddle of the Flying Saucers.

Because of the nature of the problem ... and the controversy involved ... we will depart from our usual format. Instead of dramatizing an adventure, we will share one. Instead of merely observing, we ask you to participate. Are UFO ... Unidentified Flying Objects real or imagined?

If these so-called Flying Saucers are real ... Where do they come from? Are they secret weapons being tested by our own or foreign governments ... or are they ... as many believe ... spacecraft from other planets, invading our atmosphere, observing life on earth?

....under the command of Captain
Thomas Mantell, a veteran combat
pilot was immediately vectored
in on the strange spherical-
shaped object.

(CUT BACK TO EDWARDS)

What happened then depends upon
what version you read. There
were seven witnesses in Godman
Tower....and their accounts differ
in many details. But this is sure.
Captain Mantell....by radio....re-
ported sighting the object above
him. He said it was "Metallic
and of tremendous size". Mantell's
plane was not equipped with Oxygen...

...yet he headed upward. One of his wingmen broke off as the climb began. The remaining two stayed with him to 15,000 feet, then broke off. Mantell was in a maximum climb at 22,500, his plane under perfect control.

(CUT BACK TO EDWARDS)

From this point on, there is nothing but mystery. Transmission was garbled and attempts to contact Mantell went unanswered.

Mantell's plane began to level off at 30,000 feet...began a gradual turn to the left...then it nosed downward...and....at full power....began to dive.

Between 10 and 20 thousand feet, the plane literally tore apart.


- page 25 -

CUT TO: ARTCARD #28
(OF MANTELL CRASH)

EDWARDS:

Mantell was killed. Parts of
his plane were found more than
half a mile from the central
wreckage.

(CUT BACK TO EDWARDS)

There are questions that must
be answered about this tragic
incident. Why did an experienced
pilot like Mantell break one of
the cardinal rules of flying:
never go above 10,000 feet with-
out oxygen? What did he see that
forced him to throw caution to
the winds?

After the Mantell crash, UFO re-
ports continued to pile in. Dur-
ing January and February of 1948
the sightings took on an inter-
national flavor. "Balls of Fire,
traveling slowly across the sky"
were reported from Norway, Denmark,
Sweden and Germany. Then Southern

Travelling at a speed estimated between 500 and 700 miles an hour, the light bore in on them. The object was brilliantly lighted...

it appeared to have two sets of windows, and underneath, from the belly of the ship, there was a sort of blue fluorescent glow.

As they watched fascinated, the object flashed by about 700 feet to their right.

On landing, Chiles and Whitted reported the incident to the proper authorities and then each drew a sketch of what he saw.

no logical explanation offered
by scientists, by experts...fits
the bill. People may argue about
what they saw...but they can't
deny that they saw something...
something that these men with
thousands of hours of flying
experience had never seen before

Part of the operation was the
dropping of parachute flares
from aircraft ... as well as
jet-support for ground opera-
tions.

We obtained the photographs men-

Enlargements of the black-and-

get some surprising results.

Direct from the files of the
Air Technical Intelligence
Center ... another case.
Date: March 9, 1957. A commercial
airliner flying between New York
and San Juan, Porto Rico had an
extraordinary experience. Flying
at 19,000 feet it sighted a large,
bright object that appeared to
be coming directly towards the
liner. It was described as
"a magnesium-flash" in color with
a pale green tint. The pilot
had to swerve his plane violently
to avoid collision.

EDWARDS: (Cont'd)
This sighting caused quite a news-
paper stir.

WHEDON:
It did.

EDWARDS:
Well, what does the Air Force
have to say about it now?

WHEDON:
A check of military positions
in the area ruled out any unusual
plane or missile activity.
However, CAB... the Civil Aero-
nautics Board did report six other
commercial flights over approxi-
mately the same area at the time
of the sighting. Five of the six
planes reported similar sightings.
So we plotted out their positions
on a map ...

The major clues we had to work on
were the color, the trajectory

seemed to split apart in the air.

So the Air Force attributes the
sighting to a "fireball"...

WHEDON:
It was not only our findings.
We submitted all the data to a
member of the Smithsonian Astro-
physical Observatory who confirmed
our conclusions completely.

EDWARDS:
Do these astronomical phenomena
play a large part in the UFO story?

WHEDON:
Quite a bit. The moon and the
planets, observed through haze,
light fog or moving clouds can
play optical tricks. And then
there are the rarer celestial
sights: mirages, auroral dis-
plays ... or, how about this ...

Afraid not. Whoever made it went

Russian words on the inside ... but
they got the letters wrong and for-

Inside, there's nothing but a hodge-

The important thing here is that
this type of hoax besides being

Script - Please Release

23 Donna Drive

December 31, 1960

Major Lawrence J. Tacker
Office of Public Information
United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir:

On January 22, 1958, the Armstrong Circle Theater presented a program which dealt with the unidentified flying object. The program was entitled "UFO: The Enigma of the Skies" and was supposed to present both sides of the UFO controversy. The show apparently did not proceed according to plan as some of the individuals scheduled to appear did not-specifically Edward J. Ruppelt, Kenneth Arnold, and Captain C.S. Chiles. The most dramatic segment of the program occurred when Donald E. Keyhoe was cut-off in the middle of a paragraph.

In June of 1958, I sent a letter to Talent Associates requesting a copy of the script used on the program. On July 31, 1958, I received a letter from Mr. C.O. Hess saying that the supply of scripts had been "exhausted". It is indeed hard to believe that the requests for these scripts had so far exceeded the supply that the Armstrong Company did not have a single copy left in their whole organization.

Since the CBS program appeared, a number of articles have appeared concerning 'censorship' of the script for this program and especially in regard to Mr. Keyhoe's section of the show. The way in which my request for a copy of the script was denied by Mr. Hess only supports this charge made by Mr. Keyhoe and others.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me where I could obtain a copy of said script.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
J. Chapman

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Mr. Bush, Staff Member of your Subcommittee, informed Major John Torke of our Senate Liaison office that your Subcommittee has received a considerable number of letters from Texas expressing concern with the Air Force Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. These inquiries were stimulated by the American Circle Television show of 22 January 1958. Mr. Bush requested that your Subcommittee be advised of the Air Force position in this matter.

It was unfortunate that the producers of this show had to cut Major Kehoe off of the air when he began to depart from the script which he had beforehand agreed to adhere to. For the producers' point of view, however, this was necessary in order to protect the network from possible law suits. The Air Force regrets that the producers were forced to take such action, but is not changing their stand rather than detracted from Major Kehoe's position concerning his sensational and unsupported claims that Unidentified Flying Objects are real, and that the Air Force is withholding from the public critical information on the subject. People are prone to remember such sensational claims as his rather than the responsible statements of the qualified Air Force witnesses such as those on the same program.

The allegation that the Air Force has withheld critical information on Unidentified Flying Objects is entirely without merit. We are interested in the truth concerning reported sightings and are fully aware of our obligation to keep the public informed on such matters. Many persons who report sightings to the Air Force do not wish their names, the names of associated people, or some of the circumstantial details made public. Since this information is not considered critical for proper evaluation, their wishes in this regard are respected.

The Air Force is compelled to seal scientifically and objectively with the facts developed during an investigation of an Unidentified Flying Object sighting. We feel certain that the analysis and evaluation on the facts will be qualitative, scientific, persuasive, and sound and adequate. Because we have this firm conviction, the Air Force stands ready to give its wholehearted cooperation to any congressional committee desiring a full public, public hearings on this subject.
