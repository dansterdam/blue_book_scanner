1. The following statements are forwarded for your information:

a. Statement by [REDACTED], Las Vegas, Nevada.

"About 8:15 A.M., I was sitting at our breakfast table talking with my wife.
Typically, I was present in the kitchen adjoining, was very definitely
conscious of my surroundings, and was completely relaxed, calm, and collected.

My wife was seated facing the dining room. Suddenly she cried out, "Flying
saucers!"

I made a remark jokingly, in disbelief, and then seeing her tense face and
intense sincerity, I jumped up, and with my wife, daughter, and following
her, rushed to the yard as the South side of the house.

At this time, I first sighted two flying objects, moving S.W., extending 20°
above horizon. This by subsequent estimation against large trees, including from
point of observation. Course of the objects apparently was, temporarily circling,
very smooth and apparently very rapid. I realize that speed could not be judged
with any certainty. Distance of objects, which could not be estimated.

At this time they were obscured by a large cottonwood tree. They reappeared,
on an apparent perfect projection of their first course.

Course of the objects was apparently a long glide, with no change in forward
speed. Also easily and with considerable accuracy described. Course was direct,
was relative, azimuth less than 150 above horizon apparently on a westerly course
and because obscured by a large cottonwood tree, I do not assume any connection,
but do so happen that this same tree obscured view of objects from point of
observed flash for recent A.F.O. test explosion. Distance still unknown, except
I would say this side of Charleston Junction.

From the time of my wife's first exclamation, until the objects disappeared,
I would estimate by re-enactment of the events say 30 seconds.

We watched for about one minute afterwards and saw nothing of further interest.

I placed a call to 2005 immediately after and not a busy signal. In about two
minutes I tried again and was unsuccessful in making a report to the CIA control
tower.

My description of the objects would be two discrete large shaped objects, the
leading one above the horizon, color significant to that of aerial dense clouds,
uniform gray and under a cloud. Two, possibly three, were a dark, to gray,
solid, 11 wide, round or other configuration. I will state that at the time I
considered this both a night to daylight observation. I cannot state how far or what
colored jet plane. But this context was discussed with the objects more will
under consideration. One was, to my observation, leading and the other following
the line of flight which a ton 2000 would have had to make. I have seen pictures
of jet planes and so not believe even a glider could have made the position
to its being place that was made by these two objects.

I have no idea as to what the nature of the objects could be. Sketches
follow.

Color could have been due to frost covered surfaces, or the to surfaces of such a white as would radiate heat practically as a "black object".

(Reconnaissance view, slightly)

Inasmuch as possibly, could possibly have been fan jet shaped rather than loose shaped.

Inasmuch as possible, the preceding is my independent observation containing no hearsay and without results of collaboration with the other observers.

I served 5 years at Airways Stations in the U.S. Weather Bureau, including:
Las Vegas, Nevada (37 to 40), Observer
Fresno, California (40 - 41) in Charge
Long Beach, California (41 - 42 in Charge
Oxnard Field)

Also, 5 years following above, in the CAA as Radio Technician at Salt Lake City Airport.

My vision when last tested, I saw at 20 feet the 20 foot basis.

I saw two almost transparent looking objects gliding at a high rate of speed. They were flying parallel. 2 just seen a few moments behind the first.

c. Statement by [REDACTED]

I saw two round objects, silver or white color. To me they looked like they were flying. They were very fast. In a smooth glide, I watched about one minute, then went in.

d. Statement by Mrs. [REDACTED]

At approximately 9:45 in the morning of July 15 I was seated at our breakfast table with my husband in our yard. Two women were in the kitchen which adjoins the room we were in. I was the only one seated facing the south window. I saw very small objects glide into view from behind the next house chimney. At first they looked like small white objects gliding out I noticed. There was no much gliding that it was a first glimpse and has remained with me. As I did watch they were in a forward glide, no like objects I had seen and definitely not a bird, I pointed, excluding "flying Saucers."

My husband made some gliding remark that I got to my feet and he did also. We looked out the window. Immediately my 11 year old daughter, an employee and 15, came out. They, an adult worker who was also following us, had a mechanical, they said, disappeared and came back immediately upon reappearing. I saw them and my husband said he did also, pointing to them. They were all wearing, who were my daughter and son said they saw those. From the very first instant I spotted these as not normal flying objects, they seemed to me to be round, silvery, gliding speed and more traveling on a downward angle until I last saw them. I looked like they would come to the side of Lower Charleston (Spring) Mountain if we could have seen them.

They were to my sight, very white and looked as if they might be round, with one view from the edge. They did not appear to be very thick. I am just what distance from ground so I could not say exact what I would have seen clear at.

A re-enactment of our motions and words from the time I first spotted them until we saw them disappear was 30 seconds.

There were two of the objects, one slightly behind the other and it appeared to be a smaller object. They could have been 15 to 20 degrees on the other side of the forward and lower opposite one. They disappeared, within the same degree, that they were going, a cloud from a clear sky.

The above is my conception of what I saw without collaboration from any one else except for the re-enactment of time it took for the craft to pass.

1. Two unidentified flying objects were observed from the ground in Las Vegas, Nevada 15 July 1952. They were first sighted at 1620Z, and observed for one minute by three persons.

2. Objects were white, shaped like a lens or cigar, and made no jet stream or vapor trail. Their altitude was unknown, but their speed was very high (faster than jet aircraft).

3. When first sighted, the objects were over the city of Las Vegas, moving westward, and then disappeared into the haze.

4. Las Vegas weather at 1520Z 15 July was reported:
   a. Sky clear, visibility 35 miles, temperature 90 degrees, dew point 47, altitude setting 29.03, surface winds calm.
   b. Winds aloft: 15,000 feet, from 150° at 7 knots
                   15,000 "   " 2000 at 3 knots
                   20,000 "   " 2000 at 13 knots
                   25,000 "   " 2000 at 30 knots

5. Nellis Air Force Base, Las Vegas, Nevada, reported several flights of jet aircraft in local training missions, in the air at the time of sighting. Las Vegas Intercontinental Airways Communications Station (USAC) reported no aircraft under Air Traffic Control in the general area at the time of sighting.

6. Reporting observer was located at Third Street, Las Vegas, Nevada, who submitted the information to Las Vegas TISAC via telephone.

7. REPORT was submitted via teletype by March Flight Service Center (Message 188 815A of 16 July).

8. No physical evidence of the object sighted has been reported. No interception or identification action was reported.

Comments of Preparing Officer:

1. Citizens of Las Vegas, Nevada, should be familiar with the appearance of jet type aircraft, due to the pilot training program at Nellis Air Force Base. However, appearance of aircraft at altitude differs markedly from appearance during landing or takeoff. At a speed of 600 miles per hour, an aircraft would move over Las Vegas in a position less than 12 miles from the observer, if at an altitude of 30,000 feet or less.

2. It is impossible to ascertain the positions of the jet type aircraft reported by Nellis Air Force Base at the time of the sighting, as they did not file route or position (lat) and could have been anywhere in the local flying area. (Approximately within 100 miles of Las Vegas)

3. Information probably was transmitted through Los Angeles Air Route Control Center (ARTC), to March Flight Service Center by Las Vegas TISAC (via CAA "A" interphone).
