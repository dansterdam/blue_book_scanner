1. The following statement was forwarded for your information:

  Observation by withheld was sighted while on duty in the project area. Sighting was on 27 June 52 at approximately 0830 hrs. The witness was employed in a responsible position at the time and is considered reliable. The incident was sighted and verified by other observers as well.

At this time, a bright, dazzling white light, circular in shape, was observed in the western sky, flying at high speed, and climbing in altitude. The light appeared to be about the size of a small aircraft at an estimated distance of some 15 to 20 miles. It was traveling in a south-southwest direction. The light was observed for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before disappearing from view.

This incident follows an earlier sighting of similar nature on 23 June 52 at approximately 0830 hrs in the general area which was described as follows:

At this time, a single bright, white light, estimated to be about the size of a small aircraft, was observed traveling in a southerly direction across the sky at high speed and climbing in altitude. This light was observed for about 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from view.

In the first case, Lt. Colonel, USAF, was notified as a matter of record. No other action is contemplated.

Limitation of flight

As seen from earth, the objects reported could have been reflections of the sun upon the surface of such objects as would simulate "bright objects". 
Limitation of flight

As seen in both views, could possibly have been Pam Jab shaped rather than large, no horns and with a slight trail, containing no hazards and obvious possibilities of collaboration with other observers.

I, J. L. THOMPSON, STATES: 

On July 11, 1952, at approximately 9:15 P.M., I was outside of my home located at 1 2215 Olive St., Las Vegas, Nevada, looking up at the clear sky. I observed a bright light, silver in color, traveling at a fast rate of speed in a straight line from north to south. The light was much larger than any star I have ever seen and its brightness was much greater than any aircraft light. It was visible for about 10 seconds.

The light appeared to be oval in shape and was approximately the size of a ping-pong ball held at arm's length. It did not blink or waver in its course but kept a straight line of flight. I was startled by this unusual sight and called to my wife, who also observed the light as it passed across the sky. We were both amazed by the speed and brilliance of the object.

As the light passed, it diminished in size and brightness until it disappeared from view. The sighting lasted for approximately 10 seconds. I have never seen anything like this before and I am unable to account for what I observed. It did not have the characteristics of any known aircraft.

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The description states that two unidentified flying objects were sighted over Las Vegas, Nevada on 15 July 1952. The text mentions that the objects were silver in color and shaped like cigar or tube. The observer was able to observe the objects for a short period and deemed the observation suitable for further investigation.

Regarding flying objects sighted near Las Vegas, Nevada:
On July 8, 1952, a number of people observed a cigar-shaped object flying over the ground in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
The object was white, showed like a long or cigar-shaped object, and gave the impression of rotating or oscillating. It was sighted from the ground in Las Vegas, Nevada.
As the object first sighted, the objects were over the city of Las Vegas, moving eastward. As they disappeared they gradually ascended and moved out of sight.
At Las Vegas, Nevada, on July 8, 1952, it was reported:
a. City police received numerous telephone calls from citizens reporting a strange aerial object in the sky over Las Vegas.
b. Width of object was estimated to be about 100 feet long. Elevation up to 12,000 feet. Speed up to 600 to 700 mph.
The object was tracked by radar at Las Vegas and it showed a maximum speed of 1700 mph and an altitude of 20,000 feet. It was observed at one point near 12,000 feet altitude.
Some information was received from Nellis AFB, Las Vegas, Nevada, who submitted the information to this command via telephone.
No photographs of the object sighted were obtained.
No interception or other action was reported.
1. Citizens of Las Vegas, Nevada, should be familiar with the appearance of jet aircraft, inasmuch as Nellis AFB, Las Vegas, is the home of the Air Force Gunnery and Guided Missile Schools. Sighting of various types of aerial objects is common in the Las Vegas area. However, the appearance of the object sighted on July 8, 1952 was not typical of known aircraft. The object's speed, maneuverability, and appearance were such that it could have been anything airborne from a satellite to an extraterrestrial vehicle. The incident is considered of such significance that project BLUE BOOK considers it to be one of the more interesting sightings of 1952.
2. Confirmation probably was transmitted through Los Angeles Air Defense Filter Center to March Field, California (Riverside), who in turn notified the Fourth Air Force (San Bernardino).
