SUBJECT: Report on Aerial Phenomenon.

1. At 2305 local time I accepted a collect call from [redacted] in Alexandria, [redacted] who wanted to no more or less than to tell me that he had seen an aerial phenomenon while driving on an aerial shot up a Major Bailey at the Pentagon. I question so [redacted] in accordance with AFR 200-2. (13 Cost Sgt) "I recommend in accordance with paragraph 3, below. Cagle Curtis states he wants no publicity.

2. At 2325, Major Bailey, Staff Duty Officer at AFRCC, [redacted] had called AFJCC upon his shift who [redacted] and of his knowledge had been informed that a similar attitude of similar calls had been received at the same base. [redacted] was quite responsible. Cagle wished further to notify AFJCC 300 that [redacted] calls from Andrews, Ops, and the local warrants occasionally.

3. The responses to the questions in AFJCC Op. 154 are as follows:

1. 20 May 1959
2. 2110 hrs.
3. Potomac Daylight time
4. 1 scene, address [redacted], Alexandria, Virginia.
5. 3 persons
6. Certain

8. Very clear
9. 3/8 full moonlit (Full moon through overcast as per 6, above)

Here is the text from the document:

14. Sound.
15. Sun 11 o'clock.
16. Azimuth, near East, my position fixed at place.
17. Temp 37deg, except for direction fixed at place.
18. Single object, event not tracking at the observation.
19. Sighted object from NW observation at 40 degrees above horizon
    was moving, to last observation at 45 carres above horizon at north
    northwest.
20. Cannot estimate size in absolute figures, but appeared about one-
    tenth diameter of moon.
21. See 21, above. (In terms of object in hove, duration approximately
    one-half diameter of the full moon in length).
22. See 11, above.
23. Does not consider possible in terms of weather. Sometimes it
    is more difficult to tell artificial satellite like other atmospheric
    satellites.
24. Residential section.
25. Sighting in yard of home.
26. Sky.
27. West.
28. Mass of earth, approximately 300.
29. (See 20, above)
30. (See 20, above)
31. (See 20, above)
32. Slight trace (estimate 5 knots).
33. Slight.
34. Hraid.
35. Dim.
36. Immediately after observation, I called Patton, spoke to a Major
    Smithey, PIO, Washington, D.C. ARC 600, 5th Floor, Dayton, Ohio.
37. N/A
38. N/A
39. Qualified NO. Has previously observed meteors, and has noted transit
    of artificial satellites at scheduled times. However has never seen
    any aerial phenomenon of such a nature as this.
40. Sighting observation was of geometry of artificial satellite into
    atmosphere.
41. Sighting satellite transit, which took several minutes to
    cross observable arc overhead, estimate extending somewhat velocity
    of observed phenomena as 5 to 6 times that of known velocity
    of satellite passage.
42. No, since I have no conception of size. However, since I believe
    this was a satellite re-entry, I would answer with its distance
    from 100 to 300 miles. But number of variables affect this
    altitude at which a re-entrant satellite would best be, and not
    being an expert on re-entry of satellites.
