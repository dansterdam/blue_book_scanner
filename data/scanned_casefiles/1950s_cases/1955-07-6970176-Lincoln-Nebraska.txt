SW to NE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One round, silver obj, size of silver dollar held at arms length clearly seen to be spinning while moving at a high rate of speed a/c SW to NE

11. COMMENTS
Check was made with COC whether at ADC with negative results. Observers possibly saw reflection of sun off a highly polished a/c. The non-technical background of observers would make it difficult to recognize such a phenomenon and the reflection could account for the large appearance of the obj.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1), round, silver object, the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, was clearly seen to be spinning while moving at a high rate of speed from the SW to the NE.

11. COMMENTS
A check was made by this headquarters with CO Weather at ADC with negative results. It is the opinion of this activity that the observers possibly saw the reflection of the sun off a highly polished aircraft. The non-technical background of the observers would make it difficult for them to recognize such a phenomenon and the reflection could account for the large appearance of the object.
