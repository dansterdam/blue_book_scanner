One (1) course, silvery object, the size of a softball, held at about 30Â° above the horizon. It moved with a high rate of speed from the SW to the NE.
11. COMMENTS
A check was made by this headquarters with GGO Weather at ADC with negative results. No reports of any unusual activity that the object may have been or the reflection of the highly polished aircraft. The non-technical background of the observer would make it difficult for them to recognize such phenomena and identify the precise appearance of the object.
