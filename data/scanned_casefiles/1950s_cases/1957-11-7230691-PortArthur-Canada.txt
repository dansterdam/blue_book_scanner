West

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Oval shaped obj, between pinhead & pea
size. Estimated to be 20 times the size
of Polaris. Bright white changing to
light orange & back to white. Seemed
to have bright haze surrounding obj &
some observers rtd early appearance
inside oval. Also had dark spot that
moved slowly in a counter clockwise
direction which gave the observers an
indication that obj was rotating about
one a minute. Haze around obj about 3
times size of obj. Changed to red when
disappearing over horizon.

11. COMMENTS
The elevations, azimuths of the
obj given here almost exactly
those of Venus' location & movement until its disappearance
over horizon. Definitely Venus.
Confirmed by astro charts, computers, ephemeris & current
astro journals.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
■ Was Astronomical/Venus
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
□ Other
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown

Here is the text from the document:

FINAL EXPLANATION: WOULD BE BALLOON WITH FLARE, HOWEVER WINDS UP TO 1,300 WERE ADVERSE, INTENSITY DID NOT DIM EXCEPT WHEN DISAPPEARING

A) Reported show that bright stars or planets, when viewed through haze or dense sky conditions, appear weird, unusual shape and colors

B) The electrics, against of the sky at given time, are almost exactly those of Venus' historic and movement until its disappearance by point

C) See attached Akron report, this shows clearly of this estimated altitude was too fast

D) View might have been 1/2 to 1/4 of its actual size. Lights only 1/16 of Venus. Balloon not picked up by radar. CONFIRMING MIGHT ALTITUDE PD

NORMAL EXPLANATION WOULD BE BALLOON WITH FLARE, HOWEVER WINDS UP TO
100 WERE ADVERSE, INTENSITY DID NOT DIM EXCEPT WHEN DISAPPEARING

* A Repeated show that bright stars a present,
when turned through haze or dense sky condition
after present wind, unusual shape and colors

are almost exactly those of Venus' feature and
movement until its disappearance beyond the horizon
