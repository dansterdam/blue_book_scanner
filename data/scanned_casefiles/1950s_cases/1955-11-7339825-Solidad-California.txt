PART TWO

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:

1. A check with the Combat Operations Center, 28th Air Division (DerF), Hamilton AFB, CALIF (DJNZ 2904) revealed that the AC & W site near SOLEDAD, CALIFORNIA (W/PQ 4126) had reported negative contact during the period in question.

2. The CAA Weather Station at SALINAS, CALIFORNIA, (DJRG 2041), stated there was no unusual weather phenomena that might account for the sightings.

3. Contact was made with the LICK OBSERVATORY, located on 4,380 ft. MT. HAMILTON (DJPH 2320), approximately 50 air miles north of the SOLEDAD UPOB sighting. Dr. Jose Jeffers, astronomer and member of the staff at LICK OBSERVATORY, made the following observations: At the time of the sighting, the planet SIRIUS was visible high in the southeastern sky, but it was not exceptionally bright, nor likely to be mistaken for a UFO. Mercury was not visible and Jupiter was definitely ruled away the possibility that it might have been Venus. The planet Jupiter rose at approximately 2400 hrs, and was bright, white in color. The planet MARS rose at approximately 0200 hrs, further to the East than Jupiter, and was described as red-yellow in color. There were no other unusual astronomical phenomena seen from the observatory on the morning in question.

4. Major MICHAEL S. KRETON, Officer In Charge, Project Moby Dick, VERNALIS, CALIFORNIA, (DJFH 4238) was contacted. He stated that no launching operations took place on the morning in question. Launchings occurred on 2, 4 and 5 Nov 55, but all releases were recovered.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by the planet Jupiter for the following reasons:

a. No other identification criteria are consonant with the reported facts of the sighting.

b. The planet Jupiter, bright and white in color, rose at approximately 2400 hrs on 31 Oct 55, and in the approximate location of the reported sighting.
Although the reported shape and size are unusual for a planet, I believe the SOURCES are mistaken in their report of these two aspects. The direction of movement (East to West), the rainbow variations in color, and the duration of the sighting all lend credence to the planet hypothesis.

c. Although the SOURCES claimed to have seen two objects, then fact that the distance which separated the two objects varied, and at times almost merged, plus the fact that the two objects always seemed to form a single illusion, is believed to have been an optical illusion.

Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was probably caused by the planet Jupiter.

APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (Agency)                    DATE OF INFO    DIR-UFOIB-2-55     PART ONE
        Det 1, 4602d AISS                                PAGE    3    OF    11    PAGES

Address:                Soledad State Prison
                        Soledad, California

Occupation:             Occupation: Inmate SOLEDAD STATE PRISON, 2 1/2
                        years. Telephone lineman.

Education:              High School Graduate

Qualifications:         GOC observer for seven months.

II. RELIABILITY: The four men who made the observation discussed in this
report gave almost identical stories. Since the observation was made from a
common point and under continuous exactly alike, the four men have been treated
as one composite source. All four are inmates of SOLEDAD STATE PRISON, assigned
to the Honor Barracks of the prison, which is located three quarters of a mile
from the main prison compound. Inmates assigned to this section are those who
have committed lesser crimes. These men have a record of good behavior
in the prison. They are very conscientious and very interested in GOC work and
volunteer for work with their GOC Sector. They have been commended for their excellent work by their GOC Sector Sgt. T/SGT M. H. GUTHERIE, Det 1, Sector 4, GOC.
SOURCES, during the interview, proved to be reliable and exact in answering questions. In the
opinion of the investigator, SOURCES are considered reliable observers and reputable. No attempt has been made to assess their reliability in any other aspect.

III. SOURCES' DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Team 1 was at the observation post,
SOLEDAD STATE PRISON on the 2400 - 0400 shift. At C109152 NOV 55, they observed
an object rising slowly from behind the mountains in the east. The object appeared to be a solid, spherical, bright white, and the size of a silver dollar
held at arms length. Almost immediately after this sighting, SOURCES observed
approximately one inch below, a smaller object, which they described as oval in
shape, bluish in color, and the size of a half dollar held at arm length.
(Refer to Incl #1 for Sketch.) Both objects appeared to be one cohesive unit,
always moving simultaneously and at the same rate of speed. At C109172 NOV 55,
team 1 reported the sighting to the OAKLAND FILTER CENTER.

The objects initially appeared to rise at an angle of 45° from the
eastern horizon, then slowly, at a speed estimated between 1 and 2 MPH, moved
in a southeasterly direction. It was estimated at 200 from T. North. Objects
were still visible in the southeast at C113302 NOV 55, when team 1 was relieved
by team 2. The objects had by this time climbed to an angle of approx 90° from
the horizon, and were at approx 135° from T. North.

Team 2 watched the objects move slowly from the southeast to the southeast
where they disappeared behind the mountain range in the southwest at 0113452 NOV 55.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (Agency)                                  REPORT NO.
Det 1, 4602d AISS                               D1-UFOB-2-55           PART ONE    PAGE 4 OF 11 PAGES

It was a bright moonlit night, cold, dry, windless and cloudless, with many stars visible. The objects did not appear to change in shape, but appeared alternately clear and then blurred. Objects appeared to be stationary at times; occasionally, the smaller object was obscured, drawing closer to the larger object, and then dropping down to its original position. There was no sound from the objects. Objects sometimes, but not always, appeared as the color of fire (yellow, orange, red and blue) when viewed through binoculars (7 X 50) several times within each hour of observation.

None of the SOURCES were spectacles, and all observations were made from an unobstructed, unenclosed platform.

"We first observed the object as it rose from behind the range
of mountains, the larger object appeared first, then later the
smaller one joined it. They both rose steadily then appeared to
stop. The smaller one then seemed to rise to meet the larger one,
then dropped to its original positions then they continued upward,
then changed course and traveled in a horizontal line."
