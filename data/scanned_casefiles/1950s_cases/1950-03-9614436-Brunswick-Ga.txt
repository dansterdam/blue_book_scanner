Here is the text from the newspaper article:

'Saucers' Fly Over Brunswick

BRUNSWICK, GA., March 9 -- Flying saucers were spotted over here between 11:15 and 11:30 o'clock yesterday morning.

Then were five of them, three in one group and two in another. They flew at altitudes estimated at 20,000 to 40,000 feet.

Those who saw the objects described them as a new type of American aircraft never before seen here.

Through binoculars the observers saw the disc-like craft which definitely were shaped like a plate, round in circumference but flat on bottom.

This description was substantiated by others, including four experienced aviators, Clarence Dubs and J. M. Rogers, both members of the Brunswick Airport Commission, were flying in separate small planes and spotted the "space ships" independently. They landed at the St. Simons Island Airport and found two other veteran pilots had been watching the strange craft from the ground.

The saucers left vapor trails across the sky that were seen by many persons who thought they were from an ordinary plane unusually high up.

The aviators together estimated the speed of the craft as from 1,500 to 2,000 miles an hour. The figures were obtained by estimating the altitude, distance covered, and time elapsed in flight.

The objects first were seen traveling south, then disappeared and were discovered again going north.

Dubs said the silver-colored objects probably are a new model of jet plane with a unique shape and extraordinary flying characteristics that have been kept secret during development.
