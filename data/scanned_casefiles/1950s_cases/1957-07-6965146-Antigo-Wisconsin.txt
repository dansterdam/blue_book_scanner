1. SYNOPSIS: Mrs. [redacted] interviewed 12 August 1957, stated
that while watching the sky from her home in Drexel Hill, Pa., she noted a
bright light, approximating an auto headlight in nature, moving down over an
area of an estimated 5-25 degrees of elevation in a path approximately as
directly east of her home. She was unable to describe the shape and
movement of the object other than as a 14 that moved too quickly to be
a plane and too slowly to be a meteor. U. S. Weather Bureau, Philadelphia,
Pa., reports no unusual weather or celestial activity noted on that date.

2. DETAILS:
   AT DREXEL HILL, PA.

   a. On 12 August 1957, Mrs. [redacted] Housewife, Age withheld
   (estimated as 35-50) was interviewed at her residence and accompanied
   by Special Agent MARCEL E. D'HOOGH.

   [redacted] related that she had seen a circular light, the size of
   half of the moon (also described as one-half the diameter of a dime held
   at arm's length) which appeared to proceed, the same color and half
   of the brightness of an auto headlight. [redacted] advised that there was
   only one or two lights visible about it. No trail, rail,
   sound, or any other unusual features about it.

SUBJECT: (Confidential) Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object at Drexel Hill, P.A., at approximately 615002, August 1957
SPON INTELLIGENCE REPORT CCPID(R)

She advised that she noticed this light while scanning the sky in the hopes of seeing the celestial phenomenon known as the "tears of St. Augustine." Stated that the light was at an altitude of about 65 degrees elevation when she first noticed it and that it traveled to a point of about 25 degrees elevation when it won't out of sight. Azimuth was estimated as 90 degrees throughout the one or two moments of observation. The light's disappearance from sight was attributed to passing behind the dormer of a neighboring residence.

Described the method of her sighting and observation of the light as ground-visual. No physical evidence of this sighting was available.

Time of sighting was estimated as between 1500-1530. Light conditions were described as clear.

Location of observer was determined as: 40° - 10' - North, and 75° - 15' - West.

Identified herself only as a housewife. Source claimed no military or other observer experience.

WEATHER:
a. Source was unable to describe the weather other than that it had been a clear night with no moon.

On 13 August 1957, Miss [redacted] Meteorological Aide, furnished Special Agent D1800E with the following observations obtained 612502, August 1957:

Winds Aloft:

NB Case (Information Only)                                   23 July 1957
                                                           Warren County, New Jersey

                    LOW-FLYING DISC FRIGHTENS EARLY MORNING FISHERMAN

July 23, 1957: Dominick Drago, a beauty-shop operator of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
was driving northeast on Route 521 in Warren County, New Jersey, en route to
Stanhope Lake (Sussex County) to fish. It was 5:15 a.m., just before sunrise. He had just passed through Squire's Corner, a little village about three
miles north of Blairstown. To the right of the road about a quarter of a mile
away is White Pond. Drago was driving up a slight grade with he suddenly saw
a large greyish oval-shaped object emerge from above a row of trees on the
left side of the road some distance ahead. It moved swiftly, to his right
(northwest to southeast) in a straight, level path at a 15 degree elevation
until it passed beyond the right side of the road, when it descended slightly
and made a sweeping counterclockwise U-turn toward the north and back toward
the road. Stopping abruptly, it hung motionless in the air to his right,
where between the road and White Pond. There it remained as the observer
drove past, and it was still there when he lost sight of it.

Its altitude was relatively low--it seemed to Drago to be no more than
a few hundred feet away from him. It appeared very much larger than the full
moon; by actual comparison with coins, it was similar to a quarter of a solid
arm's length, and tilted toward the observer from a horizontal position. It
was a sharply defined solid body, but non-metallic in appearance; its color
was grey. Like a dull matte (compare with previous reports), although darker
than the brightening dawn sky behind it, the observer was certain that the object had a slightly, colorless luminosity. The shape was definitely circular;
the bottom flat, or flattish; and the top might have been irregular, although
it was uncertain of this detail. He did not see any cylindrical rim, or edge,
as on a coin. When the object crossed the road, it presented a full ellipse;
while hovering, it was visible elliptical in shape, and more pointed at the
ends, and at this time it was inclined at a slight angle to the horizontal.

Mr. Drago had the object in view for at least two minutes, but since he
was driving, it was not under unintentional surveillance. It was still ahead
of him, and to the right of the road, when it commenced hovering, but he drove
on past and let it behind as fast as possible, for he was alarmed by its
sudden appearance and peculiar behavior. ("Nothing ever scared me before,"
he remarked to us, adding that, uncertain as to what it might do next, it made
him feel "trapped" in his car.) He finally lost sight of the object when the
car passed under a bank of trees further along the road.

Mr. Drago was interviewed in his home on Sept. 2nd by Ted Bloecher, Lex
Mebane, Ivan Sanderson and Stefan Santessano. We have Chester Ehrie to thank
for bringing the report to our attention. All the interviewers felt that Mr.
Drago was a thoroughly trustworthy witness and that he gave a straightforward
and unembroidered account of what he had seen.

THE UFO INVESTIGATOR

Missile Flight
Safety Chief Reports
Sighting of Large UFO

Nathan Wagner, missile flight safety
chief for the White Sands Proving Ground,
has reported the sighting of a "large, un-
identifiable object" between Las Cruces,
New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. This
report has added importance because of
Mr. Wagner's statement regarding the
possibility that perhaps may be involved
in near collisions on airways. (Story in
this issue)

According to Mr. Wagner, his entire
family saw this large UFO for 25 to 40
seconds while driving near the mountains
sighted, the object was heading east
toward the Organ Mountains. The missile
safety chief was driving to El Paso when
the UFO was first sighted by his wife, then
by both their children.

Mrs. Wagner, the missile expert said,
called it a "flying saucer." All agreed
that it was not a familiar shape. The UFO
was traveling so fast that by the time Mr.
Wagner had stopped his car for a good look
it had vanished.

July 25, 1957: While driving northward along Springwater Road, in Clackamas County, Oregon, in the vicinity of the Estacada-Springwater Highway, Brad Woodward and Carl Pollack, two county tax appraisers, were "almost blinded" at 12:35 p.m. when a brilliant disc-shaped object suddenly crossed the sky in front of them. They said the object resembled a "bright silver dollar" as it passed from their left to right at a "terrific" speed, about 150 above the horizon. "The object seemed to be spinning and was filled at a slight angle," are didn't hear the slightest sound or see any sign of a vapor trail, the men said. They had it in view only several seconds before it disappeared. From sight beyond the right-hand corner of the car's windshield. -- Oregon City Enterprise Courier, 7/23. (Since the object was definitely seen as a flat disc, there is no question of its being a daylight fireball; a fireball would have been reported by many observers over a wide area.)

THE GALT INCIDENT: From indefatigable Gene Duplantie; 1157 Saint Clair Avenue, 
West, Toronto 10, Ontario, Canada, besides the full account of the Galt incident, 
when a boy saw a source and later three-toed footprints burn marks on ground were 
found, we received the following comments: "I would like to add the following in-
formation about the Galt sighting. I spoke to Jack, and he told me and showed me 
various things the paper did not say. He also corrected some things the paper said 
and as he said, 'error'. There were three prints in the circular area as if it 
had a tripod landing gear. The distances were approximately 14, 15 and 17 feet 
between prints. Jack didn't go to the scene after it took off. He went home. It 
wasn't until Thursday that he and two friends went to view the scene. There was 
slight radiation activity around the ground. A Geiger counter, which has been 
checked by a local resident with a Geiger counter. An investigator for the NICAP 
organization visited the youth. The official preferred to remain unknown. The 
Royal Canadian Air Force up to then, hadn't investigated, which seemed strange to 
me."

July 30-Galt, Canada-bright, humming, silver UFO hovered over field, sent dog 
barking, then landed. & panicked witness. Newsman found several burned patches & 2 3-toed footprints (10 wide at toes, 18 long, taper). 
to point at heel). Corroborated by 2nd witness. UFO into ground, RCAF & Po-
lice made no comment. (I wish a Zoologist would investigate!)...(?)

"Monster" Theory Discarded in 
UFO Landing Case Witnessed 
in Galt, Ontario, Canada

An on-the-spot NICAP investigation of the Galt, Ontario "monster" story, which was 
publicized on August 3, 1957, has now been completed and no evidence of a hoax 
creature was involved, in the first known case of its kind. Careful checking of 
evidence indicates the incident cannot be explained by known means, and has not 
been discredited.

The story began when 15-year-old Jack Stephens reported having seen 
a round, one-stopped object four miles southwest of Galt on July 30. According to his 
signed NICAP report, the brightly glowing UFO hovered and then descended to about 
45 minutes. Then, after ascending vertically, it leveled out and disappeared at speed 
exceeding that of a jet.

When the UFO descended it made a throbbing sound, Stephens said. The lower part 
was aluminum colored; the upper part brighter, like chromium. In an interview with 
Ray Francis of the Galt EVENING REPORTER, Stephens said the domed top did not 
rotate, but the main body did revolve at high speed. As the machine hovered near the 
ground, he said, he could see a reddish flame beneath it. When the rotating action 
slowed down, its glow resolved into several small lighted areas, which he called portholes.

After the UFO took off, Stephens said, he was too frightened to tell anyone for 
two days. When the area was examined by two investigators, some broken branches, several charred 
spots on the ground, and indentations 18 inches long, shaped roughly like huge, 
three-toed footprints, were found.

An implication that it was a hoax—not

This suggestion, forwarded by NICAP's 
Special Adviser Wilson B. Smith, termed 
head of the Canadian Government's UFO 
project, came from Mr. Alfred Emond, 
who made a personal check on the Galt
