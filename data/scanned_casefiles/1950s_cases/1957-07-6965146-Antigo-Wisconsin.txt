1. SYNOPSIS: Mrs. Interviewing was interviewed 18 August 1957, stated that while looking up from her residence hill, Pa., she noticed a bright light, approximately 2 miles away, hovering and then moving very rapidly at an extreme altitude. It appeared to her to be about 1/2 the size of the full moon and was a very bright light, neither blinking nor changing in intensity. After 3 to 4 seconds of rapid movement, the object came to an abrupt halt, remained stationary for a moment, and then moved too quickly to be seen.

2. DETAILS: At ANTIGO, WIS. Pa. On 12 August 1957, Mrs. Housewife, Age 34 (witheld) was interviewed at her residence. She related that she had observed an unusual light in the sky at approximately 8:15 p.m. on 15 August 1957. She stated that she had been outside her residence looking up toward the Northwest and had observed a bright light, which appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet or more. The light was stationary at first, and then began to move very rapidly, covering an estimated distance of 2 miles in 3 to 4 seconds. The object then came to an abrupt halt, remained stationary for a moment, and then moved out of sight too rapidly to be seen. She described the light as being approximately 1/2 the size of the full moon and stated that it did not blink or change in intensity. There were no other unusual sounds or visual phenomena observed. Mrs. Housewife stated that she had not reported the incident to any authorities prior to being interviewed.

LOW-FLYING DISC FRIGHTENS EARLY MORNING FISHERMAN

July 23, 1957: Dominick Drago, a beauty-shop operator of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was fishing on a lake in Warren County, New Jersey, en route to Adelphia, New Jersey, where he was spending a few days' vacation. He was in a small rowboat about three-quarters of a mile away from the western shore of the lake.

Drago was driving up a slight grade when he suddenly saw a low-flying object hovering straight overhead. Drago stated that it was in a straight, level path at an 8 degree elevation and was about 125 feet long and 30 feet wide. It was shaped like a saucer and had a bright blue light on the bottom. As it passed overhead, the object made no noise and gave off a bright light that lit up the entire road.

Drago, becoming frightened, started to row rapidly to the shore. As the object passed, it hung motionless for a few seconds and then took off at a terrific speed in a westerly direction (northwest to southeast) in a straight, level path at what appeared to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. The object disappeared from sight within a few seconds.

Its altitude was relatively low - it seemed to Drago to be no more than a hundred feet from the water. It appeared to be approximately 125 feet in diameter and about 30 feet thick. There were no visible protrusions, and the object was smooth and without external markings or control surfaces. Its color was dull silver-gray, and it reflected the sunlight brightly. The bottom was flat, or flattish, and the top slightly domed. The color and configuration were distinctive and noticeable. There was a bright blue light located in the center of the bottom that illuminated the entire underside.

The object was flying at a constant speed and elevation and did not waver or fluctuate. There was no trail of vapor, smoke, or exhaust visible. The only visible change was the brightening and dimming of the blue light, which pulsed regularly and made the object seem to "throb" as it passed overhead. The witness was not under any sort of induced surveillance; it was still ahead of him and continuing on a straight course when it suddenly accelerated and disappeared.

The witness's appearance and behavior were normal. ("Nothing out of the ordinary that would explain it.") Drago was an ordinary working man, an American citizen of Italian descent, with no known interest in or connection to any unidentified flying objects. He had no explanation for what he had seen, and was quite shaken by the experience.

THE UFO INVESTIGATOR

Missile Flight
Safety Chief Reports
Sighting of Large UFO

According to Mr. Wagner, missile flight safety chief, an entire UFO was visible from Las Cruces, New Mexico, to El Paso, Texas. This large UFO, estimated to be about 50 feet in diameter, was first seen in Las Cruces and was observed moving toward El Paso. The sighting lasted for about 15 minutes, and it was observed by many people.

Mr. Wagner reports that visibility was excellent, and the sky was clear. He and his assistants observed the UFO through high-powered binoculars. The UFO appeared to be under intelligent control, and its maneuverability may have involved some type of propulsion system unknown to us.

According to Mr. Wagner, his entire staff was greatly concerned by this sighting, as they were responsible for the safety of missile flights in that area. They felt that the UFO posed a potential hazard to flight operations. The UFO was observed to make sharp turns and to accelerate to high speeds, something beyond the capability of any known aircraft.

25 July 1957 
Clackamas County, Oregon

July 25, 1957: While driving northeast along Springwater Road, in Clackamas County, Oregon, R.S. Pallette, manager of Pallette Box and Lumber Company saw a circular object moving silently overhead. He stopped his car, and he and his wife got out and watched the object for almost two minutes. They said the object appeared to be disc-shaped, silvery, and moving very rapidly. It suddenly disappeared into the sky in front of them. 

The object seemed to be of a bright glowing nature, and was tilted at a 45-degree angle. The family reported the sighting to the Blue Book Center at Altoona, Pennsylvania. The object was seen to be rotating or spinning and was followed by a tail-like projection as it suddenly disappeared. The object made no sound, and did not seem to disturb the surroundings. The sight has been reported by many observers over a wide area.

Text transcription:

THE CASE INCIDENT: From indefatigable Gene Duplantier, 1957 Brant Clair Avenue, Galt, Ontario, Canada. His report is as follows: On July 30 at approximately 12:30 a.m. we were awakened by a bright light, and as he said, "errors". There were three prints in a circular area as if some object had landed. We could not find any other indications of landing, but when we investigated in the morning as he said, "errors". There were three prints in a circular area as if some object had landed. We could not find any other indications of landing, but when we investigated in the morning the prints were still clearly visible.

"Monster" Theory Discarded in UFO Landing Case Witnessed in Galt, Canada
An NICAP investigation of the Galt, Ontario "monster" story, which was published in a national magazine in 1957, was inconclusive, despite claims that some horrifying "monster" was involved. Stephens said the evidence strongly indicated this was actually a genuine UFO landing, rather than any "monster" theory.

According to his signed statement, Duplantier said the object was about 50 feet in diameter and seemed to have landed on or near the ground. The area where the object landed or rested was found to have an indentation about 4 inches deep and about 10 feet in diameter. Stephens said there were three circular impressions or depressions in the ground, each about 18 inches in diameter and spaced about 3 feet apart, which could have been caused by the landing gear of the object.
