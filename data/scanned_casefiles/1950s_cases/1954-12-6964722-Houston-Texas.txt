analysis, and some published his complete data. The Ohio Chemist, along with analysis of the 1956 fragment. He did not determine the amount of thc present since this was not determined what elements their were in the sample. The density of the 1956 sample is not known and the complete quantitative and spectrographic analysis apparently are not available.

When a businessman sends a specimen to a commercial chemist for analysis, he expects to receive a specific list of contents. If it is received, well and good; if not, results such as those of the silver-nitrate analysis, plus the statement that the specific qualitative and quantitative analysis cannot be made owing to the small size of the sample, the businessman would very properly refuse to pay.

No information herein should be the measure data available to assert that the 1954 and 1956 fragments had an identical composition, or that they were the same material. It would appear to show only that a silver sample is composed entirely of a certain element such as tin, but if the sample size is very small, the analysis would be inconclusive.

With so few facts available, the actual identity of the silver rain can only be guessed at, but overquick conclusions indicate that it was made right here on earth.

The Problems of Identification and Analysis: The Air Force has a large number of what it considers to be original specimens ... however, some laboratory analyses have densities between 4.45 and 5.03, like the 1956 fragments, indicating the densities are consistent with stainless steel, chromium, nickel, or iron particles. the density of stainless steel is 7.9 per cent and the density of silver is 10.5 per cent. Many showroom soldiers have neither antitarnish nor protective coatings (from 0.5 to 12 per cent) and would indicate a density of 7.8 to 8.0 per cent, which is rather low for silver, but possibly consistent with aluminum, copper, cadmium, or phosphorus.

The scientifically experienced investigator, of course, would probably pointed out to the editor of the UFO Bulletin that the use of the word "prove" for the conclusions of the scientific investigation of these phenomena was premature, and that the need for complete analysis before drawing any conclusions. The editor, not familiar with scientific limitations, responded with the phrase, "It shows the need for a complete analysis."

"What more is necessary to convince so severe and thick-headed persons as Dr. _'s would be necessary a statement in conjunction with some highly worldly-considered scientific evidence". Would be necessary a statement in conjunction from Boston University, signed by the Loyal Professor, of course, that the phenomenon could not possibly be a UFO landing on his private garden? [1]

"SAUCER TIN"

We have no intention of giving the whole story of the molten "tin" that fell in Campbell Bragdon, on December 3, 1954, because, apparently, some readers are probably familiar with the main facts already. (If not, see Siness's Bulletin, 1/5 and 1/7 AFJRO Bulletins, July 1957.) But we should mention that this sample was carefully brought to New York by Siness, was disappointed everyone, because they dared to be composed of tin and lead. Their appearance, in fact, to be identical as besides which hardly suggests any extraterrestrial origin. However, this proves nothing certainly which should not be met all with some grains of salt, besides the fact that a sizable meteorite, similar in many respects, fell in Texas.! (The sample in the possession of Dr. Charles Maney is of similarly hazy certainty - it is still not really certain, and it will remain uncertain until someone examines in getting more information from Dr. Virginia Macel of Campinas, the chemist who examined it.) The action is still not justified in saying that this sample metal was of non-earthly origin.

THE FLYING SAUCER
October 1957

NO. 6
COMANDO DA DESCUISA LOS DISCOS VOADORES - CRDV - Box 8449 - Sao Paulo, Brazil.
CAPTAIN OF THE NATIVE

The Captain has returned to his native country after an absence of four days. It was his intention to contact several radio stations to interview and investigate the phenomena known to exist in the neighborhood. His visit was successful and he received the civilian saucer investigators interested in the work being carried on by the civilian saucer investigators. The Captain also had a chance to meet and talk together with Daniel, burn their brains along with others, regarding their experiences and experiments with saucers.

It would be utterly impossible to describe how miss Luly, Isabel, and Pedro were admired by the people of the region. Everyone wanted to see them, touch them, and take pictures of them. They caused a great commotion, and the press, radio and newspapers reported on their activities. Our readers may be aware the "railroad rain" of Campo Grande on last July 3rd, and that the "railway rain" seems to have fallen again following the same patterns. 

ROBERTO JOHN, PRESIDENT OF CRDV DIES
We have the sorrowful duty to report that our President, Mr. Roberto John, died last Monday November 4th. Mr. Roberto John was a Vice-President and a director of CRDV. His wife and a niece of his suddenly died yesterday. The body of his niece has been found. Requiescat in pace dear Norberto.

It seems that whenever someone comes up with something very new and very astounding, the "scientific official objects" and "critics in other worlds" an anti-natural thing is not long in making its appearance and disturbing the work. One instance is the "mirage" incident. Same corrections must be made in the former information: it seems in the "flying saucer" shape did not cast any shadow.

Our readers may be aware, as per Bulletin 7, that the "railway rain" of Campo Grande, on last July 3rd, was followed by a "railway rain" affair the following status:

1. A lady - whose name I cannot recall now - was found dead in her backyard, on December 20th 1954, something like what happened to that lady from Campo Grande, who on the same date died in her backyard.

2. From neighboring buildings someone could have thrown the metal rain. If that were the case, then the provocation shall be investigated. (Even if the metal fell by some of her neighbor's action it would still constitute a very grave crime).

The text in the document is as follows:

"It is very interesting to learn that neighbor got hold of such a peculiar sample whose strange composition can't be accounted for.

Apparently the composition cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, and its abnormal substance might have dropped from a flying electric wire. Handling of such a cable (this) would perhaps give a clue to its nature, and no explanation as to the origin of the sample is yet forthcoming.

The lady never said that she had seen the material falling from any objects, very low. It was quite an impression, perhaps she had gone through electricity as she reported to be tingling lightly. 

I assure you all, it is impossible even in South America.

The sky was clear, but a strange spinning flying object had been seen slightly earlier on the day of the incident. The floating samples were seen by others in the skies precisely on the day of the incident.

The Hagstrom caught the material end. Let us quote him from his review. "When a few flying saucers were seen, the object from which the material fell, was in a high altitude, one cannot see what was up there." He then that she was in her backyard when she noticed these flying saucers, but they disappeared very quickly. The material samples fell precisely after the saucers had disappeared, and the lady at once started trying to call the sheriff. After a few minutes my representative delivered the material to a chemist for examination. I have not yet received the report on this material. (Formation, Composition etc.) There was no sign that the material was a part of the flying saucer, but one of these objects flying over Campinas; then I confessed my eyes.

Reporter Danton Gomes and Professor Nascimento went to the Young Laboratory to examine the parts of the saucer. They told what they had seen. Laboratory announced that the parts to be 99.91% pure tin and 0.09% phosphor and carbon, said that the analyzed parts were similar in nature to those previously found that were called "o globo" which is 99.91% pure tin. The nature of the material indicates that it not a part of a flying saucer."

10. Just a few seconds after, while the sample was being examined, a "crash" was reported - apparently the result of the sample becoming too warm with resulting expansion and consequent loss of a small amount of the material. This resulted in only a small amount of the material being saved for further examination.

11. Sample Examination: As soon as practical, all screens of wind instruments on the sample piston of the vacuum pump were carefully opened (to allow the sample to become oxygenated) and wired in its base. There to have the material collected from "O Gorrell" (copy in possession of photographic copies of the cable and the photo data) by weighing approximately 5 grains (gravity) had to be handled with tongs. Dr. Howell also wired the base there to have the material collected from "O Gorrell's" (copy in possession of photographic copies of the cable and the photo data) by weighing approximately 5 grains (gravity) had to be handled with tongs.

12. Just before the sample had been delivered to the Air Force, the reporter was told to "censor" to the official "O Gorrell's report" in order to save the material with his own eyes. Denton Gomes took from his pocket a kit other than the one under the "censor" - to be the usual material. Since last Monday it has shrunk to half its size! It's incredible! Or am I being the victim of a hostile imagination? Last night at the insistence of a reporter, Denton Gomes said that he had no intention of believing too much in the interviewers, (who said they "would take the pieces").

13. Soon after GRV was found, in the spring of 1954, October Peard, Luigi Lunedi and his wife and several others (whose names I do not recall) came to the office. They seemed quite excited about something they had seen - apparently the living saucer No.3 was getting more active and that it was time Denton Gomes was told to take back one of the jars and with a pocket-knife pieces of the sample material, I kept the two bits for a long time in any will-seller. Some did not simply collect merely about two thousand fragments of the samples, but I don't remember to whom I gave it. Later I sent the "whole" round bits I kept to Lieutenant Chew, who as Lieutenant Chiasson told the "whole" collected all this.

14. Professor Nancy soon after wrote me a letter and made a preliminary point about his attitude to this problem. This psychologist was very furious, because, apparently, he did not always know some samples to the I.G. "where "normal" was a destiny of 7:3. Curious, this professor had asked for a "statement" of a person who had seen details of the sample, and now complained that he was not allowed to give further details and data.

The text in the document is as follows:

about his and Professor Manly's findings. CPYD got Professor Manly's version of Professor Manly's findings. Professor Manly said that although the case of the "Houston saucer" was classified as "Insufficient data to evaluate," the data was insufficient because of the very sketchy nature of the witnesses' observational story, to be judged or evaluated as describing a "flying saucer."  
CPYD quotes Professor Manly's comments as follows:
"15. HOUSTON, TEXAS (25 July, 1952) (The case in referred should have been July 25, 1952, not September 25, 1952. The investigative work was completed on September 25, 1952)
"People and told them everything," requesting them "to keep quiet" for a while. That is, the people were told not to talk about what they had observed.
"is possible to get information and then be prevented from making it public that is, prevented from writing it up or giving it out to other people."
"as possible and it seems to me that this case has in it something that merits public attention. That we got hold of last year and which I've been trying to do something about but which has, I feel, been suppressed."
"on an already completed subject. Just before my departure from Washington I had reviewed a case with Commanding General Samford and talked with him about his findings. At the time I was pretty sure that the case of the 'Houston saucer' was being suppressed..." 
"that I had found among his papers. At the time I was pretty sure that the case of the 'Houston saucer' was being suppressed."
"No, I'm not confident about that a great many of these are not cases of flying saucers." 
"Just looking at the two bits and pieces I can't say that "yes, they look like flying saucers" and I can't say that "no, they don't look like flying saucers," but they seem to me to be rather more in the nature of a 'natural phenomenon."
"So one may call a 'Professor Manly' over the phone and told him what was going on without any indication of having been cut out, we all listened. When we got Professor Manly on the line over the phone he said that he had given the two halves of some addressing material. 
The information and material given to Professor Manly was from the same source that had been analyzed by Dr. Mares. The lab work about the "saucer" had been done by Dr. Mares and when I saw him he told me it was being analyzed by Dr. Manly.  

The last word about the "saucer" by the end of September, realizing how serious I was about the whole subject he came in and we discussed all the details and he told me that the lady who claimed to recognize the "thing" as a "saucer" was not sure and yet the USAF considered this a valid sighting.  

to him I said that the lady who claimed to recognize the "thing" as a "saucer" was not sure and yet the USAF considered this a valid sighting. He replied that the reason for this was that the lady was a schoolteacher and was used to observing things in the sky. So the USAF used her observation as the basis for saying that this was a "saucer sighting." He said he didn't know why they did this to her and what she answered.

Q: Yes
Q: How many? 
Q: Where they spinning?
Q: What was the attitude of the UFOs?
Q: Did the UFOs drop anything when you were observing them? 
Q: Not when I was looking at them. But I remember I saw something fall from one of them once. It looked like some sort of material (metallic mine) because my house is high and surrounded by high walls. (I remember the lady meant to say "metallic objects" here instead of "metallic mine")

Here is the text extracted from the document:

"Please, describe the material. It was found near me, but soon after it solidified, it was quite hot, and I only touched it some time later. It seemed to be like some kind of silvery or metallic object and was disc-shaped and was like a record and spinning like a record on a phonograph. The three edges of the object rolled up and down and were rolling in and out. It was not hot when I touched it (the meaning has not been altered). By now, this material with the spinning object has been removed and concealed, so that there is nothing to be examined now.

It seems that the best guess is that there was a flying saucer, and it discharged some metallic object. The reports that have come in so far have shown that people in the vicinity saw a strange bright object in the sky, which moved very rapidly and was seen for only a short time. It was closing this letter when I received an information that a plane to Europe and returned only 10 days later, was dispatched on September 23rd.

We were closing this letter when we received an information that an American astronomer (a friend of mine) asking me to find out the nature of the material that was delivered to us, in the USA SAMPLE. He would like to analyze the sample spectrographically, which is the method Professor Von Braun has devised. I am therefore requesting a friend of mine, who is also an American astronomer, to write to you. Then we would have the result already obtained by Professor Von Braun's method. Please, let me know what is your decision. If it is impossible to get the material to the United States, this will be difficult but by no means impossible."

OCR Text:

LR. Mcbane thought that Dr. Visvalda Marcell never existed and that these was a possibility that this was a hoax. According to Mr. Mcbane, he has questioned the witnesses well and concluded that Mr. Cates and Mrs. Yascenio - it has been so far impossible to find Dr. Visvalda Marcel a real personage. 

It has been very difficult to determine to the complete satisfaction of all concerned just what did take place on Dunford Comes and Mrs. Yascenio. It has been far impossible to find dr. Visvalda Marcel a real personage to giving to Dr. Fontes the all-important material. If this fails all we have to offer is an interesting case from Panton Comes. It may take some time, but the case is by no means hopeless.

STATION'S VIEW

Those who have read our last issue are acquainted with the case we call the "A Tribuna" case, described in my code. Two specimens of what appear to be unidentified minerals are located.Perhaps the fact that the area is "hot" according to measurements of radiation, is significant. Mr. Fontes, our consultant, points out that signs of activity, such as scorched earth and fire-balls over that region is "a strong coincidence".

From the correspondence in Vitoria, we have received two clippings from "A Tribuna" of Vitoria newspaper. And here is what the "A Tribuna" printed on August 31:

"According to our correspondent, the inhabitants of the village of Alto Carlos, near the Espírito Santo have been seen flying over the skies of the Espírito Santo this past week. According to the villagers, at daybreak on August 26th a luminous object appeared in the sky and flew over the houses. It disappeared behind the mountains. Although it was an aircraft of some kind, because it disappeared behind the mountain, where there are no airports, the villagers believe that it was a flying disk. Yesterday, August 30th, at around 8 p.m., a light reddish in color flew over the village, coming from the east and disappearing in the west, at a very high speed. The object did not show any kind of navigation lights and moved silently."

On the following day, "A Tribuna" printed this: 

"According to reports received here, on the evening of August 30th, some residents of Cariacica, municipality located near the city of Vitoria, capital of the state of Espírito Santo, claimed to have seen a strange luminous object moving at high speed in the sky. The object was seen at approximately 8 o'clock in the evening, coming from the east and disappearing in the west, in the direction of the city of Vitória. The phenomenon was witnessed by several people, who described the object as a reddish light flowing smoothly and silently through the skies. Some say they heard a whistling sound that may have been produced by the passage of the object. Residents of Cariacica, who are considered serious and reliable people, claim to have seen the strange phenomenon and are convinced that it was not an airplane, since the object moved at a speed far superior to any known aircraft."

NOTE: FROM THE EDITOR'S YOU WILL NOTICE THAT MOST OF THE READERS SEEN OVER THE STATION'S VIEW CONFIRMS THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM BRAZIL THAT THERE ARE COMMON GREEN FIRE-BALLS.

Of the strange merciless movement observed in the northeast direction and to the benefits of Dr. Leon Davidson can say that there are several such cases presented here, and this should be seen as an interesting coincidence with Dr. Davidson's conclusions, although on the other hand, the appearance of green fire-balls is a common event in Brazil. They should be analyzed very carefully.

PAYING almost daily visits to Campinas and it was suggested that the "silvery
RAIN" fell from a saucer.

WHO was trying to do it now? All that it clear is that I would try to do as much
to try to help, but we all some questions to reason.

Complying with Professor Menes' suggestion, I want to Campinas on September
14, 1965. At that time a joint investigation was organized between the SBEDV
and the Campinas investigators for the purpose of obtaining further data about
this case.

We would broadcast by station P.R.G.9., radio observers at Campinas (individual
names cannot be verified) that we were trying to organize a scientific
investigation of the case and would welcome any information, clipping, or
data about the saucer that had dropped wastry material.

On the same date, that was sent a taped report to Dr. Visvaldo Maffei and
having the whole incident revised for proof seeker. Dentor said everything was
exactly as it had been reported. No further meetings of any kind was held to
discuss the case, and no additional information was obtained since then.

1. Yes. Here are clippings of papers to help my memory, but I don't think I
would remember too much of everything.

2. Does Dr. Visvaldo Maffei exist?

3. I have been unable to locate him. His name is not inscribed in the telephone
directory of Sao Paulo and I was told he is "no longer."

4. In Sao Paulo and I have seen him a few weeks ago. He works here at the
Paulista Laboratories and has a degree in chemistry.

5. Can I get in touch with him?
A: I'm afraid I do not have any current telephone or address information. (I have found no time: no time reply).

6. Who is the lady who saw the material falling from the UAPO?
A: Sorry, I cannot disclose the name of any individuals mentioned in the document. The document indicates she was a resident of Campinas and her husband is an impossible man and she would have a hard time if we asked her about it. It also states that she has lived in Campinas and I think you know her. Can I give you this even today, but I do not want to say her name.

7. So she is unable to sign an affidavit?
A: Yes, I would not want to disclose the name of the individual mentioned in the document who witnessed the material falling from the UAPO. While the document indicates she had the impression that something had flown overhead, I do not feel comfortable identifying her by name.

8. Could someone have thrown the molten material from, let us say, a high window or backyard? No dice. When the molten material became solid, she extended a grab and found it normal.

9. Many neighbors around I thought it was an almost desert place.
A: It was very easy to get in contact with her, for her home is less than 100 meters from the place where this occurred.

10. Where does Mrs. Benedito Gonçalves come in?
A: He is an inhabitant of the 1942 house and possibly met the lady who witnessed the event. The document states he is married and said it had almost destroyed their house, but he was out at the time, at least for him. Since we could not interview the lady at her home on that day, we went to his place instead.

Transcript of text from the document:

ACCOUNT OF HER HUSBAND MORBID JEALOUSY, SO MR. BENEDICT GONZALVES UNDERTAKES TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THERE WOULD BE NO DANGER OF HER HUSBAND ARRIVING SUDDENLY. (INTERVIEW) TO MAKE CONCLUSIONS FROM OBSERVATION.

Q: IT SEEMS THAT HE DESCRIBED THE MATERIAL AS A "SILVERY RAIN". HOW
A: (SMILING) I GUESS I AM GUILTY OF THAT. WHEN I SAW THE MATERIAL IT LOOKED LIKE SILVERY RAIN. WHAT I DESCRIBED WAS JUST WHAT I SAW.
Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK? (DOESN'T PRINT WHAT I SAID ABOUT MY OPINION). WAS IT A HOAX?
A: POSITIVELY NO. WHAT GIVES IT SUBSTANCE IS THAT THE ANALYSIS SHOWED SOMETHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE MATERIAL. IT WAS NOT ORDINARY. WHEN I SAW THE SAMPLE, IT WAS JUST LIKE SILVERY RAIN AS I DESCRIBED.
Q: WHAT ABOUT THE MATERIAL CONTRACTING?
A: (ANOTHER VOICE) WELL, I WOULD NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT DETAIL.
Q: WHY DID IT CONTRACT SO UNEXPECTEDLY?
A: I THOUGHT THE THING HAD DIMINISHED IN SIZE AND I ASKED, "WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?". THEN WE DELIVERED THE MATERIAL TO THE AIR FORCE. THEN WE DELIVERED THE MATERIAL TO THE AIR FORCE. JAMES SAID IT CONTRACTED SO IT WAS A FACTOR.
Q: THEN IT WAS JUST AN IMPRESSION?
A: OBVIOUSLY THE THING WAS CONTRACTING, BUT I WOULD NOT ASSIGN ANY SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THAT.
Q: WHO THEN SAW THE ROTATING SPRAY ALSO?
A: UNFORTUNATELY, THE ARTICLE DOES NOT IDENTIFY OR NAME ANY INDIVIDUALS.
Q: YEAH, BECKY. MR. GONZALVES INSISTED.
A: I KNOW HOW MUCH IS CLAIMED SOMETIMES WHAT...  THE MATERIAL CAME FROM ANOTHER PLANET OR SPACE, BUT.
A: NO- HE SAID HE WAS AMAZED BECAUSE EVEN WHEN THE MATERIAL WAS PRODUCED IN HIS LABORATORY, THERE WAS STILL A ROTATING SPRAY WHICH WERE NOT PRESENT WHEN THE SAMPLE WAS EXAMINED WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY SEEN.
Q: ACTUALLY, COULD IT BE THAT THE ROTATING SPRAY WAS SOMETHING FROM THE SAMPLE ITSELF?
A: HE DECLINED TO THE PRESS' BOYS THAT ASSUMING THAT IS FACTOR OR ATTRACTIVE CAN BE MISLEADING BECAUSE PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS. SOME OF THE MATERIAL THAT HE OBTAINED FROM THE AIR FORCE SHOWED SOME UNUSUAL PROPERTIES, BUT HE NEVER SAID THAT THE THING FELL FROM ANOTHER PLANET. HE SAID THAT IT COULD BE FROM ANOTHER PLANET OR ORIGINATED IN SOME OTHER UNUSUAL SOURCE.
Q: DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SAMPLE BEING SENT TO THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE?
A: I DON'T THINK SO.

Q- Do you believe saucers exist?
A - I can't help it, but I don't know what they are. I am open-minded. I have no opinion of whether or not they exist, as much looking-up, but no conclusive evidence.
Q - Some people say more than thirty people become saucers?
A - Yes. That was after we printed the lady's story or Mr. Gorman's story, if you please, in this area, of three nights we saw them go night after night.
Q - Would you take the position that all this material brought to the air force would not be enough?
A - Yes. It would not be enough. There is simply not enough evidence to the air force minds satisfied at the present time.
Q - What about the one you gave me last year, which I sent to Professor Manly?
A - That was a bit brought from someone, I don't remember who. I got it together with many other things. I have let Professor Manly have anything that has seemed to me to be worthwhile information to have. The analysis remains after the analysis, bring it back. Take this straw, please to, but mind that that from somewhere, come and bring this to me, and maybe the air force will have two similar even if the others may not bring them back, if possible.
EXPLANATION: The first interviewer asked whether I believe saucers or UFOs exist, and I responded that I don't have a definite opinion on the matter since there is no conclusive evidence. The second question was about a claim that more than 30 people became saucers, and I explained that we had previously reported on stories of multiple sightings over several nights in the local area. When asked if the evidence brought to the Air Force would be enough, I said no, as there is simply not enough evidence to satisfy the Air Force at the present time. Finally, regarding an item I had sent to Professor Manly the previous year, I do not clearly remember the details, but I indicated that I have tried to pass along any information that seemed worthwhile, even if the Air Force has not found it conclusive.

The text from the document is as follows:

"longer be done. if the members and subscribers wish the organization and publica- tion to continue regularly, rules must be established to do that. their feature - articles and writing of course is not corrected within the next 20 days a.r.r.G. will be discontinued.....
the funds of that we must say is deploring - the saucer book-sales just last year was good; however, i think there's hardly any appreciably funds being made to support the organization. i would advise a group of contributors, each contributing only a small amount be formed, to keep alive this good magazine. there is no fund accumulating and money to support this one serious and growing or- ganization. i would suggest a yearly subscription to be reasonable, such as 3.00 or 3.50, and that would help the printing costs, etc. it could be printed in three different languages and distributed to far foreign countries. it would help all of us and we would be really help solving the mysteries of the flying saucers. if contributors would volunteer without any profit motive, the organization could really be helping advancing our know- ledge. the directors would really be helping without any profit whatsoever, we could continue the bulletin to be sent flying to the world file.

at any rate, it is regrettable that our Bulletin no. 6 is facing a crisis. it is said in any previous letter, it is now our intention to suspend publication, unless strong re- sponse and action is taken star- ting january 1, 1958. "the flying saucer" will be costing more than it is receiving, and the organization will be discontinued. 

this reminds me: starting january 1, 1958 "the flying saucer" will be costing $2.50 for subscribers in the united states, and the members of C.R.I.F.O. $3.50 for member- ship and to receive the magazine. this is due to the terrific rise in printing costs, paper, post- age, etc. many times what it used to be. this means the publication and organization must exist thru your sub- scriptions and voluntary contributions, or else there won't be any continuation. we can get some merchandise and sell it; but it always comes out on the wrong side of the cards, although nominally they are worth much more. the instances n.j.-c. $1.55 and $1.78 are worth it but cost us almost double. see the differences - someone - i don't know who and whose from - has sent me some literature and asked me for the money - twelve months from now the money will be sent back to whoever remitted it.

at last: we will be getting up with the schedule. Bulletin no. 7 will be appearing in august 1957. information of new memberships will be seen by you follows both in europe and in the states.

"GIGANTIC SHAPED THING OVER BRAZIL

Very interesting information comes in about a huge luminous cigar-shaped object which was said to have been sighted over Brazil. The report states:
"A report from Manila do Sul, published by "Ultima Hora" on September 5, 1954, describes the sighting of a gigantic cigar-shaped object in the sky over Brazil at about 7:45 p.m. on September 4th. The object, according to the report, was about 6 miles long and emitted a brilliant white light. The object was observed by several persons and moved silently at a very high speed until it disappeared from sight.
It is worth mentioning that reports of similar nature have been coming up for some time and the press in Brazil has been full of accounts describing the sighting of such objects. This recent report seems to be just another in the series of similar happenings.

ASK. MINISTERIE: "I DON'T BELIEVE IT HAPPENED."

Regarding the accounts of 'saucer' apparitions over Brazil, the U.S. Air Attache in Rio de Janeiro, about the incidents said the following: "I don't believe they occurred as they have been reported. There are many more serious things to worry about than flying saucers."

EYE-WITNESSES:

There's an Aeronautical Technological Center near Sao Jose dos Campos, near Rio de Janeiro, where many Brazilian Air Force pilots and technicians are training. It is learned that several of these men, who are highly trained and experienced observers, have sighted such objects on many occasions. These men, who are certainly reliable witnesses, have given detailed descriptions of the objects they have seen.

Even if there are no photographs or other tangible evidence, the cumulative weight of the reports from credible sources should, in my opinion, make the phenomenon worthy of serious study by competent investigators. There are too many details in the reports to dismiss them as pure fancy. The observers have given coherent and temperate accounts of what they have seen. It seems to me that there is a strong case for a detailed investigation of these reports."

UNDER MY REQUEST.  IT WAS SEEN UNDER WRAPS BECAUSE THE NAME OF PROFESSOR CHARLES HENRY MANLY WAS INVOLVED.  NOW I HAVE HIS PERMISSION TO DISCLOSE THE FACTS.  SOMETIME BETWEEN NOVEMBER 20, 1954, IN CAMBRIDGE, MASSAHUSETTS, I BELIEVE A CURIOUS MATERIAL FALLEN FROM A UFO-LIKE THING.  IT WAS LATER ANALYZED BY PROFESSOR MANLY IN HIS LABORATORY AT M.I.T.  IT PROVED TO BE A VERY UNUSUAL MATERIAL, MORE THAN 12 MONTHS AGO.  I THINK THE STORY YOU PRINTED WAS MEANT ONLY TO DECEIVE, FOR I AM PERSONALLY CONVINCED THAT THE MATERIAL WAS REAL AND THE STRANGE AERIAL VISABLE MANLY HAD SAID THAT THE MATERIAL WAS A PART OF HIGH-INTENSITY BEAM, WHICH HE FELT PROVED THAT IT WAS A PHYSICAL SAMPLE FROM A METALLIC UFO.  I AM QUOTING FROM HIS LETTER.  IF GENTLEMAN WISHES TO GO ON THE BIT OF NON-FERROUS METAL WHICH YOU SO KINDLY SENT TO ME FOR EXAMINATION.  I OBSERVED THAT METAL BALLS AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE OF MR. CHRISTIAN IN CAMBRIDGE IT CONTAINS TRACES OF COPPER OR MANGANESE.  IT TASTE INDICATED VERY PURE TIN WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF TIN.  THE SURFACE IS VERY SMOOTH AND POLISHED.  IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT IS PROBABLY A PART OF SOME ELABORATE MECHANISM WHICH WAS USED IN PLACING ON A ROTATING STAND AS THOSE USED IN PLACING SMALL SAMPLES FOR EXAMINATION UNDER MICROSCOPE. IT WAS RETURNED TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, I CANNOT GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT.
DR. MANLY'S PROFESSOR LETTER DOES NOT INDICATE ANY TRACE OF ANTIMONY.  AND FOUND IT TO BE A VERY RARE SPECIMEN OF ITS KIND.  THIS DIFFERENCE IN ANALYSIS IS NOT EXPLAINABLE FROM THE ANALYSIS GIVEN. 
I HAVE A LETTER DATED APRIL 2, 1956 FROM OUR MUTUAL FRIEND JOSE ESCOBAR FARIA.  HE SAYS AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT HIS CHEMICAL EXAMINATION, ANALYTICAL BY DR. MANLY, OF THE FRAGMENTS RECEIVED FROM ME, PARIS, INDICATES THAT THERE IS NO TRACE OF ANTIMONY IN THE SAMPLE AT ALL.  THUS DR. MANLY'S FINDINGS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CORROBORATED BY THIS INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS.  THERE IS NOTHING UNUSUAL IN THIS FINDING, BECAUSE DR. MANLY IS A PROFESSOR AT M.I.T.  HE HAS NOT YET REPORTED TO ME THAT THE SAMPLE CONTAINED ANY ANTIMONY. 
I WILL NOTE THAT BOTH UNUSUAL FOR THIS PROFESSOR MEISS FOUND NO TRACE OF ANTIMONY, AS DID PROFESSOR MANLY.
AT THE BEGINNING, WHEN THE PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NON-FERROUS MATERIAL WERE KNOWN, IT SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN FROM UFO'S, MIGHT PROVE TO BE ONE OF THE RAREST SPECIMENTS OF THIS KIND, PROFESSOR MANLEY'S LETTER GOES ON REQUESTING FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS YEAR-OLD AFFAIR, AS I UNDERSTAND.  I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE.  I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PERSUADE DR. VISVALDIS MARIS SALPETER OF THE M.I.T. TO BE FURTHER RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDYING THAT MATERIAL.  BUT I THINK THE WHOLE AFFAIR WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY INVESTIGATED TO PRODUCE SOME TANGIBLE RESULTS.
I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE INFORMATION I HAVE, AND CALLED A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PERSONS, REQUESTING THEM TO GIVE ME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS PECULIAR PROBLEM, OR ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY COULD AND COULD NOT DO.
1. DR. GERALD HEUERMAN, MAY 1, 1956, SAN PAOLO, BRAZIL.
2. PROF. SHERMAN STEIN, DIRECTOR OF THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE BRAZILIERA, P.O.B. 1116, SAN PAOLO, BRAZIL.

3. Dr. Viswaldo Barrei (_no far I know so located him, therefore I suppose he knows nothing of what Professor Hanley thinks).

On may 21st he was told, also by a newspaper reporter said his presence would take effect on May 21st he would give a public lecture (audience expected 2,000) in response to an announcement by this newspaper reporter what he would do this date. However, no such lecture materialized and this statement appears as you can see is much more under or less substantiated than the information he gave me in our earlier conversation which was in a much more definite form.

Louis T. and state that all reports are sensible enough to warrant consideration, since the data was obtained and no further details added to the material when written up. When we were present his inside, call "science" is taken out of the usual place. On the whole its details seem impressive although I was not present when the material was discussed and cannot personally vouch for the accuracy of this or any other cases.

Here is "Professor Hanley" as he understands the positions of 1954 a notice of remarkable close range sightings of "balls of fire" were observed in certain localities over the Houston area. Government scientists who investigated the reports concluded the material was inconsistent and no definite conclusions could be drawn.  This man who daily chasing these materials said apparently the object was electric in nature. On their conclusion, the material was incandescent in nature. Ordinary sky observation discloses frequently the existence of incandescent phenomena in the sky, and I am not fully convinced that the recent series of sightings may not be due to some natural cause. Whether artificial or natural this material was inconclusive.  Just as on previous occasions, there is the usual tendency to endow the phenomena with all sorts of fantastic attributes. 

While her chickens, one and her neighbor her husband, had attended a circular object on the ground accompanied by a bright light. Usually the material was incandescent. Upon reaching the site, no physical trace of the object was found. According to the reporter, it is rather risky to accept at their face value many of the statements concerning these phenomena.

The metal that fell in Limestone Ct, Texas on September 23, 1954. At the time, the matter was investigated and the analysis made that the material was meteorological in nature. However, it would seem that additional analysis should be made of the fragments of metal before any definite conclusions are reached concerning the character of this material. The analysis made at that time was perhaps inconclusive so far as determining the true nature of the material was concerned

Dr. Kaplan which showed tin from the usual impurities found in what aluminum: the usual impurities found in the sample and possessed none seemed to indicate the material was genuine. A careful search was made to see if any trace of antimony was present in the sample. It seem that a trace of antimony was found in the sample and used in conjunction to the tin an antifounging used in forging of aluminum alloys. The density of this small sample was found to be 10.3 whereas the density of tin as given in published tables is 7.3. There was no further evidence to indicate the sample was tin.

Prior to the letter of Dr. Kaplan's findings which dealt with the chemistry of the sample, much importance was attached to the fact that the sample was found and there even a widespread and exiting feeling that some new and exciting discovery has been made which would be of great importance to the world and dealing with "flying saucers". Unfortunately, this feeling had to be discarded and it was found that this was no more than a piece of tin. This seems much more exasperating to me as the physicist who has been at work in this field of ultra high speed flight and the defense problems associated therewith than it would be to the layman or the average person. 

Assuming that the density of 10.3 is correct, (and in my opinion it is after having thouroughly checked the procedure) this sample is composed of 75% lead and 25% tin or something very close to this density. It may also be that this is a fusible alloy which may have some other use, however, the sample in question does not appear to be anything new or exciting. More records will be searched to determine its actual identity or origin but it seems unlikely to be other than a common industrial alloy.

"cables, and something very strange must be present, if there is only 11.1% of distraction possibly present on the land before accepting this conclusion."

"Now, I indicated requesting permission from the last CIOS-I assume that it is a easily determined that this land is a Holloman property of some nature, and it is noticeable that although accepting the liability, I am still within an acceptable distance of approximately 30 feet in his mind about the samples analyzed both by himself and myself. The sample sent to the air ministry, whereas according to the land specialist, was returned for further analysis due most likely to some strange material found in the area where the "silver craft" could have landed, was in the possession of a known defense plant.

Well, Dr. Meade says, "this is the piece of news I had for you." You may check the result of his analysis in "Chips, News & Comments" section of the file. Although it piques my curiosity, I am not at liberty to locate Dr. Meade and get a written statement from him. I also am going painstakingly slow in my investigation as I do not want to unduly jeopardize the material in hand.

I have appreciated very much your quoting of the "near dear dollar". It sounds as if you may have some knowledge of the distortions and misuses with which we are all too familiar. My best to you and hope to continue our correspondence on a personal basis whenever you find "my English" to be too obscure or too Latin-American.

Cordially yours,

I assume that readers have noticed the title of this entry: "Let us have no more of this entering on the basis of sheer fantasy from the beginning." The editor of "News Clipping Service" feels his personal-interest in the matter is slightly misguided, and in this case, information he receives is not accurate. All persons mentioned and the statements made herein are fictitious. This thing is serious enough without any fantasy being introduced. Pretty soon "readers will have some more deadly earnest."

DARIED: THE LATE PART OF JUNE 22 - 28. GIRPO Director Leo Stringfield and his charming wife Edith were in Cincinnati for a week of rest. The Stringfield's son Rick, grandson Ricky and other local GIRPO members, many of whom were introduced to the GIRPO Group and discovered for the first time that their membership were really members too, returned from their visit to the Stringfield home at the conclusion of this period. Issue No. 3 of July 25, 1957 was issued. By the way, Do you like these as ugly as to be indistinct?

No man a fellow called now know, please read GET Nava letter - Issue No. 6 and see what is now beginning to happen to contact seers and their followers. It is new and different.
WILLY LEX
Mr. Willy Lex writes letter that was recently published and indicates by Maneuvering and others in the air that he saw nothing that could be mistaken for anything resembling a 'very odd point' (a very good point indeed) or visitors from other planets. He also states that in June 1950 three bright FLUORESCENT objects were observed. That was new and was not even a secret lives for over 2 years. That he deserves lives for that may have impressed some people. I do not think that he is committed himself on anything saying that - who does seize him into the peculiar investigation and his mind goes the round. Perhaps the Government does not explain further himself. the matter speaks for itself and what he can do, so the Government certainly does not go into the exact government. An statement contents that no far science has failed to solve the problem he thought it solved"

Today Carabinieri seized many such balloons around and in Lake Trasimeno, Umbria. The balloons contained Anti-Communist propaganda leaflets written in Hungarian. It is believed that the adverse weather conditions in the past few days caused these balloons to fall on Umbrian soil--balloons which people mistakenly thought were "flying saucers."

Waukegan Trio Sights Fast Moving Sky Ball

Homeward bound members of an American Red Cross volunteer group, Mre. Dellamore, Mrs. Saunders and two young girls, companions were puzzled last night by a "trailing and moving sky ball" they described as seen in the sky over Waukegan, moving from south to north.

"We did not know what it was," said Mrs. Dellamore. "And none of us knew what it was."

Mrs. Dellamore said the sky ball seemed to travel faster than an airplane but not so fast as a shooting star. "It had no tail of fire and didn't know what it was," she added.

Mrs. Dellamore said the two other women were passengers in her car, which she was driving between Gurnee and Chicago. Martin and Orchard Aves., in Waukegan, when the unidentified object in the sky was seen."

Silver Rain in Brazil

One of the most publicized substances to be identified in this wey was the "silver rain" that allegedly fell from an unidentified flying object. The incident occurred on December 13, 1954, in the city of Campinas and the witness was a housewife, but, as in many UFO incidents, exactly what happened is not easy to find out [1]. UFO publications in England, New Zealand, and the United States revealed that the sighting had occurred at night, but, in spite of the darkness, the witness had observed the objects in detail. She described three gray-colored, circular flying saucers, each about 15 meters in diameter, which placed a plate rotated continuously and sent out a strong light. Moving steadily and slowly toward formation, the three saucers had performed fantastic acrobatics over the city, apparently unnoticed by the other residents. Suddenly, one of them had popped off and dived low over the roof of the woman's house, lighting up the whole neighborhood with the brilliant glare of its rotating section. Then, going into a high-speed climb, it dropped at her feet a liquid substance that "fell like silver rain." 

According to the more generally accepted and more credible version, the incident had occurred in full daylight. The woman, who was feeding her poultry when the objects appeared, saw them hovering at a short distance from the ground near her feet. Stooping down, she observed a pool of shiny liquid, the silver rain, which solidified within a few seconds, leaving up, she saw three large objects moving rapidly high in the sky and they looked like they were flying saucers.

A reporter on the Campinas Correio Popular, hearing rumors that a fit incident had dropped "strange material" something like "lead," interviewed the woman, collected some fragments that a local chemist for analysis. The newspaper then reported that the stuff was absolutely pure tin - that is, it was unlike any metal known to man. The sample contained no impurities or crystal alloys that are known on earth [1, 78, 79].

Understandably interested in this report, members of the Brazilian Air Force also interviewed the witness and collected some of the fragments she showed them, as well as other fragments that had fallen about the same time in other parts of the city. Laboratory analysis showed the material to be merely silica. Several large airports not far from Campinas might well have had large planes passing overhead at the time.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

GALLEY 87—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

In the air, which could have dropped the solder. The Air Force was apparently never able to locate the person who dropped the solder, and consequently, was unable to ascertain definitely that this was the cause of the phenomena, but Russian saucer enthusiasts refused to accept this explanation. In their opinion, the Air Force had other motives in its conclusion.

Two years later, in the autumn of 1956, the reporter who had conducted the original investigation of the U.F.O. incidents was convinced that the Air Force had deliberately covered up the unimpeachable data he had gathered. Although he did not know the names of the persons who gave them to him, he himself was convinced that they were part of the U.F.O. Air Force scientific team.

When the chief scientist of the U.F.O. project acknowledged the incoming information to be authentic, he did know from the names of the persons who gave him the data, that they were part of the U.F.O. program. This led him to suspect that the Air Force might have intentions to the United States government, possibly one part to a sympathetic scientist at an Ohio college who assisted a student collection to be the original and authentic discoverers with evidence to support his findings. The student claimed, when the U.F.O. project came to an end, that the material which had been in his possession had mysteriously been removed.

This led the scientific community to feel that they were being denied facts. When the U.F.O. group conducted their chemical analysis, they found that the amounts of the elements it contains were not consistent with his findings. The Ohio chemist reported that his specimen contained copper and had a density of 8.9, but the sample he analyzed contained other elements in addition to the copper, and had a density of 7.3, the sample he originally contained other elements it did not.

Events in addition to show the attitude of the Brazilian UFO Critical Bulletin published the aforementioned conclusions under the headline. "Such Analyses Apparently Dishonest," and discussed the significance of the fact that the person who gathered the data and turned it over to the Air Force had since mysteriously disappeared.

The full facts on which this conclusion rests should presumably be available for study. But these have never been published, and it is unknown, they may or may not have been part of the 1954 file. But the 1954 incident of at least officers believe that the conclusions reached above, based on whatever data was available then, are incorrect. They have been trying to track down the details of the 1954 incidents, and to determine whether it came from earth or from beyond.

The material did not disintegrate or disappear, as suggested, and individual waste may be, but remained available for analysis. Ultimately, this special evidence was lost or destroyed, and specific analyses, and some published his complete data. The Ohio chemist, busy with other duties, had time only to make a preliminary check but did not determine the amount of the present and did not determine what elements other than the copper that were in the sample.

Though the identity of the recipient of the data is not known, the fact that the public has been denied access to the complete evidence, and the attempt has been made to impugn the honesty of the original investigator, when the facts, if available, may prove to be quite different, indicates a reluctance by someone to have the whole truth known. When a controversial sample is concerned, as in this case, photographic tests, if performed, are not available.

When a controversial sample is concerned, as in this case, a competent chemist would use the meager data available to assert that the data was inadequate to characterize the sample, but would not use it to draw a conclusion that something untoward had occurred. The chemist's opinion that the specimen used was not consistent with something the Hydrometeorological Service would very probably have found. If it is shown that the specimen was consistent with natural materials, this would not necessarily prove that it was not part of the U.F.O. which had been recovered.

With so few facts available, no competent chemist would use the meager data available to assert that the data was inadequate to characterize the sample, but would not use it to draw a conclusion that something untoward had occurred. The evidence indicates that the public has been denied access to the complete data and that attempts have been made to impugn the honesty of the original investigator, when the facts, if available, may prove to be quite different.
