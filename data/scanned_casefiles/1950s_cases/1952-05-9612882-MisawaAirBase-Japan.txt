IR-2-52                                                                16 May 1952

STATEMENT

On 8 May 1952 at approximately 2200 hours I was walking my guard position around number four gun at "A" Battery. As I looked up in the sky I saw what appeared to be a flare. The light seemed to burst between 150-200 feet approximately one mile north of my position. The light first appeared to be a bluish color until it burst and changed to white and faded. Approximately 20 minutes later I noted another of the same type flash and at the same position, but this one didn't seem to go as high into the air.

STATEMENT

16 May 1952

I was walking out to my post at "A" Battery at approximately 2205 on 8 May 1952 when I caught a glimpse of a flare in the air approximately one mile north of "A" Battery. The flash appeared to be red in color and had a long tail reaching approximately 200 feet and then dropped and faded. The flash seemed to last about 2 minutes.
