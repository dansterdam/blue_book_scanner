The observer's attention was drawn to the object when the "shooting stars were sighted shortly before the UFO". The UFO was described as appearing extremely high, with an incalculable height. It disappeared in a southeasterly direction, and the light of the object faded out gradually. The observation lasted for one minute and 30 seconds. The observation was made through ground visual means, with no optical aids.

DIG, Hq 164F, AFO 283, 19 Aug 58, Subj: Unidentified Flying Object Report (UFO)
Air Force - Despite the considerable interest of the observer, the sighting was not informative, and a preliminary analysis by the preparing officer of the possible nature of the UFO sighting is as follows. The UFO sighting was not unlike that of a shooting star and pending receipt of any information qualifying the observation further, the reporting officer interpreted the above report as a meteor.
