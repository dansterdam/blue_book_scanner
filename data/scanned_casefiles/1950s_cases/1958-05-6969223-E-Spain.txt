DIC, Hq 164F, APO 283, 19 Aug 58, Subj: Unidentified Flying Object Report (UFO)

k. Capt. Randolph J. Splett. Intelligence Officer, 16th Air Force. Despite the credibility of the observer, the sighting just prior to the UFO sighting is significant and a preliminary analysis by the preparing officer of the possible cause of the UFO sighting is as follows: The UFO sighting was not made that of a shooting star and pending the receipt of additional information qualifying the above report the reporting officer interpreted the above report as a negative UFO sighting.

FOR THE COMMANDER:

RUSSELL J. GARDINIER
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Operational Intelligence Div.
