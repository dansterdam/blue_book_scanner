OCR output:

1. ON 8 June 1954, at 2330 hours, an explosion of fragmentation cluster bombs occurred in a restricted ammunition area in Red River Arsenal, Texarkana, Texas. TWO blasts in rapid succession, within seconds, approximately 150 yards apart, left large holes in the ground and uprooted trees over a large area, creating considerable damage and debris scatter over the surrounding area for a distance of 150 to 300 yards. No one was in the area at the time of the explosion, except the driver of a military vehicle. Damage to this vehicle was minor and the driver was not injured.

2. On 9 June 1954, no cause of the explosion had been determined, but it was the opinion of Colonel Airup that there was a minor electrical storm in the area at the time, and that the explosions may have been accidental. Preliminary examination failed to disclose the possibility of sabotage.

3. On 8 June 1954, at 0100 hours, Mr. Hooks, a civilian guard at the Depot Division, Red River Arsenal, who is reported by the Military Intelligence Officer, Red River Arsenal, to be a reliable and conscientious observer, observed about 5,000 to 10,000 feet altitude but moving downward, a traveling light, which he could not identify. The object was bright and toward the west-northwest, and the Red River Arsenal. The object was about the size of a grapefruit, or smaller, and made a humming sound which he heard for about 30 seconds. Shortly after he heard the explosion in the direction of the Arsenal. A copy of his statement is attached.

Extract from letter report from Ord Corps, Red River Arsenal, Texarkana, Tex, 8 June 1954, to CG, Fourth Army:

This letter describes an incident on 8 June 1954 involving a civilian employee of the installation and an unidentified aerial object. The employee reported seeing a bright aerial object that did not seem to have fantastic tendencies. He was very sincere in furnishing this information. The information has not been released to anyone except the Commanding Officer of this installation.

This incident is submitted in conjunction with an explosion of a reverent in Area D, Red River Arsenal, occurring on 8 June 1954. The explosion consisted of two blasts in succession, with sparks ascending approximately 150 feet. The explosion left a large hole in the ground, and scattered cans and fragmentation bombs were in the vicinity of the explosion. Debris was scattered over Area D and a portion of Area E. Ammunition storage facilities were considered over Area D and a portion of Area E.

STATEMENT BY MR. GENERAL SUPPLY
DIVISION. RED FIGHTER ARSENAL
My name is [REDACTED] and I am employed by General Supply Division at present in Building 82. My residence is in Hooks, Texas. North of town. On the 3 June 1954 I saw approximately 1:00 A.M. this morning to take the children to the cellar. A heavy cloud was coming up. I took the children to the cellar and child said it was a red star. I was going to sleep. There I want back to the house and stopped at the house again the noise kept coming I said what was that a cloud come up and said don't know. I did not know what it was behind the cloud shining through the cloud and saw it was a star. As a matter of fact, it came from under the cloud and went up and a white solid sound. And as a matter of fact over my house travelling towards northeast and that light died away from me. It was some two minutes after it disappeared from sight there was an explosion in the direction of the Arsenal, which frightened my wife. I carried her to the cellar and returned to the house to check the time and then. The fan did not stay in any room that time it was 2:37A.M.
Q. Are you familiar with a comet in the sky?
A. I have seen two fall in my life.
Q. Did this object going over your house have a tail similar to a comet?
A. No, it was not exactly a shooting object. It was also had a noise and this comet I saw fall had no noise except for the explosion after they had fallen.
Q. Approximately how high would you say this object appeared to you?
A. As nearly as I can guess, it was higher in the northeast and was lowering. When I first sighted it, it appeared to be approximately 3 or 10 thousand feet high and approaching from underneath the cloud. It was travelling at a rapid speed.
Q. Did this object pass directly over your house?
A. It was the air.
Q. What was the size did she appear to be?
A. As nearly as I could tell from the light, I would say between the size of a star and the size of a dime at arm's length is not very large.

Statement: Mr. Lloyd T. Prewitt, 3 June 1954.

Q. What was the weather condition at the time you saw the object coming over?
A. It was cloudy overhead with a heavy dark cloud in the northeast that had passed north of us, trailing some out of it.

Q. You have been in the service?
A. No, I was called out. I was not up ready to go, but I did not go.

Q. Exactly what type of noise was it that the object made?
A. Similar to those sky rockets that go up and make a shriek, only it was more prominent and had more buzz to it.

Q. Did anything else see the object?
A. My wife only saw the light. She became frightened from the light and the explosion that followed.

Q. Did you mention this to anyone else in the morning?
A. I mentioned it to the man next door who resides with me. Mr. White. He spoke of hearing the explosion and it jarred his house, but he thought it was lightning that struck. I believe he said his wife had noticed a light just before the explosion. He also mentioned it to a dispatcher who works at the air base. He has been in the service. And to a dispatcher who works at his residence. He thought it was lightning.

Q. When did you know of the explosion on the Arsenal?
A. Definitely, I did not know until I returned in my insurance papers this morning, other than hearing a rumor of a small explosion and knew something had blown up.
