There is a photograph at the bottom of the page. The image is quite grainy and it is monochrome. There is a noticeable vertical streak towards the right side of the photograph, possibly representing an object moving at high speed or a photographic artifact. The rest of the photograph appears to contain noise or grain, without any distinct shapes or features.
