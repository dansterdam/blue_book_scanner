An Unidentified Flying Object sighted in the vicinity of St. Petersburg, Florida was reported to ATIC on 12 Sept 55. Object was sighted at 0825 EST (CPTN) by a young man and his mother who reside at _____ in St. Petersburg. Sighting was observed for approximately five (5) minutes from a wooded floor through cover. Elevations of 8 a 56 were utilized during most of sighting period.

Object was described as first appearing as shown in attached sketch (Incl 1A). When first sighted was then an arrow in sketch, then (P2), when first looking through binoculars prior to focusing the binoculars. After the glasses were properly brought into focus, the object appeared as a white or silvery and of oblong period. Gradually, while peering, which made his vision somewhat distorting his view, served to another vantage point on second floor wide porch with no screen and objects appeared to be about 1/2 mile distant. Then on the watch (P3), appeared to grow gradually from first cross (?) with a light from the originally viewed with naked eye and gradually became smaller and smaller until at disregarded completely. At no time did object appear to be moving at any direction. Object was observed to be approximately 1500' in the air and not more than 1-2 miles at a slant range from point of observation, which would place position of the object about over the beach along Gulf of Mexico to St. Petersburg. Estimated position of sighting by coordinates 27 (lat 85 long).

Object appeared to have no distinct outline, but because of the different size of the individual windows from which a white light radiated, gave the impression that several, the object was round in shape. Object was described with port-hole type opening which were definitely counted to be in a line of four (4) on a horizontal and six (6) on the perpendicular. More and others were visible during view of sighting, but not in a position to be indicators with line of sight to object. Light from bottom row of windows seemed by radiates descend through the opening revealing its windows, and light from the upper windows appeared to glow above altitude of the object. A hazy glow of diffused light appeared to penetrate the sky surrounding the object at all times during the sighting.

Significantly, the sighting made a deep impression on both observers and their immediate neighbors. The feeling was that a close approach was actually frightened and at the same time fascinated by what he saw.

No other sightings were reported to this installation during period covered. A check with USCR revealed no unusual activity.

Object appeared as shown in sketch 3A part of the time, and as shown in 3B part of the time. Observer believed these two sketches to be good examples of how object looked through focused binoculars. Light diffusion could possibly have caused observer's uncertainty as to positive shape of openings.

The document contains three hand-drawn sketches:
1. A sketch of an object with an oval/elliptical center and two smaller circular/oval attachments on either side
2. A sketch of multiple small geometric shapes/marks arranged in a grid-like pattern
3. Two sketches labeled A and B, with A showing a grid-like arrangement of geometric shapes similar to sketch 2, and B showing a more scattered arrangement of circular/dot-like shapes
