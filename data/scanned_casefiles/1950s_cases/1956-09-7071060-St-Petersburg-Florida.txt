2. The observer, a resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, called the Office of the Officer of the Day on 22 September, stating that he observed a "UFO" on the same date. The observer stated that he was moving some furniture in his yard when he noticed a peculiar object in the sky which he watched for several minutes. As the object moved closer, he was able to obtain a fairly good view of it. He described it as being circular in shape, having a dull gray metallic surface, and emitting a blue-white glow. The object appeared to be rotating slowly and moving in a westerly direction. No noise was heard. The observer estimated the size of the object to be about 30 feet in diameter. When the object had moved to the west, it simply disappeared from sight. The observer related that this was the first time he had observed such an object.

TEXT OUTPUT:

SUBJECT: SUPPLEMENT TO REPORT

An unidentified flying object sighting in the vicinity of St. Petersburg, Florida was reported to the 1516th Air Force Base Unit, MacDill AFB, Florida on 25 Aug 55. Colonel was assigned to investigate this sighting which occurred during the afternoon between 1645 and 1715 hours, EDT. A resident of St. Petersburg reported that he observed an object approximately 1000-1200 feet in altitude, traveling in a northerly direction at a very high rate of speed. He estimated the speed of the object to be between 600-800 mph. The object was observed for approximately one minute by both the witness and other citizens in the area. The object appeared to be white or silver in color, and was emitting a flame or exhaust trail. There was no sound reported by the witness.

The witness was a male, white in race, approximately 60 years of age, and was considered a reliable observer. He was previously employed as a control tower operator at a U.S. Air Force Base, and has had considerable experience in observing aircraft in the sky.

It was the opinion of Colonel that this sighting was a true unidentified flying object. There were no known aircraft or other explainable objects in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. The witness was interviewed in detail, and his story was considered to be credible. No further investigation was considered necessary.

It is recommended that this report be accepted as a case of an unidentified flying object.

The text in the document states:

Object appeared as shown in sketch 3d part of the time, and in 3d part of the time. Observer believed these two sketches to be good examples of how objects looked through focussed binoculars.

Light distortion could possibly have caused observer's uncertainty as to positive shape of objects.
