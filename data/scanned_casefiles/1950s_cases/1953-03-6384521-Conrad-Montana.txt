There is no photograph present in the image. However, the image contains a scanned letter from the Ohio State University's Emerson McMillin Observatory, dated May 19, 1953, addressed to 1st Lt. Robert Olsson of the Wright-Patterson AFB.

The text of the letter is as follows:

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing film (duck) officially go through, I shall be glad to send you a checklist with comments for each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method is the one I shall try from now on and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

As to this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting items. I might mention the 25 March 15, Scott case which was a Possible Greeen fireball, and the following usual case of discounting those of 8 April was a meteorite.

The Great Falls (3 April) case was Venus if reported correctly.

28 March Albrook AFB case was possibly Venus.
31 March Kennebu, and 30 March Lyls, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have meteorites.

The 8 April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

There was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this? Anything more come in on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-bottle but it should be listed as nocturnal meandering flight.

12 March Spokane, Wash. Duration 50 minutes sighting here. Hard to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one that is still bothering me.

I hope you receive more dope on it. I am sure this latest batch as I described it would be fairly typical of the next interesting cases of the batch, and I hope you receive more dope on it. Is there any possibility that ducks have been eliminated?

Sincerely,
Allen Hynek
