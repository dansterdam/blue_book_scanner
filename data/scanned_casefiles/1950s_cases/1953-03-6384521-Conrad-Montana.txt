1st Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB,

Dear Lt. Olsson;

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss Gluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case, so that you will have my comments on each folder. The letter method is has obvious drawbacks, but until that time comes and she can handle my typing and completion of forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 4 really interesting cases. I might mention a 5th, 28 March 53, Scott AFB, which is the last report I've seen of an honest to goodness mirage. 6 Cases have only one observer and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.

8 April was a meteor.
The Great Falls (3 April) case was Venus if reported time was in error.

28 March Albrook AFB was pr/obably Venus.
31 March Honolulu, and 30 March Lyle, Wash., are puzzling but could possibly have been balloons.
The 8 April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

This brings us to the interesting cases:
25 March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm surprised there was no radar pickup. Was there any aircraft like helicopters that might explain this. Anything more come in on this one? Don't think this is good enough for a pinch-hottle but it should be listed as Nocturnal Meandering flight.

29 March Spooner, "isc: Duration times needs checking here. Heard to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one of the regular questionnaires should be sent to Cr. Cilcote.

Next is the 12 April Stead AFB. I think this is the most interesting case of the batch, and I hope you receive more dope on it. Questionnaires should be sent-if I like to see them explain this one! Is there any possibility that these could have been aircraft? Apparently ducks have been eliminated.

As of the 16 March, Equasseur AFB although NUL, the data are geographically insufficient. Perhaps this was a helicopter? We ought to know much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,
Allen Hynek
