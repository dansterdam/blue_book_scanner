ATIC Conclusions: ASTRO

1. Astro chart indicates bright twinkly star ARCTURUS
BLUE at that time, and at rather high elevation
(approx 50 degrees). Seen the
position you & others

2. As no other given
spot could be the UFO app.
Waxler stated his place
"scattered - just moving bands"

3. These, say bright star - being about

4. Scattered fighters, and
darkness up - noting
unusual event.
