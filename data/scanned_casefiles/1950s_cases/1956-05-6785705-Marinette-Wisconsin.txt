SUBJECT: Marinette, Wisconsin, UFOB Sighting                   28 MAY 1956

TO:   Commander
       Air Technical Intelligence Center
       ATTN: AFOIN-Hql
       Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
       Dayton, Ohio

1. Reference "Marinette Case" and telephone conversation of
15 May 1956 between Captain G.T. Gregory, ATIC, and S/Sgt DeRudder,
this headquarters.

2. Forwarded herewith for action deemed necessary is ATIC Form 164
completed telephonically between UFOB observer, Reverend[redacted] 
and Flight 3-A, 4602d AISS.

3. Review of the attached form indicates that this sighting was
possibly astronomical in nature. The following items would substantiate
a meteoric hypothesis:

   a. Unrestricted visibility of the heavens with the exception of
   a few scattered clouds.

   b. One object, although moving behind a cloud, was still visible
   with a change in color indicating this was not a reflection but a self-
   illuminated body.

   c. The short duration of sighting of each object or group of
   objects coupled with the distance traveled again indicates meteors.

   d. The fact that the observer did not have sufficient time to
   see the object(s) through binoculars indicates the celerity of the objects.

   e. The color of the object(s) is that of meteors.

SUBJECT: Follow-up on Marinette Case

To:    Commander
        Air Defense Command
        ATTN: 46024 AISS
        Colorado Springs, Colorado

1.    Reference your basic communication 23 May 1956 regarding meteor hypothesis submitted on the sighting observed by Reverend Charles Burmeister of Marinette, Wisconsin, and teletype message, ATTN, dated 14 May 1956, requesting additional information on subject sighting.

2.    A review and analysis of this sighting has been completed by a USAF consultant and scientist on astronomical matters. In light of present information, it was disclosed that it is very doubtful that reported objects were meteoric in nature.

3.    The following are submitted in support of the above contention:

    a. Meteors do not travel in formation.

    b. "U" shaped formations, definitely not characteristic of meteors.

    c. Observation of three separate groups, also not characteristic of meteors.

    d. Observer, being an amateur astronomer, would recognize or have general knowledge of meteoric phenomena.

4.    Request that the same basic questions submitted in teletype message, referenced in paragraph 2 above, be considered as part of your 'follow-up' action towards properly resolving this case.

[redacted] Marinette, Michigan, who is also amateur astronomer. This case warrants attention. Action to investigate undoubtedly under way by your office. Proper analysis of this case towards some firm conclusion require the following data also be obtained, which not indicated in original msg:

a. Msg states duration of objects sighted 1 hour. Does this mean all three formations?

b. What was time duration of each formation?

c. What was the time interval between each formation?

d. What was the significant difference between the three formations, as to size, shape, color, maneuver, motions, etc., if any?

e. Obtain details as to approximate speed, movements or maneuvers of each formation. None given.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(Case)    Am attaching all the correspondence from the
last visit to Columbus. I thought it would be best if you would
review my letter to the WSCO reporting they re-enter the case. As
you may see from the correspondence they insist the objects seen by the
good reverend are meteors. Perhaps I have phrased the letter in an
erroneous manner, on the statements in rebuttal of their meteor hypothesis
may be miscontrued. You may revise it as you see fit. I am attempting
to "demand" a re-investigation and get specific answers to your original
TK questions - without being too blunt.

I will follow up on the (case). I think the
best thing to do is for me to correspond directly with
I can say that I happened to be talking to you at ATIC and got
interested in it because of its astronomical implications, and
thus I need not disclose my connection with the project. O.K?

If I may digress to the (case), may I submit the following
suggestion as being of some possible value towards resolving the meteor
hypothesis. Is it possible for you to contact and consult with
astronomers (not amateurs) in the (area) and determine whether
there was any unusual meteoric activity or astronomical phenomena for the
night of the sighting which could have some bearing on the alleged
observation? This is definitely not to question your professional
integrity or opinion, (for I consider and will be your stalwart
champion in my USAF matters), but for purposes of having some paper on
file indicating you have evaluated all sources to appear or disappear
the hypothesis. This is in keeping with our policy of getting all
opinions, evaluations, analysis, results of investigations, etc. -- "on
paper".

f. How did phenomena differ when viewed visually and through binoculars?

g. Was it possible, under the existing circumstances and conditions, to determine whether the object had its own source of light or was light reflected?

h. If the latter, would be interesting to know if the light was diffused, specular, etc.

Above items are submitted for consideration, only in the event your investigation and analysis cannot place sighting into explainable category. In reply or query to this matter, also reference "Marinette Case."
