Here is the OCR text from the document:

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

[First paragraph is partially illegible]

not in Pegasus at all, but in the neighboring group of Andromeda. This constellation represents the Ethiopian princess who, according to mythology, was chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea monster, represented by the constellation of Cetus, while in the south, Fortunately, she was rescued by the hero, Perseus, who is seen in the northern sky.

Andromeda's mother, Cassiopeia, is seen above Polaris, the pole star. Alongside her in her husband, the king, Cepheus.

Turning now toward the east, we can see what is generally considered to be the finest constellation in the sky making its debut for the season.

This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized because of the three stars in a row that form his belt. To the left is Betelgeuse, to the right is Rigel, both of the first magnitude, although being so low in the sky they do not appear as bright as they will later.

[The rest of the text describes star constellations and includes two star charts showing the night sky in November 1957]

At the bottom of the page, there is a legend: "SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS"
