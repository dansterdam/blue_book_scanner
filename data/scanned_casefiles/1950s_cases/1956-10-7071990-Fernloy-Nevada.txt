10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One cigar-shaped obj of approx 172 ft length & 30-40 ft width was sighted at approx 2000' alt appearing approx 1 length of obj initially stationary & then traveled to 320 deg az where it disappeared. Obj appeared to hover the majority of time. Upon disappearance, obj speed was out of sight in approx 7 to 10 seconds. Obj viewed visually & thru binocs for 40 to 45 minutes.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other:
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation

SO. COMMENTS
British United Airlines, course & height & position checked. Radar tracking on [397]647z estimated to be 25 mi. of aircraft. Check w/ATC forecast center. Possibly location of balloon. Obj been close to not of sighting. Could be mirage, not supported by data. Obj speed was distinct exhaust relatively low alt; high rate of speed at disappear- ance. Exhaust, possibly might be high speed vehicle. Not enough data to make sharp conclusions.

Here is the text from the document:

JOINT MESSAGEFORM

[Most of the header fields are blank]

APPROXIMATELY 3,000 YARDS DIRECTLY OFF THE HIGHWAY AND APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER A SMALL HILL. BY ESTIMATING THE HEIGHT OF THE HILL, HE OBSERVED THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT TO BE 5,000 TO 7,000 FEET, HOWEVER, HE READILY ADMITTED HIS ESTIMATE WAS ONLY A GOOD GUESS. SHORTLY AFTER SETTLING OUT OF HIS CAR TO BETTER OBSERVE THE OBJECT, IT COMMENCED TRAVELING IN A NORTHEAST DIRECTION AWAY FROM IT AND HIM. JUST AFTER IT STARTED TO MOVE IT WAS ABLE TO FOCUS HIS BINOCULARS ON THE OBJECT AND GET A MUCH CLEARER SIGHTING.

IT WAS THROUGH THIS STUDY THAT HE DETERMINED THE OBJECT TO BE CIGAR-SHAPED AND SAID HE OBSERVED THAT APPEARED TO BE OPENINGS OR APERTURES ON THE FUSELAGE BUT DUE TO THE RAPID SPEED OF MOVEMENT, HE COULD NOT GET AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF SUCH OPENINGS. ACCORDING TO HE, THE OBJECT BORE ITS FLIGHT FROM A HOVERING POSITION AT 250 TO 300 MILES PER HOUR AND ACCELERATED RAPIDLY TO A TREMENDOUS SPEED WHICH HE COULD NOT ESTIMATE. FROM THE START OF MOVEMENT UNTIL THE OBJECT WAS OUT OF SIGHT APPROXIMATELY 7 TO 10 SECONDS ELAPSED. OBJECT TRAVELING ON A LEVEL COURSE ON A CONSTANT HEADING UNTIL OUT OF SIGHT.

AND HIS WIFE THEN CONTINUED TRAVELING TOWARD FERNLEY, NEVADA, UNTIL HE WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES FROM FERNLEY AND STOPPED AGAIN TO LOOK BACK. AT THIS TIME WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE SAME OBJECT AS AGAIN OBSERVED IN APPROXIMATELY ITS ORIGINAL POSITION. THIS SOLE SIGHTING WAS AGAIN MADE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF FERNLEY, NEVADA. ALTHOUGH THE DETAILED ALTITUDE AND VAGUE DESCRIPTION OF THIS OBJECT LEAVES NUMEROUS QUESTIONS UNANSWERED, THE FACT THAT THIS OBJECT HAS CRUISED PRACTICALLY IN FRONT AND THEN BEHIND HIS OBSERVERS IN THE COURSE OF TRAVELING 20 MILES, SEEMS TO PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING IT AS A STAR EFFECTED BY UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS. IN THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL IDENTIFYING OR CONFIRMING DATA ON THIS SIGHTING, NO DETERMINATION AS TO POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE CAUSE CAN BE MADE AT THIS LEVEL.

12. NEGATIVE.

The document is a Joint Message Form with standard form fields at the top, and the text appears to be describing a UFO sighting near Fernley, Nevada.
