STATEMENT OF LT. W. S. GATES, 2s4692i/i3ii, USN
27 April 1954
On 22 April 1954 at 2300, namely 1500 hours UT, my crew and I while on night patrol some 27 miles off the south-east coast of San Nicolas Island, California, U.S.A., during routine operations, sighted an unidentified aerial object in the sky.
The object appeared to be brightly illuminated, approximately 1/2 the apparent size of the moon, and was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes. It was moving at a high rate of speed, and made radical changes in direction and altitude. The object was completely silent.
We were unable to take any photographs of the object as our camera equipment was not functioning properly at the time.
All hands aboard ship saw the object, and were in agreement as to its description and behavior. We were unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the object.
