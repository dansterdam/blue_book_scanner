STATEMENT OF STEPHENS, James B., Jr., SA, 295 54 19, USN                   23 Apr 1954

On San Nicolas Island on 22 April 1954 at approximately 1100 local time, I sighted an unidentified flying object. This object was sighted while proceeding down the main road between the Operations Building and the Camp Area, vehicle in tow, riding in a Navy Carroll F/307 and was driven by HALL, Kenneth G., Jr., SA.

Something attracted my attention to the right side. I looked and sighted a clear shaped object very in color and appeared to be approximately 14 to 15' in length. It was traveling just above the ground and appeared to be in two other areas of the ground. It was open. 150 direction of travel indicated it would cross the road ahead of us.

Almost immediately, it hit the ground in a semi-flat attitude and a cloud of dust or smoke spread beyond the point of impact. After impact, nothing were was seen of the object. I was under the impression that HALL's view the object. We stopped the Carroll and made about a twenty (20) minute search of the area.

Upon finding nothing we returned and told our story to LT W. S. CATES, the Officer-in-Charge of San Nicolas Island.
