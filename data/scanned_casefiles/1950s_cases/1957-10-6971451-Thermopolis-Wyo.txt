Pilot Sees Fireball Fall
After Near Collision

DENVER, Oct. 10- A brilliant ball of fire described as large as a house, blazed across western skies in the pre-dawn darkness today. It whizzed so close to a Navy plane carrying 38 persons that the pilot had to make a sharp turn to avoid a collision.

Scientists said they are sure the flaming object was a meteorite and had no connection with the Russian satellite launched last week.

The Navy transport plane pilot, Lt. Cmdr. W. F. Norris, said after seeing the fireball, he circled over it and saw it crash in rugged country near the Colorado-Utah border.

Headquarters of the North American Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs said flyers will search the area east of Myton, in east-central Utah.

Airplane pilots and night fliers all the way from North Dakota to Utah told of seeing the flaming heavens under illuminating the sky.

Capt. E. A. Anderson, who was in the plane's cockpit when the fireball was seen, said:

"Anderson said the object flashed by the left side of the transport plane and appeared to have burned out about 1,000 feet below the plane. The plane was flying at 17,000 feet at the time and was some minutes past its checkpoint at Myton, Utah.

"An Air Force bomber pilot, Lt. George Wortell of Cleveland, said he thought for a time it was on a collision course with his plane.

"When it passed instead of near us, excitement turned to awe. We, cockpit crew, turned to gaze. It was a blue-white fire only five or 10 miles away."
