AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Directorate of Intelligence, SAC     5-380-2

The following report of an unidentified flying object was forwarded to this Headquarters by Major Filch, 1st Ind., 8 September 1952.

1. At 1930 hours, 24 August 1952, an unidentified aircraft was tracked by the operations personnel of the Casablanca, using MIG-15 electronics equipment. The aircraft was first contacted near Marrakech. I was immediately notified and proceeded to the control van to view the track. In this instance, it was not like to record a track of an aircraft. The point was 117.5 miles per hour. Absolute altitude above ground level was 20,000 feet. The track was erratic and is noted in Figure.

2. The aircraft continued on a southerly heading until past the city of Marrakech and was then tracked again. In the control van, an northerly heading was established. After starting on the north heading, it started to descend, and was at approximately 20,000 feet altitude when over the area of Agadir.

3. Upon subsequent personnel viewed the aircraft through the telescope attached to the radar periscope.

4. Requested description of aerial aircraft at Port Lyautey to determine if captured aircraft illustrations were similar to any in use there. The answer was negative.

# 75 Huicy St., Cordova,
San Juan, Puerto Rico
June 4th, 1954.

Col. Radford P. Schuman,
Hqg. (72nd Strategic Reconnaissance Wing),
Ramey Air Force Base, Aguadilla,P.R.

Dear Sir:

The following is my story on what I saw on June 2nd.:

Originally I started on a trip with my family from San Juan to Sabana Grande via Ponce and Guayanilla.

We were getting close to the town of Guayanilla when I detected something in the sky which resembled the moon. I glanced again and had the impression it was moving. To make sure I stopped the car I was driving and so I confirmed the moon was moving". 

Thereupon it was no room and I really a flying apparatus. I pointed this "thing" to my mother who was by my side and also to my father and my sister who were riding in the back seat. They also acknowledged the phenomenon. They saw as I saw the flying object coming from Ireland, from a northeasterly direction towards a southwesterly direction.

The "moon" was coming down like a glide swirling from side to side. Last speed, it was 8:12PM Wednesday June 2nd and we were close to Kilometer 14, I guess, close to the gasoline place, the sea on the left side and the mountains at the right; the "moon" coming from the side of the mountains.

As soon as I realized the "moon"was moving I continued our trip but always watching the "moon". Then the "moon" was illuminated in the crown and in the half-front sides of the arch. It was dark and the center part though somewhat but real slightly illuminated was rather dark and so the roar of the moving object. The color of the light was reddish or orange firelike. There was no sound and I guess the light was 4 or 5,000 my be more than that in ft.

When the source left the ground area and came into the sea area it did a sharp turn of about 90 degrees and instead of flying, sideways it took a direct course towards the horizon. The lights increased in size with the distance. The farther it got the red blur of the lights became more noticeable and large state of orange and red wire seen in the distance.

I do not call the military authorities at that time because I thought they had surely spotted this "visitor" in their radar screen for this location. I am sure is within range of Ramey Air Force Radar system if any.

I saw the "saucer" for at least 2 or three minutes before it got to the beach then it took around one minute to disappear in the long horizon. I calculate the thing is around 100 feet in diameter or less or more.

My father is a former Postmaster of the town of Sabana Grande and he is now 75, a healthy and strong man mentally speaking. He has a fine background and he knows how to differentiate and appreciate things very well.

His name is Miguel A. Franco-Soto. Address of Postmaster Sabana Grande, P.R. by address is the Assistant of the Postmaster of Sabana Grande in my brother Junet. She is 61 and as bright and alert as my dad. She can not be fooled easy either. Her name is Carmen Soto, same address.

My sister is a graduate of Sion Heights College of Adrian, Michigan. She is now a Pun American Airways employee and she is bright and clever. As the others she knows to differentiate things. Her name is Leslie Franco-Soto and lives at 4605 Mirmar Ave, Cadiz Building, Apt.#2 Santurce, Puerto Rico. She is 25.

As for me I have two years college pro-legal course and I work as a Customs Inspector for Uncle Sam. That kept me sick having stomach trouble but this did not interfere with my senses at all. I know pretty well what was going on.

While I stopped my car I tried to stop a car with non-resident plates to make them aware of the saucer. They did not stop but I showed "flying a saucer" and pointed to the sky. The car continued its march.

I am enclosing a sketch comparing it with the other saucer I saw on August 25, 1952 at which time I reported it next day to Col. Sanders of CIG in San Juan by telephone. On that occasion the saucer was silvery colored and it shined all over. I saw the same direction from northwest to southwest. This one I saw at 2AM over the town of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico in the southwest tip of the island of Puerto Rico. I was also with my family. The distance from center I might say 10,000 ft any and it still looked like a nickel. This one just have been at least 200 ft or more in diameter. The edges were brighter than the belly of the upper part. The movement was long, slow sidewise but at great speed. It turn on and turned off the lights at intervals. There was no reflection from moonlight when it turned off its lights.

I projected the lines of the path of these saucers and on the point of origin it starts from Moscow in Russia and on the point of Destination we have Colombia, Venezuela, the Galapagos Island, the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean.

I recommend a 24 hour watch over the island of Puerto Rico for cut of two trips a night I have detected two flying saucers. That puts me in 1000 points. That is, in case none of our aircraft have been over our area in these positions and time.

Respectfully yours,
Harding Franco-Soto

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aircraft over Marrakech, 
Morocco on 20 August 1952

1. Report of subject sighting states that an unidentified target 
was picked up on an AN/MPQ-2 radar set at 1000 GMT 20 August 
1952 over Marrakech, Morocco and that radar crew personnel 
continuously sighted an aircraft throughout these contacts 
to the radar antenna. The speed of the aircraft, as determined 
from the east, was 1157 miles per hour and altitude above 60,000 
feet, the maximum recording capability of the radar equipment.

2. It was determined that a USN AJ-1 aircraft was over 
Marrakech at the specified time.

3. The sketches prepared by the three personnel who observed 
the aircraft through the telescope exhibit very good agreement and 
together are remarkably similar to the configuration of the AJ-1.

4. Observation is therefore evaluated as an AJ-1 with a mal-
function in the radar plotter resulting in an error in the speed and 
altitude determination on the order of three. Dividing the speed 
and approximate altitude by three gives a corrected speed of about 
350 miles per hour and an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet, 
both reasonable figures for the AJ-1.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT:

1. Prepare a Memorandum for the Secretary of the Air Force.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION:

2. In a cover sheet comment from AFOIRL-2 this office was asked to prepare an evaluation of a report from the Directorate of Intelligence 5th Air Division regarding the radar/visual sighting of an unidentified aircraft on 25 August 1952 over Marrakech, French Morocco.

3. The report stated that at 1030 GT, above date and place, an unidentified target was picked up on an AN/FPS-3 radar set and a track recorded on plotting paper. Recorded speed at one point was 1127 miles per hour and altitude above 50,000 feet, maximum capability of the radar set. In addition, three radar personnel observed the aircraft through the telescope attached to the radar antenna.

4. The originator of the report determined that a USN AJ-1 aircraft was over Marrakech at the specified time.

5. The attached memorandum states the evaluation by this office, viz. that the aircraft was the AJ-1 in question and the speed and altitude recorded probably resulted from a malfunction in the radar plotting equipment.

6. A photograph of the AJ-1 is attached to the memorandum along with the report of the 5th Air Division.

7. This item is not considered suitable for inclusion in the Daily Staff Digest.

ACTION RECOMMENDED:

8. It is recommended that the attached Memorandum for the Secretary of the Air Force be approved and forwarded for General Sanford's signature.
