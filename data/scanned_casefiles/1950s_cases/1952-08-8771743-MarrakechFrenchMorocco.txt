Dear Sir:

The following is my story on what I saw on June 2nd.:

Originally I started on a trip with my family from San Juan to Sabana Grande via Ponce and Guayanilla.
We were getting close to the town of Guayanilla when I detected something in the sky which resembled the moon. I glanced again for I had the impression it was moving. To make sure I stopped the car and looked at it. Suddenly it was no longer a stationary object but was moving. I pointed this out to my family and they also confirmed the moon was moving. It was moving at a good rate of speed and I could notice it was not and exactly a circular shape. They also acknowledged the phenomenon. They saw it I saw the flying object coming from inland. The "moon" was coming down like a glider. I was able to discern its outline against the night sky. The nearer it came I noticed that it assumed a definite circular shape. As soon as I realized the "moon" was moving I continued our trip but there was something unusual about the object. It seemed to be emitting a bright light which case a glow on the surrounding mountaint
As soon as I realized the "moon" was moving I continued our trip but there was something unusual about the object. It seemed to be emitting a bright light which case a glow on the surrounding mountain. 
As soon as I realized the "moon" was moving I continued our trip but there was something unusual about the object. It seemed to be emitting a bright light which case a glow on the surrounding mountain.  
The object continued on its course and disappeared over the mountain range. There was no sound and I guess the flight was very silent. It passed at a considerable distance and I did not dare to stop the car for I had the impression that family was rather scared and so I did not want to infuriate them any more than that. The color of the lights were rather reddish as orange or some similar livish. There was no sound and I guess the flight was very silent.

When the same left the ground area and came into the sea area it did not return of about 50 minutes and sight of flying activities it
took a direct course towards the horizon. The lights appeared to rise in altitude and spread.

I did not call the military authorities at that time because I thought they had sufficient data within range of "Ramey" Air Force radar system if any.

Text from the document:

I drew the "conceal" for at least 2 or three minutes before it got to the beach. They must have circled around for quite some time to disappear below the horizon. I calculate the thing is around 100 feet in diameter.

My father is a former postmaster of the town of San Juan Grande and he is now retired. When his truck driver saw my sister making two passes over the town at a very low altitude, he became frightened and stopped the truck. He said A. Franco-Soto, address c/o Postmaster San Juan Grande, observed the same thing at about the same time. She is 61 and as bright and alert as any girl. She can not be mistaken.  

My sister is a graduate of State Heights College of Adrian, Michigan. She is now a Pan American Airways stenographer and clerk. As the chief she knows to differentiate things. Her name is Lucia Franco-Soto and lives at #205 Luis Muñoz Rivera St., Hato Rey, San Juan, Puerto Rico.

As for me, I have two years college, I'm a postal clerk, and I work as a customs inspector for the UNA Pan Am. That is all I can say, this is a true story and I did not interfere with my senses at all. I know pretty well what was going on.

While I stazed my car I tried to stop a car with no-accident plates to make them come to my rescue. They did not sop but I shouted trying a answer and they whizzed on by.

I am enclosing a sketch comparing it with the other saucer I saw on August 26, 1952 at 12:15 p.m., which came I reported it next day to Col. Bernard of CID in San Juan. It covers the blue color that I mentioned. The object was silent, glowing with a pale blue luminose color and power. This is all I can give at 20 over the town of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico in the southwest tip of the island of Puerto Rico. I was also with my son with 10,000 feet of film and it still looked like a nickel. This one I might say looked at least 500 feet or more in diameter. The edges were brilliant white. There was a center shaft or gun which showed at great speed. It turn on and turned off the lights at intervals. There was no sound whatsoever from the moonlight silent craft.

I projected the lines of the path of these saucers and one the point of origin is the island of Venezuela, the Galapagos Island, the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean.

I recommend a 24 hour watch over the island of Puerto Rico for out of two trapped airplanes that night I have detected two flying saucers that put in 1,000 frames. This is in case some of our aircraft have been over our area in these positions Indian.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The following supplemental information was received from MAJOR HALLER a.
Transcription of a ground radar record of an unidentified aircraft was received from the 3020th RADAR EVALUATION SQUADRON.
A ground radar track of an unidentified aircraft was obtained at approximately 2247 hrs, 23 July 52 over the Marrakech area in French Morocco. The track lasted approximately 12 minutes and showed the target travelling on a heading of approximately 090 deg true, at a speed of approximately 250 kts.
The target acquired an altitude of 15,000 ft during the track and disappeared from the scope at 2259 hrs at a point approximately 50 miles southeast of Marrakech.
Comment:
The radar track and information received appear consistent and describe the observation of an unidentified flying object.

Based on the image, there does not appear to be any photograph present. The document appears to be a memorandum for the Secretary of the Air Force regarding the sighting of an unidentified aircraft over Marrakech, Morocco on 8 August 1952.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aircraft over Marrakech, Morocco on 8 August 1952

1. Report of subject sighting states that an unidentified target was picked up by an AN/CPS-5 radar set at 1030 GMT on 8 August 1952. The target was simultaneously sighted by an air crew through the telescope and visually through the windshield of the aircraft, was determined to have a speed of 137 miles per hour and an altitude above 30,000 feet, was under observation for 15-20 minutes.

2. It was determined that a USN AF-1 aircraft was over Marrakech at the reported time.

3. The sighting was observed by the three persons who observed the aircraft through the telescope as exhibiting very good agreement and together are considerably similar to the confirmation and mission of the AF-1.

4. Observation is therefore evaluated as an AF-1 with a malfunction in the radar plotter resulting in an error in the speed and altitude determination on the speed of target. Providing the speed and approximate altitude of three times a corrected speed of about 400 miles per hour and an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet.
