COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
This object was observed visually and on the radar scope by the pilots of the aircraft performing the ECM mission on 11 January 1958. The object's speed, maneuverability, and visual characteristics observed electronically and visually appeared extraordinary, and the efforts to uncover any conventional explanation of the phenomenon were unsuccessful.

ORIGIN OF INFORMATION: DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, HQ USAF, WASHINGTON, D.C.

a. SAC Combat Control Center, Rlason A.F.B.
b. 5025th Radar Evaluation Flight (ECM), Elmendorf AFB
c. 91st FIS, Elmendorf AFB
d. 317th FIS, Elmendorf AFB
e. 5040th ACW Group, Elmendorf AFB
None of the agencies mentioned above acknowledge having operational flights or knowledge of operational flights in the area of sighting on 11 January 1950.
1. The ADAC flight following indicated control of monitored aircraft, but Northwest Orient Airlines flight 285, proceeding from Anchorage to the Great Circle or 269 degrees as follows:
113:22:37 53 55 N 175 00 W
113:29:22 54 25 N 177 00 W
113:35:27 54 55 N 177 20 W
113:41:22 55 10 N 177 40 W
At approximately 13:45Z this aircraft intercepted the course of the F-89-F which appears to have descended (see above) to an altitude of 11,500 feet. The aircraft were reported in this area.
COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
After investigation of military and civilian agencies knowledgeable of aerial operations in the area of the sighting, no further informa- tion could be obtained which would tend to identify the unidentified objects. Correlation cannot be made as to the alleged or the observed object with those facts contained in the report. The indicating factors showing aircraft flights in the area of sighting have been reviewed and the estimates of the participating observers would indicate the possibility of the sighting of the ballooning lights which were seen, however, this office has found no physical evidence to substantiate or verify the accuracy of the report.
