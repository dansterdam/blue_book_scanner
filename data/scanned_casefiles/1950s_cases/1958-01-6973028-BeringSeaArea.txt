None of the agencies or units mentioned above acknowledged having operational flights in the area of sighting on 14 January 1958.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

The objects sighted by the Navy patrol bomber appear to have been possible aircraft in view of the flight characteristics observed electronically and visually, however, investigative efforts failed to uncover any identification of friendly aircraft in the area at the time of sighting.

h. 5015th Radar Evaluation Flight (ECM), Elmendorf AFB
11 31st FIS, Elmendorf AFB.

None of the agencies or units mentioned above acknowledged having operational flights
or knowledge of operational flights in the area of sighting on 11 January 1958.

2. The Adak AACS Flight Following Center which assumes control of scheduled
military and civilian flights beyond 160 degrees W Longitude as they enter the Adak
Control Zone, indicated that Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 285, proceeding from
Anchorage to Shemya, had radioed its positions along a True Course of 261 degrees as
follows:

111812z 54 55 N 171 00 W
111910z 54 05 N 177 05 W
111953z 54 05 N 177 50 W
112103z 52 40 N 175 40 E

At approximately 1900Z this aircraft intercepted the course of the F27-5F which
reported the sighting (see sketch 1). No other aircraft were reported in this area
at the time the objects were observed by the F24.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

After investigation of military and civilian agencies knowledgeable of aerial
operations within the area of the report, the positive identity and origin of the USOB
remains unknown. Data received in the original report indicates possible aircraft;
however, correlation cannot be made of the airspeed of the objects with those of
aircraft known to be operating in the area at the time of the sighting. The fact that
Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 285 passed within a 20 mile radius of the observing
aircraft might explain the phenomenon of the blinking lights which were seen; however
its flight path does not jibe with the radar data received and the estimate of speed
attributed to the unknown objects.
