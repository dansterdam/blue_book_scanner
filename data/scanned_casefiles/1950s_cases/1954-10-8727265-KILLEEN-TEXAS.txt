11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Oval shaped obj, silver glow without distinctive features, 
no sound, trail, or exhaust. Flight 2 vertical disappearing 
low on horizon in Southwest. Sighted innumerable times 
from 1 Oct - 20 Nov, when this report was made. Multiple 
military observers.

COMMENTS:
Sighting is descriptive of the refraction of a star or 
planet as it sets. Repeated observations and the same 
direction (coincident with the ecliptic) further sub-
stantiate this conclusion. Case evaluated as the re-
fraction of a star/planet as it sets.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[Most of the body text is too faint/blurry to be reliably OCR'd. The document header is clear, but the details and narrative text are not legible.]

The document appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report from the 1950s, with a location of Killeen, Texas, but the specific details cannot be read with confidence due to the poor image quality.

There are signatures at the bottom of the document, but they are also not clearly legible.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The document appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report form. Most of the text is faded and difficult to read, but the header is clearly visible. The document contains multiple numbered sections and several names or titles are partially visible in the left column, though they are not fully legible. The document seems to be an official military or intelligence form from the 1950s.

Some partially legible text includes:
(1) Location of occurrence
(2) Date/time of observation
(3) Date of report

Some names that are partially visible include:
Col. Kenneth Briggs
Capt. Richard Moore
(and several other partially legible names)

The bottom of the document contains additional numbered sections, but the text is too faded to read with certainty.

By virtue of their position, the reliability of the sighters must be beyond 
question. It is therefore believed that they are sighting an object which is 
foreign to them, and subject sightings are not the result of activated imag-
ination.
