STATEMENT

At approximately 2240 hours, on 21 July 1952, I was returning from observing the southern sky when I observed a bright light moving south at a speed of approximately 10 miles per hour. Suddenly, a solid white circle of light appeared, maintaining a straight course at approximately the same altitude as the one I had been observing. The light was about the size of a soft ball, and seemed to be pulsating. As the light got nearer, I could see a halo around it, but the light itself was so bright that I could not see through. The object was traveling smoothly at an indicated altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet as measured against a nearby peak. The light suddenly went off. I was then in a cloud bank, through which occasional glimpses of the object could be seen. The object was traveling in a straight, level course off either side. The light went off suddenly like it was shut off or went in a cloud bank, though for only very briefly. The contour was smooth (extremely or perfectly so). No jagged edges or tails were visible, or colors of other expressions were noticeable. I was this G. D. at the time.

STATEMENT

On 21 July 1952, at approximately 2240 hours, the writer and I were returning Lockhart to San Marcos via colored lights and objects. An object was sighted and approximately 5000 feet. It stopped and appeared white in color and I could identify the object as being round. The color seemed to change to very bright yellow and the object moved off to the south. It was quite fast.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2240 hours, 21 July 1952, I was leaving the barracks in my squadron when I looked up into the sky and saw a brilliant light which made an abrupt stopover about 500 yards from me and then the light disappeared.

STATEMENT

While walking from Air Police Squadron about 2240 hours, I noticed a light moving directly above it. It looked somewhat like a falling star. It was moving too fast to tell the size. It was in the air only 7 to 10 seconds.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2245 hours, 21 July 1952, an I was working my rounds on the base airfield at San Marcos AFB, Texas. There appeared to be traveling very slow, far away you could hear a low roaring noise but besides this there seemed to be nothing. The object at first didn't bother me as it was not too much because I just thought it was an airplane. Then it gained my attention and I was able to say that it was not an airplane but it was something. It was traveling very slow, about 75 miles or less, and I could see it clearly. It is difficult to estimate how big it was but I should say it was at least 75 feet in diameter. I would estimate it's altitude to be approximately 4000 feet. We had both seen it and a couple other guys that were standing around laughing at this thing.

3. Object observed without the aid of optical or electronic instruments.  
Object was observed in azimuth at 097° 43' North and 097° 43' West. Object passed from observation on a southerly bearing.  

4. Statements made by observers are self-explanatory. 

5. Estimations of size, distance, temperature, and location: ILLEGIBLE  
Excellent clarity of observation.  

6. There was no known air traffic in the general area at the time of the sighting.
