STATEMENT

At approximately 2240 hours, on 21 July 1952, I was returning from checking the Base Nursery. I was driving south at a speed of approximately 10 miles per hour. Suddenly a solid white circle of light appeared in front of me, initially in shape and color of a full moon but far more brilliant like looking at a white hot iron through a small hole. The object was not too high above the horizon, maybe 1000 feet. It rose at an extremely high rate of speed at an angle of 60-75 degrees at maybe 15,000, 20,000 feet it leveled off smoothly like an aircraft under good control would level off after a very rapid climb. The light went off suddenly like a flash cut off and went in a cloud bank, though no clouds were visible. The contour was smooth (extremely or perfectly so). No jagged edges or tails, smoke, or other colors were noticeable. I was Base O. D. at the time.

STATEMENT

On 21 July 1952, at approximately 2210 hours, the wife and I were returning from Lockhart to San Marcos and at Merrell, Texas, we noticed an object. It looked like something had exploded and it gave off a red flame and started to descend with a following blue flame which was very bright and appeared like a flare. It descended to about a estimate of 5000 feet. It stopped and appeared white in color and I could identify the object as being round. The color seemed to change to very light yellow and the object moved off to the south. It was quite fast.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2240 hours, 21 July 1952, I was leaving the guncroom in my squadron area when I looked up into the sky and saw a bluish-green object make an arch in the sky. The light from the trail was a bluish-green for a second or two and then the light disappeared.

At approximately 2240 hours while going to Air Police Headquarters, I observed a bluish green light in the sky. It ascended and descended very rapidly and then disappeared. There was no noise whatsoever.

STATEMENT

While walking from Air Police Squadron about 2240 hours, I noticed a blue green light falling at a great speed. It looked somewhat like a falling star. It was moving too fast to tell the size. It was in the air only 7 to 10 seconds.

STATEMENTS

At approximately 2245 hours, 21 July 1952, as I was making my rounds as the fence guard I noticed a reddish-yellow object in the sky. It seemed to be traveling very slow. Far away on old lake a low roaring noise can be heard. This object seemed over the base and I heard absolutely nothing. The object at first didn't bother me too much because I just thought it was an airplane. When it kept coming over the base (approximately 4 miles) then I realized my attention. As near as I could tell this object was traveling at the rate of 75 miles per hour. In other words it was going slow enough so that if it were used for some port of operation, it could reveal some strategic point in the base. Towards the end it simply disappeared in the sky. A couple fellows and I talked about what we had both seen and a couple other guys that were standing around laughing as if it were a joke. Things of that type are no joke.

S/Sgt Samuel R. Lewis, AF37606090, Asst Tech Inspector, Wing Inspectors Office, 21 July 1952. He and his wife were returning from Lockhart to San Marcos, at approximately 2240 hours CST, when they observed an object which appeared to have exploded and it gave off a red flame and started to descend with a following blue flame. The object was very bright and appeared to be a fast moving object, estimated 5000 feet. It stopped and appeared white in color and he could identify the object as being round. The object was a light yellow and the object moved off to the south. It was traveling quite fast.

S/Sgt Thedford R. Townsend, AF3560L157, Air Policeman, Air Police Squadron, stated that at approximately 2240 hours CST, 21 July 1952, he was leaving the guard area in his quarters area when he looked up into the sky and saw an object move as an arc in the sky. The light from the trail was a bluish-green for a second or two and then the light disappeared.

A/1C David McKenzie, AF19306627, Air Policeman, Air Police Squadron, stated that at approximately 2240 hours CST, 21 July 1952, he was going to Air Police Headquarters and observed a bluish-green light in the sky. It ascended and descended very rapidly and then disappeared. There was no noise whatsoever.

A/2C Frank R. Norred, AF14390366, Air Policeman, Air Police Squadron, stated that at approximately 2240 hours CST, 21 July 1952, he noticed a bluish-green light falling at a great speed. It looked somewhat like a falling star. It was moving too fast to tell the size. It was in the sky 7 to 10 seconds.

A/3C Paul W. Nelson Jr., AF13432918, Air Policeman, Air Police Squadron, stated that at approximately 2245 hours CST, 21 July 1952, he was making his rounds as the tower guard and noticed a reddish-yellow object in the sky. It passed overhead so low wearing noise but as this object passed overhead he could hear nothing. The object at first did not bother his too much because in his thought at the time it appeared like a low flying aircraft. When it began moving over the base (approximately four times) it gained his attention. Off hand he would say that this object was traveling at the rate of 75 miles per hour. In other words it was going slow enough so that if it were used for some sort of operation, it could reveal its strategic points on the base. Afterwards it just disappeared in the sky. A couple fellows and he talked about what they had seen and a couple others gave their opinion as if it was a joke. Things of that type are no joke.
