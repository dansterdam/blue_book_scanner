S T A T E M E N T

I observed three unidentified flying objects at 1:30 P.M. 19 October 1952, Central Standard Time, from the porch of my residence, San Antonio, Texas.

I had been sitting on the porch smoking for approximately twenty-five minutes before this incident occurred. As I sat there, I noticed a four-engined aircraft circle the Municipal Airport once then come in rather high for an approach landing. The plane cut its engines and commenced backfiring, drawing my attention closer to the aircraft.

At this time I noticed three circular objects in the North sky heading due South. One object was at a noticeably lower altitude than the other two; at any rate it was more than twice as large as the other objects. I would estimate the lower object to be approximately fifteen thousand feet and the other two at approximately twenty thousand feet altitude. The objects were flying a "V" formation. The lower object gave me the impression of flipping over slowly as it traveled through the air. This flipping movement exposed first an aluminum-like surface on one side then an Olive Drab one on the other. The other objects did not flip and appeared to be of aluminum construction.

I would estimate the speed of the objects to be approximately two hundred fifty miles per hour. The objects kept approaching until almost directly overhead; then the lower object stopped. I concentrated my attention on the lower object and lost sight of the other two. After the lower object stopped, it hovered a very short time, then commenced to get smaller and smaller very rapidly until it disappeared. I do not
