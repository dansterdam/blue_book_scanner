MEMO ROUTING SLIP

TO: Captain Hardin
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: ATIC: AFOIN-HE4

REMARKS:
COC Weather at ADC was contacted with respect to this report. The undersigned was informed that there was a possible temperature inversion at the time and place of the sighting. This, in connection with data contained in the report leads this headquarters to the opinion that the sighting could have been generated by the inversion, or possible inversion. The UFOB Index Card will not be initiated on this report. This report is forwarded due to the better facilities at your organization for analysis.

The information is not correct to definitely tie this object to seen as ground footage although this appears to be the most logical explanation. If additional information regarding the terrain features around the station could be obtained (including objects which could give a good reflected signal such as large buildings, grain elevators, steel power transmission lines, etc) it might be possible to more definitely establish the source of the reflections.

There is a handwritten notation "9/23/55" at the top right of the document.

A small curved or crescent-shaped sketch/mark appears on the right side of the document.

6. The recurrence of targets ranged from ~0 to 110 nautical miles.
There was no AF in evidence on the East side of the scope.

7. Even though the original target was picking up with the antenna on two
degrees, it did not change the intensity or the frequency of recurrence when it
was lowered to .5 degrees.

8. Though the target painted extremely bright before and immediately after
DK 17 was in the area, it painted only very dimly while he was flying in the general
vicinity.

9. The target was never seen to move, but after fading would always re-
appear in another location.

10. It never took another form than that of an aircraft target (in other
words, it never looked like AF or weather).

11. Even though we picked the track up at 236 nm coming toward us, we had
to overlay it to "Maggy" for a track number, and though it was "troubleside" to them,
they were unable to pick it up.

The above statement made by 1st Lt JOHN N. OLIVER, USAF, Director on Duty.

31. USE THIS SHEET FOR ANY COMMENTS, OPINIONS OR ADDITIONAL DATA NOT COVERED BY THE QUESTIONS.

at approx. 4/26/52, 26 Aug to 1955, A/20 Bosson motored a ship.
at 0750, 231 km. Beausus he tried to see what the track would do. With A/20 Young progressed to 0750, 220nm before an IP was established at 0159%. Before another
move could be put on the board, Airman Bosson was relieved by A/20 Young. Bosson
told Young to watch that particular track as it seemed to be coming pretty fast.
Airman Young called in a first move at 0222% with 0750 - 180nm. All plots were
called in as follows:

Initial Pick-up                      0770 - 236nm
IP      BH                           0750 - 220nm
1st     AH 5530                      0262Z    0750 - 180nm
2nd     AH 1020                      0206Z    0750 - 145nm
3rd     QF 4022                      0208Z    0750 - 120nm
4th     QF 1220                      0210Z    0750 - 103nm
5th     QH 0020                      0212Z    0300 - 90nm
6th     PH 4018                      0215Z    0330 - 74nm

Airman Young stated that the track began to slow down perceptibly at about
100nm. When it first faded at 90 nm he tried upper beam but without success. The
track reappeared and finally faded at PH 4018 (0330 - 74nm). However, a target
would reappear and paint strongly at that point but would not move, and then in a
few sweeps would fade completely. After about two reappearances, I called "Diploma
Controller, Capt Moore, and told him about it. He said if it reappeared again he
would scramble "Dropkick". The target did reappear and "Dropkick" 17 was scrambled
and was airborne at 0239Z. When he was about 5 miles from the spot the target was
last seen, it popped up dead ahead about 20 miles away, painting strongly. as the
other approached the target it began to fade and the last paint was when DK 17
was about 7 mile away. DK 17 did not get a visual nor was he able to make any
contact on his weapon. From then on it was like a game, the target would pop up
about 20 miles away and as soon as I had the fighter headed toward it, it would
fade. This happened 10 or 15 times until DK 17 reported he was low on fuel.

When he was about fifty miles from the area on his way back to base, the TFCB
began painting like a 5-52 but still was not moving.

There were several things quite odd about this incident:

1. A check of the Recorder's Logs show a definite reduction in speed from
better than 1000 miles per hour between 0252 and 0207% to 320 mph from 0212Z to
0315Z. Over this entire period he averaged 575 mph.

2. A constant check of the Height-finder never gave a height indication.

3. A constant check of upper beam both by A/20 Young and by myself never
revealed a track going through our area, yet when it faded, it had some almost
straight in.

4. This track faded about the same place that the track Lt Terry observed
was picked up going out.

5. "Dropkick" 17 could observe no lights above or below him though it
occurred in a relatively isolated area where there are only a few very small towns.
He was at 0.5, 10 and 15 thousand feet and never once had a weapon contact or a
visual observation. He reported that the weather was absolutely clear.
