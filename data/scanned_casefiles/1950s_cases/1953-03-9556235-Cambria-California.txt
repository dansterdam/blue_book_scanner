AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States DATE: 7 March 1953

LOCATION: Cambria, California DATE OF OBSERVATION: 9 March 1953

PREPARED BY: G2, HEADQUARTERS, 775th AC&W SQ, MARCH AFB, CALIF. DATE OF REPORT: 17 March 1953

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: An unidentified bright, disc-shaped object was observed in the sky over Cambria, California on 9 March 1953 between 2100 and 2135 PST. The object was described as being silver in color and traveling at a high rate of speed over the horizon. It appeared to be approximately 25-50 feet in diameter. The object was observed by several persons who were on the horizon when first sighted. The object was described as spherical in shape, with no visible means of propulsion. It appeared to be traveling in a horizontal direction and changing to a zig-zag pattern as it moved away. The speed of the unidentified object was described only as "excessive". No contrails or visible means of propulsion were observed.

On two subsequent nights, 10 and 11 March 1953, an extremely bright planet was visible in the direction from which the unidentified object had appeared to come. It was not determined whether this planet was the same object observed on 9 March 1953.

and the Northern Astronomers, the Observers viewed it very high in the sky. This sighting indicates there was an unidentified flying object in the local vicinity. This would probably account for the apparent strange color and distortion of this object from local usual flight patterns. It is possible that this can be identified as some military or experimental aircraft, but description from local witnesses indicate the object was silent, hovering, and changing color. The same object was observed from 1753 to about 1755 hour on 13 March 1953 by the witness Miss Hamilton AFS, Calif.

STATEMENT

On about 2200 hours, 2nd March 1953, an object, red in color, appeared in the sky over Cambria, California. This object was about the size of a man's hand held at arm's length. It was reported to the Air Defense Filter Center by a Deputy Sheriff from the Cambria area. No other witnesses were available at this time. The object moved very slowly and disappeared from sight after about 15 seconds. The object moved in a very peculiar manner, however, it was not that of a shooting star or meteorite. According to the report, the object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and was a definite red color. It traveled slowly towards the north and upwards.

STATEMENT
At approximately 2120 hours on the 3rd of March, 1953 I received a call. This was a call from Sgt. T/Sgt Brungess, who was on duty at the USAF radar station. He advised me to come out and take a look so I did. I stopped outside and looked in the direction I was told. I saw an object which seemed to be about 3000 to 4000 yards away and was proceeding in a zigzag course at a tremendous rate of speed - much faster than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. It would make a sharp turn, stop momentarily and then move off in another direction. This continued for approximately 15 minutes and I noticed that each time it stopped, a faint trail of smoke or steam appeared to be emitted from it. After about 15 minutes, the object turned and headed away at a terrific speed and was gone in approximately 3-4 seconds. I have never seen anything move so fast. I called the radar station, and Lt. Del Linski, Aft 64C0170, who was on duty, stated that they had the object on radar and that it did not give any return on their equipment. It was just disappearing from their scope like turning a light off. I have no other information concerning this incident.
