STATEMENT

At 2120 hours, 2 March 1953, T/Sgt Dranga came up to the transmitter door and summoned me outside. On going out he told me to come off the outside light. He then pointed out over the ocean. There was a round object which was of a reddish orange glow. Then I first saw the object, it looked about the size of a dime. It kept getting smaller. It was moving in a direction of NW. The distance and height was hard to judge because it was so dim. It was getting smaller, it ruled out the fact of being a star, almost impossible. It moved from side to side sort of a zig-zag. It seemed to hover for an instant and then vanished from view.

STATEMENT

March 2nd at 2120 I went outside the door of the Operations building and observed a reddish orange object suspended in the sky. It seemed to be about on a level with where I was standing thus it might have had an altitude of approximately 1000 feet. Distance is deceptive at night so I hard to estimate how far it was away. I could judge that it was nearly out to the horizon. It had a slight sideways motion and also it seemed to hover at a certain distance from land over the ocean. It disappeared in a couple of seconds. The size when it was hovering over the ocean seemed to be a little bit bigger than that of a 25c piece.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report (Short Title: FLYOBSRPT)

LOCATION: Cambria, California (Hq 775th ACAW Sq, Hamilton AFB, Calif.)

DATE OF REPORT: 16 March 1953    DATE OF INFORMATION: 2 March 1953

PREPARED BY (Title): Capt. Orville B Mixel, Dir of Intelligence

DISTRIBUTION: AFOIN-X2C, dated 29 April 1952, Hq 775th ACAW Sq Msg 75 GAC 172

SUMMARY:

In accordance with AFL 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBSRPT)" the following report of an unidentified flying object is submitted.

On 2 March 1953, between 2100 and 2125 PST, four airmen of the 775th ACAW Squadron, Cambria, California observed an unidentified airborne object, over the ocean to the West of the 775th ACAW Squadron, with an apparent 30 degree heading in a WNW direction. The object appeared to be about 30 degrees above the horizon when first sighted. The object was described as spherical in shape, ranging from approximately twelve inches to about one inch in diameter and dropping to a horizontal position on the horizon. The observers stated that the object appeared to move short distances in a WNW direction and intermittently hovered in one place. The object appeared to be red when first observed, changing to a middle-orange as it appeared to move further away.

The only sound was described only as "excessive". The sounds were heard coming from the object. No contrails or visible means of propulsion were observed.

On two subsequent nights following the sighting of this unidentified flying object, an extremely bright planet was visible in a WNW direction from the 775th ACAW Squadron. At 2000 PST the planet appeared to be approximately forty degrees above the horizon and disappeared below the horizon at about 2135 PST. As the planet progressed toward the horizon, the size appeared to diminish causing its color to change from a bluish-white to a red-orange.

As the angle between the planet and the horizon decreased, the observer viewed the strong an incandescent glow from a local brush fires. This would probably account for the apparent changes in size, color, and movement of the planet. It is possible that the unidentified flying object observed by the four airmen on 2 March 1953 was the same planet observed from the 775th ACAW Squadron on the nights of 3 and 4 March 1953.

and the horizon decreased, the observers viewed it through an increasing amount of haze and smoke from local brush fires. This
would normally account for the apparent changes noted in size, color, and
movement of this plane. It is possible that the unidentified flying object observed by the four airmen on 2 March 1953 was the same
plane observed from the 775th Road Squadron on the 6th subsequent
nights.

STATEMENT

It is about 2100 hours 2nd March 1953, an object, red in color appearing to be about one (1) foot in diameter, was seen. This object was first then about 215 feet outside it approximately 215 feet the object moved off in a northwesterly direction at a successive rate of speed so as to appear the size of a baseball in a very few seconds. The object moved in a very familiar manner, to it seemed like a light suspended from a balloon, somewhat like a swaying motion.

The object gave a long dip as it moved out to sea. At about 2120 I called A/2C Hare and also A/2C Delmar and they also saw the object which was then far out to sea and slowly moving. The altitude was first about 1000 feet but after more careful study it could have been much higher at 15 to 16 degrees above the horizon when first sighted.

At approximately 2120 hours on the 2nd of March 1953 I received a telephone call from M/Sgt Brunges, who was on duty at the MARS station, asking me to step outside the door and look at the sky out over the ocean and tell him what I saw. I stepped outside and looked in the described direction and saw an object which appeared to be a ball of fire. It appeared to be about eight (8) inches in diameter and was proceeding in a westerly direction. I could not judge the speed. For approximately one (1) foot I stopped. It seemed to drop and rise three times without getting smaller. It then moved again in the same direction as mentioned above with an appeared again to be several feet. It then stopped and dropped again and stayed out of sight for approximately five (5) seconds, then reappeared and disappearing again. The last time I was the object, it appeared to be about one (1) inches in diameter. The time that I had lapsed from the first time I saw it until it disappeared was about ten (10) minutes.

The above took place while I was on duty with the Air Police stationed at Post number 4.
