In the narrative section:

In May 1952, a report was received from the Air Attache, Brazil on an official sighting of a "flying canoe" near Rio de Janeiro. Two photographers of the newspaper O Cruzeiro had five photographic negatives allegedly taken of the canoe. The incident was at Barra da Tijuca, at 1920Z hours on 7 May 1952. It will be noted that this beach lies locally in a line between Rio and Sao Paulo. The newspaper asked 625,000 for world-wide publication.

The negatives were examined by Lip photo experts, another outstanding US photo lab, and by this headquarters, a second evaluation was recommended. Accordingly, at Sao Paulo, it was an attempt at a colossal hoax. This was based primarily on the facts that:

(1) the shadow on the "saucer" in one photograph did not match those of the terrain and
(2) the making price was 6100, then to 3000 (photographic attempt of source instead),
after no customers were found for the original offer.

These events lead to a preliminary evaluation of the attached report as follows:

(1) If Mr. [name illegible] reported this information prior to 7 May 52 (it is impossible to determine the date from the report), it is possible that he was not of the scheme.

[Rest of the document contains mostly blank or illegible sections with checkboxes and classification markings]

EVALUATION SHEET (Contd)

(2) If the information was not reported until late May 52 (to be
precise), it is probable that Mr. Burtoncoulis was merely taking
two provided the necessary impetus for proclaiming his theory or is
merely taking advantage of the wide publicity given the incident,
Also, he could have been an employee in a newspaper office, but the
almost sole disseminator. In either case, his source of legality appears to be
more than just coincidental.

Additional information on Mr. [redacted] and his activities, past and future,
is desired since it may be useful in future analysis of unidentified flying
objects. ( Captain Fournet, Jan 3299, ATIC-26)

U.S. Naval Attaché, Rome, Italy                Date: 10 May 1952                    Serial No.: 20-52

Subject: Scheduled Invasion of Brazil

Ref: (a) Holy Bible, Book of Revelations, Chapter 9
Encl: (1) Forecast of Arrival of Martians*

Enclosure (1) is forwarded for such action as the Director of Naval Intelligence may deem suitable. In view of the public reaction to Orson Welles' radio broadcast concerning the invasion of the Martians, it was thought inadvisable to warn the Brazilian Ambassador in Rome of the scheduled invasion. No doubt the Office of Naval Research and the Naval Observatory will be notified at having a simple Italian citizen explain such a controversial subject.

Mr. [redacted] will be requested to furnish this office with any further information concerning this subject that he may be able to obtain.

REVELATIONS ON THE PLANET MARS

1. The atmosphere of Mars, near its surface, corresponds to that of our
Earth, which therefore consists the growth of vegetable and animal life.

2. Altogether, the climate is divided into two yearly seasons and the
environmental temperature, near its surface, corresponds to that of the Earth.

3. The canals which were discovered in 1882 by Schiaparelli, are actual
canals, intercepted by great seas, built by intelligent beings - by the Martians.

4. Mars is therefore inhabited, and by creatures who are more intelligent
than we are.

5. They see us and are anxious to get into contact with us. Their physical
build is 114 cm, however, they are stronger and taller than we are - six feet
as an average. Altogether the planetary system of Mars is similar to that of
the Earth.

REVELATIONS ON THE FLYING SAUCERS

1. The flying saucers which have been seen in the last five years, are
nothing but huge and powerful machines, that the Martians launch on the Earth,
in order to reveal themselves and to explore the Earth's surface, with the purpose
of studying whether it is possible to land there.

2. I therefore exclude the possibility of these flying saucers being secret
weapons being experimented by States of this world, as it is well known that in
no country exists secret or power such as to give such an extraordinary proof
to so enormous and powerful devices.

3. The flying saucers are piloted by the Martians, who would like to, and
could, land; but they are deterred from this attempt by the terror of being com-
pelled to remain here for the rest of their life, as on the earth there are no
flying fields equipped in such a way as to allow them to take off again.

4. I therefore consider improbable the hypothesis that such machines may
be radio-commanded, also because in all cases then the flying saucers have been
seen, they have shown such an extraordinary skill and precision of maneuvering
which is possible only if an intelligent being is present within the machine.

5. The future development of the Martians' skill - particularly owing to
the explorations effected on the earth - will allow them at some future time (which
for the present I cannot yet foresee) to land on the earth, carrying all the
engines and devices necessary and sufficient to enable them to return to Mars.

6. The landing will be preceded by scouting areas of flying saucers whose
formations will take place more or less periodically. The first of these formations
of flying saucers - after the date on which this document has been presented -
will be seen with mathematical certainty about the end of the month of June next
in the locality known by the name of Baixa del Espirito da Prata del San Jose.

Therefore, I beg the competent American Military Authorities and particularly of the "Pentagon" to ask their correspondents or Military Attaches of the district, or the authorities of Brasilian to have the sky carefully inspected at the time and in the above-said region, providing for a special observation service by means of telescopes and aircraft to take place.

If what I have said is taken - or not - into consideration, I shall greatly appreciate being notified with all possible urgency, to my address. As I am in a position to determine - about the 20th of June next - the day, and to restrict the zone in which the observation is to take place, I could inform directly the Brasilian Embassy.

Once the results of the said observations are known, please give me confirmation of these, as if you are interested, I shall be able to furnish further and more personal information.

For the present I prefer to keep the source of this information secret, and that till the date when the first formation will take place.

The Isle of Lovers Hoax

Some photographic hoaxes are more cleverly executed. In May 1952, a few weeks after Life magazine had alarmed the world with its article "Have We Visitors from Outer Space?" [15], the Brazilian weekly picture magazine O Cruzeiro published startlingly clear photographs of an alleged flying saucer [16]. According to the accompanying story, a reporter and a photographer on the staff of the magazine on May 7 had visited Ilha dos Amores, an island not far from Rio de Janeiro, to do a feature assignment. Late in the .

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 78-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

afternoon, at a moment when the photographer just happened to have his camera pointed at the sky, the reporter suddenly called his attention to a passing UFO. During the minute or so the object was in view he obtained five pictures which, along with the reporter's eyewitness story, were released to the public on May 17. If the editors actually believed in the reality of the saucer, the ten-day delay before informing the world of its visit is remarkable. The magazine has never admitted that the photographs were a hoax, but they inspired doubt even in sympathetic investigators [17].

The UFO appears in a dull sky above a mountain peak. In the first picture the object looks like a jet plane surrounded by an exhaust haze and, with a little imagination, might be called a "Saturn-like" object. In succeeding pictures it resembles the top of a teapot, or the bottom view of a rubber stopper for a sink. A study of the shadows quickly reveals the fraudulent nature of these photographs: the dome on top of the "saucer" casts its shadow to the right, while the trees and mountains in the foreground cast their shadows to the left. The picture could be authentic only in a peculiar world in which the sun shone from the west on objects on the ground, but shone from the east on objects flying in the sky!

APPENDIX II
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - 7 May 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

On 7 May 1952 two photographers of "O Cruzeiro" Magazine in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, reported that they had photographed a "flying disc" at a position 23° 01' S, 43° 25' W. The object reportedly was in view one minute before being taken.

It approached from the southeast, made a 120° turn and went out of sight toward the sea. It was described as having a high speed, blue-gray color and it seemed to be over 1000 meters in altitude about twice the size of a DC-3.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION:

The photographers reportedly were asking $10,000 for the five negatives, consequently, the negatives are not available for study.

III. CONCLUSIONS:

Until the negatives are analyzed, it is impossible to draw any definite conclusions. It is doubtful that the pictures and story are authentic.

E RAM quatro horas da tarde do dia 7 de maio, quarta-feira. Tínhamos sido, depois de meio-dia, ao local denominado Ilha dos
Amores na Barra da Tijuca. A nossa atenção era das mais possantes
Prefeitura para uma reportagem sobre os mais diversos atos,
nos dias de semana, procuram mapear jaraguás um refúgio para os
seus estudos. Seria um trabalho interessante, pitoresco, humano, algo
muito prático. E tão nosso era o fato, como dizemos "estalar o ambiente". Procurávamos passar como turistas despercebidos, e tínhamos de assegurar a nossa "cara". O tempo, nas altas altitudes, ainda
sido tudo choroso. Mas apesar de amanhecerindo, início, então de sol.
Chegamos mais em meio a uma hora da tarde. Atravessamos o
pequeno lagarinho no laranjal "Palha" e nos dirigimos para o "bar do
Congado", a fim de tomarmos água. Quase ninguém apareceu. Passamos conversa
com dois portugueses, um dos quais, com o dedo do bar, António Teixeira, arregaçando-lhe camisa com o dedo do bar. Andando Teixeira, arregaçando-lhe camisa com o dedo do bar. Andando Teixeira, desconfiado do que
desejávamos realizar. Por sobre as nossas cabeças, ouvimos, mais ao
mesmo tempo cinco ou cinco minutos, o ruído de um motor, por trás de
todos os aviões das linhas Rio - São Paulo e aeroportos do Sul.
Enquanto saboreávamos um prazo de caminhada, espalhila da Força Aérea
vezes para apreciar as arredondas que um espalhila da Força Aérea
Brasileira estava fazendo nas imediações, por volta das duas horas. Se
as coisas tão naturalmente, estávamos praticamente com a viagem perfeitamente encaminhada. Como não tínhamos outro jeito, e mesmo porque uma das vítimas era a paciência, deixamos levar por aí.
E aconteceu o que menos poderíamos imaginar: entre quatro e
quatro e meia, adivinhamos súbitas as ações, justamente no centro
do qual interior, quando, olhando por acaso para o mar, tivemos a
admiração de ver um objeto que se movia no ar, ao lado do Sul.
Esse objeto, a distância, assemelhava-se com um avião, visto de frente,
mas o extraordinário era que esse "avião", que parecia voltar para
uma velocidade de lado, numa velocidade tremenda. Vinha diretamente
do oceano para a terra, perpendicularmente a rota dos aviões comerciais.
- Olha, Kettel, que coisa é aquilo?
- Qualquer coisa para isso levar. Provavelmente, dado importante
ao fato. Mas não somos dois repórteres, com a atenção sempre alerta
por uma questão de trinta profissional. O estranho objeto na altura
a linha de terra, parecia diminuir de velocidade. A essa altura já
apresentava mais clara, depois de perder diante do Sol. Kettel estava
com a máquina, uma Rolleiflex, pronta para pegar. Motivo por
um impulso, uma ainda vaga suspeita, quase gritei:
- Bate, Kettel!
Le baixa a primeira chapa. Depois nos confessou que o Kettel tinha
isso por brincadeira. Mas o "avião" se aproximava numa outra trajetória mais ousada. Agora era diferente: já havia
mais visão de manobra de aeronave. Com grande precisão se aproxima
Kettel pela rapidíssima e velocidade da operação. Em 1/50 (cinco segundos de exposição) e outros 1/50 de disco (parando o movimento). Enquanto isso, o disco (porque já era disco) se aproximava cada vez mais, numa trajetória de Tijuca até ...

At the bottom of the page, there is a caption that reads:
A PRIMEIRA VISÃO. Tinha a silhueta de um avião, visto de frente, mas clara se movendo para o lado, isto foi o que chamou a atenção dos dois repórteres de O CRUZEIRO.

Report on Flying Saucer Near Rio de Janeiro

About noon, on May 7, 1952, [redacted] was on board a [redacted] with his crew, Brazilian Journal "El Cruzeiro", set out on a trip to the island of [redacted]. They soon noticed something unusual in the sky. For about 15 minutes they observed an object which suddenly turned and moved in a direct line with the Brazilian passenger coaches. They were making a round trip of Air France planes at through their maneuvers. Neither out crew nor the crew of what seemed to be the Cruzeiro plane of a plane could explain the phenomenon.

At about 12:10 P.M., starting to write at a tremendous speed, the object approached the plane ending at that time, and the object descended almost perpendicularly, giving the impression of a metallic object. It was headed directly toward shore, and having oscillating, dark in color.

Since no reporters were always on the alert for unusual sights, they immediately noticed it. They could see it clearly. As the object approached their position, it seemed to glow with a glow, and this allowed the detection of the velocity of the item. It was then that it looked more like a metallic object. They could see it flying at a speed of about 750 miles per hour, which undoubtedly was actual. Its speed was such that it passed the area of Tijuca before flying over the patch to Gavea.

The close observation lasted about 3 minutes. The close approach of the flying object caused a shock distance with the agency. Then they closed another angle, flying a short distance over the agency. The close returned toward the plane, flying at about 15 degrees and at about 15 miles from the ground. After this cancelling maneuver, they observed the object flying over the city, and it did not have any sound nor observe any rays. It is possible that no sound was at a frequency too high to be heard by the human ear. At which the object flew and its next shape appeared to be something more than a thousand meters above the ground and seemed to be of a DC-3 plane, although they could not confirm these details.

The only thing they could say is that they saw the object as described, under the conditions established. Finding the photographs, which of the case, later took the remaining four photographs. Then they looked for another place, took photographs. Waited a time, a kilometer was explaining his not at that time. His own was not.

We immediately returned to the hotel, the small village, and personal our effort is report our unusual experience. To give in that possible to the press, police and informed the press from his camera with the news of knowing an about back, and had no difficulty in the 20 or 25 miles. At the presence of the directory, he wave in the plane, and had no difficulty in the 20 or 25 miles. At the presence of the directory, he easily had been received on our plane. Had no difficulty in explaining a short, a balloon, or a meteor for the flying object. The final design of our story completely confirmed.

SEXTA E ÚLTIMA PARTE

Por JOÃO MARTINS

Nesta sera e ultima parte do seu trabalho, João Martins comenta as observações verificadas antes de 1947, analisa as diversas hipóteses existentes acerca dos movimentos dos "discos" em torno do nosso planeta e apresenta as suas conclusões a respeito, juntando num só todo os elementos já expostos nos capítulos anteriores. João Martins continua pesquisando até a solução final. Quem puder prestar alguma informação deve comunicá-la ao nosso repórter.

[Paragraph in right column]
NOS cinco capítulos anteriores desta série, forneci aos leitores todos os elementos necessários para que o mistério dos "discos voadores" fosse devidamente esquadrinhado. Apenas um aspecto do problema precisa ainda ser abordado e comentado, antes de entregarmos nas conclusões finais. Trata-se dos casos de observações de "discos" anteriores ao ano de 1947. Naquela época, o piloto Kenneth Arnold fazer a sua comunicação, que passou a ser histórica por ter sido a primeira a chegar ao conhecimento do grande público, outras observações já haviam sido feitas e levadas ao conhecimento das autoridades. A mais significativa foi a de um meteorologista, de Richmond (Virginia), que em abril daquele ano (dois meses antes do caso Arnold) seguiu a ascensão de um balão-sonda com o teodolito, quando avistou um objeto desconhecido voando a grande velocidade. O meteorologista, acompanhando-o com o seu instrumento e comparando a posição do mesmo com a do balão, calculou a altitude, a velocidade, o diâmetro real, e enviou um relatório à Força Aérea Americana.

Para alguns estudiosos, os "discos voadores" têm aparecido desde tempos remotos. Há mesmo quem interprete os reflexos de Ezequiel (um dos quatro grandes profetas do Velho Testamento) sobre aparecimento de "rodas" no céu, como casos de "discos"; cerca de seis séculos antes de Cristo. No século 19, vários relatos policiais de jornais da época são também interpretados por muitos como observações de "discos". Entretanto, numa análise preliminar, cientificamente falando, não creio que essas observações antigas sejam de grande valor. Não há meios de verificar até que ponto elas foram reais, não podendo os mesmos critérios atuais ser aplicados a alucinações, sugestões de leituras, enganos com corpos celestes ou fenômenos luminosos. Creremos, assim, sem grande risco de cairmos no terreno da fantasia ou especulação pura, se nos afastarmos de conclusões de dados cuja veracidade não nos é possível comprovar. Não há dúvida que alguns dos relatos do século passado do início do

"DISCOS VOADORES"

do século XX são minuciosos e realmente enigmáticos. Eles provêem de todas as partes do mundo, desde o Tibete aos Estados Unidos, desde a Nova Zelândia à Inglaterra, desde a Sibéria às Ilhas Galápagos. Como, porém, determinar a validade das narrativas dos fatos, ou precisar a natureza desses fatos? Uma coisa é certa: eles eram raros, segundo o que revelam as escassas pesquisas levadas a efeito nas publicações de todos os gêneros do passado. Temos pois que nos ater aos casos recentes, mesmo assim após um grande trabalho de filtragem dos que estão devidamente comprovados, conforme fizeram no decorrer desta série. De outro modo, só nos restaria deixar a imaginação voar sem ser ferida ou entrar no campo do misticismo.

Embora nos fins da última Grande Guerra hajam surgido inúmeros relatos de aviadores (de ambos os lados) que contavam ter visto ou terem sido seguidos por "bolos luminosos" e "discos voadores", até hoje nada se conseguiu apurar de forma definitiva que justificasse o que hoje chamamos "discos voadores". Tanto aliados como nazistas tentaram invadir-se de armas secretas, mas as estranhas troças assinaladas foram batizadas com os nomes de "foo fighters", ou "capas fantasmas", ou "bolides Kraut". Apareciam indistintamente em formações de caráter vago, como os "nevoeiros dos bombardeios". Deram muito que pensar aos Estados-Maiores de ambos os lados. Com entanto, com o correr do tempo, não causaram nenhum dano, foram classificados como "neutros" ou "alucinações visuais" dos pilotos que as descreveram. E o assunto ficou arquivado nos anais do conflito. Seríam "discos voadores"? Quem pode afirmar?

Assim, caminhamos sobre um terreno mais firme, estudando e analisando os fatos investigados, comprovados, reais, acontecidos nestes últimos dez anos. De tudo o que foi exposto, vemos que os "objetos não identificados" têm apresentado formas e tamanhos diversos. De maneira geral, podemos agrupá-los em três categorias: 1 — tóra luminosa; 2 — objetos circulares; 3 — objetos alongados, cilíndricos.

O CRUZEIRO, 15 de novembro de 1957

Estavam eles normalmente há muito tempo adeptos dessa teoria aceitavam em relação aos relatos antigos, alguns cética na interpretação da existência de vida em outros planetas, algumas das teorias atômicas, que estariam ameaçando não só a nossa própria sobrevivência como também o equilíbrio interplanetário, pois uma catástrofe na Terra poderia ter efeitos desastrosos em todo o sistema solar. Assim, estavam eles aqui para nos alertar contra essa perigosa situação.

CONHECIMENTO, COM FINS DETERMINADOS

3 — Se há possibilidade ou desejo de um contacto pacifico futuro, não se explicam as quedas e desaparecimentos de aviões, os atos de aparente hostilidade, a existência na observação de aeroplanos, de bases e de zonas onde estão instalados centros atômicos.

4 — Se houvesse interesse somente em tornar-se uma medida drástica, no futuro o perigo das explosões atômicas se agravasse, sem julgamento de descida, não seria preciso um estudo tão acurado do problema.

Esta hipótese, isolada ou combinada com algum dos seus descobrimentos, teria de ser aceita como a melhor, caso não houvesse uma terceira. Infelizmente, essa terceira existe, e mais do que uma hipótese, os fatos a apontam como uma certeza uma certeza.

O QUE OS "DISCOS" ESTÃO FAZENDO NA TERRA.

Os leitores que acompanharam esta série desde o início estão de posse de todos os elementos básicos necessários para, julgando por si próprios nas hipóteses expostas acima, a conclusão a que estamos chegando. Lembramos que uma hipótese, para ser viável, deve necessariamente ser compatível com todos os fatos conhecidos. Deve ter um papel de ser armado com todas as peças existentes, mesmo que seu exame não corresponda aos nossos desejos. Esperamos que, deixando de lado algumas peças, a nosso arbítrio, poderíamos formar o quadro que mais nos agradasse. Mas não corresponderá à realidade; assim fazendo estaremos apenas tentando mistificar a nós próprios.

Antes de mais nada, vamos resumir o que nós não sabemos, o que ainda ficará sem solução, até que obtenhamos mais dados, neste momento.

1 — De que planetas eles vêm. Vários cientistas, entre os quais o Prof. Hermann Oberth, acham possível que eles venham até do nosso sistema solar (embora-se do que está no fim do quinto capítulo, a respeito da vida no Universo). De acordo com essas cientistas, desde que se domine uma ilimitada fonte de força (como a propulsão por campos magnéticos) a velocidade limite, nos espaços interplanetários, seria de 300.000 quilômetros por segundo. Isso para nós, atualmente, é apenas um sonho, como, há cinquenta anos, era um sonho a velocidade de 300 km/h. Aquelas velocidades, as viagens através do nosso sistema planetário seriam relativamente curtas. Entretanto, a jornada para essas regiões seriam longas; até Alfa do Centauro seriam precisos mais de quatro anos.

[The rest of the text is in Portuguese and appears to be a lengthy article. The text continues across multiple paragraphs, but due to the length, I cannot transcribe the entire document. The title translates to "The Silent Threat That Comes From" (with the last word cut off in the image).]

The text appears to discuss astronomical observations, scientific possibilities, and potential extraterrestrial life, with references to various astronomical bodies like Wolf 359, Sirius, and Kruger 60. The article seems to be speculative in nature, discussing the potential for life on other planets and the implications of such possibilities.

The text is dense and written in Portuguese, covering topics related to space, potential alien life, and scientific speculation about the universe.

At approximately 1700 local time 5 May 1952 this office received a call from Diario da Noite, local newspaper, stating that they had some photos, made of a "flying object". They would tell a representative of the Air Attache. The Acting Air Attache received a call later from a representative of that newspaper confirming the story. The photos of a "flying object" were shown down within enlargement to various sizes, together with the negatives, was shown. The unidentified object was an individual with the motorcycle or the boat. The photographs and his companion who was present when the pictures were taken, together with two observers this object was first seen at approximately 1630 local 12 N toward the southwest traveling in a northerly direction and descending. The location was in town near Praia da Tijuca, a sand beach at approximately 23° 01' South and 43° 26' West.

At first the photographer thought it was a DC-3, but immediately realized it was an unknown object. He took several pictures with a camera using a DC-3 travel. The object continued in a northerly direction for a short time, then started a large circle to the right, confirming nearly a 180° turn around the observers still slowly descending, finally heading approximately South and distant. It was about 100 meters or its speed. The observers estimated or its speed. They studied its shape to be as shown in the pictures (details later). They noticed no rotation or instability; there was no sound of any kind heard, nor was there any smoke, fire or evidence of exhaust or trails. They continued to verify, without any indication of the type of construction or material. They would give no explanation as to their reason for being in that location. There is no evidence of any other observers.

The prints and negatives were carefully examined by the Acting Air Attache. The camera was a Polaroid, such negative being 2¼ x 3¼. The five negatives did not appear to be retouched in any way. The possibility that they could have been faked by picture retouching or double exposure was not detectable to an observer. Particular attention was drawn to an object being thrown into the air by a companion also existing. The negatives of an object being thrown into the air by a companion also exist. The negatives were carefully examined by the Acting Air Attache and the lens settings were made with great haste (Such is reasonable).

The first picture was taken almost directly into the sun and shows the object in an oblong position, from this direction now described. From the first location it was obviously in the same object shown in the four subsequent photographs. The last four are only views of the object showing fairly clearly the shape of both top and bottom.

The object shown is a round disc, slightly concave on the bottom and convex on top. It has a round or oval outside backing, thin at the edge. On top and center is a low, round, flat-topped dome. The diameter is estimated to be about 8 to 10 meters. The number of this disc is a second disc or revolution of the disc forth. On top of this disc and centered on the top of the disc is a plain and smooth aspect for a raised circular rib - centered and approximately the same diameter as the top. A second round, circular rib is also noted.

The photos were successfully taken at 1/500 second and no distinction due to motion is visible. Nor is it possible to detect material or type of construction. All negatives were carefully examined.

The Acting Air Attaché was informed that copies of all five pictures would be furnished after publication.

CONTENTS of Reporting Officer:

It is felt that there is a strong possibility that the photos were faked and it is doubted that copies will be made available. The fact that the object was first seen looking almost directly into the sun seems unlikely. That there were no other observers and the photographer evidently did not look for others seems peculiar. There is no satisfactory supported reason for the photographer to have been at this particular place. Another source doubted Anil, Finally, $25,000 is being asked for the world-wide rights, which indicates that profit is more desired than verifying the identity of the object.

The following is a translation of the reporter's story published in "O Cruzeiro" on 13 May. This story varies slightly from that told the Acting Air Attaché on 13 May. The search for other observers was not indicated in the flight path description then did not include the variation in speed or the vertical position as indicated in this report.

"O CRUZEIRO"
17 May 1952
FLYING SAUCER ON SERRA DA TIJUCA

It was May 7th, Wednesday, four o'clock in the afternoon. We had originally arrived at 1:00 P.M. in the so-called "Isle of Love", in barra da Tijuca. The purpose of our visit was to take some pictures of beautiful couples. While taking an article about them. It was bound to be an interesting, picturesque, warm, slightly rustic scene. Anil Ribeiro was there, looking for an object like tourists so that we wouldn't scare our "game". The weather in the last few days had been truly and cold. But this Wednesday morning the sun was shining, and it turned out to be a beautiful day.

We arrived more or less at 1:00 P.M. We crossed the little lake on a row boat, called "Piabá" and upon landing we went straight to the "Bar do Compahia" in order to have something to eat. It did not seem to be a very lucky day for us. Nobody was around. We started a conversation with the Bar owner, Antonio Teixeira, and got some information that could be valuable for us, although he did not have any idea of what we were going to do. Every 5 minutes, more or less, we heard the noise of an airplane, passing over head. "It is a plane", we would say. "No, it is not a plane", Antonio would also say. Planes going or coming from the airports situated in the south region of Brazil.

While we were enjoying a delicious dish of shrimp, we got up and went to watch the daring maneuvers of a squadron of the Brazilian Air Force. This was around 2 P.M. If during do not know, we took, the Brazilian Air Force, like we did not have any other choice, and also because patience is one of the virtues of a good reporter, we decided to hang around to see if anything would happen.

And something did happen. Something that could never happen. Between four and four thirty we were sitting on the sand, exactly in the beginning of the interior channel. Glancing at the ocean, we saw an object moving in the air, on the side of the sun. At this distance, the object was small. In our airplane, some from Panair, but the extraordinary thing, about this "airplane" where front seemed to be facing us was that it was moving sideways. It was coming almost from the ocean in the direction of the earth, perpendicular to the route of the com-

[The rest of the text is as follows:]

(Partial text about aerial observation, with details about seeing an unusual object)

... I spoke to my colleague, looked, what is that? ... My other person probably would not pay attention to the fact, but we were more or less in matter of professional training, we are always on the alert. When the strange object was much clearer to the earth, it seemed to be a fantastic phenomenon. Kerfol had his camera hanging, I tried to take some pictures of what I saw. I almost shouted, "Look it."

[Continues with narrative about observing an unusual aerial object, describing its movement, shape, and trajectory]

All that lasted not more than a minute. We did not hear any sound. It seemed that the object was flying horizontally and very slowly. The witness compared to the hearing capacity of the human being. It did not have any sign of smoke or flame. It was not luminous. Its color was dark, which caused it to be confused with the sky. We took several pictures, well this was difficult to be detailed, however.

[Further description of the sighting continues]

What we can assure you, however, is that we really saw the object, under the conditions which have been described, while I was watching, the object (and I had glasses on), trying hard to keep in my memory everything I was witnessing, my colleague Kerfol took some photos. There was no time for taking more pictures because there had been more time, it would not have been possible to take more pictures because we had only one film. The two photos were taken in the office of "O Cruzeiro" on the same day we saw the saucer, and a picture of a couple taken when we arrived at the island, and finally, the picture on the bar counter at our own facilities when we were eating, one shining, later having been taken by the bar owner.

passing around that plane; however, this time he could not have seen because he was in
the house. A couple, having lunch in the porch, had not seen it as well. He also dislike
dislike for being witness to anything.

We went back to our printing office in a hurry. From Joe we phoned over direct
and told him what had happened. He said he was in the laboratory, was in the office
until we arrived (as it was past 5 o'clock). I drove my car as a normal through the
downtown streets. At the printing office we were the first to be present. In charge
of the laboratory service and the pictures started to be printed. And then the two
us, who were on the job, the supervisor of the service, began to be official yet
exhibition. What would be printed on the negative? Could we have been the victims of
an hallucination? Could we have confused an airplane, a cloud, an article with a
flying saucer? Well, looking at the negatives through photographic lens we would be
able to overcome this doubt. These were moments of great anxiety. Our colleagues
our chiefs were very surprised, with us. Disappeared Joao Martins, and recently
as well as José Augusto, Milton D'Avila, Ari Vasconcelos, the Laboratory personnel,
were all sharing our anxiety. And when at last the pictures were printed a general
question of the disc was also printed on it, there was a general expression of evidence.
Like the explanation, the pictures had confirmed our story, without doubt.

We had this great chance to witness and photograph this mysterious thing that
has been appearing in different parts of the earth and it's been the cause of so many
hypothetical and controversial discussions. We made this boat of this chance. And here are the
pictures to be examined by our readers, just as the Flying saucer was up over there
da Tijuca in that sunny afternoon. This reportage is a journalistic achievement which
is bound to have world repercussion. Never before has a Flying saucer been photographic
under these conditions, with so much detail as now. Is it from another planet? We
would like it be an object from another planet? We do not know. We can only affirm that
it exists. Could it be something to benefit mankind, or a threat to human life? Many
other questions could be made but they would not be answered as well before the
mystery remains.

Many Flying saucers have been seen in different countries and different occasions.
Their form varies, but the mystery remains. This is the mystery that sooner or
later we will have to unravel.

Note: Attention is called to the shadow cast by the dawn on the flag in the
last view (Ultima Vista). In this view the sun would have been nearly at the photographer's back.
