Science News Letter for February 23, 1957

Symbols for Stars in Order of Brightness

Praesepe or the Manger

In this group, on a dark clear night, one can see a faint misty light that has somewhat the appearance of a cluster or a corner. Actually this is a nakedness star cluster, a great aggregation of distant suns in the same age. It is sometimes called the Manger, and two dominant stars in the cluster, nearby, are supposed to be feeding from it.

Early in the 16th century, when he was making the first telescope, observations of Galileo looked at Praesepe and counted 40 stars, thus proving that there was a cluster which could not be seen by the naked eye.

Modern powerful telescopes reveal several hundred or more in this little group.

Dear Miss [redacted]

This replies to your letter in which you reported an unidentified observation you made approximately ten years ago.

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will give your letter-documentation passage. At this late date, it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that an individual report his observation as soon as possible. This enables Air Force analysis to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Your interest in the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects is appreciated. I have enclosed the 1967 report on our project.

Pilots tried to catch it but it out-maneuevered them in excess
of 200mph! It hovered occasionally, was about the size of a
plane, and traveled S. to N.! (Reports by Pilots increasing)


- page 8 -

March 8, 1957. Victor Hancock and Guy Miller, pilots for Tennessee Gas Transmission Company, were flying a company DC-3 from Beaumont to Houston, Texas, when they encountered a UFO. At about 9:45 p.m., as they were flying over Pasadena at 1500 feet, an object "with three large, white, brilliant lights" darted in front of their aircraft. "It was going from south to north," said Hancock, a veteran of 12 years in the air. "We were going at least 200 miles an hour, and it went by us easily." He said that it hovered, then sped off, had no navigation lights, and acted unlike an airplane. The brilliance of the object's lights kept the pilots from getting a definite idea of its shape. "I still don't know what it was," Miller said. "When it wanted to, it kept ahead of us easily. It would stop, or seem to stop, just under us. We would bank around, get close to it and it would be gone again." They got with a quarter-mile of the object. "I got the idea that it was at least the size of our plane," Hancock said. "I know that it knew we were following it." It was just messing around with us. I know that we were following it.

The object was seen approaching Ellington, Air Force Base, and it "cut across military traffic." At the time the object vanished, it seemed to be 200 feet over the runway, proceeding southward. "We flashed our landing lights at the object, but there was no reaction." Both men notified Ellington AFB, and Houston International Airport and Ellington officials were investigating. Hancock said the civil aeronautic tower's radar operator reported to him by radio that he had picked up an object close to the plane's position, then lost it; but UP reported that the "Air Force was unable to pick up the flying object on its radar." --Houston Chronicle, Mar. 9; Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Mar. 9; Washington Post & Times Herald, Mar. 10 (UP); Newark Sunday News, Mar. 10 (UP); N. Y. Times, Mar. 10 (UP).

8 XZ March 1957
74° 20' West, 30° North
En route from Nassau to
New York

PAN-AM PILOT TRACKS UFO ON RADAR

March 29, 1957: Piloting Pan American Flight #206A from Nassau to New York, Captain Ken Brodal (who will be remembered as one of the pilots involved in the Van Winkle sighting of March 8, 1957) and two of his crew watched a UFO both visually and on radar as it "dogged" them at their speed, moving in the same direction, southeast of their plane. At about 7:30 p.m., their position was 74° 20' West, 30° North; they were flying at 16,000 feet through the tops of cumulus clouds. John Wilbur, the engineer, was in the co-pilot's seats; co-pilot George Jackson was navigating, and saw the object first, Brodal writes:

"About 50 miles east of Papa 3 - a check point between Nassau and Tuna - the co-pilot, engineer and myself saw a very bright white light. It seemed to grow in intensity to the point where it would be about three or four times as strong as Venus rising and would then subside. This happened three or four times; meanwhile, I came to' enough to check the radar screen. Sure enough, a target showed up at 3 o'clock, 45 to 50 miles away. Using the cursor on the face of the radar, I checked angle of sighting and it checked with the visual angle.

"The light appeared to be stationary (on the scope), or moving in a northeast direction (same as us). We watched the light visually for about four or five minutes, and on radar another twenty minutes. Neither the light nor the blip had any definite shapes; the radar image indicated that it was larger than normal aircraft. The scope was tuned to a 50-mile range. What impressed Captain Brodal most was the intensity of the light in its bright phases. After perhaps four cycles of brightening and dimming, the light faded out slowly and completely. Captain Brodal did not alert the passengers, and apparently no one in the cabin of the plane saw it."

SATIS-3/\2] Tucker/jmd/74966

27 February 1957

Dear Professor [redacted]:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 20 January 1957 concerning a Pitchell air mass sighting over the Gulf States on 15 March 1957.

Our files indicate that we have received no report of that particular air ball sighting. We do have records of a partial sighting of only 9 March 1957, and this has resulted in considerable publicity and nationwide attention. This was the Pan-American Airlines Pitchell sighting of 9 March 1957, between this incident over the Atlantic, east of Savannah, Georgia. If you desire the data on this sighting, we will be happy to forward it to you.

Many sightings of this nature are reported directly to newspapers, astronomical observatories or other agencies, and never come to the attention of the Air Force. The Air Force does not take cognizance of reports not officially reported to it.

The implication that reports of this nature are usually classified or may be withheld by the Air Force from possible clearance is erroneous. Only the press can access, confidential, and classified aspects of investigations, analysis, sites and equipment. In every case, Air Force policy has a standing policy of keeping the public informed regarding unidentified flying objects through periodic releases; a copy of the latest is obtained for your information.

Your report on matters and bodies has been reviewed with much interest and will become a part of our permanent files on this subject.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES                                        1958 January 28

The Commanding Officer, ATIC, Air Science Div., 
Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Sir:

Before making my request, I had better tell you my official position so that you understand the better why I make it. I am president (and founder) of the American Meteor Society, and emeritus professor of Astronomy University of Penna. From 1923-1954, when I had to retire by automatic rule, I was director of the Flower and Cook Observatories. I have published scores of papers on the subject of meteors and fire-balls, the last important one of which is enclosed, On pages 113 and 314 you will find a table of fire-ball paths and orbits, more extensive than all others ever published by an American astronomer.

Now as to request- On 1957 March 15 at about 10 p.m., C.S.T., a very brilliant fireball or meteor in the United States over the Gulf States area, probably S.W. of New Orleans, in or near the Gulf. From the Navy Dept. I have one good observation from a ship, and by newspaper clippings reports by very many people, most of small value, as coordinates are not given.

As the object was so brilliant, there seems every chance that numerous observations were sent to your central where "Flying saucers" etc. are worked on.

Further, as this was an astronomical body, with nothing mysterious about it, there can be no reason why reports should be classified or held from reputable scientists.

I am therefore requesting you to have the reports on this object mailed to me on loan, so that I can compile its meteorological path and if possible its orbit in space. The reports will be carefully returned, and I will be happy to communicate the results I obtain.

As I served on the scientific staff of Aberdeen Proving Ground during 1918 and 1919, and as local consultant during the Second World War, I had the proper clearance.

Very sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]

March 20, 1957. At Charlotte, North Carolina, five small, spherical objects were seen floating 30 feet in the air just over the rooftops of the buildings along Central Avenue, by Mr. and its _____, as they were returning to its office at _____ Central Avenue, about 8:45 p.m., after mailing some letters.

White in color, the objects "were like bubbles ... about the size of a basketball. They didn't have any light of their own; they just reflected lights on the ground." One of them broke away from the others and began to change color, to red. Then I saw that it was just reflecting red light from the State Farm sign out front." The other four objects "sailed off" and the fifth slipped toward the ground and splattered against the asphalt of Central Avenue." It sounded like a thin sheet of ice slapping against the ground."

[Name] and his wife found the street wet where the object had hit, and moisture had spread over a 15-foot area. "It felt slippery to the touch," like an alkaline solution, "and was 'cooling or numbing' to his fingers." "I have a cold and couldn't smell it, but my wife said it smelled sort of like burnt matches." This case seems like good evidence for "unknown aerial life-forms," -Charlotte Observer, Mar. 22.

23 March 1957
Ventura County, California

March 23, 1957. In California, Ventura County Deputies [redacted] on patrol in the Ventura-Camarillo area, reported seeing a reddish, glowing object in the sky near a runway at Oxnard Air Force Base, at 12:22 a.m. They said they watched it for some time near Camarillo and until 1:37 a.m., when it disappeared to the north. Two police officers at nearby Port Hueneme reported a similar sighting at about the same time. Mrs. [redacted], wife of an officer at the air base, telephoned the field shortly after midnight to report what she described as a "brilliant, flashing red object" in the sky over Santa Rosa Valley. A jet interceptor, in the air at the time, was ordered to check, but spotted nothing. Col. G. F. Carey, Jr., air base commander, said that a radar check proved negative. --Los Angeles Mirror-News, Mar. 23 (Credit: Mrs. Isabel Epperson).

Dear Sirs:

Would your office kindly confirm the incident reported by the Tacoma, Washington News Tribune, April 2, 1957, which describes the sighting of a UFO by _______ in, or near, Tacoma, Washington, March 23, 1957.

According to the News Tribune, _______ watched an object with a metallic glow descend in the pasture on his parent's property on Waller Road. The newspaper's account told of Air Force Intelligence investigating and relating to it. _______ the following: "Perhaps it is just as well we ran." Then, according to the News Tribune, the Air Force investigating team of three men told _______ of an incident, similar to his, occurring in Florida. They said it involved a woman walking along a road who had become transfixed with fear by a flying object but while turning toward her silently, the craft knocked her down to the ground. There were witnesses, but when the woman was reached she was found dead with severe burns on her body.

According to ______'s story, recounted by the News Tribune, the Air Force team related that whatever the objects may be (referring to UFO's) they are not craft launched by the US. Air Force or any other nation on earth. One of the men told _______ that there is virtual proof that three planets are inhabited.

First, I should have the incident confirmed, that is, time and place. Secondly, did the Air Force investigate? Third. Please elaborate on the reference to the Florida incident, involving the woman who was killed. Without mentioning the woman's name, is this incident on official Air Force record in the case files?

Fourth: Has the UFO witnessed by _______ and others, been identified?

If at all possible, please answer the above questions fully.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for February 23, 1957

MEDICINE
Industrial Noise Is Tough Problem to Doctors

> THE EFFECTS of noise are becoming a serious problem to industry, workers and physicians, Dr. C. Stewart Nash, Director of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, told the annual meeting of the International College of Surgeons in New York.

The problem is who is responsible for long-term hearing loss that occurs among workers.

Occasionally a worker becomes fatigued or irritable if the noise around him is too great, but he may also become hard of hearing if exposed to a clatter that is too intense for the ear to withstand, Dr. Nash added.

The physician dealing with industrial deafness is faced with conflicting forces, he added.

Dr. Nash is sometimes asked to testify for a worker that his hearing "was caused by plant noise and is permanent in nature." Industry, on the other hand, while wanting to compensate employees who actually are deaf, wants the ear specialist to rule out disablements that happened years ago, Dr. Nash reported.

A third party, the insurance company, wants to distinguish between a temporary hearing loss and a permanent one, the physician added.

"In efforts to make the best of a bad situation, labor, industry, workers' compensation boards, industrial commissions and underwriters are constantly jockeying for positions advantageous to their own point of view," he said.

But progress in reducing damaging plant noise is being made as a result of studies of the types and intensities of noise that can and do produce occupational deafness, he concluded.

MEDICINE
Tranquilizers Endanger Emotional Health

> TRANQUILIZING drugs can endanger your emotional health as well as your physical, Dr. Herman A. Dickel and Dr. Henry H. Dixon, of the Oregon Medical School, Portland, warn in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Feb. 9).

The psychiatric studies show the effects of the drugs in 4,000 patients suffering from anxiety neurosis. Some became so depressed enough to commit suicide, some suffered serious emotional breakdown, and others experienced serious emotional problems.

EDUCATION
To Survey Universities' Overseas Activities

> WHAT do American universities do overseas? The Carnegie Corporation of New York has made a grant of more than a quarter of a million dollars to Michigan State University to find out.

The grant will enable the Michigan researchers to appraise the wide variety of programs in all parts of the world in which U. S. universities are active, including the technical assistance programs sponsored by the federal government.

Grants, totaling more than $1,000,000, were made by the Corporation for studies in the international field. Others of the grants include money to Columbia University to study the 40 Russian area experts to make short trips to the Soviet Union; a grant to the American Council on Education's ROTC programs, to be done at Dartmouth College, Hanover, N. H., and an additional grant to the Common Council for American Unity to translate into Hungarian the handbook for immigrants, which is called "Life in America."

CHEMISTRY
Watered Down, Reheated Minerals "Fluoresce"

> THE FACT that some minerals turn bluish-green under ultraviolet or "black light" when they are watered down or reheated, might prove to be a new tool for studying the surface of solids.

A description of how a large number of studies involving minerals show that because they had adsorbed water as reported in Nature (Feb. 9), by R. Przibram of the Institute fur Radiumforschung, Vienna, Austria.

Calling the phenomenon fluorescence, he points out that the colorful fluorescence does not appear after the samples have been heated strongly for a short time, but it returns when they are either kept for months or exposed to the air or when they are wetted.

"Rather surprisingly," the Austrian scientist says, the fluorescence is also regenerated when the strongly heated samples are treated again to a less degree.

This he calls the reversibility of fluorescence, by analyzing the way minerals react with the possibility of fluorescence.

During cooling in open air, water vapor condenses on the surface. When excited by received heating, the water molecules are bound more strongly to the surface and this can be fluorescence.

ASTRONOMY                SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for February 23, 1957

Jupiter Shines All Night
Spring comes for the Northern Hemisphere as the sun crosses the equator on March 20 while it marks the first day of autumn for the Southern Hemisphere.

By JAMES STOKLEY

▶ THE PLANET JUPITER, which continues to be the most prominent star or planet now visible, will be directly overhead at 9 p.m. this month.

On St. Patrick's day it will be directly overhead at 9 p.m., which means that it will be visible all night, rising at sunset and setting at the sunrise. It is now in the constellation of Virgo, the virgin, whose evening position is shown on the accompanying maps.

These depict the sky as it looks about 10 p.m. your own variety of standard time, on March 1. By the middle of the month, it will look this way at nine o'clock, while at the end of March the right of the appearance is indicated. Virgo is seen toward the east.

Jupiter is now of magnitude minus 2 on the astronomical scale, or more that again as bright as Sirius, the brightest star, and it is very to locate. Also in Virgo is the first magnitude star called Spica, which is so close to the horizon on March evening that its light is greatly reduced.

Above Virgo stands Leo, the lion, with the bright star Regulus. This orb, with a remarkable of its true form, forms a little figure known as the Sickle. Regulus marks the end of the handle, which points downward.

Winter Constellations Going

With winter now approaching its end, the constellations that characterize that season are getting ready to bow off the celestial stage.

They are seen in the southwest, instead of being high in the south, as they were a month or two ago. The most familiar, perhaps, is Orion, the warrior. There are in a row his belt, while Betelgeuse is above and Rigel below.

Just to the right is Taurus, the bull, with Aldebaran. Above Orion we find Gemini, the twins, with Castor and Pollux, the bright stars that mark this constellation.

Coming down in Cams Major, the greater dog, is Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, passing the faint figure of Monoceros, the unicorn, toward the lower dog, Canis Minor, with the star called Procyon.

Singing around toward the northern sky, Auriga, the charioteer, can be located to the right of Taurus, with the star Capella. High in the northeast is the familiar figure of the great dipper, which is really part of Ursa Major, the great bear. In the bowl of the dipper are the two stars known as the pointers.

A line through them, downward and to the left at present, takes you to Polaris, the pole star, which always marks the north, since it stands directly over the north pole. The handle of the dipper also is a pointer for following its curve toward the east one comes to Arcturus, in Bootes, the bearer, tenth and last of the first magnitude stars seen on March evening.

Sun Over Equator

One welcome astronomical event occurs on the afternoon of March 20, for on that date (at 4:17 p.m., EST), the sun will stand directly over the equator. Since December it has been moving northward in the sky, and now it reaches the half-way point of its journey.

It rises directly east, and sets directly west, so day and night are equal length. This is the time of the "equinox," which means "equal nights."

In the Northern Hemisphere this is the beginning of spring, but in the Southern Hemisphere it is the first day of autumn.

While the sun during the winter was so low for us, it was high for them, and they could enjoy the warm weather of summer.

With Orion and his neighbors now descending into the west, and Leo and Virgo just coming up in the east, the center of the celestial stage, i.e., the part of the sky directly south, is occupied by a number of interesting but less conspicuous constellations. One of these, Monoceros, has already been mentioned as standing between the two dogs, Canis Major and Canis Minor. The brightest star in it is of the fourth magnitude, so it is not conspicuous.

Argo Has Four Parts

The group is so big that it is subdivided into four parts, each considered as a constellation. Puppis is the "poop," or stern; Vela the sail and Pyxis the compass. The fourth, Carina, the keel, is not shown. It is farther south and contains the brilliant star called Canopus.

In the southern states of the United States it comes into view, but not for points that are north of 38 degrees latitude.
