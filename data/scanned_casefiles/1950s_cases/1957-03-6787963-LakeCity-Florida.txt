Dear Miss [REDACTED],

This replies to your letter in which you reported an unidentified observation you made approximately ten years ago. 

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will be sure your letter becomes a part of our project files. At this late date, it is impractical to investigate the individual report in detail; however, your observation as soon as possible. This enables Air Force analysis to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Your interest in the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects is appreciated. I have included the 1957 report on our project.

It rapidly rose almos=t perpendicular.

As it appeared came down again on the same track or course,
about 1 minute to a minute and a half in duration.

When i saw it again it seemed to be stationary for the night
i saw that i estimated to go about 1000 miles per hour

Typical.
This may have been a hallucination.

8 MARCH 1957
HOUSTON, TEXAS

OBJECT SEEN OVER TEXAS
HOUSTON, TEX., March 9 (AP) - Five residents of this city reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Houston this evening. The object, which played "cat-and-mouse" with another object said to be a plane, was described as circular, about 30 feet in diameter, and glowing with a whitish-green light. It was first sighted about 7 p.m. and was then seen playing a game of "tag" with the plane for about 20 minutes. Tex Johnston, a pilot who observed the objects, said the unidentified object seemed to be playing a game of speed and maneuverability with the plane. Hancock said he was convinced the object was under intelligent control. The object appeared and disappeared rapidly, then would zoom back into sight, changing direction swiftly.

The image does not contain a photograph, it is a page of text from an old Project Blue Book report.

March 8, 1957. Victor Hancock and Guy Milier, pilots for Tennessee Gas Transmission Company, were flying a company DC-3 from Beaumont to Houston, Texas, when they encountered a UFO. At about 7:15 PM, as they were flying over Palacios at 1,500 feet, an object with three large, white, brilliant lights started in front of their aircraft. The object was going south, it was said, "and veered off high and fast, lost by us easily." He said that it hovered, then sped off, had no navigation lights, and acted under complete control. The brilliance of this object's lights kept the pilots from getting a definite idea of its shape. "I still don't know what it was," Milier said, "when it wanted to, it seemed to stop, just under us. I would bank around, get close to it and it would be gone again." They got further details of the object's lights keeping the pilots from studying its shape. At the time the object vanished, "it was just massing around with us." The report was approaching Ellington Air Force Base's main runway by the pilots, and it "cut across military traffic." At the time the object vanished, it was said to be "200 feet over runway." One Ellington AFB, and Houston International Airport and Ellington officials were investigating. Hancock said the civil helicopter's power plant scares radar operator reported to him by radio that he had picked up an object close to the plane's position, then lost it, but up reported that the twin force was unable to pick up the target.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be text from a Project Blue Book report, describing a Pan-Am pilot's sighting of a UFO on radar during a flight from Nassau to New York on March 22, 1957. The text provides a detailed account of the pilot's observations, including the object's appearance, movement, and behavior as observed through the plane's radar and visual sighting.

PAN-AM PILOT TRACKS UFO ON RADAR:
March 22, 1957: Piloting Pan American flight #206A from Nassau to New York, Captain William Neff will be remembered as one of the pilots involved in the Van Winkle sighting of March 8, 1957) and two of his crew watched a UFO both visually and on radar as they were returning to New York, southeast of their plane. At about 7:30 p.m. their position was 74 20' north, 72 35' west, some 900 miles southeast of their position when Captain Van Winkle sighted the object on March 8th. 

Captain Neff, "When we picked up the target on our radar it showed up about 15,000 feet higher than we were, and as it approached us it seemed to descend to about 10,000 feet above us. At that time it was not visible to the eye, but the radar showed it plainly. Then it steadied down off to the right of our plane and held a steady course about 10 miles away. The target was erratic in movement, sometimes hovering, sometimes speeding up. We notified the CAA and Eastern Air Lines control centers about the object." First Officer George Jacobson was navigating, and saw the object first. Brodahl writes:

"About 50 miles east of Florida we saw a strange object it seemed to be a bright shining light. The co-pilot, engineer and myself saw a very bright white light. It seemed to be stationary to the point where it would be about three or four times as strong as Venus rising and would then subside. This happened three or four times. We called up on the intercom to the captain 'I don't know if you can see it from there, but we see a very bright light out there. It's hard to be sure, but it appears to be stationary.'"

Using the cursor on the radar, "I checked the angle of sighting and it checked with the light we were observing." Sure enough, the radar showed a target at that exact spot.

"The light appeared to be stationary (on the scope), or moving in a northeast direction (same as us). We watched the light visually for about four minutes, and on radar for twenty minutes. Neither the light nor the blip on the radar moved far from the blip. The scope was turned to a 50-mile range. What impressed Captain Brodahl most was the intensity of the light in 423 bright phases. After perhaps four cycles of brightening and dimming, the light faded out slowly and completely. Captain Brodahl did not alter the passengers, and apparently no one in the cabin of the plane saw it."

27 February 1953

Dear Professor,

This is to confirm for your letter of 20 February 1953 concerning our interest in your sketches of an unidentified aerial object which was observed over Lake City, Florida on 13 March 1952.

Our Air Technical Intelligence Center has received no report of that particular incident. We do have records of several aerial sightings, reports and case histories, but this particular one does not seem to be included. If you do have a written account of this incident, it would be greatly appreciated if you could send us a copy of it. We would be most interested in obtaining all the details possible concerning this event.

Many sightings of this nature are reported directly to the Air Force. As you know, the Air Force is charged with the responsibility for the investigation of the Air Force. Any person does go into the direction of the Air Force, and especially reported to us.

The implication that the contents of this picture may usually classified or may be withheld by the Air Force from available statistics or reports is possible. An incidents of this nature are considered classified aspects of investigations, trials and legal restraints, and other unclassified aspects of investigations generally are published or distributed for public information. If we do find this case in our files, it may indicate that it is in the category of classified incidents not usually made available to public.

Your report on records and details has been reviewed with much interest and will become a part of our permanent files on this subject.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

LEONARD J. CALDER
Lieutenant Colonel, USAF
Chief, Technical Analysis Division

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
PHILADELPHIA

FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES
1955 January 25

The Commanding Officer, U.S.C. & G.S.,
United Pettersen Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Sir:

Before making my request, I had better tell you my official position so that you understand the background why I am writing. I am president of the Flower and Cook Observatories, and assistant professor of astronomy. At my request, a former director of the Flower and Cook Observatories, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, had to retire automatically at 68. I was director of the Flower and Cook Observatories; I am no longer, and the last important one of which is enclosed. On pages 115 and 116 you will find that I am still director of research. I hope this explains that all others have been replaced.

Now as to my request: On 1957 March 15 at about 10 p.m. (E.S.T.), a very brilliant object passed over the United States. Most reliable newspaper clippings report it was observed by very many people, most of small value, as coordinates are not given.

At the object was so brilliant, there seems every chance that some photographer happened to take a picture of it. If so, and if possible its orbit in space can be determined, and if possible its orbit in space can be determined, and if will be highly appreciated. The reports will be carefully returned, and if possible its orbit in space can be determined, and if will be highly appreciated.

I served on the scientific staff of the Air Force during the Second World War. I had the proper clearance.

Very respectfully yours,

Dept. of Astronomy, 
University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia 4, Pa.

The text in the document is as follows:

"March 20, 1957 at Charlotte, North Carolina, five small, spherical objects were seen floating 30 feet in the air over the buildings along Central Avenue. As they were returning to the office of the National Guard, about 8:45 p.m., they suddenly stopped and hovered over the buildings. They didn't have any light of their own; they just reflected lights on the ground. One of them broke away from the others and began to change color. It started out red, then brighter than I saw that it was just reflecting red light from the State Farm office windows. The other objects seemed to be glued off and the fifth ship-ped together. The whole thing was like a thin sheet of ice slapping against the ground. When the object had hit, and moisture had spread over a 15-foot area. "It felt slippery to the touch, like an alkaline solution," and was "recalling or numbing" to his fingers. "It have a cold and couldn't smell it, but it seemed to have a smell." This case seems like a border incident. "C-2-a". Charlotte, N.C.—."

March 23, 1957.  In California, Ventura County Deputies were reported seeing a red, glowing object in the sky near a runway at Oxnard Air Force Base. The object was sighted from 12:22 a.m. until 1:37 a.m., when it disappeared to the north. Two police officers at near by Point Mugu sighting a similar object about the same time. Around midnight, the sky over Santa Rosa Valley was reported to contain a "brilliant, flashing red object." This was ordered to be checked, but nothing was spotted. Col. E. F. Carey, Jr., air base commander, was informed of the incident. (Credit: Mrs. Isabel Pppperson).

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

Dear Sirs:

Would your office kindly confirm the incident reported by the Tacoma, Washington News Tribune, April 2, 1957, which described the sighting of a UFO by, or near, Tacoma, Washington, March 23, 1957.

According to the News Tribune, a private citizen observed an object with a metallic glow descend in the vicinity of his parent's property on Miller Road. The News Tribune's description of this incident was as follows: "Perhaps it is just as well that no one was able to see the craft more closely. This was the conclusion of the Washington policeman who investigated the incident. He was afraid that if it involved a woman walking along a road who had become terrified with fear, a close approach by the craft knocked her down to the ground. There were witnesses, but when the woman was reached she was found to be unconscious."

According to the News Tribune's story, recorded by the Air Force team investigating the incident, they could not determine any connection to UFOB's. They are not craft launched by the U.S. Air Force or any other nation on earth. One of the men who observed the incident is virtually proof that these planets are inhabited.

First, I should the incident confirmed, that is, time and place. Secondly, did the Air Force investigate? Thirdly, please illustrate on the reference to the Florida incident involving the woman who was killed. Without mentioning the woman's name, this incident is virtual proof that these planets are inhabited.

Fourth: Has the UFO witnessed by XXXXX and others, been identified?

If at all possible, please answer the above questions fully.

Science News Letter for February 23, 1957

Many normal people who go to their physician for satisfactory and comfortable treatment sometimes feel that a "casual" examination and evaluation and a prescription for a new tranquilizer is not sufficient. The patients returned to complain of unspecified symptoms, often vague, and it was pointed out to them that there was no known physical basis for their complaints. They were told that no more deeply seated illness was present. They were urged to feel that the tranquil manner, the philosophical outlook, and the proper attitude would be adequate, but this was rejected.

The problem of industrial noise is a serious one to industry, workers and physicians. Dr. Howard Schechter, University of Rochester, N. Y., told the Regional Institute of the Industrial Hygiene Society of Chicago, Ill., that the problem who is responsible for this difficulty. This physiological problem is often described as "industrial noise is tough."

The problem who is responsible is that annoying noise which people encounter in factories, in hospitals, in offices and in many other industrial and commercial establishments. The noise may not be loud enough to produce deafness, but it may become an irritant and annoyance that results in fatigue, nervousness and lack of concentration.

Dr. Nash is sometimes asked to testify in lawsuits that involve claims of hearing loss due to industrial noise. On the other hand, while seeking compensation for employees, he must be careful to rule out disablements that happened gradually over the years as opposed to sudden trauma.

It is not always easy to distinguish between a temporary impaired loss and a permanent one, said Nash. Efforts to make the best of a bad situation by improving noise control often prove disappointing, for the measures taken may not remove the noise but merely reduce it to a level still disabling.

The patients are told that their emotional and tension problems must not be confused with this physical handicap. While the physician may believe that tranquilizers would help, the patients want something more visible that identifies their plight.

Tranquilizers Endanger Emotional Health

TRANQUILIZING drugs can endanger your emotional health, Dr. Herman A. Dickel and Hobart B. Dornbush, M.D., told the American Medical Association.

In an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 162, they said: "Since the tranquilizing drugs do not cure the underlying condition, they may actually delay the acquisition of the normal resources for coping with emotional problems, and they may thus prove to be a mixed blessing at best and a serious handicap at worst."

The authors point out that the extensive use of tranquilizing drugs has created some problems because they tend to conceal problems rather than cure them. While they may make the patient feel better, they do not attack the basic source of emotional disturbance.

Physiology

Brain Stroke Condition Not Found in Animals

• THE FACT is that some minerals which have been detected in the human brain but have not been found in animals, including those which are related to the so-called brain stroke condition, might prove to be a new clue for studying the surface structures of neuroblastoma cells.

Calling the phenomenon "fluorescence," Dr. M. Peisach of the Institute of Nuclear Studies, Vienna, Austria, points out that the manner in which the human brain accumulates these minerals, such as mercury, has not yet been properly understood.

Dr. Peisach says that the colorful fluorescence does not appear for the animals have been found to lack the ability to accumulate these minerals in the way the human brain does. He thinks this might be a significant factor when one considers the problem of brain cell metabolism as related to the nature of the tumor process and how it arises.

Further experiments, he says, are needed to clarify the mechanisms through which the human brain can accumulate these trace mineral elements, when the normally heated tissue samples are stained again in a less rigorous way.

This indicates the characteristic of fluorescence of some tumor cells might be related to the ability of the human brain to accumulate certain trace mineral elements, a phenomenon not observed in animals.

Watered Down, Reheated Minerals "Fluorescent"?

ASTRONOMY

Jupiter Shines All Night

Spring comes for the Northern Hemisphere as the sun crosses the equinox on March 20 while it ushers in the first day of autumn for the Southern Hemisphere.

By JAMES STOKLEY

"THE great Jupiter, which conpains enough material to make 12.5 Earths, is now prominent in the night sky. On St. Patrick's day it was the directly overhead towards the south and will continue to dominate the evening sky for some months, reaching its highest point in the constellations of Virgo, the virgin, whose eastern horizon it now occupies.

These depict the sky as it looks about an hour after sunset. High overhead is the ringed planet Saturn, which by the end of the month will be setting about an hour after sunset. Jupiter is now of magnitude minus 2.2, ranking among the brightest objects outside the sun and moon, and is easy to locate. Also in Virgo is the first-magnitude star Spica, which marks the ear of grain in the virgin.

Among other things that its light is greatly reduced. Among the figures shown in the sky, the most prominent is the Sickle, Regulus marks the heart of the Lion. West of this is the Big Dog, Canis Major, with the bright star Sirius, which is the brightest star in the sky.

With winter now approaching, its end, the constellations that characterize the night sky are changing. In the southwest, instead of the bright stars of summer, such as Scorpius, the Scorpion, and Antares, its brightest star, we now see Orion, the warrior, and Sirius, in Canis Major, the great Dog Star. Just to the right is Taurus, the bull, with its V-shaped cluster of bright stars, the Hyades, and the brighter, solitary star Aldebaran.

Coming from Rigel, one of the first magnitude stars in Orion's feet, is a ray of brilliant blue-white light, which shows this star to be one of the hottest and most luminous in the night sky. Above this group, almost overhead, are the dim but interesting stars of Monoceros, the Unicorn.

To the north, the familiar groups that make up the Great Bear, or Ursa Major, and the Little Bear, or Ursa Minor, are now high in the northeast. The bright pointer stars that indicate the way to the Pole Star at the end of the Little Bear's tail are conspicuous. The Pole Star itself, while not the brightest, is still a familiar landmark in the northern sky.

Sun Over Equator

One astronomical event of importance occurs on March 20, when the sun will cross the equator at 3:47 a.m. (EST). On that date it will stand directly over the equator. Since December 21, it has been moving northward, in its course across the sky, and now it reaches the half-way point toward the summer solstice.

From this time on, days and night are of equal length. From the time of the vernal or spring equinox, days in the Northern Hemisphere steadily increase in length until the summer solstice in June, the beginning of spring, but in the Southern Hemisphere it is the first day of autumn.

Since at this time of year the sun appears to move more rapidly across the sky, it was high for them, and they could readily see the weather conditions attending the vernal equinox.

One of the signs which indicates the approaching spring in the Northern Hemisphere is the fact that Virgo, the Virgin, and Leo, the Lion, are now just rising in the east and will be prominent throughout the night. Their appearance is a harbinger of the change of seasons which is about to take place.
