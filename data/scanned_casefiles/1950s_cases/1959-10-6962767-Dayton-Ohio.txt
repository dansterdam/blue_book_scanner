100-Foot Balloon Shot
To 250-Mile Altitude
                From Wire Dispatches
WALLOPS ISLAND, Va. Oct. 28—Space scientists shot
a 100-foot balloon to an altitude of 250 miles over the
Atlantic ocean about dusk today. The big inflatable sphere
created wonderment among millions along the eastern seaboard from South Carolina to Maine.

The launching was a test of the inflatable satellites
which later will be used in communication experiments, as
reflectors of radio and radar beams in space.

The national aeronautics and space administration (NASA)
said the experiment achieved (its) aim of testing the vehicle's ejection and inflation machinery.

The two-stage launching rocket, producing 120,000 pounds of
thrust, poured out a bright vapor trail in the evening sky which
contributed to the wide visibility.

Newspaper, radio and police switchboards all along the coast
were flooded with calls.

"The craziest thing in the world," said Prof. Robert Brown,
director of the moonwatch station in New Haven, Conn. who
tracked the object with his telescope without knowing what it
was.

An elderly unidentified lady told the Portland, Maine, weather
bureau: "Such goin's scare me. It
looked like the Russians to me."

At takeoff, the inflatable balloon carried by a 5½-ton rocket
was jammed into a magnesium container only 25½ inches in
diameter. After ejection, it measured 100 feet in diameter.
So large it would barely fit in the street between two big city
buildings, it weighed only about 130 pounds.

The first stage consisted of a Sergeant solid propellant rocket
with two smaller Recruit rockets to increase the initial thrust.

The second stage was an Alcyon ballistics laboratory X-248 solid propellant rocket which later will serve as a third stage for the Delta launching vehicle.

The sphere was made of mylar plastic coated with aluminum
half of one-thousandth of an inch thick.

It was visible for about 10 minutes before it dropped. NASA said it was unable to determine at once how far the sphere traveled before it fell into the Atlantic. Its peak altitude was 253 statute miles.

Inflation of the balloon was begun by residual air inside it. Inflation was completed when a four pounds of water, released from two plastic bags, vaporized, fully inflating the 523,598 cubic foot sphere.

HUGE SPACE BALLOON DWARFS TECHNICIANS
Inflated 350 Miles Above Earth

Big Balloon
Spectacular
Thing to See

WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.—(JP)—
The United States has a spec-
tacular new entry in the space
age—a balloon as big a 1 1/2
city building that inflates 250
miles above the earth.

The first space balloon launch-
ing yesterday at Wallops Island,
Va., was a smashing success.
Not only did the balloon perform
as planned, but it also startled
the dickens out of hundreds
of witnesses all over the Eastern Seaboard.

The balloon, 100 feet in di-
ameter, was the biggest object
ever sent up into the vast re-
gions of space. But it only
weighed 130 pounds.

It was not meant to go into
orbit, and soon fell back into
the atmosphere. It was visible
for 10 minutes. Later, the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration put some of these giant travelers into orbit around
the earth.

The photograph shows a large inflated white balloon against a dark background, appearing to fill most of the image.

Here is the text from the document:

CIVIL DEFENSE Official
checked in with their head-
quarters within minutes. News-
paper, police and radio station
switchboards were alerted with calls from the pub-
lic or the newspapers.

The balloon was sent up in a
two-stage rocket with a thrust
of 100,000 pounds. This is about
the space agency's payload.

The whole huge balloon was
folded into a container 20 x
inches in diameter. The entire
payload, container and all
weighed 150 pounds.

The sphere was made of plas-
tic and coated with silvery
aluminum outside.

After the balloon was released
20 miles up, air trapped inside
it began to expand. The point
where it was released was a
bag was released inside the
water expanding into vapor and
completed the blowing up of the
balloon. A full size 11 contained
50,338 cubic feet.

The balloon carried no elec-
tronic instruments.

WALLOPS ISLAND, VA., OCT. 22.--CPIB--AMERICAN ROCKET SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM DELEGATES WITNESSED A SUCCESSFUL TWO-STAGE LAUNCHING OF A RESEARCH ROCKET HERE TODAY.

THE FIRST STAGE CONSISTED OF A CAJUN ROCKET WHICH LIFTED A SECOND STAGE CARRYING LIGHTS FLYING KINEVAL OVER A WIDE AREA FROM RICHMOND, VA., AS FAR NORTH AS NEW YORK AND CONNECTICUT.

THE BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED BY THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) IN ITS CONTINUING EFFORT TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES THAT WILL LEAD TO PLACING ONE OF THE BALLOONS IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH.

THE SPACE AGENCY SAID THE EXPERIMENT ACHIEVED ITS ALTITUDE-SEEKING OBJECTIVE. THE VEHICLE'S FUNCTION AND INFLATION MECHANISM WAS SUCCESSFULLY TESTED AND PAROLED BACK TO EARTH. THE BALLOON WAS NOT MEANT TO GO INTO ORBIT.

THE TWO-STAGE LAUNCHING ROCKET PRODUCED 135,000 POUNDS OF THRUST, PRODUCED A BRIGHT VAPOR TRAIL IN THE WESTERN SKY WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO VIEWERS VISIBILITY.

VIEWERS IN NEW YORK CITY AND OTHER PORTIONS OF THE EASTERN SEABOARD OBSERVED THE OBJECT SHORTLY BEFORE 6 P.M., EST., ALONG THE VIRGINIA COAST. IT WAS LAUNCHED AT 5:45 P.M., EST., ALONG THE VIRGINIA COAST. NEW YORK POLICE SAID THEY RECEIVED 75 CALLS BY 5:15 P.M.

37A

ADD 1ST NIGHT LEAD BALLOON ALLOWS TEAM TO SEE 6.5 P.M. SOME WITNESSES CALLED THE BALLOON LOOKED LIKE A GIANT HELICOPTER. OTHERS SAID IT WAS SHOOTING JUST WHAT THEY SAW. SOME IN THE NEW YORK AREA SAW IT AS A GIANT HELICOPTER THAT WAS SHOOTING UP FLAMES. OTHERS SAID IT AS A VERY BRIGHT OBJECT.

AT ALEXANDRIA, VA., SAID THE BALLOON OR VAPOR TRAIL LOOKED LIKE A BLIP. THE LITTLE STILL LIES LIGHT.

THE GOVERNMENT HOPES TO PUT ONE OF THE BALLOONS INTO ORBIT TO CARRY OUT EXPERIMENTS WITH LONG-RANGE SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES.

USING GROUND-BASED EQUIPMENT IN THIS TRIAL AT TAKE-OFF, THE INFLATABLE BALLOON CAN BE 20-1/2 FEET IN DIAMETER. GROUND TRACKING A MAXIMUM CONTROL ONLY 20-1/2 MILES IS POSSIBLE.

THE BALLOON IS MADE OF PLASTIC WITH AN AL CORE ONLY 1/2 INCH THICK.

INFLATION OF THE BALLOON WAS COMPLETED WHEN IT DESCENDED AND LANDED IN THE ATLANTIC.

WALLOPS ISLAND, VA., OCT. 25.--(UP)--AMERICAN SCIENTISTS LAUNCHED A BALLOON TODAY ROCKETED A 100-FOOT ALUMINUM BALLOON TO AN ALTITUDE OF 250 MILES OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.

THE LAUNCHING TOUCHED OFF "FLYING SAUCER" REPORTS FROM BOSTON TO FLORIDA.

THE BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED BY THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND COAST ADMINISTRATION (NASA) IN A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS THE GOVERNMENT HOPES WILL LEAD TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EARTH.

THE SPACE AGENCY SAID THE EXPERIMENT ACHIEVED ITS AIM OF TESTING THE VEHICLE'S BALLOON AND INFLATION MACHINERY. DATA ON ITS PERFORMANCE WAS RADIOED BACK TO EARTH. THE BALLOON WAS "NOT MEANT TO GO INTO ORBIT."

THE TWICE-LAUNCHING ROCKET, PRODUCING 150,000 POUNDS OF THRUST, PRODUCED A BRIGHT VAPOR TRAIL IN THE EVENING SKY WHICH DISTRIBUTED TO THE WIDE VISIBILITY.

WITNESSES IN THE NEW YORK CITY AREA BEGAN REPORTING THE FLASHING OBJECT ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER IT WAS LAUNCHED AT 5:40 P.M., EST., FROM THE VIRGINIA COAST. NEW YORK POLICE SAID THEY RECEIVED 75 CALLS BY SELF POLICE.

WITNESSES DIFFERED WIDELY IN DESCRIBING JUST WHAT THEY SAW. SOME IN THE NEW YORK AREA SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A GIANT HELICOPTER THAT WAS FLOATING OFF PLACE. OTHERS SAID IT APPEARED TO RESEMBLE TWO PLANES IN FLASHLIGHT LIGHTS. THE BALLOON OF VAPOR METAL ALSO DESCRIBED AS LOOKING LIKE "A BLINK WITH LITTLE SILVER LIGHTS."

THE GOVERNMENT HOPES TO PUT ONE OR SIX BALLOONS INTO ORBIT NEXT YEAR TO CARRY OUT EXPERIMENTS IN THE LOWER UPPER ATMOSPHERE. THE BIG SPHERES ALSO COULD BE USED FOR RADAR EXPERIMENTS.

AT TAKEOFF, THE INFLATABLE BALLOON, AS JAMMED INTO A PACKAGE CONTAINER ONLY 26-1/2 INCHES IN DIAMETER, ATOP THE 3-1/2 TON ROCKET. AFTER EJECTION, IT ASSUMED 135 FEET IN DIAMETER. SO LARGE IT WOULD EASILY FIT IN THE CITY BUILDING, IT WEIGHED ONLY ABOUT 15 POUNDS.

IT WAS MADE OF PLASTIC WITH AN ALUM COAT ONLY 1/2-MIL THICK.

UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
WASHINGTON, OCT. 30--(UPI)--PUZZLED SCIENTISTS SOUGHT AN EXPLANATION TODAY FOR THE MYSTERIOUS DANCING LIGHTS SPOTTED HIGH IN THE SKY WHEN A GIANT BALLOON LAUNCHED WEDNESDAY EVENING AT WALLOPS ISLAND, VA.

THEY HAD EXPECTED THE ALUMINUM-COATED BALLOON, SIX AS A LONG THIN CYLINDER, TO GLOW BRIGHTLY AS A CAUSE TO SETTING SUN, BUT THEY WERE COMPLETELY UNPREPARED, SAID A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA), FOR WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SAW.

THIS HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED BY COMPETENT OBSERVERS AS DANCING LIGHTS, SCINTILLATIONS, SHOOTING SPARKS, AND FLASHING BEAMS REMINISCENT OF TWINKLING CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS.

IT WAS AN ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED PHENOMENON, THE NASA SPOKESMAN SAID, "AND THE SCIENTISTS ARE HUNTING FOR AN EXPLANATION."

THE BIG BALLOON, CRUMPLED INTO A 30-INCH CONTAINER, WAS ROCKETED INTO SPACE 250 MILES ABOVE THE ATLANTIC OFF NASA'S WALLOPS ISLAND STATION. TEST MECHANISMS FOR EJECTING IT FROM THE CONTAINER AND INFLATING IT TO ITS FULL 100-FOOT SIZE.

THE TEST, PRONOUNCED A COMPLETE SUCCESS, PAVES THE WAY FOR AN ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH AN ARTIFICIAL BALLOON AT CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., INTO A SATELLITE ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH.

SUCH A SATELLITE, SCIENTISTS SAY, SHOULD MAKE AN IDEAL REFLECTOR FOR USE IN LONG-DISTANCE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS, BECAUSE OF ITS HUGE SIZE AND LOW WEIGHT, ABOUT 150 POUNDS. THE BALLOON ALSO WOULD BE USEFUL IN MEASURING THE AIR DENSITY AT SATELLITE ALTITUDES.

THIS WOULD BE DETERMINED BY ATMOSPHERIC DRAG ON THE BALLOON.

IN WEDNESDAY'S ROCKET SHOT, THE BALLOON CAME DOWN ABOUT 500 MILES AT SEA, FIFTEEN DIFFERENT STATIONS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE TO CAPE CANAVERAL TRACKED THE SPHERE WITH RADARS, TELESCOPES OR CAMERAS FOR THE HALF-HOUR IT WAS ALOFT.

MORE M114JA

THEIR DATA AND FILMS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NASA'S LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER, HAMPTON VA., FOR SCIENTIFIC STUDY. THIS WILL DISCLOSE HOW LONG IT TOOK THE BALLOON, AFTER EJECTION FROM ITS CANISTER, TO INFLATE TO FULL SIZE.

SCIENTISTS HOPE ALSO TO FIND AN EXPLANATION FOR THE STRANGE LIGHT EFFECTS WHICH CAUSED HUNDREDS OF PERSONS UP AND DOWN THE COAST TO WONDER IF THEY WERE SEEING A GENUINE FLYING SAUCER.

ONE QUALIFIED OBSERVER SAID THE BALLOON PLOUGHED LIKE A FANTASTIC LIGHT WITH A GLOWING CENTRAL GLOBE RINGED BY MANY SPARKS. A LOT OF OFF-THE-CUFF EXPLANATIONS HAVE BEEN OFFERED. ONE SUGGESTION WAS THAT THE PARTLY CRUMPLED BALLOON, BEFORE COMPLETE INFLATION, REFLECTED THE SUNLIGHT WITH VARYING INTENSITY AS IT TURNED, PRODUCING A SPARKING EFFECT.

ANOTHER WAS THAT SOME OF THE WATER VAPOR, USED TO SWELL THE BALLOON, LEAKED OUT AND KNOW PARTICLES WHICH FLASHED ELECTRICALLY. THE POSSIBILITY ALSO WAS RAISED THAT ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICAL EFFECTS WERE INVOLVED.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for September 26, 1959

ASTRONOMY

Total Solar Eclipse Coming
A total solar eclipse, taking place on Oct. 2, is a highlight of the astronomical year. It will be visible in part of the United States.

By JAMES STOKLEY

THE MAIN feature on the astronomical program for October is the first total eclipse of the sun visible in any part of the United States or Canada since 1954 and the last until 1970. On Friday morning, Oct. 2, people who live east of a line extending from Lake Michigan to Tallahassee, Fla., will see the sun rise as a partial eclipse. The moon, that is, they will see it if the sky is clear along the eastern horizon.

And, for a few favored locations in Massachusetts (including Boston) and southern New Hampshire, the rising sun will be totally eclipsed. It will be completely hidden by the moon and its outer most layer, the corona, will be visible around it. With the intense glare of the solar disc cut off, the faint corona comes into view.

Of course, clouds or early-morning mists may well interfere with the view of the total eclipse around Boston. However, from Massachusetts, the path along which it is visible extends over the Atlantic Ocean, toward the Canary Islands and the coast of Africa. There a much better view is likely. Many astronomical expeditions have traveled to these locations, to make the observations that can best be carried out when the sun is thus hidden.

Jupiter and Saturn Seen

As for the evening skies of October, two bright planets are visible, but you will have to look rather early to see one of them. Jupiter, the brighter, is in the constellation of Scorpius, the scorpion, and sets at the beginning of October, only two hours after sunset. Thus it does not appear on the accompanying map, which depicts the sky as it appears about 10 p.m. your own kind of standard time (add one hour for daylight saving time) at the first of October, an hour earlier at the middle and two hours earlier at the end.

Jupiter is now about seven and a half times as bright as Saturn, the other planet, which is in Sagittarius, the archer. Part of this constellation is shown on our maps.

Just after the sun rises, Saturn will be a planet set in early October about four hours after the sun, just a little before the times for which our maps are drawn.

The brightest star of these evenings is Vega, high in the west in Lyra, the lyre. Second brightest is Capella, in Auriga, the charioteer, which is in the northeast. Then comes Altair, toward the southwest, in Aquila, a little to the left of Lyra.

And above Lyra (shown partly on the three hours before the sun). It is in the constellation of Leo, the lion, and it will be of maximum brilliance on Oct. 8. After that it will gradually fade and will go behind the sun next June, reappearing next autumn as a brilliant evening star. Mercury and Mars are now too nearly in line with the sun to be seen; the latter passes behind it on Oct. 20.

Referring again to the total eclipse, it is rather curious that the last two such events which were visible in the United States also were seen just after sunrise.

A total eclipse of the sun occurs when the moon's shadow sweeps across the earth. Because the sun is so much bigger than the moon the lunar shadow tapers to a point at about our distance. Sometimes it fails to reach earth at all. If at such a time the moon passes in front of the sun that body is not completely hidden; there is a ring of the solar disc visible around the moon, and we have what is called an annular eclipse.

But with a total eclipse, the tip of the shadow does reach the earth. It may be a hundred miles or so in diameter, and it sweeps across land and sea, from west to east, tracing out the long ribbon-shaped path of totality, from which the total eclipse is visible. Over a much larger area there is a partial eclipse, with the moon coming only partly in front of the sun.

On July 9, 1945, the shadow touched earth at sunrise in Idaho, so the path of totality started there and went northeast.

Then came one on June 30, 1954. The path
began at sunrise, in Nebraska and again
it went to the northeast.

This time the shadow touches earth as
the sun is rising. Then the path extends to
Gardner, Mass. Then the path goes from
the east, and on the coast near Boston.

eclipse lasts longest, about 15 seconds is
through Marblehead. Downtown Boston, but
miles northeast of downtown will be only
even from Marblehead the sun will be above
the horizon as totality stars. Even at this
above is clear, I low-lying mist may well
prevent observations.

Despite this, however, many astronomers
from the Boston area, as well as from other
parts of the United States, will set up instruments along the Massachusetts coast with
this region, hoping that luck will be with
them, and they will see this rare event.
But if they do not, they will only have
to wait until 1970 for the next total eclipse
of the sun visible in the United States. On
March 7, the path of totality will pass across
northern Florida and the coastline of Georgia and the Carolinas. This will be in mid-afternoon, so the weather chances should
be fairly good.

Observations of Unidentified Flying
Objects:
Friday, 23rd October 1959 Between 10
and 11 p.m. by Micah AIGABA, Registered Mission Teacher, Anglican Mission,
Fumani M.B.D. Papua. In the Daga
country at foot of Mt. Gwora Range.
A very big light came over from the
direction of Boiani (about 40 miles to
the S.E.) It came straight toward Mount
Gwora (a precipitous mountain about
4500 ft. high, which stands about 5 miles
E. of Fumani, dominating the scene).
At first it was quite low, but when it
reached the vicinity of Mt. Gwora it
ascended until it appeared to be vertically over the summit of the mountain.
It then hovered stationary for a long
time (an hour). The observer had no
watch. Finally it descended until it
seemed almost to touch the top of the
mountain, but moved away in a northward direction, keeping about the same
night, passing over Moiani and Medilo
and then veering eastwards and circling
round the coastline of the Cape Vogel
Peninsula (apparently), though it was
probably much nearer) and finally disappearing in the direction of Boiani
again.

The appearance of the light was round
a disc or a globe. It was dazzlingly
bright, especially when moving and
changed colour continuously, the basic
colours being green, red and yellow.
Parts of the object showed different
colours simultaneously. "It twinkled."
The colours changed about every three
minutes. (This seems contradictory, but
there it is). It was about equal to half
the size of the moon, but was far brighter. The "twinkle" when moving was "faster
than an aeroplane" i.e. a light aircraft.
It seemed to move larger and brighter
when moving. "Like a fire in the sky."
There was no roll or rays for the it
could be illuminated the ground (it was
probably too high).

Other witnesses: Anastasia Micah's
sister, John (mission helper) and Bawara, village chief and others unspecified.
