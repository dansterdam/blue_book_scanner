28 February 1953

I. Description of Incident

At 1800 EST an Air Force colonel while traveling at 60 mph in his auto near Richmond observed a clean of metal with a long narrow rectangular contrail traveling from south to north. The object crossed the path of the auto from left to right traveling at less than jet speed. The object was observed approximately 15 minutes.

Observer visited a friend of his about 1 hour later. The friend initiated the conversation by stating that he had seen a bright contrail in the sky about 1700 at a considerable distance. At 1830 EST on this date the sun was setting. The sun, reflecting from contrail, made it easily visible.

III. Conclusion

Probably contrail of jet aircraft.
