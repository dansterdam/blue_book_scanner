AIR FORCE PLANE DOWNED BY UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT

Case 170. In air over Pixley, Cal., July 22, 1956—The above headline quoted from the Rocky Mountain News, Denver, Colo., typifies others appearing in the nation's press. However, for the story we quote from the San Francisco Chronicle as follows: "A Hamilton AFB transport plane survived a good vertical dive and landed safely with three-fourths of its tail chewed missing. The pilot, co-pilot and crew of two all blacked out following a mysterious mid-air incident that no one was able to explain. Major Merwin Stenvers, the pilot, said the C-13TD, was cruising at 16,000 ft. over Pixley. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, a severe vibration and we went into a dive," he said. Major Stenvers had the plane under normal control at the time. While he and his co-pilot had to bring it out of the spin, the two crewmen were scrambling to regain their seat in the cabin. Finally, Stenvers saw the nose begin to come up, averting certain death. But then all four crew members blacked out. When he and his co-pilot, Capt. Robert Marble, came to, the plane was going almost straight up. He guessed the craft had dropped to 7,000 ft. before gaining strength. Major Stenvers was unable to explain what happened. He said he saw no other planes about him.

According to one UP report: One official said it looked like something had struck it from above. Another UP report said: The Air Force ordered tight security measures into effect and stationed armed guards at the airport. An AF report said that the sheriff's office investigated a report that another plane had crashed nearby but found no evidence."

Ed: Critics will say that this incident is "down the CRIFO stley"—True! While it ranks high on the suspense list, the case is by no means closed. We will await further evidence, and suggest that everyone read between the lines of this said case.

ADDENDUM.—As one reader put it, "Now comes the back tracking." In the July 24 edition of the San Francisco Chronicle it is said that Air Force investigators dived into a steep dive causing the damaging vibration. "Earlier theories had the plane under attack from above by everything from a meteor to a flying saucer." A San Francisco official said a series of tests revealed and pinned down the cause of the plane's elevator servo-tab. The servo-tab is a small control surface which serves a larger movable control. It is a sort of trim tab which helps the pilot keep the plane in proper trim. When the servo-tab slipped up, said Smith, "The elevator was just pitched up (the pilot) over." Smith said, "Guess it would feel like he had been hit in the back with a brick."

J. & H. Mercer, Danville, C.I.S. C.H. Marsh, Jr., Denver, Colo.; George Clark, St. Louis, Park; A. Gould, Oakland, Calif.; H. Hubbard, Phoenix, Ariz.; H. G. Roemer, Phila, Pa.

Continued the Chronicle: The plane recovered so sharply from the dive that the pilot blacked out. During the recovery from the dive, it was necessary to make a quick pull-up than normal, the Air Force said. The pull-up was made with such force that it allowed little limit on the aircraft. The stress of the pull-up was so great that the elevator was for five feet long.

Case 173, San Joaquin Valley, Cal., July 22, '56—Said the Los Angeles Evening Herald Express: "Authorities stated a 'flying saucer' short report of two mysterious flying objects over San Joaquin Valley. Investigators failed to find any trace of the craft which a woman near Fresno described as an oval object emitting a greenish light from its tail. A Tulare county resident said he saw a similar jet-like craft crash near Pixley. Both incidents took place about 8:30 am, a little more than five hours before the 'collision'."

Case 176, Sierra region, Cal. July 22, '56—Also pertinent is another report written in to CIRO by Miss Jane Purcell of Fresno. She writes, in part, ". . . A friend Miss Lenore Oker, and I were camping out at Lake Murr, a spot of 5000 feet altitude in the Mammoth Lakes Region in the High Sierra country. At approximately 5:45 the next morning (July 22) Miss Oker, unable to sleep, was looking at the sky . . . In the northwest sky she saw a ball of light followed by a short pointed tail. The colors were and were similar to those of a bunsen burner and were arranged in the following manner: first the blue ball, which faded into green, then yellow, green, then yellow, then orange and lastly diminishing into a trail of sparks—the whole racing the shape of a cone with the axis in a roughly horizontal position. . . . It was in view for about 3 or 4 seconds traveling from east to west..."

Case 190, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio 10:15 p.m., July 24, 1956 - Sighter Paul Hanson with "Object first sighted about 20 degrees up in NW sky. It moved directly not overhead then directly into the moon from which it disappeared again. Speed was constant. To naked eye the object was bluish-white. Through 7 power glasses it had a definite orange color. Brightness comparable to the sky on the same course as the unknown plane traversed lost in the full moon but it emerged below the moon and disappeared on the horizon. To the naked eye the jet was blue-white, the same as the unknown but in contrast to the unknown it was also blue-white through the glasses."

Case 191, Provo, Utah, July 25, 1956-We quote from the Desert News and Telegraph: "Reports of a 'strange streak of light and a flare-up' at the crest of Mt. Timpanogos touched off aerial and ground searches. CAP searches could find no trace of any crashed plane. No aircraft were reported missing. It was presumed the nocturnal fireworks were caused by a meteor. Search craft returned with reports of a fresh rock-slide near the north end of the mountain. The CAP sent into the plane into the air in an effort to trace reports from three residents of American Fork who saw a streak of light followed by a 'flare-up.' The flare appeared to be over the crest of the mountain on the east side from American Fork. They said the fire lit the sky at the top of the mountain. One said it appeared to be a meteor which struck and the thousand-acre Capt. Very Collins of the struck said the search found no traces of the flaming object."

Case 179, Brentwood, Cal., July 28, 1956—The Oakland Tribune reported that a three hour search failed to solve the mystery of a "sparkling green light" which appeared to land in an orchard. Six residents and an Oakland visitor reported to the sheriff's deputy that at 9:55 p.m. Saturday they saw a "green flash going through the sky and then fell or land in the orchard." Television reception was reported temporarily interrupted at that approximate time. Four sheriff's deputies and several reserve officers searched a square mile area at the "landing spot" but found nothing. Officials at Oakland Airport and Hamilton and Travis AFBs said they knew of no planes in the Brentwood sky at the time.

Case 178, between Port Austin and Bad Axe, Mich., July 30, 1956—We quote from The Saginaw News, in part: Huron County Deputy Sheriff Fred Czernus and William Gravlin, announcer of station WLEW, Bad Axe, reported seeing a luminous object about 500 ft. in the air, traveling very fast. Both men, traveling together, said the object was visible for about 10 to 15 seconds. Czernus said later that the Sheriff's office had received two reports of other strange lights at 9:05 and 9:35 p.m., moving in a southerly direction. Farley reports were received of a large, rapidly moving colored light spotted in Saginaw. Midland and Clare Counties. The Port CRC reported the light shortly after midnight. The object was described as red, white and blue, moving rapidly. A State Police trooper said the light was too large and moved too fast to be an airplane. Air Force F-89's flew to the area to search at 1:53 a.m. but did not report finding any objects.

Review and Analysis - UFO Photo

15 Feb 57
434/Capt G.T. Gregory/wma
69215

Request your review and analysis of attached photograph and copy of report.

A microscopic examination discloses that the photo is not "doctored", and primarily not an emulsion flaw.

The absence of any horizon, objects or perspective for contrast or comparison makes analysis somewhat difficult. In the opinion of the office, and based upon numerous still and motion pictures of guided missile launchings, the trails shown here appear to be similar to those left in the wake of missiles.

The zig-zags, overlapping lines are those generally formed by the variable wind currents by missiles in their trajectory at various altitudes. The pattern of these lines is not characteristic of lightning flashes, ruling out such phenomenon.

Information available to this office indicates that the closest missile launching site to observer's location is White Sands, New Mexico, a distance approximately 300 miles from Amarillo, Texas.

Attached report indicates that the observer was facing in an almost directly opposite direction from White Sands, and the sharpness of the trail leads one to believe that it was much closer to observer.

Therefore, on the basis of the above, the following are submitted for consideration:

a. 4D-3 (1) Whether the missile assumption is valid.
(2) Whether there are (or were) any missile sites or operations in the general direction or vicinity reported.
(3) Any knowledge of missile firing, which missile firing is known to have departed from its designated course, within the particular time period given, which might explain the phenomenon.

b. 4D-2a (1) Specific comments as to the cause or identity of object in photograph.
(2) Estimated distance of the trail (assuming missile hypothesis, using characteristics of camera equipment used).

LIFE, in its July 30 issue, published a photograph of a bright, saucer-like object seen flying in the sky over southeastern Kansas the week before. "Air Force officials dismissed it as a reflection from burning natural gas, but the Kansans refused to accept this simple explanation for such a puzzling phenomenon."

2. However, the following should be made a matter of note:

a. Numerous alleged UFO sightings are reported directly to or are collected exclusively by unofficial UFO groups. The majority have periodic publications, usually a monthly paper, which describe the sightings with occasional lack of restraint.

b. Many UFO sightings are reported only to newspapers. Where such sightings are reported to small-town newspapers, they never reach the attention of the Air Force, directly or indirectly. As a matter of policy, the Air Force cannot consider cases not officially brought to its attention. Cost of investigating the countless rumors would be prohibitive.

c. Weeks or months later, when conclusive studies or "on the spot" investigations are no longer possible, the Air Force is often queried regarding the status or explanation of the incidents.
