PART II  Comments and Analysis

A.  Analysis

1.  Additional Factor.
    a. The two fighter aircraft sighted by Capt Stubbs and his crew have not been
    identified.

    b. "...AMC interceptors from Syracuse, N.Y. (138th Fighter Interceptor Sqdn)
    flying at 20,000 sighted an object that was bright, stationary, and bright. This
    report was made to Nite Cap at approximately 20002 or 1500B. Upon query, no further
    information was available.

    c. CGI sites near the area of the sighting reported no unidentified objects
    at that time. Mather, Nite Cap and Kee Nee were queried.

    d. Weather balloons are released from the following stations at 0100, 0700,
    1300, and 1900B, Buffalo, Albany, N.Y., Massena, Ontario.

2.  Comments as to cause of identity of object.
    a. From the evidence presented, the object sighted by Capt Stubbs' crew and
    the Pilot of aircraft from Syracuse could have been a balloon. Its size, shape,
    color, altitude and the time it was sighted all support this conclusion in addition
    to the fact that no known radar contact was made. The fact that this object was
    clearly visible to Capt Stubbs' crew for al long as 20 minutes does not support the
    balloon conclusion.

3.  Statement supporting comment and analysis.

NOTE: THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS INFORMATION AFFECTING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ESPIONAGE ACT, 50 U.S.C.,
    31 AND 32. AS AMENDED. ITS TRANSMISSION OR THE REVELATION OF ITS CONTENTS IN ANY MANNER TO AN UNAUTHORIZED PERSON IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

From: Intelligence Division
388th Bomb Wing (H)/SAC

Report No. 380 DNI-2-58
Page 4 of 7 Pages

a. In the opinion of this officer the object in question could have been a balloon. Normally a preliminary or some exceptional low altitude sighting. A very high altitude and good VFR conditions might explain why it was visible for such a duration.

Nevertheless, the opinion of an experienced B-47 crew must be respected and this crew does not believe object was a balloon.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:

1. The reporting crew is a Combat-Ready B-47 crew. As such, its reporting reliability is considered to be above average. I concur with the comments of the reporting officer, except that a relatively large balloon on an extremely high altitude, may have been/visible under circumstances as described.

DATE: May 20, 1958

FROM: Weather Bureau Airport Station
Air Mail Field
Buffalo, New York

SUBJECT: Balloons Released at Approximately 1430EST 19 April 1958

Reference: AFCIN-484 19 April 58 Syracuse case
Your Dispatch dated May 14, 1958

A check of our records indicates that our only balloon released about this time was a small 100-gram pilot balloon sent off about 1300EST from Niagara Falls, N. Y. which probably broke within an hour thereafter. Other possibilities are:

1. Pilot balloon released from our Syracuse or Albany, N. Y. weather stations at about 1300EST.

2. Large radiosonde balloons are released from Canadian weather stations such as Toronto and Ottawa, etc. You might contact the Canadian weather service on these. Possibly even some radar wind target devices are released by some of their stations.

19 April 1958
Conway, New Hampshire near Syracuse, New York

On 19 April the crew of a B-47 observed a round, silver object in the sky above them. The altitude of the B-47 was 32,000 and excellent VFR conditions existed. The observation took place between Syracuse, New York and about twenty miles southwest of Plattsburgh AFB, New York. At first, all crew members thought object to be a balloon, but object did not disappear as rapidly as expected. The object was clearly visible for twenty minutes.

Enlargement of the photo showed a perfectly round, transparent like object similar to plastic balloons. U.S. Weather bureau and Navy charts showed a high altitude balloon in the area.

SUBJECT: UFO Report and Colored Slide, Submitted 9 June 1958

TO: Commander
    11th Filter Group (Air Defense - ADC)
    Ethan Allen Air Force Base
    Winooski, Vermont

1. Reference subject report and a 35mm slide submitted to this Center for analysis and conclusions. The slide was of poor quality. Report is transmit for Air Force use only.

2. Both a microscopic and a macroscopic examination of the slide will a number of variablemenial characteristics of the transparency reveals only developing flaws, i.e., long scratches apparently from an over tight transporting mechanism in base material in the well known round, transparent, paper-wrapping object similar to current plastic balloons.

3. In coordination with the U. S. Air Force Weather Service, it was determined by a study of scaled balloon track charts that on 13 April 1958, was in the general location reported at the times given. Reference: G-4-M (Special) Weather Plotting Chart, Headquarters, Air Attach activities, Littlr Balloons activities, Group, dated 21 April 1958.

4. This balloon over 150 ft in diameter, was tracked last to East across the United States by both the AASC and FCC, and has reported toward the Northeast border of Maine.

5. In view of the fact that the description and characteristics of the subject given by source is that of a typical balloon, it is revealed shortly, that the object was a balloon. It is therefore the conclusion of this Center that the object was balloon No. 5-7/3.

This appears to be a map with a grid overlay. Most of the text on the map is too faint or illegible to read clearly. The image shows what seems to be a map of a geographical region, with latitude and longitude lines forming a grid pattern. The map appears to be in black and white, with very light markings and boundaries of what might be land masses or regions.

This image appears to be a map of Canada and the northern part of North America. It is a grid-based map with latitude and longitude lines, showing the outline of Canada's provinces, territories, and coastlines. The map is in black and white and appears to be a technical or navigational chart. No text is legible beyond the grid numbers and coordinates.

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Dept. of the Interior
Civil Aeronautics Administration, and the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The chart shows various cities and locations, with numerous intersecting lines, elevation markers, and grid coordinates. Cities like Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Lebanon, and others are visible on the map. The map appears to cover a significant portion of the northeastern United States.

This appears to be a complex map with numerous lines, intersections, and location names. At the bottom of the map, there is a scale and some text that appears to be a citation or attribution, but the text is too small and blurry to read clearly. The map seems to cover a large geographic area with many interconnected lines and grid-like patterns. However, as an OCR system, I cannot confidently transcribe the specific text on the map due to its complexity and low resolution.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

WARNING AREA

The rest of the document appears to be a map with various grid lines, coordinates, and location markers. Some location names I can make out include:
- Nantucket
- Nantucket Islands
- Nantucket Shoals
- Control Area 114

The map seems to cover an area of ocean/coastal regions with latitude and longitude markings.


- page 32 -

The text on this page reads:

At the top right, partially cut off, it appears to say "ELEVATIONS IN FT"

The map shows various locations, cities, and geographical features around the Hudson River area, with numerous lines, coordinates, and elevation markers. Some visible place names include:

- Canada
- U.S.
- Eastern Cadiz
- Portland
- Syracuse
- Hamilton
- Binghamton

There is also a "DANGER AREA" marked on the map near the Canada/U.S. border.

The map appears to be a detailed topographical or navigational chart of the Hudson River region.
