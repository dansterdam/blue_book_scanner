Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft, Sioux City, Iowa
1951                 INDORSEMENT                 23 Jan 51             1

1. Reference is made to teletype no. 13 OSI 27, dated 22 Jan 51, from OENUTX AC3, Omaha, Neb, giving root details of subject sighting.

2. The subject sighting can be classed as confirmed information since two Tower Controllers "saw" the object. The object at 0250 in the evening and 0300 local of the commercial transport observed the object at 8:25. Also, a "shake-off" maneuver performed by the transport airplane was stated to be "in coordination with tower operations."

3. The general trend of the reported sighting is similar to previous sightings which have been in the Sioux City area. However, the teletype states that "weather conditions were clear" and that the observations were made "in bright moonlight." The pilot of the transport airplane then continues to give a fairly detailed description of the object and being distinctly atypical with an unusual configuration, large size, and above-normal performance ability.

4. On the basis of the above analysis, the object appears to have been an aircraft, the description of which does not agree with any known types. The detail of the description and the reported credibility of the witnesses do not indicate that the report could be easily discredited.

5. The expected final conclusions are difficult to state at this time. Further revelations might be brought out by a check of aircraft in the vicinity or a check of the "noted light between red and orange in color," or by the additional data being forwarded. The mention of "lights similar to running lights" being blinked as though manually seems to indicate a vicinity aircraft and the "bright light similar to landing lights" would seem to indicate a very light.

6. Action has been taken to have the CSI-50 forwarded the additional data as soon as received. A balloon is being sent to AGI informing them of the sighting and requesting if they have any additional information. It is considered that no additional action should be taken on the subject sighting until the additional data is received from CSI.

7. The responsibilities of the Air Defense Command in connection with visitations of this kind should be more firmly established than currently appears to be the case.

Controlling, 1st Lt. [redacted] on 28 January 1951 at 2020 hours, 1st. [redacted] controller, CAA tower, Sioux City Municipal Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, were interviewed and they both stated substantially as follows:

At approximately 2020 hours, this date, they observed a very bright light west of the field on a approximate heading of 210 degrees to 230 degrees from the airport. The light was approximately 200 to 3000 feet, at a distance of 10 to 15 miles, almost over the Iowa radio tower at Sioux City, Nebraska. This light was very bright and appeared to be a very definitely 1 to 2 miles. [redacted] attempted to view the light toward field glasses, but could not distinguish any shape or form associated with the light. The navigational lights, both red and green, were visible, and the Captain of the ship was advised of the light, also requested to keep a lookout for it on the tower did not know what it was. [redacted] then checked with [redacted] (1st. [redacted] 2nd Class), and the object moved from a hovering position, just continued, to a position off the field, and at an altitude of about 4000 to 5000 feet, then continued on a northwesterly heading. The controller's flight by leaving the tower at 2017 hours (CST), and continued a climbing turn to the west. While in this vicinity the Captain of Flight 5 reported that he was very bright object. The control tower advised that the object had moved from its original position to a position of the field, and west 5000 feet, above the ground at 1500 feet. The Captain reported that he had the object in sight, and that it appeared to be a very large military aircraft, supposed in the lower left quadrant of his view. At this time, he was in a left turn. The tower advised the Captain that there were none that they had been advised of. Flight 5 continued in a turning attitude and climbing. Then approached and landed at Sioux City. The Captain obtained a light formation with his ship. At this position the tower lost sight of the object. From this point to continue in a northwesterly direction with a cross azimuth, from 1st. 140, approximate time was 2033 hours (CST). At 2041 hours the Captain of Flight 5 advised the tower that he was approaching the field from the west on a 10 heading, and that he was now able to see his tail. The tower saw the object, and Flight 5 continued on course the field, the object remaining in a position just off the field, as a cautional altitude of 2000 feet, 1 to 2 miles away. Flight 5 started a right turn just prior to reaching.

Title: An Airline Captain Reports: Another Saucer Mystery

By Lawrence W. Vintlee

At the top left of the page is a header from "The Office of Naval Research" which appears to discuss cosmic ray balloons or something similar, though the text is partially illegible.

There are two small head and shoulder photographs of what appear to be men in the top left corner of the document.

The main text begins with "I WAS..." but the rest of the text is too illegible to confidently transcribe. The document appears to be a report about a UFO or "flying saucer" sighting by an airline captain.

On the right side of the page are additional clippings or sections of text, but they are also largely illegible due to the image quality.

The document has three hole punches visible on the left side of the page.

a southeasterly direction at an angle of 40 degrees from the horizon. As their airplane left the ground, call in coordination with the tower operators, they sighted the white light or an object in a bank 15 degrees toward the object circled with them at a distance estimated at four miles and with an estimated speed of 4 to 5 knots. Keeping constant a check of their plane was a white light at 11 miles per hour. As their plane continued circling toward an easterly direction, the object placed itself which appeared like normal running lights on a plane. The blinking appeared as if there were actually two lights. Then the object reached a point due east of their plane, which was then headed east, there appeared a single but at light similar to a landing light. Then was a single, then a long light, and then a circular toward the north the object suddenly made a sharp 50 degree turn and descended at times, crossing in front and above their plane, and took up a position on their left approximately 1500 feet away, hovering in the same direction and at the same speed. The object remained in this position approximately two or three seconds and then disappeared later. Their plane at this time was approximately 1000 feet altitude. Mr. WINTER stated that the object was well below the plane and was flying with them. They could not measure their plane no as to observe the object again, and shortly thereafter continued their measured altitude observation. The location of the object was estimated to be about 20 miles east of Sioux City.

1. Then the object made its descent on their plane and took its position on their left. Mr. WINTER stated it appeared to be an large as a 2-3 to one and would rise of it a body. The fuselage appeared to be of clear shaped and the wing was black, somewhat well forward on the fuselage, and the only wing details across and gave the appearance of a cigar that had been flattened. The wing was described as somewhat curved and to have an unsteady, and there were no major details visible. The wing was the appearance of a blacker wing. To again trace visible when the object was along side their ship, and no form or objects could be seen at the object. Mr. WINTER stated he did not observe any rudder or stabilizers in the view of the object's damage.

2. All during the observation of the object the weather conditions were described as a clear and high.

3. Mr. WINTER stated he observed no evidence of any scanning could not confirm the object's speed of movement, nor position other than the engine of their own plane; and received no interference on their radio at any time while talking with the tower even when the object was in their immediate vicinity.

4. Mr. WINTER stated the object appeared to always be their position and would move, very fast, very abrupt, with a speed down to the climbing speed of their plane which was 120 MPH. The object did not flutter or oscillate, and it maintained a steady position at all.

UNCLASSIFIED

Kansas City, Missouri
23 January 1951

On 20 January 1951, at 2225 hours, I was piloting a B-50 Continental Bomber aircraft and was taking off in a north west direction at the Sioux City, Iowa Airport escorted by [redacted], Co-pilot, when our attention was called by the control tower operator, to an object in the sky. So the west of plains. The object appeared to be between 4 and 5 miles an orange light and I would estimate that it was approximately 4 miles away at an altitude of approximately 8,000 feet, at a 45 degree angle.

As our plane left the ground, and at the request of the control tower operator, we started our climb and circled in a counter clock wise direction. Our ascent during this climb was gradual and we were moving in a wide arc around us going in the same direction. When the object was reached a point southeast of our plane, it blinked more lights which appeared like normal running lights and a pulsating white light. The 15 years manual control then the object reached a point due east of the direction that our plane was headed, there appeared a single but not light similar to a blinking light which was white and so as to give a sensation of something unusual. The object suddenly made a sharp 90 degree turn and headed toward our plane at a terrific speed, crossing over and in front of our plane. The next thing I knew, the object was on our left, turning its nose directly south. From the 125 degree wing and at the same speed. The object remained in this position approximately two or three seconds and then disappeared below our plane and was not seen again. The forward speed was following just below our plane but we could not maneuver our plane so as to observe it again, and continued on our scheduled flight to Cannon.

The object appeared to be as large as a B-29 to one and one half times the size of a B-29. The fuselage appeared to be of clear shape and the wing was about normal and clearly visible. The object was straight across. The wing was mounted from mid to high on the fuselage and looked like a slender wing. There were no windows visible. I did not observe any exhaust; could not determine its means of propulsion; heard no noise other than our own planes exhaust; and received no interference on our radio.

The object appeared to always be under perfect control, and moved at will, varying in speed from very high speed down to the climbing speed of our plane.

[Several lines are blacked out]

We were the crew departing Kansas City on old schedule. Flight 76 at 0750 January 20. We terminal the Minneapolis to Kansas City leg after stops at Des Moines, Waterloo, and Rochester. We arrived at home base due to head winds.

Other than that the flight was normal.

We departed Minneapolis on schedule at 1525. After a four hour rest during which time I visited my mother and some friends of the family in St. Paul, Eugene on Ft 19 we made scheduled stops at [blacked out] afternoon, Huron, Sioux Falls and Sioux City. We were scheduled to land at Sioux City, the tower operator advised us of an object he had sighted west of the field and asked us to investigate. We took off

Page 2 of 4 pages

and immediately spotted the object west of the field at an estimated altitude of 8000' and about three miles distant. The object's path of flight was in an arc from a position west of the field through a position northeast and made a turn inside the object to the left until he was directly close of the on an easterly heading at an estimated altitude of 5000' and about two miles ahead of us. At this point we kept climbing at an indicated airspeed of 120 IAS.

Just before getting his in a position directly above us we noticed three blinking lights (red, green, white) that outlined about 6 times and appeared to have been parallel mainly. Then as the object was directly ahead of us we noticed a white, bright light

Page 3 of 4 pages

similar in intensity to one of our landing lights. This light lasted only a couple of seconds, but seemed to be coming from where I could judge to be the side of the fuselage; although at the distance he was from us that would be hard to ascertain.

Up until this point I would judge the speed of the object to be somewhere between 450 and 500 MPH.

Then at this point, when the object was ahead of us about two miles and about 1000' above, it seemed to make a 90° turn to the right and then come directly at us at a terrific speed, which I would try to estimate, and evidently take in a collision about 200' to the left of us and very wide as our speed for a few seconds. It seemed to have a clear whole fuselage about the length of a 329 and a straight wing almost as long, mounted slightly

I, [redacted], Airport Traffic Controller and [redacted], assistant Airport Traffic Controller were on duty at the Sioux City Air Force Traffic Control Tower at Sioux City Municipal Airport, Sergeant Bluff, Iowa from 16005 to 21609 February 23, 1951 and observed the following:

At approximately 20620 a bright light was observed from the control tower. When first noticed it appeared to be approximately 2,000 feet above the surface on a bearing of approximately 250° from the tower and about 2½ to 3 miles away. This light appeared to be stationary and of extreme brilliance for a period of one to two minutes. Then gradually began to fade. At this time [redacted] Flight Nine was already taxiing instructions for takeoff and was then advised of the light the tower had in sight. The pilot was unable to locate the light which had been to a wall. Pilot and crew positively identified the light as approximately eight or nine thousand feet and a distance of about four miles the light appeared to become stationary again somewhat off the airport. (Mid-Continent Airline Flight 9 took off northwest at 20:25 and a left turn was made to the light's position. Within a few seconds the Mid-Continent Pilot sighted the object. The pilot then turned to a northerly heading and advised the tower they observed the object. The pilot further stated the object was a very large whitish light. No jet aircraft or other day jet aircraft in the vicinity. At this time ABOBO, a Cessna model 140 pilot had been taxiing and was making a runway check at Sioux City. The Cessna was immediately given taxi instructions and landed at 20:30. Also, at approximately the same time at 20:37, a Beechcraft Bonanza called for a landing instruction and landed at 20:35. A Mid-Continent Airlines Flight Line advised the object was flying a loose formation with his. Mid-Continent Airlines Flight Nine was at an approximate altitude of 3500 feet at northwest heading about one mile northwest of the airport. The pilot could not be observed from the tower.

Mid-Continent Airlines Flight Nine then took up a northwest heading circling directly over the tower, advised the object was still clearly on their 6 o'clock. At approximately 20:40 the object was observed apparently following Mid-Continent Airlines Flight Nine just before Flight Nine passed over the tower. The pilot then again asked the tower the position of the object. The tower advised the object was in sight about a mile and a half due east of the tower at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the ground apparently in a stationary position. The object then began to move at a rate of speed in a northwesterly direction. The pilot of Flight Nine again ask the position of the object and the direction it was traveling. The tower advised that the object was approximately half way between Mid-Continent Airline Field and that the object was apparently moving very rapidly in a northeasterly direction. Mid-Continent Airlines Flight Nine then proceeded on course to Omaha, Nebraska at approximately 20:50. The object was last sighted from the tower at 20:50 heading in a northeasterly direction.

The foregoing statement is true and correct to the best of our knowledge.

Sight Strange Aircraft
Over Sioux City; It Does
Tricks New to Pilots

Strange Aircraft
Sighted In Sky
By Two Flyers

KANSAS CITY, Mo. Jan. 22—
(UP)—A veteran airline pilot said today
he saw a strange, monster aircraft in a moonlit Iowa sky above
Sioux City, Iowa, and described it
as having no visible means of
propulsion.

"I'd say it was as large or half again as large as a B-29," pilot
Harry W. Vinther, 32, Kansas
City, Kan., said. "It did things
to do."

The mystery plane was observed
also by Vinther's first officer,
James F. Bachmeier, also of Kansas City, Kan., shortly after takeoff in a Mid-Continent Airlines
DC-3 Saturday night.

Vinther said the plane had a
slightly wing "and no tail assembly to speak of."

Bachmeier said the aircraft was
like a cigar and its wing tip flattened near a head-on pass and
a maneuver which immediately
followed that most astonished
both Vinther and Bachmeier.

Vinther said the strange craft
had turned my head to watch him
pass, there he was again flying
some 200 feet by our side—and
going in the same direction as
we were.

"You can't turn ordinary airplanes that fast," he said.

Airline Flier Describes
Amazing Performance
by Huge Ship

KANSAS CITY—(JP)—A veteran
airline pilot Sunday night told of
seeing a strange aircraft Saturday
night that did something "you just
can't do with airplanes today."

Larry W. Vinther of Kansas City, Mid-Continent airline pilot who has been flying
17 years and has been with
Mid-Continent seven years, said
the incident occurred over Sioux
City.

He described the strange
plane as about "one and a half
times the size of a B-29, with
a long, slender fuselage, long
straight wings set farther forward than a B-29."

"There were no engine mountings on the wings and I saw all
bombers, and there were no jet
poppies visible."

Vinther said the craft was seen
by his copilot, James F. Bachmeier
of Kansas City and one of the 11
passengers aboard.

"As I was getting tower clearance to take off from the Sioux
City field at 8:20 o'clock," Vinther
said, "the tower asked us to check
on the strange light in the sky."

"We spotted the North star
climbed in that direction. We
saw the plane had some sort
of navigation lights. In addition to a strong white light
underneath the fuselage. The
lights all blinked off and on
five or six times as we drew
nearer."

Vinther said his DC-3 was doing 120 miles an hour and the
other craft was going faster than
that in the opposite direction.

"I had just turned my head
from watching him go past our
wing when there he was again,
flying right beside us about 200
feet to our left, going in the same
direction."

Winther said his DC-3 was doing 120 miles an hour and the other craft was going faster than that in the opposite direction.

"I had just turned my head from watching him go past our wing when there he was again, flying right beside us about 200 feet to our left, going in the same direction we were," he said.

Winther said that's what mystified him because "you just can't turn an airplane around that fast at that speed."

The strange plane flew alongside about four seconds then eased off below the DC-3 "and we lost him," the pilot said.

Winther "flashed over" overnight at Omaha. He said he checked the airbase at Offutt field there and learned there were no airforce jet planes scheduled in that area.

Attempts to learn further details concerning the strange aircraft reported over Sioux City were unavailing here Sunday night. Mid-Continental airlines official said that as far as he knew no one at the municipal airport at Sergeant Bluff had seen the aircraft. Other sources, however, declined comment.

Bachmeier said the aircraft was "shaped like a cigar and its wings were straight, not swept back like the B-47 and other jet bombers, and there were no jet pods visible."

Linther said the craft was seen by his copilot, James F. Bachmeier of Kansas City and one of the 11 passengers aboard.

"As I was getting tower clearance to take off from the Sioux City field at 8:26 o'clock," Winther said, "the tower asked us to check on the strange light in the sky."

"We spotted the light and climbed in that direction. We saw the plane had some sort of navigation lights. In addition to a strong white light underneath the fuselage. The lights all blinked off and on five or six times as we drew nearer."

Startling Performance
of Strange Plane Over
City Related by Fliers
Airline Pilot, Air
Guard Captain Tell
of Amazing Speed

Reports grew Monday of an
amazing performance by a strange
aircraft over Sioux City.

Larry D. Vinther of Kansas
City, a veteran airline pilot, told
of seeing a plane just can't do
what this aircraft did. He gave
an account of how the plane flew
in the opposite direction, then in
an incredible short time passed
him, again going in the same di-
rection.

Monday Capt. Richard
Baugh of the 174th fighter
squadron of the air national
guard, discussed he had a
similar experience a month
or so ago.

Capt. Baugh, like Vinther, was

impressed by the bright light on
the tail of the fuselage of the
strange plane and its speed.

"It had more speed than any-
thing I ever saw before," Capt.
Baugh said Monday at Vermil-
lion, S. D., where he is a senior
journalist at the University
of South Dakota. His home is here
at 2300 Douglas street.

Chase Fails
Capt. Baugh, who at the time

was up in a TC-3, said that he
attempted to chase the mysterious plane, but it circled and out-
climbed him. He said the plane
appeared to be northwest of
Sioux City and said that most
of his experience was so dark
he could not describe the plane
other than its bright light.

back like on the 11-17 and other jet
bombers, and there were no jet
pods visible."

Vinther said the craft was seen
by his copilot, James F. Bachmeier
of Kansas City and one of the 11
passengers aboard.

"As I was getting tower clearance to take off from the Sioux
City field at 5:26 o'clock," Vinther
said, "I saw a strange light in the
sky."

"We spotted the light and
climbed in that direction. We
saw the plane had some sort
of navigation lights, in addition to a strong white light
underneath the fuselage. The
lights all blinked off and on
five or six times as we drew
nearer."

Vinther said his DC-3 was doing 120 miles an hour and the
other craft was going in opposite
direction. "I had no point of
contact with the plane other than
from watching him go past our
wing when the plane was again
flying right beside us about 200
feet to our left, going in the same
direction we were," he said.

Vinther said that's what
mystified him because "you
just can't turn an airplane
around that fast as that
speed."

The strange plane flew alongside about four seconds then
went off below the DC-3 "and
we lost him," the pilot said.
Vinther's flight stayed overnight at Omaha. He said he
checked the airbase at Offutt field
there and learned there were no
airforce jet planes scheduled in
that area.

of Mid-Continent airlines, Vinther's employee, said that he had
been unable to learn any more
details. However, he said that
James Vanney, 1100 S. Glass
street, had notified him of seeing
a plane with particularly bright
lights at the same time as Vinther.

Gives Description
Vinther has been flying 17

years, seven with Mid-Continent.
The Associated Press said that
Vinther described the plane as
about 'one and a half times the
size of a B-29, with a long, slender fuselage, long straight wings
further forward than a
B-29.'

"There were no engine mountings on the wing and I saw no
exhaust coming from the plane,"

KANSAS CITY STAR    22 JANUARY 1951

A Strange Aircraft Is Seen Over Sioux City by Kansas City Pilot

Facts Which Cannot Be Performed by the Airplanes of Today Were Executed by the Mysterious Ship, Veteran Vinter Says.

A VETERAN air line pilot to check on the strange light in the sky last night told of seeing a strange aircraft Saturday night that did something "you just can't do with airplanes of today!"

Larry W. Vinther, 6028 Buena Vista, Johnson County, Mid-Continent Airline pilot who has been flying seventeen years and was with Mid-Continent seven years, said the aircraft he described was about the size of a B-29, with a long, slender fuselage, long straight wings set farther forward than a B-29's.

No Exhaust Glow.

"There were no engine mountings on the wings and it saw no exhaust glow," Vinther said.

"The wings were straight, not swept back like on the B-47, and other jet bombers, and there were no jet pods visible."

Vinther said the craft was seen by his co-pilot, James F. Bachmeier, 2608 Parkwood boulevard, Kansas City, Kansas, and one of the eleven passengers aboard.

"As I was getting lower clear of the Sioux City field at 8:26 o'clock," Vinther said, "the tower asked us to check the strange light and climbed off and on five or six times as we drew nearer."

Other Craft Traveling Fast.

Vinther said his DC3 was doing 120 miles an hour and the other craft was going faster than that in the opposite direction.

"I had just turned my head from watching him go past our wing when there he was again, flying right beside us about 200 feet to our left, going in the same direction we were," he said.

Vinther said that's what mystified him because you just can't turn an airplane around that fast.

The strange plane came a few along-side a few seconds, then eased off below the DC3 and we lost him, the pilot said.

Vinther's flight stayed overnight at Omaha. He said he checked the air base at Offutt Field there, and learned there were no air force jet planes scheduled in that area.

was held above.

That formed the object clear to view

was not too critical. The object was
light night so we got an excellent silhou-

The light was further for the
object to be seen. It could be seen
from a great height. The object was
