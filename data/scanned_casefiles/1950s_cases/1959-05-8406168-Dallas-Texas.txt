Dear Sirs,

I am writing you to report an observation made on the night of May 27, 1959 at 9:3 o'clock. I was out in my own yard. On this night at 9:3 o'clock at 9:3 o.M. it was about 10 or 15 degrees high. I saw four-high, and it was about low-including and it might have been a reflection on the glass but it might be reflection. We don't they were still at rest. We seemed to be going on a fantastic ride of speed. I will not give my guess at what speed they were going. It would be fantastic. They seemed to be moving in a steady way. It was a steady to west in a wing and I formation of 4 or 5. At 9:15 p.m. the light of white was moving in a summit and with. I will send my 11:30 a good and a long report at 11:30 about the facts.
