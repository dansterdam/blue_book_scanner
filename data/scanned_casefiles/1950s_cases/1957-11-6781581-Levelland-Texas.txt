ATC comment:
Conflicting signals here, but Venus now so bright that newspapers are commenting on it was at almost exact position (20° ele, 6° w) given in report here. Also since this is the place where the newspapers UFO case in years (4 Nov. 57) took place mass suggestion due to world news papers publicity given that case a few days ago cannot be ruled out.
