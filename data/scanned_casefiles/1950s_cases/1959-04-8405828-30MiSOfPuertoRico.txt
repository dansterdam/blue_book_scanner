Venus and Jupiter Prominent

An annular eclipse of the sun will occur early in April, a month that will have two planets prominent in the evening skies.

By JAMES STOKLEY

> SHINING FOR THREE hours after sunset, the planet Venus now dominates the western evening sky. More than 60 degrees above the horizon, it appears long before any other star or planet, so there is no doubt of its identity.

Hardly has Venus descended below the western horizon, before another planet, slightly less brilliant, rises in the southeast. This is Jupiter, a quarter as bright as Venus, and still ascending any star.

At the beginning of April Jupiter rises in the constellation Scorpius, the scorpion, a little more than an hour after Venus. On April 12 there is no interval between the setting of one and the rising of the other. The new actor appears on the celestial stage just as the old one is exiting. By the end of April it will be possible to see both in the sky at the same time.

Mars Receding

A third planet is also visible. This is Mars, still receding from the earth. At the middle of April its distance is about 161,000,000 miles, and because of this it has faded from its brilliance of a few months ago. In fact, it is just on the borderline between first and second magnitude.

The accompanying maps show the appearance of the skies about 10:00 p.m. your own kind of standard time, at the beginning of April, an hour earlier at the middle of the month and two hours earlier at the end. Venus is seen near the horizon, toward the northwest, in Taurus, the bull, and to the right of the bright star Aldebaran. Mars is in Hydra, or Gemini, the twins, in which there is the next-magnitude star called Pollux. Curiously, the most conspicuous star in this group, ranks only in the second magnitude. Jupiter does not show on the maps, but Scorpius, in which it stands, is just below Libra, the scales, which is shown near the southeastern horizon.

Directly west, and near the horizon, Orion, the hunter, which was so conspicuous in the south winter evenings, is seen in the early evening. Toward the east, in the great dog, is Sirius, the great dog star. Above this the bright star Capella is high in the south these evenings in Leo.

The first bright part of this group, which is supposed to form the animal's head and shoulder, is called the sickle. The first magnitude star Regulus is at the end of the handle. Deneb, one of these is Saturn, which is now in Sagittarius, the archer. It comes up about 1:00 a.m. at the first of April and about 11:00 p.m. at the end. Mercury is the other. On April 26 it will be farthest west of the sun, and will rise a little ahead of that body, becoming visible low in the east at dawn for a few days. This, however, will not be a very favorable time to see this planet.

April also brings an eclipse of the sun, the first of two this year, but this one will not be visible from the United States, or any part of North or South America. It will, however, be seen over a large area, including Australia and New Zealand, and much of the Indian Ocean and the southwestern Pacific.

Solar Eclipse Due

This is what is called an annular eclipse. Any eclipse of the sun occurs when the moon comes in front of it, and hides it more or less from view. But the distance of the moon varies each month, from perigee 222,050 to 252,960 miles. When farthest, it does not appear large enough to cover the sun's disc completely. Then, even though it may come precisely in front of the sun, a ring-shaped area of the solar surface can be seen around the black disc of the moon. This is called the annulus, from the Latin word for ring, and so we have the name annular eclipse.

From a ship in the Indian Ocean, at about 42 degrees south latitude, 72 degrees east longitude, just as the sun was rising.

Here is the text from the document:

in the east on April 9, the beginning of
an annular eclipse could be seen.

This path over which the ring may be
seen goes northwestward to Perth, Australia;
then traverses that continent to Cape Mel-
ville on the northeast coast; thence to the
Pacific Ocean, and Guadalcanal and San
Cristobal in the Solomon Islands. The path
comes to an end as the sun is setting, at
about ten degrees south and 168 degrees
west, which is in the southwestern Pacific
Ocean.

The eclipse will be at its maximum where
the path crosses northern Australia; there
the annulus will be visible for even min-
utes.

Over a much larger area, including the
rest of Australia, New Zealand, part of
Antarctica, Borneo, the Celebes and New
Guinea, there will be a partial eclipse.
In this region the moon will partially cover
the sun, with a larger portion hidden the
nearer the place is to the path of the
annular eclipse.

A curious feature of this eclipse is that
it ends the day before it starts!

This is because, in progressing from west
to east, it crosses the International Date
Line, at 180 degrees longitude, at a point
where the day changes to the next Indian
Ocean, as in Australia, it will be Wednes-
day, April 8. But after it crosses the Date
Line, which it does in the late afternoon,
it will be in a region of the earth where
it is still Tuesday, April 7.

Few Eclipse Observations

Although astronomers often travel long
distances to observe eclipses of the sun,
as they did last October to Dugger Island,
the April 9 annular eclipse was not likely
to make much effort to observe the Australian
eclipse.

Most of the observations made by eclip-
se parties require that the sun be com-
pletely covered. Even the narrow ring of
the solar disk left visible at an annular
eclipse presents such work. However, it
is likely that many amateur astronomers
will take advantage of the eclipse, if lo-
cated near the path of visibility, will take
advantage of their opportunity to see a
rare and interesting phenomenon, even
though it is of relatively little scientific
value.
