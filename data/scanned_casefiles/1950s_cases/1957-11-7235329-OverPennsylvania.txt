The September 4th
Pittsburgh that Walter
A. Feibelman, phone
graph, at 11:58 p.m.
observed an aerial phe-
nomenon very distinc-
tive, despite the interfe-
rence by clouds and
bright moonlight. Mr.
Feibelman stated that
maximum auroral in-
tensity occurred near
10:56 to 10:55 p.m.
Some of his pictures
showed a bright area in
the parallel rays very
thin and numerous. A

Center at Cornell University. He com-
pared his observations with the aurora
map and found good correlation.

A bright red glow appeared near the above
mentioned area.

James E. McDowell in his article on page 64, AEC

the zenith, some ex-
tending down to the southwest. Such

appearing almost blood red; in the north
sky, however, the forms were mainly

On the West Coast at Vancouver,
British Columbia, Terry Taylor watched
the peak of the September 22nd display at
4:50 p.m. Pacific standard time he
writes:

The corona had grown into a
spectacular red-and-white whirlpool of
light, with great vertical development.
Bright rays covered over 75 per cent of
the sky, nearly shuttering the Sun into
attitude stars in Cassiopeia. In the dense

COMET MRKOS AND SOLAR
ACTIVITY

Recent photographic and spectro-
scopic observations of Comet Mrkos
according to astronomers at various ob-
servatories show the presence of a re-
markable phenomenon.

These observations suggest that the
gases of the comet show streams of
high-energy electrons similar to those
responsible for the bright auroral dis-
plays during the recent solar activity.

Another reader of this magazine, in
R (Rockport), reports a similar sighting
at Greeley, Colorado, two months
later, about 3 a.m. Mountain standard
time, September 3rd. From the north-
ern quarter of the horizon, greenish-white
rays extended upward, with intermittent
flashing flashes that characterize a slow
moving aurora. A photograph of this scene
event, by A. J. Morehouse at Battle Creek,
Michigan, is shown on this page.

Both of these displays were classed by
the widespread auroral storm on the evening of September 4th, which was extremely brilliant despite the presence in
its full phase. This display is perhaps the
most spectacular auroral display of the past few decades. From as far south as
Batesville, Arkansas, J. R. Wright reports
"I first noticed the spectacle as a yellow
