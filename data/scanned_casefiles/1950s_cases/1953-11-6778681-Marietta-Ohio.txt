SIGHTED NEAR WOOD COUNTY AIRPORT, OHIO
SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO: Commander

ATTN: ATIAC-2C

1. The following is forwarded for your information:

On 20 November 1953, Marietta, Ohio, Telephone: [redacted] employed at [redacted] State Engineering Company, First National Bank, Marietta, Ohio, Telephone: [redacted] advised that at approximately 0330 hours, 20 November 1953, he, accompanied by his brother, 27 Southeast Seventh Street, Evansville, Indiana, and Street address unknown, Detroit, Michigan, were driving west on US Route Alternate 50, and at a point approximately ten (10) miles west of Marietta, fairly close to the Wood County Airport, when they noticed a luminous object, directly south of their position, moving slowly from east to west at approximately a 1500 foot lateral distance and an altitude of approximately eight (8) ten feet. Suddenly the object made approximately a thirty degree lateral angle southward and then accelerated rapidly out of sight.

All three (3) persons observed the object's flight, but because of its luminous surface and distance of observation, it was difficult to ascertain its shape or size. All were of the opinion that it was not a conventional aircraft.

[redacted] stated he had reported the incident to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Resident Agent, Marietta, Ohio, who advised that the United States Air Force was collecting information on "Flying saucers" and recommended that he contact the Office of Special Investigations.
