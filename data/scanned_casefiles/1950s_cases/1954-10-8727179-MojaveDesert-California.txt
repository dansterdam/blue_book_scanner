7 November 1954

Dear Sirs,

A few weeks ago I read in the papers here of an object that was sighted over an Ohio town left trailing that burned the hands of people from when those objects were touched. Perhaps you know of the incident to which I refer.

I had been rabbit hunting about five weeks ago on the edge of the Mojave desert with a friend of mine when we came across many tiny objects scattered about on top of the sand. They had a silvery color and could be crumbled in the hand. When crumbled, the things lost their silvery color and then appeared to resemble asbestos fiber. These objects covered a large area and were miles from a populated area. However these objects did not turn our hands green. Their average measurements were approximately 1" long with a diameter of 1/16 of an inch. I gave the matter no more thought until I read the recent occurrence on the Ohio sighting.

We were about 15 miles South West of Edwards AFB when we first noticed these things. These objects might be a new type of radar "chaff" from some experiment. Never the less, I am passing the info on to you. Is there anything that you think I might have left out?

My address is: S/Sgt
807th Operations Sqdn
March AFB, Calif

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]
