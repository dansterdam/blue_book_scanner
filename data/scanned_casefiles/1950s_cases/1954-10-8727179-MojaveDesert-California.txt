Text from the document:

7 November 1954

Dear Sirs,

A few weeks ago I read in the newspaper of an object that was sighted over an area that has since come to be known as the Mojave Desert. Perhaps you know of the incident to which I am referring.

I had been rabbit hunting about five weeks ago on the edge of the Mojave Desert with a companion when we came across many objects scattered about on top of the sand. They had a shiny color and silver color and then appeared to be colorful objects covered with a glittery material of some type that gave off a metallic luster. These objects were approximately 1 to 1 1/2 inches long with a diameter of 1/16 of an inch. I have no idea as to their nature.

We were about 15 miles south west of Edwards AFB when we first noticed these items. These objects do not appear to be any known type of radar reflector. If these are from some experiment by the Air Force that you think I might have left out, would you kindly advise me of the fact?

Sincerely,

[Redacted]
