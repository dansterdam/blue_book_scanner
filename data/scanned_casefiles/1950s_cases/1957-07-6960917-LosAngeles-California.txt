At approximately 2100 PDT, 22 July 1957 I received a phone call in Los Angeles International Airport, California from a very excited individual who stated that an unidentified flying object was over his home and that he was just north of L.A. I personally observed nothing.

At approximately 2130 PDT, the same individual called again and gave the same information. He verified his location and I started searching to the East. Suddenly I noticed a very bright flash of light. Immediately, the object was the telephone stated. There, did you see it explode? The object then disappeared.

The object was approximately 20 degrees above the horizon on a heading of approximately 85 degrees from L.A. Tower.

On the following evening, 22 July, I received another call from the individual stating that another object had just passed over L.A. International Airport heading Westward. I searched the entire area with negative results.

Well, we were out about 830 Sunday night, July 21, when all of a sudden I noticed a strange looking orange-red ball coming up in the East horizon. I told everyone about it, and we watched it for about 25 minutes. On until about 9:07 at which time they all saw (I did not see this) a big red explosion. At 9:45 P.M. the second (I am not sure) call came into the International Airport. It swooped down and exploded toward the East. In the first ball I saw, there was a strange trembling light.

There was no sound from the second explosion (I didn't see the light).

I had opened the back door to see when my husband was going to come in, when in the direction of the L.A. airport, I saw a circular object, the size of the moon.

It was orange in color, all of a once sudden it flew up (as in spontaneous combustion) and disappeared. This all took place at about seven minutes after nine.

On Sunday the 21st of July, 1957 I observed a flying object at approximately 9:15 that appeared to be floating across the sky traveling on the wind. The second object I saw came out of the West and burned with a big burst.

Both objects appeared to be traveling on wind currents. Both objects seemed to have the lights of Pires cause from one object and the lights swayed back and forth.

On July 21, 1957 at approx. 8:30 P.M. to 9:07 P.M. I observed an object in the sky at a distance I would say of 25,000 or 30,000 feet up. This object at first appeared to be moving very slowly, then fast, then it stopped, then suspended in air for at least 10 or 15 minutes. This object was yellowish orange in color. I watched it through binoculars until its disappearance at or near sight.

The other object I saw was just a ball of fire that lasted about 3 seconds. This object was about 600 to 1,000 feet high. There was no explosion and no fall-out.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. Los Angeles International Airport Control Tower was contacted.
Mr. Morton, Supervisor of the Control Tower advised that he initiated
the report of this unidentified flying object through Air Defense
Channels. He was not aware of the object until a telephone call
maintained by SOURCE at approximately 2030 PDT, 21 July 1957, SOURCE
called him and stated that he had tracked an object on the radar at
the airport. Mr. Morton took his binoculars and began searching that
area to no avail. He then searched East of the airport and saw a
flash of light approximately twenty (20) degrees above the horizon.
Reading was approximately twenty (20) degrees above the airport.
Total duration of the sighting was less than one (1) second. Immediately after this, SOURCE stated "There, did you hit something?"
(SOURCE maintained contact by telephone during the duration of the search
by the Area Supervisor). Two (2) other tower operators observed this
flash of light, although without the aid of binoculars. Mr. Morton
gave the following description of the object: at a time of the flash,
it was white in color, did not appear to have any sharply defined
edges, and was very round, and was approximately the size of
a baseball at arms length, without binoculars. The object disappeared
from view immediately after an apparent explosion. No other observations
were made. Reference page 5, PART ONE.

2. 27th Air Division (Defense), Norton AFB, (340WR-11706), California
was contacted and the following information was received:

    a. ACGW sites in the Los Angeles Area observed no unusual radar
    contact at the time of this sighting. Commanders of both sites pointed
    out that it is nearly impossible to monitor all traffic in the Los
    Angeles vicinity due to the shortage of air traffic.

    b. D/T, 27th Air Division (Defense) advised that he had received
    an information copy of a CAA notice that a series of balloon launching (numerous) would take place in the Yuma, Arizona area during
    the month of July 1957.

    c. Vincent AFB, Yuma, Arizona (324N-11437B) Weather Station
    was contacted and they advised that they were not conducting any
    balloon operations; however, an Army Weather unit was conducting
    such operations.

    d. Yuma Test Station-US Army Signal Corps, Meteorological Section
    was contacted and they advised that on 21 July 1957, four (4) balloons
    (Piswinsonde) were released, however, none drifted more than fifteen
    (15) miles from Yuma, Arizona.

3. Mr. Wielke, US Weather Bureau, Santa Monica, California was
    contacted and gave following information: Four (4) b ballons (Rawinsondes)
    were released on 21 July 1957 from Santa Monica. The first three
    (3) balloons were released in burst daylight hours. The fourth
    balloon was released at 2130 PDT and burst at 2240 PDT at an
    altitude of approximately one hundred (100,000) feet. From the surface to
    fifty-five thousand (55,000) feet the balloon was exposed to winds
    from northwest to slightly (15S) degrees to two hundred ten (210) degrees of
    undetermined velocity. From 55,000 feet to 99,000 feet winds are from

one hundred (100) to one hundred thirty (130) degrees at one hundred thirty-five (135) knots. Mr. Wilkie stated that tracking information was not available and that there was no light attached to the balloon. The balloons were neoprene filled with helium. Mr. Mike Putnam stated that such a balloon, particularly distant, light attached, would not be visible a long time after sighting, unless it was looking up one's eyes at an extremely high altitude early in the evening.

4. Gad Los Angeles International Airport was contacted and they advised that no unusual radar returns were noted at the time of this sighting. No-Lighter-Than-Air aircraft were known to be in the area.

5.

25. The Hawthorne Airport (Fig 1, Pt 2) Control Tower was contacted: no reports of unusual activity or sightings on 21 or 22 July 1957.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER

1. The preparing officer is unable to arrive at a definite conclusion
as to the cause of these sightings. However, the following possibilities
are offered for consideration:

a. Pranksters: Since the Hawthorne Fire Chief stated that
similar objects had been reported in the past in this same area,
that this conclusion was reached, it seems possible that this
sighting also could be attributed to pranksters. A small, gas filled
balloon with some type of lighting device and a fire would give the
appearance described in this report.

b. Night Photography: Possibly an individual or a concern
could have been releasing small balloons with photographic equipment
and flares for night, aerial photography. However, it would
seem reasonable that any company conducting such a test or operation
would notify CAA if they intended to release balloons in the
vicinity of any airfields.

2. An evaluation of "Probable balloons" is given to this series of
sightings.

The following article taken from the "LOS ANGELES TIMES"
Thursday Morning, July 22, 1957

[Headline] Silver Sphere
Deflated as
Sky Mystery

It was almost like with the
flying disks all over again..., the quarries started yesterday
afternoon among Big Bear Valley residents.

That is that pear-shaped
thing following the sun... very
slowly.

Then lowlanders took up the
curiosity cudgels, relaboring police, Sheriff's and newspaper
switchboards by the hundreds
of calls.

As afternoon wore into evening, the silver sphere was
tracked by thousands of neckcranking Southlanders while it
drifted lazily in a northerly
direction.

Aerial Visitor Identified

At Mt. Wilson, Dr. Robert S.
Richardson, solar observer, reported that he had scanned the
object as it passed nearly overhead and identified it as a forward, George Abell, Griffith Observatory astronomer, also reported
following the sphere by telescope.

The consensus, borne out by
the Weather Bureau forecast
center at Los Angeles Airport,
A meteorological balloon.
The balloons are supposed to
automatically broadcast weather
information during their ascent.
This one apparently was making
a slow leak and sank back to
warm earth, weatherman said.

A general warning of the balloon's hovering over Los Angeles area and its potential
to navigation was issued shortly after dark by the Cleveland
Aeronautics Administration air route
traffic control center here.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det. 4, 1200th AMS                  REPORT NO. DU-408-257     PART   ONE     PAGE    2   OF   21   PAGES

I. SUBJECT: Mr. [redacted]
    Address: [redacted], Inglewood, California
    Age: 20
    Occupation: General Building Contractor
    Education: High School
    Qualifications: During World War II, 300 was a CA/30

II. RELIABILITY: When interviewed SUBJECT was very cooperative and
    showed a marked interest in determining the cause of his sightings. He was
    coherent, talked freely and seemed to be of average intelligence. The information given by SUBJECT is considered to be reliable.

III. SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS AND EVENTS:
    1. On the evening of 21 July 1957, SUBJECT and his family
    were dining in their backyard patio. At approximately 2230 PDT, SUBJECT
    noticed an object in the sky just East of his home at an estimated altitude
    of one thousand (1,000) feet. SUBJECT described the object as a small sphere
    about the size of a small pan football at a length at the time of the first
    sighting. The object then moved Northward, then to the Northeast until it faded
    from sight at approximately 2040 PDT. Motion of the object was described as
    very slow and very much like a "small balloon caught in the wind currents".
    At 2250 PDT, another object, located to the NNE of SUBJECT's home near
    his family and a group of neighbors. This object was first sighted in the
    West, and is gradually moved Eastward to the vicinity of SUBJECT's home. At
    this time, SUBJECT telephoned the Los Angeles International Airport Control
    Tower and asked if they were releasing balloons with lights on or if
    not, did they see this object. Ref Fig 2 Pt 1. (Los Angeles International
    Airport) and Pt 3 (SUBJECT's home). Mr. [redacted] (tower supervisor at Los Angeles
    International Airport) answered the phone, stated that they were not releasing
    balloons and searched the sky with negative results. At 2107 PDT, this
    object apparently exploded and disappeared. The "explosion" was described
    as resembling a "miniature atom bomb explosion", white and orange in color.
    No noise was heard. Following the apparent explosion, the object disappeared
    completely. No falling debris was seen. At 2130 PDT, shift, identical
    object traveling the same course as the second, immediately upon sighting
    in the same approximate area as the second, immediately upon sighting this
    object, SUBJECT again called Los Angeles International Airport Tower and advised
    Mr. Morton that this object was to the North of the airfield. He meant
    Northeast direction. (Ref 2) However, Mr. [redacted] stated that he can't be
    certain. Mr. Morton at the airport and searched accordingly, to no avail. At
    this point, looking to the East, maintaining telephone contact with SUBJECT,
    he sighted an object that as it appeared to explode and disappear. At that
    time, SUBJECT saw this. (Ref 3) Mr. [redacted] (SUBJECT's brother-in-law
    was willing a broadcast extension to his telephone) SUBJECT was looking to
    the Northeast, at this time, in the Casa area.

    2. On the following evening (22 July 1957) at 2220 PDT, SUBJECT
    again sighted an object to the NNE of his home, in the same general area
    the object to be over International Airport. His wife also called the Airport
    Tower and spoke to Mr. Morton, but was told there were no balloons or other
