ON 26 JULY 1957 I received a phone call in Los Angeles from an individual who was very excited. He stated that he and another individual had observed an unidentified flying object at approximately 2215 hours on 25 July 1957. I met the individual at the specified location and obtained the following information:
The individual stated that at approximately 2215 hours on 25 July 1957 he and another individual were standing on Topanga Canyon Road looking in a northerly direction when they observed an unidentified object in the sky. The object appeared to be approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter and was circular in shape. It appeared to be at an approximate altitude of 2000 to 3000 feet and was traveling in a northerly direction at a very high speed. The object gave off a reddish-orange glow and was visible for approximately 15 seconds before disappearing below the horizon.
The individual stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. He was quite emphatic in stating that this was a genuine unidentified flying object.

On Sunday, 29 September 1957, the following incident involving sightings of a light craft took place over the Los Angeles area. The witnesses were a teenage girl and her boyfriend who were driving in a car on a country road at about 10:55 p.m. According to their report, they suddenly observed a light craft hovering over the road about 200 yards ahead of them. The craft appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and had a brilliant white light in the center. As they watched, the light dimmed and the craft moved away from them at a high rate of speed, tilting as it went. After it had passed over a hill, the light went out and it was gone. The witnesses stated that they were quite frightened when the craft first appeared and that it made no sound as it moved away.

CONTENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

The report indicates that the sighting was probably caused by balloons. However, the following possibilities are also considered:

1. Illusion: This could be attributed to "Searchlight" or small aircraft which could have appeared larger than normal.

2. Night Photography: Possibly an individual or concern with photographic skills launched and flares for night, aerial photography. However, it would require further investigation to substantiate any unusual conditions or phenomena.

3. As evaluation of "probable ball-cone" is given to this series of sightings.

The article describes an unidentified flying object (UFO) that was observed by many people in the Los Angeles area on July 29, 1957. According to the article, the object was described as a "silver sphere" that was eventually "deflated" and lost or disappeared from view.

OCR Text:
The following article taken from the "LOS ANGELES TIMES"
Tuesday Morning, July 30, 1957

Silver Sphere
Deflated as
Sky Mystery
A brilliant silver sphere, which
drew thousands of persons to their
windows and switchboards by the
hundreds along the West Coast
from San Francisco to San Diego
yesterday afternoon, deflated and
vanished as mysteriously as it appeared.
Aerial Visitor Identified:
An experimental weather balloon
from the Army's National Weather
Research Center at Los Angeles
Airport lost its silvered outer skin
and thus became invisible to the
naked eye, government officials
said.
Thousands watched the sphere as
it reflected the afternoon sun, changing size and color as it drifted across
the sky. Some telephoned newspaper
and radio stations demanding to
know what the silvery globe was.
The first report came from South
Pasadena about 12:45 p.m. and in
less than an hour reports came
from all over the Southland, from
Long Beach to San Fernando
Valley.
Weather men said the sphere was
a 6-foot-diameter experimental
balloon released from the National
Weather Research Center earlier
in the day for upper air observation.
As the plastic balloon rose to about
30,000 feet, its outer surface, coated with aluminum for visibility,
cracked and peeled off.
"It was an excellent experimental
balloon and we're sorry it got away
from us," one official said.
