AIRBORNE AERODYNE SLOWLY CIRCLES ABOVE HANGAR FLOOR, GUIDED BY INVENTOR LIPPISCH AT CONTROL PANEL

AIRCRAFT
WITH NO WINGS

A cigar-shaped object without wings or tail droned through the air last week inside a hangar in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It was the Aerodyne, a revolutionary model aircraft designed by Alexander Lippisch, German aeronautics expert who now works for the Collins Radio Company. The Aerodyne is driven by fans which blast air past louvers in the belly with enough force to keep it airborne. By tilting the louvers the Aerodyne can be moved forward, backward or made to hover.

Since the wings of conventional planes heat up and cause drag at supersonic speeds, Lippisch thinks the wingless Aerodyne forebodes the design of future jet-age aircraft. Suspecting that he may be right, the Office of Naval Research has given him a sizable sum to further his research.

AIRCRAFT'S POWER PLANT is ... ies which draw air through top of model (left), expel ... louvers in its belly (right). When louvers tilt backward, plane goes forward. When they tilt forward, plane goes backward; when open, plane hovers.

HEADQUARTERS
4602d AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SQUADRON (ADC)
ENT AIR FORCE BASE
COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO

AISOP

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Report

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: AFOTN-NEL
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. On 26 January 1956 this headquarters was informed by the Office of Special Investigation (OSI) that a UFOB had been sighted one mile east of Sublette Station, New Mexico, by Mr. [redacted], railroad conductor for the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad.

2. Although this organization felt that the sighting was in the realm of the nebulous and did not warrant a follow-up investigation, it was decided to transmit officially complete an ATIC Form 164 with the SOURCE to prevent the report from filtering into governmental agencies other than USAF and to avoid possible unfavorable publicity. At the same time Mr. [redacted] was instructed of the responsibilities of this squadron and of ATIC with respect to analysis, investigation, and release of evaluations to the public.

3. Forwarded herewith are two letters from Mr. [redacted] concerning the sighting and a completed ATIC Form 164 for your information and action deemed necessary. Further investigation of this sighting is not deemed necessary because of its failure to meet investigative criteria, the lack of a preliminary report, the elapsed time, and the definite overactive imagination of the SOURCE.

CHAMA, NEW MEXICO.
DECEMBER 30, 1955

MR. VERN HALLENBECK
COLO. SPGS. COLO.

DEAR VERN:-

SURE ENJOYED HEARING FROM YOU XMAS AND GLAD TO GET THAT RED FLASHING LANTERN AND ALSO VERY GLAD TO GET THE JUMPE AGAIN AND HAVE WONDERED A MILLION TIMES WHAT EVER BECOME OF I ALMOST TOOK THE CABOOSE APART LOOKING FOR IT AND YOUR XKXKX PACKAGE WAS A COMPLETE SURPRISE TO ME. THANKS AGAIN!

AND HERE IS SOMETHING ELSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW AND TO ME IT SEEMS THAT IT CONCERNS COL. HEITMAN OR SOME OTHER MILITARY MAN. PLEASE READ THE ATTACHED CLIPPINGS THAT I CU FROM A LOCAL PAPER SEVERAL DAYS AGO THEY TELL ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE SEEING A "THING" IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF COLORADO AND I WANT COL. HEITMAN TO KNOW THAT MY REAR BRAKEMAN AND MYSELF SAW THIS X "THING" THE AFTERNOON OF DECEMBER 8TH AND IT WAS NOT HIGH IN THE AIR, NOR WAS IT GOING AT A HIGH SPEED, WE SAW IT ABOUT A HUNDRED NORTH OF THE TRACK ONE MILE EAST OF SUBLET STATION AND IT SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO GET INTO THE AIR AND JUST BARELY CLEARED A ROW OF 30 FOOT HIGH ASPEN TREES AND THE WENT RIGHT DOWN OUT OF SIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL--- YOU KNOW "OVER THE HILL". THIS IS NOT A PIPE DREAM, VERN, LEROY SHELL AND I WATCHED IT SEVERAL SECONDS FROM THE CUPALO OF OUR CABOOSE AND WONDERED IF IT COULD BE A HELICOPTER IN TROUBLE, NEITHER OF US EVER SAW A HELICOPTER IN THE AIR AND WE WONDERED IF THE ROTOR BLADES TURNED SO FAST THEY COULD NOT BE SEEN. WE COULD NOT SEE ANY BLADES ABOVE THE MACHINE BUT IT LOOKED LIKE ITXMXM HAD ONE OR TWO BLACK PIPES STICKING OUT EACH SIDE. JUST ABOUT A FOOT OR SO. THE "THING" SEEMED ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL PANEL TRUCK BODY AND WAS A BLUE-GRAY COLC

AND HERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT INTEREST SOMEONE. ABOUT 6 OR 8 WEEKS AGO A BLOND BAREHEADED YOUNG MAN CAME DOWN TO THE DEPOT HERE IN CHAMA AND WANTED TO SEE SOME ONE WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE TERRITORY WHERE THE RR TRACK RUN BETWEEN ANTONIO AND CHAMA. I TOLD THIS FELLOW THAT I KNEW EVERY FOOT OF IT LIKE I KNEW MY BACK YARD AND THEN HE PULLED OUT SEVERAL AIR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY AND WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS VERY PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THIS "THING" WAS A FEW WEEKS LATER, HE TOLD ME HE WAS WORKING FC SOME MAP MAKERS. THIS AT THE FACT MIGHT MEAN SOMETHING.---THE "THING" AT THIS TIME WAS ABOUT 75 AIR MILES FROM LOS ALAMOS.

HAPPY NEW YEAR---VERN---TO YOU AND ALL THE OTHER FOLKS OUR CREWS KNOW AND PLEASE DO NOT THINK SHELL AND I WERE HAVING A PIPE DREAM LAST DECEMBER 8TH. REGARDS TO ALL.

Alamoosa Colorado
January 20, 1956.

Col. G. L. Heitman, Jr.
Chief of Staff
Fort Carson, Colorado.

Dear Colonel:-

Yours of 12 January 1956 regarding the flying machine my rear brakeman and myself saw one mile east of Sublette on date of 12-8-55. Was in a barber shop this afternoon getting my fringe of hair trimmed up (one hour and a quarter for five minutes work) and I found this picture of a new type of plane in Life magazine. Here is the exact type of plane or "thing" that LeRoy Shell and I watched for several seconds and what I described to you and which you asked me to look like.

Here is an exact picture of the outfit we saw getting over those quaken asp trees east of Sublette but I do believe the "thing" we saw was somewhat larger that this appears in the attached picture. The outfit we saw had black pipes sticking out each side and we were close enough to see that the pipes were square & instead of round.

The little description below the big picture says that this outfit is very new but I think that some one has it in actual service in this country. I sure your Air Force intelligence at Ent Air Force base in Colorado Springs gets on the job and finds out just what kind of stunt this outfit is mixed up in 70 Or 75 air miles from Los Alamos.

I wish you all the luck in the world at your new station in Tokyo and will look toward to the day when I can see all you folks again. Tell Vern "Hello" and with the very best of regards,

I remain,

Sincerely yours,

Box [redacted]
Alamoosa, Colorado.
