ATTN OF: AFCIN-Le

SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

TO: AFCIN-4 (w/Gen Doughery)

1. In keeping with a policy of producing the maximum of aerospace intelligence with a minimum expenditure of funds and utilization of manpower, AFCIN-Le in December 1959, recommended the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to Air Research and Development Command. It was pointed out at that time that after 12 years of experience AFCIN has yet to uncover any positive evidence that UFOs constitute a threat to national security. It was further pointed out that the UFO program's only potential value to the United States Air Force was due to its scientific and/or technical aspects. AHRO, after reviewing the program, declined the transfer indicating that the data available was not qualitative and therefore of limited scientific value. It is my opinion that the data available is limited qualitatively only because of the volume of UFO traffic required to be handled by this organization. In an effort to continue meeting the USAF obligations to this program and also to disassociate it with intelligence, it is suggested that the Aerial Phenomena Program be transferred to SAFOI. The attached draft of a letter to General Walsh clearly indicates the benefits which might be derived from such a transfer.

2. If you concur with these suggestions, it is recommended that the draft of the attached letter be authenticated and forwarded to AFCIN.

Subject:  Transfer of UFO

MEMORANDUM TO MAJOR GENERAL DOUGHER

1.  My comments on the transfer proposed in Colonel Evans' memorandum of 31 March 1960 are as follows.

2.  I have tried during the last ten years of close association with this program to get it out of ATIC, for most of the reasons given in Colonel Evans' letter and its attachment.  However, I have some additional comments:

a.  This program has a high psychological warfare potential (an example being the H. G. Wells "War of the Worlds" put on as a radio show by Orson Wells some years ago).  Defense against this is not a function of intelligence.

b.  I do not agree that, as stated in paragraph 4e, "loss of prestige to UFO program" is a disadvantage.  In fact, I have been trying to bring this about totally.

3.  Major Tacker of SAPFO I is about to publish a book on UFO.  This would surely destroy the claim of objectivity which the Air Force has made.

4.  This transfer would certainly ease the 4X3 personnel problem.

5.  If a transfer of personnel is involved in this matter, I recommend that Major R. J. Friend of Captain George T. Gregory go with the program; that is, if they are awaiting reassignment or if they can be spared.  A better alternative might be to have either of these officers named ATIC representative in an advisory capacity only and upon call.  A much better alternative, and the one I recommend, would be for Dr. J. Allen Hynek to be retained by SAPFO I as the scientific advisor on this subject.

REPLY TO
ATTN OFF: AFCIN-4
SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

TO: AFCIN (Major General Walsh)

1. During December 1959, a study was conducted by AFCIN-4E, ATIC, recommending the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to the Air Research and Development Command. It was pointed out that 12 years experience with the UFO program had failed to reveal any threat to national security, and that any value from the program would be derived from exploitation of its scientific and technical aspects. After review of the program, ARDC declined the transfer indicating the data available was not qualitative and therefore was of limited scientific value. It is the opinion of ATIC that the data available is limited qualitatively only because of the volume of UFO traffic required to be handled by this organization. If the cases which give indication of possessing scientific and/or technical value were to be exploited fully, it is believed that they would be of benefit to the USAF. It was further pointed out in the study, and by ARDC, that the great majority of these cases are valuable to the Air Force only as statistics and as they relate to the public relations aspects of the program. The Air Force must continue its responsibility for operation of this project; however, in view of the fact that this program, for the most part, deals with public relations it is suggested that it be transferred to SAFOI. SAFOI is presently responsible for the public relations portion of the program and this transfer would only entail expansion of the branch within SAFOI responsible for this function.

2. This program could operate without the loss of its possible military and scientific value if conducted as follows:

a. The reports will by regulation be forwarded to SAFOI for initial evaluation and storage. An officer with a technical background, and preferably with intelligence experience, will be assigned to that branch of SAFOI charged with this responsibility and will conduct this initial evaluation.

b. Those reports which reach SAFOI which give indication of having possible Intelligence value or scientific and technical possibilities will be forwarded to AFCIN and/or ARDC for further evaluation and/or exploitation.


- page 4 -

Here is the text from the document:

1. The conduct of the program in the field (investigations) will still be the responsibility of the Air Force bases. At the bases it will still be preferably the Intelligence function which will be responsible for these investigations.

3. The advantages of this transfer are:

a. SAFOI is familiar with the Aerial Phenomena Program.

b. Reports will be evaluated immediately at the office responsible for public relations.

c. The reports which show promise of additional value, either from an intelligence and/or scientific viewpoint, will be forwarded to speculating agencies for further exploitation. Under this method of operation the number of reports which agencies such as ATIC and ARDC are required to handle would be cut to a minimum, allowing for more man-hours per report and consequently better analysis and evaluation.

d. The program will lose some of the aura of mystery which surrounds it due to its association with intelligence.

e. ATIC will be free to apply man-hours, previously applied to the UFO project, to other programs more beneficial to the Air Force.

f. ATIC prestige will lose the damaging effects which can be attributed to its association with a program so much in the public eye.

4. There are certain disadvantages associated with this change, the magnitude of which will decrease as the agencies concerned become familiar with the new method of operation:

a. The requirement for the office handling this program to establish the necessary security measures for handling classified intelligence reports.

b. It will be the responsibility of one individual not directly concerned with intelligence to determine which reports are of possible intelligence value.

c. Possibility of delay of reports with intelligence value getting into proper channels and the resulting delay of evaluation and dissemination of intelligence information.

d. The necessity for familiarizing sub-units of the Air Force with a new method of operating the Aerial Phenomena Program.

- page 5 -

5. It has been pointed out that there would possibly be a lag in intelligence information finding its way into the proper channels. However, it should be immediately obvious that reports which originate from intelligence source would remain primarily in intelligence channels with information copies of these reports, when deemed necessary due to their relation with the Aerial Phenomena Program, forwarded to the office in SAFOI which handles the project. The program should suffer little from being severed from an organization with a scientific and technical capability. The office within SAFOI responsible for this program could request the services of any agency with the government complex, which has a scientific and/or technical capability, for assistance in the evaluation of these reports.

6. The officer presently conducting the program for ATIC is available for transfer along with the project. This officer is capable of performing the function spelled out in paragraph 2a of this document.

7. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Astrophysicist and Director of the Observatory at Northwestern University should be retained as the scientific consultant to this program. Dr. Hynek's experience with the aerial phenomena program spans the entire 12 years that the Air Force has conducted this program, and this experience would be invaluable to any future Air Force efforts in this area.

8. It is believed that this method of operating the Aerial Phenomena Program would be the most beneficial to the USAF. The long range aims are to eliminate this costly program completely as an Air Force responsibility. The first step, however, is to eliminate the most unproductive aspects of this program (i.e. hoax and garden variety UFO reports) as a responsibility of intelligence.

9. If you concur with the recommendations of this letter, it is suggested that the necessary steps be taken to effect the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to SAFOI.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN (Major General Walsh)
SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

TO: SAFOAI (Major General A. H. Luehman)

1. In the fall of 1947, the USAF took official notice of reports of unidentified flying objects. Responsibility for the UFO project was assigned to the Intelligence community.

2. The project, as established, was to determine if UFO's were hostile, had any possible scientific value, and to determine the nature of each of these objects. After 12 years and more than 8000 reports, the Air Force has not discovered any evidence which would indicate that UFO's are inimical or pose a security threat in any way.

3. In the absence of evidence to indicate a possible security threat the scientific and public relations aspects of the program gained stature. It becomes obvious that with these new objectives the program's assignment to Intelligence is no longer practical. Experience during the same 12 years has indicated that the program is more a public relations program than anything else. The few reports that may have intelligence and/or scientific and technical value have a tendency to become lost in the volume of UFO traffic. In an effort to overcome this shortcoming, it is my opinion that the aerial phenomena project should be assigned to SAFOAI.

4. To prevent the loss of valuable information, intelligence, scientific, and/or technical, it is suggested that an individual with a technical and intelligence background be assigned to the branch of SAFOAI which becomes responsible for the program. All reports which have indication of value in the intelligence and/or scientific areas would be routed to the appropriate agency for exploitation. The officer presently conducting the program for ATIC is available for transfer along with the project. This officer is capable of performing the function spelled out in this paragraph.

5. It is suggested that Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Astrophysicist and Director of the Observatory at Northwestern University, be retained

as the scientific consultant to the program, Dr. Hynek has performed in this capacity for ATIC since 1947, and his experience and "know how" would be invaluable to Air Force efforts in conducting the aerial phenomena program.

6. With your concurrence, I propose to initiate the action to transfer the aerial phenomena program to SAFOI.

6. The officer presently conducting the program for ATIC is available for transfer along with the project. This officer is capable of performing the function spelled out in paragraph 2a of this document.

7. Dr. J. Allen Synek, Astrophysicist and Director of the Observatory at Northwestern University should be retained as the scientific consultant to this program. Dr. Synek's experience with the aerial phenomena program spans the entire 12 years that the Air Force has conducted this program, and this experience would be invaluable to any future Air Force efforts in this area.

8. It is believed that this method of operating the Aerial Phenomena Program would be the most beneficial to the USAF. The long range aims are to eliminate this costly program completely as an Air Force responsibility. The first step, however, is to eliminate the most unproductive aspects of this program (i.e. houx and garden variety UFO reports) as a responsibility of intelligence.

9. If you concur with the recommendations of this letter, it is suggested that the necessary steps be taken to effect the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to SAFOI.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN (Major General Walsh)
SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

TO: SAFOI (Major General A. H. Luekhman)

1. In the fall of 1947, the USAF took official notice of reports of unidentified flying objects. Responsibility for the UFO project was assigned to the intelligence community.

2. The project, as established, was to determine if UFO's were hostile, had any possible scientific value, and to determine the nature of each of these objects. After 12 years and more than 5000 reports, the Air Force has not discovered any evidence which would indicate that UFO's are inimical or pose a security threat in any way.

3. In the absence of evidence to indicate a possible security threat the scientific and public relations aspects of the program gained stature. It becomes obvious that with those new objectives the program's assignment to Intelligence was no longer practical. Experience during the same 12 years has indicated that the program is more a public relations program than anything else. The few reports that may have intelligence and/or scientific and technical value have a tendency to become lost in the volume of UFO traffic. In an effort to overcome this shortcoming, it is suggested that the aerial phenomena project should be assigned to SAFOI.

4. To prevent the loss of valuable information; intelligence, scientific, and/or technical, it is suggested that an individual with a technical and intelligence background be assigned to the branch of SAFOI which becomes responsible for the program. All reports which have indication of value in the intelligence and/or scientific areas would be routed to the appropriate agency for exploitation. The officer presently conducting the program at ATIC is available for transfer along with the project. This is capable of performing the function spelled out in this paragraph.

5. It is suggested that Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Astrophysicist and Director of the Observatory at Northwestern University, be retained

as the scientific consultant to the program. Dr. Hynek has performed in this capacity for ATIC since 1947, and his experience and know how would be invaluable to Air Force efforts in conducting the serial phenomena program.

6. With your concurrence, I propose to initiate the action to transfer the serial phenomena program to SAFOI.

AFCIN-14
Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

AFCIN-4 (w/Gen Dougher)

1. In keeping with a policy of producing the maximum of aerospace intelligence with a minimum expenditure of funds and utilization of manpower, AFCIN-14 in December 1959, recommended the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to Air Intelligence and Development Command. It was pointed out at that time that after 12 years of experience ATC has yet to uncover any positive evidence that UFO's constitute a threat to national security. It was further pointed out that the UFO program's only potential value to the United States Air Force was the use its scientific and/or technical aspects. ATIC, after reviewing the program, decided the transfer indicating that the data available was not, qualitative and therefore of limited scientific value. It is my opinion that the data available is limited qualitatively only because we do not have volume of UFO traffic required to be handled by this organization. In an effort to continue meeting the USAF obligation to this program and also to disassociate it with intelligence, it is suggested that the Aerial Phenomena Program be transferred to SAFOI. The attached draft of a letter to General Walsh indicates the intent which might be derived from such a transfer.

2. If you concur with these suggestions, it is recommended that the draft of the attached letter be substantiated and forwarded to AFCIN.

SUBJ: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

1. During December 1959, a study was conducted by AFCIN-LEA, ATIC, recommending the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to the Air Research and Development Command. It was pointed out that 12 years experience with the UFO program had failed to reveal any threat to national security, and that any value from the program would be derived from exploitation of its scientific and technical aspects. After review of the program, ARDC declined the transfer indicating the data available was not qualitative and therefore was of limited scientific value. It is the opinion of ATIC that the data available is limited qualitatively only because of the volume of UFO traffic required to be handled by this organization. If the cases which give indication of possessing scientific and/or technical value were to be exploited fully, it is believed that they would be of benefit to the USAF. It was further pointed out in the study, and by ARDC, that the great majority of these cases are valuable to the Air Force only as statistics and as they relate to the public relations aspects of the program. The Air Force must continue its responsibility for operation of this program; however, in view of the fact that this program, for the most part, deals with public relations it is suggested that it be transferred to SAFOII. SAFOII is presently responsible for the public relations portion of the program and this transfer would only entail expansion of the branch within SAFOII responsible for this function.

2. This program could operate without the loss of its possible military and scientific value if conducted as follows:

a. The reports will by regulation be forwarded to SAFOII for initial evaluation and storage. An officer with a technical background, and preferably with intelligence experience, will be assigned to that branch of SAFOII charged with this responsibility and will conduct this initial evaluation.


- page 28 -

b. Those reports which reach SAFOI which give indication of having
possible intelligence value or scientific and technical possibilities will
be forwarded to AFCIN and/or ARDC for further evaluation and/or exploitation.

c. The conduct of the program in the field (investigations) will still
be the responsibility of the Air Force bases. At the bases it will still be
preferably the intelligence function which will be responsible for these
investigations.

3. The advantages of this transfer are:
a. SAFOI is familiar with the Aerial Phenomena Program.

b. Reports will be evaluated immediately at the office responsible
for public relations.

c. The number of reports which show promise of additional value either
from an intelligence and/or scientific viewpoint will be cut to a minimum,
thereby allowing specializing agencies to devote more man hours per report.

d. The program will lose some of the aura of mystery which surrounds
it due to its association with intelligence.

e. ATIC will be free to supply more hours, previously applied to the
program, to other programs more beneficial to the Air Force.

f. ATIC prestige will lose the damaging effects which can be attributed
to its association with a program so much in the public eye.

4. There are certain disadvantages associated with this change, the magnitude of which will decrease as the agencies concerned become familiar with
the new method of operation:

a. The requirement for the office handling this program to establish
the necessary security measures for handling classified intelligence reports.

b. It will be the responsibility of one individual not directly concerned with intelligence to determine which reports are of possible intelligence value.

- page 29 -

c. Possibility of delay of reports with intelligence value getting into proper channels and the resulting delay of evaluation and dissemination of intelligence information.

d. The necessity for familiarizing sub-units of the Air Force with a new method of operating the Aerial Phenomena Program.

e. Loss of prestige to the Aerial Phenomena Program due to its association with an agency having no specific scientific or technical capability.

5. It has been pointed out that there would possibly be a lag in intelligence information finding its way into the proper channels. However, it should be immediately obvious that reports which originates from intelligence sources would remain primarily in intelligence channels with information copies of these reports, when deemed necessary due to their relation with the Aerial Phenomena Program, forwarded to the office in SAFOI which handles the project.

The program should suffer little from being severed from an organization with a scientific and technical capability. The office within SAFOI responsible for this program could request the services of any agency within the government complex, which has a scientific and/or technical capability, for assistance in the evaluation of these reports.

6. It is believed that this method of operating the Aerial Phenomena Program would be the most beneficial to the USAF. The long range aims are to eliminate this costly program completely as an Air Force responsibility. The first step, however, is to eliminate the most unproductive aspects of this program (i.e. hoax and garden variety UFO reports) as a responsibility of intelligence.
