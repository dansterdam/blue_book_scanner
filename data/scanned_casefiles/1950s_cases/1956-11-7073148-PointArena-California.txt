Some text appears to be partially illegible or cut off, so I have transcribed only the text I can clearly read.

The text on this page is largely illegible due to poor image quality and what appears to be a heavily redacted or encoded document. While some characters and fragments are visible, I cannot confidently transcribe the full text with certainty. The document appears to be a typewritten page with multiple lines of text, but the specific content is not clearly readable.

At the bottom of the page, there is a partially visible line that seems to read "NOT TO BE PUBLISHED" but even this is not completely clear.
