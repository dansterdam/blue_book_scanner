CUTTER SIGHTS
FLYING OBJECT
OFF LOUISIANA

Noted on Ship Radar,
Guard Reports

[Continued from first page]

About the signal classified, but
an FCC spokesman was later
quoted as saying:
"We just
don't know yet what it is."
The signal, tracked from a recording was a long
note of low pitch, followed
after a few seconds by two
short notes.
Last month shortly after
Sputnik I went aloft, several
radio hams at Phoenix, Ariz.,
reported hearing a series of
strange signals adjacent to the
30.08 frequency used by the
Russian satellite.

A Washington government official in Washington who declined to be identified even as
to agency, said they were unable to diagnose the matter exactly. The signals were
not connected with sputnik in
any way. The implication was
that a hush-hush project, probably military, was involved.

Subject Was Wisconsin
Sooner, Wis., Nov. 5 (JP) —
William Stewart, editor of
this northwestern Wisconsin
area—including an Episcopal
minister and a newspaper editor—reported sighting a bright
object about sunset yesterday.

The Rev. R. C. Warder, rector of
St. Albans church, said he
was driving 20 miles northeast of Sooner when he saw
the "cigar shaped object" in
the western sky.

William Stewart, editor of
the Sooner Advocate, reported he saw the object
when returning in the western sky. Stewart went outside his office
with a pair of field glasses
and confirmed that he could
see a distant object, but could
not identify it.

"Device Unknown"
Washington, Nov. 5 (JP) —
The air force said today it
has assigned trained investigators to look into the current
flurry of reported sightings of
strange flying objects.

The council is preparing
air defense command to keep

been reported by it.

Several ports spoke of an egg shaped object several hundred feet
long.

No Saucer Data Found, AF Says

The Air Force says its investigation of 5,700 reported sightings of mysterious flying objects in the past 10 years have produced "no physical or material evidence" that such things exist.

The Pentagon issued this report last night after sightings of mysterious flying objects were reported from various parts of the country.

The Air Force said, "There is not even a minute fragment of a so-called flying saucer."

It also said there is no evidence that the alleged objects are interplanetary space ships, that they indicate developments beyond scientific knowledge, or that they pose any threat to the Nation's security.

In Pensacola, Fla., the naval air station's radar operator at the Sebago yesterday estimated a flying object sighted over the Gulf the day before had a speed of between 1,000 and 1,500 miles an hour.

The first and second sightings on the cutter's radar screen.

The object was first spotted at 8:20 a.m. (EST) as the Sebago was cruising in the Gulf 300 miles southeast of New Orleans. It was seen by four men on watch for about three seconds at 5:21 a.m. The last radar contact was at 5:37 a.m.

The officer said the radar indicated the brilliant object was about 14 miles from the cutter and moving from north to south and faded rapidly astern on the radar scope.

Second Contact Reported

A second contact was made. "Its range was very close and it was coming back in the opposite direction," the officer said. It had been traveling—in other words from south to north. It moved up the coast and back to the area of the Sebago and again no audible or visual contact was made.

One another radar contact was made at a distance of 22 miles on a bearing of 188 degrees. No continued.

Ten minutes later it was at a range of 190 degrees at a range of 55 miles. I consider those the two best possible chances we had to clock it for speed and size.

But the officer said, "We went almost 1,000 miles an hour."

Lt. (j.g.) Donald Shaffer of Greensboro, Pa., said he based the estimate on elapsed time and distance traveled between the two best possible chances.

The object appeared stationary.
5:21—The object was seen, moving horizontally south to north. It was seen for about 15 minutes and resembled a brilliant planet with a high rate of speed.

The Sebago is expected to report back to its home base in Mobile by Thursday.

Mystery Signal Heard
New York, Nov. 5 (A)—A mysterious radio signal not emanating from Russia's new Sputnik is baffling short wave listeners and government officials at the National Broadcast. A company said today.

The report said the signal is being heard near the satellite's frequency but is of a different tonal pattern.

The report added that the federal communications commission called information [Continued on page 4, col. 1]

Admits Reds Ahead
In the afternoon Secretary of State Dulles told a news conference that Russia appears to lead the United States in the missile field in some respects, but expressed confidence that this country can catch up.

The United States, he said, will demonstrate that, like Russia, it has the capacity to launch an artificial "moon." He said such a launching will be helpful to this country from a psychological point of view. Meanwhile, he added, Russia's demonstration proceeded as a weapon of psychological warfare.

ON SCIENCE
BY WALTER TROHAN

(Chicago Tribune Press Service)
Washington, Nov. 5.—An extraordinary two hour cabinet session was held today, President Eisenhower tonight announced that he will make an address of major importance Thursday night on science and security on national radio and television hookups.

The cabinet meeting was held against the ominous background of Russian scientific and military accomplishments and the related legislative and budget problems confronting the administration for 1958. Several White House sources said that the President will schedule a press conference tomorrow morning because he will cover the same information in his Thursday night speech.

State Live Broadcast
The address, the first of his conference "speeches" promised recently, will be carried live by the Columbia Broadcasting system from 7 to 7:30 p. m., Chicago time. The White House said the American Broadcasting system will show a film of the speech at 8:30 p. m. and National Broadcasting company at 10:15 p. m., Chicago time. Mutual Broadcasting system will rebroadcast the speech at 10 p. m., Chicago time.

Cabinet members left the White House after deliberations with the President. They will return Friday for another assessment of problems confronting the administration.

Meet Again Friday
The White House and cabinet members would not disclose that the extraordinary session and the regular session Friday were concerned with the startling Russian developments in rocket and missile research. It was conceded, however, that no conclusion of 1958 spending could fail to be influenced by the Red earth satellite and their repercussions on world affairs.

The solemn mien of cabinet members evidenced concern over the impending full scale senate investigation into what the United States needs to win the race for superiority over the soviet union in rocket missile developments.

Admits Reds Ahead
In the afternoon Secretary of State Dulles told a news conference that Russia appears to lead the United States in the missile field in some respects, but expressed confidence this country can catch up.

New Orleans, Nov. 5 (JP)—The coast guard cutter Sebago sighted an unidentified flying object over the Gulf of Mexico at 5:21 a. m. today. The object, seen for about three seconds, resembled a brilliant planet moving at tremendous speed.

Coast guard headquarters in New Orleans received a radio message about the sighting from the ship's captain exactly who on board the cut- ter had seen the object.

But the message said the object had been tracked on the Sabago's radar screen for 11 minutes before the visual contact and for 16 minutes after.

During these periods, the object darted off the screen every few minutes but soon returned.

Gives Location of Ship
Comdr. James Schrader, head of search and rescue operations in the gulf, said the object had been seen at latitude 25.47 north, longitude 89.24 west or about 200 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi river.

Comdr. Schrader said the radio message gave this log of the morning incident:

5:10 a. m.—The object was seen on the radar screen, moving north to south, about 14 miles from the cutter. The object continued to move closer, shifting toward the port side.

5:14—Contact was lost.
5:16—Contact was regained.
5:21—Contact at 22 miles north of the cutter.
5:18—The object, about 55 miles from the Sebago, faded off the screen.

Toll Object's Changes
5:20—Contact was regained.
The object appeared stationary, seven miles due north.
5:21—The object was seen, moving horizontally south to north. It was seen for about three seconds and resembled a brilliant planet with a high rate of speed.

5:37—The cutter reported its last radar contact with the object about 175 miles north of the ship.

New Sky Mystery Seen
As Guessing Continues
Coast Guard Says Brilliant Light Flying
Over Gulf Of Mexico At High Speed

WASHINGTON, Nov. 5—A brilliant mystery object was reported sighted today in southern skies by a coast guard cutter, even as Air Force specialists investigated a flurry of earlier similar reports.

The coast guard cutter Sebago, cruising in the Gulf of Mexico 120 miles south of Louisiana, radioed that an object resembling "a brilliant planet with a high rate of speed" was seen for about three seconds at 5:21 a.m.

Coast Guard headquarters in New Orleans said they mean the object was seen by the ship's navigator and others on board the cutter had seen the object.

Sightings of strange objects have been reported from widely scattered sections of the United States since Sunday, most of them near secret military installations in the Southwest.

Radar Keeping Watch

The Air Force said the radar command is keeping watch—so far with no results—and that specially qualified investigators have been assigned to look into the reports.

For several years the Air Force has checked all reports of unidentified flying objects. Investigators work under the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Colorado Springs, Colo., and report to the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

The chances are the Air Force will attribute the current sightings to natural phenomena or such ordinary man-made objects as aircraft.

During the first half of this year, the Air Force said, only 13 per cent of the 250 reported sightings of flying saucers and other unidentified aerial objects were made up of "unknowns."

And the Air Force said firmly—though not all flying saucer buffs will be satisfied—that they continue to believe even the 1.9 per cent residue is made up of things you read about in science fiction magazines.

From Another Planet?

Balloons, aircraft and such astronomical sights as meteors and bright stars account—according to the Air Force—to the satisfaction—for almost four-fifths of the sightings.

The Air Force said an organization set up to investigate flying saucers and such had said he couldn't evaluate at this point the current rash of reports.

But retired Marine Maj. Donald B. Kehoe, director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, added from another planet.

"Assuming they are real," he said, "they would be secret weapons, made on earth or another planet, and if they are not the secret, he added, would be by now have abandoned conventional aircraft or missiles.

U.S. Cutter
Sees 'Object'
Over Gulf
Radar Contact
Is Maintained
For 27 Minutes

Associated Press
A brilliant mystery object
was reported sighted yester-
day in southern skies by a
Coast Guard cutter, even as
Air Force special investigat-
ors checked a flurry of ear-
lier, similar reports.
The Coast Guard cutter Se-
bago was cruising in the Gulf
of Mexico about 200 miles
south of Louisiana, radioed
object resembling "a brilliant
planet with a high rate of
speed" was seen for about
three seconds at 5:21 a. m.
(CST).

The Sebago's message said
the object was tracked on the
vessel's radar screen for 27
minutes and that, during that
period, the object tilted on
and off the screen at times.
Crewmen caught sight
of it only for a few seconds.
[The Sebago radioed New
Orleans/ Coast Guard Head-
quarters that the object was
traveling at an estimated 1000
miles per hour. The Inter-
national News Service report-
ed, at one point, the object
appeared to remain stationary
and hover above the waters be-
low before resuming its errat-
ic flight.

Strong Pip
[The cutter's captain, Cmdr.
C. H. Waring, said the object
first appeared on the ship's
radar screen as a "good, strong
pip" at 4:54 a.m. and moved
in a northerly direction at 5:37
a.m.

In this time, the captain
said the object, which was as
close as two miles to the ves-

sel, was actually seen by four
members of the crew. One,
D. Shockley, de-
scribed it as a "bright point
of light with a haze around it
resembling the planet Venus."
Shockley said there were no
other indications as to the ob-
ject's method of propulsion.
One estimate of its height placed
it at 1600 feet.

Willis Wills, Okla. rancher and member
the University of Oklahoma
faculty, said he and five
others had watched "a bril-
liant, mysterious light, that
looked like the planet Venus"
hanging in the sky Saturday.
The object, he said, was visible
more than half an hour.]

Air Force Set
To Study 3 of
46 'Objects'

Waco, Tex. (INS) - The North American Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs, Colo., yesterday reported 46 unidentified objects from throughout the Nation out only three, in Nebraska, were further studied.

Capt. Andy Beasley, public information officer, said two Air Force investigators were sent to Kearney, Neb., to talk to R. O. Schmidt, told of four men who had seen the objects on a Nebraska prairie and chat with four men and two women.

Beasley said the command had not yet decided whether to assign investigators to reported sightings. He did not say where these reports came from.

A dazzling fiery object across southern skies flashed across southern skies yesterday and some observers reported it zoomed close to the horizon. Other sightings came from Albany, Ga., to Miami. The majority described it as blue or green.

Ed Thingbahasse, a Florida State University professor said the objects it appeared to be meteor-like came unusually bright.

N. E. Lauser, the professor and meteorologist, appeared to give particular at night.

The navigator of the Coast Guard cutter flying object maker that a Gulf of Mexico Tuesday had a speed of between 1000 and 3500 miles an hour.

Time Figured ?7?

Capt. Glyn Donald Shaffer of Greenburg, Pa., said he based the estimate on elapsed time and distance.

When the first and second screens on the cutter's radar screen.

The cutter refueled at the Norfolk Naval Air Station during the morning yesterday and then departed for its home port via the USS Shockley of Kearns, Calif., who was officer of the dock when the object was sighted. And, after leaving Norfolk, Tex., left the ship to fly to New York to appear today on a national television show.

Crewmen said they have not yet been questioned by Air Force investigators.

U.S. Ship in Gulf Reports Sighting Mystery Object

[The rest of the text is partially cut off or difficult to read in full, but I can make out portions of the article discussing a mystery object sighting by a U.S. ship, with mentions of investigations by Air Force and other officials. There are references to James Stokes, an engineer, and Leonard Hardund, a chief engineer for the National Investigations Council. The article discusses sightings of flying objects and attempts to understand their nature.]

Some key phrases I can clearly read include:
- "Command was keeping watch for such reported objects"
- "Some of the citizens... reported sightings"
- "Two teen-age girls reported seeing a mysterious object in the sky over Annapolis, MD"

The article appears to be a news report about unidentified flying object sightings, with various officials and witnesses providing accounts.

NEW ORLEANS, NOV. 5--(UP) -- A U.S. COAST GUARD COMMANDER REPORTED A BRILLIANT FLYING OBJECT HOVERED OVER THE CUTTER SEBAGO IN THE GULF OF MEXICO EARLY TODAY, MAKING CREW MEMBERS FEEL THEY WERE BEING OBSERVED--

CMDR. C.H. WARING, SKIPPER OF THE CUTTER, SAID THE OBJECT RESEMBLING THE STAR VENUS THEN STREAKED INTO A CLOUD AT A SPEED OBSERVERS ESTIMATED AT 1,000 MILES AN HOUR.

WARING SAID FOUR CREWMEN WHO OBSERVED THE OBJECT GOT A FIX ON IT WITH A SEXTANT AND ALSO TRACKED IT BY RADAR, ENABLING THEM TO GET A ROUGH CALCULATION OF ITS ALTITUDE AND SPEED BY INSTRUMENTS.

THE OBJECT RESEMBLED A STAR, WARING SAID, YET WE COULD NOT REALLY DESCRIBE ITS SHAPE. WE WEREN'T SCARED, BUT I'T PUZZLED US.

THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED ABOUT 200 MILES SOUTH OF THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AT 5:10 A.M. CST AND WAS PICKED UP INTERMITTENTLY BY RADAR UNTIL IT CT 236 INTO A CLOUD BANK AT ABOUT 2,000 FEET.

IT WAS VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE FOR THREE SECONDS AT 5:22 A.M. WHILE IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A GREAT ARC, HE SAID.

WARING SAID RADAR *BLIPS* OF THE OBJECT WERE *VERY STRONG.*

RADAR TRACKING SHOWED THE OBJECT REACHED SPEEDS OF UP TO 1,000 MILES PER HOUR, COMMANDER J. N. SCHRADER, SEARCH AND RESCUE OFFICER, SAID IN NEW ORLEANS.

THE OBJECT HAD NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION AND LEFT NO VAPOR TRAILS, WARING SAID.

COAST GUARD OFFICIALS BRIEFED NEWSMEN IN A RADIO ROOM IN THE NEW ORLEANS CUSTOM HOUSE BEFORE A HUGE MAP OF THE GULF OF MEXICO SHOWING THE SEBAGO'S POSITION.

*KEEN INTEREST AMONG NEWS CREW. THEY HAD *CONFIDENCE THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN ACTUAL SIGHTING*, HE SAID.

WARING SAID IT WAS HIS PERSONAL OPINION THAT THE MYSTERY LIGHT BORE NO RELATION TO THE SOVIET SATELLITE CARRYING A DOG.

COAST GUARD OFFICIALS HERE SAID THE ENTIRE REPORT FROM THE SEBAGO HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON.

THE SEBAGO'S MEN REPORTED THEY TRACKED THE OBJECT ON RADAR FIRST IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION AND MINUTES LATER IN A SOUTH-NORTH DIRECTION.

LT. JG DONALD SHAFFER OF GREESBURG, PA., THE CUTTER'S NAVIGATOR, ESTIMATED THE ALTITUDE AT *LESS THAN 1,000 FEET.*

CONTACTED BY THE SHIP-TO-SHORE RADIO FACILITIES SHAFFER AND RADIOMAN THOMAS KIRK OF BROOKLYN, N.Y. TOLD HOW THEY TRACKED THE OBJECT AND LATER SAW A BRILLIANT FLASH ACROSS THE SKY.

KIRK SAID HE FIRST TRACKED THE OBJECT AT A DISTANCE OF 14 MILES AS IT MOVED AT A HIGH SPEED IN A NORTH TO SOUTH DIRECTION. HE TRACKED IT GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, AND THEN SAW IT, HE SAID.

*I SAW IT MOVING QUITE RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY,* KIRK SAID. *IT BEGAN MOVING AND DISAPPEARED INTO A CLOUD. THEN IT WAS MOVING AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED.*

THE OFFICER DISCOUNTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A METEOR BECAUSE *THERE WAS NO TRAIL, AND IT MOVED IN A HORIZONTAL RATHER THAN A VERTICAL DIRECTION ACROSS THE SKY.*

Central Guard Directive - Safeguard in their reports, etc. the details of their operations.

On Tuesday morning the 5th in Sardagna was about 200 miles south of the Mississippi River on a northerly course.

At 5:10 a.m. her radar picked up a large blip to the left distance of about 14 miles. This was really nothing unusual because they were under heavily traveled air lanes.

The early morning watch is always rough and so the small group of officers and men in the Combat Information Center quietly watched the target, with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm. It moved south, made a turn, and headed back to the north again.

A few of the men noticed that the blip looked a little different, but this early in the morning they didn't give it much thought.

At 5:16 the target went off the scope to the north.

At 5:16 it was back and the latitude was instantly gone.

Now the target was 22 miles south of the ship. In one of the CIC had to draw a picture. Something, in the meantime, had disappeared off the scope to the north, so a big circle writing the sky, out of radar range, and had come in from the south.

Word went up to the lookouts. They turned up and began to scan the sky.

The radar contacts continued.

This second contact, south of the ship, was held for two full minutes as the target moved out from 22 to 55 miles. Then it moved.

At 5:20 the target was back but now it was north of the ship again, and it was hovering!

Again the lookouts were called. Could they see anything now? Their "No" answer didn't hold for long because seconds later their track reports began to come into the CIC. A brilliant light, like a planet, was streaming across the northwest sky about 30 degrees above the horizon. Unfortunately the radar lost contact for a moment when the visual report came in.

At 5:37 the target disappeared from the scopes and was gone for good.


- page 17 -

Tuesday morning's chief contribution to the UFO epidemic was not to be laughed off so easily, for it was made by trained military personnel. At 5:10 A.M. on November 5, the Coast Guard Cutter Sebago, traveling north in the Gulf of Mexico, detected an erratically maneuvering UFO on the radarscope. The swiftly moving object would race across and off the scope almost immediately from another direction and position and again move off the scope at increased speed. After ten minutes the radar target vanished, but watchers on the deck glimpsed a glowing object, brilliant as a planet, it streaked across the sky just above the northwest horizon and vanished. The unknown radar targets then returned and continued to fill the scope with their incredible movements until 5:37, when they finally disappeared and did not return.

This mystery, too, yielded to orderly investigation by the Air Force. The ship, some miles south of New Orleans, was moving under heavily traveled air lanes. The radar targets came not from a single, fantastically maneuverable UFO but from the complex pattern of air traffic overhead. Weather conditions accounted for the unusual and briefly puzzling radar echoes (see Chapter viii). The brilliant light that flashed across the sky was not reported by the radarscope and had no relation to the radar returns. In view of the sun for a few seconds at most, brilliant in the morning twilight (the sun rose some fifty minutes later), the flash of light was probably a distant meteor. No evidence for a spaceship could be found.

ASTRONOMY

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars".

By JAMES STOKLEY

THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the western sky this evening as darkness falls is your evening planet, Venus. It is now drawing near the west point of an earthbound observer.

What you see is the planet Venus, now reaching its most prominence, which comes just before its disappearance from the evening sky in 1956.

Venus is far brighter than any other planet, and it is no difficulty in identifying it. Indeed, it can be observed low before the sky is dark. In fact, if you know where to look, you can even see it in broad daylight.

On Nov. 14, Venus has gradually been drawing to the east of the sun. That means that it will be followed the sun in its daily motion across the sky, and so remained visible in the west after the sun has set. On Nov. 18 it will be farther east of the sun, hence remaining visible in the sky for the longest time after sunset.

Because of its early setting, Venus does not appear on the accompanying star chart their appearance about 10:00 p.m. your own kind of standard time, at the first of November, 9:00 p.m. on the 15th and 8:00 p.m. on the 20th.

Bright Birds in the Sky

These map charts, however, show the area toward the west. Dense, at the top of the "northern crown" which is really part of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. Deneb in the bird's tail is, in fact, the most prominent star in this region. Below it represents the wings, and the lower part of the cross has long been considered one of the most beautiful in the night. At the head is Albireo, a star of the second magnitude on the astronomical brightness scale. Below Cygnus is another first-magnitude star, Vega, in Lyra, the harp, which is one of the most brilliant stars in the sky, with the star Altair.

High in the south you can see the four stars that form the great square of the constellation of Pegasus, the winged horse. Although these are not among the brightest, their characteristic arrangement makes them easily recognizable. The map shows which is to find other groups. The horse actually, is upside down in the sky, as the row of stars extending westward from the lower right corner of the square is its head!

The star at the upper right, Alpheratz, is

not in Pegasus at all, but in the neighboring group of Andromeda, which represents the Ethiopian princess who, according to mythology, was chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea monster, represented by the constellation of Cetus, the whale.

Andromeda's mother, Cassiopeia, is seen in the north, a gaudy formula, her form being marked by five bright stars forming a "W" shape. What is generally considered to be the first constellation in the sky, mainly in the clear sky of the season.

This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized because of the three stars in a row known as his belt. To the left is Betelgeuse, to the right's Night, both of the first magnitude, although Betelgeuse is perhaps the only star they do not appear as bright as they will be in the coming months. Then you will be them high in the south. Just above Orion is Taurus, the bull, with brilliant Aldebaran, and to the left of this figure stands Auriga, the charioteer, with the bright star Capella.

Although only the sun is now visible in the southwest before sunrise, the brightest star in the southern sky before sunrise is Jupiter, in the constellation of Virgo. It is close to the bright star Spica. However, it exceeds the star in brightness.

Farther east is Mars, rising about an hour and a half off the sun. In brightness it is about half that of Spica. Mercury and Saturn are both too near the sun to be easily visible in November.

November "Stars" to Come

November is the month bringing one of the year's famous showers of meteors, or "shooting stars", which appear from about the 13th to the 16th.

They are most numerous after midnight, because then we are on the forward edge of the earth in its annual movement around the sun. Thus, we meet them head-on. This is different from the evening hours when we are on the rear part, and see only those that catch up to us.

NEW ORLEANS, NOV. 5--(UP)--THE U.S. COAST GUARD CUTTER SEBAGO
REPORTED IT SPOTTED A BRILLIANT FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKY THIS MORNING
ABOUT 200 MILES SOUTH OF THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED AT 5:10 A.M.; THE
COAST GUARD SAID. RADAR CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT WAS RETAINED INTERMITTENTLY FROM 5:10 A.M. TO 5:37 A.M., WITH THE OBJECT VISIBLE TO THE
NAKED EYE FOR THREE SECONDS BEGINNING AT 5:21 A.M.
A RADIO REPORT FROM THE SEBAGO, ON DUTY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, SAID
THE OBJECT "RESEMBLED A BRILLIANT PLANET" AND WAS TRAVELING AT A
HIGH RATE OF SPEED.
THE "PLANET" TRAVELED IN CONCENTRIC CIRCLES AROUND THE SHIP,
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, AND WAS LAST TRACKED 175 MILES FROM THE
VESSEL. AT THAT TIME, IT WAS HEADED NORTHWARD TOWARD THE LOUISIANA
COAST.
THE COAST GUARD IN NEW ORLEANS SAID IT IS ALERTING SHIPS TO KEEP
A WATCH FOR THE OBJECT, WHOSE WHIRLING FLIGHT COVERED AT LEAST 175
MILES DURING THE 27 MINUTES IT WAS TRACKED BY THE SEBAGO.
IN NORTH LOUISIANA, FOUR PERSONS TOLD STATE POLICE THEY SIGHTED

NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1957

Streaking 'Planet' on Cutter's Radar
Coast Guard Ship in Gulf Sees Strange Light

WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (A)—
A brilliant mystery object was
sighted and tracked by the
Southern skies by a Coast
Guard cutter, even as the Air
Force investigated a flurry of
similar sightings.

The object was seen in the
Sebago, cruising in the Gulf of
Mexico 200 miles south of New
Orleans, and described as re-
sembling "a brilliant planet
with a rate of speed" was
seen for three seconds at
5:21 a.m.

The Coast Guard headquarters
in New Orleans said the message
did not report exactly who on
board the cutter had seen the
object.

Sebago's message said the
object was tracked on the
vessel's radar screen for three
seconds during that period.

Object Called
Part of Missile
Lands in Egypt

CAIRO, Egypt, Nov. 5 —
A mysterious flaming object
bounced into the yard of
Alexandria University today.
Russian scientists who rushed
to the scene from the atomic
energy commission here identi-
fied it as part of a short-range
missile.

The object, there is no men-
tion of its size, was made of
an inch-thick, was made of
white, rubber and had three
lenses.

Police from the object were
extinguished by police.

No planes were flying over
Alexandria at the time and the
object bounced into the school
yard and no one saw where
it came from.

flitted on and off the screen
several times.

The Air Force said that
have been reported from which
scattered sections of the United
States since Sunday, most of
them near secret military in-
stallations in the Southwest.

The Air Force said the radar
network of the Air Defense
Command is keeping watch
so far with no results—and
the Defense Department inves-
tigators have been assigned to
look into the reports.

For several years the Air
Force has checked all reports of
unidentified flying objects. In-
vestigators work under the Air
Defense Command at Colorado
Springs and report to the Air
Technical Intelligence Center.

As to Flying Saucers:
During the first half of this
year, the Air Force said, only
about 250 reports of flying
sightings of flying saucers and
other fantastic aerial objects
have wound up in the "unknown" category.

Though not all flying saucer
buffs may agree—that is con-
ceded—the Air Force's expla-
nation is made up of the things
you read about in science fiction magazines.

Balloons, aircraft and such
things are the source of most
of the Air Force's official ex-
planation set up to investigate
flying saucers and such said
the current rash of reported
sightings. But retired Marine
Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, direc-
tor of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phe-
nomena, added that the re-

ported objects may be some-
thing from another planet.

"These objects," Keyhoe
said, "they would be secret
weapons made on earth or are
interplanetary." Any nation
with the secret military intel-
ligence could have conven-
tional aircraft or missiles.

"I look at things from the
standpoint of the possibility,"
he said one source of power
for such reported objects could
be cosmic energy.

Some of the citizens, peace
officers and service men who
reported sighting mystery ob-
jects since the week end are
convinced they saw something
that caused radio to fade.

James Stokes, an engineer at
the Air Force Missile Develop-

ment Center at Alamogordo,

N. M., reported ten autos were
stalled yesterday on a desert
highway between Alamogordo
and the White Sands Proving
Grounds.

He reported seeing a round-
ish, "brilliant colored, opa-
lescent" object moving errati-
cally across the country-
side and left a sort of haze
like radiation from a giant sun lamp, in its wake.

Leonard Hardnind, chief en-
gineer for the National In-
ventors Council here, said a
device that could neutralize
or other mechanical equipment
in one of the things the armed

AF Radar Hunts Mystery Objects
By the United Press.

The Air Force said today that its radar network has been tracking several "space ships" that have sparked a flurry of "space talk" reports from the Gulf of Mexico, Texas and New Mexico.

The latest report came from a Coast Guard craft from Corpus Christi which kept a brilliant flying object in its binoculars at night.

The Coast Guard sentry reported that the object was traveling at high speed.

For 25 minutes, the radar was tracking "a brilliant plane." There were radar sightings at Steins, Ariz., and other points which caused some excitement.

Here are various other reports of unidentified objects:
• A report from Levelland

Tex., that several persons had sighted an egg-shaped object about 300-feet long which slowed with a reddish color.

An electronics engineer near Portales, N. Mex., said an object near which caused his car radio to fade and his engine to die. Other New Mexico residents also reported seeing the object.
