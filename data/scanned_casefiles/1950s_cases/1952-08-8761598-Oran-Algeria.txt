LUMINOUS OBJECTS SEEN OVER ALGERIA -- Oran, Oran Republican, 16 Aug 52

In Ain Sefra, on the night of 12 August 1952, a railroad agent observed a ball of fire suddenly appearing against a background of clouds, racing across the sky from east to west and leaving behind a luminous pin trail. Apparently increasing in volume, the object stopped suddenly, became bright red, and seemed to explode, but the observer did not hear any noise.
