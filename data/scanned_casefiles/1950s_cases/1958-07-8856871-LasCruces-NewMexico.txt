Transcription of the text in the document:

Report of Unidentified Objects
Sighted in Neighborhood of Berenda on July 15, 1958.
(per U.S.A.F. Headquarters wire of July 15)

These objects were quite possibly fireballs or some other natural phenomena (but the descriptions do not indicate this). The objects were large, close, and moving in curious ways which suggest something other than natural explanations - it is hard to say just what the objects were.

The varied and erratic directions would, of course, rule out any chance of the being connected with any single guided aircraft or missile. It is interesting to note that we have there somewhat similar incidents.

Location: Las Cruces, N.M.
July 25: 03:27 U.T.
Chapel Hill, N.C. August 4: 01:15

Object changed from white to yellow and was almost one-fourth the size of the moon. The object in Las Cruces apparently disappeared suddenly at this time. All were travelling in a more or less easterly direction.

It is the fact that the two time intervals between the "first" and "last" sightings, as given in the report, indicate some possible relationship, although the Chapel Hill sighting came about 10 days later. The Chapel Hill sighting can also be considered as being of the same general type reported from Las Cruces, although the time interval and direction of travel preclude the possibility of the same object being observed at both places. The Chapel Hill sighting, which lasted only three minutes, also seems to correspond with other such "short duration" UFO reports.

Dear Captain:

The item on the eve of my departure for Moscow, and I am taking up my departure for the impression, first given my visit which it was on 27 July.

I honestly don't know which of the alternatives to give greater credit: certainly a possibility. I do not favor it myself very much, as a large saucer sighted according to observer who observed it.

Apropos of that, Dr. "XXXXX" called me just yesterday to report that the date on his letter is as follows: 3:27 UT (Zebra) July 25, 1958; 8:27 Mountain Time. An examination of the data (that is much more convincing, and omitting sparks as it went along) was first sighted at 12:00 am (EDT) on July 25, 1958, at a point approximately 10 miles ESE of Las Cruces, New Mexico, covered the 180 degrees in about 20 seconds, thus giving a speed of approximately 12,000 mph. This object was reported by 4 separate and reliable observers. The object departed on a trajectory toward the southeast.

It is too fast for a satellite unless the object were a foreign satellite. For instance, the Soviet satellites are going at the rate of 17,400 mph. Several people saw it, so I do not see how it could be a figment of imagination. However, until we have definite evidence that it was not a satellite, I would still consider that a possibility. How-ever, the slow-moving objects that intelligence has recently reported, I think are probably genuine, and even the very bright slow-moving objects, because intelligence data at a later date may reveal that some strange things were up there.
