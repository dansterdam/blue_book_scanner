Dear Allen:

Are these things going? 
Enclosed is a copy of a letter from a logistician who thought he detected what he called "a slight deviation from normal" on the trajectory of the satellite going over his station recently.

I thought you might be interested to take a look at this - I don't know what to make of it myself. However, we have made a study of it here, and with the "errors" due to station errors and other factors, it would seem that there is little or no basis for inferring anything unusual. 

Yet the writer seems quite exercised about the matter and thinks it should be checked. What do you think? Any comments?

I hope all is going well with you - I would appreciate hearing from you when you have a moment.

With cordial regards,

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

Saturn Visible in South
Along with Venus and Jupiter, which will be visible in the eastern sky in the early evening, and Saturn in the southern sky that will continue to be seen through the night, Saturn has been well placed for observation during the past several months.
By James Stokley
Although Saturn is always an object of great interest to astronomers, during the past summer it has been unusually well placed in the evening sky for observation. This planet, which is the second largest in the solar system and known to have a marvelously complex ring system, reaches its farthest point north in its annual orbit around the sun each August, and this year it so happened that it reached maximum northern declination on August 20.
Together with Venus and Jupiter, Saturn was easily observable in the southern sky in the early evening hours throughout the summer months. This brings an opportunity for detailed study of Saturn and its rings which may lead to further understanding of this strange and fascinating planet.

Observers Reports
Several amateur astronomers have reported unusual atmospheric phenomena observed in the vicinity of Saturn during the past few weeks. These observers, located in widely separated parts of the country, have described seeing "strange objects" in the area immediately around the planet, apparently unconnected with the ring system. 
Additional observations are being made in an effort to secure more definite information concerning the nature and cause of these phenomena. It is hoped that further study may lead to an explanation of these unusual sightings.

SAUCER OVER RIO DE JANEIRO ON AUGUST 22, 1957:

According to reports received by the D.N.P.A.E.E. (National Department of Aerial Exploration) and another clipping. This time at about 14:35 on 22 August 1957, a strange object was sighted over a great altitude over the Guanabara Bay, by a considerable crowd that looked up and observed it remain stationary for about 10 minutes, and then move away rapidly in a southerly direction. 

The object as described by a passenger looked like a round bath tub or a ball, transparent like of glass or luminous metal (sic). Passengers reckoned the thing to be really 15 times as great as a normal civil airliner. It was circled by 2 or 3 other objects which then the body would be 20 feet wide or more. 

Also in Palo XV people crowded in the pier to watch the same object. Saucers sightings occur frequently in Pao Brazil. The object moved very slowly at first, then increased its altitude and disappeared.

NO CASE (Information Only)

23 August 1957

On the evening of 23 August 1957, at about 8:45 p.m., near Whittier, California, witnesses reported watching a remarkable display of UFOs. Among the witnesses was Mr. Frank A. Little, who related the details of what he had observed.

According to Mr. Little, he and his wife were in the back yard of their home early in the evening, when his wife told her mother "There are two eyes looking at me from the sky!" Mrs. Little went on to explain that she had seen two bright, round objects in the sky. Directly behind them were two jets, recognizable by their exhaust trails.

The time was about 8:45 p.m. Thinking there was a chance that the UFOs might return, Mr. Little returned to the house and got his binoculars. Upon returning, a brilliant, shiny object, about a 60-minute objective or size, was observed. Mr. Little pointed up: "Here come the suckers up there, Mr. Little," and the object began approaching slowly from the southeast. Someone else called out: "Look straight up - there's a whole fleet of them!" Actually, several objects were visible near the zenith, some traveling in a circular motion around the zenith; this continued for about five minutes.

The six objects were grouped in pairs: two to the east of the zenith, two to the west, and the remaining two to the south. Although they were hovering, a motion apparently intended to maintain their relative positions, all six objects then began revolving in a circular motion around the zenith. This continued for about five minutes. As the objects revolved, they emitted a bluish-white light which illuminated the surrounding area. At one point, the light was so bright that it blinded the observers temporarily, and the objects were no longer visible.

When the objects finally began moving away, they did so at a moderately slow speed - two made a right angle to the east, the other four moved to the north as a group. Mr. Little estimated their speed to be about 200-400 mph. After they had gone, when the observers saw the color change from a silver to a red, then orange, glow. The color change began at the base of the "mushroom-shaped" top. The light at the top of the upper structure "flashed" as they departed.

At this point, the disc-centered on the cross hairs of the telescope at the time-mentioned previously. Looking up, Mr. Little saw that it had vanished entirely from view. The rest of the observers confirmed that ALL of the objects had disappeared with a slight dimming of the light, some 15 to 20 seconds before they were out of sight. (Comment: No photograph).

While the objects were visible, the serial number 65-15556 was seen on the side of one of them - it was plainly visible and easily read. This, however, elicited no "no comment" reply.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a detailed description of a UFO sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

They are indebted to CSI-members Idabel Epperson and Jackie Sanders, who obtained the original details directly from the two families interviewed at the site. In addition, they interviewed who spotted the object as she was watering her lawn.

Mrs. Eugene Jones, who was in the back yard of her home, a mile away, when she noticed three round objects in the sky. According to her statement, she was having a barbecue supper when they saw what they thought "were three airplanes but upon closer examination they apparently sighted three round objects, as described in detail by other observers, that were hovering at 10,000 feet or less.

Mr. Don L. Rogers, who lives in Riverside--6 miles away. He was with his little daughter watching planes in the sky when they beheld the aerial maneuver. 

One intriguing aspect of this affair--and perplexing as well--is the reported abrupt disappearance of the object. The examination scene described in detail by the observers indicates no evidence of landing, departure or unorthodox behavior.

The first-seen sighting--took place near LaFayette, New York in May, when a group of persona saw a large, metallic cylinder with sharply pointed ends, poised motion-less in the air for several minutes. After watching the phenomenon--it suddenly made a sharp noise and disappeared from view--for several minutes, it reappeared, hesitately moving away.

SAUCERS OVER LYTHIA, GENYA

COPY is also indebted to Dr. Olavo Fontes by the following items about saucers:

The "Ouro P. Preto" metallurgy school "told the pupils the saucers were seen over the school; they saw a very bright circular light, hovering close to the ground. 61 students and 3 teachers saw it' (time 18.30 (6:30 PM) as they were leaving the school)."

They sent a description of the saucer: "It was circular, about the size of a car, from which emanated a bright white light that illuminated the whole area around it." The saucer stayed there for 6 minutes and then took off at great speed.

This incident "was also reported by more than 20 persons (students, teachers and other townspeople)"...

The document then goes on to describe other UFO sightings and related information.

Text from the document:

"Olavo Fontes from Rio de Janeiro, kindly sent a clipping corroborating the case of a disc-like object seen over Palm Springs, California on August 21 by DA Grimshaw. The clipping says: "A big luminous body, possibly a flying disc, leaving a bright trail disappeared near the airport. Among the witnesses are Messrs Auguste Aram, 45, and his wife, Suzanne, 38, both of Palm Springs, who were driving near the highway. They reported seeing the object in the sky for 2 to 3 minutes until it disappeared. The sighting occurred near the Our Lady of Guadalupe church (Saturday was August 31st. Ed.)."
"OPDV is also indebted to Dr. Olavo Fontes by the following items about saucers:
"From "O Globo" September 5th - "Roberto Augusto Menescal Campos, a student of the Astronomical Observatory of Rio de Janeiro, said that he saw in the sky on September 3rd. at about 5:15 PM, a disc-like object, which for a moment stopped and then flew away at a dizzy speed. He described it as a star-like object though its light was opalescent and its speed was tremendous."
It was also reported that on the morning of August 24th., at 10:00 AM, witnesses in Tamaraneiba, the CSDCANI (Civilian Saucer Investigation Center) observed a strange object in the sky for two or three minutes. It was described as a disc-like object yellowish in color, with a central dark spot."
"This was the second time that this object was reported. The first sighting was on July 24th about the same time - two similar objects were seen over the Pedro Alanso area. These objects described a horizontal, straight line of flight."
"Our next topic will be the confirmation of the saucers aforementioned seen over the town of Minas Gerais on August 29th. A man and woman reportedly saw a saucer at 15:30 (3:30 GMT) saw a saucer coming from the north. Let us plot it over a map and see what happens."

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a typed document with text describing an incident that occurred on August 31, 1957 in Victoria, Brazil. The text mentions that Dr. Olavo Fontes from Rio de Janeiro kindly sent a "clipping corroborating the sighting over Victoria" on that date. The text provides details about the sighting of strange "aircraft-like" objects over the Convent of Penha, with great speed and maneuvers. It also mentions the names of several individuals involved, including Jose Carlos Rodrigues Vale, Silvio Romero Castro, and others.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
30 AUGUST 1957
VICTORIA, BRAZIL

Dr. Olavo Fontes from Rio de Janeiro kindly sent a clipping corroborating the sighting over Victoria on August 31 by three persons: the Vicar Reverend Jose Carlos Rodrigues Vale, Silvio Romero Castro and others. The strange round "aircraft-like" craft flew very low over the Convent of Penha, and with great speed performed strange maneuvers. According to the witnesses, the sighting lasted about 10 minutes. The vicar house these days took care of Mary (Saturday was August 31st).

Dear Capt. - 
They have you right up to date on the incident in this case. We haven't heard anything more about it. What I they conclude to explain the acceleration is being checked into from what they received by teletype. 
Over Salton sea, short distance and good look. They said "objects" were of a highly metallized nature, they were accelerated at a high rate of speed on a course of about 20 degrees south to north, and disappeared. We too have not been notified that they were identified. But E.T. should have no difficulty locating them. Unfortunately, all military and so your sighting.

STATE COLLEGE, NEW MEXICO
16 Sept. 1947

Dr. John S. Greene
216 N. Calle Santa Rosa
Palm Springs, California

Dear Dr. Greene:

Thank you for the communication of your very interesting observation. Evidently, it was no known astronomical object. If it is remarkable that an object of small angular dimensions would be visible from so great a distance, the appearance is of some high tension arc source not of its own and not reflection of any light.

Unfortunately, I was not home when you tried to call. I made a trip to Albuquerque on some official business, if could have been visible from here it would have been a great help to measure its height by parallax. 

Until the final study of your very fine observation by some friendly observers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts, I am sure that your continued observation will somewhat more disclose other information on sight. Until we have a sympathetic and free study of such reports, I am sure that their analytical work may be able to establish the nature of the object you witnessed certainly ought to receive some scientific analysis. If some other observer within 100 miles also saw it, it would provide valuable information on height, absolute magnitude, etc.

Enclosed is a copy of an account of the strangest sight I have ever witnessed. You may keep it.

Sincerely yours,

CLYDE W. TOMBAUGH
ASTRONOMER
