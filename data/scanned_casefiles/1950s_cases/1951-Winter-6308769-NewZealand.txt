Witness observed cloud approximately 500 yds long, 500 yds wide, 60 yds high to east of his location. From cloud at the north end only a piece of cloud suddenly detached itself. Cloud gave appearance of whirl wind and travel north for a short distance. Then at right angle in easterly direction. The main bulk of the cloud remain motionless and was not immediately disturbed by action of the wind. The small cloud was not indicative spherical, but form so during travel to the N and E. Disappeared over the sea, 4 miles to the East.

and am now only out in the open spaces
only at work ends where I cultivate and
grow potatoes and wheat with my tractor
and implements

I also enclose newspaper photographs
of Christchurch and Kaiapoi districts
giving you an indication of the
area which could not be affected by
sudden currents of air as would happen
in mountainous country.

Yours sincerely,

P.S. A few weeks ago some aerial
top crossing pilots at New Plymouth N.Z.
reported a formation of circular planes
travelling as they were proceeding out to
operate at top morning. I will endeavour
to get "press" clippings - and forward.

NOTE -

I enclose these letters to show to you that my attention at this time was not on unidentified yet flying saucers. I do not even submit the photographs to the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the parties most desirous mentioned in my previous correspondence at that time. Although in 1954 when I received the reports from the photographic supplies shop, I showed them to workmen at the engineering works where I work, 98% of them decided that it was a flying saucer or something like that. I was the only person other than the photographic dealer to have the prints and negatives in 1951.

Please return letters at your convenience

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a low-contrast black and white photograph or illustration showing what seems to be a landscape or cityscape with buildings and trees, but the details are very difficult to discern due to the poor image quality.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your letter of 2 March 1954, together with photographs, has been received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center for analysis.

A study of the photographs indicates that the object shown is a lenticular altocumulus cloud. This type of formation occurs in suits from the atmospheric conditions which you described.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center would like to obtain the use of your negatives, if you still have them on hand, for the purpose of making enlargement prints. The negatives would be promptly returned to you.

Your interest in the unidentified flying object program and your desire to be of service is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

During the winter 1951 I was on site of a building on my section at Kaiapoi at the time was approximately 11 a.m. The sky was cloudless but one cloud of approximately 600 yds long and 100 yds wide and 60 yds high (approximate estimates only) was about the height in an easterly direction from my position.

Out of this cloud came, at the north and only one, successively detaching free of cloud that we are in photographs. I watched this white/find white wing of cloud travel north for a short distance, then at right angle

as in photography, but when which wind
was in the making, the above that formed the
sphere was only a small part of the breath and
of cloud. The main bulk of the cloud seemed
almost motionless and was not immediately
disturbed by the action of wind.
The main bulk of cloud drew off at about
one hour later, afterwards, just as a cloud
of steam drifting from a railway engine.
The small piece of cloud that of much
whiteness was not immediately spherical in
shape but formed as drawing its short distance
mostly then cut with tremendous velocity
as wisps of cloud was whirled around at an angle
and to about 85° // then tilted to
horizontal with change to easterly direction and
disappearance of that elevation. But to see a distant
of approximately four miles.
I formed the opinion that no aircraft
encountering such a swift wind of cloud would
survive to tell the tale as the vicious velocity

off the white winds tremendous power as forced
by the way winds of cloud were streaked
around during the formation as seen in
photographs.

For some years I thought that
I had only witnessed a white wind.
I am more certain that the remainder of
the cloud remained almost motionless before
dissolving inwards some time afterwards as
atom then. The cloud was just an ordinary
atmospherical cloud.

However, I forward you the snaps
hoping that although over two years and one half
have passed that they will be of interest.
Perhaps some novel, remarkable scenario,
or pilot may have witnessed a similar sight,
and you may compare notes.

I would appreciate your opinion of the
photographs.

Yours faithfully,

[Recipient's location and name are redacted]

Dear [Redacted]:

Your recent letter of 2 March 1954 addressed to the United States Air Force has been received with interest.

You may be assured that if the information you submitted is of intelligence value, it will be forwarded to the analysis. However, as you can probably imagine, there are so many sightings and pictures received by the USAF that it is not possible to comment on all sightings that are reported to us.

Many thanks again for keeping us in mind.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Sir,

Today I received your letter dated
20th April 1954. I have at once
immediate forwarding of negatives
which I have always had at my home at
Kaiapoi.

I am a single man and live alone.
Prior to World War II I had apart the whole
of my working life either on the land in the
mountains and flat country in both North and
South Islands of New Zealand. I have not
seen a similar whirlwind before or since.
I now work as a farm overseer in an
engineering and implement factory in both
