S.S. "Noomeral"                                      UNCLASSIFIED                                   Captain:

On Passage Port Lincoln to Melbourne
Via Backstairs Passage

REPORT ON OBSERVATION OF PHENOMENON

Observers:-                                           Position:- Lat.    36-35 S.
                Second Officer                                  Long.   138-54E.
                Chief Engineer                                  Course  142 True.
                Fifth Engineer                                  Speed   9.5 Knots.

Weather:
        Wind. South. Force 2, Bar. 29-98" Air. Temp. 78. Sea. Temp. 64.

Refraction: Abnormal.    Cloud. Alto Cumulus 2/3. Height. 10,000 feet.
                        Visibility. Plus Thirty miles.

At 1400 Hrs. G.M.T. 5th. February 1958 Whilst in the above
position a contrail was observed to form at about 50 degrees altitude and
bearing 290 degrees from the ship. The contrail developed rapidly passed
over the vessels zenith and faded out at about 40 degrees altitude and
bearing 110 degrees again reformed at about 30 degrees and finally
disappeared at an altitude of about 15 degrees on the same bearing, and in
a direction over the township of Kingston.

The contrail appeared to originate from some fast moving body
and the height was estimated at plus 50,000 feet. The contrail remained
visible for some thirty minutes gradually dispersing with the effluction of
time, it was white in colour.

The second officer likened the contrail to the trails left by
V.2. rockets when launched having observed such launchings from the North Sea
during 1944.

Abnormal refraction was noted at the time of observation, the
s.s. "Lake Eyre" bound on an opposite course was first observed well below the
horizon and the image of this vessel was seen to be inverted. Later as two
images, gradually fading as the vessel came hull up on the horizon.
