WATERTOWN DAILY TIMES     THURSDAY AFTERNOON, NOV. 10, 1955

LETTERS
From the People
To The Times:
    I wish to express my heartfelt
thanks to the voters and the peo-
ple of the eighth ward who
worked and supported me in
electing me as their representative
on the board of supervisors.

    My good wishes are also ex-
tended to my opponent, August D.
Naccari, for the fine sportsmanship and gentle manner in which
he conducted his campaign.
                    Steve D. A....
                    Watertown, N. Y., Nov. 10, 1955

Makes Statement
To The Times:
    The people of Watertown have
honored me by this election and
I am mindful of the trust they
have placed in me and of the
challenges that lie ahead. At
the present, I assure you with
the honesty and sincerity I possess
that my entire actions will be
based upon the best interests of

the eighth ward will be held next summer.
    It is impossible for me to know
everybody who has had a part in
this success but I want to express
to everyone my deepest appreciation for all your hard work and
untiring efforts in my behalf.

    With certain always remembering and cherishing your loyalty.

    To my many friends who have
supported Bill, I want to say
special word of praise. You have
supported with complete devotion
a candidate and a cause that was
just and proper and you have
made me very happy by a good,
clean, hard fought campaign and
would welcome your hand of
friendship and your cooperation
to make Watertown the best city
in the entire country.

    Any success I might have will
be because of the cooperation of
all of the people.
                W. G. Lachenauer
                Watertown, N. Y., Nov. 10, 1955

More Flying Saucers
To The Times:
    The flying saucers are back!
The points of a photograph taken
Thursday, Nov. 3, I received
this morning from a local photographer in preparation for the 25th

smaller bridge across the lake at
Edwardsville from Booth's Island,
looking toward Hevelton. Peculiarly above the bridge is the
flying saucer, which looks like a
metal word or plate. Oddly
enough, I did not notice anything
when I took the picture, although
there had been some jet airplanes
in the locality that afternoon.

    This picture, which was taken
between 2 and 3 that afternoon,
is now in the process of being
enlarged.

    Do any of your readers remember any mysterious objects in
that area that afternoon? If you wish this picture for
publication, please so inform
Malcolm A. Booth, Historian,
Town of Morristown,
Hammond, N. Y., Nov. 5, 1955
