THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT SOMETHING WAS SEEN: HOWEVER, THE PRESENCE OF INVERSION CONDITIONS, THE FACT THAT OBJECT REMAINED IN ONE LOCATION FOR OVER AN HOUR, AND THAT SIMILAR SITTINGS WERE OBSERVED IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE AREA CAUSES ME TO SUSPECT THE PAGE IS PROBABLY UNCLASSIFIED.
SITTINGS WERE CAUSED BY SURFACE LIGHTS BEING REFLECTED OFF THE INVERSION LAYER.

2573 AB 34, ELLINGTON AFB, TEXAS
were sighted by separate individuals in the Houston metropolitan area within a period of three hours prior to the sightings by the law enforcement officers. 3. Object appeared to be round and about the size of a dime. It alternately had a brilliant and dull glow with colors of red, green, white. Only one object was seen; the bottom of which seemed to be rotating giving off predominantly a red glow and alternating to green and white. No other unusual features were noted. There was no sound, trail, or exhaust.
Sheriff Bales' attention was directed to the object by its brightness. It was at a forty-five degree angle of elevation southwest of his position. It appeared to be quite high, above ten thousand feet. The object did not move except up and down. It remained visible for about an hour and then the officer's duties required him to discontinue watching it. The officer watched it with both naked eyes and binoculars. Object was sited initially at 10:55 25 AUG 65 under clear night time conditions. The following weather conditions were noted during the time of sighting: Winds - surface, calm; 6000 ft./variable; 10,000 ft. variable: 16,000 ft. 50 degrees at 15 knots; 20,000 ft. variable at 5 knots: 20,000 ft. variable at 5 knots: above 30,000 ft, not available. Temperatures: surface, 72°; 6000 ft, 15°; 10,000 ft, 9°; 16,000 ft. 2°; 20,000 ft, minus 3°; 20,000 ft, minus 30°, 50,000 ft, minus 59°. Sky conditions: high scattered clouds, eleven miles visibility. Other weather remarks: Inversion at approx 1500 to 1500 ft; haze and smoke in all quadrants north-northeast south line.

The text in the document reads:

2379 AB SQ, ELLINGTON AFB, TEXAS
west of these 6,000 to 10,000 feet no weather balloons were
released from local area. Investigation: Houston Museum of
Natural Science cannot offer any celestial explanation for
observation. Local AGC radar and Houston International Tower
radar reported no unusual sightings. Houston Tower radar reported
minor anonymous propagation indicating the presence of an inversion.
Remarks: This siting caused considerable interest by local news
media. Conclusion: Preliminary investigation failed to uncover
any facts substantiating the presence of an unknown object. There
is no question in my mind that something was seen; however, the
presence of inversion conditions, the fact that object remained
in one location for over an hour, and that similar sightings were
observed in other sections of the area cause me to suspect the
sightings were caused by surface lights being reflected off the
inversion layer.
