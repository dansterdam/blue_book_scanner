30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

Aug. 17 2h at about 8.20 P.M. My wife and I were standing in front of our house here when we saw a little light in the sky, flying very slow and just going straight on. It seemed about the size of a silver dollar and was a round white object very bright, in the sky. We called our next door neighbors who were not at home at the time and we did not make contact with them. For a few seconds, there was a disappearance and it was about 15 or 20 seconds later . The other one was light and very high. They were very bright and we agreed that they were definitely not air planes."
