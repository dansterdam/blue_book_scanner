sky. It appeared to be fast moving and climbing at the time.
He estimated the object was headed SE in the direction of this
Alaskan peninsula and was sighted later at Unalaska and
St. Michael about 150 miles across Norton Sound from Nome.
It description of the object is sketchv and vague.

2030 - Received a call from a Major O'Brien, HQ USAF calling ATIC's
attention to press release states 2020 reporting of a
mysterious object crossing Alaska from direction of Soviet
Siberia. Object was cylinder shaped, traveling at high rate
of speed (2,000 feet alt) and was sighted at two points. Major
O'Brien stated that he had called Alaska and that a special
team was working on the sighting. Major O'Brien suggested ATIC
should have AFOIN examined as it may hold data.

2035 - Called Mr. ... and related above. Asked availability to a
USAF which would be able to obtain full copy of Mr release from
local paper sources. Mr. ... stated he would contact
Washington paper sources.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: INF

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: Secretary of the Air Force (SAFOI-3)
Washington 25, D.C.

1. On Sunday 14 February 1960 an unidentified flying object was sighted in the sky between Nome and Unalakleet, Alaska by a number of civilians and reported to this Headquarters through 11th Air Division (D), Ladd Air Force Base. Immediate investigation was begun and reported in accordance with AFR 200-2.

2. The Office of Information, Headquarters, Alaskan Air Command, was notified as to whether or not these sightings had been reported and the information was given that they had. News media within the Alaskan area contacted this Headquarters indicating interest in the reports that had been received. The resulting press story was so written it left an inference that an object had been sighted by the Air Force presumably by radar.

3. A detailed investigation by this Headquarters revealed that the object sighted was identified as a meteor. Ladd Air Force Base, through its operational detachment of the 4th Weather Wing, had monitored and recorded its passage, and the identity of the object was so intense we publicly released the fact that it was a meteor.

4. With reference to the letter from Mr. ******* (Attachment 3), the Chief of Staff of this Headquarters, initiated correspondence to Mr. ********* Air Force regarding the report of his observation (Attachment 3).

5. In addition to his letter to Colonel Isbeil, Mr. ********* provided the local press with a statement concerning his disagreement with the published identification of this object. (Attachment 4). All subsequent actions regarding this particular sighting will be forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

6 March 1960 an additional unidentified object was reported in the Nome, Alaska area by between Nome and Unalakleet, Alaska, a distance of 85 miles. The pilot and co-pilot of a light aircraft, Casper Hagen, were both flying this aircraft. This pilot was described as being a bright flash seeming to result from an explosion at around 5000 feet altitude, 35 miles south of Nome. Both the pilot and co-pilot reported they saw the flash and saw nothing further - no sound. The only passenger aboard the aircraft was asleep and did not observe or see anything. Two individuals on the ground reportedly saw a flash, a 14 year old girl in Nome, and the town marshal of Nome. Interviews with Nome, Fairbanks, and Anchorage, Alaska were being made by this town and reports are being forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.

6. The initial press inquiry on this latest sighting was received 8 March 1960. The man quoted as reporting this incident to the press was William B. Rodney above whose office of the reports concerning this object. We did confirm the fact to the press that this unidentified object was reported to us and that we have forwarded this report to headquarters, United States Air Force.

Colonel T. J. Isbell 
Commander, 33rd AD 
Seattle, Washington

Dear Colonel Isbell,

Your letter of January 17th, received, and I do appreciate your taking the time to write me. It is rather a disappointment to me to learn that the object which we witnessed on January 7th was not an astronomical engine, however, I have a strange feeling that the object was in some way connected with some kind of a vehicle and that the object was a manned aircraft.

The descriptions given by the various observers are quite similar, and I well recall the relative size and speed of the object as it passed over my home. I wouldn't like to have it be better to deal with it as some kind of a phenomena, but I am quite convinced that what we saw was some kind of a craft of the same type as described in your letter, which moved with great speed and gave off no sound.

I am writing to ask if it would be possible for me to get any additional information, other than that contained in your letter, regarding this incident? There has been some interest from the people of this community, and I feel that any information I could give them would be appreciated.

I fully realize that this was not a too detailed study, and I can well appreciate the difficulties involved in properly identifying some of these things which I am told are fairly common. However, I do feel that the object we saw was a maneuverable craft of some kind, and if there is any additional information that you could give me, I would be most grateful.

Thank you again for your courtesy and cooperation. I will be most pleased to hear from you further.

Sincerely yours,

Explanation of
Mystery Object
Pete Walsh, Nome station
manager for Wien Alaska Airlines, said today he takes exception to a recent Air Force report that a mystery object spotted at Nome last month was a meteor.
Walsh said that on January 26 he observed a bright object travel on a horizontal plane, change course, and then disappear. He said he has written the Air Force challenging its finding.
"I don't believe them (the Air Force) it he said. "Walsh said. siding that "many persons" in Nome saw the object.
He said the Air Force has started its warning area to be on the lookout for more doing of this type.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed document from the Air Technical Intelligence Center of the United States Air Force regarding an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed in Alaska on 15 February 1960.

Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, Alaska, 15 February 1960
1. On 1 February 1960, an object described as "about and rounded, bright in appearance, compared to a bright star" was seen from Unalakleet Alaska at approximately OHOOZ. The object was descending from some distance and disappeared over the city at approximately 0102Z.
2. Of all of the information provided to ATIC concerning an UFO sighting, the most credible is the actual description (not to include size, shape, etc.) from the observer. In this case, the description as relayed from the observer, is approximately as follows:
Direction from the observer: seen from Unalakleet Alaska
Duration of the sighting: estimated to be approximately 120 miles high.
3. The description of this object, the duration of the sighting, and calculated time of the incident led to the conclusion that this object was a meteor.
4. Subsequent to the ATIC conclusion on this case Dr. Christian Elvey, Director of Geophy sics Institute, Alaska University, concluded that the object was a very bright meteor.
5. Other possibilities for the cause of this sighting: 1. ... missiles, satellites, etc. were considered and ruled out due to inconsistencies.
6. ATIC has no information to indicate that any other object was in the area at the time of this sighting, and had no other reports concerning this observation from other sources.

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, TEAM 4, SAFPI

SUBJECT: Alaska UFO Sightings

1. The following information should be used in answering any inquiries regarding the sighting of an unknown object over Nome, Alaska on 6 March 1950.

2. There were two sightings in the Nome-Unalakleet area, the first on 18 February 1950.

3. On 18 February 1950, an object was observed as just a light, and recommended as being a balloon or aircraft. No conclusions were reached.

4. Of all the information provided to ATIC concerning an UFO sighting in the Nome area, this appears to be the only relevant case. The other information was merely reports of some unexplained lights, and it was impossible to determine their nature. Using only these factors, it was possible to develop an approximate 100 mile altitude for the sighting.

5. Subsequent to the ATIC conclusion on this case, Dr. Christian Stager, Director of Geophysical Institute, Alaska University, concluded that this sighting was a very bright meteor.

6. Other possibilities for the cause of this sighting: Very high altitude luminous weather phenomena, too high for jet aircraft.

7. ATIC has no information which indicates that more than one object was seen on this date. All of the data reported were consistent to within five minutes of a single observed object.

Here is the text output from the OCR (optical character recognition) of the document:

On 6 March 1960 an unidentified object was observed in the skies near Unalakleet, Alaska. The report states that the object was seen by two civilians, a pilot, and a co-pilot of a commercial aircraft. The object was described as a "saucer-shaped" craft that was initially observed near the ground, then climbed vertically at a rapid rate of speed before disappearing from view. The object made no sound and displayed no lights. The document indicates that the observation was investigated by the United States Air Force.

The report also mentions that the commanding officer of the 5001st Radar Evaluation Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base concurred with the findings of the investigation. Copies of the letter were forwarded to the Commander, Alaskan Air Command and the Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF.

2 MAR 1950 

The Commanding General:

The sighting on 23 February 1956 of an unidentified flying object observed near Nome, Alaska, is submitted for your consideration. 

On the date and time mentioned, a light was observed hovering over the town of Unalakleet, Alaska, by two reliable witnesses, one of who was a pilot employed by Wien Alaska Airlines. This light appeared to be about 100 feet in diameter and about 200 feet above the ground. It moved slowly in a southerly direction, stopping and starting in an erratic manner. The object finally disappeared in a southwesterly direction.

An investigation was made on the scene and statements were obtained from the witnesses, copies of which are attached. The object was observed for about 15 minutes and was considered to be definitely of an unidentified nature. No aircraft or other known objects could be associated with this sighting. The object was silent and no sound was heard.

On all of the available information relating to this sighting, it appears to have been a UFO of a type not previously reported. It is recommended that this report be forwarded to the ATIC for their consideration as to the possible identification of the object observed.

Respectfully,

G-2, USAF OF ALASKA

A 3:00 p.m. reported to a 3 March, 60 the Nome Territorial police had been notified that a round unidentified object had been observed by several people hovering over the city of Nome at an altitude of about 500-600 feet and for a period of about 20 minutes. The object was at times brightly lighted, then would go dark, and the color varied from white to red to orange.

Several reliable eyewitness statements were obtained as to the size, shape, color, and maneuver characteristics of the object. The statements indicated that the object appeared to be disc-shaped, metallic in appearance, about 40-50 feet in diameter, and at times hovering, then rapidly accelerating and disappearing.

This report has received full investigation and the facts gathered have been evaluated and analyzed. It is our belief that the available evidence does not justify the conclusion that an unidentified flying object was observed on that date in the Nome, Alaska area.

The report indicates that the object was observed by a number of persons, including a Nome Territorial policeman, and was described as hovering or nearly hovering at about 500-600 feet altitude and disappearing rapidly. However, since no photographic or other physical evidence is available, and since the descriptive evidence does not conclusively rule out certain conventional or natural phenomena, the conclusion has been reached that this report does not provide sufficient grounds to establish the presence of an unidentified flying object.

Respectfully yours,
Richard Lehner, Captain, USAF
Commanding, Detachment 5, 73rd Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron

REPLY TO 
ATTN OF:

19 February 1960

SUBJECT:

TO: Mr. Orville H. Spilltt
Director, Office of News Services 
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (PA) 
Department of Defense
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Spilltt:

Attached for your information are copies of news items concerning civilian reports of unidentified flying objects seen over Nome, Unalakleet and other nearby points in Alaska. These civilian reports of a flying object passed in a southeasterly direction were reported to NORAD exactly as received by Alaskan Command. In the process it seems the story was splintered into two separate missile-firing incidents in north-south bound directions, supposedly indicating the conclusion drawn that there were two objects. There is considerable confusion in the minds of those who witnessed the phenomenon and there is certainly no count that many people saw something, but it was not registered on any tracking facilities in this area. There is currently no other information concerning this incident.

Sincerely,
//s// Carlos G. Smith
Lt Colonel, USAF

Object Reported Heading In From The Bering Sea
An unidentified object, believed to be a saucer, was reported over Alaska near Nome late yesterday afternoon.
The object was between 2,000 and 5,000 feet high and moving at a high rate of speed. It was headed southeast, where it would be toward Anchorage.
Pete Walsh of Nome told the Anchorage Times that he saw the object and that it was also seen by radar stations, probably the City and borough stations.
WALSH SAID he believed the object to be a clear, lighted object and the object slanted in the direction it was moving, the article stated. THE OBJECT was as fast as a jet plane. The object was reported to headquarters of the Alaska Command, to the Federal Aviation Agency and to the weather bureau at Washington, D.C.
Capt. M.S. Garrett at Washington, D.C. said it would be difficult to ascertain what the object signified from the information available at this time, according to the article.

Alaska UFO Probe Under Way
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A bizarre object sighted through Western Alaska skies last Sunday baffled Alaska Air Command and was answered in its wake, they said.
Was it a jet plane? It so, a very mysterious one.
The Alaska Air Command hopes to come up with some of the answers today.
The flame-snitching object was reported by several persons from Nome to St. Michael, about 130 miles away. They said it appeared to be traveling from north to south at a tremendous speed and was hurried southeasterly.
The reports were conflicting, Major Roy E. Haines of Ladd Headquarters Air Force Base here, said yesterday.
Some said it was low and slow, some said it was high and fast, he said.
A Pan Alaska Airways employ at Nome, A. Walsh, said the object was traveling 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the earth. He described it as silvery and tubular, some what like a jet plane, with strange flames shooting from it.
Mrs. Stanley Mollor of Nome said "it had the appearance of a large star and was very, very brilliant white." Neither she nor Walsh could tell whether it had wings.
Observers said the mysterious object curved up and away as it approached them.
Some, as it was manned and controlled.

The article goes on to describe the object, stating that the Air Force could not explain it but said it was picked up on radar at Nome, St. Michael, Unalaska, and St. Lawrence Island. The article mentions that the first reports said the object was circular in shape, streaked across the Siberian coast line, and was spotted by Pete Walsh, an airline station manager near there. The article concludes by stating that it headed eastward into Alaska.

Residents
Of Nome 
Not Upset
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP)- The people of Nome, Alaska, are not excited that the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) in Colorado Springs said they had "unconfirmed" reports from civilians saying a flying object had been sighted over Alaska.
"NORAD had received no reports of a flying object from Nome," said the spokesman.
The reports were made to the observation center at Colorado Springs on Sunday evening and were relayed to NORAD, the spokesman said.
"It was registered on 'any military devices such as radar, nothing to excite it,' the spokesman said. "If they wanted to reports a flying object, moving slowly northwest in the direction of Nome, Unalakleet, Alaska."
The second report, also from civilians in the area, said the object "was handled through normal channels" as an unidentified flying object.
The spokesman said that reports on this object from civilian sources at Unalakleet and other areas were being investigated.
"NORAD officials in Colorado Springs said they were merely standing by to be advised of any further reports on the object.
The spokesman said there were no details available on what the object was or its speed or altitude. He said, "If there really was an object there and it wasn't tracked by the radar - it was handled by the control room."

REPORT MADE
BY AMERICAN
AIR DEFENSE
TWO OBJECTS SEEN
EARLY MONDAY IN
SKIES OVER ALASKA

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA (AP) - A spokesman for the Alaskan Air Command said today that unidentified flying objects were observed in the skies over the early Alaskan morning.

The spokesman said at 2 a.m. yesterday the command center at NORAD received reports of two objects in the skies over Nome and Unalakleet, Alaska.

The objects, the spokesman said, were described as bright lights which moved rapidly and silently across the sky. The objects also produced a flash which was observed at Nome, it was reported.

THE SECOND OBJECT was described as a bright light moving at a high rate of speed and finally disappearing from view, the spokesman said.

Whether the objects reported are explainable or are, in fact, unidentified flying objects, officials said, is a subject of the continuing investigation.

Command officials reported that no additional information is available regarding the sighting of the unidentified objects.

THE SIGHTINGS were reported from civilian observers in the Nome and Unalakleet areas, the spokesman said.

THE DENVER POST TUES., FEB. 16, 1960
Alaska Air Command Probes Reports of Silver Object in Sky
ANCHORAGE, Alaska Feb. -The Alaska Air Command at Nome was investigating a flashing, silvery object in western Alaska skies the last two nights. 
Major Roy E. Haines, public information officer at Ladd Air Force Base here, said tonight:
"We have the report and are investigating it. Some people said it looked like a jet plane with flames shooting from the tail."
The Alaska Air Command probed the reports with several persons from Nome and St. Michael about 175 miles across western Alaska.
"It appeared from the direction of Russian Siberia and flashed southeasterly," Haines said.
The reports were conflicting. Some said it appeared to be a jet-propelled object while others described it as a flying saucer-shaped object.
Haines said an investigation was started immediately. He said radar records of the stations north of Nome were to be checked to determine if any planes were in the area at the time.

SECOND ALASKA SIGHTING
For three weeks 
a man and woman sighted a strange object in the sky over Nome, Alaska. On January 13, 1960, at about 6:50 PM, the object was again sighted, this time by a husband and wife, in the sky over Nome. The object was described as a large, shiny, metallic object hovering in the sky. It remained stationary for about 30 seconds and then began to move rapidly, disappearing from sight in about 5 seconds.
The object was also sighted on January 14 and 15, 1960, by several other people in the Nome area, including a pilot who stated the object was similar in appearance to a small airplane, but was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. The sightings were reported to the Air Force.
On January 18, 1960, the object was again sighted over Nome by a woman walking near her home. She stated the object was a large, bright, round object which hovered for several minutes and then disappeared rapidly. This sighting was also reported to the Air Force.
The Air Force stated that the object could not be identified, and that the sightings were unexplained.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

HQ. AAC. 19 February 1960---Reports made public by the Alaskan Air Command indicates the unidentified flying object sighted in the skies in northwestern Alaska last Sunday was an extremely high powered white hot source at very high elevation. It is believed this object was traveling at a much higher speed than any known satellite and due to the tremendous speed, missiles and rockets have been ruled out. These conclusions were forwarded to Headquarters, United States Air Force, by Alaskan Air Command.

Dr. Christian T. Elvey, Director, Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska, and a member of the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, concurred in the findings. These conclusions are based on eye witness sightings at Nome, St. Micheal, Unalakleet, and Holliachuk and systems of triangulation. The meteor was sighted over an area of approximately 180 nautical miles, traveling in a relatively straight line Northwest to Southeast. Sightings were mostly of five to ten seconds duration indicating tremendous speed at a very high altitude in conjunction with the angle and azimuth of observation and disappearance.

Based on the image, there does not appear to be any photograph or image present. The image only shows text from what seems to be a Project Blue Book report.

Extracting the text from the document:

It has definitely been confirmed that this motor was traveling at a much higher speed out of the normal satellite orbit pattern. 

Dr. Elvey stated in his concurrence there is no doubt in his mind that it was never anything other than a white hot meteor traveling at an extremely high speed and at a very high altitude.
