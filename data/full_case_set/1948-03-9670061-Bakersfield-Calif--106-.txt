Incident #106-- Bakersfield, California -- 6 March 1948

While this report taken alone, with allowances made for subjective reporting, could be considered as applying to a disintegrating meteorite, the occurrence of at least three very similar incidents (see # 107, 103, 109) at the same location, over a time interval of a few days, is sufficient to make this hypothesis completely untenable.

The description applies more closely to the "star shell" (a projectile which after disintegration emits a parachute to bring instruments safely to the ground), with which this investigator was familiar during the war, than to anything else.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

  Information from the Sheriff’s office, Bakersfield, California, revealed
that numerous calls from residents in Bakersfield concerning peculiar objects
in the sky over Bakersfield, predicated an investigation by their office and
contact with MCI regarding possible Air Force.

  On 13th March 1948, two informants, Mrs. and Mr. 
stated that they observed a white object which appeared to be 
approximately five by five inches in diameter, about 12 feet above ground suddenly
appeared and disappeared as spontaneously what appeared to be a parachute, 
was down to the drifting to the east.

The object, as described, appeared to be a burning fabric airplane,
consisted in smoke. Observations were made in the Bakersfield object at both
the north and south ends, approximately east to west eight miles distance, around
1500 hours on 5 March 1948.

  On 13th March 1948, in Bakersfield, north on stated that he observed
an object, between 0900 and 1000 during the or approximately flying
miles distance. The object was a large, orang-red ball of fire, somewhat
larger than a small airplane, and appeared to maintain altitude for approximately
three minutes, than dip, rise, as bright orange with the gauges a burning 
hole. A parachute, with a black object hanging was then observed to fall,
drifting to the east until disappeared into the buildings of Bakersfield.

  On 12th March 1948, two informants, Mrs. and laboratory,

laboratories which appeared at first to be a very small airplane. Orange 
and flames seemed to envelop the object with considerable black smoke 
trailing in a zigzag manner for approximately 1000 feet. The 
object was observed it 1,000 feet, approximately due north of Bakersfield,
direction to vanished distant, at approximately 0630 hours.
