DETAILS:

1. This investigation was requested by Col. D. ------, Deputy Chief of Staff, Intelligence, Headquarters Fifteenth Air Force, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Who at approximately 1030 hours, 10 June 1949 verbally advised the io-doc-ument Commander, Investigative attachment, 15th AAF District (IC) that he had received a report that five unidentified objects had been sighted by an employee of C.F & I.C. Works, Pueblo in the vicinity of ----sburg, Colorado during the afternoon of 9 June 1949.

AT TIOGA, COLORADO

2. At approximately 1830 hours, MST, 1 June 1949 the writer contacts Mr and Mrs C. C. ------, Tioga, Colorado in their home (located on Colorado State Highway 99) approximately ten miles west of Coir. and 8 miles east of Gardner, Colorad. Mr. ------ related that a darn strange thing happened this afternoon, I seen five shining silver thin discs high up in the sky. They had told flying in a northeast direction at a terrific rate of speed and I never seen any aerial object that resembled the ones he saw was ornage. What concerned about them. It was then telephone, calls advised the authorities at Lowrv ir Force Base, Denver, Colorado of the situation.

3. On 10 June 1949 at approximately 2000 hours, MST, Mr sighted the pre-farm hand, was interviewed aging at farm. and the objects had airplanes heading in a south on 5 June 1949 he had been working in Six miles to the east the Greeley Highway. When asked if he had noticed anything about the clouds or the sun, he stated that “some times the clouds, in a formation of five echolon with two objects flying parallel to each other in front. The remaining three objects were to the left and rear of the two front objects and were formed in a triangular formation. The flight was at cloud level and flew in and out of the clouds. He noticed that the rear of the cloud back and forth in the rear of the front the echelon. He watched them for approximately fifteen seconds when they flew out of his sight in the clouds. ------ estimated that at the time of sighting they were at about sixty to seventy degree angle from the horizon from him and was to the west of him. He estimated their altitude to be 20,000 feet stating that he figured this altitude when they flew over Greenhorn Feak which is about 13,000 feet in the altitude. (Greenhorn Peak is located almost due north of the place of sighting and is 12354 feet in altitude) The objects were estimated to be about two feet in diameter and appeared to be perfectly round in shape. They were brown in color. Mr ------ stated that they were about the size he would think an A-6 aircraft would be. The direction of flight was from the southwest to the northeast. Due to the altitude, Mr ------ was unable to determine their means of propulsion or support. There was no evidence of any lights or exhaust. Also, the observer could not tell anything about the construction of

the objects. One thing he noticed was the lack of any sound from the objects.
The objects flew in and out of the clouds with no apparent effect on the clouds.
The intensity (?) hand under of his view would have appeared to disturb
the times when they finally room from view in the clouds. The objects first
or than vanishing, again the vehicle had served with the United States Air Force for a
period of approximately four years. During that time he worked in the capacity
of aircraft mechanic for three and one half years. he stated that had the
objects been similar to any standard aircraft, he would have paid little or no
attention to the flight.

4. Concerning: the observer Interviews were held with Mr. and Mrs. G. A.
TAGGARD, Mr. FJMD in PADCSC7, Chief Clerk, Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. at
Tioga, Colorado and Mr CLAUDE SWIFT, Sheriff, Huerfano County, Walsenburg,
Colorado on 11 and 12 June 1949 to determine the same individual. All
were emphatic in their statement that over became excited. Mr TAGGARD
very level headed individual who seldom if was considered to be a
stated that even when the ________told him of the objects he showed no outward
excitement. During dinner with the BARNETTS and Mr the investigating
agent had opportunity to observe Mr for about two hours and was impressed
by his calmness and ability to observe as details.

5. The Terrain: The terrain in the vicinity of the sighting is extremely
hilly being in the feet hills of the San de Cristo range of mountains and
being approximately 10 miles south of the ___ mountain range.

6. On 11 June 1949 attempts were made to locate other individuals in
the vicinity of Tioga and Gardner, Colorado who might have seen the unidentified
objects. These attempts met with negative results.

AT PUEBLO, COLORADO

7. At approximately 1130 hours, MST, 11 June 1949 an interview was held
with Mr ORVILLE FOSTER, Observational Supervisor, US Weather Bureau, Municipal
Airport, Pueblo, Colorado in an attempt to ascertain the weather conditions in
the vicinity of Tioga at the time of the sighting. A check of the reports
revealed that around Pueblo (approximately forty-five miles northwest of the
place of sighting) there was broken sky at 5000 feet with intermittent rain
showers during the afternoon. This report indicates cloud level 5000 ft above surface
which at place of sighting is approximately 7000 feet above sea level, making the cloud
surface approximately 12,000 feet. Winds aloft were north northwest at 10 to
15 miles per hour. Mr FOSTER stated that they had no reports for the area
immediately surrounding the place of sighting; but that the reported condition
was general throughout the area on the east side of the mountains during the
afternoon in question. As far as Mr FOSTER knew there were no observable celestial
phenomena occurring that might have been mistaken for the flight.

8. On 11 June 1949 at approximately 1210 hours, MST, Mr C. C. EVANS,
CAA Aircraft Communicator was contacted to ascertain if there any flights of
aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the reported sighting. A check of the records
failed to reveal any such flights. A check of the CAA maps by Mr EVANS revealed

a. Shape -- although the object mentions oblong as the bes description, it is not clear if object was regarded as sphere or disk.

b. What was estimated distance from observer?

c. Was a trail or exhaust noticed?

d. Maneuvers -- was there any deviation from flight path by the entire formation?

e. Did objects appear to maintain a uniform distance between themselves?

2. The possibility exists that the objects reported may have been a cluster of passive or regular air research balloons. It is known that during the past several years satellites have been sighted passing over this area near Denver, Colorado. It is, therefore, desired that aerial research aerosols in the range area be coordinated.

3. Pertinent of Air Force letter inclosed, dated 4 May 1949, requests that Dr. T. Townsend Brown be notified of any Project Twinkle (Preliminary) activity in the Denver, Colorado area between 1 June 55 and 15 September 1949.

4. As the requirements of Dr. Wiley in this matter are not known, it is, therefore, desired he be contacted at his present address; Piecolittle Ranch, P. O. Box 516 Idaho Springs, Colorado prior to any further investigation of this incident.

5. In view of Dr. Talleys association with the Scientific Advisory Board, it is expected that he will be granted the full cooperation of your office during the investigation of this incident.

1. In accordance with paragraph 4, first indorsement, on 21 July
1949 Dr. G. E. VALLEY was contacted at Mt. Evans, Idaho Springs, Colorado.
Dr. VALLEY stated that it was his desire to be contacted concerning
Project Grudge activity in the vicinity of Denver because he wished
to be on the lookout for such objects. Dr. VALLEY is doing his research
work on Mt. Evans, altitude 14,260 feet, and because of his vantage
point felt that if there were any objects in the vicinity, he might be
able to observe them. It is desired to be contacted immediately
either by telephone or telegram, of the sighting of any objects so he
can be on the alert for the same. Arrangements have been made with Dr.
VALLEY whereby this Office will notify him immediately should anything
of this nature occur. This will be accomplished by using the term
"Grudge" and naming the place of sighting and the time sighted. It is
suggested that District Offices 13, 16, and 17 be [advised?] of the above
