a. Intermittent bright light traveling at a speed estimated at over five thousand miles per hour, emitting no sound, except when a bright light and a thunder-type sound was heard. Approached from southwest, made slight turn and disappeared in a southeast direction. A bright light was observed about every twenty degrees of arc from the observer and no lights between these points. The light, when on, seemed to grow less intense two, three, or four times. Time the light was observed - each time two to five seconds. Outline of the dark sky no object was visible.

b. Observed at 2215 EST, 20 May 1955 from thirty seconds to a minute and a half.

c. Observed visually from the ground.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically an "UFOB INDEX CARD" from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

Based on the text in the image, the output is as follows:

UFoB INDEX CARD
1. DATE 20 MAY 1955
3. DATE-TIME GROUP Local 20:30/5/55
5. PHOTOS Yes
6. LOCATION Malvern, Pennsylvania
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION 1-2 minutes 
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS One (1)
9. COURSE Vertical
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Intermittent bright light traveling at a speed estimated to be considerable (ground speed estimated 2,000 mph). Light appeared to be emitting flashes of light, and a thunder type sound was noted. During the flight path from south to north-northwest, the object diminished in intensity and finally disappeared. The intermittent light was observed about every twenty (20) degrees from the observer and to the dark sky, no object was visible.
11. COMMENTS Due to the elapsed time of over 1 month between date of sighting and date of this report, the impossibility of further investigation is evident. No investigation authorized by this headquarters. It is possible that the intermittent light was due to the accidental crossing of the sky at a high rate of speed with its running lights flashing on and off.
