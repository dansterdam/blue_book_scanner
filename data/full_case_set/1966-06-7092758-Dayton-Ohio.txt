Observer noted object comparable in brightness to the moon. Bottom edge was convex, top side irregular but size and shape changed during observation. There were red orange flashes noted. Object just faded from view. Observer reported clouds in the area of the sighting possibly accounting for the disappearance of the moon. On 20 June the moon was approaching the first quarter which would have been as the observer reported.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or report form with various questions about the observed object, such as whether it disappeared, moved behind something, or moved in front of something. The form also asks the observer to describe details about the object, such as its sound, color, and angular size. Finally, it instructs the observer to draw a picture or sketch of the object and its movement.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object it covers. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an area beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
