UFO Sighting

31 January 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your recent letter of 25 January 1963 to Dr. Hynek has been referred to us (TD-R) for attention and reply.

The negative in question was forwarded to us by the US Photographic Interpretation Center, and it was to be returned to you, and it was, therefore, retained in our files. Now, however, we are returning the negative and are including with it's print and an enlargement.

Photo analysis indicates that the object is the most probable cause of the sighting.

We appreciate your interest in the U.F.O. program and thank you for your cooperation with the Air Force on this matter.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

On January 25, 1962, four members of the Miami Astronomical Association and I held an observing session during which we sighted a strange object in the sky for approximately 45 minutes. After securing a poor quality photograph of the object, we felt that you might be interested in examining it.

I secured a poor quality photograph of the object, and this is being submitted to the USAF Project Blue Book for their evaluation. We collected considerable additional data during the observing session, and I would be happy to provide you with a full report if you are interested.

Please advise if you wish the photograph returned. If not, it will be retained as part of our records.

I have been writing patiently for a very long, and received no acknowledgment of my photographs. Thank you for your trouble.

Yours very truly,

SUBJECT: (U) UFO SIGHTING

LOCATION: MIAMI, FLORIDA/3 FEBRUARY 1962
DATE OF REPORT: 23 FEBRUARY 1962

EXTRACT: On 23 January 1962, at approximately 2125 local time, a group of five observers sighted a UFO near the Miami International Airport. The UFO was described as round, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and emitting a bluish-white glow. It was hovering at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet and was moving in a horizontal direction. After approximately 10 minutes, the UFO accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

An immediate investigation was initiated. The object was observed to be non-luminous, and no sound was detected. Six independent witnesses at two separate locations observed the object simultaneously. The observers included an experienced private pilot, several businessman, and a police officer. All observers were considered reliable.

The position of the camera being used to photograph the object was ascertained, and it was determined that the film exposed did not show the object. All observers were interviewed, and their statements were recorded. No reasonable explanation for the sighting could be determined.

For 23 February 1962, similar UFO's were sighted by the following members of a group known as the Miami Astronomical Association: The standard intelligence evaluation and is used as the last item in the a.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2, Section C, Paragraph 13, the following data is submitted:

a. (1) The objects were observed by the five witnesses named in Para 1 as follows:

(a) Circular in shape, about the size of a small aircraft, flying in a straight line, very bright in appearance, similar to four oval objects.
(b) Using binoculars, appears to have witnessed four round objects making a very rapid and erratic maneuver, somewhat bluish in color.
(c) Observed a hazy line and noticed four "dots" that appeared to be traveling at a higher speed than the objects previously observed.
(d) He observed the objects and noticed they were blinking "on and off", and appeared to be a diffused, cluster-like objects traveling at a high rate of speed, vaguely circular in appearance.
(2) All witnesses agree that the objects were extremely small and could be compared to the size of a dime at arm's length, completely unidentifiable, and were traveling at a very high rate of speed.
(3) The objects were believed to be at least 20 miles away but appeared to be dull white in color.
(4) Overhead they appeared to be a whitish-orange in color, and as they passed overhead they then appeared to be reddish-orange in color.
(5) The objects were observed for approximately 10 to 15 seconds, and their color-blindness which would cause him to see the objects colored as he described normally.

b. No sound was heard, but at the time of the visual observation, Police or others were conducting which made any additional observation practically impossible, as the ones already described thus far.

The objects appeared from the SSE in a straight line. As they came overhead, their size compared to the diameter of one little finger held at arm's length, at an angle. They disappeared into the NW at an angle and disappeared from sight. The manner of observation used was ground-visual and one of the manners was telescopic.

(1) 0223/26 January 1962
The time of observation was night.
(2) The objects were observed from between 6th and 7th Avenue on 10th Street in South West Miami, Florida at coordinates 25-46-00N, 080-12-00W.
Considered unidentified on the basis of the lack of definitive information to explain or rule out the phenomena. 
(3) Observers account of weather conditions indicate that it was clear, no clouds, visibility was 9 to 10 miles, at ground level, which enabled a sighting for the following as relates to wind direction and velocity in degrees and knots as of 2300 hrs EST through 2400 hrs EST 25 January 1962. 

Altitude      Degrees    Knots
10,000'       170        12
15,000'       160        12 
20,000'       160        12
25,000'       180        15
30,000'       180        22
35,000'       180        24
40,000'       180        10

(3) Ceiling was excellent and clear.
(3) Visibility was 9 to 10 miles.
(3) Wind was no more than 10 knots in the area.
(3) Observers temperature determined at this time there was no unusual activity or condition at the Miami International Airport or in the area. Miami International Airport observed negative report on any unusual activity in the Observatory for this area revealed a negative report on any unusual activity in the observation for the stated time.
In conclusion, the case cannot be satisfactorily explained or identified and must be considered of an unknown nature. The time of observation in this case was found to be correct. No aircraft from Homestead AFB, the Homstead Air Force Base Photo Lab relating to a Ground or Air Triangulation Survey proved pertinent. A report of distant aircraft sightings from Bermuda at approximately the same time of the sighting and other records have not been located to date to further identify or explain the phenomena observed.

1. One photograph was obtained of what is believed by the observers to be the track of an unidentified object. It is known as an "Astrorapri" and was produced by one of the observers, Michael Holvoat. The photograph has been examined in detail with a microscope and shows a 2" diameter hole with a surrounding fog-like substance. It uses the mounting to allow for the guide telescopes weight. The photograph served as a hand-operated slow-motion drive to examine a portion of the exposed film.

2. Photo Analytic Division of IPCCOI and AFD evaluated the film.

3. Photostat copy of star chart where objects were sighted (prepared by observers).

Attachment #1

United States Air Force, Department of Intelligence, Homestead Air Force Base, Homestead, Florida

Dear Sirs:

My name is [redacted] and I reside at [redacted], Coral Gables 46, Florida. I am an amateur astronomer and a member of the United Amateur Astronomical Association of Miami, Florida.

On the night of January 25, 1962, a private star party was held at my home, [redacted], Coral Gables 46, Florida for some of the members of the Miami Astronomical Association and myself.

At approximately 9:25 P.M. E.S.T., all the members noticed four diffuse like objects which were traveling almost overhead. They appeared to be traveling in a northerly direction. They were approximately the size of a second magnitude star.

I then observed them through my binoculars to examine them more closely. There were four objects that appeared to be larger than the disk of Saturn as seen through a 4-inch refracting telescope. The objects appeared to be cigar-shaped and came to a point at both ends. They remained in a tight formation. The speed of the objects was approximately that of a jet aircraft. At times, the objects seem to wobble or oscillate in their flight pattern, but no red, green or white lights were observed. The objects remained in view for approximately two minutes and then disappeared from sight.

The entire phenomena lasted for twenty seconds. After the objects disappeared, we immediately called the local weather station and other agencies, but no one else reported seeing these strange objects.

We arrived at the conclusion that these objects were not terrestrial in nature. To eliminate the possibility of their being airplanes, weather balloons, meteors, satellites or any man made craft, we would like to know if there have been any similar observations of these objects reported in the Florida area who saw these same objects.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this letter.

Very truly yours,

1. The following is a Photographic Analysis of print 1/1-V/U marked in orange on the UFO sighting 26/2/52. Analysis is based on the 19th Bomb Wing Photo Lab, Homestead AFB, Florida. Each alphabetical letter is keyed to the correlating information on the photo.

A. Dust on raw film when exposure was made (leaves black mark on print).
B. Dust on negative: when print was made (leaves white marks on print).
C. Scratch on negative (as this doesn't show on print, the negative was probably scratched after the print was made).
D. Unknown foreign matter stuck to back of film (this is not a negative photographic image).
E. Unscored : probably star tracks on both are exactly the same length as they would be during a time exposure of the night sky. The reason for only one set of them showing is the unscored of the film caused when developed or printed.
F. UNKNOWN - The following are possible:
1. Aircraft: The changing position of the four UFO objects could be caused by aircraft in different positions in the air.
2. Rockets: Rockets as well as aircraft are being used for the same survey projects.
3. Man-made satellite: either passing over, going up from the launch site or coming down through atmospheric friction.
4. Meteorites will fall and break up the same as satellites only usually at a faster speed.
5. Still UFO.
