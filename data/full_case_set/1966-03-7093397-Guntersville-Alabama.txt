The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains an illustration showing how to indicate the position and movement of a UFO object, as well as instructions for the observer. There is no photograph present on this page.

Transcribing the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.

Guntersville, Ala.
April 6, 1966

Dear Sir:

I have an interesting sighting to report to you. On March 31, 1966 at approx. 6:00 P.M. I went outside to observe the sunset. As I viewed the sky, I saw a bright stationary object like the more significant stars. This object was observed for about 20 minutes. It did not move at all and was approximately in the West. It appeared to be elongated in shape and did not give the impression of being a star. The more significant and significant object just sat there. 

There appeared to be no sound or tail as is associated with a missile or jet. The object was silvery or metallic in appearance. This is the first time I have observed such an object.

Yours truly,
Guntersville, Ala.
