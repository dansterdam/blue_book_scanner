There appears to be no photograph present in this image. The image shows a Project 10073 Record Card with details about a UFO observation.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 10 Jul 58
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: GMT 11/2330Z to 0340002
3. LOCATION: Billings, Montana
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. SOURCE: Three civilians
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: three
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 hr 10 mins
8. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS: three objs, thinner & longer than cigars; vertical outline. In a loose group - first obj was stationary when first sighted, then two more moved toward it. Second obj moved horizontally, leaving a vapor-like trail & joined up w/ the first. Third obj then joined the two other objs, returned to a point beneath the first group. All three moved south at a moderate speed.
9. CONCLUSIONS: Probable interplay of sun's slant rays on scattered clouds.

The image contains a photograph showing a particular cloud, often mistaken for a flying saucer. The text describes this cloud as a lenticular cloud, which is a layer of air close to the Earth's surface that acts as a lens to bring a distant light source into focus. The text explains that this lens-like effect can make distant objects appear distorted, leading some people to see "weird things" like flying saucers. The text promises to discuss this phenomenon in more detail in a later chapter.

The text as transcribed from the document is as follows:

People have frequently mistaken what is something real, not a hallucination like a pink elephant. Nor is it an optical illusion. Light may depart appreciably from its nearly straight-line path when exceptional temperature conditions occur in the lower atmosphere, as, for example, when an intensely hot or extremely cold layer of air overlies a colder or warmer stratum. 

Fig. 2. A lenticular cloud, often mistaken for a flying saucer. The air acts as a sort of lens to bring a distant light source into focus. The lens is imperfect, so that the world seen through it is a little distorted, looking strange, like someone's spectacles. No wonder one sees weird things - even flying saucers. This brief description of a mirage will have to serve until we consider the question in more detail, in a later chapter.
