To: Project Blue Book

    The following report is submitted for your consideration:

    At approximtately 9:30 PM on 9/30/68, while returning home from work, I observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be travelling in a northerly direction. After watching it for several minutes it suddenly accelerated and disappeared. I can assure you that this was no aircraft. I am a private pilot and quite familiar with various types of aircraft. This light appeared to be much larger and brighter than any aircraft I have ever seen, and the speed at which it accelerated was phenomenal.

    I would appreciate it if you could investigate this incident and let me know the results. I am quite puzzled by what I saw and feel it warrants your attention.

    Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

Boone, North Carolina
7 October 1968

On 7 October 1968, this office received a telephone call from Dr. Russell T. Wall, State University, Boone, North Carolina. Dr. Wall stated that on 2 October 1968, at approximately 7:30 p.m., he and his wife observed a light or object in the sky which they could not identify.

Dr. Wall stated that he and his wife were standing outside their home when they observed a light in the sky that appeared to be moving in an erratic manner. He stated the light appeared to be "hovering" and moving up and down and from side to side. Dr. Wall stated that he was able to observe the light for a period of about 10 to 15 minutes.

Dr. Wall stated that the light was yellowish-white in color and was about the size of a basketball. He stated that the light did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion and did not make any sound. Dr. Wall stated that at one point the light appeared to increase in size and then decrease in size.

Dr. Wall stated that he and his wife were very puzzled by the object and were unable to offer any explanation as to what it might have been. He stated that they had never observed anything like this before.

Dr. Wall stated that he was reporting this incident to this office in the event that other similar incidents had been reported in the area.

This report is submitted for your information.

Charles was outside by a friend and noticed an object in the sky at around 7:45 p.m. on the date of the sighting. The object was in the eastern part of the sky and was very large and bright. It seemed to be hovering and then moved away very rapidly. Charles and his friend watched this object for several minutes. Charles believed the object was not a conventional aircraft and that it was a UFO. He said that the object was too large and too bright to be a star or another known celestial object. Charles also stated that the object moved in a manner that was inconsistent with conventional aircraft. He could not provide any further details about the object's size, shape, or color.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
SUBJECT: UFO OBSERVATIONS

On the afternoon of 11 October 1968 at 11:15 Carmen Marino accepted a collect telephone call from phone number 782-8966 (Boone-Salem??).

The person was not speaking distinctly; several times It Marino asked the person's name. The person was so indistinct that the name sounded like either a or a. The person sounded like either a male or a woman with a slightly deeper voice.

The person said they wanted to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object. The person said they wrote a letter a couple of days ago about sightings over Boone, North Carolina. The sightings have been occurring for the past three months. We see them almost every clear night. The Air Force won't investigate them because they say they don't have the manpower.

The objects are usually going east and are visible for about fifteen minutes. The person was quite concerned that the Air Force wouldn't do something about it. It Marino said we would investigate the sighting and where he was calling from so that we could investigate his sighting.

However, the person just mumbled and rattled on and did not give the stated information. The person just kept saying, "Well, I have to go now." I have to go now.

There was considerable noise in the background.

The person was calling from a pay telephone. The noise was similar to that of what you would find in a school. The person said they had to go and hung up.

"FILED FOR THE RECORD 14 OCTOBER 1968

Subj: Alleged UFO Report, 10 of 13 October 1958
The UFO Command Post notified this office at approximately 0930 hours that an unidentified object had created an explosion, mushroom cloud and crater in the vicinity of Tamaland, Florida. The notification came from an AP news release #59 of the 13th. This release called Marshall AFB, Florida, Lt Kline ext 3739 and requested that he find out any available information on this. Marshall AFB had not received any reports, however, he could not recall having had a call on this incident. Lt Kline called the Aerial Phenomena Office back at 1329. He said there was no problem with the unidentified object. The explosion had been caused by dynamite and the AP news release was inaccurate, It Kline said he had contacted the Florida Police Department and the Lakeland Ledger and they said the report was erroneous and the report had originated from a dynamite explosion.

Lt Marano had also called Orland AFB. They are a Navy Base and do not have a UFO investigating officer. Suggested that he call McCoy AFB. Lt Marano called McCoy AFB, Florida, Major Murphy. They did not have any reports."

BACKGROUND:
Several days after the sighting, I received a letter informing me about the incident. I assigned investigator Eric Thornes to conduct an interview with the witness. 

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:
Although the sighted phenomena has some of the characteristics of a searchlight, the duration, maneuvers and the associated "blue and amber lights" seem to rule this out. The bright actinic ascent of the object above the sky was Sirius but it was only a few degrees above the horizon and I cannot explain this phenomenon. A round body was visible which would not blink out upon the approach of a conventional aircraft. 
This investigatio9n was made by the "Special Sightings" team of NICAP and the report is submitted "as is". However, no stress or inferences are made unless they have been critically evaluated.

BOONE, MASS – 10/7/68
"Its presence by abscess itself off "like a turning light scene.
The aircraft kept on its course and did not deviate after the object
was sighted. It turned, however, classified object to light on ground. Examination of witness and comparison with similar reports upon the sketch of the witness and of confidence and feeling its reality, convinced me of the witness and comparison with similar reports."
My own impression of the witness, although based only on a telephone conversation, was that the story was within the credibility factor. I have included the sketch of the witness.
(Two other reports originated from this area the following week. One involved a large dark object which acceleratedly disappeared. The other sighting was another nearly morning, shiny object another light on the roadside, no effort was made to investigate on part of NICAP HASS Subcom. The NICAP service and police reported reports of sightings on 19 October 1968 per Report #68-57 is one-witness report by an undersized and elderly person. It is felt that the possibility that the USAF received other reports that the aircraft may have been officially investigated, etc. If such were the case, this report could be of value as supplementary evidence.)

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman

Dear Mr. Porter:

Please accept my apologies for the delay on this report. I am now past my general exams and ready to go on any further assignments.

It was a night when I visited with Mrs. Campbell, the Chairman, that we discussed various projects for the coming year. Among them was the wish to show the regular input from the consultant on any significant sightings. You feel it is important to show this regular input, and I agreed that this would be a good idea.

However, I am at somewhat of a loss regarding what further changes could be done on a regular basis. If you have any ideas on this, or criticisms of what I have done, please let me know.

Sincerely,

There is also text describing the witness's observations, including that the object had solid white and blue light parts, and that the position of the object shifted slightly during the observation.

Supplement to Report

The witness, Mrs. Grace McEachern, was not inclined to write lengthy statements in detail. The following information was obtained by oral conversation with the Air Force personnel:

6. The sky was clear, at least in vicinity of object.
7. The stars were visible, but the moon was not noticed. 
9. The object first looked circular and solid white. Instead of remaining the same size, it grew larger and assumed a disc-like shape. During this transition, a blue light appeared toward the lower center portion of the object and became more pronounced. The object appeared brighter than the moon and a bit smaller. The object remained in the same general location for a few minutes before moving away at a moderate rate of speed.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing only text.

OCR output:

14. The object was the brightest I have ever seen such brighter than the sun, but not as bright as the moon. Estimated size was about the size of the full moon. It could not limit.
15. She first observed the object from inside the house, looking through a window and noticed it moving quickly across the sky and then stood still. She then stepped out on the porch (the piazza) and watched it from there.
23. At about 2:30 AM she noticed an airplane off to the southeast. The light on this plane was blinking and the sound of the engines could be heard. As it passed out of sight, he saw the bright object again.
26. She had no way to estimate distance to object.
27. The elevation was about 15-20 above horizon (my estimate).
29. The object had a metallic shell, reflecting, seemed to be of West Quincy. Though she tried to keep her address as West Quincy, MA firmly in mind, the object was approximately a mile and a half away.
30. The nearest airport is about eight miles to the SSE. She knew of this and mentioned it.

Her previous dealings with the object of lighting or rotating curiosity. She had volunteered no ideas on the origin of UFO's in general or the cause of the sighting she witnessed.
Unfortunately, too, the fortune to know anything about the individual who made this statement. From the contents, it would appear likely he or she was probably on the scene or hearing of the incident in some direct way prior to the report transmission. The person(s) observing this phenomenon do not seem to indicate a reason to doubt the testimony and are familiar with UFO incidents which the report often listens to.
Concerning the possibility of a natural explanation, the moon does not appear to be a candidate. According to reasonable assumptions, the moon would be rising in the east about 1:30 AM on October 7, 1968, and the moon would be visible in the east slight light dawn and appearing like a small silver.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
OUSJ: MOTOR CONVENTION, 22 October 1963
22 October 1963

Mr Citroen's office at the Smithsonian Institute called the Aerial Phenomena Research Branch on the afternoon of 22 October 1963. They would like to know if we have received any reports from PIAR, Mt New Hampshire for the night of 21 October 1963. They replied that as of this afternoon we have not received any reports. However, if we do receive any reports from this area we will notify them.

MEREDITH H. JAMES, JR.
Houston, Texas 77032
Dear---,
The attached clipping reminded me that I was going to write you about what I saw at mid-day on November 4, 1968.
I was in the bank at Boone, North Carolina, when I saw an object through the window that I first thought was an airplane or helicopter but as I watched it it made a sudden stop and then darted away at a tremendous speed. It was gray in color and had no wings or tail. The size I would estimate to be approximately 15 feet in diameter. There was no noise and it left no trail.
Shortly after this I was out in the country on a road near Boone, North Carolina, with a friend. We saw the same or a similar object hovering over the nearby trees. It appeared to be circular in shape and also had no lights or wings or tail. It remained in approximately the same spot for about 5 minutes and then suddenly darted away at a tremendous speed - leaving no trail.
I was out on Westhimer near Fondren Road when I saw what I thought at first was a plane but as I watched it it made a sudden stop and then disappeared. It left no trail of any kind. This was about 12:45 P.M.
The object was large, larger than a plane, and was gray in color. It remained stationary for 3-5 seconds, then disappeared. It was a total of about 30 seconds of visibility, which is about the length of time it takes a plane to cross the sky at that distance. But this object covered that distance in a flash and simply vanished.
At any rate, it was so unusual that I made notes of what I had seen as soon as I could. I could not understand what I had seen, and feel certain that it was not an airplane or helicopter or any other known aerial vehicle.
Yours very truly,
"UFO" sighting - Jan. date 10/23/63 - 11:12 P.M.: C.D.D.
West 57 Houston - Seen from westbound of Westheimer and Fondren.
Appeared as a dim red light at 11:15 - arriving as a round object traveling at high speed, 10 deg. to 30 deg. angle of trajectory. Disappeared vertically.
Sighting by - Witness' identity withheld by request.

as bright and sharp as a "shooting star". Slightly larger than a star seen by the naked eye. But not as bright as a bright planet. Seemed to be a flash of light, similar to a flash of lightning, but to flash slowly, most just a streak.

It shot towards Boone, North Carolina; passed towards Katy Highway and Railroads.

The speed, height above the horizon, and trajectory seem to be very high and fast. If it had been only 30 miles away, it would have been only a few feet above the ground. It was estimated to be 500 miles away at a height of about 50 miles and traveling at incredible speed of about 600 mph at a distance of 700 miles and a height of 130 miles. It would have to have been well within the earth's shadow by that time of night.

Or falling sharp glows in the trajectory seems to rule out a meteor or falling object. It must have been a solid object reflecting the light of the sun in some way. There was no foot, or trailing plume or dust visible such as would have been expected with a meteor or falling object.

Text extracted from the document:

"next morning and drove off to Boone, North Carolina. He said he had breakfast with my son and thought he would never wake up. I told him about what I had said about the incident, but he just listened, seeming to wonder.

He then caught up with me and said that while driving home through Lenoir City, he caught a glimpse of something in the sky that didn't appear quite right. He apparently was so startled that he nearly drove off the road. He said it was just a quick flash and they were gone. But it was cloudy and raining, and there would have been no chance for good observation or identification.

Somebody, if you know anyone the collects information on "UFO" sightings, she would be interested in this type of information. And might even have some suggestions as to how I could identify what I saw - if she had adequate descriptions of speed, height, etc. I don't know what it was, but it was certainly not anything like a conventional aircraft.

I'd like to take you and "___" to dinner some night when you're free - I'll get in touch with you again.

Yours,

P.S. Thanks for "Ordeal of Change". I've become a real fan. See you soon."

FLYING SAUCER ANGEL
A former highway patrolman saw a ghostly figure by the side of the road in Boone, N.C., recently, as his car's headlights picked up a strange sight. The ghostly figure was kneeling in a field by the road, and when the car's lights flashed on it, it immediately disappeared. "It was a figure of a woman glowing with a white light," the patrolman told friends. He said he had no explanation for what he saw, but it was a "very strange and unexplained experience." He was on routine patrol when the encounter occurred.

This witness was on his way home when he saw the object. It remained in view for several minutes during which time he made his observations as detailed in his report. The object first appeared as a bright light in the western sky and seemed to be hovering. He estimated its size to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It had a definite shape, similar to a flat disc with a dome on top. The object seemed to oscillate slightly and occasionally gave off a reddish glow. After about 3 or 4 minutes, the object began to move rapidly to the southwest and disappeared from view in about 10 seconds. The witness stated that the object moved across the sky at a very high rate of speed, appeared to be under intelligent control, and he believed it was possibly a spacecraft of some kind.

1. Shows a part of sky in which the object was seen from in front of the witness.

2. Shows the size and shape of the object as described by the witness.

3. Apparent distance: Appeared to be in front of distant trees. At one time seemed to be moving towards the witness at a rapid rate then stopped and remained stationary. 

4. In this and the following photographs, the object appears to have been seen at evening light conditions - technical center as shown in photo 2 would indicate the light was better on the technical center than the sky.

5. Location of second object: The object did not disappear but seemed to have landed or hovered at a distance and remained in sight.

Although I have not devoted as much time to investigating this report as I would like, I will submit this report for whatever it may be worth.

TRANSCRIPTION:

LOCATION: Boone, North Carolina

REPORT NO: 10-7170481

OBSERVATION: On October 7, 1968, at approx. 19:00, the witness observed a flying object.

WEATHER: Clear sky, no wind.

LOCATION: Carrroll Electric, 15 miles south of Boone, North Carolina.

REPORT OF: Ranger, Carroll Electric, two cars of employees observed object.

OCCUPATION: R/23N, Air Force, Retired.

NARRATIVE:
On October 7, 1968, at approximately 19:00, I was working my home on a picture tube for a television set. Suddenly, the lights in my home fluctuated and the television picture became distorted. Upon looking outdoors, I observed a bright light in the sky about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. The object was round and silvery in color and seemed to be slowly moving in a straight line towards the west. It was completely silent and did not seem to have any appendages or projections. As I continued to watch, the object began to move faster, but still in a straight line. It then began to accelerate rapidly and within a few seconds had moved out of my sight. I immediately called the Carroll Electric where I work and reported the incident to the dispatcher on duty. He informed me that two cars of Carroll Electric employees had also observed the object. They stated the object appeared to be approximately 200-300 feet in diameter and was a brilliant silver color. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and seemed to be under intelligent control. The object was observed for several minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from sight. I was at the time at the closest point to the object, and it was in my sight for approximately 2 minutes. It was less than a half mile straight above, and it was in a seemingly stationary position for a short period before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared. This object had a definite saucer or disc-shaped appearance, and was of a very bright silver color. It did not seem to have any appendages or lights of any kind on its surface. The size was estimated as 200-300 feet in diameter, and it maintained this size throughout the observation. It was definitely not an aircraft or any object I have ever seen before, either in military service or as a civilian. I feel certain that this was an unidentified flying object under intelligent control.

Report visual sightaage from unidentified flying object
As best I could see the object or phenomenon, as I could and it was clearly from ny first detailed position.
The object which was about three hundred as wide as the public object was very unusual. I had a flow in it about half size as other small light flows, about it ten in elevated condition when I seemed to be in a clear day, if not more high I lost the view for a few seconds as I remained the object by about 20 or 30 seconds duration.
At the top of the second hill I was offered as even better view
of the thing inasmuch as there was nothing between us and it but the low-lying terrain of the mountains and there was no cloud cover which had by our condition here about 1/3 way down hill. I was of this time 1/4 mile from this object.
I measured the size, and it was amazingly the object for exactly the altitude with my motor idling and held by both hands.
During this time, and it was possibly 2 to 2 1/2 minutes about for exactly the altitude with my motor idling and held by both hands.
I would make some attempt to signal it and, if possible, establish physical contact.
I cannot say if this is what we could see, but it did then begin to move away, great, and I had a few seconds to observe it as a holding condition. (with the appearance seemed attainable.) So put it mildly, I was less than realiable.
Apparently, perhaps because there was nothing ever to do. I remained totally amazed by what I had seen, and I remain in a holding condition.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains only text, which appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Transcribed text:

At first observation, it looked like an inverted bell with a definite outline or a similar form as best. The Paproski material formed a spherical formation for my wife and is registered silver-white in color. It was about the size of a basketball but round-shaped, not football-shaped. I estimated the overall length (or diameter) at 60-70 feet, or about three-quarters of the height of the trees which were a little over 100 feet high.

The object held a steady hovering position, not quite stationary and had a very slight vertical oscillation as if it were balancing. I was amazed to observe such a large machine quietly holding in this position. The most important thing to me at the moment seemed to be the silence - no sound or motion was apparent. Quite suddenly everything seemed to go blank again. I then got out and took a look around, but the object had disappeared. It was about 6:30 when I entered my house.

The sun sets early behind the trees in this area, and this had already occurred. Daylight continued good enough for me to notice the experience to my wife and for her to observe the details I mentioned. I didn't intend to have an undisclosed view of all landscaped flights. Daylight continued long enough for us to relate the experience to my wife and for her to observe the details I mentioned.

Text extracted from the document:

It should be remembered that I am not an eyewitness of this occurrence but only obtaining the details of the happening from those who were actually there. The thing was sighted by others besides myself, but as far as I know, the ones who saw it are not available. Where were we when this happened? It was seen from the yard of my home.

It was elongated and angular on its farther side. It may pointed north with a rounded end toward me which was smooth. It looked to be of a metallic surface while possibly 30 feet in length. It did not hover but did appear to glow faintly with a strange light and looked to be a metallic color with the bottom a shade or two lighter than the rest.

It disappeared toward the southwest and was out of sight within a few seconds. I still look to be round and somewhat a hallucination. It was still consistent with my earlier observation. Of what I could see the thing appeared to be larger than appeared to be stirred by the current.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

I cannot say what this thing was, but I think it was designed to cause one of the familiar, and I worked with planes until leaving the Air Force only five months ago. It was not a balloon. It was not an astronomical body as we know it. It was not an aircraft under human control, nor a missile, for all I know. It was not a cloud, nor ball lightning. This I cannot prove, of course, but I am certain it was not a "mirage" or hallucination. 

It was a real and solid object of some kind, whichever it may have been. The flash had a bright incandescent ray, followed by a prolonged glowing. When the flash occurred, this object, or whatever it may be, had been moving rapidly, stopped completely dead. Then ran again, this object certainly had a force capable of attracting an electric system.

VISUAL OBSERVATIONS OF BRIGHT OBJECT NEAR BOONE, NORTH CAROLINA
ON OCTOBER 7, 1968

On October 7, 1968, at approximately 9:30 p.m. EDT, observers at Camp Broadstone, 7 miles south of Boone, North Carolina, sighted an unidentified bright object in the sky. The object was first observed in the northern sky at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees. It moved slowly in a southeasterly direction, decreasing in elevation as it moved, until it disappeared below the southern horizon. 

The object was described as a bright, round, luminous body, about twice the apparent size of a star, and was observed for a period of approximately 5 to 10 minutes. No sound was heard and no trails or exhaust were observed. Conditions at the time were clear with no clouds in the sky.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES OCT. 14-20, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the series of Daily Weather Maps published by the Weather Bureau. This publication presents weather information in graphic form. The surface weather maps, upper air maps, and the Daily Press Summary are included. The surface weather maps show the fronts, isobars, and centers of high and low pressure current at the time of observation. The upper air maps show the flow of air at different levels. The Daily Press Summary gives a brief narrative description of the weather over the country.

The Surface Weather Map presents the current surface weather conditions as observed at 7:30 a.m. EST. The fronts, isobars, and centers of high and low pressure are analyzed and plotted on the map. The locations of precipitation, either in the form of rain or snow, are also shown. The valid time of this map is 7:30 a.m. EST.

The Upper Air Charts show the flow of air at the 850 mb (about 5,000 feet), 700 mb (about 10,000 feet), 500 mb (about 18,000 feet), and 300 mb (about 30,000 feet) levels. The contours represent lines of equal height of the pressure surfaces and the wind barbs indicate the direction and speed of the winds. The valid time of these charts is 7:00 a.m. EST.

The Daily Press Summary gives a brief narrative description of the weather over the country during the 24-hour period ending at 7:30 a.m. EST.

These weather charts are prepared by the National Meteorological Center of the National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. The symbols and weather information shown on these charts are explained in the legends. Copies of this publication are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
