1. DATE - 25 May 61
3. DATE-TIME GROUP - Latest
5. DURATION - 5 Yrs. 
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION - 5 mins
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING - Sighted 1 round, white illuminated object which hovered, then moved slowly to the E, then moved slowly to the NE, then moved slowly to the S, then got very dim and disappeared. Object had distinct outline and shadow. 
12. CONCLUSIONS - [X] Was Balloon
     [X] Possibly Astronomical
     [ ] Was Aircraft
     [ ] Possibly Aircraft
     [ ] Was Astronnaut
     [ ] Possible Astronaut
     [ ] Other - Insufficient Data for Evaluation
11. COMMENTS: The object reported for this date was probably an observation of a high bright star or planet, and the reported movement and position changes are those expected for a celestial object under atmospheric refraction. The brightness changes described are also typical of a bright star or planet under varying atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the description and motion of the object reported is not consistent with a true unidentified flying object, and no further investigation is considered necessary.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE
FLORIDA

Mr. Claud E. Barnes 8 May 1961

This report concerns the investigation and disposition of a reported Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sighting on 8 May 1961, in the vicinity of Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida.

The facts in the case are as follows:

At about 0030 hours, 8 May 1961, an airman on duty at the Main Gate at Tyndall Air Force Base observed an unidentified light source in the sky approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in an easterly direction. The light appeared to be stationary at first but then began moving in an erratic manner. The airman reported the sighting to the Bluebird control tower at Tyndall Air Force Base. The tower advised him to keep the light under observation and to obtain a better description of it.

The airman continued to observe the light for approximately 10 minutes. During this time, the light appeared to change color from white to red and blue. It also appeared to change intensity, dimming at times and then increasing in brightness. The light finally disappeared from view behind some trees.

After the light disappeared, the airman notified the Bluebird control tower again. The tower advised him to report the incident to the Base Operations Officer, which he did.

The Base Operations Officer then notified the Commanding Officer of the 498th Air Police Squadron, who, in turn, notified the Detachment Commander of the 1375th Photo Mapping Squadron. The Detachment Commander then dispatched a photographer to the scene to attempt to obtain photographs of the UFO. However, by the time the photographer arrived, the light had disappeared and no photographs were obtained.

This concluded the investigation of this particular UFO incident. The incident was classified as "Unidentified" since there was no explanation for the light source observed by the airman on duty at the Main Gate.

Rearved leter of Aug 8, 1961

The sighting was officially reported on Aug 8, 1961 by Sgt Joseph Rene Lacoste when the aircraft was 10 miles west of Tyndall AFB, Florida.  Sgt Lacoste reports thattthe object appeared round in shape and estimated it to be about 12-15 feet in diameter.  It was silver color and moving at high speed at an estimated altitude of 2,000-3,000 feet.  The object was observed for 20-30 seconds.

Coordination and Record Copy

Ref: Project Blue Book Case No. 8684555 
Reporting Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: ATSV LISI 
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

This is in reference to your conversation with AFR on 15 September 1959 regarding Findings Flying Object Report No. 41.

(1) Size - silhouette
(2) Size - transluceric (i.e. very low-cut oval shape)
(3) Color - similar to green, but brighter.
(4) Motion - 1
(5) Terrain - n/a
(6) Determinable features: This was traveling or a steady course and, it was very bright.
(7) Tail or Trail - none observed
(8) Duration: It disappeared I have reason to believe the air glow was quite bright that evening and its not unusual for bright spots to be observed in the sky which turn out to be natural phenomena like a bright star.

a. Description of witness of incident:

(1) That first called the attention of a lieutenant to the object on the evening of 15 September 1959, observed it for about 2 minutes towards the west and reported it to the Duty Officer.

The United States Air Force has set up Project Blue Book as an official project to investigate UFO sightings, and this document appears to be a record of one such investigation.

JULY-AUGUST, 1961

Strange Flying Object Over Base, Tyndall AFB
Talk 930

Request of Captain Clay L. Yeatt, AF Phillips 53rd FIS, Tyndall AFB, Florida. Copy on 930.

At approx 2300 hours on 25 May 1961, from the control tower at Tyndall AFB, the strange flying object was observed. Five officers from the tower reported that the object was first sighted hovering over the base, then it moved at a very high rate of speed, approximately 1000-1500 knots. The object was described as being round or circular in shape, and brightly luminous, somewhat like a mercury vapor lamp. It was observed for approximately five minutes.

Text from the document:

During the early hours of May 20,1961 for over 30 minutes, a strange, round object, glowing orange-white, which manoeuvred over the drone(pilotless)target on the ballistic missile range. The UFO was tracked by two air force radar stations. When the UFO was near observation post their radar equipment failed, consequently from electronic-magnetic interference generated by the device. After attempted interference the UFO climbed every time the base tried to obtain a range on it. The UFO disappeared in a downward direction and during the period that it was under observation it did not remain stationary for more than a few seconds at a time.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 8 May 61, this office received a report from Airman First Class James M. Hilton, 3417th Technical Training Squadron, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object.

2. Airman Hilton stated that on 8 May 61, at approximately 1045 hours, he was working on the pavement of the flight line as a member of the base fire department when he observed a bright, silvery, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet. He stated the object appeared to be about 25 to 30 feet in diameter and was moving very slowly in a northeasterly direction. Airman Hilton further stated that he watched the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, after which it accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from sight.

3. This office has conducted an investigation concerning this incident and has determined that no other personnel at Tyndall Air Force Base reported observing the object in question. The Weather Bureau and the FAA have also been contacted and neither organization had any knowledge of the object.

4. This report is forwarded for your information.

Case No. 8684555
Tyndall AFB, Florida
8 May 1961

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object
1. On 8 May 1961, a report was received from Lt XXXXX, 4750th Air Defense Squadron, Tyndall AFB, Florida, concerning an unidentified flying object observed in the sky on that date.
2. Lt XXXXX stated that at approximately 1810 hours, he observed a bright, star-like object in the sky, high above the horizon, approximately northeast of Tyndall AFB. The object appeared to be stationary, and remained so for approximately 10 minutes. At the end of this time, the object suddenly increased in brightness, began moving to the northwest, and within 2-3 seconds, disappeared from view.
3. No aircraft or other known objects were in the immediate vicinity of the observed object at the time of sighting.
4. No photographs or other physical evidence were obtained of the object.
5. It is the opinion of this investigating officer that the object sighted by Lt XXXXX was most likely a meteor or other natural astronomical phenomenon, and does not represent evidence of an unidentified flying object of extraterrestrial origin.

A CASE HISTORY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC EFFECTS IN THE VICINITY OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
8 MAY 1961
AERIAL OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, 6 MAY 1961
LOCATION: APALACHICOLA BAY, FLORIDA
1. At approximately 2230 hours, 6 May 1961, the pilot and navigator of a T-33 aircraft, assigned to the 3904th Combat Crew Training Squadron at Tyndall AFB, Florida, reported observing an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the vicinity of Apalachicola Bay, Florida.
2. The pilot, 1Lt XXXXX, and the navigator, 1Lt XXXXX, were on a routine navigation mission at approximately 20,000 feet altitude when they first spotted the UFO. The object was circular in shape, extremely bright, and appeared to be surrounded by a halo of light. It was observed to be brighter than the nearby full moon. The object was estimated to be at approximately 10,000 feet in altitude and approximately 5 to 10 miles distant from the aircraft.
3. The pilots stated that as they approached the object, their aircraft's electronic equipment malfunctioned. The navigational and communication radios became inoperative, and the aircraft's magnetic compass became erratic and unusable. The pilots attempted to close in on the object, but as they approached, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight, heading in a southerly direction.
4. After the object disappeared, the aircraft's electronic equipment returned to normal operation. The pilots reported the incident to Tyndall AFB air traffic control upon their return to the base.

a. Ground in the air, moving back and forth, sideways and up and down. When I lost the scene it approximately moved off rapidly towards northwest. The object was still floating around in the air. When I returned at 0500 hours, the object was no longer in sight.

c. Sgt. Mallett's report - I received a radio call from A/3C Henson, the guard at Post #13, Drone Launch site, located approximately 1.3 miles from Post #13. Tyndall AFB. Airman Henson stated he could see an unusual light from his post. Airman Henson stated it was unusual to him because the light looked strange and it moved around several times. He further stated the light did not fit the normal course of an aircraft. I then proceeded to the boundary of the base east entrance and pursued my A/P vehicle to investigate the observed unusual light.

d. Airman Kelly's report - Intercepted a call from Post #13 about a floating object. Car #3 said he would check. At about 0400 hours I notified a Sgt Mallett about 300 from horizontal and it did not appear to be moving. On closer observation I noticed it was moving west slowly. I went to the Drone Launch site to exchange vehicles and continued to see it.

e. Angle of elevation and azimuth of object - Angle (30° - 40°) Airman Henson, altitude (66°2') Airman Henson, Angle (70° - 130°) - Sgt Mallett) and angle (60°) and azimuth (30°) - Airman Kelly. The object cited was 3.5 SV west longitude and 30° north latitude.

f. Angle of elevation and azimuth of object upon disappearance: It disappeared at a 60° single (Airman Henson) I was not there when object disappeared (Airman Elmore), disappeared when gaining altitude (Sgt Mallett) and cannot say (Airman Kelly).

g. Description of flight path and maneuvers of object - It went up and down, back and forth (Airman Henson), up and down, back and forth (Airman Elmore), moved to downward position, then would gain altitude rapidly, then moved slowly from northeast to southeast (Sgt. Mallett).

h. How did the object disappear? - It disappeared at a 90° angle, slow to southeast (Airman Henson), wasn't there when it disappeared (Airman Elmore), disappeared when gaining altitude, traveling from northeast to southeast. Gained altitude slowly and disappeared from view (Sgt Mallett), and faded out (Airman Kelly).

c. USAF Order 13-1, RAPCON was painting a sighting that the Air Police at the ground launched site had called in.
(1) I notified Brush Off Control and they too were painting an object 8-12 miles west of PAM. The object was at first reported 2 miles west of the TACN, then abruptly shifted to 8-12 miles west.
(2) I notified MOADS and they in turn scrambled a Hot Fighter to run on this object. Fighter was airborne in two minutes. Radar was still tracking this object. Fighter didn't see a thing, even though he was getting a sporadic paint on his radar.
(3) Object was at first traveling 2-4 miles an hour, then up to 45 miles an hour. From all indications it was scrambled due to the slowness of it. Prob a F-4.
(4) At approximately 0810C Radar lost contact. I called the Navy Mine Defense Laboratory to see if they had any people on their stations that they have two miles and ten miles out in the bay. Stage #1 and 2 out. No sighting. Stage #2 ten miles out. No report as yet.
(5)contacted the Florida Highway Patrol, Bay County Sheriff, Gulf County Sheriff, Panama City Police. No reports of any sighting at all. Also called Fannin Field - no aircraft or ground reports.
(6) Four Air Policemen saw it - RAPCON. Brush-Off painted it on Radar.
