There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" and a hand-drawn diagram.

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch depicts a compass-like diagram with directions labeled, which appears to be used for indicating the direction of a phenomenon when first seen. The smaller sketch on the right shows a landscape with a person standing on a road. The text at the bottom states "This sketch isn't big enough."

DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN: PLACE A X MARK ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

TO THIS SKETCH BELOW: PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND DRAW A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OR THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "FIRST SEEN" AND "LAST SEEN". THIS IS APPROXIMATELY AN EXAMPLE OF THE MOVEMENT AND POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON.
