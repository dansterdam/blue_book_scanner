The image contains a hand-drawn diagram illustrating the sighting of an unidentified phenomenon. The diagram shows an angular trajectory relative to the observer, with measurements and labels indicating the altitude and position of the observed object over time.

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE DO NOT ALTER OR CHANGE THE QUESTIONNAIRE IN ANY WAY. ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS AS COMPLETELY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN TO AIR FORCE BASE INVESTIGATOR FOR FORWARDING TO AF INTELLIGENCE. (DO NOT SEND DIRECTLY TO BLUE BOOK, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO)

The image contains two illustrations. The larger illustration shows a compass rose with a marker placed on it, indicating the direction of the observed phenomenon. The smaller illustration on the right shows a silhouetted figure standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background.

AS HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO EXAMPLES OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SKETCH.
