The image contains two sketches. The first sketch on the top shows a curved line labeled "A-1" and a shape resembling an explosion or burst of light. The instructions request that the viewer imagine this as the point where the object was first sighted and indicate how high the object was above the horizon.

The second sketch on the bottom shows two larger sketches. The one on the left depicts a road or path in a rural landscape with buildings or structures in the distance. The one on the right shows a partial circular shape.

As requested, I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and transcribe all the text found in the document:

This page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document does not contain any photographs. The document appears to be a questionnaire with instructions and questions related to observing and describing a UFO sighting.

OCR text:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
