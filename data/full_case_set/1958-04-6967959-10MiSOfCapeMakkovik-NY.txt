ATC Comment: Reference
(1) Sight of strange light tracing flight path between trawler and icebreaker on radar known as anomaly not fully explained. This phenomenon has been reported before but its cause remains unknown.
(2) Light movement thought to be some form of plasma discharge or electrical disturbance was observed although no unusual atmospheric conditions existed at the time.
(3) No clear explanation for this radar sighting can be determined from the available information.
