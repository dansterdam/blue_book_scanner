Observer has reported numerous observations of alleged UFOs over the years. The descriptions have varied as have the time (duration) of the sightings. Aircraft are believed responsible for the sightings. Observer has reported four UFO sightings since 29 March 66. However, the witness' descriptions are lacking in details and are considered to be unreliable. The information received was a very poor quality. Further information is necessary before a definite conclusion can be reached; however, the case in question does not warrant such additional investigation.

saw something 30 Mar 66 (03452) and reported it to us. After
checking with 62 DW Operations, we had no acft flying in that area
at this time: However, these eleven people heard jet acft. Also, Discussion

some facts
1. Spicers report of 30 Mar = What was it?
2. 7 Apr 66 combining two reports. Need separation.

Paragraph K. Comments of Preparing Officer have been confusing and vague. The majority of reports have been & saying - Probable cause of sighting unknown unless influenced by publicity received by UFO recently. Paragraph 16 of AFR 200-2 says: The preparing officer will make a preliminary analysis and a comment on the possible cause or identity of the object he is reporting, together with a statement supporting his comment and analysis. He will make every effort to obtain pertinent items of information and to test all possible leads, clues, and hypotheses concerning the identity or explanation of the sighting. The preparing officer receives the report, initiates a search to identify it, and passes on his conclusion.

1. Were there eleven observers to the 29 March sighting or to the 7 April sighting?
2. Mailing addresses were not provided for the eleven witnesses. These are necessary so that we may reach them to get further information on their observations.
3. Complete weather data is needed for both the 29 March and 7 April sightings.

Saucer Is Reported
At Napeague Beach
Wednesday night, March 30, was
very fine night for driving - but
Bruce Field of 82 Collins Avenue,
East Hampton, was driving his new
Chevrolet wagon home over Napeague,
his rear lights suddenly went out
as he was going up the hill. He stepped on the brakes, but the lights did
not come on. As he went down the hill,
suddenly his lights went put, out
and his motor would not turn over.
He pulled the car over to the side,
to tinker, when, equally suddenly,
the lights went back on and the motor
started without any difficulty. He
and the engine started.
Within minutes, the same electrical failure occurred again. This
time, as he was tinkering under the
hood, he noticed a light along the
ground. He said the light moved off
and the buggy was going along eastward,
more of less parallel with him.
Mr. Field said the light was very
bright and dim alternately, "and
then returned. As it moved slowly
over the road toward the station towers,
the light did not get noticeably
dimmer or brighter." Mr.
Field says he has ever
seen and he sharpe was that of a

50 and 75 feet long, and about 700
feet northwest.
As the towers, the object suddenly took off faster than a jet
is said to fly, and disappeared
beyond, to Fisher's Island. It
went out of sight in a moment, he
said. There was not a sound, nor
did he see a car until he passed
the station, on his way to Town Police headquarters to tell his story.
Three Mile Harbor Police at
10:15 p.m. Mrs. Dallas Spicer of Abraham's Path,
near Three Mile Harbor Road,
reportedly called the police about having seen, together with her wife,
a "whirling disc pole" at the road near
their house. It was pale blue, and
it made the house pole cascade as
which glowed changed from
light itself moved to and fro.
Mr. Spicer had short the police
this sighting was "very bright", and it
was "very bright. and it is not a
star."
On March 31, 1966, Mrs. Spicer called
second time, to report that the light
spot very bright and was teaving
again after it had been seen as the
East Hampton." And a few moments
later she called to say that "the object" was over the Hampton Cablevision television tower, three and
a half miles east.
After the Spicer's first call, Sergeant Russell Sanders went to the
scene, but she could not find what
he had not seen the "same."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a project blue book report, specifically the "East Hampton Star" dated March 8, 1966.

The text in the document is as follows:

"East Hampton Town's reputation as the unidentified flying object capital of the Northeast has been reaffirmed. Last Thursday evening, just about dusk, two residents of the hamlet's south-side Path area again observed strange objects in the sky.
The two observers, a veteran and unidentifiable member of the Town Police Department, watched the lights, on their second sighting did not this time coincide with a view of the object, in contrast to their earlier experience.
The latest episode began at 8:04 P.M. April 7, when Mrs. Dallas Sprice, of 1774 Abraham's Path, near Three Mile Harbor, reported seeing an unidentified flying object. Mrs. Sprice had reportedly observed similar lights near the telephone poles there before, March 30.
Patrolman Paul Greenwood and Sergeant Russell Sanders were dispatched to the area and were told by the Spicers that they had observed a light rising in the west, fairly rapidly, and that it had halted high in the sky to the northeast. Patrolman Greenwood said later that he then observed it himself, "like the brightest planet ever seen". He said it was noncommital.
The patrolmen braced themselves against the patrol car, observing the object glowing high in the sky. After a while, he said, it appeared to move in a figure-eight pattern, its apparent movement against nearby fixed stars.
Mr. and Mrs. David Webb of East Hampton Knolls, Patrolman Greenwood's neighbors, also came out with a pair of binoculars. He said they stated that they had seen the object from their home earlier.
When the lights of high-flying commercial jet planes would appear, Patrolman Greenwood said, the unidentified object would dim and become less noticeable, only to reappear when the jets had passed. Last Thursday, after the initial sighting, more unidentified flying objects had been reported the night before over Amagansett, following last week's report from the County Department of Health and investigators of the private National Phenomena, visited the scene."
