On the trailing edge of the wing were 6 to 8 pairs of round glowing white lights, located between the dark stripes on the underside of the wing. The lights appeared to be very brilliant, and there were 12 to 16 lights in all. The object was traveling at an estimated speed of 300 miles per hour. It was traveling in a straight and level course at an altitude of 8000 to 10,000 feet. No method of propulsion was visible, nor could any sound be heard. The object appeared to be very positive about his observation. It is familiar with all types of aircraft, and apparently this object was very positive about his observation.

Action: Attempts are being made to locate other persons who may have observed this object, and if any positive information is developed, the results will be forwarded to your Headquarters.

This Hq, 29/8/51 12
Two civilian witnesses, from their residence at 1212 East Copper Avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico, observed an unconventional aircraft, chevron-shaped, about one and one half to twice the size of a B-36, traveling at an estimated speed of approximately 160 to 180 mph at an estimated altitude of 9,000 to 10,000 feet. This witnesses immediately reported this to OSI at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. OSI then notified this headquarters by telephone.
This observation of an assumed unconventional aircraft might be considered significant but for the fact that the sighting can be substantiated by only two witnesses and no other evidence.

Text from the document:

On the night of 25 August 1952, at my home at 2159 hours, I observed a meteor-like object in the direction of Kirtland Air Force Base. The speed of the aircraft might have been 550 miles per hour.

The aircraft was low enough for the neon and car lights of East Central Avenue to be reflected from it. The altitude of the aircraft was estimated to be 10,000 feet.

The size of the aircraft was apparently 1 1/2 to 2 times of that of a B-36.

The type of the aircraft was that of a one with wings swept back 15° approximately. He fuselage was visible. The wings did not appear to taper as to the rear edge. On the rear side of each of the wings at least 5 and possible 6 soft, white lights were visible. These lights were approximately 10 in. diameter and between 2 to 3 feet apart. These lights were steady and not blinking. They were a little less bright than between each one in a pair. No red or green lights were visible.

The underneath surface of the wings of the aircraft appeared to have stripes running parallel to the leading edge to the rear edge of the wings between the lights. The space between the stripe and the lights appeared to be lighted.

The most outstanding feature of this observation was the fact that there was no audible sound from motors or jets. In fact, the aircraft made no noise that I could hear.

The above statement is true to the best of my ability to describe.

The text in the report is as follows:

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 26 AUGUST 1951
On the evening of 22 August 1951, at 2145, a bright light was observed by Grant C. Ballard, 3524 Santa Fe S.E., Albuquerque, New Mexico. The light was first observed about 5 miles north of Albuquerque, moving in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. The object was circular in shape, without wings, tail or trail, and gave the appearance of a solid body. The speed of the aircraft to be about one and one-half times the speed of a jet fighter. The object was at an altitude thought to be about 800 ft. - 1000 ft., and there was no sound. The object had a bluish-white color and was very bright. Pulsating or flashing lights were noticed on the trailing edge of the object. The object was in sight for about 3-4 minutes.
(See Appendix I for possible related incident.)

VISUAL:
Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind 8 mph.

BASIS OF INVESTIGATION
The possibility of this being a conventional aircraft was discussed with negative results - it was not observes any known or unidentified aircraft.
It had been ascertained that he is mentally stable.
The photos taken of the V-shaped object at Lubbock, Texas, (see Appendix I) were shown to the witness, and he stated that the object he saw was similar to the one in the photo.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had also observed this object, but only negative results were obtained.

Further evaluation of this incident depends on the outcome of attempts to establish the authenticity of the Lubbock photos.

On the 25th of August 1951 at 2150 hours from my home located near Albuquerque, New Mexico I observed the following:
This aircraft was flying in a south by east direction at a speed I thought to be about 300 miles per hour.
The aircraft made no sound and the distance was quite large, but the aircraft was close enough so that the lights from Central Ave. reflected from the lower side of the craft.
This aircraft was unusual in the following ways: there was no noise, the size I could see was about 1/6 that of a B-29, the lights were soft and glowed like a spread V with the wings sloping back at an angle of about 15 degrees.
On the rear edge of the wings soft white lights were located in pairs, these light patterns reminded me of those on aircraft that I am familiar with the appearance of.
Over the front edge of the wing tips extended to the rear side of the wing tip extending beyond the lights of each pair.
Each pair of lights were separated by about eight times the distance between the lights of one pair.
The wings appeared to retain their size from the center to the end without any taper.
No identification or markings could be seen and this aircraft had no exterior lights of any kind that could be seen. The aircraft was in my sight about 5 minutes.
This is a true description of the aircraft as I observed and remember it.

DETAILS:
1. This investigation was requested by Commanding Officer, 4901st Support Wing (Lt Col), Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, to determine the circumstances surrounding the reported observation of an unusual aerial phenomenon on 25 August 1951 at Albuquerque, New Mexico.

AT ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO:
1. On 26 August 1951, Mr. [REDACTED] was interviewed at his trailer home at Sandia Corporation, and verified that he is a Security Guard for Sandia Corporation, and works the night shift (10:00 PM to 6:00 AM). He and his wife were standing outside their trailer home, waiting for him to go to work, when they both saw an unusual type aircraft flying overhead, and his wife described what they both saw as follows:

"On the 25th of August 1951 at 2158 hours from my home located at Albuquerque, I observed the following described aircraft:
This aircraft was flying in a south by east direction at a speed I thought to be about 300 miles per hour.
The altitude was difficult to judge, but the aircraft was low enough to observe the lights and fins from the upper side clearly.
This aircraft was unusual in the following ways: there was no sound of motors or jets in fact there was no sound at all that I could hear. It could not have been a helicopter, for it made no sound and had no discernible rotors. The aircraft was 75-100 feet long and was shaped like a spread V with the wings sloping back at an angle of about 15°.
On the rear edge of the wings soft white lights were located in each side of center. These lights were very different from motor or jet exhausts as seen at night. I am familiar with the appearance of internal combustion of aircraft.
From the front edge of the wing strips extended to the rear edge of the wing with the strip ending between the lights of each wing. These strips had poor reflection.
The wings appeared to retain their size from the center to the tip without any tapering."

The original of the above statement is on file at Headquarters, 17th District Office, and is available upon request by proper authority.

26 August, 1951
Albuquerque, N. Mex.

"On the night of 25 August, 1951, at my home at 2129 hours I observed for about 30 seconds an unidentified aircraft traveling from NNW to SSE at an altitude of 250 miles per hour. The size of speed of the aircraft was difficult to judge.

"The aircraft was low enough for the moon and car lights of Cent Central Avenue to be reflected from it. The altitude of the aircraft was difficult to judge.

"The size of the aircraft was a currently 1 1/2 to 2 times of that of a B-36.

"The type of the aircraft was that of one with wings swept back 150 or more degrees. The wing was variable. The wing did not appear to be tapered as the outer ends of each of the wings were at least 6 and probably 8 feet thick. There were lights between the wings but it was difficult to count them as they were crowded in two's with a larger distance between the pairs. The lights between each pair of lights were visible. As the object moved further south the lights were not visible.

"This phenomenon has a trail to the rear of the aircraft near the wing tips which resembles the trail of a skyrocket. The trail behind the aircraft reflected the light whereas the areas between the lights did not reflect light well.

"The most outstanding feature of this observation was the fact that there was no audible sound from the aircraft while in my observation.

"The above statement is true to the best of my ability to describe this incident."

1. Reference is made to your Spot Intelligence Report of 27 August 1951, which indicates that this office or post you are forwarding has received information from the 17th District Office concerning an unidentified aircraft being sighted over Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 25 August 1951. Inasmuch as the District Office may not have a copy of this Spot Intelligence Report for your information, I am enclosing four photographs taken by me on 20 August 1951, which indicate the object he saw over Albuquerque on the night of 25 August 1951. If he does concur that this is what he saw, have him sketch in any other details that he may be able to give.

3. The Strategic Air Command has been contacted and they had no T-33 type aircraft in the area at the time. Northrop Aircraft Company has also been contacted and none of their flying wing bombers were flying.

4. It is suggested that the Flight Service Center for this area be contacted and questioned as to whether there were any unusual incidents on the night of 25 August 1951. It is believed that flight service centers occasionally make notes of unusual happenings and report unusual sightings according to regulations of CIVI15 (JANAP-146-A) and MATS.

APPENDIX II  
ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 25 AUGUST 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT
On the evening of 25 August 1951, at 2158 LST, a Sandia Base security guard and his wife observed a bright red light over the backyard of their home on the Western fly-in bomber (B-36) was over the backyard of their quarter. They judged the size of the aircraft to be about one and one half times the wing span of a B-36, with which they were familiar. The object was silhouetted for the altitude was thought to be about 300 - 1000 ft., and there was no sound that could be heard. As the object moved away, two reddish glowing spots appeared which were thought to be the exhaust of the object. As it moved away, it appeared to give off two pulsing groups of reddish lights were noticed on the trailing edge of the wing. The speed was judged to be about 500 - 600 mph and the object was visible for about 300 - 400 sph and the object was visible for about 300 - 400 mph.

II. WEATHER
Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind 5 at 2 mph.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative results. The AC and I.D. Radar Station at Kirkland did not observe any unusual or unidentified aircraft.

The analyst's recommendation was checked and it was found that he apparently is mentally stable.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had seen the object, but no positive results were obtained.

The photographs referred to in Appendix I were sent to the OAI at Kirkland AFB. These photos were shown to the source and it was stated that the photos resembled the exhaust or light pattern of the object. A sketch, drawn by the observer, is shown in this appendix.

CONCLUSIONS
The investigation will be continued until the authenticity of the photo in Appendix I can be determined.

Appendix II

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 3 AUGUST 1951

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On the evening of 3 August 1951, at 2:15 PM, a civilian base security guard on his wife observed that they described a strange aircraft over the backyard of their residence. The aircraft was described as being disk-shaped. It hovered above the vicinity for about one and one half times the time of a B-36, with which they were familiar. The object was silvery in color, approximately 100 ft. - 1000 ft. in diameter, and there was no sound that could be attributed to the aircraft. All lights were extinguished, and the object disappeared from sight as suddenly as it had appeared.

(See Appendix I for possible related incident.)

II. WEATHER

Broken clouds at 17,000 ft. Visibility five miles, wind S at 5 mph.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative results. This aircraft has not shown up on any monitoring or unidentified aircraft.

The observer's background was checked and since he has a "Q" clearance, it has been established that he is reliable.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had seen the object, but no other report relative to this sighting could be located.

The photographs referred to in Appendix I were sent to the OSI at Kirkland Air Force Base. These photos were shown to the observer and they advised that the photos submitted by the observer, as shown in the Appendix, are the same as those taken by the observer.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

None. The investigation will be continued until the authenticity of the photographs and the observer can be determined.

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 25 AUGUST 1951

On the evening of 25 August 1951, at 11:15 p.m., a civilian guard on security patrol at this base observed what he described as a saucer-shaped, high-speed aircraft similar to a silver disc in the sky. This object was at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and was moving at an estimated speed of 1,000 - 1,500 mph. The object was observed for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.

Weather: Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind S at 5 mph.

Status of Investigation:
The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative results. The AC and H Radar Station at Kirtland AFB did not observe any unusual or unidentified aircraft.

The guard's background was checked and since he has a "2" clearance, it is assumed that he is mentally stable. The photos taken of the V-shaped object at Lubbock, Texas, (see Appendix) were sent to Albuquerque. They were shown to the sources by the O.S.I. and sources stated that arrangements of lights on the object they saw was similar to the photo. They sketched in the wing as they saw it.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had seen the object but only negative results were obtained.

Further evaluation of this incident depends on the outcome of attempts to establish the authenticity of the Lubbock photos.
