There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from the U.S. Air Division, dated 21 February 1951, regarding an unidentified aerial object sighted in Japan.

The text of the document is as follows:

JAPAN
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT

JAPAN
21 February 1951

A. J. BROCK, Captain, USAF
(Intercept Control Officer) 79th FIS,Misawa AB, Japan

SUMMARY: (Give details of sighting or other report. Give approximate time, location, description, direction of movement, etc.)

1. At approximately 1715/I, 1 February 1951, an F-82 aircraft of the 339th Fighter Squadron, Misawa Air Base, Japan (39-12N - 141-20E) took off to fly a routine alert.

2. As the aircraft was climbing to an altitude of 6000', an unidentified object at an altitude of 6000' was observed. This object was moving at a speed much greater than the F-82 and was traveling in a straight line through a series of turns (3) or four (4) 360 degree turns in the space of approximately one minute. The object was silvery in color and circular in shape, approximately the size of a C-47 airplane. After the turns had been completed, the object was at an altitude of 3000' and disappeared 1302/I. After the aircraft leveled off, the pilot reported the object to the operations officer.

3. Weather at time of sighting was clear with no moon. Surface winds were 30° at 22 knots. At 6000' winds were 220° at 40 knots and at 14,000' winds were 230° at 45 knots.

4. The Meteorological Section of the 543rd AAA Gun Battalion, which is located at Johnson Air Base, 22 miles NW of Tokyo, reported 10 minutes prior to the object's appearance at 1302/I that weather conditions were normal with no unusual phenomena.

5. The pilot and radar observer stated that they had observed another aircraft which was approaching Johnson Air Base prior to sighting the object. At no time were they able to establish positive identification on the object.

8. The Tactical Control Center had good contact with the F-82 but at no time did another blip appear on the scope.

9. The time of release of the weather balloon suggests that it was a "pyrothal" type balloon which is equipped with a candle or something as an electric light that can be seen in the darkness for 30,000 feet on the ground during a three-hour period.

10. The sudden change of position of the light from nine (9) o'clock level to two (2) o'clock high may be attributed to looking at an approaching bright star. The star may have disappeared behind a cloud or have caused the observation of a light which was rapidly with one of nature.

11. The Tactical Control Center, while having good contact with the aircraft, would not be able to detect the balloon on their radar screens.

12. The position of the aircraft at the time the pilot and radar observer lost sight of the light and the position of the balloon at the time the ground observers lost sight of the light are approximately the same.

13. A check by the 6152nd Air Base Wing indicated that there were no other aircraft airborne in the area other than the one mentioned.

14. This headquarters concurs in the evaluation as placed on this report by Lt. Charles Ford, Intelligence Officer, 6152nd Air Base Wing, Lt. Colonel DeLa is the originator. The intelligence officer and continuing exercises sound and ensure judgment in the handling of this matter.
