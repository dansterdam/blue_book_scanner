27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
At approximately 2100 a strange and unusual light was observed to the north by my wife and me. It appeared to be hovering and at times descending and ascending. The light seemed to be elongated in shape and a rather bright and luminous body. It was silent. The light would increase in size and then diminish and occasionally disappear and reappear. It was observed for approximately one and a half hours. The direction it took from our observation point was to the north.

The image appears to show a page from a Project Blue Book report, which contains a questionnaire titled "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire". It includes a sketch that shows the path and position of an unidentified object relative to the observer.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THE QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING YOUR SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA (UAP). THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE WILL BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF YOUR STATEMENTS OR CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION UNLESS YOU SPECIFICALLY REQUEST IT.

The image contains two illustrations. The first is a compass rose, which shows the cardinal directions and is used to indicate the direction in which the phenomenon was observed. The second illustration shows two perspective views, one of which depicts a person standing on a road or path with mountains or hills in the background, and the other shows a similar landscape with a person standing on a road or path.

AFR 80-17(C1)

6. "DO IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A Y ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO 
WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED."

7. "IN THE SPACE BELOW, PLACE AN X AT LEAST THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A Y AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW AN ARROW TO INDICATE THE PATH OF MOVEMENT."
