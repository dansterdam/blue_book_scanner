Witness reported that the object was in the air vertically once, but reappeared almost immediately stationary, and was visible for about 1 min. 20 sec.
11. COMMENTS:
The sighting with the location of the reported object, CG 4 Jun Venus, had a low probability that the object was Venus. The description of the object does not fit the known characteristics of Venus, and it is not known to most people. The description of the object and the time of the sighting indicate that the object was Venus.

The image appears to contain two sketches or diagrams, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and an object above the horizon line, with instructions to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen. The second sketch shows two different perspectives, one with a person standing on a road with mountains in the background, and another smaller inset sketch with a curved horizon line.

Text extracted from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) later.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" or its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch on an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

REPLY TO: GAFOL-32 (Major Coleman) 
SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING

1. Attached is a copy of a letter from Dr. and Mrs. ------------ reporting the UFO sighting incident and information concerning this case. Based on their report, this questionable report lacked much to be desired in the way of supporting evidence. It is suggested that perhaps Mrs. ------------ be contacted and asked to forward the original drawings, photographs or any other contact Mrs. ------------ may have had with the UFO and/or witnesses to the area office.

2. In what direction were you looking at the time the object was sighted?

3. Was the object first sighted straight ahead, or was it a little off to the side?

4. What was the elevation of the object when first sighted? What was its relative movement - from the horizon to overhead, etc.

5. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. ------------ reporting the sighting of a UFO. A child examination indicating this limited information reported. Therefore, suggest your office send him an ATIC form for completion.

B: Attached

Dear Sir:
A short time ago sitting in my yard I saw two blue-white pulsating lights passing across the sky from east to west. These were at about 10 degrees of the horizon and traveled from south to north.
They seemed to shift in intensity, going from a bright glow to a dimmer light, and then made another sharp 90 degree turn and headed north still glowing brightly.
It then made another sharp turn of about 45 degrees turn and seemed to increase in speed until it dwindled away to a silver star.
This is as I have described an independent witness who saw this, too. As seen instead of the red glow.
I am writing this letter in accordance with the Air Technical Intelligence Center's policies for reporting of such matters.
Thank you.
Palatka Fla.
