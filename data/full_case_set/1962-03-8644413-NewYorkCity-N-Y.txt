Dear Sir,

This letter is in reference to the strange aerial phenomenon which I witnessed over New York City on the night of March 4, 1962. I was astonished at what I saw and still do not know what to make of it.

It was an unusually clear night and I happened to be looking up at the sky when I noticed a brilliant light hovering and moving in a zig-zag pattern at a great velocity. It seemed to be at a high altitude and was changing directions sharply without any loss of speed. After watching it for some time, I realized that this was no conventional aircraft. I have never seen anything like it before.

The light seemed to be self-illuminated and did not appear to have any wings or other distinguishing features of an airplane. It moved in a very erratic manner, accelerating rapidly and then abruptly changing course. I was mesmerized by the sight and tried to keep it in view as long as possible, but it eventually disappeared from sight.

I hope you will look into this matter and see what can be determined. I would like to know if others have reported similar sightings in the area. Whatever this phenomenon was, it was certainly unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky before.

Yours truly,
[Name redacted]

P.S. I saw the smoke from my cigarette reflected in the window.

It would have considerable difficulty in determining the exact location and time of the reported sightings as no precise details were given. The observer stated that the object was observed for approximately 15-20 seconds and appeared to be round or oval in shape with a steady white light. No further details were provided.

TO: Director, Technological Intelligence Center

THRU: AFCIN-4E4B
SUBJECT: Sighting (Major Hort)
USAF 
This forwarding information is submitted to assist you in applying to the attached sighting report.

On March 23 we received a letter from (redacted) stating that, on March 22, he and several other individuals observed a strange object in the sky over (redacted), lasting approximately 10-15 minutes. It was observed for five minutes, yet the speed was described as very rapid. 

On March 24 we received a letter from (redacted) who was an eye-witness to the sighting. His description was very similar to the previous report. He stated that the object appeared to make a fast climbing maneuver and then seemed to hover. After several minutes it seemed to accelerate at a high rate of speed towards the SKY where the object ended.

There is no association between the sighting and the appearance of any conventional air force or other aircraft. Even the most sophisticated fighter planes would certainly have been identified from a conventional aircraft. Based on the description, this object did not conform to the characteristics of any known aircraft.

UFO Sighting

14 August 1962

HQ USAF
SAFOI-3
WASH 25, D.C.

The following information is provided to assist you in replying to the attached letter from *** stating that on 9 March 33 we received a letter from *** stating that the object was oval in shape and had white smoke trails behind it. It was very fast.

9 March 24 we received a letter from *** who observed the object on 24 February. This information was essentially the same as the description already given. He did not state anything additional that would clarify or expand the previous report. 

This case was evaluated as an attempt at sighting with possible correlation to the daily press and the delay in receiving the complete information, it is not possible to determine the exact time, direction, speed, or altitude involved. The description of the object does not furnish sufficient data for the distance covered by the object. The description was not extensive enough to draw definite conclusions.

THERE IS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE SIGHTING AND THE APPARENT UNUSUAL LIGHTING EFFECTS NOTED BY PEOPLE ON THE EVENING OF 24 FEBRUARY. THIS LIGHTING EFFECT WAS SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED AS BEING CAUSED BY THE LAUNCH OF A NASA SATELLITE WHICH OCCURRED AT THAT TIME. THE SIGHTING AND THIS LIGHTING EFFECT APPEAR TO BE ENTIRELY SEPARATE PHENOMENA AND HAVE NO CONNECTION.

Lookabaugh of the Office of Information, Public Information Division, regarding a delay in appearing a letter from March 24th. The letter discusses the sighting of an aircraft by witnesses and the delay in receiving the complete information, which is evaluated within the speed of both conventional and jet aircraft. The letter also states that there is no association between the sighting and the appearance of the aircraft, and expresses appreciation for the interest.

August 31, 1962

Dear

I regret the delay in appearing your letter of March 24th.
The sighting your witnessed was evaluated as being an aircraft
area and the delay in receiving the complete information is caused
possibly to the evaluation of the aircraft which caused the delay.
This delay in providing the complete information is evaluated within the speed
of both conventional and jet aircraft.

There is no association between the sighting and the appearance
of the aircraft. Your interest is appreciated.

Dear ___,

I regret the delay in answering your letter of March 28th.

The sighting you witnessed was evaluated as being an aircraft with considerable antigravity elements or air traffic in the New York area. It was possible to determine which specific aircraft caused the contrail; however, the duration of the sighting is evaluated within the speed of the object. Your interest is appreciated.

DAWSON, IOWA

A routine saucer sighting from Dawson, Iowa, dated March 11th, has one unusual feature and that is a perfectly round spot in the middle of the object, black in color, which appeared to have a blinking light at its center. The object was observed for about 10 minutes. It was round, silver in color, and completely silent.

The image contains a photograph of an old document or report. The document appears to be about a "Bristol saucer" observed on March 17. The text describes details about the sighting, including the size, movement, and appearance of the object. However, there are no human faces visible in the image.

Transcribed text from the document:

"BRISTOL SAUCER

Mr. T. F. Lilley, a draughtsman, stated that on March 17, when he was the Bristol Saucer appeared in the sky at about 7:15 p.m. and was observed for about 10 minutes.

He described the object as being a bright silver, circular shaped, and apparently 40-50 feet in diameter. It was first seen hovering over Kingswood and then moved slowly across the sky in the direction of Hanham, near Bristol. The object then appeared to turn on its side and descend at a 45 degree angle, disappearing into the distance.

Mr. Lilley stated that he saw the object clearly defined against the sky. He was watching it through binoculars and could see that it was definitely not an aircraft. The object appeared to be making no noise. This sighting was confirmed by a number of other people in the area."

Other UAD Sightings 
In Antarctica
Report sent from the SANAE base 
from the South African Antarctic Expedition, and printed in the Bulletin of the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand at 22:07 hours GMT on March 13, 1962.

A very bright luminous object had been observed from that station, which is located on the Antarctic coast latitude 70 degrees 18 minutes south, longitude 2 degrees 21 minutes west, on February 12, 1962 at 01:27 hours. The object moved in a northeast direction at that station, which is located on the Antarctic coast latitude 70 degrees 18 minutes south, longitude 2 degrees 21 minutes west, on February 12, 1962 at 01:27 hours. The object moved in a northeast direction at high speed and disappeared after about 12 to 15 seconds.

It was the same number of the publication in which the report of another observation made at Grahamland for a different date was published by the staff of the Chilean Antartic Station, according to that report, the object moved southwest and according to a radiogram signed by Capt. Georg Taylor, base commander, the object showed three different parts, namely a central body showing a luminous exhaust, and two lateral wings. That object showed a luminous trail, leaving the whole sky According to Capt. Taylor's report, the object was at first just a point of light, then suddenly expanded, showing the three parts described, and then the whole object disappeared, leaving no trace.
The report concludes that this was not a meteor and there was no information on the fall of a satellite in that region.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document or bulletin from the A.F.S.O. (Air Force Special Operations) regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting in Antarctica. The document describes the observation of two "hazy" or "fuzzy" objects in the sky that were seen by observers. It mentions that no sound was heard, and discusses the characteristics of the objects as observed through a special photographic instrument called an "all-sky camera." The document also mentions that the observation was confirmed by the New Zealand Scientific and Industrial Research Department.

them much more brilliant that the two others. A kind of "hazy shape" could be seen around the three bright objects. The observers interested in
this possible connection with UFO's. A visual object was observed north of the base, hovering and rotating. It finally disappeared from sight. No sound was heard. The report also states that the observations were made by several persons and certainly belong to the level of reliable observers. It is an important fact of the Hallett Base case that a special photographic instrument called "an all-sky camera" was operated at the time of the observation. This instrument has a spherical mirror that reflects the whole sky at first with an image of a circle which shows a portion of the celestial hemisphere. According to the information received by the New Zealand Scientific and Industrial Research Department, the observer confirmed the visual observation of the UAO. One of the photos of this all-sky camera, showing the unusual objects, was obtained and studied. From the analysis of this picture, it appears that the nature of the object would not correspond to a normal astronomical phenomenon, and there was no information on the fall of a satellite in that region on that occasion.

More objects over Southampton

On March 31, the Southern Observation Group claimed to have seen some unfamiliar objects In the sky over Southampton. The objects, described as being 'saucer-shaped', flew in a southerly direction at approximately 7,000 ft. altitude. There were four of them, and they were first sighted at about 10.15 p.m. GMT. They were under observation for about 15 minutes.
The objects were described as being quite bright, with a 'silvery' appearance, and they were certainly not aircraft in the normal sense of the word. According to the observers, the objects were travelling at a very high speed, and appeared to be under intelligent control.
The area of observation was immediately east of Southampton, and the objects were travelling in the direction of Portsmouth. That night, there were also several reports of similar objects in the skies over Kent, Surrey and Sussex."

Bristol saucer
Mr. W.L. Whiteman of 48 Penn 
Avenue, Bristol, England, was witness to a strange incident on Wednesday, January 24th, 1962. While returning home from work at about 5.45 p.m., he saw a silvery, disc-shaped object hovering over the houses in Penn Avenue. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was estimated to be at a height of about 200 feet. The object appeared to be flashing and glowing with an intense light. It suddenly moved very rapidly in an easterly direction, accelerating at a terrific speed. The witness watched it for a few seconds and then it disappeared out of sight. He telephoned the police immediately to report the incident, but they said they had received no other reports about the strange object. The object made no noise and was perfectly silent. Mr. Whiteman also stated that the object appeared to be rotating as it moved. He felt that the object was completely under intelligent control.

Other UAQ Sightings in Antarctice

This report is from the SANAN base: According to information in the "Antarctic", published by the New Zealand Antarctic Society, informed this Headquarters that a very bright luminous object had been sighted north of that station which was proceeding to north at a small elevation over the horizon, remaining in sight for only 15 seconds.

In the same number of the publication listed above, there is a record of observation made by a meteorologist at Hallett base, who observed an object which is described as luminous and round, crossing from west to east at a very rapid rate. This object is reported to be controlled by USAF and New Zealand authorities on the opposite side of the SANAN base (through the South Pole), according to a telephone message from the base commander at Hallett, made at 11:10 GMT on 7 March 1962, crossing in 3 to 4 minutes. The object showed three different parts sharply separated, one of long endurance, having the shape of a sphere, and the other two of short duration.

them much more luminous than the two others. A kind of "gray shape" could be seen around the three bright objects. The observers interpreted to be a kind of "halo" surrounding them.
When the observations ended, the shape of the base if condensed into a single, rather indefinite form. No sound was heard. The report also states that the atmosphere and certainly the field indicated that the objects were intelligently controlled.
"The most important fact of the Hallett Base observation was that the passage was registered by a special photographic instrument called "all sky camera,"used for the study of auroras. This instrument has a semi-spherical lens which photographs the whole sky at frequent intervals, according to information released by the New Zealand Scientific and Industrial Research Department. The colours obtained confirmed the visual observation of the UAO. One of the photographs showed a luminous object of definite shape, while the other photographs showed a 'trail', a scientist who was at Hallett Base, the nature of the object could not be established because it was a meteor and there was no information on the fall of a satellite in that region at that occasion.
