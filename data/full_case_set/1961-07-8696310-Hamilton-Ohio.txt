The image does not contain any photographs, only text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture to show what you saw in the sky. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction along the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object the match head covered. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the movement or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you saw.
