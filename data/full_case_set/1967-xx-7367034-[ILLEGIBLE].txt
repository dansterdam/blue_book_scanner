The image contains a report document from Project Blue Book regarding a UFO sighting in Cincinnati, Ohio on September 6, 1967. The document describes the incident where Mr. [redacted] and his neighbors observed an unidentified flying object for about 20 minutes. The object was examined through binoculars and a telescope, and it was described as similar to the bottom of a space ship, with cracks on the surface. The document mentions that Mr. [redacted] feels the people in the country are not "crazy" and that the Air Force has been a "little pooh pooh about the sightings". It also states that Major Quintanilla said he would send Mr. [redacted] four copies of the FTD Form 164 so that he and his neighbors could complete them and return them in the self-addressed envelope.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subject: UFO Sighting, 6 September 1967, Cincinnati, Ohio

Mr. [redacted], Cincinnati 15, Ohio and his neighbors observed an unidentified flying object at 950 pm. Mr. [redacted] said he was intrigued at what he saw. The duration of the sighting was at least twenty minutes long. His next door neighbor observed the object while walking his dog. He and his son put binoculars and telescope on the object. The object looked like somebody reached down and put the object out. The object never changed position, it was in the west, 270 deg az and 75 deg elev. The object was perfectly stationary. The pulsating was similar to that of a lightning bug but not quite the same. Mr. [redacted] gave his boy and the neighbors boy a pencil and they all drew the same thing. It looked like the bottom of our space ships, with cracks in the surface, similar to that of a volcano. Mr. [redacted] said he didn't know if anybody was aboard but he sure would like to know what the object is. Mr. [redacted] feels that the people in this country are not crazy and that the Air Force has been a little pooh pooh about the sightings. Mr. [redacted] said that the University of Colorado is doing their own independent evaluations and investigations into UFOs. Major Quintanilla said he would send him four copies of FTD Form 164 so that he and his neighbors could complete them and return them in the self-addressed envelope.

II. BRIEF SUMMARY OF CASE
OBSERVATIONS - The caller stated that he observed a "bright light" which moved in the sky. The light was first observed at approximately 12:45 a.m. and was visible for about 5 to 10 minutes. The light was described as being quite bright and it never remained stationary, but moved in an erratic manner. The observer was unable to estimate the size, speed or altitude of the object, but stated that it seemed to be at a considerable distance. The light was not visible when the observation was completed.

and myself as we drove south on the Ohio Turnpike.
11:15 p.m. and we talked with the object for about 10 minutes.
Police who were dispatched did not arrive on the scene.

I talked to lt. Carr. about the sighting. He has not investigated it yet, however he is going to investigate. All information that he has is completely second hand. He has received through news media the following:

A little before 0400 1 a wife of Cossiat woke up and saw a bright object skimming over the tree tops. She observed it for about 15 min.

Sometimes before 0400 1 a farmer from Farmaburch namedwho saw a red tinged object that hurt his eyes when he looked at it.

At about 0.001 two police officers from Golsin ( one was the assist. chief of police) saw a circular object that was about a mile away. The object emitted blue rays that hurt their eyes. The object was first headed SE but then turned E. They followed it for about 2 mile till it turned NW. They continued to follow another 2 mile till their car had a flat tire and they were forced to stop.

At about the same time a motorist was on the road from Golsin to Strawberry and a bright object that hurt his eyes. It seemed to go too slowly to be an airplane. He followed it for a while but finally lost it.

A little later three girls at Prairie Du Chien reported seeing a UFO to the kids at the school (?) they attend.

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT
A red-yellow light, the size of a dinner plate, hovered in the sky for over an hour. At times it appeared to move slowly, then stop and hover. There was no sound. The light gave off a yellow glow and the edges were not as bright as the center. The light was observed by four people, two of whom watched it for over an hour. They described the light as "solid" and "definite" in shape. The light disappeared into the distance over the trees.

"Projectile was clearly visible for long distance in air space since there was practically no contrails and the like is characteristic sound and the object apparently give off an occasional light."

"I am unable to give any information on the configuration of this object due to the fact that the entire object seemed slightly lighted, it had no navigation lights, and the object itself or two occasions during observation H4 it changed color going from bright yellow to bright white." 

"In 1944 I observed a weather phenomenon known as "ball lightning" the ball had no resemblance to an aircraft of any type. It was not a celestial body."

"I don't know what this object was but it appeared as a very bright light which seemed to glide along slowly and was nothing like anything I had ever seen before."

Transcription of the text:

I write say that it was an eerie and somewhat frightening sight. At first it frightened my wife into tears.

I would appreciate if you could offer some credible and reasonable explanation as to what this object "might have appeared" but I am not a "prying sort", nor but I can't help wondering what it is saw.

When I have an opportunity with continue to look for this object. (full four observations were feeling the air is being disturbed which the object passed over the location.) I will continue to scan so I might see it again — this time to try to photograph the object with a camera which I have loaded and ready.

Thank you.

All of this took place within a few seconds, but I have tried to describe it as best I can how it appeared at the time. Through the windshield, which was clear, I could see the object quite clearly as it passed us. Looking back through the rear window, I could see it for some distance after it had passed us. It was flying was somewhat erratic and seemed to be taking evasive action. At one point it seemed to come to a dead stop but then quickly resumed its course. 

I am reporting this to you in case you have had other reports on this incident which may be useful. I want to cooperate in any way I can to be of service.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report, with handwritten text.

It seems the witness is describing something they observed, mentioning "the bright shape" and "a slow movement upwards". However, there is no visual representation of what they witnessed included in this particular page.

Now, acting as an OCR (optical character recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

"IT DOES A FURTHER INDICATE, IF SHOWN, THE SHAPE OF THEHPHENOMENON. INCLUDE ALSO ALL DETAILS THAT MIGHT INDICATE THE MANNER IN WHICH THEPHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

At times the phenomenon appeared to be of a bright shape, only the night and a slow movement upwards."
