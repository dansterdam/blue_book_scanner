The document contains a small, blurry, and indistinct photograph at the top right part of the page. The quality of the image is too poor to discern any clear details from it.

The text on the document is largely obscured by redactions, making it difficult to read. Some of the visible information is as follows:

The image provided is a black and white scanned document page with no photographs, only text. The document reads as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #153 -- Georgia -- 5 August 1948

The limited description which is offered here is consistent with that of a daytime/bright fireball, in spite of the observer's statement that the object was not a "shooting" or falling star. Actually, fireballs bear little resemblance to the ordinary, frequently-seen meteors. The trail of sparks at the end is sometimes associated with a fireball.
