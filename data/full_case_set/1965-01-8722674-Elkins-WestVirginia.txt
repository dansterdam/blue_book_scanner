- page 1 -

The image contains a detailed diagram with sketch-style drawings. The diagram appears to be related to a UFO sighting or investigation, as indicated by the instructions to mark the location of the object or objects. The diagram includes angled lines, a circular shape labeled "38", and a stylized sun-like symbol. There are also several sections of handwritten text accompanying the diagram.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can extract the following text from the document:

"29. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how you think the object was moving. Then place a "B" on the line to show the same object at a later time, and an "X" to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw it.

30*      33*       3QI

When you first saw it, place an "X" on this line to show how high above the horizon (skyline) the object was. This is where you first observed the object.

30. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

31. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged and just an arrow to show the direction they were traveling."

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

the saucer about the size of the quarter of moon and appeared to be suspended over the trees. I yelled and came out on the porch and the saucer moved very rapidly northward at an altitude of about 500 feet. It was hovering over the trees when I first saw it and when it moved away it picked up speed very rapidly. The saucer was a silvery color and metallic in appearance. I am a housewife in my thirties and live in a rural area of West Virginia. I have never seen anything like this before. I was quite excited at the time but have thought a lot about it since and I am still at a loss to explain what I saw. I hope this report will be of some help to your project.

Dear Dr Menzel,

We received a report from a passenger on an airline flight that an observation was made of two UFO sightings in the Elkins, West Virginia area. This information is sent to you because of your particular interest in this phenomena. Should you feel that this observation is not a Sun Dog observation we would appreciate your professional opinion.

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:
Reference is made to the unidentified flying object which you observed as a passenger in an aircraft on 22 January 1965 over the airma of Elkins, West Virginia.
Your observation has been evaluated as a solar image by Project Blue Book. While rare, this unique phenomena has been reported before and on one occasion it was photographed. This phenomena occurs only at certain angles with the sun, and the reflecting surfaces is a thin layer of ice crystals in the atmosphere. This layer is transparent and not visible from the aircraft.
I am enclosing a copy of the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force's project on unidentified flying objects. I hope this report will be of interest to you.

The UFO was noted by an unusual movement vehicle. Raising rapidly to the plane seats. The designed, round, bright light was traveling in the same direction, and what appeared to be the same ground speed. My attention was drawn to the fact that the object, if within unusual reflection from the aircraft or other source, was not usual with the solid outline. To the left the object passed over the mountains, the path was strait and unwavering. It gave the impression of being translucent, and not really solid at the time, instant by instant it appeared to the vast the ground at which time the object was still viewed, under the tail of the jet. The object who did not in view when the jet returned on the reverse course later he left flight appeared to the exact location might be considered to make a slight change in the part to the lift, at which time the object disappeared from view, under the tail of the jet. The object was in view of the witness under the tail of the jet for the entire period.

TO: Hq USAF (AFSWD)  
WASH DC 20330

This is in response to a UFO report from an observer in Elkins, West Virginia on 22 January 1965 under the above subject. The report indicated that the observer took pictures of an object which he described as a white light with a blinking red light. He stated that the object hovered for about 45 minutes.

A preliminary evaluation indicates the possibility of the object being a satellite. The reflecting light from the sun, coupled with the blinking red light, could account for the description given. Your analysis and evaluation of this sighting will be appreciated.

We found no evidence to support the existence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft at the time and location you specified. The case is therefore considered closed.
