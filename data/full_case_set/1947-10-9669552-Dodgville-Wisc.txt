10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
No description, except that a 'saucer' was to the NW, moving slowly to the south.
All at once in a sudden burst of speed it circled from right to left in a huge
circle and moved towards the south the same time. No sound, smell, or trail.
Very high rate of speed in making the circles.
