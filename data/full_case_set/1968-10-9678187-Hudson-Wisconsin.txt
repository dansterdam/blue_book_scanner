There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter from Major James H. Aikman of the United States Air Force, Office of Information, regarding a reported unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

SAF-OICC/Miss Turner/75530/Oct. 29, 1968

Dear ***,

This is a reply to your letter of October 23, 1968, in which you reported that you and a friend had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the inclosed questionnaire to the best of your ability, we will conduct an investigation to attempt to determine the nature of the object your friend saw. We are interested in obtaining all pertinent details from eyewitnesses at the scene.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base, civilian or military. This usually results in a more accurate and complete investigation.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the catalogs of objects reported as UFO's in the "Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14" which is available in many libraries.

Sincerely,
JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Air Branch
Directorate of Information Division
Office of Information

Report on Investigation of a U.F.O. Sighting
On the evening of February 7, 1958, around 9:30 p.m. a volunteer Ground Observer Corps member reported seeing a bright light moving rapidly in the sky from east to west over Hudson, Wisconsin. The observer stated that the object was traveling at a high rate of speed and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view. No other details were reported.

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the top appears to be a compass rose or direction indicator, with labeled directions like N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The text below this sketch provides instructions on how to use it to describe the direction of an object that was seen.

The two smaller sketches at the bottom appear to show silhouettes or outlines of landscapes, potentially depicting how an object was observed in the sky.

Transcribing the text in the image:

"IF, IN THE SPACE BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN. ALSO, DRAW A LINE CONNECTING THE "X" AND THE "T" TO SHOW THE APPARENT PATH OF MOTION. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SPACE BELOW."

- page 10 -

The image appears to contain a diagram that depicts the path of an unidentified phenomenon across the sky, as described in the questionnaire. The diagram shows the observer's perspective and the trajectory of the observed object.
