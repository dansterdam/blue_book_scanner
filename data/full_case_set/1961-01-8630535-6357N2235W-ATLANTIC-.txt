1961 has started off to be another good year for UFO photographic evidence as two such cases have been picked up by the eyes of cameramen.

On January 22 at Ft. Walton, Florida a metallic-looking, revolving cigar-shaped object was photographed over the Gulf of Mexico by store manager Henry Gadler.

No Case (Information Only)
30 January 1961
Greenfield, Massachusetts

On January 30, 1961 near Greenfield, Massachusetts a report was relayed to me by the Rev. Robbins Memorial Congregational Church in Greenfield. The report was concerning a home view from the church (of Greenfield) at 5:30 P.M. Her car was passed by a low flying object of huge size, which showed large, very bright white lights at the front and back and a flashing red light in its center. Miss Kemgas stepped into her car motor and watched the aerial object then turn off, pass directly overhead and move away at increased speed and vanish in the distance. It made a slight sound, like the hum of a child's spinning top, the said.

CALIFORNIA FIREBALL OF 1961 JANUARY 16
C. P. OLIVIER, N. D. SPENCER and J. P. BAGBY
At 6:37 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 16, 1961, a spectacular fireboll was seen and reported in various parts of California. The object was seen travelling from east to west, and left a trail of sparks and flaming particles behind it.
E. Peterson, at once began to collect reports on this object. Many detailed reports were secured from various observers, both professional and amateur.
Meanwhile, totally unknown to Mr. E. Peterson, Mssrs. C. P. Olivier, N. D. Spencer and J. P. Bagby were also collecting reports on this object. His papers were later made available to the writers, and they have been combined with these to make a complete report on this object. His papers give an excellent account of the path and very near the end. In view of the writers further confirming the details, the reports are included here.
There have been approximately 65 reports secured on this object, from various parts of California, Nevada, and other areas. The path of the object was from about east northeast to west southwest, at an average altitude of from 50 to 60 miles. The luminosity was first observed at an estimated altitude of about 90 miles, and the object was followed down to about 40 miles, at which point it appears to have gone out of sight.
The luminosity was described as intense, and observers compared it to a magnesium flare, with a brilliant white color and a trail of sparks. The apparent angular size was about 5 degrees wide, and it appeared to be moving at a rapid velocity, estimated by some observers to be about 10,000 mph. The duration of the visible fireball was from 6 to 8 seconds.
There was a noticeable pulsation or flickering of the light, and the trail of sparks was also pulsating. According to some observers the object appeared to break up into several portions towards the end of its visible path.
The most interesting aspect of this incident is that the body appears to have been a meteor or meteorite, since no fragments or remains have been found. Usually, the very bright fireballs are associated with the descent of meteorites to earth, but in this case, nothing has been found of the object. We have searched the areas where it was last seen, and find no reports of anything striking the ground or falling into the ocean. The path was somewhat steeper than is usual for a meteor, and the intense luminosity was not typical of the usual bright meteor. However, in the absence of any other explanation, and the lack of any substantiation that it was anything other than a meteor, that is the conclusion that must be reached.
From the various reports, the following data have been compiled:
Altitude of first observation - about 90 miles
Altitude of last observation - about 40 miles 
Duration of visible path - 6 to 8 seconds
Velocity - estimated at about 10,000 mph
Length of path - about 200 miles
Direction - from east northeast to west southwest

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. The text on the page provides details about an observed object, including its size, trajectory, and parabolic orbit. The text also discusses the difficulties in determining the object's velocity and distance due to the information available.

Data recorded time at end point
Observed time at end point
Seen over

Radians uncorrected
Path curvature parabolic
Radians corrected

Parabolic orbit: 1=11Â°, 2=17Â°, 3=17Â°, 4=17Â°
For comparison, white Sundisk's orbit was different- just two observers from his paper,
their differences due to what velocity they adopted:

d1=12.5Â°, b1=11Â°, c1=11Â°, d2=11.5Â°, b2=11Â°, c2=11Â°

It is rather surprising that our parabolic orbit, while in agreement with the above in velocity, is not in agreement with the various distance-the true being about 1 mile being indicated, while the various observers have it farther away-much farther away.

Without this one condition being satisfied it seems impossible for us to make an accurate determination of the size of this object.

This condition has been brought up before and been the cause of much discussion among the numerous observers who have reported and yet do not agree on the characteristics which they have observed.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The text describes an incident that occurred on January 17, 1961 in Norco, California, where a witness named Mrs. Paul was sitting in her yard when she noticed a bright object descending to the ground. The object appeared to be hot and caused the grass around it to appear baked by intense heat, but no object was found.

Text from the document:

No Case (Information Only)
17 January 1961
Norco, California

"White" of Norco, California, was sitting in her yard on January 17th. Mrs. Paul noticed a bright object descending to the ground. A ball of fire was screaming down towards the ground and a loud noise was heard. The next day they found the grass appeared to be baked by intense heat, but no object was found in the back yard. The ground appeared to be baked by intense heat, but no object was identifiable."
