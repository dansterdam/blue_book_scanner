The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text on the document describes an observation of a yellowish, circular object that was at roof top level and moved upward in an arc. Another observer in the control tower sighted the object and said it appeared to be a balloon with a small light attached. The document concludes that the object is similar to those of Garnetburg hot-air balloons.
