"They did not believe that the objects observed were bright stars, planets, or satellites, and thus to them they were unidentified aerial objects. They were of the opinion that whatever they observed was an actual object maneuvering above the terrain and not due to the movement of stars, planets, etc. They were most impressed at the time in observing this phenomenon and we were unable to explain satisfactorily what they had seen."

DETAILS:

I. AUTHORITY:
This investigation was initiated at the direction of the Air Force Commander, Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, on 1 April 1966, when a report of the sighting of three UFO's by three college students at LaGrange, Georgia, during the early morning hours of 1 April 1966.

II. FACTS:
This investigation concerns the reported sighting of three UFO's by three college students at LaGrange, Georgia, between approximately 0030-0116 hours, 1 April 1966.

III. RESULTS:
It is 0130 hours, 1 April 1966, when the students identified the objects as a strange object, which they described as a lighted object, rectangular in shape and hovering approximately 100 feet above the ground. They observed it for about 45 minutes. The object took off suddenly at a very high rate of speed, then stopped and hovered again. At 0130 hours, 1 April 1966, the college Dean Sergeant, First Lieutenant [redacted], and other Air Force Base officials started an investigation. At approximately 0145 hours, the three students at LaGrange College, LaGrange, Georgia, reported the incident and were interviewed. Their story was consistent and they appeared to be truthful.

At 1720 hours, 1 April 1966, the LaGrange Daily News, LaGrange, Georgia, was telephoned and the advertising department was contacted. This department reported that they had received no calls for the past two days about any unusual sightings or strange objects in the sky.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of reports and investigations into unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force.

OCR output:

On 7 April 1966, between 1725-2000 hours, 1 April 1966, attempts to contact two LaGrange College students who allegedly observed objects in the sky over LaGrange, Georgia on 1 April 1966. The students were unable to furnish any additional information and the event triggered little other investigation. There is no evidence the students had been hoaxed or misinterpreted their observations.

The La Grange Daily News reporter, [redacted], was unsuccessful in his attempts to telephonically contact the students on 1 April 1966. Editor of the La Grange Daily News, [redacted], was able to contact the students at approximately 1602 hours, 1 April 1966. The students stated they observed the objects at about 1800 hours, 1 April 1966 but were unable to furnish any additional information.

On a April 1966, [redacted], Sheriff Troup County, Georgia, and [redacted], Project Blue Book, contacted the students. The students reiterated their 1 April 1966 observation but were unable to furnish any additional information.

On a April 1966, [redacted], two students, were interviewed. The students were apparently, in interviews, appended to this report.

On 7 April 1966, physical examination in the area from which the students reportedly observed the UFOs revealed nothing unusual. The students were unable to return to the college until 9 April 1966.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. 

The text in the document is as follows:

"The Broad Street Dormitory, LaGrange College, LaGrange, Georgia, is located west of the main entrance of the college campus. The building, which was formerly a hospital, is a three-story structure with a brick exterior and a tile roof. There is a small alley which has numerous houses and high trees on both sides. A small bank of trees faces the street on the south side of the building. The building and the alley are on the north side of the Broad Street hill. Screens were on the windows. Visual scrutiny of the area where the UFO's were observed could not be obtained from within the dormitory above the line of trees with the present trees appearing to be partially effective visual screens. Three sketches are appended to this report as Attachment 3 for reference."

"14. On 4 April 1966, 2255 (7:55 p.m.) Sgt ROBERT RAY 21831, Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, LaGrange Air Force Station, LaGrange, Georgia, was interviewed and stated in substance: Several small single engine aircraft and two twin engine aircraft were observed landing on the runway at the Callaway Airport, LaGrange, Georgia. Two jet aircraft were also observed overflying the field at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. Only the landing and takeoff of the small aircraft were reportedly observed. Military aircraft are frequently in the area and on occasions remain overnight, causing additional speculation by the local residents. The weather was good and visibility was approximately 15 miles. Sgt RAY was unable to offer any possible explanation for the several UFO sightings reportedly observed in the area on the night of 6 April 1966."

"15. On 6 April 1966, 2326 (11:26 p.m.)  ...Cpl FRED ANDERSON, 31457723, Det (S), 6903 Radio Relay Squadron, USAF, Columbus, Georgia, was interviewed. He stated that he had observed three unidentified objects southwest of Columbus, Georgia, during the period from 2030 to 2115 hours (8:30 p.m. to 9:15 p.m.), 6 April 1966. The objects appeared to be larger than stars, red in color, and were hovering or stationary. They could have been aircraft but were much larger than any aircraft which could have been in the area, according to Cpl ANDERSON. He stated he observed them through 7 x 50 binoculars and that the sighting lasted for approximately 45 minutes."
