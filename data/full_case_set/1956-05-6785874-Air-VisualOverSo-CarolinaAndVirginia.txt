Statement of 1/Lt Robert D. Anderson

I was flying from Segin AFB, direct to Rolling AFB and at 20,000 ft and 250 knots, I sighted out by 11 degree (wig wig) and object in the daylight sky about 50 yards off my left wing. The object (approximately 10 feet in diameter) appeared silvery in color with dark band around the middle. It had no apparent movement and we saw it until we lost it behind our left wing.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a document from Project Blue Book, specifically a "SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112" report. The text in the document describes a sighting of a "cross-country flight from Eglin AFB to Rolling AFB" on May 10, 1957. The report provides details about the sighting, including the speed, altitude, and behavior of the observed object.

Here is the full text transcribed from the document:

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112 
REPORT NO.: ID-JSOE-l, PART THREE 
  
AFB: I sighted a cross-country flight from Eglin AFB to Rolling AFB, about 22:00 EST, 10 May 57. This was the third sight of the object. We had two previous sightings at Eglin AFB 500 feet AGL (above ground level) and the other 10,000 feet AGL. This was the first sighting of the object. I made sure it was not a star first by watching it for a few minutes the greet of the flight it was moving at a tremendous speed, and I estimate it was traveling about 1500 to 2000 mph. It was approximately 5000 feet MSL (mean sea level) and seemed to be elliptical in shape. This was seen for a few minutes, but in a few minutes the object seemed to accelerate to an even higher rate of speed and soon disappeared from sight. The object apparently had the sun's rays reflecting off its surface, although the sun's rays could not have fully covered the surface. The object appeared to be translucent and there seemed to be a dark spot on its surface as small as it was would appear round and (2) a transparent object in the pallion, which would appear only slightly lighted.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was caused by the planet Venus, which was visible during daylight hours in the approximate area as described.

1. The object was described by all observers as being like a bright star. One observer stated that the object was stationary and caused by a celestial body.

2. Although the observers' aircraft traveled many miles during the sighting, the closing time between the object and the aircraft was great distance from the observers.

3. Mention of the timing of the sighting coupled with the distance traveled by the observers' aircraft would preclude the possibility of a balloon.

Lt. Colonel, USAF
Flight Leader of the Thunderbird, and an observer of the object in question, stated that the object was experienced this sighting and was illuminated by a diffuse light, but too far away to determine its size or shape.

The document text reads as follows:

REPORTED VIEWING 77 BRILLIANT LIGHTS IN TIGHT FORMATION OVER SOUTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA

THIS REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA WAS REPORTED AT 12:40 AM EST ON APRIL 26 1956. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY TWO OBSERVERS FROM STATIONARY AT LOW ALTITUDE FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES. THE (2) OBSERVERS INDICATED UNDER HYPNOSIS A. SLIGHT ACTUAL MIND EXPANSION DURING THE INCIDENT. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS (I) CLEAR CUT STRUCTURE. THE OBJECTS MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS UNUSUAL. THE SIZE WAS ESTIMATED AT 50 FEET IN DIAMETER WITH A SPEED OF 600 MPH. THEY DISPLAYED CHARACTERISTICS OF FLIGHT AND INTELLIGENCE. THERE WAS CORROBORATIVE TESTIMONY OF THIS INCIDENT FROM STATION PERSONNEL AT LOW LEVEL ALTITUDE. TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CONSIDERS THIS CASE VERY SIGNIFICANT. WHICH INDICATES THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ASTRONOMICAL EVENT. SOURCES STATE THAT HE GAVE A VERY SIMILAR ACCOUNT IN 1948 AT LOW LEVEL ALTITUDE. AND IT HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY A COL MARTIN COMMANDER OFFICER AT THAT STATION. ALL STATE THAT CONTACT WAS A BRILLIANT STAR.

The document includes a section labeled "SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT", which provides details about the object observed. However, the image does not contain any photographs or visual representations of the object.

II. Reliability: SOURCE was a young man with a nonchalant manner. He seemed to be a highly reliable type person. This may be attributed to the fact he had already filed one report. However, he seemed to be lightly concerned about reacting to this particular sighting.

III. SOURCE'S Description of Object:
1. OBJECT was described as round, white or silver in color. It appeared to be glowing and leaving a phosphorescent trail. OBJECT was from 200-300 feet in diameter.
2. It was a bright day and the sight was very brilliant and dazzling. The object appeared to the pilot right. SOURCE was flying over open country in a southwest direction. The OBJECT was flying over the hills and appeared to just climb and then leave the area.
3. SOURCE could hear no sound from the OBJECT and the color was bright and brilliant. OBJECT seemed to linger for an instant but was in rapid motion.
4. SOURCE could not estimate the real size of the OBJECT but compared it with a star as a common object. Estimated the size to be that of a pea held at arm's length.

STATEMENT

From data on flight of five (5) F-86D jet fighters on night of 3 May 1956, it was determined that 3 of the planes reported visual contact with unidentified objects in the air near Boiling AFB Washington, D.C. Further details of the incident as reported this date by Captain Billie J. Elias, USAF, who was the flight leader, are as follows:

The flight was alerted at approximately 0350 hours on 3 May 1956 to investigate the presence of unidentified objects in the air over South Carolina and Virginia. The planes were vectored to the area by Ground Control Intercept, and the pilots reported sighting unidentified objects. The majority of the objects appeared to be spherical in shape and were brightly lighted. The pilot reported the objects were capable of extremely high rates of speed and abrupt maneuvers. The pilot, Captain Billie J. Elias, informed Major George Taylor at Boiling AFB that he was signaling to Base Operations Officer, Major George Taylor at Boiling AFB, terminating his pursuit at that time.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a young man of average intelligence seeking answers to this sight. The INVESTIGATOR considered the information of the SOURCE to be reliable.

III. SOURCE'S Description of the Object: 
1. SOURCE was piloting an F-84F at an altitude of 30,000 feet. Clear sky, bright sunlight, weather: dry, temperature: 50 degrees. OBJECT was sighted for approximately 30-45 minutes.
2. SOURCE was flying over open country and observed the object for the first time when he looked in at a bright spot below. The object seemed to be moving erratically. SOURCE continued to watch the object with his aircraft. No apparent motion observed. Object appeared to be stationary or very slowly rotating.
3. This was the first time SOURCE had ever seen an object like this. No estimated speed or distance from SOURCE to object could be made. Object was too far away to be estimated.
4. SOURCE says flight-of-object was sight of object as it glided cover in presentation for approximately 1 min.
5. SOURCE states that the object could be a star, visible due to the existing light conditions.
