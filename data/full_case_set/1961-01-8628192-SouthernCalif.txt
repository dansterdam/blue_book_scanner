The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO incident that occurred in California on January 16, 1961. The document provides details about a "giant meteor" that was witnessed by thousands of people across California, including its appearance, trajectory, and reported characteristics. The text does not identify or name any individuals.

FIREBALL CAUSES NEAR-PANIC IN CALIFORNIA: In a widely-publicized incident last January 16, 1961 another spectacular fireball seen by thousands of persons caused excitement and near-panic in a 700 mile inland area. The object was in view about 20 seconds and trailed a long brilliantly-colored tail that was visible for several minutes. Witnessed by police and newspaper switchboards throughout the area, the sighting brought numerous calls for information. Included in findings were pieces of metal debris in various places. Residents of the nearby towns described it as resembling a fast-moving flaming meteor. It was so brilliant that it lighted up the countryside.
On January 16, 1961 another so-called giant meteor frightened thousands in California. The giant ball of fire trailed long multicolored tail and left an eerie bluish light after glowing in the same area. It alarmed thousands of residents, already edgy because of recent unexplained phenomena. It was seen for 600 miles in California and at Las Vegas, Nevada, which is 300 miles inland. Many reported that the object didn't look like a meteor and that it appeared to be climbing in the sky, instead of burning itself out.
