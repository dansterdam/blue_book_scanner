UNCLASSIFIED
FLYING SAUCER
23 July 1947

MEMORANDUM FOR THE OFFICER IN CHARGE:

On 22 July 1947 this agent acting on instruction from the CIC proceeded to the Sheriff's Office of Jackson County, Ohio, located at Jackson, Ohio, and there received from the Sheriff, Stanley Louis, an instrument reported to be a flying saucer.

The Sheriff stated that the instrument was brought to his office at 1200, 21 July 1947, by [REDACTED], who resides on [REDACTED] about 2 miles north-west of Jackson, Ohio.

A man named [REDACTED], when interviewed by this agent, stated he had received it from a Mr. [REDACTED] Wright who had found it on the morning of 21 July 1947, in a tree located on property belonging to [REDACTED], a resident of Columbus, Ohio. This property lies close to Mr. [REDACTED] home.

The man named [REDACTED] could not be located. According to Mr. [REDACTED], [REDACTED] owns a hut, someplace back in the adjacent woods. He comes and goes in the community, works when he feels like, and may or may not be seen again for weeks.

The purported flying saucer is an instrument weighing four or five pounds which measures 5" x 9" x [1-/2"]". The bottom part of the instrument consists of a cardboard box measuring 5" x 6-1/2" x 3". One end of the box bears the following printed material: '75591 Ord Corps, U.S. Army. Ladisponds [unreadable] Req F419-A2-2, serial No. 1015, Project No. 2-20944, Phila-45-09, Automatic Manufacturing Corp. Remove moisture absorbant bag before flight." Above the bottom section and attached to it by metal fasteners is a red hill covered cardboard device which is 11" shaped. The bottom of the "H" measures 5" x 1-3/4" x 6-1/2". One end extends past the bottom section to [1-/4"]". The bottom of the section extending past the bottom of the cardboard box to which it is attached is open, apparently to permit egress of air passing through the "H", The vertical portion of the "H" measures 2-1/2" x 5" at the bottom and widens in the shape of a wedge to a measurement of [1-/2] x 5" at the top. The top is open, apparently to admit ingress of air through the "H". Stamped on the "H" is the following printed matter: "Signal Corps, U.S. Army, Ventilation duct. ML-359[Al/AM, Precise Instrument Division, Bendix Aviation Corporation". Nestling within the "H" is a clear plastic box measuring 5" x [1-/2] x 3 1/4". Within the box can be seen instruments part of which are said to be mechanically operated as evidenced by the presence of wiring, dials suggesting of a dial indicator which extends from the front center of the box to the cardboard box at the bottom of the instrument. Upon the plastic box is a printed label which reads, "Signal Corps, U.S. Army. [Ladisponds] Model Tpt, RLM-83A, Serial No. 205329, Date: 2-26-45, Phila-45-09, Precise Instruments Division, Hendix Aviation Corporation. Attached to, and extending vertically around the entire instrument, are two 1/2" wide web belts. These are tied to-

cord similar to fragments attached to the bottom of what was apparently a rubber balloon and the bottom of a small parachute both of which were found at the same location as the instrument described above. Not enough remains of the balloon to enable this agent to estimate its size when inflated. The parachute which is made of crepe paper, bears a stomp reading: "Japanese 16-32 J. M. Apmn". It is composed of eight triangular sections measuring 15" x 32". Eight 20" red lines from the chute are attached to a wooden ring which measures about 17 1/2" in diameter. Eight lines extend from this ring a distance of 15 inches where they are laced together. A small piece of wire 12-1/2" in length with a 3/8" circular boss at one end was also found with the items described above. This wire resembles a small aerial.
