There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official government program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) in the United States during the 1950s. The document appears to contain textual information related to a UFO sighting report.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

OBJECT: Three (3) lights seen in sky, approximately 5/10ths of a mile distant from witnesses. First seen at approximately 1:30 A.M. MST, 8 September 1954.

LOCATION: Las Cruces, New Mexico and Oklahoma City, Enid, Oklahoma.

WITNESSES: Various civilian and military personnel.

DESCRIPTION: Three (3) lights, approximately 20-25 feet in length, appeared to travel in formation and at a constant speed of 300-350 MPH. They were sighted by numerous witnesses over a period of thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.

CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient data to identify the objects. Further investigation indicated possible existence of three jet aircraft returning from south-western flight. However, no confirmation of identity could be established.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The report discusses an incident where three unidentified lights were observed in the sky. The lights were described as triangular in shape and seemingly maneuverable. The report states that the objects "have not been positively identified" and that "the origin and nature of these phenomena are unknown".

END OF REPORT

- page 8 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, describing the sighting of a green fireball over White Sands National Monument in New Mexico on September 18, 1954. The text describes the event in detail, including the sighting by a group of astronomers and their wives, the movement of the fireball, and the reactions of various witnesses. The report also mentions related sightings in New Mexico and Colorado, as well as reactions from the scientific community.

The Green Fireballs
On the evening of September 18, 1954, a group of astronomers and their wives from the observatory at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico, were having a picnic at the White Sands National Monument, near Alamogordo. In this great desert of pure white gypsum the air is extremely hot during the daytime but cools to a pleasant warmth after sunset. Supper finished, the picnickers had taken off their jackets and settled to watch the soft warm sand by 5:30 it was dark and some of the astronomers had already left but others (including Dr. Lincoln La Paz) had lingered to watch the stars, which stand out sharply in the clear skies over the desert.
Suddenly, far to the north, appeared an enormous green fireball. Of blinding brilliance, it was moving slowly and majestically from east to west in a substantially horizontal path about seven degrees above the horizon, leaving behind a luminous trail that persisted for at least fifteen minutes. At about the same time thousands of other persons in New Mexico and Colorado, as well as the crews of several planes in flight, were observing the same display.
It passed over a crosse din New Mexico and Colorado, as well as the crews of several planes in flight, were observing the same display. 
It passed over a crosse din New Mexico and into Colorado, where it interfered with radio and TV transmissions as it appeared over Albuquerque, and over Denver turned night into day. A United Airlines pilot at about 5:500 feet near Laramie, Wyoming, saw the fireball crossing his course and for some ten minutes observed the luminous cloud it left behind [L]. At almost the same instant, the fireball was sighted in the Bay of San Francisco, 1,000 miles away. Major Keyho. the Director of NICAP (see Chapter VII), enthusiastically and inaccurately recorded the meteor as two separate objects. "Over San Francisco," he wrote, "it caused a new type of cloud, so bright it cut an actual hole through the overcast sky."
When telephone calls swamped the newspaper offices, reporters interviewed Dr. Lincoln La Paz of the Institute of Meteorltics at the University of New Mexico. Although he had not observed this particular specimen, he had seen similar green fireballs a few years earlier and he commented that this was no ordinary meteor, but something unusual-a "new wave" of UFO excitement began to sweep the country. Were mysterious machines from outer space again patrolling New Mexico? 
The astronomers who had admired the fireball at White Sands were amazed at the mobile geoede. As professionals who had spent their lives in observing and analyzing astronomical phenomena, they agreed that the objects had been unusual in its slow movement, its color, and its luminance. But an unusual meteor is still only a meteor, not a space-ship, and they calmly recognized it as a green fireball of the type that had appeared over the Southwest a few years earlier.

In the years following, green fireballs occasionally appeared. An astronomer observed one over Lafayette, Colorado, at 7:45 P.M. on June 4, 1950. One soared over the New England states and eastern Canada on November 2, 1950, and a year later, on November 2, 1951, a plane crew over Texas sighted another which was dramatically publicized in Life Magazine, and described in a saucer publication as "a strange missile" that shot out red balls. Few others made the headlines until the one of September 18, 1954, but even that caused only brief excitement and the Air Force expressed no alarm.
