MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:

At approximately 10LO,10 October 1960, a telephone call was made to the home of ______ of Grand Junction, Colorado regarding the sighting made by him and others, on 28 Sep 1960, and the following additional information was acquired.

The object was first seen and reported from Farmington, New Mexico on a bearing of 35 degrees. It was also reported to be seen from Eagle, Colorado on a bearing of approximately 225 degrees. Mr. ______ saw the object on a bearing of 100 degrees. A triangulation was made and said the object was estimated to be over Gunnison, Colorado. He also stated that a B-52 was refueling in the Deadwood refueling area, and when the craft was contacted regarding the object a reply was made to the effect that the object could be see. After the refueling operation was completed the craft changed course and flew in the direction of the object. Mr. ______ stated that the pilot later reported to the Denver control that when they were in the area of the alleged object, nothing could be seen.

The object was described as round, flashing red, green white light with a small square in the middle. The altitude of the object was estimated to be 37% miles using an inclinometer. The object was reported to be stationary for 70 minutes, then it moved southwest for 15 degrees. The object was visible for 40 minutes.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed report document. The document describes a UFO sighting that occurred on September 27, 1960 in Grand Junction, Colorado. It provides details about the sighting, including the description of the object, the duration of the sighting, and the weather data collected at the time. The document also discusses the triangulation of the object's position and the implications of the sighting.

AFCIN-H-52*
16 NOV 60
UFO Sighting, Grand Junction, Colorado (27 Sep 1960)

1. On 27 September 1960 at 05212 (2221 hours on 27 September 1960) unidentified flying objects were sighted from FAA stations at Grand Junction and Eagle, Colorado and also from the station at Farmington, New Mexico. In addition, many people in the general area reported seeing unidentified flying objects.

2. The object viewed from Grand Junction was described as a round, spinning and white light and reported as generally stationary. The object was in sight for 40 minutes.

3. The Grand Junction Farmington used theodolites to attempt to measure the angle of elevation of the object and then by triangulation calculated an altitude of 37,000 feet for the object. 

4. AFCC obtained weather data for the date of the sighting from Air Weather Service. The adiabatic charts for the area show an inversion at 0.65 on the date of the sighting. The AFCC conclusion is that effects produced by this inversion were responsible for the UFO sightings in this area.

5. The conclusion which measured the angle of elevation of the object were consistent with 35,000 feet, however, triangulation revealed that the object, if it even were higher, would have been further from one station than the other, thus a geometric inconsistency. If the object had been lower, then the apparent angles would have been the same from both stations, which the apparent angles were not. 

6. The inversions of temperatures near the ground and increasing rather rapidly as altitude increases) light rays which pass through this layer are bent toward the earth and effect mirages which result from these conditions are sometimes referred to as "looming" mirages which cause a distant object to "loom" above the horizon.

7. From the limited information available, it is impossible for AFIC to determine what specific object was viewed by each witness.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, with text written on it.

however, it is concluded that the inversion was responsible for common objects being misidentified and mistakes made as to their actual location.
