Significant Unusual Condition:
The observers sighted the Diamond Shoal Light Ship approximately 30 miles east of Hatteras, NC. The light ship's lights were positively accounted for as Coast Guard District #5, 431 Crawford Street, Portsmouth, Virginia, confirmed the existence of the Diamond Light Ship at 35-09-3 east, 75-09-3 west. The Light Ship was displaying 16,000 candle power red and green flashing lights. This light is full bright for 1.5 seconds and dimmed for 1.2 seconds. It can normally be readily seen for 11 miles from the surface, and with the naked eye.

Interception or Identification Action Taken: None.

This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Dockum, USAS 4500 from Langley AFB, Virginia. The description of the object sighted was given by Lt. B.S. P. O'Neal in the presence of Lt. J. Currington and Lt. R. V. Ferrell. Lt. O'Neal estimated the distance of the object to be greater than 20 miles and less than 30 miles. He stated the object seemed to conform but the object sighted green flashing lights. Such red and green lights are used as running lights on ships, but are normally off as the ship is anchored. It is possible that they were on the minight of 7 November 1955, and would be visible if the ship was headed toward the observers.

No physical evidence was reported to exist.

This sighting was reported to CWO K. B. McPelsa at the Norfolk Rescue Coordination Center, who relayed it to AFSEC (FTD). Wright-Patterson AFB and to the 4500 AS Wing Command Post, Langley AFB, Va.
