The text from the document reads as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #59 - beyond Necker Island -- 12 September 1947

From the evidence at hand, it appears quite likely that
the object observed was a fireball. Fireballs have been known to
change course abruptly when splitting. The reported change to red-
dish hue from the previous color of incandescent light, the length
of time in sight, and the manner of disappearance all lend support
to this hypothesis. At sunset one can expect relatively slow-
moving, nearly horizontal fireballs.

Memo for: DTI-14ND,

Subj: Unidentified Object in Flight Observed by Pan American Pilots.

1. At approximately 1000 on 13 September 1947, reporting agent received
a telephone call from Lt.Comdr. –––––––––––––––, IS1, Air-Sea Rescue,
Operations Officer at the Midway Commander Hawaiian Sea frontier reporting
that a Pan American plane in flight from Midway Island to Oahu on the
previous evening had sighted an unusual object in Flight about 0500 GCT.
Arrangements were made by reporting agent to meet Lt. Comdr. –––––––––––, and
the Pan American pilots at the District Intellegence Office at 1130 this
date.

2. With Captain R.R. Lyons, USN, District Intelligence Officer, 14th
Naval District, present, Lb, Comdr. YOUNG and Pan American Officers were
interviewed by the reporting agents. They were, respectively, –––––––––––––––
–––––––– Plane Captain, who has been flying for Pan American for ten
years, has 7000 hours in the air, and has flown overseas over both the
north and south Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean between the Philippines
and the mainland, west to the Aleutian, second officer, who has 11 years
flying in the Pacific area, and in the past was in the Pan American ocean
navigation, 1700 hours in the air, has been with Pan American 2 years
flying on B-24's in combat flights for South Pacific, as well as an Air Transport
Coast training duty. Both aviators impressed reporting agents as completely
reliable, intelligent, and on observer were attempting to give a
factual explanation of an unusual phenomenon.

3. The information as supplied by Plan Captain, and concurred in by
second, is as follows: The Pan American plane was eastbound from
Midway on magnetic course 90, when at approximately 1130 time, flying
at 10000 feet and midday 2500 knots. The plane was flying on the automatic
pilot with the top-in-the right-hand seat in the control cabin and
observing the left-hand seat. It was dark and a normal 6000 - 9000 feet
there were cumulus clouds above, it was clear out both spread ahead the
time was about 45 minutes approximately.

4. The Pan American plane had passed Jupter Island at 0535 GCT. At
0333 GCT it was this was observed about 60° degrees off the starboard bow
of the plane. The light, about five to six times as many stars in the 10th mag.

The object appeared to be at a distance of some 25 degrees, and the
actual first observed was resembled to a bomb being blown away. The

UNCLASSIFIED

Subj: Unidentified Object in Flight Observed by Pan American Pilots.

1. Object grew in size and intensity, but without any changing in color, to a point that was estimated to be one mile off the starboard bow of the plane.

5. The pilots were about to switch from the automatic pilot to manual control when the object verged suddenly to an approximate course of 150 degrees and swung the bright white "searchlight" to an SZS with the two star board and assumed a reddish hue. These two reddish lights did not have the intensity of the white light and appeared to be about a wing-length apart. As the object changed course, the extraordinary speed was propagated. The object far outraced the Pan American plane and the trail lights appeared to burn out an estimated 30 miles ahead of the Pan American plane. The entire phenomenon, both straight, was observed for not over six seconds, camping roughly estimated that the object was traveling at 1000 knots.

6. Both observers expressed familiarity with meteors and visual astronomical phenomena and agreed it could have been a meteor except for the manner in which it held altitude. At no time did the object appear to get above 10,000 feet or below 2,500 feet. When it disappeared, the object still appeared to be above 3,500 feet altitude. At no time did the object give off sufficient illumination to reflect on the cloud formation at 9,000 feet. Both observers were questioned at length on the possibility of an optical illusion and the possibility of the object dropping at an oblique angle, but both firmly declared that the object apparently changed course and that it appeared to hold altitude throughout the entire time it was observed.

7. This information was passed by telephone to Fleet Intelligence Officer, Pacific Fleet, and to A-2 of the 7th Air Force at Hickam Field. No evaluation of the unidentified object was possible by any of these agencies.

Unfortunately, the poor quality of the image and the faded text make it impossible to accurately and completely transcribe the entire document. The sections that are legible refer to a reporting structure and a subject related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation by a Pan American flight crew, but specific details are not clear from the text.

Here is the text extracted from the image:

Plane had just passed Necker Island at 0535 GMT. At 0554 GMT an intense white light was observed off the starboard bow at azimuth 45 degrees. The light was CCW of CoC circular course by 1 place. It appeared a brighter red color with that of an incandescent light without appreciable blue and no green tinge. It appeared on a course about 350-400 5 miles away. Azimuth reading grew in intensity (but without any change in color) to a point estimated to be one mile off starboard bow of the plane. When the P1A sight switched over to manual control the object suddenly veered to an approximate course of nose v. of the plane. The P1 section and the entire wind R the same relative time. These two reddish lights did not have the intensity of the sunrise reddish and appeared about 6 wing-length apart. As it changed its course the extraordinary speed was noted. It far outreached the Penn-american and the twin lights appeared to burn out 30 miles ahead. The entire phenomenon was below for some minutes. Object was estimated to be traveling 1,000 knots per hour.

NOTE: Both observers did it could have been distortion to reflect on the under
in which it held its altitude. At no time did it appear to get above or below 9,500 ft. Wave [it disappeared it still seem to about 9,500 ft. at no time did it give off sufficient illumination to reflect on the cloud formation a 6,000 ft.

Both observers were questioned as to possibility of optical illusion and the probability that the object dropped at an oblique angle but both frankly declared that the object generally could sure that object generally declared to be out of approximately the same course. It appeared to hold its obtained throughout the entire time observed.

It was flying on automatic pilot with ------- in the right-hand seat and the control cabin and --------- in the left-hand seat. It was dark in there were cumulus clouds of about 4+ density. The sun had set 45 minutes previously.
