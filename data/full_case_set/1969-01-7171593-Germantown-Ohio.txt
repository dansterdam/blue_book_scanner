[X] STANDARD [ ] DAYLIGHT SAVINGS [ ] PACIFIC [ ] OTHER
5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENA? IF IN CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON DIAGRAM TOWN OR CITY, ETC. LIVING ROOM OF HOME
GERMANTOWN, OHIO
6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN "X" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENA WAS ABOVE THE HORIZON, OR ESTIMATE THE DEGREES. SKETCH BASED UPON YOUR DESCRIPTION IS PLACED A 5 OR THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW THE HEIGHT OF THE PHENOMENA.
(The sketch shows an elevation diagram with a point on the curve labeled "5".)

The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch is a compass rose, and the second contains two sketches that appear to show the movement or path of a phenomenon or object in the sky.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "O" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED OR WAS MOVING.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "O" AT THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "O". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS STEP.
