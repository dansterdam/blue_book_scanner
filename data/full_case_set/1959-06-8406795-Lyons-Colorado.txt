24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Would the material reflect light or appear luminous? And what other details would you include in the appearance as the object which you saw? 
It would appear to be made of a dark colored metallic material, approximately 3 feet in length and about 1 foot in diameter, with a cigar-like shape. It did not appear to reflect light, but had a dull, non-luminous appearance. The object seemed to fade out gradually rather than disappearing abruptly.

Lyons, Colorado
June 18, 1959

Dear Sir:

A flying object was observed near Longmont, Colorado, by several people. Some of the people were able to get a good look at the object and claim that it was a metallic disc-shaped object that hovered for a few minutes and then accelerated and disappeared at a tremendous speed.

The report states that the object was about 20-25 feet in diameter and that it had a flaming exhaust or trail behind it as it accelerated away. The witnesses felt that the object was under intelligent control and that it was not a conventional aircraft or any known type of vehicle.

The report also mentions that some of the witnesses were afraid to come forward and talk about what they had seen, as they were concerned about ridicule or being thought of as "crackpots." However, the report indicates that the witnesses were reliable and credible, and that their accounts should be taken seriously.

The report concludes by stating that the sighting was a genuine unidentified flying object and that further investigation may be warranted.
