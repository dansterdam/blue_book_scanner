Excellent contact, how serious - am sure sighting was authentic. Probably space ship coming or going at some mission. Pilot surely saw plane, but am sure he didn't want to land, come close or have any contact with air traffic. All it was is routine mission of an isolated or unmanned space ship not wanting any contact with air or ground traffic.

This page from a Project Blue Book document contains a photograph or image of a night sky map or star chart. The image shows the relative positions and brightnesses of various stars and constellations, including Orion, Taurus, Auriga, Canis Minor, and Leo, as well as the planets Venus and Mars. The image also includes labels and symbols to indicate the order of brightness of the stars.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
MARS AND VENUS STILL PROMINENT
By February, Mars, the red planet, is still prominent in the southwest sky for a few minutes after sunset or in the early evening. Venus, the evening star, is prominent in the west and increases in brightness until the end of this month. The eclipse track is shown on the star map. It indicates that the path of the eclipse crossed over certain land areas, where they have been organized as great viewing and expedition centers. At the last minute, weather interferes with observations at many stations. This is always a disappointment. However, the eclipse proves valuable scientifically, and serves to awaken the public's interest in astronomy.

GEOPHYSICS

Earth's Dust Cloud
Gathers Motion

BIOLOGY - Earth's dust cloud, extending thousands of miles out in space, is now gathering motion, says Dr. Frederick H. Sill of Harvard College Observatory. He says that space experiments should 'weigh' the earth's atmosphere as well as the moon and planets.

PSYCHOLOGY - Curbstone psychology may be helpful, says Harvard's Dr. Jerome Bruner. He believes that the lunar theory is the most plausible today. About 1,000 or more meteoritic objects a day fall into the atmosphere, and the dust remaining in the dust cloud can be detected from space experiments, he reports.

PHYSIOLOGY - In New Zealand, Keith A. J. Wise is working on the question of the relationship between the dust cloud and weather patterns, which it is believed to influence.

ASTRONOMY - The Antarctic Plateau also being used for astronomical observations, and the team of A. B. Dunstan, a New Zealander, has found approximately two dozen centilobos, or astronomical cameras, at the Plateau. Their observations are reported to have a bearing on the dust cloud surrounding the earth.

BIOCHEMISTRY
UNIQUE PLASMA FRACTION CHECK COPPER POISONING
CERULOPLASMIN, a blue copper-carrying protein found in the blood, has been shown experimentally to act as a protective agent against copper poisoning in animals.
This protein, produced by the liver, is the major copper-carrying protein in the plasma of animals ranging from goldfish to humans. Its level in the blood is a good indicator of copper status, according to a report in Science News Letter, 79:37, January 28, 1961.

ON ANTARCTIC PLATEAU
A NEW ZEALAND party lingers and works on the Antarctic Plateau, Keith A. J. Wise, a New Zealander, has discovered that at this high altitude the highest points are found approximately 6,000 feet above sea level. This is believed to be the highest altitude at which any human being has continuously lived and worked.
