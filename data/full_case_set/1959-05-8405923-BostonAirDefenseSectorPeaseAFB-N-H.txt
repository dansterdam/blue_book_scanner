The image contains a document with a photograph of an unidentified flying object or UFO. The text in the document describes an incident on May 4, 1959 involving "UNKNOWN INCIDENT C223-6052" where several tracks or objects were detected by radar near Pease AFB in New Hampshire. The document provides details about the incident, including the altitude, number of tracks, and other related information. There is no text that identifies any humans in the image.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be an unusual radar sighting. The photograph shows a blurred or obscured object in the sky, which is the subject of the report described in the text below the image.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

1. USAF, ACOTN-BKNG, 10 JUNE 55, UNUSUAL RADAR SIGHTING

1ST LT (AGSM-34/V. D. EWING 1/26 JUN 55
AICO, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO
TO: ACOTN-BKNG

The 4h unidentified targets reported to in this report, they all indicated on the radar scope, increasing in size and finally disappearing completely. The targets were very small, and the most prominent one would be considered about the size of a tank. The fact that the targets were small, indicates that the objects were small. Like wise, the fact that they increased in size and then decreased, is no assurance that the targets were real, as the same effect can be caused by reflections. While the report says nothing definite as to the nature of the targets, it does indicate the possibility of some phenomena which must be considered.

The text from the document is as follows:

FROM: AFION-HEX
REF SECRET ESO PR 26 MORAD DIVISION TO EASTERN NORAD REGION, DID.
5 MAY 59, CITE GOO 4-183. DUE TO THE LIMITED DATA AVAILABLE AND THE ABSENCE OF MATERIAL EVIDENCE, SUCH AS SCOPE PHOTOS, THE ANALYSIS BY THIS HQ HAS NECESSARILY LIMITED. THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED ARE AS FOLLOWS: I. THE FOURTEEN UNIDENTIFIED TRACKS REFERRED TO IN THE REPORT SHOW ALL INDICATIONS OF BEING FALSE TARGETS. II. THE FACT THAT NO SCRAMBLED A/C CONTACTED ANY TARGET CAN BE TAKEN AS ASSURANCE THAT THE TARGETS WERE PROBABLY FALSE. III. THE FACT THAT SEVERAL RADAR BASES SIGHTED THE SAME "TARGETS" IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE TARGETS WERE REAL. IV. WHILE THE REPORT STATES THAT DUCTAC WAS NOT POSSIBLE, THE FACT REMAINS THAT

As an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

Location: Pease Air Force Base, N.H.
Date: 3 May 1959
Hour: 0023-0052
WX: Scattered clouds between 8 and 10 thousand ft.
Description: Five tracks appeared on radar, speeds were 200-400 knots, altitudes from 7-20 thousand ft. with moderate fluctuations. Tracks appeared to be intelligently controlled, highly maneuverable. Tracks formed a circular pattern between 35,000 ft. Some radar and visual contact, then reversed course, high speed. Tracks disappeared.
Direction of Motion: Varied
Satellite: (ARGON-453, Phone 69219)
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): 
Radar Analysis (ARGON-451):
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.):

Evaluation of Source Reliability:
Analysis and Conclusions: The fourteen unidentified tracks referred to in the report showed all indications of being real objects, while the source states this was not possible, the fact remains that they appear to show unexplained returns which must be due to some type of aerial object.
