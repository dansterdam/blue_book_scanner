Gentlemen:

During June 1954, I took two pictures of an unknown flying object, one with a regular Kodak camera and the other with a camera with a telescopic lens. I sent the photographic to be developed, they could not develop them but returned the negatives to me.

I misplaced them and again found them last month (April) and thought that you would be interested in seeing them.

I would be pleased if you would kindly send back the pictures and any reports or records on the sightings of flying saucers that you could give me.

THANK YOU

Lincolnwood 30, Ill.

Dear Allen,

In the process of reviewing June 1954 cases I ran across three sightings: photographic, Mooresville, Indiana; Oologah, Oklahoma and Lincolnwood, Illinois. 

I do not have cases for New Mooresville and Muncie, and the only information I have are the two letters and copies of the Photographic Lincolnwood case.

A note on the Project Card indicates that you evaluated the Mooresville, Indiana case. Could you check these out for me and see if the cases are with your files. Please?

Sincerely,

DAVID N. MOODY

AFOIN-4X3 Dear Mr. [redacted]
AFOIN-4X4
Thank you for your letter of 14 May 1957 submitting two sightings of an unidentified flying object.
AFOIN-4A
This Center has made copies of the negatives and they are now under study by our analysts. However, due to the age and lack of information, it will be very difficult to reach a firm conclusion.
AFOIN-4B
In accordance with Air Force Regulation 200-2, all sightings should be reported to the nearest Air Force Installation for rapid analysis and possible rapid identification. This is any investigation the Air Force conducts.
AFOIN-4C
Inclosed are the two original negatives, the USAF Summary of Events and the latest USAF Press Release.
AFOIN-4D
Your interest in this program is appreciated.
Sincerely,
ROBERT E. O'CONNOR

The provided image appears to be a photograph, though it is a black and white image with a blurry quality. The main feature is a bright, oval-shaped object in the center of the frame, which appears to be the focus of the image. There are no other identifiable objects or details visible in the surrounding area. As per the instructions, I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document.
