Observer stated objects made a noise like jets or rockets and light was steady, no erratic motion. He stated he thought it could have been "jets" taking off.
Investigating officials stated that the 147 Fighter Group, TAC, Air National Guard, had four F-102 take off from Arlington AFB at approximately 1900 to perform an authorized low level fly-by over the city of Houston in connection with Independence Day ceremonies. After the 21-00 was performed between 1900-2000, the F-102s recovered their afterburners and climbed out of the area.

TO: Hq Foreign Tech Div (TDETR)

Reference the attached letter from [redacted] due to the relatively limited information on the sighting. It is difficult to identify the object in question with great certainty. However, taking into account the visibility characteristics described, we believe an object in the vicinity of the upper stage (Scout) of a Transit-2A launch on 14 June 1962 (NORAD object number 519, international designator 1962-034A) may be the one described in the visual report.
