MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, LEGISLATIVE LIAISON, SAFLL
ATTENTION: TEAM "C"

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTINGS, State of Washington

1. Miss H.W., Secretary to Congressman M. from the District, has contacted the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base stating it had been brought to the Congressman's attention that unidentified flying objects in the area of Brewerton, Yakima, Washington, were sighted and reported.

2. These objects were described as red, green, white and blue, and appeared to hover with all lights flickering at night.

3. ATIC contacted the 25th Air Division, McChord Air Force Base, Washington, and requested an investigation of these sightings. The 25th Air Division Intelligence of the 25th Air Division informed ATIC on 15 September 1959, that a single USAF pilot assigned to McChord Air Force Base, Washington, determined that these friendly sightings were normal aircraft conducting routine missions in the area.

4. Will you please inform Congressman M. of the results of these findings, completing the letter to Mrs. M.
