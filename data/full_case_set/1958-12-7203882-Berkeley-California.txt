Dear Dr. -----,

The information contained in your report of your sighting of 28 December 1958 has been reviewed.

I love your suggestion that what you saw was the first sign given to mankind of the flying saucer business on this planet. However, I don't believe there is enough evidence to draw such a conclusion at this time.

Contact was made with the various weather stations to determine the weather conditions at the time of the sighting. Detailed analysis indicates that the balloons released daily at 1500 hours from the University of California at Los Angeles campus would have drifted in the direction of the reported sighting. These balloons, released at this airport, so a position corresponding to the location of your sighting.

These balloons attain a height of greater than 30 feet at the time of their release. They are carried by the prevailing winds, and it has been determined that the balloons have no apparent satellite or rigid structure attached. These balloons are equipped with radar reflectors which could provide a bright image when viewed through binoculars.

Approximating the distance from the balloon track and size of the object or "seven mile through your binoculars", the object you observed was most likely one of the UCLA balloons released that day.

Dear Sirs:

Although I revisited my records on an alleged U.F.O. sighting from my own observation on November 14, 1958, I find that I have no additional information to contribute to the present UFO study.

I would appreciate an answer to my initial letter, in which I attempted to cooperate to the degree that I was capable. The technical interpretation of the visual phenomenon is beyond my capabilities. 

Yours truly,

REPORT OF UFO INCIDENT TO USAF

The object reported sighted on December 11, 1958, approximately 6:35 PM, Pacific standard time, over Richmond, California.

Description:
Three sensed satellite objects variously pulsating
from the total diameter of over one mile to the ssize more
of one searchlight now and again.

(a) Definitely nothing identifiable as aircrafr.
(b) No marked tail.
(c) Movement of units varied from erratically irregular to fairly constant in one direction. One unit drifted out of sight while the others remained in view.

This sighting did not involve the identification of missiles or artificial satellites or devices. As "sensed", they were three separate units of some sort.

The sighting and described event that gave rise to this submission occurred spontaneously and unexpectedly from the witness's own vantage point. The objects sighted and observed were a physical reality, clearly seen and described, and therefore constitute an actual happening rather than a figment of the imagination or wishful thinking.

As indicated in the report, three unidentified objects were observed in the sky for a period of approximately 30 to 45 seconds. The objects appeared to be guided or controlled and exhibited maneuverability beyond the performance capabilities of any known conventional aircraft. They were completely silent and appeared to be disc-shaped. Based on the distance from the witness and other factors, the diameter of each object was estimated to be approximately 50 to 60 feet.

The objects were observed to accelerate at a very high rate of speed and to abruptly change direction of flight, discounting the possibility of these being conventional aircraft, balloons, or other known phenomena. There was no observable trail or exhaust from the objects, and they appeared metallic in nature.

The witness, who is a trained observer with no known history of emotional instability or imaginative tendencies, is considered a credible and reliable source. An investigation was conducted, and the report was submitted to the Air Force authorities handling such matters.

POSSIBLE INDICIA AND INFERENCES:
(a). Elliptical or disc-shaped objects seen which exhibited:
(1) Extremely rapid acceleration.
(2) Abrupt changes in direction of flight.
(3) Apparent metallic construction.
(4) Silent operation.

(b). Objects estimated to be approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter.

(c). Objects observed for approximately 30 to 45 seconds.

(d). Witness considered a credible and reliable observer.

(e). Report submitted to Air Force authorities handling such matters.

(3) "I sighted" due to a loss angulation in the sighting. I am more impressed with the many eye-witnesses who failed to give such a precise description of its movement and size. I feel that the great sighting which I considered was more impressive and well-described.
(5) Here again, I am of the opinion that your description, though quite adequate, does not show the full details of the sighting that I was informed about. That is, the size, speed, angles, and direction of movement were not as clearly defined.

I can't say how to the best of my ability in the matter it was observed. I have impressed the witnesses by what they reported to me, but due to its vast distance from me, I can't consider it as much as it seems.

Yours truly,

Attention: AFOIN-4E2

Dear Sir:

Referring to attached letter, also please refer to Aviation Week issue December 22, 1958, page 24, which reached us after my letter dated December 23, 1959.

If the Thor firing from Vandenberg on September 11, 1958, and if it were delayed more than "scheduled" at about noon but did not come off until about three and a half hours later.

If it were not the Thor firing, it was something else and I answer your queries:

1. Brightness compared to Venus in daylight at greatest brilliancy. This primary object was so bright that the outline of the mountains could be seen against it, without it was some 25 or 30 miles distant. Nothing like it has been seen here before for brilliancy as the basis for determining the magnitude.

2. It should be stated at was preceded by what I after reading the Aviation Week report I note a reference to a "white hot exhaust".

3. This is the time of sightings (within a half hour after) I would guess streak color about that of Arcturus. No pulsations or distinct variations, no flickering, a steady increase in haste then a steady decrease in haste after passing overhead. But also a steady increase in haste then a steady increase in haste when first sighted and when last seen.

4. Unstable condition soon thereafter - within two minutes as well as others steady through binoculars getting an idea being the Redome on Kamloops, and interestingly and getting an idea being the Redome on Kamloops, and interestingly as if you will for me to do.

FURTHER COMMENTS:
If I accept the Aviation Week statement that how do I reconcile the Thor firing stated attitude of 25 degrees? Cause my estimate of 13^ degrees, said variation and give me 29 degrees of error and I get an answer of less than 1500 yards from Vandenberg field through estimating half a mile west from Cloverdale field.

PG.23 2.

On 12 Nov the light was definitely east of my meridian. I must assume that you have disregarded the Thor firing azimuth prior to publication.

Aviation week mentions that the object seemed to depart the origin - I can not determine if information which was deleted from me. The enclosure only shows one frame at original data sheet which was identified report. 

If you can, without violating security, let me know if both I and my wife's report conformed or differ in any way not in full command of our senses and naturally were curious.

Please return my original data sheets after you are finished with them. Thanks.

Yours truly,

Encl: 2
