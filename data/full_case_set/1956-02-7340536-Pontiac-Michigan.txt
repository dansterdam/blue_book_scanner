10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two objects, red, orange, white and blue. Appeared to be at approximately 5,000 feet and heading south at a very slow rate of speed. Still in sight at time of report.

11. COMMENTS
Received by AF Form 112. The sky was completely overcast at the time of the sighting with scattered snow showers. Overcast was at 5,000 feet; therefore, the objects were below that altitude. It is the opinion of this hq that this sighting was possibly generated by balloons. Winds would substantiate this theory as they were from the NNW.
