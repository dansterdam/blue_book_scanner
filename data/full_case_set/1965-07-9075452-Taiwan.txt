7. COURSE: Varies w/Object
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. LOCATION: Taiwan
10. CONCLUSION: BALLOON - AIRCRAFT: Too close to sun for identification as the sunlight reflects off, too small to run for identification, flight and would not move like a balloon out of area. Likely that the phenomena observed characterization on the are in accord with this analysis.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Four objects stationary overhead for 4.5 minute period. At various intervals three other objects observed for 4 minutes, 10 minutes and 1 minute.

UFO SIGHTINGS, 9 Jul and 12 Jul 1965

6987th Security Group 
AFD San Francisco, Calif 96360

1. Four aircraft/satellite like objects observed by analyst on 9 July 1965. Objects appeared to be rotating at high speed and believed to be a balloon.

2. Objects observed on the night of 12 July 1965 were reported as 4 to 5 white lights in a straight line formation, extending across a portion of the sky, according to eyewitnesses. The objects appeared to be moving at extremely high speed and at high altitude, as the satellite appear to be. Additional comments described the objects as varying in size and resembling the satellite-like appearance near stars or planets. In addition, their movements were described as "zig-zagging," "oscillating," and "inverting frequently" which add to the illusion. There are more than thirty satellite-probe systems known to be in orbit, some of which may be visible to the unaided eye, and the objects sighted could possess visible characteristics similar to those described. The identification of the objects was not determined, nor could they be classified as a 'balloon'.
