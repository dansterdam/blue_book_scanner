AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

92727th ACORN GROUP, APO 9-9 1. 6-00-52  PAGE 3 OF 5 PAGES

0000. On the night of 5 September 1952, while on a routine training flight in the vicinity of the 527th AAA Gun Group, APO 9-9, the following incident occurred:

While flying at approximately 10,000 feet, the pilot observed a bright red light which appeared to be hovering at about 5,000 feet some 10 miles north-north-east of his position. This light seemed to be stationary and was described as being conical in shape and changing in color from a bright red to a dim reddish-orange. The light was observed for approximately two minutes and it seemed to expand and contract in size. The pilot stated that he tried to close in on the light but it seemed to move away from his aircraft. The object was then observed to make a very rapid climb and disappear. The pilot estimated the maximum speed of the object to be approximately 800 mph and its maximum altitude to be approximately 25,000 feet.

The pilot reported that he could not identify the object, nor could any known aircraft, balloons, or other normal aerial objects be observed in the area at the time. The following information is based on statements made by the pilot and his observer, who was in the rear cockpit:

The object appeared to be approximately 30-35 feet in diameter, and was conical in shape, the base being larger than the top. The light seemed to pulsate or "breathe" as described by the observer. The color varied from a bright red to a dull reddish-orange, and the object appeared to expand and contract in size during the observation period. The object was observed to make a very rapid climb and disappearance, estimated at a speed of approximately 800 mph and an altitude of approximately 25,000 feet. The pilot and observer were unable to identify the object as any known type of aircraft, balloon, or other normal aerial object. They stated that the object was unlike anything they had ever seen before.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Alleged Sighting of Flying Objects near Kyushu, Japan.

I had just arrived in Kumple at approximately 1630, about one hour prior to the sighting, and inquired to Richard Doughty and George Hayes, both of whom were present at the time, as to what the local rumors were concerning flying discs. They stated that there had been no reports of any such objects in the area. At approximately 1730, Doughty and I were standing outside the entrance to the Airfix office building, and observed 4 bright, shiny objects hovering at an altitude which appeared to be about 1500 to 2000 feet. They were approximately in the same area or of the first sighting. About 1937 this object left the area and disappeared from sight.

On the night of 27 October 1952, I, A/2c George E. Hayes, was on duty in the radio maintenance shop at Ashiya Air Force Base, Kyushu, Japan. At approximately 1730 I glanced out of the window and observed 4 bright, shiny objects hovering at an altitude which appeared to be about 1500 to 2000 feet. After observing the objects for several minutes, they suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. I immediately reported the incident to my supervisor, M/Sgt Doughty, who was also an eyewitness to the occurrence.

I certify that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

On the night of October 27, 1952, at approximately 19:47/I, an unidentified object was observed in the vicinity of Kyushu, Japan. The object appeared briefly before its disappearance. It was a self-illuminated body, spherical in shape, and approached rapidly from the south, emitting blue and yellow lights. The object appeared to be gliding and not powered by any visible means of propulsion. It remained visible for approximately one minute, then suddenly disappeared toward the northeast. It was impossible to judge its size or distance from the observer, but based on its rate of speed and apparent size, the object was estimated to be approximately 50 meters in diameter.

A surveillance balloon, with a light attached to the train, was released by personnel of the 20th Weather Squadron. The point of release was the Kumamoto Airfield at 1746 hours, 29 September 1952. The balloon was tracked by personnel on the ground and ascended to an altitude of about 26,000 feet. At that time, a light on the balloon burst and could no longer be seen. The balloon was tracked until lost from sight at an altitude of about 270 degrees.

2. The three reports give conflicting information as to the location and description of the sightings. These conflicts have been noted.
a. The Kawanishi balloon was launched at 1723Z from Tsuruose air base, 
climbing at 56,000 ft. The last observation was at a point east of Tsushima
by 1842Z. 
b. The night was fairly clear, with stars visible in all directions. 
Scattered, thin clouds were observed in some areas. L Ts or lights were seen moving in a loose cluster, dimming, brightening, and remaining stationary and disappearing at intervals. The movements were erratic and varied.
3. Information received from the Navy Liaison Officer, by FEAF, indicates:
a. Unidentified explosions occurred at 0115 hours, 16th Sept, at several points 15-20 miles east of Pusan (P-3) Korea.
b. Rapid and intensive parachute activity at 30-40 miles east of Pusan (P-3) Korea.
c. Possible explanation of the phenomena may be incidental pyrotechnics used for training purposes.  
4. After the initial C-119 sightings, the other personnel were actually looking at contrails reflecting on unusual night lights.
5. The initial sighting was to the east of Pusan, Korea, as the other nighttime intercepts continued northwest towards Kunsan. No visual contacts of any kind were obtained.
6. Description of the object and its actions vary widely:
a. The C-119 sightings suggest the appearance gave dazzling light being
flashed in a variety of ways, rapidly appearing and disappearing.
b. Other observers reported a "distinct image", steady and hovering
as a point moving from a lower cloud patch to the higher clouds.
c. Scattered patches of light-intense through varying atmospheric conditions.
d. Time and locations of sightings compare closely enough to assume that they were observations of one or possibly two intensely luminous phenomenon.
7. Time and locations of sightings compare closely enough to assume that they were observations of one or possibly two intensely luminous phenomena, different characteristics of which could have been interpreted as one because of varying locations or observers.
8. Occasionally personnel have unknowingly shifted the track from the balloon to the intense light.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Lt (A), 312th Trp Carr Gp (M)    Y 101 

ON October 27th, 1952, while on a routine air lift mission C-119 #151 62nd Troop Carrier Squadron, 314th Troop Carrier Wing observed an unidentified object in the sky approximately 15 miles southeast of K-3. The aircraft was flying VFR at 9,000 feet on a heading of 180 degrees. 

The object was sighted directly to the left and slightly below the C-119, at an estimated air speed of 500 knots.

It was described as being a very bright, white light, having no visible form or characteristics. According to another member of the crew, the light "flared" according to another member of the crew. All testified that it was not a recognized aircraft, and that it appeared to be an unusual concentration of light.

After being under observation for 4-5 minutes by all members of the crew, the object made a sudden ascent to an estimated altitude of 44,000 to 48,000 feet. The weather at this point was clear, with this broken cloud cover of 7,000 to 10,000 feet. The object was observed for a total of approximately 10 minutes.

After reaching this high altitude, the object started a number of gyrations, changing altitude and direction very rapidly, but still remaining to the left of the aircraft.

Five minutes out of CIA intersection (FN 5097) a similar object was seen off the right of the aircraft.

This, too, appeared as a bright, white light. It seemed to be closer to the aircraft and observed to change course abruptly at high speed. Both objects were observed by the crew, one to the left of the aircraft, and one to the right.

after this second sighting, the aircraft turned to a heading of 130 degrees and lost all visual contact with the unidentified objects. During the entire observation, the only change in the C-119 was a slight loss of altitude from 9,000 to 8,500 feet (d-1). At no time, during the entire observation did the second object undergo any observable change in light intensity or shape.

The second object was last seen in the vicinity of Brady AB, FN 3230. The pilot and other crew members discussed any theory that the lights could have resulted from a pocket reflection or flight. It is thought to occur some distance from the aircraft and to have been beyond any atmosphere through which the lights could have passed to minimize the possibility of any other explanation.

Upon re-interrogation, all crew members reported no change in the basic story as outlined above, and specifically as reported by this Headquarters, since three of the five crew members have been more than once re-interrogated. The location of the reported sighting is given as "Ryushu" on 14 July 1952, at 2145L by a combined navigator - radar operator - bombardier, during World War II.

Other crew members interviewed 14 July 1952, 2345 - 0115 (Hr: Min), were Capt Horton, Lt James A. Duntin, and Pfc J. A. Meyers, Lt L. N. Willis, and S/Sgt Gleason. All confirmed the report of their fellow crew member.

There were no reported meteorological phenomena which might account for this reported sighting.

The sighting was confirmed by the fighter pilot sent up by JADP to interrogate the object. This confirmation was orally transmitted by Airmen Walker, who was monitoring the fighter frequency on VHF.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. Intelligence Officer: 22778th ACAU, APO 929 
2. Date: 19-6-52
3. Place: 

Description of Obj ect: A far away star-like light that changed color from blue-green to reddish-yellow and then back to blue-green. The object was observed at intervals of approximately 2-3 minutes. Altitude - object was approximately 40,000 feet and appeared to be stationary or moving very slowly. Size - object appeared to be about the size of a small passenger plane and was estimated to be about 25 miles distant. 

Course of actions The object remained visible for approximately 10 minutes. Then it went out of sight and was not observed again. 

4. Time of Sighting: The object was sighted at 18:50/I and remained in view at intervals until 18:59/I. Total time of sighting was 25 minutes. 

5. Manner of Observation: Was visual (binocular 7 x 50) by duty airman. 

Identifying Information: The reliability of the observer is considered good. He is a trained observer and has had prior experience in making observations of this nature.

Evaluation: As reported, D/F. could not be obtained, as the object made no sound and left no exhaust or sound from the object. 

The only identifying information that could be obtained was the visibility of the object and its location relative to the observer's position. No other identifying details are known.

Cloud Conditions: As reported, winds at approximately 20 to 30 miles and scattered clouds.

Other Activity: No other activity that might account for sighting.

9. Conclusion or Evaluation: Attempted, negative results.

10. Air Traffic: Two F-94's attempted intercept.

Remarks: Information in this report indicates: object was considered unidentified; was not man-made aircraft. It appears to have been a natural phenomenon, possibly a star or planet, which was unusually visible due to atmospheric conditions. The failure of the two F-94's to intercept the object may indicate the object was at a very high altitude.

ON THE NIGHTS OF OCTOBER 27, 1952 WHILE ON DUTY ON THE 1730 TO 0830 HOURS SHIFT, I WITNESSED AND REPORTED A STRANGE LIGHT TO THE SOUTHWEST OF MY STATION. WHILE WORKING MY SHIFT I SUDDENLY OBSERVED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR AT INTERVALS. IT APPEARED TO VIBRATE OR OSCILLATE SLIGHTLY BACK AND FORTH IN A LIMITED ARC. THE LIGHT WOULD MAINTAIN A STEADY BRILLIANCE FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN DIMINISH AND PRACTICALLY DISAPPEAR, ONLY TO REAPPEAR AGAIN. THIS PERFORMANCE WAS REPEATED OVER AND OVER AT INTERVALS OF APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 30 SECONDS. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE CONTROLLER ON DUTY, WHO IN TURN NOTIFIED THE AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON, AIR DEFENSE COMMAND, ACTING ON THE INFORMATION, THE CONTROLLER DISPATCHED A SCRAMBLE TO INVESTIGATE THE LIGHT.  WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THE PILOT REPORTED BACK THAT HE HAD OBSERVED THE LIGHT BUT WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE ON IT EVEN AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. HE STATED THAT AS HE APPROACHED THE LIGHT IT WOULD MOVE RAPIDLY AWAY MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO CLOSE ON IT AND EXAMINE IT CLOSELY.

I had just arrived in supply at approximately 1830, about one or two hours earlier than usual. Together with a group toward the north guard tower, I stood and watched in the direction of the tower, as DID up operators what was going on. When I arrived at the tower, I found the operators pointing up to a bright light in the sky - it moved up and down, back and forth and in circles - the operators claimed that it had been there for about 15 minutes and then disappeared. They said it was too high to have been a searchlight and the movement of the light was far too irregular for an aircraft. I watched this light myself for several minutes. It moved up and down, back and forth, and described large and small circles - then, after a period of time, it just disappeared. 

EDDIE L. JOHNSON
2/Sgt, USA

On the night of the 27 October 1952, I A/3C George M. Haynes, was standing on the ground near the DUG tower, on the south side of the tower, watching a strange light in the sky. It seemed to move back and forth and up and down at irregular intervals. The light was a bright white in color and seemed to appear and disappear at will. I climbed upon the top of the DUG tower and looked at the light with field glasses. I noted that the light was stationary at times and at other times moved around erratically. I discussed this sighting with A/1C William T. Smith, A/3C George M. Haynes, and A/2C Delbert R. Johnson. We all agreed that the light was very strange and was not an ordinary aircraft. The light finally disappeared behind the mountain west of this station.

On the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty in the radio maintenance section, Major D/F A/2C John Hynek called me up to the D/F tower. I observed a bright blue-white light in the sky to the east-southeast. This light seemed to dart back and forth and up and down, erratically. It did not appear to be an aircraft or other known object. I watched this through field glasses and it finally disappeared behind the mountain to the west of this station.

ON the night of Cactober 27, 1952 at approximately 2135Z, a bright object was observed in the vicinity of Kyushu Island, Japan. The object was first seen at about 2135Z while the observer was proceeding to the vicinity of Sasebo, Kyushu for a training flight. The object appeared to be round and quite bright, maneuvering erratically before around his vicinity. At approximately 2140Z the object took on a pillar or cigar shape, and at this time it appeared to be approximately 10 miles from the observer. The object then extended outward into 2 smaller lights, then back into the original shape. This was repeated several times in rapid succession, and it was impossible to judge the size or altitude of the object. The speed was fantastic and the object suddenly disappeared,only to reappear again in the same area. No sound was heard and it left no trail. To the best of the observer's knowledge, there was no trail, exhaust or burning. The object disappeared, reappeared, and disappeared again. It seemed to be coming toward this station, do not know what it was.

Just I spotted it with a pair of 7/50 binoculars while I was standing guard. The flight path of the object took it approximately 10 miles away, and I continued to observe it until it disappeared from view, which was about 2-3 minutes later. The object appeared to be round and quite bright, maneuvering erratically, and changing shape several times. The speed was fantastic and the object suddenly disappeared, only to reappear again in the same area. No sound was heard and it left no trail. To the best of the observer's knowledge, there was no trail, exhaust or burning.

The above report is a statement of what I saw on the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty here at Sebuli/Japan D/F.

THEY MOVED IN AN ERRATIC MANNER, CHANGING SPEED AND DIRECTION VERY RAPIDLY. SOMETIMES THEY WOULD HOVER, THEN DART OFF IN A ZIGZAGGING FASHION AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEEDS. AT ONE POINT, TWO OF THE OBJECTS CONVERGED AND APPEARED TO MERGE, THEN SEPARATED AGAIN.

3. THE SIGHTING LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES. TOWARD THE END OF THE SIGHTING, THE NUMBER OF OBJECTS INCREASED TO SEVEN OR EIGHT. THERE WERE NO SOUND OR EXHAUST TRAILS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECTS.

4. THE WEATHER AT THE TIME WAS CLEAR, WITH GOOD VISIBILITY. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED VISUALLY AND ALSO ON RADAR. IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SIGNIFICANCE TO THIS SIGHTING. THE REPORT HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO HIGHER HEADQUARTERS.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Detailed information regarding the unidentified object referred to in part 1 of this report is as follows:

1. The object was described by four (4) observers in two (2) separate incidents. The observers were members of the Military Personnel of the 10th Fighter Bomber Squadron and the 5th Weather Squadron, stationed at Itazuke Air Base, Fukuoka, Japan.

2. The object was described as being approximately 20-25 feet in diameter, silver or white in color, circular in shape, and appeared to be suspended in the air. The object was seen at close range and they were convinced it was a star they saw. In all cases there were negative aerodynamic features, negative sound, and negative evidence of propulsion.

3. The matter that Lt Royner observed did not answer or return signals. The object that Lt Baldwin saw on one occasion disappeared and reappeared at a different position, indicating no physical substance and rapid maneuverability.

4. The object was observed for periods of time ranging from 2 to 15 minutes by the various observers and at distances from 1 to 3 miles.

5. Attempts were made by both aircraft to intercept and identify the object, but the object maneuvered quickly away and all attempts were unsuccessful.

Concern Yellow, as P-51D was airborne on a Combat Air Patrol at 17,000 ft. Bolling, when it was noticed approximately 1750 ft below that an unidentified craft was following the P-51D. The craft was traveling at 500-600 mph and was identified as a silver, circular, extremely bright object. 
When it was still dusk, with Concern Yellow near BRADY Air Field, a G-13 type called SHIKAN-OCIIM KOKU OCO 211 N and 120 C 154 2, that he was watching a fast-moving, fast-climbing object, and reported that the object then disappeared, off in the direction where Concern Yellow had been.
Reportedly sighted to 20,000 feet and flew on a heading of 360° from BRADY Air Field, at 21,000 ft a speed of 600-900 mph. Though the object may have appeared more distant, pilot inadvertently let the object slip by as he was concentrating on observing the object rather than turning to attack it. However, pilot inadvertently drifted away from the object and lost sight of it.
At 2,000 to 1,000 yards, the object looked like a white light, flashing alternately bright and dim at a steady rate. Object appeared to be heading north-easterly, directly away from 2,000 to 3,000 yards.
Following was heading 090° and object appeared to be heading northeasterly at about 1230 or 1235. Under observer and exclaimed that it looked like a body was making a head-on pass. Radar Controller Observer said then the object had disappeared completely and unexpectedly.
22-52-52 object turned port and climbed to a very high altitude. It then turned to the right and appeared as if it were a star. Pilot informed OGO that it was a star.

REPORT NO: 10-9169370-N

INVESTIGATING OFFICER: Second Lieutenant Harold Goldman, AO 2 223 937 

PLACE OF INCIDENT: Kyushu, Japan

DATE OF INCIDENT: 27 October 1952

Friendly was making practice instrument approaches on identified aircraft on 27 October 1952, by Second Lieutenant Harold Goldman, AD 2 223 937. 

2nd Lt Goldman was airborne on a Combat Air Patrol at 17,001. 

Friendly was making practice instrument approaches on identified aircraft at 17,001 - 20,000' and 13,000' - 17,001' over HAKODA Air Field, 35° - 40' N and 130° - 22' E.

Air Force personnel were instructed to investigate unidentified flying object 50 miles north of ASHIYA Air Force Base, 339° - 33' N and 130° - 22' E. This friendly aircraft made visual contact but could not close to get a good identification. 

This friendly aircraft at one point came to a point 20 miles north of ASHIYA, then climbed to about 22,000' and circled the object. The object appeared somewhat elliptical and was emitting a pulsating light that would be seen for a few seconds, then disappear, then reappear in another position. There were 3 stars behind the object. Friendly attempted to close again for identification but the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared. 

Friendly then took up a heading of 210° and object no longer appeared to be in visual contact. Friendly was descending and object disappeared at approximately 17,000'.

As friendly was returning to ITAZURE Air Force Base, 330° - 33' N and 130° - 22' E, a second object appeared to be at 9,500 feet and this object also disappeared.

NARRATIVE REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ON 27 OCTOBER 1952, BY PILOTS OF F-94C INTERCEPTOR AIRCRAFT 339TH FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON, 51ST FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR WING, KYUSHU, JAPAN.

Confers Green, an F-94C, took off at 1830I on a scramble, 1st Air Division, and about 30 minutes later, Confers Green was airborne.

As soon as he was airborne, the Pilot called SHTOANG-SHMA GCI (Ground Control Intercept) and informed them he was proceeding to intercept the object.

Confers Green reported to Confers Green that the object was then at 2 o'clock high and 10 miles distant. He then closed to within 1 mile of the object but was not able to close any further as the object began rapidly climbing and disappeared from sight. This was reported to CGI who then asked for identification of the object.

Confers Green climbed with all power to 12,000 feet, still in contact with the object, but was unable to gain any further ground. The object was proceeding in a generally southerly direction.

On its way toward BRADY Air Field, Confers Green notified another bright star 2 o'clock from his position.

GCI station instructed Confers Green to follow and continue interception. However, at 2025I Confers Green's fuel state was low and BRADY Air Field cleared him to return. BRADY Air Field received him on a heading of 030 at 12,500 feet.

The object which Confers Green was tracking was last seen through a thick haze layer and was changing color and motion rapidly up to 40,000 feet, but nothing else was reported. Pilot and Radar Observer are of the opinion that the object was a star or other heavenly body.

Amendment to Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952 by 1st Lt Charles R. Dondon, Radar Observer:

Upon picking up the light visually, the Radar Observer attempted to pick up and lock on the target with the radar. Although no return was picked up by the radar, the interference appeared in the approximate azimuth of the object as seen by the pilot and the hand control. The pilot then lost sight of the object. 

This took place shortly after take off and sighting of the light. The Radar Observer did not have time to check the calibration of the set.

After the Pilot and Radar Observer identified the object as a star, the Radar Observer confirmed the star to be the same position and that interference could be produced by moving the hand control rapidly in azimuth, elevation, and sensitivity and gain.

This rapid movement was very similar to the tactics used by the Radar Observers in attempting to pick up the unidentified object.

The foregoing was a true and complete amendment to the narrative of the flight to confirm the sighting from 1952 to 2031 on 27 October 1952.

Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by Second Lieutenant Eugene F. Balowski, Jr. AC 2
Contacts Patrol aircraft, AF 2,906 air forces on a coastal air patrol at 17,000 feet, and Lt Baldwin, Pilot.
Lt Baldwin, intercepts an unidentified aircarft, the visibility of which was "GOOD". The aircraft's speed was "300 to 240 M.P.H." and its altitude was "BELOW 1,000 FEET" FROM THE PATROL AIRCRAFT.
When Lt Baldwin was still descending to intercept the object, the object was turning and appeared to be "YELLOW-ORANGE IN COLOR" and "12' to 13' IN SIZE". It was still descending when Lt Baldwin gave the order to turn away. After being informed that the object was investigated, the Patrol was instructed not to engage the object further.
Friendly tracks the object from 20,000 feet and flew on a heading of 360 degrees for 55 miles. The object was a single unit, 42 to 50 miles from the patrol, and it later turned toward the patrol and appeared to inspect the patrol aircraft and display his lights. The patrol refused to follow the object further.
At first contact pilot reports the object looked as big as a "FRIENDLY FIGHTER, about 12 to 15 feet in length, long slender fuselage and wings, and a red and green light on the tail, blinking on and off." The object appeared to be a metallic color and was descending at a 2,500 to 3,000 foot per minute rate.
Friendly was heading 090 and object appeared to be heading directly behind friendly for approximately 3 minutes. "RADAR could not pick up the object." Pilot noticed the object disappeared completely and the Radar Observer agreed the object had disappeared.
After object disappeared, Friendly turned and climbed to 24,000 feet. The pilot stated that the object was a "star." Pilot informed that he noticed strobe lights on the object, which gave the impression it was a "star."
Friendly turned toward the object for identification for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Then the object increased speed to "MORE THAN THAT OF FIGHTER AIRCRAFT" and climbed to over 45,000 feet. Pilot's light was insufficient to see the object clearly and he could not get "LOCK-ON" and told them "that he had a 'VERY FAST' OBJECT IN SIGHT."
Friendly turned away when the object climbed past 45,000 feet. The object was descending at a high rate of speed and appeared much smaller as it went out of sight, indicating a speed "FAR IN EXCESS OF 600 M.P.H." and was estimated to be about 50 miles away when last observed.

That, after, and intercept friendly was instructed to investigate
unidentified targets originally assigned to ADTAC Air Forces Radar, 330 - 53' N and 136 - 40' E, at 20,000 feet called to CGI by a D-119.
When controller ground controlled friendly to a point north of ASHIYA a
bright light was noticed by the flight. The light was observed to friendly
turn into an object and then disappear. The object reappeared to friendly
and was observed to approximately 22,000 feet from 19,000 feet and was then
positive that the object was not their own aircraft.
Friendly then took up a heading of 2100 and object no longer appeared to be
following friendly. Friendly was descending and climbing but object did not
appear again. A master caution light in the cockpit of the F-119 came on
and 5 minutes later it went off as Friendly approached TATSUNA Air Force
Base, 130 - 25' N and 130 - 57' E. The light came on again and the
information was reported to Confirm Green who took over the chase.

The foregoing was a true and complete narrative of the flight of Confirm
Green from 1745 to 1956t on 27 October 1952.

Confirm On, as F-94 was "scramble", 1st Lieutenant Catchell to 1,000 on a Scramble, 1st Lieutenant Smoot.
(O5:55) Logged as he was airborne, the pilot called SHIGANO-SHIMA GOC (Control) advising they had a target indicated 17 miles 315 degrees from Shigano-Shima, closing in, Course and speed not confirmed. GOC control advised to continue follow for a briefing. (Confirm follow was a previously airborne F-94)
FIGHTER SHIGANO-SHIMA GOC Confirm Green was as then seen the object was then BRADY Air Field, now beyond radar range. GOC continued to advise the object was still under observation as it changed course and headed south, gaining altitude with speed.
It was at this time the bright light referred to as the object, was seen by the body. The light was on a trailing of scope camera shutter near the rear fire nozzle. The light was smooth in outline, bright yellow for a briefing.
Confirm Confirm Green headed 220°, climbing with afterburner to 33,000 feet. Object continued to a point estimated 7-12 miles beyond BRADY Air Field, then disappeared. Aircraft landed with full tanks and normal landing.
As this time (19:05) Pilot identified "bogies" of object no longer observed. Friendly identification was accomplished by a check of all aircraft in the area. As this time (19:05) Pilot identified "bogies" of object no longer observed.
On the way toward BRADY Air Field Confirm Green noticed another GOC then called Confirm Green and instructed them to continue responsible for object was still under observation by GOC. They readled over 90 miles. The 30 miles in position where the object was first sighted has 0 indicated. The object was tracked by GOC for 20 miles to the position where the object was last seen.
The object was lost seen when Confirm Green was 30 miles NW of BRADY Air Field. It was observed in the sky still at a bearing of 220° from SHIGANO-SHIMA, with an elevation above the horizon of 5-10°.
The light was last seen through a break in the clouds and was changing color rapidly.
Pilot and radar observer are of the opinion that the object was a star or other heavenly body.

Upon picking up the light visually, the Radar Observer attempted to pick up and track the object with the radar. Although no return was picked up on the radar, the Radar Observer continued in his attempts to track the object. The bright light was observed to suddenly disappear. The Radar Observer reported this to the Bomber Commander.

This rapid maneuver led the Radar Observer to take off and sighting of the light. The Radar Observer did not have time to check the operation of the equipment.

The sighting was terminated and the aircraft returned to base.
