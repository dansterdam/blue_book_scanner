SUBJECT: Flying Saucer.

TO: Commanding General
Army Air Forces
Washington 25, D. C. 
ATTN: AC/AS-2
Lt Colonel George Garrett

1. The specimen of an alleged "Flying Saucer" brought to this Command by Colonel H. M. McCoy, which were obtained by the FBI and given to Lt. Col Garrett, were examined to determine their connection, if any, with the so-called "Flying Saucers", or any project at AMC, Wright Field. The specimens were carefully examined by both technicians of the Analysis Division (T-2) and Electronics Sub-division (T-3). The latter organization stated that these specimens definitely had no connection whatsoever with the "Mogul" project nor with any other research and development project of this Command.

2. It is also the opinion of this Command that these specimens have no connection with the so-called "Flying Saucers" or Discs. These specimens, therefore, are considered as part of a hoax that has been perpetrated by most anyone seeking publicity or for any other reasons.

3. The specimens shown in the attached photograph include fragments of an undeterminable shape made from plaster of paris or similar material and containing some electrical resistance wire for measurement or heating purposes. The condition of the ceramics indicates that the resistance wire was heated electrically at one time or another. These fragments could not be connected with any AMC project. The other articles at the top of the photograph reading from left to right are identified as follows:

3. An outmoded type of magnetic speaker diaphragm made of aluminum alloy, manufactured by the Nathaniel Baldwin Company of Salt Lake City, Utah, which was first patented May 1, 1910. This article cannot be connected with any AMC project.

b. The second and third articles are bakelite coil forms

Package received from Sheriff Merle T. Wilmeth, Watseka, Ill. His letter states the instrument in the package was found by a farmer at Danforth, Ill. It landed in the middle of a section of his farm land and burned weeds 20 feet tall to fine ash an area of 12 feet in diam. around where the object dropped.

The Instrument consists of:

(a) Plaster of paris body having an oval cavity thru it.

(b) A power microphone which screws over one end of the oval cavity. The power microphone carried the name, "Nathaniel Baldwin Inc." Salt Lake City, Utah. Pat May 10 1910 & Jept. 1, 1916. Pat 103 957403 (second number not readable)

(c) A small "Polymat" filter condenser.

(d) Two bakelite cylinders to which is attached a net work of fine copper wires. These were obviously coils and the impact has torn the wires from the cores. (Our radio section definitely states that this is old stuff, or the coils were used quite some time ago, since having been replaced by smaller more efficient coils)

(e) A piece of metal having magnetic properties obviously broken off the power microphone as a result of the impact.

The plaster of paris body was broken up by the impact but some of the pieces were held together by wire reinforcement inside the plaster of paris.
