To certain individuals:

On the night of the day: 3rd September 1962, at around 6:00 P.M. my wife and I were traveling toward home on the San Diego Freeway, just south of the Falso Verdes, California, turnoff. While proceeding in the right lane at about 50 mph, my wife suddenly exclaimed that she had observed a strange object in the sky. I immediately looked up and saw a large, white, round object which appeared to be hovering or floating approximately 300-400 yards off the road at an altitude of 500 feet, more or less.

The object was perfectly spherical in shape and appeared to be about 20-25 feet in diameter. It was quite brilliant and light in color, and gave the impression of being translucent or semi-transparent. There were no visible markings, protrusions, or wings of any kind.

The object simply hovered or floated, remaining stationary for some 20 seconds or more, and then began moving in a southwesterly direction at an extremely rapid rate of speed, leaving no trail and accelerating instantly to an unbelievable velocity. As it moved away, the object gradually began to diminish in size and brightness, and then suddenly disappeared completely from sight.

Both my wife and I experienced a profound sense of awe and bewilderment at this strange phenomenon. We were quite certain that what we observed could not have been any known type of aircraft or other conventional object. The experience was both exciting and unsettling, and we are still at a loss to explain or rationalize what we saw.

Extracting the text:

Eskimo paper, flying object 6:45 p.m. 3 october 1957. The witness was in his car and stopped on the way home from work near the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and Palos Verdes Drive in Palos Verdes, California. He states that he saw an object which appeared to be disc-shaped and was hovering silently at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. The object was estimated to be about 50 to 100 feet in diameter. It appeared to have a brilliant white light in the center and a hazy glow around the edges. The witness observed the object for about 5 minutes before it silently accelerated and disappeared in the direction of the ocean. The witness reported the incident to the police shortly thereafter. No other witnesses were identified.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output of the text in the document:

Great was the surprise of all of us when we saw this mysterious object which hovered over the ocean for about 15-20 minutes. It appeared to be a bright light, bigger than a star and seemed to be stationary. There were no wings or appendages visible. This was a clear night and the moon was not out. The object appeared to be hovering, and then it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared. There were some other strange phenomena connected with this sighting, but I don't feel free to discuss them at this time.

Sincerely,
