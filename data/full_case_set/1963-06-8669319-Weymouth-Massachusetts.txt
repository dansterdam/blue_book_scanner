The text in the document states:

stretch across a field in back of their house, until it disappeared from view. "However, (Mrs. "X") was so shaken she could not get to sleep," he said. "We talked about it until 4:30 A.M.".

Mrs. "X" called the Naval Air Station around 8:30 A.M. and someone there took her name and telephone number saying they would call her later, but no call came. Both Mr. and Mrs. "X" distinctly asked their neighbors if they had heard a sound during the night. The three neighbors they asked all had heard a loud sound but did not get out of bed to look as they had dismissed it as a low-flying jet.

At first the "X's" were reluctant to tell anyone what they had seen. Later, after the Patriot Ledger, a local Quincy newspaper, published a photo taken by one of its reporters of a UFO in the sky that same night (July 25th) along with reports of visual sightings of a UFO, the "Gilbert's" told their story to the Patriot Ledger (See photostat of news-clipping attached to data sheet).

The "Gilbert's" said they had no idea what the object could have been but were certain it was not an airplane or a helicopter. Both families (The "Gilbert's" and the "X's") were sincere and my brother and I were convinced that they had seen and/or heard what they had described - an Unidentified Flying Object.

Yours Sincerely,

Flying "Object" Mystory spzens With New Reports
Weymouth, Newland - The area around Pleasant Point, near the Gibbs School, has been the scene of repeated sightings of the "flying object" mystery in recent weeks. 
Mrs. Mary L. Cline of 12 Short St. Whitman, said she saw the "object" on several occasions, around 9 p.m. She described it as round, with flashing lights. 
"They didn't seem to surprise us. The lights were just there, changing color, blue, orange, yellow, green - all different colors. It wasn't a plane or satellite," she said. 
The "object" was seen by others, mostly young people, in the area, she reported. It appeared to remain stationary, then move swiftly across the sky. 
On one occasion, Mrs. Cline said, she saw it go behind some trees, then reappear. 
"It was much bigger and brighter than a star and would not disappear," she said. "It was so strange. I would not say it was a UFO, but I don't know what else to call it."
The sightings were first reported several weeks earlier on June 8. 
The police said they had received calls reporting the "object", but there was nothing they could do about it.
All these reports followed the first sighting, which was reported to the police by Roy E. Bates, a local resident. 
Bates said he saw a bright light in the sky near the Gibbs School one evening in early June. He said the light appeared to be hovering and then moved rapidly away.
"It was much bigger than a plane and brighter," he said. "When I first saw it, I thought it was an airplane on fire, but there was no sound."
The sightings have continued, Bates reported, with several other people reporting seeing the strange light in the sky.

Information on 26 June 1963
Saith Weymouth, Mass.

On June 26, Mr. and Mrs. Enrico Gil-
bert of East Weymouth spotted a UFO
while driving. They reported the
sighting to the Weymouth Police Station
at 12:05 A.M. According to the report,
the authority who took the report "didn't
seem too impressed." The description of
the sighting: Both Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert
described the craft as "very large."
Higher than a truck, with a brilliant white
light and dark colored "arms or wings"
protruding from the sides. They said
the object flew "with a humming sound"
about 100 feet from the ground, after
the tension wires near the Gilbert home. It
then, Gilbert said, "was lost discending
into the nearby trees." Gilbert described
two or more exactly, two saucers in-
volved. He said they made two or three
circles some 100 feet in the air, then "took
off fast and rapidly disappeared as if
it had shot up into the air like a rocket."
Gilbert said the rear was deafening. "Up
went two silver things of these people.
They were flying and hovering as usual. 
It and it was some sort of machine, not
a balloon or some other explanation."

Mr. [redacted]
Attleboro, Massachusetts

Dear [redacted],

Thank you for your letter of July 17. I was very glad to get the clipping. I heard about this UFO but had not seen a copy of it until your letter arrived.

There are many different ways in which this UFO could have come about. First of all, it could not have been a firm object or an extremely brilliant light. On seeing it, the person might have had a very brief impression that gave an illusion that there was a 'light' of some sort. First of all this can happen in the day time. Phase may be due some fault in the dioptrics or the human eye itself. The person might have had a momentary distraction and failed to see the light again. It used to point to a fairly bright light. The author might not have seen it again, I know of it Unidentally aimed at the ship's orbit. As in focusing or unfocusing the camera, he might have inadvertently exposed the film. It would be interesting to know whether this view first obtained the first film on the case. Something has obviously photographed it. There have been many similar and unexpected developments related to UFOs, some very similar to this example.

Sometimes the light comes from a flashlight, but I would like to know whether he used a flashlight or not. Something shine in the lens. will shine indirectly reflecting perhaps from a wristwatch or a ring. The fact that some one of our Unidentified light considered sufficiently unusual to photograph it seems more important than whether this particular instance was manifestly inaccurate and probably spurious. The erratic or irregular motions are more important than whether the object was of the usual platonic child. The argument about the could devices have found in this manner cannot be concluded with confidence as it does not depend on visual saucers. Nor would it completely roll out the 'playful child'. The argument about these objects does not contain any conclusion as it involves a statement that could make no sense. I should also like to ask the photographer whether his camera is an accidental discovery. I am trying to eliminate the possibility of an accidental event.

He states that "what is photographed was definitely in the sky." He further states that he kept the camera as in 'constant view'. But he also said that he had not seen the object with the initial glance. It was definitely in the sky or missed it, means it was first glanced at, then left the camera's view.

UFO Photo Baffles
Astronomer At B.U.

BOSTON-The mysterious, well-lighted object which appeared to three persons in Weymouth, Mass., on the evening of June 26 has been photographed by an astronomer at Boston University.
The astronomer, who declined to be identified, said the object looked like a "flying saucer" and that its underside "had a very complicated pattern."
The object was sighted by Mrs. Doris Bingham, a Braintree housewife, and two companions who have not been identified. They reported seeing the object hovering over a Weymouth backyard for about an hour.
The astronomer said his study of the photograph "supports" the accounts of the three witnesses. He said the film showed an object with "a very bright light underneath" and that the "complicated pattern" was visible on the underside.

I definitely discount the statement of Putnam concerning the report of the two West Quincy sites. There have been some complaints of this sort. Does he not at least produce a pre-dated paper reporting this siting by the nearby public?

Sorry to be such a skeptic. I don't know whether any group is checking up on the sightings. They should not normally be doing so unless he actually sent pictures to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. There may be some confirming evidence of any sighting. But if he is an experienced photographer, he should send me a copy of any letters or something. I therefore, resending a copy of your letter.

Incidentally, you may be interested to know that my new book, "The World of Flying Saucers," published by Doubleday, written jointly by myself and Mrs. Evie Byrde, will be on the bookstands in just a few days. I deal with photographic matters.

Thanking you for your interest, I am

work, he said.

The light was a brilliant orange nucleus, which seemed to be a central portion, much brighter than the matter which surrounded it. This matter seemed to be what caused the object to appear somewhat hazy, irregularly shaped and larger than it would have if the nucleus alone had been visible.

Apparently the light of the object would be invisible on the slide, as it was, but as a visual phenomenon, it was very bright. Obviously the lights were not caused by reflection since there were no shadows, and the object illuminated the surroundings.

The observation lasted about 3 minutes according to the witness. As the object appeared to move away, it gradually faded out, until at infinity, thus ruling out its being a searchlight beam focused in the distance.

The witness, who has had extensive experience in aircraft work and photography, states emphatically that it was a Solid body. It made no sound, and there was no tail, exhaust or other features indicating it was some type of aircraft or vehicle. He is certain it was not a meteor or a reflection, and the details he saw rule out its being any type of conventional aircraft.

From the description, the size and entrance trails of the object indicate that whatever it was, it was larger than the largest jet aircraft. It was, in his estimation, an accelerating vehicle for a descent, from a high altitude, that occurred at Weymouth, Mass., near Boston, August 18, 1953.

AFROC photo analysis by Dr. John C. Hopf, AFROC photo analysis lab chief, has not yet been accomplished concerning this case as of this date. However, from a preliminary analysis of the film image of some light source, we have tentatively ruled out its origins as that of a conventional aircraft or vehicle. The size, speed and other factors indicate the possibility of the object being some form of solid body behind the light. It would appear from the evidence that this was a genuine unidentified flying object. Until such time as the film analysis is accomplished, we are unable to determine precisely the nature and purpose of one of the above.

Another important observation was made by the chief project engineer, APRO member and President of the local UFO Group, Mr. Raymond H.
Estrada. He stated that several witnesses saw the object from the ground, and appeared to make do degree turns without turning itself, the object remaining fully illuminated and unchanged in brightness as it changed directions. This indicates the possibility of a very advanced type of propulsion, if this observation is accurate.

The Patriot-Ledger said that, a three-hour study of the slides showed that the lights seemed hazy and not well defined, indicating their source was a luminous area rather than a point of light. They also said the object appeared to move rapidly, at times tilting, but never changing its relative brilliance.

After 'Pathlier's' story the Patriot-Ledger reported an account in the daily Boston Record that a number of persons including Dr. Daniel S. Green of the Boston University Observatory "would hesitate to say the photographs will admit of no other explanation." It is very difficult to explain the phenomenon, one of them said. "If there is something out there, as the photograph seems to show, it eludes some of the star trails. None of the trails in the picture were disturbed."

The Patriot-Ledger also commented that the photo is not very clear and that there are some doubts about whether bona fide UFO pictures are obtainable by amateur cameras. But they did say that it may indicate the existence of some sort and it is very unfortunate that the photograph and the story were not clearer. The analysis of the slide does not shed any particular light to date and the complicated matter of identification remains unsettled.

It is interesting that the Patriot-Ledger attempted to qualify its statements, indicating that they do not put too much credence in the report unless confirmed by further investigation, analysis and evaluation. As is often the case, uncertainty and lack of final explanation leave room for conjecture.

On the evening of July 28, 1963 my brother and I interviewed two families on Commercial Street, East Weymouth, Massachusetts in regard to the sighting of an unidentified flying object which was seen, heard, and photographed in the Southshore area during the night of June 25th and the early morning hours of June 26, 1963.

Attached is a photostat of a completed UFO Data Sheet which is based upon a USAF Technical Information Sheet. The drawings on the UFO were done by Mr. Sawatzki as we went through the form together objectively filling in the information. Both Mr. and Mrs. were signed the completed form. The following is a brief account of our interview with them and a family who live next door.

THE INTERVIEW - Street
Mr. and Mrs. were awakened about 1:00 A.M. on June 26, 1963 by an "um-godly sound - like a slow moving jet" - in the heat they could describe it. Their bed was pulled up to the back window so as to keep cool. Their heads were near the window and they both looked out. Mrs. observed the UFO and was terrified, jumping under the covers. Mr. observed the object for approximately one minute. He said, was like "two hamburger buns one on top of another with a sandwiched piece of meat protruding around." Its outline was seen because of two lights on the object; one on the top and one on the bottom which were shaped like "Turkish Fez hats". It hovered momentarily, slowly moved at a height of about 100 feet over trees about 300 feet away, crossed lower lines.
