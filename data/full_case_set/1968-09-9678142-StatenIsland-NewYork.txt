Text from the document:

Dear Mr. -:

This replies to your letter of September 30, 1968, in which you reported that you had seen some unidentified flying objects.

Without additional information, I cannot offer an explanation of what you observed. However, if you are still interested in this matter, the staff at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to discuss it with you.

Should you have other sightings of unidentified flying objects, please report them to the Chief of Staff, Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, as such reports are essential to the on-going UFO investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking into the sightings of others reported to USAF in the area. I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. DIXON
MAJOR, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Directorate of Information Division

Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir:
I saw four (4) objects at about 7:30 P.M. on April 30, 1968. They appeared to be in a straight line and remained in the same position for about 15 minutes. The objects were white in color and had a bright light in the center. They seemed to be at a high altitude. When one of the objects would flicker, the others would flicker also. I could not make out any shape or size. The objects finally disappeared from view one at a time.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]
