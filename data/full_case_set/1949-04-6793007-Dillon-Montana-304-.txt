DETAILS:

1. On 6 April 1949, this office received a memorandum from a reliable government agency concerning information pertaining to this alleged sighting of an unconventional aircraft, so-called "Flying Discs." This office conducted interviews of persons that were alleged to have observed the object and invesu̲a̲tions at A̲F̲ ̲Form̲ ̲112̲ ̲are not available at this Air Force Base, the following report is submitted;

AT DILLON, MONTANA.

On 3 April 1949, Mr. ------- who owns and operates a construction company at Dillon, Montana, reported sighting an object commonly known as a "Flying Disc" at approximately 1150 hours, 3 April 1949. At the time of the observation alleged appearance of the object, was standing in the yard of his construction company located approximately one mile southwest of Dillon, Montana, facing north and at approximately 1,150 hours, 3 April 1949, saw what appeared to be a "Flying Disc" at an altitude of approximately three to five thousand feet over the northern part of the city of Dillon, Montana, and approximately four miles north of Mr. ------'s position depending upon the known city limits of the city of Dillon of four to five feet in diameter through the aperture. The objects at the time of sighting appeared to be rocking or rotating in a semi-circular motion. It appeared to be constructed of metal such as aluminum and was bright on the upper side and reflected sunlight, the lower side appeared to be a bluish-gray or greenish-gray, which did not reflect light. The shape of the object was that of a plate or disc placed upon another inverted plate or disc. The edges of the disc were believed to be exceedingly thin with considerable thickness in the middle.

The object, after rocking from side to side for at least several completed arcs, proceeded in an easterly direction and descended rapidly from the height at which it was first observed down to an altitude of approximately 200 or 300 feet at which it again started the rocking motion. After rocking a few times and reflecting light each time, the upper side came into view, and then moved rapidly in a southwesterly direction to a position approximately 1000 feet in altitude and two miles west of Dillon, Montana, at which time it again started the rocking motion. After rocking a few times, it proceeded rapidly to a position above the airport of Dillon, Montana, at approximately a 1000 foot altitude and twelve miles northeast of Dillon, Montana. The object again rocked a few times and rapidly disappeared over and beyond the mountains east of Dillon, Montana.

The object did not show evidence of exhaust, smoke, odor or sound. The visibility at the time of the alleged appearance of the object was approximately forty miles, The sky was clear. The object did not appear to have any propelling fins, stabilizers, slots or duct openings. The object was alleged to have traveled at a speed faster than 1000 miles per hour or as fast, the observers said, the object seemed to blur.

SYNOPSIS
Joseph, this is an initial report.

On 6 April 1949, this office received a memorandum from a reliable government agency concerning the alleged sighting of so-called "Flying Discs".  Informant says of persons reporting, alleged sighting of these objects indicated that they were alleged to have seen a so-called "Flying Disc" in the vicinity of' Dillon, Montana, at approximately 1150 hours, 3 April 1949, the object allegedly appearing at an altitude of approximately three to five thousand feet over the northern part of the City of Dillon, maneuvering about in several directions for several minutes and then rapidly disappearing over and beyond the mountains east of Dillon. The object was alleged to have been observed by four persons, whose accounts of its size, appearance and movements largely corroborated each other. The probability of the observers was regarded by responsible citizens of the community to be beyond a question of doubt.

[REDACTED]

On 3 April 1949, [REDACTED], who owns and operates a construction
company at Dillon, Montana, reported sighting an object commonly known as a
"flying disc" at approximately 1150 hours, 3 April 1949. Mr.[REDACTED] at the time of
the alleged appearance of the object, was standing in the yard of his construction
company located approximately one mile southeast of Dillon, Montana, facing north-
ward at approximately 1150 hours, 3 April 1949, saw what appeared to be a "flying
disc" at an altitude of approximately three to five thousand feet over the northern
part of the city of Dillon Montana, and approximately four miles north of Mr.
[REDACTED]'s position. The object appeared to be approximately twenty feet in diameter and
four to five feet in depth through the center. The object, at the time of sighting
appeared to be rocking in a teeter-totter motion, very much as an inverted saucer
or cup and saucer set might move having in a semi-circular motion. The upper side and
the area viewed of metal and was illuminous and was bright as the upper side of a plate
polished with silver. The lower side appeared to be of the other bluegray or greenish-
gray, which did not reflect light. The shape of the object was that of a plate
or disc placed upon another inverted plate or disc. The edges of the disc were
believed to be exceedingly thin with considerable thickness in the middle.

The object, after rocking from side to side for at least six completed
times, proceeded in an easterly direction and descended rapidly from the height
at which it was first observed down to an altitude of approximately 700 or 1000
feet, at which it again started the rocking motion. After rocking a few times
and reflecting light each time, the upper side came into view. It had then
moved rapidly in a southwesterly direction to a position approximately 1000 feet,
from altitude and two miles west of Dillon, Montana, at which time it again
started the rocking motion. After rocking a few times, it proceeded rapidly
in a position above the airport of Dillon, Montana, at approximately 1000 feet
altitude and twelve miles northeast of Dillon, Montana. The object, again
proceeded in a curve and rapidly disappeared over the mountains SSE of
Dillon, Montana.
