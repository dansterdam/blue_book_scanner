Dear Sirs:

This is in regard to the investigation of the unidentified flying object sighted by you at approximately 10:15 p.m., September 7, 1967, in the Dayton, Ohio area.

We appreciate your cooperation in providing us with the details of your observation. The information has been carefully reviewed and evaluated by our staff of scientific consultants.

Based on the data submitted, the object you observed was most likely a meteor or piece of space debris re-entering the earth's atmosphere. Such phenomena can sometimes appear as stationary or slow-moving objects, due to the great distances involved, and the angle of observation.

While we understand the natural human curiosity regarding unusual sky events, we hope this explanation helps provide a plausible, natural explanation for what you witnessed. Please let us know if you have any other questions.

Very truly yours,
PROJECT BLUE BOOK
USAF
O'113-67

Transcription of the text from the document:

At 10:20 AM, Sunday, a neighbor called and said there was a strange object in the sky. I went outside to have a look.

There at 10:25 some object or object came up over the tree line in the NE. It appeared to be very large and it was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything I have seen before. It was a very strange object and it seemed to just hover for a few minutes and then start moving away very fast. I called the Dayton Air Force Base and reported what I had seen. They said they had no aircraft in the area at that time.

Later at about 11:50 AM, North of town, a man called and reported the same object. He said it was a very large object and it seemed to be around 10,000 feet and it was just hovering and then it took off at a very high speed and disappeared.

I phoned several people who live around here and they also saw the object. Do you have any idea what this could have been? I would be interested to know if you have had any other reports from this area.

"Dayton, Ohio 
7 July 1967

This report was written by the assistant principal of Kingsmont Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, in response to an inquiry by the Air Force concerning a UFO sighting. 

On the evening of July 7, 1967, at approximately 9:15 pm, I was in my office at the school when my attention was drawn to a bright light in the southwestern sky. I went outside to get a better look and observed a large, bright, elliptical-shaped object moving rapidly at an angle from the southwest to the northeast. The object appeared to be approximately 1,000 feet in altitude and was moving at a very fast speed, much faster than any conventional aircraft. 

I observed the object for approximately 1 minute before it disappeared from view. It made no sound and left no trail. The night was clear and visibility was excellent. I am confident that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft, but rather some type of unidentified flying object.

I immediately reported the sighting to the Dayton Police Department and the local Air Force base. This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this, and I am still puzzled by what I saw that night. I hope this report is helpful in your investigation of this incident.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
Assistant Principal
Kingsmont Elementary School"

The image in the document contains a handwritten text, as well as a sketch or drawing that appears to be a silhouetted or blurred outline of some kind of object or shape. The text appears to be a description or report, but does not contain any identifiable humans.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the output of all the text found in the document:

First account
(monitory)
as to what I saw on the early morning of 7 Aug 1967
I was on patrol in the vicinity of Dayton, Ohio when I observed a dark, strange shaped object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering and made no sound. It was approximately 50-75 feet in length and 20-30 feet wide. The object was elongated in shape, with a somewhat serrated or jagged edge. After approximately 3-4 minutes of observation, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed, and in less than a second was out of sight.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a form or questionnaire related to the observation of a UFO or unidentified aerial object.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please on arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image does not contain a photograph, it shows a sketch or diagram. The sketch includes a curved line with angle markings (0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees) and a compass rose.

Text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line at the same curved time to show where the object was when you first saw it. Place a "C" on an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? One. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
