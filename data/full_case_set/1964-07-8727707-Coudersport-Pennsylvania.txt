A. PERSON'S STATEMENT

My wife and I sighted what we believe to be a "UFO" or "flying saucer" on July 7, 1964, at approximately 9:30 PM. The object was observed from our farm located 2 miles east of Coudersport, Pennsylvania, for a period of 10-15 minutes.

The object appeared to be approximately 80-100 feet long and 20-25 feet wide, with pointed ends, and was hovering approximately 200-300 feet above the ground. It had a very bright light on the underside and a series of smaller lights along the sides, which were flashing or pulsating at irregular intervals.

The object made no sound and appeared to have the ability to stop and start, hover, and move in various directions. It finally moved off to the northeast at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

This sighting was also confirmed by several other persons in the area who also observed the object at the same time.
