DETAIL:
1. This investigation requested by the Commanding General, 26th Air Division, USAF. Subject "unidentified object" observed 13 January 1953. The object was sighted at approximately 22:40 at 23:00, The object looked like a star, was red in color, and moved very slowly south.

2. Mrs. c-------, of North Beach Road, Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York, reported that she is a member of the Civil Defense Ground Observer Corps. On 13 January 1953, in the tower of the Observation Beach High School, Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York, she observed an unidentified object of a steady, stationary nature, without any flashing lights. The object was yellow in color, and its size appeared to be about that of a penny held at arms' length. Mrs. c------ stated that she observed the object for about 30 minutes, during which time it moved very slowly, and at one point appeared to stop momentarily. She further stated that the object's movements were in a "waverly" direction, somewhat erratic. She stated that she could not account for this object, except to say that it moved in a very steady and controlled manner, and appeared to be at a very high altitude compared to aircraft operating in the area at that time. Mrs. c------ estimated the object's altitude to be at least 30,000 feet. She stated that the object appeared to be traveling quite rapidly, and in her opinion, in a westerly direction. In her view, the object was not an aircraft, weather balloon, or anything like that, and she could think of no explanation for its presence. This object was observed by several people in the Community and area, and one man stated that he, too, could make no identification of the object.

3. Mrs. c------'s daughter and a visiting friend also observed the object, and stated that their impressions coincided with Mrs. c------'s. They stated that the object was definitely not an airplane or anything they had ever seen before.

4. Captain DONALD M. COHEN, AD 931 495, USAF, 12-9 Squadron, Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, was assigned to the Observation Beach High School tower on 13 January 1953. Captain COHEN stated that the observation was made between 2215 and 2320 hours, and that the object was visible for approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes. COHEN stated that the object appeared to be a bright light, yellowish in color, and that its size appeared to be about 1/100 the size of the full moon. COHEN stated that the object remained stationary, except for a slight drift or movement, and that no sound was heard. COHEN stated that the object disappeared at approximately 2320 hours.
