Dear Col. Friend:

I feel that it is first necessary to inform you on one of the group members of the new project we are starting on February 25, 1962. A report was made to the Honnerton Base which in turn was forwarded on to you. Through XXXXX, one of our group, we learned the report had been sent to him. When told by XXXXX that it had observed the object and also report the second observation to you.

I am very sorry that I am so late in sending this report have been working on a defense pair project on a scientific basis and started a project on my father's farm during the 1961 meeting at a saucer club at the South Florida Science Fair. I wish my report, for I photographed the object on three occasions while working on my project. I am sending you the report only as you requested.

The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with typed text describing an observation made on March 6, 1962.

The text reads:

"You are well informed of the first observation. I will give you the paper print in outline form.

1. Second Observation
   a. Date: March 6, 1962
   b. Time: 9:15 PM
   c. Duration: 45 minutes, 2 photographs 
   d. Ground covered: east of my location
   e. Speed: Extremely fast, of very short duration
   f. Direction heading: Easterly 
   g. Direction traveling: West
   h. Approximate altitude: 18,000 - 20,000 ft.

On March 6, 1962 I was observing in search of Comet 3e. Just a dark haze in the south kindled my observation. It took a minute scanning of the Parasuis Area. At 9:15 PM I observed through binoculars the Parasuis Area. At 9:20 PM I observed in direction of the 22:55 appearance I sighted in distorted formation of magnitude 1-2 appeared as strong skies in Ursa Major. They were traveling almost due eastward. They covered the sky in estuary and were now descending. They continued across the sky, going SE - it passed the western horizon and disappeared in the north northwest. 

I trained my TASCO binoculars on them, finding them difficult to interpret. Extremely small, difficult to interpret them properly."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing one. The text states that the photograph shows a 3.0 magnitude object (the reported UFO) which was visible on the image through 7X50 binoculars, but the object was not visually observed because the binoculars were not in use. The observer is sending a report about this observation to Northwestern University.

The text from the document is as follows:

"Sighted in the 7X50 binoculars.
The photograph shows three 3.0 magnitude objects (the objects formed) on the photograph, but the fifth object was visible on the photograph only. The object was not visually observed because the binoculars were not in use. 
I am enclosing the photograph and also sending a report. Yours at Northwestern University.
Respectfully,
Hialeah, Florida"

Dear Bob:

I want to confirm the case of January 29, 1962
and that act that it called one of the best-authenticated
cases of its kind in recent years. The sighting was observed
to last for some 30 minutes and he finally now has gotten
credit to it, but it should have also credit for the fact
that it leaves a photograph which looks for all the world
to be an authentic saucer. However, this photo is said to
be out of focus and therefore it is not conclusive proof, though
a strong presumption. It was recorded by two independent
observers at the time and no noise. Further, it
cannot simply be dismissed as say, 15 to 20 seconds observation
which could easily be mistaken. This was March 6, 1952.

In view of the reliability of the observers and the
photographic if legis and the excellent reporting.
think this case stands out. This case calls for commendation. 
meeting. Let me know when you plan to be here.

Cordially,

J. Allen Hynek

Dear Professor Hynek,

I feel that it is first necessary to identify myself as an amateur astronomer who saw the object, or objects over the South Florida coast on January 25, 1962. This is the second time on March 6, 1962.

I am very sorry that I am so late in sending this report. I have been working on a Science Fair project on Astronomy, and have been so involved with this project that it has delayed this report.

I wish to comment on this report, for I photographed the objects on the occasion with my telescope on my Science Fair project.

I will proceed with the report first in outline form:

1. First Observation
A. Date: January 25, 1962
B. Time: 6:45 PM EST
C. Magnitude: 2 Approx.
D. Color: Red-orange
E. Duration: Appeared for a total of 6-15 seconds
F. Movement: 4 
G. Direction first seen: South

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

B. Director last seen: North
H. Direction traveling: North
I. Approximate altitude: 15,000 - 20,000 ft.

Second Observation
A. Date: March 6, 1962
B. Time: 8:35 P.M. EST
C. Conditions: 1.5 magnitude (sic) 1.9 photographic
D. Color: Red-orange
E. Speed: Covered most of sky in 17 seconds.
F. Direction: Traveled irregularly, 5 photographs.
G. Direction first seen: Northeast
H. Direction last seen: Northwest
I. Approximate altitude: Low, 15,000 - 20,000 ft.

First Observation
The sky was hazy in the south and quite bright in the north after daylight by contrast. The object (__redacted__) and myself) but a 3-4-inch reflecting telescope, 80X zoom binoculars, extreme near sightedness, poor focusing, and weather did not permit more definitive observation. At 8:25 PM one of the boys (either __redacted__ or __redacted__) exclaimed, "There's a meteor!" On first observation it appeared stationary, but on closer inspection it had the appearance of a fuzzy star about 1.5" in diameter. It decreased in intensity - it appeared to be traveling toward the southeast. They appeared to approximately (sic) 12-15 seconds color. As the object passed, the same witnesses observed the appearance of a smaller satellite or satellite-like object following the main object. They appeared to approximately the same color.

Transcribed text:

"Having the 4-inch atrograph opened in the immediate area to photograph them. As they disappeared in the bright, overcast conditions, the shutter stayed open for approximately 15 - 20 seconds.

Second Observation:
On March 5, 1962 I was observing in search of Comet Seki, but a deep haze in the south hindered my observation. I noticed a bright object in the south-west, low on the horizon. At 8:35 p.m. when I opened the shutter of the f/2.5 35mm camera for a timed exposure of 35 seconds, I observed in the center of the field a luminosity (apparent diameter 3-4 minutes of arc) that appeared to be a solid object in motion. This motion was uniform and not due rotation. They were red-orange in color and seemed to be of low altitude. After 10 seconds they crossed the sky, disappearing to the north-west in the haze. The observation lasted 17 seconds.

I trained my 7X50mm binoculars on them, finding them strikingly star-like nucleusus. Extremely small discs could barely be distinguished in the 7X50 binoculars.

The photograph shows three 1-6 magnitude objects (the field objects forming overlapping trails on the film.) After a fifth object was visible, the photograph shows only the blurred images of that which was.

I am enclosing the photograph of my second observation.

Respectfully,"
