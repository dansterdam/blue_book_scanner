Dear Miss-

This is in reply to your letter concerning aerial observations which you have made.

At the time of the sighting, an investigation would have been under the Jurisdiction of the Air Force. It is not feasible to attempt an investigation at this time, over 10 years later.

I am enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book. I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

John S. McClymont

To Whom It May Concern:

My name is [redacted]. I'm 15 years old and live at [redacted], Chatham, New Jersey.

Last summer, 1964, I saw a sight in the sky. It wasn't flying saucers and the U.S. Air Force, Lawrence J. Tacker, told me that I didn't imagine it.  

It was about 9:30 and I were outside talking. I notice something in the sky and I were talking real fast. I was talking and I were told to hush.

I saw that it weren't no plane or satellite and I were talking about it and have been trained to look up when I notice things like that.

Out of nowhere in the northern sky an object this shape appeared and silently moved to the rear and went behind some trees. It was like a blue light, but no trail, just a flash of light in the western sky. It moved very fast. Before anyone could return to see it had disappeared. Not more than 10 seconds. Nothing happened after that. I would have written you that night, but my friend said I was playing a trick on him. That I was wrong and there.
