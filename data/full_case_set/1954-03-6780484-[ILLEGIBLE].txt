I have been with this file for over four years.

2. On [REDACTED] I was personally on the scene in the evening. I wish to relate what I observed, and I wish to comment upon the meaning of some of the other data in this file.

They appear to have been made for a purpose which I surmised to be an attempt to mislead or confuse those who might eventually examine this file. It is my personal opinion, based on four years' experience, that there is a great deal of data in this file which can be considered valid information concerning unidentified flying objects. I believe this file contains important information which should be made available to qualified technical personnel for detailed study and analysis.

straight line path and was in sight for about a minute. The observers
thi  was some sort of observation satellite, but they were not controlled b
operation.

speed and described as saucer-shaped and much larger than either of the previously 
described objects. It was observed to be saucer-shaped in appearance and of such a size that it blocked out abo
third of the diameter of the moon when directly in front of it. The object appeared 
to be traveling at a high rate of speed and was observed for only a few seconds. No other details are known.

Statement of . . .
Date: Ol Anted Air Force Base, Middletown, Penna.

On 9 March 1954, while on duty in the Operations Building at Olmsted Air Force Base, Middletown, Penna., the operator on duty in the control tower reported to him that he had observed a target which appeared to be a flying object. The operator stated that he had tracked the target on the radat scope for approximately 15 minutes. 
The target was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 700 miles per hour. The target would disappear from the radar scope and then reappear. While the target was visible, it was observed to make an abrupt 90 degree turn.

At 2330 hours the target disappeared from the radar scope and was not picked up again. An entry of this sighting was entered in the air traffic control log.

If we consider the authenticity of this report, we must take into account the military background and training of the observer, the technical capabilities of the radar equipment involved, and the nature of the reported object's maneuvers, all of which appear to be beyond the performance characteristics of any known aircraft. However, this report must be considered in conjunction with other similar reports, if any, in order to determine whether or not it represents reliable evidence of an unidentified flying object.

I am convinced that the source of the lights was up the river toward south. The lights seemed to be hovering in the air for sometime. They would appear to move rapidly for a short distance and then stop and hover again. The lights looked to be about the size of a man's fist held at arm's length. There were about 4 or 5 of them. They were a whitish-blue color. The lights were up the river beyond the trees and below the horizon. They were not on the ground but up in the air. The lights were not aircraft and did not have any sound. The lights moved in a horizontal motion up the river and did not ascend or descend vertically.

UNCLASSIFIED
6 March 1954

Statement of A. D. D. , Harrisburg, Penna.

1. Captain D. reported that he and Harris inspected (combined facility) to watch a curious light wander across the sky, suspected to be an I.C.B.M. This operation is reported under the Civil Aeronautics Administration Facilities, No. 50.

2. On 2 March 1954, at approximately ten minutes after ten P.M. I received a call on the inter-phone from the Middletown Air Traffic Control Center. They reported to me that strange lights were visible in the sky from the tower and wished me to go out and take a look. I went out to the tower and looked for the strange lights, but was unable to see anything unusual. I told them this over the inter-phone.

3. Upon hanging up the inter-phone I looked out the tower window and directly to the south, over the distant hills, I observed the following: A single light, half (1/2) the size of the moon, bright yellowish-white in color, appeared to be hovering and pulsating. This light was at an estimated altitude of about 3,000 feet and about 3/4 mile distant from the tower.

4. I watched this light for several minutes. They were of the opinion that it was a meteorological balloon. They were very close to the object and were able to make a careful observation. At times they appeared to be an elongated shape, at other observations they seemed to be circular in outline.

5. I requested an explanation of this incident. I was advised that the lights had the outline of a dirigible or blimp, but they had no markings or running lights to indicate a normal aircraft. This was an unidentified aerial object, about 200 feet in length.

6. The weather on this occasion was clear and they had an excellent view from the tower. They advised that they had no knowledge of any Navy blimp or other lighter-than-air craft in this area. While there is a Navy Blimp Control Tower at Harrisburg, they advised there were no lighter-than-air craft of any kind in this area.

After these lights were out of view, our Towers Middletown Control Tower advised that they had lost these lights. They appeared to have landed or departed.

March 1954

Statement of R. E. Harrison to the Director, Per R. M. Harris

1. I am a Civil Service employee at Cleveland Air Force Base, Middle-town, Ohio, and work as an Electronic Altert Ground Control Interceptor Station. I have been on this job for three years.

2. On 25 March 1954, at approximately 10:30 p.m., I observed a bright light in the sky. I watched this object for approximately 30 minutes. It appeared to be oval shaped and about the size of a quarter-at arm's length. It was bluish-white in color and emitted a pulsing glow. I watched as the object made a rapid ascent and then a rapid descent. I saw three lights on the object - two on the outer edges and one in the center. These lights rotated around the object. Then I saw three pulsating reddish lights that appeared to be coming from the center of the object. After a few minutes, the object disappeared from sight.

3. I looked into the sky in the direction in which we observed this object. They were bright lights up in the sky. They seemed to be maneuverable and were not aircraft. They were emitting a glow and moving against the wind. They were in the sky for a few minutes and then disappeared.

4. There appears to be moving slowly all the time to appear at varying distances and then disappear.

5. While I was in the air, I saw a light to the rear and while the co-pilot also saw this light I was unable to make a positive identification of this object. However, as I watched, this light split into three separate white lights and then disappeared.

6. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Statement of ---
Progress, Vermont

1. I am a service employee at ---ed Air Force Base and work in the flight "maintenance" section. I have served in this capacity for some time.

2. On the morning of 4 March 1954, at about 10 o'clock (a.m.), I went out on the line to take a look at some work that was being done on one of the planes. As I approached the area, I noticed that the runway lights were on, and they seemed very bright. I looked up and saw a strange light hovering over the area. It was a large, oval-shaped object, and it appeared to be about 200 feet in diameter. It was completely silent and seemed to be about 500 feet in the air. I watched it for several minutes, and it made no sound and showed no signs of propulsion. It just hovered there, motionless.

3. I called the fellow who was with me, that is, --- who also saw the object. We both watched it for some time, and we were both amazed by what we saw. The object then started to move slowly, and it gained altitude as it moved. It moved in a straight line and disappeared from sight. I have no idea what this object was, but I can assure you that it was not an aircraft or anything I have ever seen before.

4. To the best of my knowledge and belief, this statement is true.

6 March 1954

I am a Civilian employee of [REDACTED] Air Force Base and want to report an incident which occurred on [REDACTED] when I was on duty at the radar station. I have been instructed not to discuss this incident with anyone other than my immediate superiors.

At approximately 8:00 p.m. on [REDACTED] I was on duty at the radar station. I noticed an object on the radar screen which was traveling at a tremendous speed and made an extremely sharp turn which is not possible for any of our aircraft. The object appeared to be oval in shape and was emitting a bright glow. It passed over the airbase and disappeared from the radar screen within a matter of seconds. I am at a loss to explain what this object could have been.

This incident has been officially reported to the Intelligence Officer and Project Blue Book. They informed me that this was not an isolated incident and that they are investigating similar reports from other radar stations. However, they cautioned me not to discuss this matter with anyone else.

This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

On 3 March 1954, at about 2110 hours, a light was observed in a field near [ILLEGIBLE], which appeared to be hovering and maneuvering at a low altitude. The object was seen for approximately 90 minutes and was observed to ascend vertically at a high rate of speed and disappear.

The witness was first a farmer who was working in the field and observed the light and a [ILLEGIBLE] who was called to the scene who also observed the light. Both witnesses, independently, stated the object appeared to be approximately 35-40 feet in diameter and gave off a bright bluish-white light. The object was watched as it hovered approximately 10 feet above the ground, then ascended vertically at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

CONCLUSIONS: The observer, who has held any position in the air control or intelligence fields, stated he was unable to identify the object and that no aircraft were known to be in the area at the time. An analysis of the information indicates that the object was unidentified and that no logical explanation could be deduced. All the evidence indicates that the object was a bona fide [ILLEGIBLE] which could not be identified as any known type of aircraft or vehicle.

For complete details:

1. At 2120 (EST), radar operators at GATP picked up an unknown target
at an altitude of approximately 51,000 feet. The object was tracked at an average speed of 500 knots for a distance of approximately 20 miles. The object traveled from 215 degrees to 150 degrees in azimuth. The object was tracked on two different radar scopes, confirmed by visual sighting from the control tower. The motion of the object was smooth and continuous, without any abrupt changes in course or speed. 

2. At 2135, the senior alert operator on the flight line, CATP, observed a bright light moving across the sky at a high rate of speed. The light was observed for approximately 30 seconds and then disappeared from sight. CATP states that the light was of an unusual shape and did not blink or change in intensity like normal aircraft lights.

No further details.
