REPORT NO. MTJT-78-95-13

NOTES: The following signed statement was submitted to this headquarters by the undersigned in his own words:

At approximately 1905 hours, 9 July 1953, I, A/2C J.D. SHEPPARD, was admitted to the USAF hospital, 3720th Medical Group, Sheppard AFB, Texas, with injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. During treatment, I made the following statement:

"I was riding alone in my 1952 Ford, enroute to Sheppard AFB on Route 82, approximately 12 miles west of Wichita Falls, Texas, when I observed an extremely bright light in the sky. It appeared to be round or oval in shape, and at first I thought it was an aircraft. As I got closer, I saw that it was suspended in the air and seemed to glow with a pulsating, bluish-white light. The object appeared to be about 10-15 feet in diameter. It remained stationary in the sky for approximately 3 minutes.

"As I approached the object, it suddenly shot straight up into the air at a high rate of speed and disappeared. I was so amazed and frightened by what I had seen that I completely lost control of my car, ran off the road, and struck a highway sign. I sustained moderate injuries in the accident.

"The object was at such a low altitude, and so close to my vehicle, that I could make out some details. It appeared to be completely silent, and gave off no exhaust or vapor trails. I have never seen anything like this before, and can offer no explanation as to what it might have been."

The object at its highest point appeared to be about (8) inches in diameter as viewed from my position.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: 375oth Photo Recon Wg 
TO: HQ, USAF

NOTES: The following is a statement of observations from A/2C Sheppard, 375th Radio Sq, upon returning from leave:

"At approx 1205 hours, 9 July 1953, I was returning from a short weekend pass to the 375th Radio Squadron Operations Section, Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. As the bus approached the hospital gate, I observed an object in the sky to my right and pointed it out to the other bus passengers. It was a round, silvery object, unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. It appeared to be traveling very fast, estimated at 800 to 1000 miles per hour, and was losing altitude rapidly. The object disappeared from view in about 10 seconds. It appeared to be circular in shape, between 50 and 100 feet in diameter, and was absolutely silent. There was no trail or exhaust visible. The object did not seem to be affected by the wind, as it maintained a straight course. I am convinced that the object was some type of flying machine, but I have never seen one like it before. I would say it remains in my mind as an unidentified flying object."
