The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, likely an investigation report or analysis. The text on the page discusses an "apparent oscillation" that was observed and how the time discrepancy could have actually existed.

Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED ROUTINE

This change could possibly explain the apparent oscillation, as it moves in the northerly direction. The reported object may have been a satellite, and if so, the time discrepancy could have actually existed.

THE INDEPENDENT ACTIVITY NORTH OF AUSTIN COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OBJECTS(S) AT APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREES ELEVATION. VIEWING THE OBJECTS THROUGH HIGH CIRRUS CLOUDS COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE DISCREPANCY OF THE INDEPENDENT ACTIVITY.
