SUBJECT: Request for Analysis
TO: AFOIN-4EL FROM: AFOIN-4E1
DATE: 17 DEC 57
COMMENT NR 2
1. The speed of the targets (60-70 mph), the way in which they faded out at 15-20 M. P. and the differences in part. It that migratory ducks have been observed on this radar, tend to discredit the conclusion in this case.
2. According to the INF sighting, WADC INF project engineer (who was contacted about this) indicates that the radar display of this incident is similar to the normal characteristics of flights (migratory birds) that we have been detecting here on CIVIL AIR PATROL missions. In particular, the fast speed of about 200 mph seems to bear out this supposition. INF equipment is not geared to handle very high speeds and the small return from the targets could be explained as birds rather than flights as CIVIL AIR PATROL has observed.
