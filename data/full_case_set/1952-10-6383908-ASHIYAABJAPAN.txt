The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report. It contains a "PROJECT 1073 RECORD CARD" with details about an unidentified object sighting that occurred on 15 Oct 52 at Ashiya AB, Japan. The sighting was observed by a radar operator, and the target was described as similar to light with a painted radar scope at the Ashiya Air Base. The sighting lasted for three hours, and no visual contact was made. The document concludes that the sighting was "Probably propagation, possibly interference" in the comments section.

The text of the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PREPARED BY: 1St LT. C. K. WILLIAMS, 3602nd AISS
DATE INFORMATION OBTAINED: 25 October 1952
EVALUATION: A-2

REFERENCE: (Related number, direction, brevity report, etc., as appropriate)
1. On 15 October 1952 and again on 16 October 1952, unidentified objects described as luminous, stationary, oval-shaped objects were observed in the sky near Ashiya, Japan, by the personnel of this unit. The objects were first observed at about 6:30 p.m., 15 October 1952 and again at about 6:00 p.m., 16 October 1952. The objects appeared in the north, moving to the south as far as 20 to 30 miles and then returning to the north. The objects were observed for a period of 15 to 20 minutes on both occasions. The objects were estimated to be approximately 5 to 10 miles in altitude and about the size of a small aircraft. They appeared to be luminous, giving off a bluish-white light that changed to a reddish-orange as they moved. They did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion and made no sound.
2. The (3) of the Four (4) witnesses agreed that the unidentified objects:
a. Appeared to be circular or oval in shape.
b. Estimated the size of the objects to be about that of a B-29 bomber.
c. Appeared to be a bluish-white, changing to a reddish-orange color.
d. Remained stationary for about 10 to 15 minutes and then moved to the south for a distance of 20 to 30 miles, returning to the north in about the same time.
e. Made no sound and gave off no exhaust or trail.
f. Remained visible for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes on each occasion.

Following statement furnished as required by AFI 200-5, dtd 20 Apr 52

STATEMENT

Par 7. c. (1): Objects presented target similar to aluminum objects sounded on radar according to pilots of F-86 aircraft. Speed of objects estimated 50 to 70 MPH. Objects had no definite track although general movement was to south. No sound was heard. Objects appeared between 200 and 500 feet above surface usually disappearing in ground clutter on radar screens.

Par 7. c. (2): Time of sighting between 2300 hours October 15, 1952 and 0300 hours 16 October 1952.

Par 7. c. (3): Objects observed with radar set AN/MPN-1 (CCA) unit #20, on both 2 and 10 mile precision (azimuth and elevation) scopes and the search display on scope. 

Par 7. c. (4): CCA unit located at Ashiya AB Base, 33° 53' N 130° 40' E. Objects usually appeared north to west, 5 to 10 statute miles from 2 miles of field tracking inbound to station and disappearing in ground clutter around the field with definite tracking ranges from 200 to 500 feet.

Par 7. c. (5): Nothing could be seen visually. The undersigned has had 5 years experience in AN/MPN-1 type radar scope presentation.

Par 7. c. (6): Weather at time of observation: Sky condition - four thousand feet scattered; visibility 10 miles; altimeter setting 29.99; winds aloft and surface: Cirrostratus 15 knots from 270°, Altostratus 10 knots from 270°, Cumulus 15 knots from 270°, Cirrocumulus thousand five hundred feet - 10 knots from 270°. No other altitude readings available.

Par 7. c. (7): No logical explanation except some type of large bird.

Par 7. c. (8): No physical evidence such as fragments or photographs.

Par 7. c. (9): Pilots of aircraft in vicinity reported seeing nothing.

Par 7. c. (10): Take offs and landings at air base were frequent.

Following statement furnished as required 18 Apr 200-5, dtd 20 Apr 52

STATEMENT

1. Objects on present runway illuminated with intensity similar to sight aircraft but the density of the reflection indicated the objects were higher than 200-5' AGL from the end of the runway and entering ground clutter on the south side of the runwry. The objects showed themselves to be from 200 to 500 feet wide and crossed the scope at a maximum velocity of over 70 MPH. Objects calculated to speed estimated from 50 to 70 MPH.

2. The undersigned has had 37 years experience in CGA.

3. Believe objects to be ducks.

The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an incident related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) observed in the evening of October 18, 1952 in Ashiya, Japan.

Following statement furnished as required by AFR 200-2, dtd 20 Apr 52

STATEMENT 

On the evening of the 18th of October 1952, I T/Sgt Raymond E. Chase, was on duty in the CCA trailer located at Ashiya AB Base, Japan. 

I observed moving with the other targets. These targets appeared to be identical with slow moving aircraft. These targets had no definite course or formation, but moved from north to south. At one time five targets appeared. 

The lower informed us they could not see anything in that area.

These targets also were on the elevation scope appearing between 200 and 500 feet in the air.

I have been in CCA 21 months. Do not know what these targets were and do not wish to guess.

There is no photograph or image present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. This appears to be a textual document containing a statement about observations of strange objects on precision radar scopes.

Following statement furnished as per 20 Apr 52 

STATEMENT

1. Observed strange objects on precision radar scopes (AI/ERT-11) at altitudes ranging from five to ten thousand feet. The targets gave a presentation similar to that of conventional aircraft and were traveling at speeds of fifteen to twenty miles per hour. The objects maintained stable and constant courses and were observed for a period of ten to fifteen minutes as they flew across the end of the runway and entering the ground clutter on the south side of the runway.

2. The undersigned has had ten months experience observing precision GCA type radar scopes.

3. Believe objects to be birds.
