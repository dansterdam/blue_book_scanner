There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book report. 

Here is the text output from the document:

On Sunday, March 28, 2:25 p.m., an unidentified object was seen over parts of Eastern Connecticut. The object was described as spherical in shape, and was observed by hundreds of people through the area at the same time. Telephone calls requesting information on the sighting were received by police departments and radio stations.  

The March 29th issue of the Norwich Bulletin had a short account of the sighting, listing the object as resembling a balloon or sphere. The article also said there were other sightings in the area on that date, but no effort was made to actually identify the object.

The following is a resume of several witness reports as given to the author of this article:

Time of Sighting: 2:50 - 3:05 p.m. approximately.
Description: The object was spherical in shape and silver in color. It was observed to be stationary for periods of time and then to move slowly, emitting no sound. The object also appeared to rotate about a vertical axis at times. 
Observations: Round in shape, appeared to have depth, and seemed to be illuminated from within. They say the object appeared to be about 200 yards in diameter, and remained in sight for an estimated 15 minutes.
Movement: The object was in general easterly direction. This did not coincide with wind direction, as observers said the wind was from the north. The object moved slowly at first, then appeared to speed up somewhat. All but one or two observers claimed the movement was in a vertical or circular movement, but movement was in general easterly direction.

Observers felt that the object was too bright to be a balloon - and they felt that the object seemed to be intelligently controlled, as the motion was erratic and purposeful. All observers agreed that the object appeared to be far above normal airplane height. Observers tried to determine altitude by comparing the object to known landmarks, and estimated its height at between 10,000 - 12,000 feet. The object appeared to be approximately 2 feet in diameter when viewed against the sky.

Spectators reported that when the object disappeared, it seemed to blend into the sky - appearing to recede rapidly rather than to vanish. The object was sighted by many observers in the Norwich, Connecticut area at the same time.

SOME OBSERVERS SAW WHAT RESEMBLED 'JET BLAST' COMING FROM THE OBJECT
COMMENTS: 'The observers, 4 in number, observed an object which they described as a 'blast or discharge or exhaust from the object, resembling a jet blast.' This object was not a balloon, and the object was seen at the same time.

The last witness to contact me was one of a group of men in communications connections who witnessed the sighting. AMONG THESE MEN WERE SOME WHO WERE PILOTS, FORMER PILOTS AND ENGINEERS of some kind. This group was sure the object was not a balloon.
IT CONCLUSION FROM ABOVE FACTS NOTED IS THAT OBJECT WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT A BALLOON. THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A MISSILE.

I do not see any photographs or images present in the provided document. The document appears to be a typed text, likely an excerpt from a UFO report or investigation.

Transcribing the text in the document:

I had just completed the other long report enclosed when another sighting occurrence was brought to my attention.

It had been called to the attention of officials at the Air Force Station here on March 26th. This of course, had with it my name.

On Thursday, April 1, I received a phone call at 7:30 p.m. from an official of the Station in charge of the Sunday sighting. She replied in the affirmative, she was the one who had witnessed the phenomenon and whose sister-in-law had supposedly witnessed the same thing. I spoke only briefly, as her father-in-law had suddenly passed away.

The story she told me was rather disjointed, but from what I could gather, her husband had been outside their home when he was suddenly covered by a strange light. It appeared to him 3 or 4 Shadows on the ground close to his feet. 

I asked the woman the direction in which the object was moving, and I learned it was heading in a northerly direction. It seemed the object was luminous and about 20-30 feet in diameter, and no sound was associated with it. I estimated its speed through the air to be fairly rapid.

This is about to call it again. This time it was going to be a call of Verification to communications at the nearby U.S. Navy station which I know well, and whose veracity I would never question.

With this new information, I started to analyze the report again carefully,looking into the story as to its authenticity. I told the officer at the Station over the phone that from what she had told me, the object did not seem hostile at all. 

At 7:15 this evening, I was walking to my home when suddenly I was bathed in light. At first, I thought it was the moon, but soon realized it was an extremely bright light. It grew larger and brighter, and was moving at a tremendous speed. In a second or two it had passed over me, and as rapidly as it had appeared, it disappeared.

I questioned in my own mind about the object's being a jet aircraft though of course objects at high altitude move very rapidly. But jets are not this bright, nor do they stop and return in the same direction. This object made no sound at all as it passed.

The summary of all this is that it was not an aircraft of any kind, because of sound. The light was very bright and apparently the object was self-luminous, exhibiting no visible exhaust of any kind. Because of sound, it could not have been an aircraft of any kind.

Text in the document:

Most interesting of all, I believe was the fact of objective being seen in the place, together with changing, some might say, maneuvering, some being quite sharply different, just about the same time. This is a real indication of the thing's speed.

Respectfully submitted,
For A.P.R.O.
