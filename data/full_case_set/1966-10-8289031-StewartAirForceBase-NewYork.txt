CO1301. Sirius was on an azimuth of 137 degrees and at an elevation of approximately 17 degrees.

Observers watched a round multi-colored object in the sky. The object had alternately flashing red, green, and white. The alleged UFO appeared to be moving slowly back and forth over the base pond. The object did not disappear while it was under observation.

On a later evening the investigating officer had one of the witnesses identify the same body as in his original sighting, it being the star Sirius.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically from a document dated 1966-10-8289031 related to a sighting at Stewart Air Force Base in New York.

The text in the document is as follows:

J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting: N/A

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
Captain Stephen Levine, USAF, Rated Pilot/Navigator
(1) I have concluded positively that the above mentioned airmen had the star "Sirius" under observation.
(a) Sirius emits the colors seen.
(b) I had ASC coordinates identify the same body as in his original sighting on a later evening; it was the star Sirius.
(c) I positively identified this star in relation to its position to the constellation "Belt of Orion" better known as the navigators triangle.
(d) Another report which is also being filed was made on the same night from Spring Valley, NY. The findings are the same.
(e) Apparent movement of Sirius was caused by staring at it without using anything else as a reference.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: None.
