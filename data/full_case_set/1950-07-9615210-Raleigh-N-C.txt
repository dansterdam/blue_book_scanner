Saucers Sighted
Raleigh, N. C., Monday Morning, July 3, 1950.

Four people, local residents, reported yesterday morning they had seen several "saucer-like" objects in a northwesterly direction. They were described as silvery and metallic in appearance, but did not appear to be moving with windows. As the objects moved, they tilted and flashed as though rotating. The witnesses could not estimate their altitude, no could they give an idea of their size. The formation of three or four objects was accompanied by a peculiar humming sound.

The objects were observed for several minutes from a big home on Poole Boyce Avenue where the witnesses were standing.

The image contains a textual description of a sighting of a circular object flying at 5,000 M.P.H. over Los Angeles, California on July 6, 1950. The object was observed by William Grant, a former Marine Corps aerial photographer, who reported that the object was about 50 feet in circumference and was traveling at a speed of about 100 miles per hour, increasing to about 500 miles an hour before disappearing behind the Hollywood hills. The text also mentions that the object "left no exhaust trail" and was observed by Gilbert Mazzil, the president of a concern investigating research with helicopters.
