Dear Sir:
On June 6, 1966, at approximately 1930 hours, I observed a strange object in the sky over Waikiki Beach, Hawaii. The object appeared to be metallic in color and roughly circular in shape. It was traveling in a northerly direction at high speed and made an abrupt change in direction, accelerating rapidly. I was able to obtain several photographs of the object before it disappeared from view.
Enclosed are the photographs for your examination. I would appreciate your analysis of this sighting and any information you can provide.
Sincerely,
John Doe
