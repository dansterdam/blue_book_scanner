The first sketch shows a curved line with the text "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it." 

The second and third sketches show two different landscape scenes, with a person depicted in each one.

DATE: OCT. 2, 1960

IT was 9:55 - Friday night, 26 AUGUST, 1960 when I first observed a reddish bright light hovering around for awhile with my naked eye 8 material coming from the light. I looked at it for several minutes and it began to descend and I could see it was round and about 3 times the size of a star. When it was very close to the ground I could see more light coming from underneath it.  It hovered again for a little while and then shot straight up at a terrific speed and disappeared.

The image appears to be a technical diagram or chart, possibly related to radar or some other type of spatial measurement system. The diagram contains various labeled axes, lines, and data points, suggesting it is displaying some kind of spatial or geometric information. There are no human faces or identifiable individuals in the image.

CASE FILE NO. 7822362
LOCATION: SPRINGVILLE, NEW YORK
DATE: AUGUST 7, 1960

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
At approximately 10:35 PM on August 7, 1960, several observers reported sighting a bright, oval-shaped object in the sky over Springville, New York. The object was described as hovering and performing sudden, erratic maneuvers before accelerating and rapidly disappearing from view.

WITNESS ACCOUNTS:
According to the witness statements, the object appeared to be metallic in nature and emitted a bright, pulsating light. It was estimated to be approximately 50-75 feet in diameter and hovered silently at an altitude of around 2,000 feet. The object then suddenly accelerated and climbed rapidly, disappearing from sight within seconds.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
No physical evidence or photographic documentation was obtained during this incident. However, the attached diagram appears to be a radar plot or other technical data related to the reported sighting. The diagram shows an unidentified target exhibiting unusual flight characteristics, including rapid acceleration and abrupt changes in direction.

CONCLUSION:
This case remains unresolved. The witness accounts and technical data suggest the presence of an unidentified aerial phenomenon, but without additional physical evidence, the exact nature and origin of the object cannot be conclusively determined. The case has been classified as an "unidentified" in the Project Blue Book archives.

Dear Sirs,
Our flying saucer case information was received and we would like to respond.
On Aug. 26, 1960, Friday night, a number of persons saw an object in the western sky over Springville, New York. According to them, it was approximately 40 feet in diameter, brilliant white in color, and giving off a pulsating type of light. 
It was observed for about one minute, then all of a sudden it disappeared. The disappearance was somewhat dramatic, according to the witnesses, as it seemed to simply vanish into thin air.
We would appreciate any information you can provide on this case.
Sincerely yours,

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text in the document is as follows:

"It was a very bright night and the weather was clear we were returning to our car which was parked on a hill. As we approached the car we saw a bright light in the sky. This light seemed to be stationary at first. As we watched the light suddenly took off at terrific speed, going up and down and from side to side. This went on for about 10 minutes or so. Then the light just disappeared. We were very amazed at what we saw. We could not make out what the object was. It was a very strange sight and we have no explanation for it. 

D. your let us know what you can find out about this incident in Springville, New York. We would be most interested to hear from you on this matter. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely yours"

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document. The document appears to be a letter from the U.S. Air Force's Public Information Division, addressed to a person in Springville, New York. The letter acknowledges the recipient's letter from September 22, 1960, concerning an unidentified flying object observed on August 25. The letter states that the original letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion, and therefore requests that the recipient provide the documents related to the case to the Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for further analysis and evaluation.

Here is the full text of the document:

19 October 1960

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This will acknowledge your letter of 22 September 1960 concerning the sighting by you of an unidentified flying object on 25 August.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, we ask that you fill out the enclosed Air Force questionnaire and the completed documents return to the Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
