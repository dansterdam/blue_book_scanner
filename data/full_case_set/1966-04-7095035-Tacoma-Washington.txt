The text describes the object as being rounded, silver in color, and traveling east to northeast at an estimated 5,000 feet. It appeared twice during the 20-minute observation period, traveling in a circular course. The observer suggested it could have been satellites, but the sighting is consistent with an aircraft. The text notes that it is possible that one aircraft could have circled the area, but it is also possible that more than one aircraft were observed.
