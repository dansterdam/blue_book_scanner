FOUR PLANETS NOW VISIBLE
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will be visible to the naked eye in June. In addition, nine bright stars, ranging from Aquarius to Vega, will be visible during the month.

BY JAMES STOKLEY

It comes as the joy planets over visible to the naked eye can be seen in June evenings, mid those bright stars will appear in the southern sky.

Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will all be visible during the month. Venus will be the brightest object in the western sky after sunset, and can be seen for several hours each evening.

Mars, which showed up in the east about midnight in May, is now well up in the south early in the evening and will be a conspicuous object all night long. It appears much brighter than Jupiter and Saturn, which also grace the southern sky.

Jupiter and Saturn, on the other hand, are visible in the south and southwest during the evening. Jupiter is fading in brilliance, but Saturn is still fairly bright. To the west, in Aquarius, several bright stars dot the sky, including Altair, Vega and Denebola. In the northeast, the brilliant star Arcturus is visible.

VENUS AND MARS IN WEST

Venus remains the brightest star-like object in the western sky, rivaling or even exceeding the brilliance of the largest planet, Jupiter, at this time. For the month of June, Venus will be in the west, gradually sinking lower in the sky.

Mars, on the other hand, is shifting to the northwest in the evening. It has been a brilliant object, outshining even Jupiter in recent months. But now the planet is waning in brilliance.

The position of Mars is indicated on the accompanying map.  It is now much farther to the west, still quite high in the evening sky, but sinking lower as the nights go on.

JUPITER AND SATURN IN SOUTH

The two other bright planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are now in the southern sky in the evening. Jupiter is the brighter of the two, but Saturn is still conspicuous.

This makes it about 37 degrees as bright as it was last summer, when it was at its peak. The ringed planet's elevation in the sky is not as high as it was then, but it can still be seen prominently in the south.

Though not as bright as earlier, Saturn is still a majestic object, with its famous ring system well displayed to observers. This is one of the best times of year to observe Saturn, with its rings tilted favorably toward the earth.

BRIGHT STARS VISIBLE

In addition to the planets, there are also nine bright stars in the sky this month, ranging from Aquarius to Vega. These include Altair, Vega, Denebola, Arcturus and others. They make a striking pattern across the southern and western sky, adding to the beauty of the June evening scene.

UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS CAUSE FORCE ALERT, AT McGUIRE AFB

As set Forth in the inclosed FOIW, fighter planes aere scrambled from McGuire Air Force Base on the night of June 7, 1957, due to the report that "UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT" were in the area. This report, though a request for the Aerial Visuals, was not positively identified after a scramble by fighter planes from McGuire AFB. The REPORT, though not a confirmed sighting of any UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT, CAIDOSEP [sic] A FORCE ALERT and scramble of jet fighter aircraft from McGuire Air Force Base which occurred between 8 and 9 p.m. on that date. An investigation is now being made concerning this alert, and any additional information as planned and transmitted to the Hq, USAF.

This incident, which probably was an unidentified aircraft,caused a FORCE ALERT at McGuire AFB on the night of 7 June 1957, though the objects were never positively identified even after the scramble of jet interceptors.

Information regarding this ALERT with McGuire AFB is being transmitted to the Hq USAF.

THREE LIGHTS IN FORMATION SEEN
Investigation  of this Incident

They were large, round objects, flying in a formation of three, the crew of a hoeing Line freighter, returning to San Francisco International Airport, first sighted at approximately 11:30 p.m. PS.T. on June 18, 1957. 

Capt. C. C. Martin, skipper of the freighter, reported that the objects were brilliantly lighted, moving faster than jets, and about 3,000 feet higher than his aircraft at that time. He estimated their speed at about 800 mph.

Chief Pilot Roy Mallon, who sighted the objects through the cockpit windows, described them as enormous, diffusing a cold, white light, and maneuvering in formation until they disappeared from view.

NCAP has asked for detailed reports from the United Air Lines and other commercial airlines which may have had similar observations. Military and commercial aviation officials have been requested to report any such sightings.

Dear Sir:

We are in receipt of your letter dated 8 July 1957 in which you report an unidentified flying object observed by you on the night of 3 June 1957.

This sighting has not been conclusively identified as yet. You are correct in stating that it was not one of the known Air Force balloons or other military aircraft and air training and other operations. A plot of the location given within a radius of 20 miles from three air bases in the area is enclosed.

There is no evidence that your may have observed a series of lights underneath an aircraft's defined for the purpose of testing ground-controlled approach equipment. A copy of your prompt reporting of the incident to proper authorities, and your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Director of Intelligence 
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sirs,

I am reporting an incident which occurred here in Easton, Maryland on June 6th, 1957.

On the date mentioned, at approximately 10:15 p.m., I observed a strange light in the sky. This light was unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. It was oblong in shape, with a reddish glow in the center, and surrounded by a blue-white halo. The object appeared to be hovering, and then suddenly shot off at a terrific speed, leaving no trail. I observed this phenomenon for several minutes before it disappeared from sight.

I would appreciate it if you would investigate this incident, as I am quite puzzled by what I saw. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

1957

Creator of Intelligent Manoeuvre Observed at Close Quarters

Dear Sir;

I am sending you a report of an unusual series of events I observed while on the farm one night last week. This is the only description I can give you as I am not a writer by profession, but being an eye witness to the strange occurrences, I feel it is my duty to report the facts as I saw them.

It was approximately 7:00 p.m. on the evening of May 26, 1957. I was outside in the barnyard attending to some routine chores when I noticed a peculiar light in the sky to the West of my position. At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but as I watched it, I realized it was not behaving like any aircraft I had ever seen. The light seemed to be hovering in one spot, occasionally darting off at great speed and then returning to its original position. 

As I continued to observe the strange light, it suddenly began to increase in size and brightness. Within a matter of seconds, it had grown to approximately 40 or 50 feet in diameter and was casting a bright white light over the entire barnyard. I was so startled by this sudden change that I froze in my tracks, unable to move. The light was so brilliant that it illuminated the entire area as bright as day. I stood there watching, transfixed, for what seemed like several minutes, although it was probably less than a minute in actual time.

Suddenly, the light began to decrease in size and brightness, until it had returned to its original state - a small, hovering light in the sky. It then darted off at tremendous speed, far exceeding the capabilities of any known aircraft, and disappeared from sight within a matter of seconds.

I stood there, stunned, trying to comprehend what I had just witnessed. I can assure you that this was no hallucination or figment of my imagination. I am a practical, down-to-earth person and have no history of fanciful beliefs. What I saw that night was as real as the barn in front of me. I hope you will take this report seriously and give it the consideration it deserves.

Sincerely,
Miss A. B. East
