"3:30-12:39
9 June 1954 
(UNCLASSIFIED) 
SUBJECT: USAF TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
Capt. Leonard H. Stringfield
Air Force Intelligence Center
Patrick Air Force Base, Florida

1. The following information is the continuation of a previous report made as a result of an investigation conducted in the vicinity of Patrick AFB, Florida, on 8 June 1954.

2. On 8 June 1954, at approximately 1300 hours, this office was notified by the Provost Marshal, Air Force Missile Test Center, that a number of unidentified flying objects were observed traveling at an extremely high rate of speed across the sky. An immediate check revealed that this observation coincided approximately with an inbound missile schedule from the missile range at that time. Investigation was instituted at once.

3. On 9 June 1954, as a result of this investigation, the following additional information was obtained:

a. Capt. Leonard H. Stringfield, OSI, stated that on 8 June 1954, they had reported this incident to the FBI at their Jacksonville, Florida, office. The FBI advised that they were looking into the Atlantic Ocean case as a result of previous reports concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects in that area. The number of witnesses was estimated to be over two hundred, and the intensity of the sighting was considered by all present as a flashlight-type beam, but considerably brighter. The light appeared to be moving in a northerly direction near the coast of Florida. The witnesses consist of officers, key administrative personnel and technical experts of the Missile Test Center, all of whom are thoroughly trained in missile identification and electronic warfare.

b. The witnesses were questioned individually and each gave a consistent account of what he had observed. Their reactions, both physical and psychological, were similar, indicating an intensity of observation which cannot be easily discredited. After an approximate 10 minute display, the light or lights faded from view. The witnesses stated that the intensity of the light varied and differed from the intensity and color of the automobile and aircraft signal lights in the vicinity.

c. One of the witnesses, a Capt. Stanton, advised that at one point, the object or objects which were observed appeared to be accompanied by a smaller object traveling at a high rate of speed. Capt. Stanton stated that the smaller object appeared on the left side of the main object and traveled at a very high rate of speed in a horizontal direction for a short distance, then disappeared from view. The main object then continued on in a northerly direction until it was no longer visible."

Object sighted to aim curve appeared to be at 3,000 ft. Altitude, very near ground. Course circular, anti-clockwise, circular, estimated speed 600-700 mph, luminous - light yellow-green in color, estimated diameter 40-50 ft. Observation made at 2139 hours. East wind - 10-15 mph, temperature 72 deg. F. Relative humidity - 88 percent. Barometer 30.18 inches. Ceiling unlimited, visibility 10 miles. This object traveled northerly course during this sighting. The rate of speed was greater than that of any aircraft observed. The object appeared to accelerate at a tremendous rate and was visible until dark. CANNOT PHOTOGRAPH - too small - largest observed last 17 mins. The object observed to be several times larger than the brightest visible star. A full moon was visible in the sky also. Object appeared to dart or zigzag at the lower side. It appeared as a light moved rapidly and disappeared. This was known as the "Willoughby Air Force Base Incident".

UNCLASSIFIED INVESTIGATIVE REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

13 June 1954, under the Office of Special Investigations, Office of the Inspector General, United States Air Force, was informed by a member of the air force that a strange object had been observed near Patrick Air Force Base, Florida at approximately 1540, 13 June 1954.

The object was first observed at 1530 as a white speck in the sky, and at 1540 it assumed a circular appearance and disappeared. The object was first observed from a car parked along the beach approximately 1.5 miles south of Patrick Air Force Base. The object was observed approximately 10-15 minutes. The object was observed to gain altitude, slow, speed up, and disappear. It was reported this was not the first time this object had been observed in this general area.

3. On 14 June 1954, 2/LT L. JENDICT, AF-12817444, received a telephone call from information concerning a sighting which occurred on 13 June 1954.

Observation made - 2120 hours, EST
Observed distance - 4,000 feet
Observed altitude - 12,500 feet
Observed speed - 300 miles per hour
Altitude - 29,960 inches
Durability - temperature - 74.4 degree Fahrenheit
Weather - balloon released at 2200 hours

6. On 15 June 1954, an air force reserve officer, Patrick Air Force Base, concerning the sighting of an unidentified object, conversed with Captain William F. Brennan, Base Operations Officer, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, advised that the object observed 13 June 1954 information to the effect that the object was not of this world, and suspected that the object was of interplanetary origin. Tests were planned to determine the object's approximate height, speed, and other pertinent data.

EXTRACT TEXT:
ON 16 June 1954, Hajor l. H. HUNT, APFIC, OOLLIBUnD TEST CliBTER, PATRICK Allr FORCE BASE, FLORIDA, reported a sighting of an unidentified flying object over the COLLIER TESTRANGE site on the west side of the BANANA RIVER, approximately one (l) mile NE of PATRICK AFD, FLORIDA. 

Major HUNT stated that at approximately 1230 hours, while making a visual observation from the PATRICK AFD range tower, he sighted a metallic, disc-shaped object moving at a high rate of speed, climbing in a southeasterly direction at about a 45 degree angle. Re stated that the object was sighted for approximately four (4) minutes, moving along an irregular course and at one time seemed to be moving at a speed in excess of 900 kn~ts. The object, according to Major HUNT, appeared to be larger than an automobile and was characterized as much brighter than a flashbulb burst, out approximately the angular size of a half dollar coin held at arm's length. 

Major HUNT further stated that after the object had climbed to an altitude he estimated to be forty (40) feet at the end of the sighting, it appeared to stop, hover, and then reverse its direction and descend at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight.

All of the above information was furnished mainly to establish credibility and air data was believed as reliable, in 15 and 17 foot per second, normal air speed.

The document contains a handwritten note that says "DIS CSI (C-2)" as well as some other handwritten text, but does not include any photographs or images.

OBSERVATION REPORT

   On 8 June 1954 at about 1215 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed over Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.  The object was first sighted in the northeast quadrant of the sky at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees.  It was moving in a southwesterly direction at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour.  The object appeared to be flat, elongated, and approximately 30 to 40 feet in length.  It had a metallic-like appearance and was emitting a bright white light.  The object was observed for approximately one minute and then disappeared from sight.  Two separate observers reported the sighting.  One observer, a Lt. Col. in the USAF, observed the object through 7 x 50 binoculars and stated that the object appeared to be completely silent and without trails or visible means of propulsion.  The other observer, a Major in the USAF, observed the object with the naked eye and stated that the object changed course abruptly at one point during the sighting.  Both observers are considered to be reliable and credible.  This sighting was investigated by the Project Blue Book staff and was determined to be "unknown".
