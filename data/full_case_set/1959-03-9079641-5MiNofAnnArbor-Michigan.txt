AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
CONTROL SYMBOL: DIR CTR 760-Os
DATE OF REPORT: 30 June 1959
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting at 5:35 AM, 24 March 1959, 5 Miles NW of Ann Arbor, Michigan.
PREPARED BY: RA3/C 
SOURCE: ARI_   
SUMMARY: (Unless otherwise specified in the report, the information in this paragraph is based on the immediate observations and personal opinion of the source. Add information on Source not in separate paragraph. Report Type of Report in AF Form 112--Part II.)
At approximately 5:35 AM, 24 March 1959, the witness observed a brilliant, silvery, disc-shaped object moving very rapidly at an altitude of approximately 150 feet above the ground. The object was emitting a bright, flashing light and was traveling in a straight line from north to south at a high rate of speed. The witness observed the object for approximately 15 to 20 seconds before it disappeared from view. The witness is a resident of the area and was on his way to work when he observed the object. The witness has no explanation for what he observed and considers the object to be of an unidentified nature. No other witnesses have reported observing this object.

Major Robert J. Friend

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Friend:

I think that you and your associates will be amused at the flying saucer report I want to acknowledge - that fairly wide coverage is given this incident since it is related to the idea about its connection with our consulting fee. I wish, however, that all of our cases could be so neatly solved!

I will shortly submit my expenses incurred on the past trip and I hope for your understanding. I will also promise that the consulting fee previously agreed upon between us will now be forthcoming. I think I can keep my records straight, if this is more helpful to you this way. You will hear from me in about a week on this matter.

I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of giving the talk the other day and I am particularly glad we had a two-star General officer in the audience since my acquaintance with those things seems more seriously received, especially by officials of the type to which these guests must be accustomed to seeing - the top echelons of our Armed Forces as the source of such authority and knowledge on these matters, and if we can show them on such occasions the evidently thorough treatment of these things, we lay ourselves open to a greater deal of confidence. It is this that I had hoped you would gain, and even impressed these points so strongly. You will be hearing from me.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek
Associate Director

Transcribed text:

Dear Allen:

Here is the flying saucer story I referred to in my last letter. Since you have been on an evaluation board, you may be amused.

It is an interesting example of pretty objective observation by the people who thought they saw a "flying saucer". They later even described the ringlike structure of telescope dish, which is covered only with a wire mesh, of course. All they described was the turning off of the lights underneath and those small movements of telescope from the roadside for motion!

Sincerely,

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed document containing text, likely an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report.

From the Ann Arbor News, March 23, 1959

1. The U of M 85' radio telescope is clearly visible from North Territorial Rd.
2. The top of Peach Mountain is "low in the sky."
3. At the time of observation (1:30 a.m.), the dish was looking at the SW horizon and illuminated by the light of a full (almost) moon and a floodlight.
4. The WWDR radio tower with its red aircraft warning lights is directly in line with the radio telescope as viewed from the intersection of North Territorial and Peach Mountain.
5. The dish was being rotated from the SW horizon to the zenith so that an observer on the ground would see less and less of its surface and more of its bird-cage-like structure.
6. When the dish reached the zenith, the floodlights were turned off, the dish "seemed to go into the sky," and we went home.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting in the sky. The document provides details about the sighting, including the size, movements, and luminous qualities of the object observed. It also mentions the involvement of ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) officials and the use of a telescope to observe the object. The text is a descriptive account of the incident.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 99--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Heading to the city south of the road. According to their report 
to the Air Force, the U.F.O. was an illuminated object, something like a ball, 
something like a little car, and brilliantly illuminated by two very intense
light beams that seemed to shine from the bottom and converged over the top. 
Frightened at this apparition, the witnesses could provide only uncertain estimates 
of distance and size. The object seemed to be of twenty to thirty feet in diameter, 
was at an altitude of about 500 feet when first seen, and was hovering about two miles away. 
As they drove on, the object seemed to move and travel parallel with the car for about a mile. 
The object's lights dimmed and a circle of some kind appeared on the underside, 
and then the lights rose vertically, very rapidly, paused, and vanished in a few seconds.

Checking the most probable explanations first, ATIC officials
found that the nearby Willow Run Airport had no aircraft in the area and that no star or planet seemed to be involved. Further investigation showed that the flying bird cage was
actually the escape telescope of the University of Michigan. This telescope was installed on the top of Peach Mountain. It was clearly visible from the road on which the witnesses were traveling.
The dish, which the witnesses took for the object, was a wire-mesh structure that suggested the bird cage. At the time of the sighting the dish was turning in the direction of the witnesses and was illuminated by a floodlight as well as by the bright moonlight. It had apparently attracted the car only because the car itself was moving.
The astronomers operating the telescope were rotating the dish from the horizon to the zenith, and the yellow lights dimmed because the witnesses were seeing less and less of the surface. The "circle of red lights" on the
"roof" were the red aircraft warning lights on the nearby WUOM radio and TV tower between Peachey and the witnesses. When the dish reached the zenith and the operating crew turned off the floodlights, the dish was no longer visible to the witnesses, who interpreted the sudden disappearance as a sudden vertical ascent into the sky [1].

Michigan's Flying Bird Cage

A UFO sighting based on mistaken identification of strange lights occurred in the early morning hours of March 22, 1959, near Ann Arbor, Michigan. The night was clear, the moon was nearly full, and visibility was unusually good. At about 1:30 A.M. a man and his wife driving on a country road suddenly noticed a strange object.
