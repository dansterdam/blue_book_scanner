1. The Security Officer of the 1947th AACS Squadron, Wiesbaden, Germany, reports the appearance of unidentified objects on radar observed by a GCA crew during the night of 7 July 1950. The GCA radar detected the objects at an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet. This operated over a period of approximately 15-20 minutes.
2. The sources stated that after observation the new targets for several minutes, appeared to separate into 4 or 5 blurred individual targets, spaced 900 to 1000 yards apart. The targets seemed to be moving at an extremely high speed, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 miles per hour, and at an angle too high for a good target return. The targets were then lost from sight, approximately 21:07 as the operation's concentration shift.
According to the two sources, the speed of the unidentified objects suggested the possibility of their being jet aircraft.
The Wiesbaden control tower operator was contacted after the observation, he stated that no jet aircraft were known to be flying in the area at that time.
An airman of the 1947th AACS Squadron, occupying quarters in the town of Wiesbaden, reported to the organization's Security Officer that he heard sounds similar to those made by low-flying jet aircraft at about 2300Z on 7 July 1950. The airman reportedly made this statement without advance knowledge of the radar observation.
