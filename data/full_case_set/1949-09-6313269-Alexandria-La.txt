10. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was round and was comparable to the brilliance of the
dazzling sun, as if it suddenly became aflame and shot across
the sky. The object was in view only a mere instant. There
was no evidence of exhaust or trails, no sound was heard, and
the object did not appear to be supported by any discern-
able means.

This is an initial report.

On 2 September 1949, at approximately 1930 hours, CDT, Mrs. -------------------
while sitting in the company of her grandaughter, ----------------, on the porch of her resi-
dence at ---------------, Alexandria, Louisiana, observed a strange ap-
paratus, "about 30 inches in size", rise from a hole which two electricians from a local
electrical company the afternoon of 1 September 1949, made in the street
hole to the "across the street" fixture then lightning." The object drifted across the street,
was round, was not projected or supported by any discernable means, and re-
mained in view "a mere instant."
