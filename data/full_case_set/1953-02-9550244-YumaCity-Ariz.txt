February 6, 1953

"SIGHTINGS OF FLYING OBJECTS"

The location, Yuma, Arizona. At approximately 1:15 p.m., February 6, 1953, I was using a theodolite to follow a pilot balloon, which was ascending at a rate of about 700 feet per minute. The theodolite was set at 55 degrees elevation, and the balloon was out of sight, having reached an altitude of approximately 27,500 feet. I had my eye glued to the eyepiece of the theodolite, and although it was a clear day, I saw a small silvery-white object approaching from the north. I had a clear unobstructed view of the object as it passed overhead, at an estimated elevation of approximately 15,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was traveling at a high rate of speed. I noticed no sound or exhaust from the object. As it passed overhead, I lost sight of it as it went behind the theodolite.

The objects were both the same size as early as I could determine, and I would estimate the diameter to be approximately 30 feet. The objects were shiny-silver in color and appeared to be traveling at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour.

I am a Meteorological Aid employed with the United States Weather Bureau, having followed balloons through a theodolite for the past ten years.

I am absolutely certain of what I have seen through the theodolite as described in the foregoing paragraphs.

The text in the document is as follows:

Yuma City, Arizona
4 February 1953

I. Description of Incident:
At 12:30 MST on the 3 February 1953, the U.S. Weather Bureau was searching for a 1,000 weather balloon with the aid of a theodolite when, at a distance of 10 to 12 miles, the observer observed an object at an elevation of 55-60 degrees. The size of the object consisted of one minute of arc.
The object appeared to be ascending straight up, then leveled off and at this point this object apparently went off due west at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

II. Discussion of Incident:
From the observer's previous experience in tracking balloons, it is concluded that these objects could not have been balloons especially since they were seen to move against the wind. There were aircraft in the area but the observer states he was aware of them and could not have confused them with the unknown objects. Because of the manner and the time of day, an astronomical solution must be ruled out.

III. Conclusion:
Unknown.

The report states that on February 9, 1953, at Yuma City, Arizona, a strange object was sighted in the sky. The object was estimated to be 40-50 feet in diameter, disc-shaped, and grayish in color. It was observed for approximately 30 minutes as it moved in an erratic pattern, stopping and starting at various points. The witness reported that the object appeared to have no visible means of propulsion. No further details or analysis are provided in the available text.
