October 21, 1953

Report to: Air Intelligence Service Squadron, Flight 2A

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT

The sighting described below took place during the theodolite tracking of a 79 ft. balloon floating at approximately 50,000 ft. on Project #5321.
Grab Bag: Observation was made from the 2003 East Hennepin Avenue.

The time was between 1010 and 1015 CST on 15 Oct. 53. No sound was detected at any time during the observation.

The object was first observed as it passed below the sun at an elevation of approximately 25Â° heading southward in horizontal flight. It was detectable by a sudden increase in speed from 5-10 miles per hour to an estimated 1000 miles per hour. It did not persist, or form a cloud. The object itself was highly visible even through the theodolite, which was actually part of the sighting.

During the horizontal part of its trajectory, the object moved across the sky at a rate of 10 degrees in 9 seconds. With an estimated altitude of 40,000 ft., this represents a rate of 75 miles per minute or 900 miles per hour.

After about 10 seconds of horizontal flight, the object appeared to go into a vertical dive. The possibility that the appearance of a dive was produced by the object merely speeding into the distance seems unlikely since the speed was normal to the line of sight was undetermined in the dive. The dive was completed in less than 10 seconds, and if the object attained the 1000 mph rate achieved earlier, it would have taken the object less than 2 seconds to reach the ground. Just at this time the vapor trail ceased, and after about 2 to 3 seconds, the object, its outline still unrecognizable, was seen through the theodolite, not as a glare (as expected) but as a dark spot of considerable size, about the size of a B-29 (75 ft. wing span).

The observers believe that the object was most likely a jet aircraft, but several features were unusual.

1. The speed was higher than normally observed.
2. The unusual dive was highly dangerous if not suicidal maneuver.
3. A jet aircraft in such a dive would be heard for miles, and would certainly cause a noticeable shock wave detectable in the area beneath it.

It was thought that the Air Defense Command would be interested in what was seen, if:
a. They had no aircraft in the vicinity which could account for it, or if
b. They had an aircraft incident which might be partly explained by this report.

While observing a balloon car (about 4 feet a white trail appeared in the sky coming from behind part of the building structure (cross or block). It first appeared to be just wisps of vapor, but shortly they began to materialize into a complete jet stream trail. This trail of the smoke train dispersed away to the east. The leading edge or the smoke trail dispersed at about the same rate as the trail was formed. The trail remaining about continuous and equal to maximum length at all times. As this train was forming the vertical movement became very rapid, probably about as fast as the horizontal velocity. As the trail began to disappear, the trail became less continuous and finally dissipated. At the same time, two flashes were seen, which we assumed to be reflections from the sun at the distant or moving axis. This could be expected from maneuvers in a conventional craft.

The text on the page is as follows:

THE QUESTIONABLE ASPECTS OF THE SIGHTING

The time of the observation and the true character of the object are questionable.

For Visually Tracked Targets, The Speed and The Abrupt Changes Of Direction Are Especially Puzzling. Speed Using The Equation Angle (A SEC) AND THE Rate Of Angular Travel (ABOUT 1 MINUTE PER SEC) VELOCITIES CAN BE COMPUTED BY ASSUMING DIFFERENT ALTITUDES AND DISTANCES AWAY FOR THE OBJECT.

UNDER ASSUMPTIONS FROM 3,000 FT TO 30,000 FT ALTITUDE, THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING BETWEEN 600 & 1,800 MARK. EVEN ASSUMING A CONSERVATIVE 20% ERROR, THE OBJECT WAS PROBABLY MOVING AT GREATER THAN SONIC VELOCITY. YARDSTICK MOVEMENT OF THIS MAGNITUDE FOR 10-15 SEC WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY DANGEROUS IN NORMAL OPERATIONAL AIRCRAFT.

SIGNATURE: [REDACTED]
DATE: 21 - OCT - 1953

On 13 Oct. 1953 at 19:30 white object was observed in the sky. Estimate about 25,000 to 30,000 ft. The object flashed at the speed of approaching jet. No sound. Object drifted silently through the sky, maneuvered with ease, sped up and disappeared from view. After the initial period of the flight had gone well into the vertical phase of the craft, it made a sharp turn and dashed horizontally at tremendous speed. Astonished at this complete change in directional control of the object. The time of the observation was approximately two minutes. After the initial observing period, the object appeared to come into the vertical phase of the maneuver, traveling with no noticeable sound and then dashed off to the horizon at much greater speed than any existing aircraft I have observed with the naked eye. This was quite an experience and I believe the object to be a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically an Air Intelligence Information Report dated 21 Oct 1953 concerning an unidentified flying object sighted near Ft. Snelling, Minnesota.

Text from the document:

I. SUMMARY: An unidentified flying object was reported by three (3) laboratory technicians at Ft. SNELLING, Minnesota on 15 Oct 1953. The object was observed for approximately 12 minutes and was estimated to have flown at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet between 1015 and 1033 hours. 

The object was first observed as a small, cigar-like smoke trail heading southward at high speed. It was observed to make a sharp turn to the west and then continue on its course heading on a westerly direction. The entire observation was made visually and through 8x binoculars. The object was described as being a bright, metallic-like color which at times appeared to be emitting smoke or vapor. During the observation, the object at times appeared to be diving and then climbing rapidly in an erratic flight pattern.

II. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: Technical personnel who observed the object consist of two electronics engineers with over ten years experience each in aerodynamics, gyros, and servomechanisms. A third observer was a technician experienced in radar-engineering work. All three observers are considered fully qualified to make such observations and their descriptions are believed to be accurate.

That information has been obtained from SOURCES is believed to be reliable. The estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet is based upon the estimated size of the object and the known angle of elevation during the observation. No specific estimates were given in the vicinity of 40,000 feet, but upon inquiry all estimated altitudes were within the 10,000 to 15,000 foot range.

THREE MEN AGREED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN AS HIGH AS 60,000 FEET SINCE THEY COULD ORIGINALLY DETERMINE THE ALTITUDE WITH THE NAKED EYE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 10,000 FEET. POSITIVE ESTIMATE AS TO THE DEPTH OF FIELD FROM THE OBSERVATION POST IS UNKNOWN, BUT REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS FINALLY LOST TO OBSERVATION.

THE NEAREST USAF FACILITY TO THIS POINT OF OBSERVATION SHOWN ON THE MAP WAS 25 MILES BY AIR OR 30 MILES BY ROAD. HOWEVER, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS A COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND WAS WITHIN 2 MINUTES OF FLIGHT TIME OF THIS FACILITY. THIS TENDS TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING AN AIRCRAFT FROM A NEARBY AIR FORCE BASE OR OTHER INSTALLATION.
