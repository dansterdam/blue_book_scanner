The image appears to be a Project 10973 record card from the Project Blue Book archives. The image does not contain any photographic content, but rather displays a form with various fields such as "Date", "Location", "Type of Observation", "Shape", "Size", "Manner of Observation", "Number of Objects", and "Course". The form appears to be filled out with handwritten notes.
