This page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book does not contain any photographs. However, I can provide the text from the document using optical character recognition (OCR):

UNCLASSIFIED
12 January 1957

SUBJECT: Late receipt of UFO reports

1. This is one of six (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover by the 4602d AISS, who received them from the 1st (reference "46022 AISS File," letter dated 26 December 1956, subject: "O.I. UFOB Reports.").

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest, to over 7 months for the newest (August 1956). It appears that the OSI had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reason before submitting them.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis difficult. AF has emplaced in the files a preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be a confidential report or investigation related to a UFO sighting or incident. The text in the document is written in cursive and covers various details and observations about the incident, including mentions of "the greatest mystery that the world has ever known" and discussions of the characteristics and movement of the observed object.

It is one of the greatest mystries that the world has ever known and could be
reatiled as far more important than atom bomb reserch since it involves the 
existance of life outside of the world. The object I saw was about 30 feet in
diameter, round and revolving. I could see the top and bottom of the object as
it rotated at a high rate of speed and it seemed to be on the or quite near the
ground when I first saw it. The object was a dull metalic color and there were
no lights on it. As I watched it, it suddenly accellerated at a phenomenal
rate of speed and in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds was out of sight traveling in
a northerly direction. I am a World War II veteran and have had some air-
plane experience and I have never seen anything like this before. I would
appreciate your investigating this matter further and let me have some information
on the results of your investigation.

The image provided does not contain a photograph, but instead appears to be a handwritten document or report. The text in the image is blurred and difficult to read, but it seems to be a written account or description of some sort of unidentified flying object or phenomenon.

Here is the text from the document, as accurately transcribed as possible:

"It seems and after leaving the state that the stops myself as to what I thought they could be and how they could affect us, I was baffled. When they left with the light, which I could see from the porch, I watched them until I could no more. What was the significance of their coming and going in such a strange manner? If only I knew how to interpret this strange occurrence, it might help solve the mystery. As it was, I could only conjecture. I felt that this was no ordinary sighting, for the strange maneuvers and the brilliant light they displayed were quite different from anything I had ever seen before. It left me puzzled and concerned, for I had no way of knowing what implications this might hold. I could only hope that further information might come to light that would shed some understanding on what I had witnessed that night."

Transcribed text:

We are familiar with the earth's surface
to know about full and sky misty flight?
Consider and analyze carefully the story
of the recent flame light. Others believe the
true has been told that of this strange
craft. Many people have been
working on this program and are convinced
there are many strange phenomena in the
skies that defy explanation. They
are anxious this information should
reach proper authorities. Records of
offices of special investigations are
confidential.

Attention is invited to the fact that the information contained in this letter has not been of sufficient importance to warrant any report or record of investigation by this office.
