This page from the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. The text presented is an analysis of the infrared properties of an unidentified object.

The text reads:

Valoroscopic examination: This preparation when viewed by transmitted illumination was found to consist of sand-grains covered with a carbonized coating.

The greenish object was sawyd in half and the cross section appeared to be made up entirely of green polystrene except for a few black carbonized stronas which appeared to be the same as the carbonized material on the outer portion. No cloth was apparent within the cross section.

Infrared Analysis:
A chloroform extract was obtained from the dirt for infrared absorption analysis. The black extract was found to contain a long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon plus some aromatics. More aromatic absorption was found in this extract than normally occurs in most motor fuels. The spectrum appeared slightly lower in energy to be that of a fuel oil.

The greenish-appearing material, which made up most of the object, was analyzed by infrared absorption techniques and found to be polystyrene.

A black material scraped from the surface of the object was found to be sand plus clay plus hydrocarbon (probably the same as found in the surrounding earth) by infrared analysis.

Analyses of fibers from the object by infrared absorption methods gave mainly absorption bands for SiO2 (probably from the sand) plus traces of polystyrene and traces of hydrocarbon. The fibers gave other bands which appear in the right wavelength region to be caused probably by cellulose.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, providing details on emission spectrographic analyses of various portions of an unidentified object and surrounding debris.

Emission Spectrographic Analyses

The data for qualitative emission spectrographic analyses of various portions of the unidentified object and surrounding debris are given in Table I. The portions analyzed are identified as follows:

(1) Earth from jar
(2) Chloroform extract of earth from jar
(3) Sandy material from object
(4) Chain-link cloth from object
(5) Stratige fiber from object
(6) Green plastic from outside surface of object
(7) Green plastic material from inside surface of object
(8) Sample from black streak on sectioned surface

An indication of the relative amount of each element present in the samples is given by the symbols +, ++, or +++ for high, medium, or low traces, or none found, respectively. The results must be tempered from sample to sample because of differences in sample weights. The samples of earth and plastic were large, being of the order of 1 to 15 milliliters, whereas the other samples were small bulks of the order of fractions of a milligram. No unusual amounts nor contents of elements were found for the samples analyzed -- i.e., the findings were in accord with that of a sand-cemented plastic object and many earth extracted with oil. No indication of the cause of the green color in the plastic was found.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text describing the findings of a radioactivity check and conclusions based on the examination of the sample.

Text extracted from the document:

WAS FOUND STICHED BY EMISSION SPECTROGRAPHIC OR BY INFRARED ABSORPTION ANALYSIS. SMALL AMOUNTS OF SOME ELEMENTS ARE PRESENT TO WHICH ARE POSSIBLY FOR COLORING AND WOULD NOT BE DETECTED ORDINARILY BY INFRARED OPTICAL ANALYSIS AT THESE LOW CONCENTRATIONS.

RADIOACTIVITY CHECK

A CHECK FOR RADIOACTIVITY OF THE SAMPLE, MEASURED WITH A SURVEY METER, SHOWED LITTLE IF ANY RADIATION ABOVE THE NORMAL BACKGROUND LEVEL.

CONCLUSIONS

BASED ON THE ABOVE DESCRIBED EXAMINATION AND DATA OUR CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT THE SAMPLE IS A PIECE OF GREEN-COLORED POLYSTYRENE PLASTIC OF THE INEXPENSIVE TYPE COMMONLY USED FOR TOYS, TILE, ETC. SINCE (1) POLYSTYRENE OBJECTS ARE NOT COMMONLY REINFORCED WITH CLOTH, (2) THE CHARRED CLOTH TREATMENT ONLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE OBJECT, (3) THE ODOR AND INFRARED DATA ON THE SURROUNDING EARTH INDICATES THAT IT WAS PROBABLY SATURATED WITH FUEL OIL, AND (4) THE PLASTIC WAS APPARENTLY HOT ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN MOLTEN, IT IS INDICATED LIKELY THAT THIS IS MERELY A PLASTIC OBJECT WHICH HAS BEEN COVERED WITH A COTTON CLOTH SATURATED WITH FUEL OIL AND BURNED AT A HIGH ENOUGH TEMPERATURE TO CAUSE THE PLASTIC TO BECOME MOLTEN. IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE OBJECT ENTERED FROM OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE SINCE THE MOLTEN FATE OF POLYSTYRENE IS LOW AND THE OBJECT WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE BURNED COMPLETELY UPON ENTERING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL SPECIMEN
6 August 1964

UNITED AIR FORCE RECRUITING OFFICE 214-11
ROOM M-10
FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING
PADUCAH, KENTUCKY

1. The object which Mrs. X turned over to you and which was analyzed by our office. A copy of this report is attached. You may inform Mrs. X that the results of our analysis indicate that the object does not represent the results of any type of meteorological or other phenomenon, since the object itself was consumed in the analysis. Essentially the object has the characteristics of a material resembling a cotton cloth saturated with fuel oil and burned. While we are uncertain as to the exact nature of the object, it was definitely not of a metallic nature.

2. While this office did not have the opportunity to physically examine the object, we are of the opinion that it was in her backyard.

3. Your attention is directed to your action in insuring that the Air Force did not obtain an object of potential scientific value.

Preliminary Report on a Classic Sample - "Moon Dust" 
8 grams is a bit of greyish material. There color is varying and normal. It appears to be a glinty object (a crystal for liquids ?) with an ettery luster, as callopilated as itself.
The material has inclusions as crystal from quartz or material?. There are some standing points, probably from grass or insect resist in "crust formation".
But increases as mostly and (silvery). This would be the use of the fine red dust, but enough to come out the organic matter particles in softening.
Radiation level is quite outstanding.

Suggested: A sample was a little shaped pyramid contains 92.09 reported to increase incoming, and was for some similar.

Writer repeat will follow.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report document discussing the examination of "greenish objects" and "samples of earth and grass" under microscopic and infrared absorption methods. The text provides details about the observations and conclusions drawn from these analyses, which were discussed with plastic and petroleum specialists. The document mentions photomacrographs were taken of the examined material, but no actual photographs are included in this particular page.

EXAMINATION OF SAMPLES

The greenish object and the samples of earth and grass which surrounded it were examined microscopically and analyzed by emission spectrographs and infrared absorption methods. The data for these analyses and observations are given in this report. The objects and the results have been discussed with plastic and petroleum specialists and our observations and conclusions are included in the latter part of this report.

EXPERIMENTAL
Microscopic and Visual Examinations

Examinations of the greenish object visually and microscopically revealed that probably it had been charred and distorted by having been heated to a molten state. One side was covered with sand and plant detritus; the latter appeared to be mostly grass roots. This side appeared to be mostly grass roots. This side also displayed some partially exposed embedded cloth. The other side was primarily greenish-plastic in appearance. Emphasis, in the microscopic examination, was placed on the identification of the charred material. This appeared to be an unusual finding. It was found to be a cotton cloth having a chain-like weft type welit. Photomicrographs were taken of: (1) the cloth in the plastic; (2) three lines of the knit removed from the cloth embedded in the plastic; and (3) fibers from a thread of the cloth. These are included as Figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

A specimen of the dirt, collected from the reported 8-inch diameter core accompanying the greenish-colored, was prepared by mineralogical polishing techniques for examination in every and a thin-section was prepared by mineralogical polishing techniques for examination.
