1st Lieutenant P.H. Oldson

Dayton, Ohio

Dear First Lieutenant:

Thank you for your letter and comments. I too think that we are getting some interesting and unusual UFO cases in Ohio lately. These seem to be rather puzzling, truly unknown cases with their follow-up so short a true scientific evaluation is difficult. I hope we can follow up on critical points the next cases had little scientific value.

We should in time be able to set up some experiments to demonstrate these phenomena, but like with the atom bomb, this can come only by selecting proper cases and letting the majority of them go by the boards.

I hope that you will continue with this work and that we can have occasional consulting.

Well, here were on this batch of 15 March, 4 of the 12 cases in this batch, J. weighed unclassification tentative, and 5 remain unresolved. Two have insufficient data and are referring to the same incident seem to be worth definite.

Just for the record, the Venus cases were March 6 (near center), 5.15 and 10.55. These are the only cases I can assemble that are of some interest. The most important is at Shaw AFB, the details of the incident there that are most interesting so far as, I personally wonder how the object could have approached 250 mph and still have been visible to the observers. Compares AFB a few hours later refer to the same thing?

The previous reports about 20 to 25 of the March 3, 1953 case a 30 feet by 30 feet disc-form object hovered about 40 feet down observations to keep one point eyes on the object.

I am, sir
