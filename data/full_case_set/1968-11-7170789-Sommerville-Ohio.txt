The image appears to be a hand-drawn map of a general area, likely related to a UFO sighting. The map shows several geographic locations and landmarks, including "Grafton", "Seven mile", "Middletown", and "South western Ohio Preble County". The text at the bottom indicates that this is a "Map of General Area" where a "UFO sighted" and a "UFO Crest car" were observed.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sir:

I would like to report the sighting of a UFO. It happened on November 13, 1968 in Sommerville, Ohio. My wife, my two daughters, and myself were driving North on Jacksonburg-Gratis Road toward State Route 4002. We may have seen more than these, but I do not believe in any type of science fiction or other wild type things.

We noticed this light in the sky. It caught our attention immediately. We all looked to the "lights", and they were saying "it's us". These lights turned down the cars, and we began to look back with our lights on the car, and we could see five lights attached, but we could not distinguish the shape because of the reflection of the lights on my dashboard. The lights still turned off, and they were still on - the lights on my dashboard turned off. The lights still remain, shining around in the sky.

By this time I had driven perhaps one-half mile, and the lights were beginning to disappear and turned down near the windshield and began to pull down the corner of the windshield. As we reached the house, the lights became a huge size object. The lights would come on and off. It remained that way, it would turn off, and it would remain a huge size object. The lights were blinking around very fast.

I looked at it for quite a while, but I never got the nerve to stop the car, and keep going because I was so shook up about the sound of the engine on my car. Presently, I came to the end of Jacksonburg-Gratis Road and stopped. The lights by this time had practically disappeared. We got out of the car and stared, but nothing was left. Writing is seems to be a logical way I would put it. It hovered over us, and turned off and on many times, and I could hardly believe my eyes.

I turned to the right, and looked ever to my left shoulder. The next thing I saw turning to my right, and the light get BLINDING. The thing disappeared, and I turned very quickly because it frightened me in my life. I tried to outrace it, but it kept perfect pace with me.

I got home, and my wife and daughters were out of their minds, screaming and everything. At the first I didn't know what it was, and in Gratis, I turned right again. We drove on far a block, parked the car, and got out to watch. By this time the directions had just ceased, and we saw it it pretty well in the direction of Eaton, due North, and we saw it didn't seem to be in the direction of Eaton.

Of course, this is an extremely true story the way I saw it, and I can't explain it the way I would want to. I knew what it was, if only I knew I hope I never see it again. I had the strangest sensation it wanted to communicate with me, but I sure didn't want any part of it.

Dear Sir:
I would like to report the sighting of a UFO. It happened on November 13, 1968. Myself, my husband, and our two daughters were driving North on Jacksonburg-Gratis Road toward state Route 27. I was riding in the front seat with my husband, and the girls were in the backseat. We believe in any type or science fiction or other wild type things.
We noticed a flight of lights and called our attention to it. We were driving up a hill, and the lights seemed to be coasting up over the hill ahead of us. The lights were moving, and they were moving in a strange way. I slowed down the car, and we began to look at the lights as they came up in the sky. Suddenly the lights seemed to line up in a straight line, and they all turned off simultaneously. The lights went off at the same time, and there was no reflection of the lights on my dashboard.
By this time I had driven perhaps one-half mile, and the lights were beginning to appear again. The lights then seemed to follow our car, first on one side and then on the other. There was a huge gray object. The lights would come on and off. It reminded me of a huge gray object. The lights would come on and off, to-remind me of a huge strange object.
I looked at it for quite a while, but I never got the nerve to stop the car, and get out. I was afraid there was some danger, that we could not command.
Presently I came to the end of Jacksonburg-Gratis Road and stopped. The lights with both seemed to be remaining went directly in front of the car and stopped. The waiting it seemed to me to observe which way I would go. It hovered over the car at this time.
I turned to the right, and looked over my left shoulder. The next thing I saw was the lights dissolving, and I think disappearing. The lights seemed to just fold into "itself" and disappeared from sight. This was the strangest thing I have ever witnessed in my life. I tried to outdrove it, but it kept perfect pace with me.
Gratis is only about a short distance from where I turned right. At the first street in Gratis, I turned right again. We drove on for a little, parked the car, and got out to look at the field where the lights had come from. There was nothing to be seen.
We went home, and sat up until nearly daylight, but there was never any more sightings.
There are two identically the same thing. I can't explain it. I don't know what it was, only know it happened. I never saw it again. This has convinced me that there is something out there I am not familiar with, and I am not sure I want to be.

The image contains two photographs. The first photograph is a compass-like diagram showing the directions of movement of a phenomenon, likely a UFO. The second and third photographs depict two landscape scenes with a person or persons standing in the foreground.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

AFR 80-17(C)

AS NOW IMAGINED, YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS SHOWN - THIS IS AS YOU WOULD VIEW IT FROM THE OBSERVATION POINT. EACH SMALL ARROW INDICATES THE DIRECTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. THE LARGE ARROWS INDICATE THE GENERAL DIRECTION TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE MOVEMENT.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, AS GY YOU THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN AND AS AT IT MOVED. THE SHADED AREAS SHOW GRAPHICALLY THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN SAY, AND THE THAT IT SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ARC-LIKE. REFER TO SCALE AS AN ESTIMATE OF HOW TO COMPLETE.

The image contains a hand-drawn diagram with various annotations. The diagram appears to depict the sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon, likely a UFO. There is no photographic image present in this particular page from the Project Blue Book document.
