1. Request your review and analysis of subject UFO report received from the 725th ACW Squadron, Cambria AF Station, California.

[Handwritten text at the bottom]
It is my view the object or objects in this sighting were high altitude weather ballons or phenomena explainable in natural scientific terms. There are no indications of unusual or strange findings that would warrant further investigation or special analysis of this report.
