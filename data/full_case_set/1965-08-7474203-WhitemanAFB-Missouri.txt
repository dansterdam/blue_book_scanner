STATEMENT OF INCIDENT

1. On 7 August 1965, at approximately 1810 hours, this observer, a Lt Col in the USAF, observed an unusual aerial phenomenon over Whiteman AFB, Missouri. While standing in the open on the west ramp of the base, I observed a white, disc-shaped object moving in a horizontal direction from north to south approximately 5 miles west of the field at an estimated altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 feet. The object appeared stationary for approximately 30 seconds, then accelerated at a very high rate of speed, and disappeared from sight within a matter of seconds.

2. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes. Weather conditions were clear. The object was definitely not an aircraft, missile, or bird. It appeared to be under intelligent control and its departure from the area was abrupt and rapid. I have no explanation for what I observed.

3. I have discussed this incident with several other personnel at this base, and they confirm that they also observed the same object at the same time and place.

On July 20, 1965, a red light was observed by Captain William L. Thompson, USAF of the 351st Strategic Missile Wing, Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The light was observed for approximately 30 minutes from 0130 to 0200 hours. The following is Captain Thompson's statement describing the incident:

"On 20 July 1965, I was on alert duty in Missile Crew Building No. 2 at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. At approximately 0130 hours, I looked out the south window and observed a red light in the sky. The light appeared to be stationary or hovering at an estimated altitude of 1500 feet and at a distance of approximately 5 miles from the base. The light flashed on and off at irregular intervals. At times, the light appeared to change size and shape, and occasionally it appeared to pulse or throb. I observed the light for about 30 minutes until it disappeared from view at approximately 0200 hours. During the time I observed the light, it remained stationary and did not appear to move.

At approximately 0215 hours, I called the Command Post and reported the sighting. The Command Post acknowledged my report and stated that the object had also been observed by other personnel at the base. No aircraft were observed in the vicinity of the light during the time it was under observation."

SUMMARY OF CASE:
On 7 August 1965, at approximately 8:30 p.m. local time, the control tower at Whiteman A.F.B., Missouri reported sighting an unidentified flying object over the base. The object was described as a bright light which appeared to be hovering over the north end of the base for approximately 3 minutes. The object then began to move rapidly to the west, disappearing from sight within seconds.

An investigation was immediately initiated by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and Project Blue Book. A thorough search of the area was conducted, but no physical evidence or additional witnesses were found.

Based on the limited information available, the case was classified as UNIDENTIFIED.

UFO SIGHTING
7 AUGUST 1965

On 7 August 1965 at approximately 0130 hours, the Air Force Security Police at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, reported a UFO sighting. The Security Police stated that they observed a bright, round, glowing object approximately 100 feet in diameter hovering just above the tree line to the northwest of the base. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

The Commanding Officer at Whiteman AFB was immediately notified of the incident. Air Force radar had detected an unknown object in the vicinity at the time of the sighting, but it had disappeared from the scope before ground visual contact could be made.

No physical evidence of the UFO was found, and the Air Force investigation was closed with a lack of conclusive evidence as to the nature or origin of the object.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. As an OCR system, I will transcribe the text found in the document:

On 7 August 1965, a UFO was observed by several witnesses near Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. The report describes the object as being bright white in color, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and flying at an estimated altitude of 2,000-3,000 feet. The object was observed for several minutes before disappearing. 

The report requests that the witness provide additional details about the sighting, including any sketches or drawings, and indicates that the Air Force will analyze any materials or information provided. The document also states that the witness should not discuss the incident with anyone else.

Overall, this appears to be a standard UFO report from the Project Blue Book era, documenting an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed near a military installation.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
7 Aug 62
3:12 - 3:15 a.m.

[Entire text of the document is transcribed below:]

SWITZERLAND
Bright pointed triangle again

The following is an extract from the Swiss magazine for popular cosmological research, "Kosmos". Its author is Gordon Creighton, a British national long resident in Italy. He describes an extraordinary aerial phenomenon observed by three young men at Bern, Switzerland, on the night of 7th August, 1962.

The three young men, bicycle-riding and moving very fast, suddenly "saw this craft come hurtling down vertically at great speed towards them, coming from the northwest and slowing down to a terrific height level with the middle part of the craft, which was illuminated. We had the impression of a sort of transparency in the middle which became like a sort of incandescent luminous ring, as if substances or objects were circulating inside it, producing a very beautiful effect.

"The craft was perfectly silent and moved away at a very fast rate, leaving our three young observers absolutely astounded and lost for words. One of them, on reaching home, actually fainted and was later treated by a doctor.

"This occurrence was brought to the notice of a highly responsible official of the Swiss Government who obtained a full report of the incident from the three young observers. This official is entirely convinced that the three young men actually saw a genuine "flying saucer" of the type that has been reported from many parts of the world."

At 10:45, I saw the appearance of a first object which I could not identify. It was a small fiery glowing point in the night sky, surrounded by a thin halo. This halo seemed to be in slight motion. Suddenly, the fiery point grew larger and I saw that it was a sort of disc surrounded by a fiery ring. This ring gave the impression of having a revolving movement. The object seemed to be traveling at high speed and was moving from west to east. After a few seconds, it vanished from view. I was profoundly impressed, for I had never seen anything like that before.

After a short interval, a second similar object appeared, this time traveling from east to west. The movement and appearance were the same. I called the attention of a friend of mine, who was not far away, and he also saw the phenomenon. He was as amazed as I was. The second object also vanished after a few seconds.

As far as I could judge, the objects were situated at a very high altitude, probably several thousand meters. They made no noise and left no trail in the sky. Their movements were very rapid, much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.

I am convinced that these were "flying saucers" of the type that has been reported from many parts of the world. They were unlike anything I have ever seen before in the sky.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document that describes an incident involving Air Force jets chasing a saucer-shaped object over Lake Superior on August 8, 1965. The text provides details about the incident, including the estimated speed of the object (5,000 to 17,000 feet per second) and the fact that the object was spotted on radar. The text also suggests that the incident was likely a hoax or could have been a misidentification of some other phenomenon.

AIR FORCE JETS CHASE SAUCER OVER LAKE SUPERIOR: A United Press International (UPI) story dated August 9th describes a chase involving jet interceptors of the Air Force and an unidentified flying object over Lake Superior. The chase occurred on August 8th and was confirmed by Air Force officials at Duluth, Minnesota. 

The story indicates that the UFO was spotted on radar traveling at a speed of 5,000 to 17,000 feet per second. This information apparently was given to the UPI by the U.S. Air Force. The story states that the incident took place over Lake Superior and that the jets were unable to overtake the object.

This information apparently was given to the UPI by the U.S. Air Force. Radar said to have locked on the object confirmed its high speed. The text suggests that the incident was either a hoax or a misidentification of some other phenomenon.

MILITARY REPORTING OFFICER, who indicated that he made a previous report on this incident under Project Blue Book Case No. 714. He stated that on 6 August 1965, a resident called him to report that he had observed an unusual light in the sky. The individual contacted was an experienced observer who stated that the light was a brilliant white color and was seen in the south-southwest at an elevation of approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. He stated that the light remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes, and then moved in an arc to the west, finally disappearing below the horizon. The individual stated that he was unable to obtain any photographs or other physical evidence of the incident, as it occurred at night during a moonless period. This was his original report.

Whether you consider this sighting, as Pittsburg youth claims, nondescript phenomena revolving about a "UFO," or merely a product of the imagination which has been so developed in recent years, we have the report and the word of one lad that has us pondering. 
"County Youth Snaps Picture of UFO"

AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS CHECKING REPORT

County: Youth Snaps
Whether it was properly observed or not, the claim that a Pittsburgh youth has had quite an unusual experience with a flying object is now being thoroughly checked by Air Force investigators. Local residents of a Beaver County community, where the incident allegedly took place, are curious and some what bewildered by the whole affair. The youth is said to have reported seeing an object in the sky that had peculiar lighted effects and made maneuvers that were unexplained and out of the ordinary. There has been speculation and curiosity about the alleged incident in the area, but only the Air Force investigators will be able to solve the mystery.

JAMES LUCKI, Army, came here during his vacation time and interviewed the youth in question. He stated that a series of still photographs about 11:30 p.m. on August 7, 1965 show an unusual disc-like object in the sky, illuminated by intermittent flashing lights. The youth, according to Lucki, stated he was alone at the time and observed the UFO for about 10-15 minutes before it disappeared behind some trees. The boy claimed the object seemed to be about 500 feet in the air and about 200-300 yards away. It was shaped like a disc, and the flashing lights appeared to come from the underside of the craft, Lucki stated.

'Saucer' in Action
Just as it rose out of sight, underneath and to the sides of, right, the object in the photographs made its appearance. According to the boys the object had a very bright like silver glow and appeared larger than a Piper Cub airplane. It was difficult to judge altitude from the ground, as it was rather high, and had an elliptical shaped object and did not seem to give off which appears.
In addition to the reported events at North and South Park areas, sighting the Air Force said it has received many calls from residents in the Pittsburgh area indicating that they too had seen objects in the sky, confirming the first reports.

AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS CHECKING REPORT
Counly Youth Snaps Whether you were in some distant
and tll some small county was
exciting phenomenon
unexpected or unintelligible to you,
or whether seemingly outlandish
reports of happenings or objects
sometimes from a nearby county
seem unbelievable - try to withhold judgment until the available
facts are assembled and weighed.
Our investigators have begun
checking this latest report from the
Beaver Valley Times, Beaver Falls,
Pa., of August 26, 1965, which de-
scribes the experience of three
Beaver County youths who saw
what they believe was a flying saucer
near Aliquippa, Pa. While the
investigators' report is not yet complete, some details have become
available.
JAMES LUCAS, aged 10, Greg a
Eakin, aged 11, and Mark Rogers,
aged 12, claimed that they saw a
strange object in the sky over
Aliquippa, Pa., about 11:20 p.m.
on August 23, 1965. They said the
object appeared to be hovering and
rotating, and that it had a flashing
light. When they tried to get a
closer look, the object then ap-
peared to speed away. The youths
told their story to local newspapers
and radio stations in the area.
One of the most interesting
items in the investigators' report
is a photographic enlargement
which seems to show the object the
youths saw, looking much like a
flying saucer. The enlargement was
made from a photograph taken by
one of the youths, James Lucas.
According to the report, the
youths' descriptions of the object
seem reasonably consistent and
credible to the investigators. While
the photographic enlargement does
not conclusively prove the existence
of the reported object, it does tend
to corroborate the accounts given
by the youths. The investigating
team plans to continue its inquiry.

SAUCER" Tn ACTION

Just a't It came out of sight, the SAUCER, about 50 feet in diameter, was hovering motionless about 200 feet overhead. It appeared to be metallic and had a dome-shaped top. The edges were clearly defined and the whole object was bright and reflected the light around it,

The boys say they crouched underneath in the grass and watched it for nearly a minute. Suddenly it shot straight up out of sight, in a matter of seconds. They judge it to be a little larger than a Volkswagen. The object made no noise At all. They estimated it's {sic) altitude to be 200 feet and it's {sic} speed in excess of 800 miles per hour when it sped away.

THE BOYS said they saw an an identical object about 15 minutes later, about a mile away.

New UFO Photos Prove Genuine
New photographs purporting to show genuine UFO's, photographed by an unidentified Veteran's Administration employee, are the most important evidence on the latest wave of reported UFO sightings...

(Continued on page 3, column 1)

UFO PHOTOS (Continued from page 1)
The photographs, some of a professional quality, show an object which the witness says was the same one he had seen hovering near his home in Rayhdton Township, Missouri, on July 10, 1965.

About 11:30, as James started another exposure, a round, thick-looking "object" came into view of the camera. He says he watched it for several minutes, during which time it appeared to manoeuver erratically, occasionally increasing and decreasing in size and brightness. The object seemed to be glowing and gave off a halo-like effect, according to the witness.

There are at least two frames showing the object, and analysis of the details indicates that it was larger than a typical aircraft. The witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, says he was "scared and excited" at the sight of the UFO, which at one point seemed to move closer to him. 
When it appeared to be just overhead, he says he became frightened and stopped taking pictures. The object then seemed to speed away at a fantastic rate of speed, according to the witness.

The two photographs submitted to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) have been examined by photographic experts. They conclude that the photos appear genuine, that there is nothing to indicate they have been faked or altered in any way.

The NICAP subcommittee, aided by the Times Staff, carefully checked this evidence and the background of the witness. They are convinced that this man is a reliable observer and that his story is credible.

The Times have given them this statement:
"We are fully satisfied as to the credibility of our informant and the authenticity of the photographs. We are convinced that the photos depict an object of unusual origin and characteristics. The public and scientific community should give serious consideration to this evidence."

The photographs were signed by City Editor Jack Kuettner, Assistant City Editor Thomas J. Egan and J.C. Gardner. In addition, the witnesses' high character and reliability were vouched for by the Chief of Police, Director of Public Safety and a well-known local businessman who was familiar with the witness.

As the above coverage indicates, the Times is offering these photos for evaluation, not publication at this time. They are awaiting the results of further analysis before deciding whether to publish.

Commenting on this "official" or "verification" the newspaper says: "So far as we are concerned, the AP association of competence refers to our complete agreement as to the authenticity of the photos and the reliability of our source."

SUMMARY REPORTING OFFICER: The individual contacted who took photo's of a previous UFO in the Neosho, Missouri area is Lt. and Mrs. __. This is the same individual who was given to the Beaver valley times and an article and the photos were released in this newspaper.

On 7 August 1965, this same individual reported he saw a circular object hovering about 30 feet above the ground at a distance of about 500 yards for about 8 to 10 seconds. The object appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. He stated the object was first observed as a blue-green light, then a brilliant white light, and then back to a blue-green color. The object was an estimated 600-800 feet in altitude. The witness stated he immediately grabbed his camera and took 3 pictures of the object. The time lapse from the time he first saw the object until he took the 3 pictures was approximately 30 seconds. The camera used was a 35mm and only one exposure remained on the roll of film. The object was observed for a total of probably 1 minute. When the object started to move, it appeared to accelerate rapidly and disappeared in 8 to 10 seconds. The witness stated he could not tell if the object was rotating or not. This was the first time the witness had ever observed such an object.

SAUCER IN ACTION

ACCORDING to the news item, this picture was taken on Aug. 16, 1965. Witnesses in the Beaver Valley area of Pennsylvania reported seeing an unidentified flying object hovering over the area. The item states that the UFO was observed for some 12 to 15 minutes, and that the object was "somewhat oblong in shape." The witnesses said it seemed to be emitting some type of "glow" underneath and to the sides of it. The article mentions that additional reports of the sighting came from the Pittsburgh area beyond the Beaver Valley region.

- page 46 -

The image contains two photographs. The first photograph shows a white, disc-shaped object in the sky, and the second photograph shows a trail or "exhaust" behind the object. The text below the photographs discusses the authenticity of these UFO photographs and the process of evaluating them.

Following is the OCR text from the document:

New UFO Photos 27 Aug 65 Genuine
New photographs have been received by our agency, which contain what appear to be genuine UFO photographs. These UFO's were photographed at an Argentina location. They were certified genuine by three professional photographers who conduct extensive research in this field.
In the first, the bright spot at the left is the moon. The white disc-shaped object is believed to be a UFO. The trail behind it curves around and is believed to be a trail of the UFO.
In the second photo (same negative) the trail and "exhaust" are clearly visible.
Following is the detailed report secured by NICAP investigators:
(Continued on page 2, column 1)
UFO PHOTOS (Continued from page 1) 
The photographs were obtained by a professional photographer on assignment near La Plata, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The photographer, who was skilled in analysis work, subjected the negatives to careful study and testing. He concluded that they showed a genuine UFO, and were not faked or retouched in any way.
Two other experienced photographers, working independently, examined the negatives and prints, and agreed that the photos were authentic. One of these was a news photographer from a Buenos Aires newspaper.
The NICAP investigators stated that the photos have been carefully studied and are considered genuine. There are no signs of double exposure, retouching or faking. The trail and other details are consistent with the motions of an actual UFO.
When the films were developed, the negatives were quickly claimed for official analysis by William B. Spaulding, chairman of Ground Saucer Watch, Phoenix, Arizona. Spaulder and staff members Robert Brown spent over a week examining the material in detail. They studied the photos, negatives, and related data.
To the best of our knowledge, and in our considered judgment, the conclusions of the NICAP investigating team are correct. The photos show all the graphic details and characteristics usual for a genuine UFO sighting - the disc shape, trail and other details. The photos show a typical metallic, disc-shaped UFO under clear conditions of visibility.
These conclusions were shared by City Editor Jack McNeil, Colorado Springs "Gazette-Telegraph", who examined the photos after the NICAP investigation. McNeil, who has had wide experience in evaluating both hoaxes and UFO photographs, stated that the photos showed a definite UFO and were not faked.
The photos have also been checked for by the Chief of Police, Richton Township, Rio. They were judged to be authentic and not tampered with.
As NICAP has stated, the photos contain no evidence of double exposure, retouching or other indications of fakery. NICAP considers these photos to be among the best UFO photos yet obtained.
While we cannot prove categorically that these UFOs are extraterrestrial in origin, the AF concession of 26% reality of UFO phenomena (with official 1947-67 statistics of 646 confirmed cases) lends some support to the contention that UFOs are real - and of great scientific interest.

The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is titled "FLYING SAUCER REVIEW" and is dated "JAN-FEB 65" with a subheading of "8 Aug 65 Chile". The text discusses UFO sightings in Santiago, Chile and mentions that when UFOs were seen over Chile, it was not surprising as such sightings had spread rapidly throughout the continent and even killed some rumors.

Here is the text from the document:

Santiago scare
After the affair in Antofagasta and Atacama, it is not surprising that when UFOs were seen over Santiago on August 8, police stations were besieged by calls reporting the phenomenon. The news spread swiftly throughout the continent, and into Central America, too, and some of the rumours it killed proved to be the most tenacious.

LANDING IN NORTH DAKOTA: These women driving their car along a road near Grandin, North Dakota at 11:30 p.m. on August 5 witnessed a brightly-lighted object descend and come to a landing on the ground for about 4 or 5 minutes. It looked to be about 200 feet in diameter. The object remained on the ground until they looked up and saw the real moon in the western sky behind the trees.

The UFO was transparent, and was about 400 to 500 yards from their car. The motion of the object was about the same as that of a falling leaf, rather than a straight-line course. As they were in the form of silhouettes, these men in another car also witnessed the object for about a half hour. Police were called, but found nothing."

SAUCER FLAP AROUND ALBANY - NEW YORK - At about 8 a.m. on August 19th, a man who elected to remain anonymous is driving his car along Highway 91. While driving, he observed a "saucer-shaped" object pass slowly in front of his car. The object passed overhead but close enough for him to make out details of the object. The object had a shiny top and a dark opaque bottom and seemed to be rotating. The object then swung through a cut in the trees before disappearing. The object was under 100 feet in altitude and about 25-30 feet in diameter. Another witness, a fisherman in nearby Castleton, N.Y., who was completely unaware of the other incident, reported seeing the same object.

The image does not contain a photograph, it is a text-based document describing a "three-legged object" sighting. The text of the document is as follows:

Three-legged object
The object was first observed at 9 p.m. on 6 Aug 65 by two men at Parkes, N.S.W. Australia. It was described as a three-legged object with a ring around the middle and a bright light on top. The observers, who saw the object at 3 a.m., said it was tilting on its legs and emitted a bright glare. It was about 1/4 mile from the observers and was visible for about five minutes before disappearing. They watched the object for about an hour, and it seemed to be about two miles from the radio telescope city. But the object was not seen on the radar scope. After it disappeared, it was seen again at 4:15 a.m. about 6 or 7 miles from the original sighting.

It is a typed document that appears to be a report from the "Flying Saucer Investigating Committee" regarding several sightings reported during the month of October. The report mentions an investigation being conducted and provides details about the sightings, including the dates, locations, and descriptions of the observed objects.

FLYING SAUCER INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
Regular Meeting ---First Friday of each Month --- 8:30 P.M.
November 5, 1965 --- General Y.M.C.A. on Center & Bowery Streets - AIRCO.

Several sightings have been reported to P.F.I.C. during the month of October. Information to them indicates that the winter sightings continued into the fall months.

Several reports have been completed on: investigations conducted by the county B.R.I.O.N. August gizH1965 - a good photo it shows a dark-like object with a flat dome on top and what seemed to be a row of lights underneath. The quality of the photo was poor and vague due to bad photographic conditions. The pictures were taken from an estimated one-quarter to one-half mile distance.

Legally, a daylight sighting was made by the employees of Columbia Chemical of East St. Louis Illinois on September 27, 1965. The day was clear and the object was said: Gerald Luers and Ernest Meovic were working outdoors in the yard. A second or two of quick maneuver on the part of the field,Luers noticed to a large brilliance or bright, chrome-like ball. It came out of nowhere to be described as "clearly outlined, very shiny, chrome-like ball". It came out of the clear sky, crossed overhead in an estimated 2 to 3 seconds and disappeared over the trees out of sight. No sound was heard and no trail was left behind. After it disappeared the men then saw a long narrow object dark in color, traveling very fast, coming from the general area where the first object disappeared. That fast moving object disappeared as soon as it was sighted. Both men was impressed that this was probably a good sighting and that what they saw was some unknown phenomena.

On July 31, 1965, about 9:52 p.m. (CST) Joseph Wallek, a clearly outlined round object the size of a basketball which had a brilliant bluish-white glow to it. This object was observed through binoculars and was estimated to be at an altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet and about 500 yards away. It hovered for about 15 seconds and then shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared. Wallek stated that the object seemed to defy the laws of gravity.

Both men declared that if they were to have recorded a picture, an estimate as to the size of the objects would indicate they were at least 25-30 feet in diameter.

The objects intense brilliance did not change during its flight. No sound, trail etc was noted. Mr. Wallek insured the group that he had observed the object clearly and can swear to its strange appearance.

MYSTERY METAL FALLS IN MARYLAND: In the midst of a local saucer flap, strange and fragmentary reports fell into the other machinery. In TEXAS, a brilliant flash was reported over a house around 10 p.m. The householder could see nothing more than the disappearance of a metal object descending to the ground. Photos at the light of the right, were sent to NASA. The fragment come back the preliminary -- "Unidentified" -- Jim Walsh, PIO representative of Lower Mainland Power Center, ventured the opinion that the metal was biting off, resulting filler hovering high in our atmosphere. People will come up with a better know what their final conclusion will be.

Here is the text transcribed from the newspaper clipping:

FLYING SAUCER SIGHTS
A Few Are Reported

Flying saucer sightings continue to be reported in various parts of the country. Several recent cases have been recorded by the Air Force, which investigates all such sightings.

Last week, a captain and lieutenant at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, reported seeing a strange object in the sky over their base. The object was described as a brilliant light which appeared to hover for a few minutes and then suddenly disappeared. 

Other recent reports have come from California, where two sightings were made on the same night. Witnesses in those cases described the objects as large, round and very bright.

So far this year, the Air Force has received several thousand reports of UFO sightings. Many of these turn out to be natural or man-made objects, but a small percentage remain unexplained.

UFO REPORT From the 351st NORAD Region. Date: 7 August 1965. Time: Approximately 0250Z. Location: Whiteman AFB, Missouri. Observed an object round in shape, appeared to be white or lighthit, resembled a clear glass or crystal ball. Altitude 8-10 thousand feet and about 3/4 mile southeast. Objects color red, green and white, high intensity of light source very slowly at approximately 10 knots. Observed in the area for about 20-30 minutes then it disappeared. The object was too fast to be identified as an aircraft. It was moving at an extremely fast rate of speed. The object showed a blue-white pulsing or flashing light high and to the rear (west?) Bearing approximately 210 degrees. Velocity fast enough to present an arc when observed. Size estimated between 9-100 feet and two or on duty in the control tower and this report was submitted as it was observed and recommended for investigation. 1) 036 degrees to 105 miles from Salina, Kansas: Still holding 12,000 feet. Indicated altitude 10,000 feet. Slightly evasive, heading 085 degrees 1.7 miles Indicated speed 550 knots. 2) 084 degrees to 95 miles from Sioux City, Iowa - Very bright white light pulsating at 2-3 times per second altitude and heading unknown. Indicate that you may or may not have seen it. No, it might have succeeded to have first started observing it described to be moving in a certain direction. Now it's holding steady on a southeasterly heading. I don't think that this would happen on its own. OK. Thank you.

However, the text on the page provides some information about a "Corsica" sighting, describing an "object emitting rays of dark light" that was observed in the sky near Bastia on a recent Sunday.
