Here is the text output from the document:

Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

In regard to the objects seen on the night of August 12, here are my comments:
These objects were moving rapidly high in the sky, appeared to be disc shaped and estimated their size from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and assuming the objects were not in that outer layer of atmosphere, they appeared to be traveling at a tremendous speed, probably from 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour.

Where the objects disappeared: 
1. Overhead 
2. Westward
3. Lateral astronomy   (I have no surface to reflect.)
4. A blinding light

I have a commercial photo; I used with instrument sound movie-Cyclops Rotors. My home address is redacted. I have seen many others and it was off. These lights. My home is elevated on this location, and I can assure you I am familiar with seeing from over my head at all hours, moving at 0300 at about 400 mph. They make enough noise to take off the roof, and two lights couldn't I stand requested to the navigation lights.) were harmless
