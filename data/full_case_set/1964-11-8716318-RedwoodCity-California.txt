1. The enclosed UFO sighting was reported to the Mill Valley Radar Site (ADC) as the enclosed letter indicates. However, by the time the information reached this office, it was too late for an on-the-site investigation.

2. This same phenomenon was seen by several other persons. Since these reports coincide with the enclosed information, statements were obtained.

3. The person who supplied the report and the color slide is a private individual.

4. Probable identity of this object has not been determined. As far as can be determined, there were no known aircraft, balloons or missiles in the area at the time of the sighting.

The text in the document reads:

The duration of this sighting was around 3-5 minutes on a little less. The diameter was a little variable between 40-50 ft. There was a hoverlike motion up and down with no visible means of propulsion. It was variable in color - first it was a brilliant white, then a dull reddish color. It disappeared with no noticeable trail. It was quite low - estimated under 1000 ft. - and at one time was close enough that I could see the contours and shape clearly although the body remained featureless. I will say that the experiment was utterly unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky before, and I feel quite convinced that it was not of this earth. I could not begin to guess what it was, but it was not an airplane, satellite, balloon, or any conventional device that I am familiar with. Every characteristic was unearthly. I have no idea as to the purpose or origin of the object, but it was most decidedly not of this world.

Lieutenant William: "Yesterday afternoon, at about 3:45 on the 5th, my eye was attracted by a shiny object in the sky which appeared to be a large balloon. It was round, flat on both sides, and appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter. It was traveling at an extremely high speed - much faster than any jet aircraft. I watched it for several minutes as it traveled towards the southwest. At first it appeared to be descending, but then it picked up speed and climbed to a higher altitude. It was silvery-white in color and appeared to be metallic in nature. The object gave off no exhaust or vapor trail, and made no sound that I could hear. After traveling for about 5 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. I have included a rough sketch of what I observed, but it does not do justice to the actual object."

Wayne walde,

I was speaking to your wife, she is a bit shaky as I was told she was quite upset when you called earlier to tell her a strange flying object has been sighted around Berkeley. I am really very sorry to tell you, there has been a tragic accident and your son David was killed in the accident.

The police officer called me a short while ago to give me the details. Apparently there was some kind of malfunction with the car and it went out of control and crashed. Your son was killed instantly. I know this must be a terrible shock and I am so very sorry. I wish I had better news for you. 

I have contacted the authorities and arrangements are being made to have David's body brought home. Someone will be in touch with you regarding the funeral arrangements. My deepest condolences to you and your wife during this difficult time. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Sincerely,
Edith H.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

On the morning of 8 Nov 1964 I saw a professional photographer who was in the group of the people experienced in meeting. The man I have seen was about 5'8" tall, thin, with reddish brown hair, mid 40s, dressed conservatively (dark suit, white shirt, tie, etc.) and carrying a small camera (probably 35mm). I told him the details of my sighting, but he seemed neither impressed nor surprised. I hope that my signing this report will not be damaging in any way to my future. I would not like to be damaged in the world of science. Sincerely yours,

UFO Report

Mr. [Redacted]

1. I tried to call you several times today but was unable to make contact.

2. So that the Air Force can better evaluate your report or sighting an UFO, I would appreciate if you would provide the following information below:

a. Place, time and date of sighting.
b. Approximately how long the object was in sight.
c. Since a camera was used it will be necessary for you to make duplicates of the negatives. They would appreciate it if you would send them the film developed or not, and also the following information:
(1) Type camera used
(2) Type and make of lens
(3) Focal length of lens
(4) Shutter speed
(5) Aperture
(6) Brand and type of film

3. Any further reportings should be made directly to Base Operations at Redwood City. They are better equipped and can handle sightings much faster.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]

DEAR MR. ------ :

This is in reply to your observation of an unidentified flying object on 16 November 1964 and the photograph taken of this object.

The analysis and microscopic study of the film indicate that it is a hoax. The photograph was enlarged for your use.

The conclusions of the study after photo analysis are as follows: (1) No true photographic image could be discerned. (2) The exposure time was extremely brief, preventing any clear image from being recorded. (3) If the object depicted in the photograph had been a true physical object, there would have been evidence of a constant density across the apparent image. (4) The density of the image as disclosed by the photomicrography indicates it was produced by optical distortions in a manner consistent with a hoax. The photograph was taken after dark which could indicate intentional exposure designed to conceal its artificial nature, without your knowledge.

From the data presented in your report, we are unable to make a positive identification of this object. For the object was not directly observed by trained personnel, the details of the sighting are incomplete. This indicates an object of tremendous size since the distance to the object is unknown. Details of the location and motion are not included. There were two particular temperature variations recorded during the observation, but these data were not sufficient to draw any identifiable conclusions.

An analysis in the report indicates an azimuth of 20 degrees and an elevation of 30 degrees at the time of the major astronomical disappearance. No major astronomical object was recorded in this position at that time.

Major valley, this is something very interesting. The whole object was small, two oblong things, one above the other were about the size of this (sketch). They were in the sky and at an angle like this (sketch). When looked at, they were of short duration, like those (sketch). That's about all I could see, as my attention was attracted to the object only momentarily. I did not make any notes nor any measurements, as I couldn't do so very well. Please let me know if you would like any more information about it.

OFFICIAL FILE COPY
UFO Sighting and Photo, Redwood City, California, 2 Nov 64 - 5 Jan 65
HQ USAF SAPOT PD (Mrs Hunt) 
MAIL C-C-C-C
This office is in receipt of a UFO report from the resident of Redwood City, California. The following is a suggested reply:

Dear Mr.
This is in reply to your observation of an unidentified flying object on the night of 2 November 1964 and the photograph taken of this object.
Completed analysis of the 35 mm film has been accomplished by a photo interpreter and a technical report is attached to a photocopy of your original letter.
The conclusions of the study of the photo analysis are as follows:
(1) No sharp photographic definition of the object could be determined on the chip. (2) The visible image could be a small film flaw or a duplicated flaw or chip in the gelatinous coating. (3) The conclusions reached after film analysis was that its size is uncertain.
This indicates an object of tremendous size while the remaining analysis dimensions indicated a much smaller object. The variations in temperature inversions in the area, one at 420 ft and the other at 600 ft, could account for these apparent discrepancies.
From the data presented, we are unable to make a positive identification of the object which you observed. The size of the object was certainly significant if the film chip size estimation is valid. 
This office appreciates your reporting this observation to our program and we value your interest and cooperation in this matter.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing text only.

TEXT OUTPUT:

250 ft- The position of the object was given as 20 degrees elevation, 350 degrees azimuth, disappearance was listed on the same heading but no reliable information was reported. No under investigation object.

We had hoped that the photograph would reveal an identifiable image. However, photo analysis revealed that the image on the print is not the same as the object observed by you.

The evaluation information is desirable for analysis of the visual observation: (1) Local map of the area and the location (direction and distance) of the object in relation to a point of reference, and bearing and elevation of the object in flight in relation to the motion of your car and the direction and elevation of the horizon, (2) any information pertaining to the description of the object in changes, in size, shape, and color.

If there is a delay in asking for this information and hope that some additional data can assist in further identification of the image.

The Air Force wishes to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in unidentified flying objects and your reported observation.

YOU WILL CONSIDER

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 6-64
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: Redwood City, California
PHOTOGRAPHY: One 35mm color slide provided by USEW
QUALITY: Poor
PURPOSE: This report answers work order #64-120 submitted by Major Quintanilla USEW. The request forwarded a photo and color slide of a purported unidentified flying object.
ANALYSIS: Microscopic study of the attached 35mm slide by the photo analysts and photo processing personnel revealed the following conclusions:
a. No true photographic image is visible on the chip.
b. The visible image could be film flaw or a duplicated flaw or chip in the emulsion.
c. The constant density from film edge to film edge could indicate that the image was not exposed in a camera, but rather had been exposed.
