Here is the full text extracted from the document:

PBT NO.:
COMPANY, Akron. Inquired if any power line trouble had occurred in the area of Nemith Lake on 21-22 Jan 61. None was recorded, and if any trouble had occurred, Mr. Nemith should have been notified. It was confirmed that there was no trouble of any kind. Also from the reported behavior and location of the UFO it could be deduced that it should have caused power line trouble which was not reported.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
Conducted a personal interview with Mr. and recorded the incident.
Conducted a complete photo-reconnaissance of the area in which the incident of 21 January occurred.
Established a friendly working relationship with Mr. , Director of the UFO Research Committee, Akron.
Established working support of Akron Civilian Defense Office, Mrs. .
Became area orientated in case future incidents dictate repeated trips.

PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS:
All people contacted were very eager to cooperate and gave freely of their time.
Relating their stories, they appeared with the incident and contacted gave very little false information - all were very sincere and from many personal debriefing experiences.
I feel, whatever his motivations, is in very eager and capable of honestly and unbiasly assisting in UFO investigations.
Local Akron Civilian Defense Offices can and should be utilized while conducting UFO investigations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Utilize local area Civilian Defense Organizations during UFO investigations. Utilize various Civilian UFO Organizations (However, make it understood that the organizations do not represent the USAF during organizational activities).
Conduct on the spot taped interviews plus photo reconnaissance.
Perform finished studies of each factually backed up incident.
Perform a study of compounded background UFO reports.

Reminiscation to the various UFO organizations could be accomplished by utilizing special which as the evidence from the organization as evidence.

ITEM V (Cont)
The family went out the family went outside during the observation of the incident. It was also stated that the daughter the daughter who is a business trip, both incidents occurred approximately 15 the same way from Akron, Ohio, Nov, 22, 1960. During the interview, Mr. showed us the location of the incident both from their sighting or observation/behavior. (Continued)

At the termination of the Interview, contact was made with Mr. of the UFO Research Committee, Akron, and an interview was established.

Mr. brought along to the interview his assistant, Mr. At first the two gentlemen were very unfriendly, due mainly to previous undue treatment directed to them due to their publicity, a great deal sensitive to the Dept of Defense.

During the 7 hours of interview Mr. shown us every consideration, took us to interview a Mrs. whose home is located in the neighborhood, and had a Mr. join us and related how he had also reported the sighting to the Committee. The committee has complied throughout the processing the great deal of UFO work he and his assistants.

While at the home we listened and recorded taped interviews of 8 other individuals made by Mr. 10:30 p.m., Mrs. age 31, & her 11 year old daughter, and Mr. age 30 p.m. - all of whom related of their sightings. NORAD did not report their sightings of a UFO officially except to Mr. who has had interviews with them recorded on tape.

During our interview with bought out the very irritating fact of the great amount of trouble he and other conscientious citizens have had dealing with various government officials, especially with the Dept. of Defense. Their attitude, he claimed, is unacceptable and ridiculous, and indicated that this official has treated him with childish discontent. 

We also had an interview with Akron's Civilian Defense Office. She was very cooperative and has offered to us (USAF representatives) the use of any/all of the city's services at any time even the use of her offices as our headquarters in the future should need arise.

Transcribing the text found in the document:

"Nesmith Lake Police Attitude on 'Flying Object' Rejected By Council

The council concerned tonight in UFO Action aries' reply was in the negative area of unidentified flying objects. 
The Council gave official attitude that any member of the public who reports an unidentified flying object should not be ridiculed or accused of being 'imaginative.'

It was pointed out that there is wide public interest in these phenomena which should be treated with fairness and without prejudice.

Council members referred to a recent case in the Nesmith Lake area in which local police were criticized for their attitude toward a report of an unidentified flying object.

That matter will be investigated further, the Council said.

Saucer Laws Needed
The UFO Action aries suggested that any citizen who wishes to complain about the treatment which Akron families received in the Nesmith Lake report on an unidentified flying object be permitted to make a report to the Council.

The flying saucer group says somebody at the police station received the report and then 'laughed it off' in a derogatory manner. The letter asks Council to uphold the rights of citizens to report such observations without fear of ridicule.

The Council's first reaction was to wonder if the Police Department staff had been fair in their treatment of the citizens making the report. Instead of taking the matter to Council, the listeners were told to take UFO reports seriously is only part of what is involved here.

Seeming to conduct of officers who may have scoffed at the report and the public made the Nesmith Lake report seriously. The Council stated it will investigate this matter further, and indicated it was not just in being polite to the public but in making official policy on the handling of such reports.

The Council also indicated it would consider any safeguards or laws needed to protect citizens from unnecessary ridicule or other improper treatment when making UFO reports in the Nesmith Lake area.

The Council resolved to look into the matter further."

ASK ACTIVITY REPORT (Page )

ITEM 9 (CONT) - We believe that by utilizing the civilian UFO organizations two things can be readily realized:

1. Obtain any/all available information that may contribute to the solutions of UFO reports via the most economical means available to responsible USAF/ATC departments.
2. Realize a very amicable and cooperative relationship between officers of the DOD and the American Public which during the past years has become increasingly more antagonistic in many areas to include congressional interest.

Akron Ohio
21 January 1961

On 21 Jan 61, several witnesses in the Akron, Ohio area reported seeing an unidentified flying object. The information from the witnesses was generally consistent. She objects were first observed at 2250 and 2300; appearing at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The objects were further described by the witnesses as appearing as a circle or disc with the ratio of diameter to height as approximately 10 to 1.

On 21 Jan 61, the official monument at Akron was 2304. This time, of course, will be the approximate time of the sighting, as the position of the observer. However these deviations will be small. The moon was approaching first quarter and was illuminated.

When the moon is just rising or setting, it often assumes an elliptical shape with the longer diameter parallel to the horizon. This is caused by atmospheric refraction, modifying the true shape. There is for apparently no luminosity associated with the bodies; there were no layers of discontinuity in the atmosphere, the distortion will be even more marked. The distortion involved is not the direct result of the moon but is caused by the refraction. This is probably the reason the witnesses did not recognize the object it was identified as a flat or "saucer-like" craft.

On 21 Jan 61 at 2258 the weather at Akron-Canton Airport was a 2,000 foot overcast, scattered 7/8, visibility was 7 miles, and the temperature was 38° F.

It is the Air Force conclusion that the witness object viewed by the witnesses in Akron, Ohio on 21 Jan 61 was the setting moon distorted by atmospheric refraction. This conclusion is substantiated by the facts that the moon was nearing first quarter and the approximate time of moonset with none occurring after 2305 which is only one minute after the official moonset time for Akron, Ohio on 21 January 1961.

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above the horizon. The instructions indicate that this sketch is meant to demonstrate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it.

The second sketch shows a person standing on a road, with mountains or hills in the background. This appears to be a scene depicting the location where the observer first saw the object.

The third sketch is a smaller image showing a person silhouetted against a landscape.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

"32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

CASE HISTORY
Date: 4 January 1961
Location: Akron, Ohio
NARRATIVE:
On 4 January 1961, at approximately 1845 hours, a caller phoned the Akron Police Department and reported sighting a strange, lighted object in the sky near the city. The object was described as being about the size of a small airplane and having a bluish-white light that was pulsating. Further, the caller stated the object was moving quite rapidly and making sharp, erratic maneuvers.
Police officers were dispatched to investigate the reported sighting, and they verified that an unusual object was indeed present in the sky. The officers stated the object appeared to be reflecting sunlight and was moving at a high rate of speed, altering its course sharply and suddenly.
The sighting was also reported by several other citizens in the Akron area. The object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes before it disappeared from view.
An investigation was conducted, but no conclusive explanation for the sighting could be determined. The case was subsequently forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (Akron, Ohio, 21 January 1961)

TO: SAFOI-3a (Major Coleman)

1. During March 1961 your office forwarded a tape recording to ATIC which was prepared by Mr. ____ concerning the unidentified flying objects sighting in Akron, Ohio, on the night of 21 January 1961. We have forwarded a copy of this tape to the Directorate of Information Services, ACS/Intelligence, United States Air Force except through me on 31 March 1961.

2. On 31 March 1961 two officers were dispatched from ATIC to Akron for the purpose of interviewing the individuals involved in the 21 January 1961 sighting. It was determined that the UFO sighting resulted from the misidentification of the setting sun.

3. The Air Force investigators interviewed Mr. ____ and Mr. ____ tape recordings. Mr. ____'s sighting was discounted as probable misidentification of the setting sun by Mr. ____ and Mrs. ____ and her eleven years old daughter, whose testimony was consistent: the object being sighted between 2230 and 2300, appearing as a red-orange object about the size of the horizon. The object was observed about 10 to 15 minutes, during which time the object remained stationary, the top cut off and approximately five times the diameter of the moon. The sighting was estimated to have lasted approximately fifteen minutes.

4. On 31 January 1961 at 2250 the weather at the Akron-Canton Airport was a 2000 foot overcast composed of stratocumulus clouds, the visibility was 7 miles, and the temperature was 29 degrees F. The visibility was somewhat reduced due to haze and the sighting occurred at a time when the sun was setting. The significant point is the presence of stratiform clouds which are indicative of stable conditions (inversions).

5. On 21 January 1961 official moonset at Akron was 2301. This time, of course, can deviate due to topographical conditions; however, these deviations are normally insignificant.

OCR output:

usually small. The moon was approaching its first quarter and only 23% 
of the surface visible from the earth was illuminated. The semidia meter 
on this date was 15' 36.5".

6. When a ray of light consisting of vibrations of the same wave length 
(monochromatic) passes through a transparent medium such as water or
glass, it will be bent into two rays or beams. When the ray passes from a 
rarer medium, like air, to a denser medium, like glass or water, the angle
of refraction is different from the angle of incidence. Under these con-
ditions, the shorter the wave length the greater the angle of refraction. 
This causes the violet and blue components of white light to be refracted 
differently under the same conditions, the shorter the wave length the 
greater the angle of refraction. As the blue light is refracted more than
the red, the object viewed through the medium will show fringes of blue
and red light and so on. This "dispersion" (separation) of white light into
its component colors is the basis for the rainbow. This decomposition of 
a ray of white light into its constituent colors is called "dispersion". 
This dispersion of a ray of light into its constituent colors is called
diffraction. The immediate consequences of this dispersion are to occur
in a large number of layers resulting in a curved path rather than one bend as when
the one component only is refracted. As the viewer's eye changes position,
the color fringes also change in a characteristic manner.
However, on certain occasions we have an increase in temperature with at-
titude which causes the color dispersion to change more density with
altitude.

7. When the moon is just rising or setting it often assumes an elliptical
shape instead of the normal circular disc. This is caused by the
refraction raising the lower edge more than the upper and therefore
apparently shortening the diameter perpendicular to the horizon. In the
northern hemisphere this distortion appears to be greatest at the time due
to the "approach of the first quarter". Added to the effects created by the 
refraction, haze is perceptible which gradually increases until the
horizon is obscured. This is not unusual to observe, it is a normal
happening as the moonSits just above the horizon. It continues moving
higher in the sky until it assumes its normal circular shape once again.

8. It is concluded AERO that the object viewed by the witness in
Akron, Ohio, on 21 January 1961 was the setting moon distorted by atmos-
pheric conditions. The phenomena was undoubtedly caused by the same prin-
ciples of optics that affect the human eye's identification of the moon.
This conclusion is substantiated by the facts that the moon
was located just north of west on 21 January 1961, the direction reported
by the witness, and the time of the observation corresponded to the time of 
moonset with none occurring after 2305 which is only one minute after the 
official moonset time for Akron, Ohio, on 21 January 1961.

THIS IS AN UNEXPLAINED AERIAL PHENOMENON.
ON 8 JANUARY 1961, SEVERAL CITIZENS OF AKRON, OHIO REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT, METALLIC, DISC-SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE CITY.
THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND GIVING OFF A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT FROM ITS UNDERSIDE.
SEVERAL WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT MADE A LOUD HUMMING NOISE AS IT HOVERED IN THE SKY.
AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES, THE OBJECT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND SHOT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.
THIS INCIDENT WAS THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK, BUT NO EXPLANATION FOR THE SIGHTING COULD BE DETERMINED.

STATEMENT OF WITNESSES:
Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Ashbaugh, 1524 Laffer Ave., Akron, Ohio, reported that about 8:30 pm on January 8, 1961, they observed an object in the western sky. Mrs. Ashbaugh first noticed the object shortly after lighting a cigarette. It appeared to be gray in color and was moving in an east-west direction at a high rate of speed. The object was visible for approximately 45 seconds. It was estimated to be about 6 inches in diameter and appeared to be about 20-25 degrees above the horizon. No sound was heard. The object was observed through a window in their home.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS TECHNICAL INFORMATION PANEL
Incident Report
Type of Observation: Possible satellite
Date of Observation: 23 Dec 60
Time of Observation: 0440Z
Geographical Location: Akron, Ohio
Weather Conditions: Clear, starry sky, temperature 32F, visibility 20 miles
Reporting Individual: Mr. J. Gordon Cooper
Altitude and Direction of Object: Appeared to be at high altitude moving in a northeasterly direction.
Description of Object:
The object was observed through binoculars and appeared to be a silent, fast-moving bright light, following a straight and level course. Its brightness was estimated to be about equal to that of a first magnitude star. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared from view.
Evaluation:
This sighting is probably that of a satellite. The description of the object and its movement are characteristic of a satellite in orbit.
Recommendation:
No further investigation warranted.

STATEMENT OF LIEUT. JOHN LEPPLA

1. At approximately 1:00 AM, 8 January 1961, I was on duty in the Airborne Operations Center at the 4628th Air Defense Squadron, Akron, Ohio. During the course of my duty, I observed an unidentified target on the radar scope. The target was first detected in the northwest sector, ranging approximately 25 miles from the radar site. The target was picked up and tracked for approximately 12 minutes, during which time it traveled approximately 35 miles in a straight line from northwest to southeast.

2. The target did not appear to be a conventional aircraft, since it did not show the usual radar characteristics associated with aircraft. It was a very precise, strong return, not varying in intensity as it traveled across the scope. The speed of the target was estimated to be in excess of 1,200 mph, which is far in excess of the capabilities of any known aircraft.

3. During the time the target was under observation, the sky was clear and the winds were calm. There were no thunderstorms or other known phenomena in the area at the time which might have accounted for the radar return.

4. I am a fully qualified radar operator, with several years of experience in that capacity. In my opinion, the target I observed was not a conventional aircraft, but was an unidentified flying object of unknown origin.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a government program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States. The text of the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: FRIEND/W/69216
UFO SIGHTING (AKRON, OHIO, 21 JANUARY 1961)

1. During March 1961, your office forwarded a tape recording to ATIC which was received from a citizen of Akron, Ohio, concerning the subject of unidentified flying objects. The tape contained information indicating the object seen in Akron, Ohio, which occurred 21 January 1961. This tape was apparently forwarded to the President of the United States and also to several members of the United States Congress. The recording which was forwarded to ATIC was turned over to this office on 14 March 1961.

2. On 8 February 1961 ATIC was instructed by AFCIN to Akron for the purpose of investigating the 21 January 1961 UFO sighting. The date was selected by the investigators as being the most suitable due to atmospheric refraction.

3. The investigation revealed the following: Whose accounts of the sighting is on the tape were recorded. The sighting for Mr. and Mrs. ------ occurred around midnight on 21 January 1961. Mr. ----- and Mr. ---- were also eyewitnesses and their accounts were recorded. The information they provided appears to be consistent; the objects being sighted between 2230 and 2300, appearing as a single light or possibly multiple lights, and as large as a 50 cent piece in the sky, moving slowly with the top cut off and approximately five times the size of a star.

4. On 21 January 1961 at 2258 the weather at the Akron-Canton Airport was a 7000 foot overcast, the visibility was 7 miles, and the temperature was 17 degrees. The witnesses stated that a haze or cloud cover was present which may have distorted the sighting in some manner. The visibility conditions indicate the possibility of inversions or stable conditions (inversion). Inversions increase the range of visibility.

5. On 21 January 1961 official comment at Akron was 30%. This time, observers at Akron were cognizant of the fact that UFO photographs/conditions of the atmosphere were associated with temperature inversions. Preliminary photographic analysis indicates the possibility of evidence of temperature inversion.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I have extracted all the text from the document:

Usually small. The moon was approaching its first quarter and only 22% of the surface visible from the earth was illuminated. The semiameter on this date was 15' 13.9".

6. When a ray of light consisting of vibrations of the same wave length encounters  a surface sloping at an angle with the ray, a portion of the light is reflected from the surface and the remainder is refracted, when the ray passes from a denser to a rarer medium. This bending of the light rays is directly affected by differences in the velocities of the waves of different wave lengths. The shorter the wave length the more the ray is bent under the same conditions. The colors of the spectrum are affected by this phenomena - the rays of shorter wave lengths such as violet and blue light are more bent than the longer rays of the red end of the spectrum. If a ray of light should, therefore, be composed of waves of varying frequencies, the refracted rays would be separated into their component colors, as in a prism. This decomposition of a ray into its constituent colors is called dispersion. The number of layers resulting in a curved path rather than one band as when the light is of uniform frequency.

However, variations we have an increase in temperature with altitude, and  density of the atmosphere which causes a bending of the rays as a function of density with altitude.

7. When the moon is just rising or setting it often assumes an elliptical shape rather than the circular shape familiar to us. This is caused by the refraction of the upper and lower edges of the moon's disk by the atmosphere. The refraction is greater at the lower edge than the upper, due to the denser atmosphere near the horizon, and tends to flatten the upper portion and bulge the lower. This gives the illusion that the moon is larger when it is just rising or setting.

8. It was concluded by the investigators that the object viewed by the witnesses in Akron, Ohio, on 21 January 1961 was the settling moon distorted by atmospheric refraction. This conclusion is substantiated by the facts that the moon at this time of the morning of 21 January 1961 was in the conditions described - i.e. the illusion of an object remaining stationary to the southeast and with some occuring after 0305 which is only one minute after the moon's setting on 21 January 1961.

7. INFORMATION:
On 21 March 61, Captains Robert T. Smith and Earl J. Wolf, Jr. traveled to Akron, Ohio, in response to a reported UFO sighting.

The first task upon arrival in Akron was to locate the Pulliam Family who had reported a "disc-shaped" UFO sighting. The information was obtained by going to the city's newspaper, the Akron Beacon Journal, which specializes in the reporting of Unidentified Flying Objects.  

The newspaper issues of 26 and 31 January 61 carried articles relative to the "Pulliam Sighting of 21 Jan 61". The articles reported the reaction of city (Akron) officials relative to the report.

The family reporting the incident was identified as the Pulliam family, residing in the North age of Lake Nesmith, a very small lake in the city of Akron.

Before making contact with the Pulliam family, we inspected the whole area of Lake Nesmith. The family residence was located on the South side of Lake Nesmith, almost directly across from PPT Nr.

Established contact with the 5 on 21 March and arranged for an interview later on 21 March. The interview was tape recorded.

The interview recorded on tape and in general went along with a previous tape recording. However, one major discrepancy was that during the interview Mrs. Pulliam stated that she did not see any object or that her husband and children saw an object, as had been reported in the newspapers.

The coordinating, approval and other entries are visible at the bottom of the page.
