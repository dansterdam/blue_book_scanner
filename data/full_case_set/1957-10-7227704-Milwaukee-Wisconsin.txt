NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

15 OCTOBER 1957 
BERNARDSVILLE, NEW JERSEY

On the afternoon of 15 October 1957, Mrs. Elizabeth E. Klima, 37, was at her home when she saw a peculiar object to the northeast, over Basking Ridge. At that moment her attention was suddenly attracted by an extraordinary light phenomenon. It appeared larger than the full moon, with rays of light extending from it in all directions, and appeared to be coming right at her. It stopped and rolled down the window; no sound could be heard.

When this light phenomenon first appeared, Mrs. Klima became frightened and dived under the kitchen table, where she remained for a minute or so. Although she was only certain of this for a moment, when she inspected the site later that morning, she saw nothing unusual in the direction the object had come from. However, she says, "I am perfectly familiar with this type of experience. She adds, "It seemed to be incomparably larger and more luminous than anything I have seen before." It seemed to be able to stop and move back and forth and up and down, though it never left the general area. The light remained visible, apparently in the same place, for about 45 minutes.

After about 15 minutes the light began to diminish in size and intensity, and then seemed to go out altogether. Mrs. Klima says she became quite upset by the experience, though she does not consider herself an imaginative or nervous person. The light phenomenon did not make any sound at all. It seemed to be several miles away, though it appeared to her to be much closer. She says she is telling this story, though she does not want her name used, because she believes that anyone who sees such a thing should report it. From her description it appears that the object was observed to move in various directions at a rapid rate of speed, to stop and reverse direction, and to suddenly disappear from view. The investigator is of the opinion that this sighting is worthy of serious consideration, more so than if it had emanated from a witness not known to us. Information was obtained from Mrs. Klima's daughter (a co-witness of hers) and subsequently directly from the observer.

"THINGS" THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT

The reader will have noticed that the 1957 sighting wave in the U.S., like the Fall 1954 wave in France, has been marked by numerous reports of landings with little (if any) physical evidence to substantiate the claims. What appears to be a break of continuity since, along with similarities, the stories show differences of unexpected details that tend to confound the student of this phenomenon. We have been told that scores of such incidents have come to light, but have then been suppressed or explained away as illusion, fantasy or downright hoax by the Reverend Albert Bailey of Greenfield, Mass. on his NBC Television broadcast, on Sept. 26. Despite this repetition, such cases about the Potters.

Between 3 a.m. and 3 a.m., the Potters were awakened by a noise like a jet about to land - "but not really like it" - and looking out their bedroom window, they saw a bright light illuminating the corner of their house and then growing dimmer as it rose up over the trees, and they could see three dark figures moving around that "kept bumping up and down". The Potter was called but after watching for a while remarked "after a while, Mr. Potter shouted at the 'things' to go away, and they ran behind the trees". Shortly after this, there was a bright flash about 200 yards behind the house. From the ground at the top of the hill, a "short, stubby object" 40 feet or so in diameter, "was noted as it rose up the hill and then shot up into the sky". In the near morning the Potters found the high grass in the area flattened in a peculiar manner. Several observers told their story, and by its agreement, in all essentials with the tape of the events, it is done, made for CBS.

Mrs. Potter, describes the landing object as a half dome, with a few rows of lighted "square windows" around the lower portion which were of blinding intensity. The figures on the ground - about three or four in number - were humanoid in shape but the faces or other details cannot be ascertained. Reportedly, the bright flash afterwards may have been due to an explosion, a crash landing or perhaps a take-off. This figure must fit into the first paragraph but carefully avoid naming or identifying any individuals. Refrain from stating anything that may identify the specific individuals involved.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for September 28, 1957
SEE FALL CONSTELLATIONS
Some of the constellations are visible in the southern sky during October, which also brings an unusual solar eclipse visible from Antarctica.
BY JAMES STOKLEY
As the long nights of autumn return, we have the brilliance of stars of winter. There are many interesting and characteristic constellations to be found in the evening sky during October.
At present Venus is in Scorpio. It was, at the beginning of September, almost in the middle of the constellation. Now it has moved higher, and by the end of the month it will be near the bright star Antares, the heart of the Scorpion. Venus is by far the brightest object in the evening sky at present, some 35 times as bright as Antares, the nearest star.
The other naked-eye planets (Mercury, Mars and Jupiter) are also prominent in the evening sky during October. Mercury appears low in the west shortly after sunset, Mars is in the east, and Jupiter is in the southeast.
According to the map, we find that some of the constellations of the Zodiac are prominent. Scorpio, with Antares, can be found in the south. Libra, the Scales, is next to it, and to the east we see Ophiuchus, the Serpent-bearer. Above Scorpio is Sagittarius, the Archer, and further north is Aquila, the Eagle.
The course of the stars extending downward from the zenith shows the three prominent winter constellations - Cassiopeia, Perseus and Andromeda. Cassiopeia can be recognized by its conspicuous W-shaped figure.
The figure of Pegasus, the Winged Horse, is almost directly overhead. Beneath it is Aquarius, the Water-bearer, and to the east are the stars of Pisces, the Fishes.
This may be a good time to look for meteor showers, as the Zodiacal constellations are prominent. Prolonged observation often shows a number of "shooting stars," especially around the times of the meteor showers. These should not be confused with satellites or other artificial objects moving across the sky, which are seen quite often these nights.
CONSTELLATIONS OF THE ZODIAC
Aries, the Ram: Spring represents where the sun was about 2,000 years ago at the time of the vernal equinox. The others are Taurus, the Bull; Gemini, the Twins; Cancer, the Crab; Leo, the Lion; Virgo, the Virgin; Libra, the Scales; Scorpio, the Scorpion; Sagittarius, the Archer; Capricornus, the Sea Goat; Aquarius, the Water Bearer; and Pisces, the Fishes.

OCR Text Output:
The eclipse, however, will just cross the edge of the moon, where a British expedition is located. This expedition will observe the eclipse. The line of totality, or the region where the moon completely covers the sun, will not cross the United States. If the line of totality does not cross any part of the United States, it is not the eclipse should still be useful. This information about the ICY program was perhaps of interest of the military or other government agencies who may have been interested in observing the eclipse.
Below stated Under the letters is the caption:
Estimated Times for Contact:
On EST
3:14:21 A.M. Begin first contact
3:15:11 A.M. End of first contact
4:27:56 A.M. Begin total eclipse
4:30:38 A.M. End of total eclipse
4:32:17 A.M. Begin 2nd contact
4:32:57 A.M. End of 2nd contact

The text describes details about a solar eclipse, including the timing of the different stages of the eclipse, and notes that the line of totality would not cross the United States, but that the partial eclipse would still be observable and potentially useful for observation. The text also includes a table showing the estimated times for the different stages of the eclipse.

NG* Case Information Only*
24 October 1957 Portales, New Mexico

PORTAT-IT : On or about 17 October 1957, the witness, MRF, (aged 30) a merchant and resident of Portland, Oregon, was driving across country from his home to Portales, New Mexico, accompanied by his wife and two small children. At a point about 55 miles southwest of Midland, Texas, near the town of Crane, the witness said they observed a strange aerial phenomenon. This occurred at about 6:00 p.m. (CST) and lasted for approximately 30 minutes.

The witness said they observed what appeared to be a luminous, yellow-colored sphere, about the apparent size of a basketball, hovering and maneuvering at an extremely rapid rate of speed at an estimated altitude of from 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground. This object, he said, was under intelligent control, and appeared to be about the size of a basketball at arms length. It would suddenly accelerate and dart about, making extremely sharp turns, then slow down and hover motionless. After about 30 minutes the object climbed at a rapid rate and disappeared from view.

Other observations: The witness said the object appeared to be completely silent, and gave off a peculiar, steady glow that he described as being like the glow of neon. He said the "glass" (presumably the canopy) was rounded and almost perfectly spherical in shape. This was apparently a dome-shaped enclosure containing the propulsive equipment. The witness said the duel precision rubbing together caused a static charge. This, in turn, caused a blue glowing effect, and the object was apparently powered by an unknown propulsive force. The witness further stated the object was observed in various areas along the road between Midland and Portales, New Mexico. 

Other details: Witnesses' names withheld by request. No. Case came to be known in most unusual manner. Some time ago it the cracked windshield of the 1957 Buick driven by the witness was badly damaged, apparently from some force or substance impacting upon it from the exterior. Approximately one week later this damage was discovered to have healed itself, leaving only a barely visible, very fine hairline crack. This, the witness stated, is another example of the mysterious, unexplained properties associated with the object observed.

This case appears to be of considerable interest. The report is detailed and specific, the witness appears to be credible, and the case came to official attention in a most unusual manner, as mentioned above. Further investigation would be desirable.

GOSSAMER FALL HERALDS SAUCER WAVE

In view of the good evidence in the preceding item that "gossamer" may properly be identified with the small, silvery discs which again occurred in the vicinity of New Mexico, on October 27-28, 1957. Levelland, Texas, the scene of UFO landings ten days earlier only confirms the identification aspect. The sequence of phenomena leading up to the October 27-28, 1951 was likewise ushered in by "angel's-hair falls." Our source for the details is the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

The cobweby strands, apparently falling from a great height" and up to 50 feet long, have been a recurring phenomenon coincident with the appearance of the saucer craft in incredible numbers and size. All over the world, enormous quantities of this lint-like substance have been observed as falling from the sky, some of it heavier south of here than in Portales, to all the way to Massachusetts. Ostensibly, not a soul had ever heard of "gossamer falls," and an extraordinarily detailed account of the strange phenomenon is given in the press as an uncorroborated "mystery." This "explanation" was syndicated from the country beyond the border, by those who know all the answers, as Amherst College biologists, offered the spider-web explanation tentatively, without examining the material. The Newton Investigations Committee insists that the botchy did the men in the shower due to "spiders." The only corroboration: Airmen at Cannon Air Force Base reported they found tiny spider strands.

The text describes a reported sighting of a red satellite or rocket at 22:18 on October 4, 1957, with details about the observed object's size, speed, and altitude.

Seveval Report Seeing 
Red Satellite, Rocket

The Soviet satellite and the third stage of the rocket which put it into orbit were observed by several witnesses, according to reports. The satellite, visible as a faint red star, passed over Milwaukee, Wisconsin at 22:18 on October 4. The rocket, which was bright red in color, was seen to be about one-fourth the size of the satellite and travelling at a much faster speed. The rocket was observed at an altitude of 23,000 feet for about 25 seconds. The satellite was observed for about 45 seconds at an altitude of 300 miles. Lloyd Berkner, director of research for the Associated Universities, Inc., stated that the rocket and satellite were probably visible because they were reflecting the sun's rays. The distance of the satellite by triangulation is estimated to be 1,000 miles.
