The text in the document is as follows:

Project Blue Book Information Office
Schenectady, D.C.
February 8, 1967

Dear Project Blue Book:
I received your reply for information on Unidentified Flying Objects. Don't get me wrong, I got the information but enclosed in one of your booklets there was a letter from one of your investigators stating that they had a lot of good pictures and information on the subject, but I realized no more to the investigation seems to be there is much more to this subject. Is that really so? You say there isn't, but I know there must have been some sort of window film or something in the photos that showed there was some connection to my sighting. I wanted to photograph it but I was no allowed (as I was told, they never seen any such thing), so I decided to send you a copy and you decided that there was not a serious condition, yet I'm absolutely sure that it was not true. The other chap who reported this too, some weeks ago, got the same reply, and pulsating lights. I wasn't even sure it existed but now I'm told it doesn't. The other fellow saw something, and I saw something, we couldn't make it out, seemed like something, couldn't even see clear but say something. this went much too fast, this was the third time I have seen such a thing and I think I've got to get organized and get out there more and follow up on this. Would you please send me more information. At least the world would end, so can you give me more information on what to focus it on when I see something. I would appreciate it and I'm sure others would too. Send me more information.

Sincerely Yours,
[Signature redacted]

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch includes a horizon line, a curved line, a compass rose, and instructions for the viewer on how to use the sketch to determine the height of an object above the horizon.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Proposed reply to letter from John South, 7 May 1967

Dear [Redacted],

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object. Without an exact date or comment concerning the flight characteristics, a positive identification cannot be made. Your report will be filed for information purposes only. 

The Air Force has found no tangible evidence that proves extraterrestrial vehicles exists. After investigating over 11,000 cases since 1947, there has been a total lack of evidence to substantiate the existence of extraterrestrial vehicles flying in and out of our atmosphere.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

R. J. Squireth 3/ May 67
