Dear Sir:
I waited like the spirit unset as I believe unclassified had a visit to the event site which was very close and I saw a craft with clear lights on all sides.
I will send in 120 mm photos that I took about 1:00 to 1:20 am as I saw the craft that was approximately 40-50 feet in diameter hovering about 150 feet above me for about 2-3 minutes. The craft seemed to be under intelligent control as it moved slowly and then accelerated rapidly, ascending straight upwards.
I must relate that I am not a crackpot or someone looking for publicity, but an earnest observer who believes he has seen something extraordinary. 
Please advise what action, if any, I should take regarding this incident.
Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

The observer stated that the object was bright in color, oblong in shape, and appeared to be travelling at a high rate of speed. No other details are provided in the report. The case is classified as unidentified due to the lack of supporting data."
