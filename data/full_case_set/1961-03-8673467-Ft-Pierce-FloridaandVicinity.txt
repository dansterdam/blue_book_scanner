DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
INFORMATION DIVISION
OFFICE OF INFORMATION
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

Dear Major Coleman:

Your letter dated April 7, 1961, regarding sightings of white lights rotating on aircraft has been forwarded to this office.

APPROVED anti-collision lights required for night flight on all aircraft in accordance with Civil Air Regulations 14 CFR 03.30.

Special Civil Air Regulation 26-12-57 which is scheduled to become effective 1 April 1961 requires strobe lights to be installed on certain military and civil aircraft. Operators who do not comply with the relevant specific requirements of this regulation may be subject to enforcement action.

A number of different types of lights are being evaluated by the Bureau of Aviation Agency with appropriate CAA participation and MATS is actively engaged in testing various lights systems and equipment to produce a brilliant brilliant light. This type of light and one recently developed will be installed in the near future on aircraft where appropriate.

INCIDENT REPORTS of unidentified objects are handled in accordance with system presently in use. When reports are received in the field, the number and types of lights present are noted. Maintaining a current list of aircraft with unexplained lights would be impractical and of little real value.

If I can be of additional assistance, please advise.

Sincerely,
(Original Signed by)
J. H. Cunningham
Chief, Air Carrier Operations Branch
Directorate of Flight Standards

Dear Donald:

Enclosed you will find the "UFO" dealing with the Florida problem on 29 April 1961. Do I will appreciate your acknowledgement,

On the 29th of April I took off from Dobbins Air Force Base (Georgia) in a T-33 (jet) just after noon time, as we were flying as instrument flight rules (IFR) via high altitude (45,000). We maintain this course and altitude at the request of Jacksonville Approach Control (Florida). Near Vero Beach (Florida), Vero Beach (Florida), and then continued on to Palm Beach (Florida), to make an approach and landing at Palm Beach International Airport. 

As we approached Jacksonville all control of the jet would not respond. As we were approximately 3,000 feet, the jet was approaching Jacksonville all seemed normal, the jet would not respond to my control input, (cold) approaching the rate of descent was over 4,000 feet per minute. The jet shuddered violently as if it was encountering severe turbulence or electrical disturbance. The jet continued on its assigned course, without any control inputs from me, being piloted by a force other than myself. These UFO reports to the Hq. Air Force, MacDill Air Force Base, and other agencies are numerous. It is most unusual visual sightings, Just as we were passing over Vero Beach the jet began shuddering and the AIR speed fluctuated wildly, from 280 knots down to 180 knots. This was definitely not sufficient to produce a fluctuation of any degree. The craft did not seem to respond to any of the controls. At four o'clock position to the aircraft, I looked over the aircraft and sighted a circular shaped light, metallic in appearance, about 40-50 feet in diameter, hovering about 1,000 feet above our position. It had a reddish-orange glow around the outer edge. As we passed by, the craft moved directly across our course, thereby causing turbulence and air disturbance in the cockpit. This lasted for about 3-4 minutes. After the craft had passed, the jet controls responded normally and I was able to regain control and proceed to our destination without further incident.

Nothing unusual occurred during the reminder of the leg into Myrtle Beach, Air Force Base in South Carolina. My destination was Myrtle Beach and this was a routine flight. As I approached the airfield an d began my landing approach, I saw a cluster of 5 or 6 lights in the sky; at first I thought they were aircraft, but upon closer inspection as I got nearer, I could see that they appeared to be a single craft, a spherical or disc-shaped object, emitting multiple lights. As I got closer, the object shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. I continued my normal landing and taxied to the ramp. The object had no markings, wings, or visible parts. It just appeared to be a single craft, disc-shaped, emitting multiple lights. This is the only unusual incident that occurred during the remainder of the leg into Myrtle Beach.

7 April 1961

Dear Mr. Planck:

Per telephone conversation with you on April 5th, I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 3rd concerning several sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Fort Pierce, Florida, and vicinity area on April 1st.

We have you an idea of one type of report we receive on this subject. We have you information on UFO sightings mentioned on this date from several observers and radio stations located on the lower west coast of Florida.

The information forwarded to you from Washington National office concerning my views on public statements, etc., will be appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typewritten text describing a series of UFO sightings in the Fort Pierce, Florida area.

The text is as follows:

The following is an example of UFO sightings involving multiple witnesses that was received from the Command at the Air Force Base at Fort Pierce, Florida. In the many observers, including airline and military personnel, observed an object of unusual size, shape, and color during the period the Air Force UFO investigators were on the scene. The object, which was initially a round, brilliant-white light, slowly changed colors and size during the sighting, sometimes changing colors rapidly. When the object went into clear air turbulence, it was observed to shed a small, brilliant-white light. At one point, the object was observed to split into four parts, continuing in the same general direction, before reuniting again. The object was observed for a possible explanation, it noticed that large and small fires occurred in the immediate area at about the same time, which suggest the possibility of some unusual atmospheric disturbance. It was noted, however, that this was the only indication that the object may have been related to the fires and that there was no absolute proof to tie the two together. In the opinion of the Air Force investigators, the object sightings were of sufficient significance to warrant continued investigation, and the case was coded by the Air Force as an "Unresolved" incident.

Output of the text found in the document:

You will note that according to the circular object's description, it was observed on the radar screen (circular field of view scope) for approximately 10-15 minutes (possibly longer) The object on the radar continued with various radar and visual observations until 1837 hours when it suddenly disappeared from the "object" scope at which time it was no longer able to be tracked. It appeared again at approximately 1900 hours and was then observed until about 2025 hours. The object was reported to be about the size of a small airplane and was traveling at a speed estimated to be approximately 450 knots or about 500 mph. The object emitted no sound and appeared to be at an altitude of about 20,000 feet. This information, with the attached sketch, is believed to be the total information that can be given you in this matter at this time.

It is not, as you will note, intended to be an official report, since this information is furnished to you as an interested citizen, and the attached information is helpful in this matter, is appreciated.

I would the UFO Project Officer for the Air Force (currently assigned to the Assistant Director of Intelligence) a couple of weeks ago to discuss investigation of recent military personnel at Ft. Pierce, Florida and vicinity. Their sighting a couple of weeks ago was not considered of sufficient importance for further investigation by Project Blue Book. There is a brief pilot. was flying at about 12:30 PM on ..., when his aircraft encountered sighting of an unidentified flying object near Vero Beach, Florida. He stated that the object was round, silver in color, and appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter. The pilot said that the object was traveling at a high rate of speed, and as it passed close to his aircraft, it accelerated and disappeared from sight. This, then, explains the turbulence my aircraft encountered.
