1. (UNCLASSIFIED) REPORT

2. (UNCLASSIFIED) 1/n

3. GENERAL: (1) A check with USAF RADAR/RADAR and Alaskan RADAR Region disclosed no unusual activity that could account for the sighting. In addition the possibility of reflections from Jet aircraft or ESVS that could account for the sighting in discounted because the Radar operator on duty at the time of the sighting said that the targets observed in addition to the object were not unusual and that the objects observed during the time of the sighting, plus or minus 30 minutes. The Radar operator reports nothing unusual for this period.

(2) A check with SAC/M-21050 and the AFWAG Liaison Officer revealed that on 31/3/62 a flight was made in the Mackenzie Buy area between 35/34 and 37/36 GMT. No unusual activity was observed.

4. COMMENT: We can't identify the object. It appears to have been a brilliant white light or a classified test. Due to the high elevation of the object, any classified test of a new aerial vehicle is believed more likely.

5. (UNCLASSIFIED) This report is classified [REDACTED] because it reveals some classified operational capa- bilities.

There is a photograph present in this image. It appears to be a star chart or map showing the positions of various constellations and stars in the night sky. The image includes labels for different stars and constellations, as well as symbols representing various celestial objects.

Springtime Stars Appear
With the arrival of March, new groups of stars typical of the spring season appear in the night sky. These constellations are moving westward and are becoming more prominent. During the early part of March the Jewel Box is prominent in the southwestern sky, almost at the meridian. The star Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens, is low in the southwest. Moving northward, the star Betelgeuse can be seen, part of the constellation Orion. As the evening progresses, the constellations in the northern part of the sky are moving northwestward - these include the familiar "Big Dipper," which is high in the northwest. At this time of year, the Pleiades can be seen in the west-northwest, and just below it the Hyades, with the bright star Aldebaran, the "fiery eye of the Bull." Following Orion to the east, Perseus and Auriga are seen, each with one of the bright stars of early spring - Capella and Mirfak. Farther to the east, the Lion, Cancer, and Gemini can be spotted. To the south, Canis Major with Sirius, and Canis Minor with Procyon are near the meridian. Overhead is the Great Square of Pegasus, and to the east, the Head of Draco and the Little Dipper are prominent.

No Case (Information Only)
Since July 1962
South America

BIG SAUCER "FLAP" IN SOUTH AMERICA: A sensational series of saucer sightings has been taking place in South America. According to the report, this "flap" has apparently been going on more or less continuously since 1957. The flap has been centered primarily in Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile, and a great number of sightings have been made, many of them by responsible witnesses such as military and civil air crews, police, and others. The sightings have been going on so long (since 1957) and are so numerous and well-witnessed that the "flap" has become almost a routine occurrence in that part of the world. The objects seen are described as large, metallic, disk-shaped craft, some of which have been observed at close range (1,000 yards or less) and better than those in the U.S. sightings during 1957-1958. The objects are reported to maneuver in the air in a manner far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. The report states that the "flap" has never been satisfactorily explained by the U.S. Air Force and that the objects have been under continuous observation by both civilian and military observers in the countries involved, but it is too poor in photographic quality to reproduce here. With the exception of a few sketches, no photographs of the objects in this "flap" are available.

Here is the text from the document:

No Case (information Only)                7 March 1952
Bolton, Lancashire, England

Form revised
Date: 8 January 1952
Witness: Mr. Terence Wildbore
Address: 10 Crompton Street, Bolton
Occupation: Salesman
Report: Mr. Wildbore states that on 7 March 1952 at approximately 7:55 pm he was walking home from work when he observed a bright light in the sky traveling in a Southerly direction at a high altitude. The light was observed for about 3-4 minutes before disappearing from view. Mr. Wildbore described the light as being "disc-shaped" and "glowing white in color."
He indicated that the object was traveling at a very high rate of speed and made no sound. Mr. Wildbore stated that the object was much brighter than any star or aircraft light he had ever seen. He further stated that the object appeared to be traveling at an altitude of around 10,000-15,000 feet.
I enquired as to whether any other persons had observed the object, but Mr. Wildbore said he was alone at the time and did not mention it to anyone else until the following day.
It is my opinion that Mr. Wildbore's report appears genuine and he seemed sincere in his description of the object he observed. I can find no explanation for the phenomenon he described and I am therefore listing this as an "unknown."

A PHOTOGRAPH FROM HAWAII
A reporter's full account 
BY JEROME SMITH JOHNSON

IN MARCH 1962 there was a report of a strange aerial object sighted over Maui, Hawaii. The incident was recorded by a newspaper reporter with a camera, and the photograph was published in the local press. This is the reporter's own account of what happened:

"On March 9, 1962 a pear-shaped UFO was photographed over Maui, Hawaii by a newspaper reporter. The object was seen at around 10:30 a.m. over the central part of the island and was in view for about fifteen minutes before disappearing. It was disc-shaped, about 20-30 feet in diameter, and was silvery-white in color. The object moved slowly at first, then accelerated and shot straight up out of sight.

This is how I came to photograph the UFO: I was driving along the highway between Wailuku and Kahului, Maui, when I noticed a brilliant silvery-white object hovering in the sky over the central part of the island. I pulled over and stopped the car to get a better look. The object was round, about the diameter of a small house, and was hovering silently at an estimated altitude of 1,500-2,000 feet. 

After a few minutes, the object began to move. It accelerated rapidly and shot straight up, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. I quickly grabbed my camera and managed to take one photograph of the object just before it vanished.

I all members of the press knew about this incident, and many in the Maui area witnessed the object. It was the talk of the island for days afterwards. Unfortunately, the photograph, when developed, did not show the object as clearly as I had hoped. But it does clearly depict the general size and shape of what I saw that morning."
