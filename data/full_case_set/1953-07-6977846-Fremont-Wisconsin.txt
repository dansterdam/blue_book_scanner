The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with two points labeled "A" and "B" to illustrate how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second and third sketches show larger scenes, including a person standing on a road and a landscape view, with instructions on how to use the smaller sketches as examples to complete the larger ones.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

DATE: 9-14-53
On the morning of July 23, 1953, Mrs. and I were fishing at the marsh of Pontriage, Wauwatosa. At approximately 8:30 a.m. a bright object hovering over the marsh was observed. This object appeared to be oblong in shape, somewhat oval, and was changing colors from flame color to white. The object hovering motionless at first made no sound. By skirting the edge of the trees the object could be seen clearly. It made no westerly movement but seemed to move closer to us. It then moved to the southeast and out of sight. The object appeared to give off light or reflection. It remained in view about 5 minutes. We were amazed at this spectacle and could not explain it. As soon as the object disappeared a military jet aircraft passed overhead at high speed.

The image contains a hand-drawn diagram depicting a landscape with a river, trees, and a boat. The diagram appears to be part of a report or document related to a UFO sighting or investigation, as indicated by the page header "USAFTIS" and the overall context provided.

Text output:

Just prior to the disappearance a white vapor like a vertical column appeared for below the object (a) cannot even judge the altitude it ascended above the clouds and disappeared after as many as 45 seconds the tree line was plainly visible and from the height of the object the river and shoreline could be readily made out there has been a peculiar noise of sibilant.

WATTS
To the Commanding Officer
Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Field
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I am writing to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object which I observed on the evening of July 9, 1952.

At about 8:30 p.m. I was driving in my car west on Highway 110, approximately 5 miles west of Fremont, Wisconsin. I first noticed a bright light in the sky to the southwest of my position. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I watched I noticed that it was maneuvering in an unusual manner. 

The object appeared to be circular in shape and was giving off a brilliant white light. It moved rapidly in a zig-zag or erratic manner for approximately 5-10 minutes. At one point it appeared to hover motionless, then it suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.

I was so intrigued by this sighting that I immediately pulled my car over to the side of the road to get a better look. I watched the object carefully through the windshield of my car. The maneuvering of the object was quite unlike anything I have ever seen before in relation to conventional aircraft. I am a licensed pilot and have a fairly extensive knowledge of aircraft in general, and I can state with certainty that this was no conventional airplane or helicopter.

These aspects were in view for approximately 5-10 minutes before the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. I hope this information is useful to your investigation. Please let me know if you require any additional details.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

"It appears that a remarkable sighting occurred slightly earlier this evening. They are certain that the object they observed was not an airplane or other conventional aircraft. They sai d it moved in a way that no aircraft they had ever seen could move. Its maneuvers were incredible and not at all like the movements of any known type of aircraft. 

It appeared to be much larger than an airplane, and it remained in view for approximately 45 minutes. They are convinced that it was not weather balloon or any other known object. They watched it move back and forth, stop suddenly, and then take off at tremendous speed. It was unlike anything they had ever seen before.  

The director of this incident is certain that they actually saw something extraordinary. Just a few minutes ago he telephoned the ATIC and related the details of their sighting, requesting that the matter be investigated further.

This description and details of this sightinge were made within a short time after the occurrence and are considered to be highly reliable. Their credibility appears to be excellent, and it would seem that this report merits thorough investigation."
