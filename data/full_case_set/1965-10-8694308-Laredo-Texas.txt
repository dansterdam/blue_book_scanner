Gentlemen:

I am enclosing five reports of sightings of UFO's, the first of which I reported by telephone to a Lt. Sutton of the Laredo Air Force Base, Texas, and since he informed me that I would be contacted by Washington, I continued to make some more observations. Today I called the Laredo Base and was told that Lt. Sutton had been transferred out some time ago, and a certain Capt. Meits suggested that I write to you direct with my reports.

I am very much interested in knowing what it is that I am seeing, if at all possible, and I would very much appreciate a reply from your good offices after evaluation of my reports.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours very truly,
[Signature redacted]

Laredo, Texas
October 19, 1965, 7:15 PM
UFO case about 315 degrees no sound, two blinking lights, about 50 feet apart or a jet plane seemed to be grass. It has no body or fuselage diameter about 200 yards made light. There was a glow about 4 feet in length and 2 feet in width. At this point, the object slowed down, thought it's all over that he (AP Reg) stopped out of his car and watched it go further as it seemed to fade into the distance. It did not seem to unwind or lose any of its luster, but as it got further away, it just became dimmer and dimmer until it got lost in the distance.
