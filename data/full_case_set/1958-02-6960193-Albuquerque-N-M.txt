CURRENT WEATHER BALLOON SCHEDULES SHOW A BALLOON
WAS RELEASED AT ALBUQUERQUE ABOUT THE TIME OF
SIGHTING, HOWEVER, WINDS TEND TO DISPROVE THIS DURING
THE TIMES GIVEN. THE BALLOON SHOULD HAVE BEEN
TRAVELING IN AN ALMOST EXACTLY WESTERLY DIRECTION.
IF IT WAS LOOKING SOUTH INSTEAD OF NORTH,
THE WINDS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BALLOON HEADING 
SE.
