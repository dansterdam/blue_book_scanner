Descriptiom is that of classic meteor. Meteor, probably of fireball class, was very startling and probably a fireball experience for the witnesses. There was some discussion whether it could have been a plane, but the silence of the sighting and the sudden disintegration of the material has been turned over to the Smithsonian Institute for analysis, but as yet no answer. ATIC opinion is that recovered material had no connection with the sighting.

TITLE: Unidentified Flying Object Observed West of Wichita Falls, Texas on 28 September 1960

1. At 10242 (0424 local), 28 September 1960, a large white streak of light was observed falling through the sky SW of Wichita Falls, Texas. Times of observation were from 2 to 3 minutes. Based upon the statements of the witnesses, no conclusion can be made that the same object was observed by all.

2. Statements of Witnesses:
Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas - Age, 20 years. 2 1/2 years of service.
Wichita Falls, Texas, Airman - Observed through the NW window of the restaurant at about 0430A.M. local time, a falling light falling to the ground. The witness estimated the object's fall to be at an angle of about 60-70 degrees from the vertical edge of the window, indicating a perpendicular fall of the object and establishing a direction of due 265 degrees (from the observer's position within the restaurant and the existence of an awning on the window, the time of observation and the elevation could not have extended beyond (from 30 to 35 elevation).

RELIABILITY: Fair. Night Watchman, Robinson Construction Co. Age 48, resides SW of the center of Wichita Falls, Mr. Robinson stepped out from his guard shack between 4:10 and 4:20 A.M. local and observed a bright blue-white flash of light lasting approximately 2 seconds. However, that if it could have been caused by welders, he turned to face a large storage tank one of his position. After making upon this tank for about 2 seconds and seeing nothing, he turned to the tank West of him and observed a bright green flash of light which appeared to be about 1,000 feet above the ground. Total time from the observance of the flash to the obscuring thereof, he stated that had the flash of light lasted longer it would surely have blinded him. Source described the color of the flash to be white light seen through blue-green glass. Source believed the object had fallen about 1/2 mile due south of his position.

2. Patrolman, Wichita Falls Police Department, Age 23, 18 months service with WFPD. RELIABILITY: Good. At 0424 A.M. local, while Checking north in his patrol car on Kemp Blvd, he observed a bright blue-white light the size of a volley ball fall at an angle through the left rear window of his patrol car. The object was seen to turn yellow as it neared the ground. Total time of sighting was a matter of seconds. He immediately turned his car around to investigate but found no trace of the object on the ground.

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

OF SEYMOUR, TEXAS.

Sergeant, Control Tower Operator, Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, Oklahoma. RELIABILITY: Unknown. Contacted by telephone. Sergeant stated that a bright light was observed falling NE to SW at 0423 A.M. local. Source observed the object for 20-25 seconds.

RELIABILITY: Unknown. Contacted by telephone. Age 56, unemployed, stated a round, white light, larger than the moon, fell WSW of Archer City. Source observed the object descend about 15,000' of elevation. The light appeared to slow down and then continue its fall. Object became smaller as it fell.

FALLS, TEXAS. MRS. APT C, WICHITA FALLS, TEXAS. RELIABILITY: Housewife. Observed from the kitchen window about 0830 A.M. local, a falling light, described as a large quantity of glowing matter in long streaks flowing through the sky from SW to NE at an indeterminate altitude. A smaller object appeared to break from the larger mass, taking the form of a ball with string-like streamers. The material continued while the individual streamers fell. Observer was attracted to the phenomenon because of the quantity of that matter floating in the air as on the apartment roof. She managed to catch a piece of the material about 3" x 2" before it disintegrated. The material had a rubber-like quality and upon contact with her hand, shrank to the size of a 25 cent piece. MRS. APT C stated the material appeared to be foil-like and a quantity of the material was observed on the apartment roof.

3. A search of the area 2 miles SW of Wichita Falls was conducted from 4:20 to 6:40 A.M. by Policeman (par 2c) with negative results. A balloontype object with trailing streamers, light colored, was observed by Policeman joining ground and extending progressively more SW of the city, with negative results. On 30 September, the balloontype object investigators searched the area in the vicinity of Wichita and Seymour, Texas to check out the statement of the truck driver (par 2a), without locating an object. Triangulation on the location of the fall at Wichita Falls and Vernon, Texas, the point of fall was found to be in the vicinity of Seymour, Texas.

4. Comments of Investigators:
There can be little doubt that an object was observed, based simply upon the large number of witnesses. Although individual reports appear to describe the same incident, there is a saturation that the time was 0423-0442 A.M. local, based upon fairly precise time checks by Clinton-Sherman AFB, and by a recording of the incident at Wichita Falls. Upon which the time of 0423-0442 of the Clinton-Sherman AFB report would further agree. While certain features appear fairly consistent through most witnesses' statements, there is quite a variation in more brilliant and unusual phenomenon seen, falling to the SW of Wichita Falls, with no noise. All reports received place the direction at SOUTHWEST, LOCATION, NEAR VERNON, TEXAS (par 2d) and the time of occurrence between 0423-0442 A.M. local, for no triangulation. Most witnesses believed the object had fallen to a spot approximately 30 miles to a side. The report from Iowa Park (par 2c) is especially valuable because of the witnesses' experience and because no one was alarmed or frightened by the phenomenon.

REPORT NO. 1419297 PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

Sheppard AF, Age 47, Eight Years experience as a USAF Procurement Officer, RELIABILITY: High. On 10 Sept 1953 at about 4:30 A.M. on Highway 287 in Iowa Park, Texas, Captain Sheppard observed an object above the horizon at about 30° elevation for an estimated duration of 22-25 seconds. He watched while the object within 3-5 seconds fell to an elevation of 10-20° and an estimated speed of 240° which pointed to burn out. Source was a private citizen who reported to him. No photographs were taken. Color was bright white. Object appeared to possess a metallic luster. No noise was heard. Object appeared to possess a metallic luster. 

RELIABILITY: HIGH. John S. Wichita Falls, Texas, Age 50 years, Independent Truck Driver. While hauling a load of pipe traveling W on US Routes 82/277, 3/4 of a mile S of Megargel, Texas, observed through the driver's open window a bright light on the ground. The light was falling or passing through the object for 10-15 seconds. He stopped his vehicle to get a better look and then the object rose up behind some trees and went out of sight for a short time before going out. During flight, object was of such brilliance to light up the fence wires along the road. No sound was heard. Source believes object fell near the road, since he was traveling at about 40 MPH and had to look progressively more behind him to see the glowing object on the ground. He viewed the object but saw nothing on the ground.

RELIABILITY: UNKNOWN. Contacted by phone, Mr. S. Wichita Falls, Texas, operator of a furniture store. Reported that through a window of his home, an object was the color of the moon, much larger than a star and fell behind some trees after 3 seconds of observation. Source did not see the ground lit up.

RELIABILITY: Good. Patrolman, Wichita Falls Police Department. 1 1/2 years experience. Conversing through respective open windows of their patrol cars, the patrolman viewed the object in the sky which appeared to descend. It was described as small, about the size of two finger tips held at arm's length, white in color. It was observed to fall without tumbling through the air and behind the buildings across the street after 6-8 seconds. A glow was then observed around the building, lasting another 6-8 seconds. Source stated the object came down, but at the time of interview, he was uncertain about this point.

Source did not see the ground lit up.

That he was able to devote full attention to the sighting, viewing it in relatively open country, lends support to the hypothesis that the object did not land, but hovered up in the atmosphere, as he reported. Further, the absence of noise, reported by all observed, suggests that the distance to the object, as far as known, was considerably in excess of the speed of sound to the area. The continuous duration of sightings was also noted.

5. Evaluation:
a. It is the preparing officer's opinion that, based upon analysis of the witnesses' reports, the object seen was probably a meteorite of unusual brilliance which probably burned up completely in the atmosphere, but possibly could have landed considerably to the SW of Wichita Falls, perhaps in the vicinity of the Texas/New Mexico border.
b. The material recovered by the Wichita Falls housewife and attached to this report can only be given a tentative evaluation. Possibly floating spider web material. It is felt that the material recovered bears no connection to the meteorite sighted earlier in the morning.

Something was reported as having hit the ground at Sheppard AFB. Reports coming to ATIC with great frequency. The 112th group from Ft. Belvoir has been sent to scene. First report to ATIC said it was seen in the early morning of 28 September and that a search would be started by Sheppard at daybreak. In addition to personnel at Sheppard investigating, press is on scene, also radio and TV. Nothing on the space track. ATIC has no positive information, but does not believe it to be a moon dust item (this is their vernacular for the refuse of any earth launched satellite, or what have you). People at Sheppard claim they know that it fell in a nearby area. ATIC believes that it is meteoric. Major Cooper may be contacted Tel 3225621, ext 516.
