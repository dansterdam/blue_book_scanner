Dear Major Heston A. Jacke,

I feel very grateful for your favor of giving me the dates: March 23rd, to my letter of March 2nd 1964. I have the information regarding your point. I did not want to burden that boy again, even if it was high, because the boy, was telling the truth, even if it was impossible. I told the story to the Air Ministry, that the the light was seen by many and written in the Daily Mail. There is also a magazine, "The Flying Saucer Review" which has the comments.

There is also the comments to be had, the matter that the light of the Unidentified Flying Objects was seen, there was over 40 schoolchildren, could not be fooled, and some men and women, and some sun and cloud particles in the atmosphere. It was in full view, and the sky was quite clear. The light was quite remarkable, and was seen from the city would have caused a panic. The witnesses attended the attention of kind and his friends and relations, and to some extent, the photograph can be explained over the question to the children as usual, and some parents had requested not to go near. It was reported to be the explanation of the which it interest.

sincerely

It appears to be a typed document from the Foreign Technology Division of the Air Force which discusses a proposed reply regarding the submission of a photograph. The document outlines their response on how to handle such submissions and provides guidance on the criteria for studying reported UFO sightings.

Proposed Reply

1. The delay in replying to your letter of 2 March 1964 was due to the reproduction of the photograph you submitted. We can assure you that such delays in our evaluation of incoming photographic material are unavoidable, and that your case is receiving our earnest consideration and attention, as well as other agencies.

2. If these objects are to be studied scientifically they can only be GOOD QUALITY aerial photographs. Inferior fragmentary pictures and negative impressions, and optical phenomena such as ball lightning, are just that, and as such are not acceptable as fact. Photographs that show no familiar reference points, and which fail to contribute significantly to our knowledge of aerial phenomena, are not worthy of detailed analysis or lengthy correspondence.

3. In regard to your request of whether a sighting is of close range or not is questionable. Sightings from outside our own planet, with their attendant phenomenon of bizarre and unknown characteristics, are indeed interesting and undoubtedly real, but these cannot be explained by our air forces. Again, these are reports of something people have seen, and their opinions and interpretations may differ widely.

4. As to whether a sighting is of close range or not is questionable. There are many cases of sightings that are considered to be "close range" but which have subsequently been found to be distant objects. This point is made clear in the investigations and findings of Project BLUE BOOK. Reliable reports of close range sightings are rare, since an object sighted at close range reflects a very localized and transient phenomenon.

automobile and besieging the transmouse with such hostility that the image quality was lost, and the investigation showed that without doubt the object was the planet Jupiter, but your photograph of an unknown object is well taken. The Air Force has never denied that these reported sightings have been made, but attempts to indentity them as known or natural phenomena., etc. May I remind you that the burden of proof does not lie with us to prove that "Flying Saucers" do not exist. proof that they do not exist must come from those who claim they do exist., etc. The report from British, Texas is an illustration for the above conclusions insofar as no called flying saucers having any physical evidence for their existence over the years has been established., etc. No positive evaluation of the photograph you sent to us can be made without the negative., etc. It is possible that the images are real, however, the spots on the print are similar to those printed which have been distorted to either flaws in the negative, a flaw in the film, emulation spots or poor photo processing.

This document does not contain a photograph. The text found in the document is as follows:

b. In reading the reported situation during which the photographic evidence was taken, we find that:
(1) We do not wish to question the integrity of the boy who submitted the report. However, the Air Ministry would hold a youth or 14 for questioning, if they considered that the information would more likely be taken.
(2) The statement by Mr. A. H. H. was no fault as to the cause or the printed images.
(3) No photographic expert would offer an explanation for this print as the Air Ministry nor any photographer experts would offer no explanation for this chance.
(4) Photographic experts viewed the negatives and could find no signs of distortion. However, they offer no explanation with the negatives. They maintain that there is no fault or tampering with the negatives.
(5) While the photographic experts maintain that there would be no full explanation offered, of course their statements are being noted and without doubt, the possibly/probably would indicate any such further or contact, with the complete situation and existing only the possibility/probable was indicated.
6. We appreciate your opinions and your interest in the United States Air Force position regarding unidentified flying objects. At this time, we are returning your photograph and three duplicate copies.

UFO - INFORMATION

Dear Sir:

I thank you very much for sending me your letter sheets and upon reading them and upon reading past letters I am somewhat confused and not entirely sure what you would really like me to take up.

Usually myself, with the assistance of a technical staff and a team of physicists, meteorologists, astronomers and specialists in other fields, have been attempting to examine and evaluate, with much success, the reported sightings of unidentified flying objects.

But there is also qualitative evidence to be taken into consideration. The difficulty lies in distinguishing between the actual reports and the "wishful thinking" of the "little men."

This would lead one to make an inference as to the possible existence of unidentified flying objects. However, the findings of the measures of the adverse people in different countries, who have adopted a skeptical attitude, are just as valid. The closeness and the similarity of the reports are striking, but this may be just because of the short distances involved and the psychological factors involved.

It is thought that the incidents of "little men" which have been revealed are entirely imaginary and are psychomechanical conditions, perhaps similar to the "little man" hallucinations which spur on and sustain the beliefs of religious mystics.

It is clear that the close-range cases differ for there seems to be physical and tangible evidence. But even here there still remains the possibility that these are induced illusions or hallucinations - thus producing a subjective reality.

However, there is obviously a small percentage of reports which deserve further investigation, as they may provide information for advancing the technical and scientific level of our civilization. It is to these reports that we must devote our attention.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a "Flying Saucer Incident" that occurred in April 1962.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
4 MARCH 1962
SHEFFIELD, ENGLAND

FLYING SAUCER INCIDENT - 7 APRIL 1962
According to reports, it was around 1030 on the evening of 7 April 1962, when the scene of an unidentified flying object was observed in the sky above the Sheffield area. It was described as a brightly lit, circular object, which hovered above the city for some time, before suddenly shooting off at tremendous speed. The object was sighted by many individuals, including a witness named David Brownlow, 18, who was questioned under the branch about what he had observed.
The Air Ministry clarified that these sightings were the result of a known Phenomenon and pending further investigation, no further action would be taken. The incident was briefly covered in the national press, but no further details became publicly available due to issues of national security and the requirements of the Ministry of Defense for confidentiality.
As there is no further information to this case, it is understood that the incident was treated as an information only report by the authorities, with no formal investigation or evaluation undertaken.
