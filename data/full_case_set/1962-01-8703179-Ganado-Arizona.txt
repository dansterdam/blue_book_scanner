The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a Project 10073 record card with various information filled out, including the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects, course, and a brief summary of the sighting. The text on the form can be transcribed as follows:

1. DATE: 29 Jan 62
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: 
3. PHOTOS: X
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: □ Ground-Radar □ Ground-Visual X Air-Visual
5. SOURCE: 4
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 min
8. COURSE: 
9. COURSE: 
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Bright light above horizon directed toward southwest initially. Suddenly it moved rapidly up, accelerating sharply to incredible speed. Changed course and direction and disappeared into distance within a matter of seconds. No smoke or trail visible. Seemed to change also in size and intensity.
11. COMMENTS:
This is probably some type of light source, either natural or man-made. However, the incredible acceleration and disappearance within a matter of seconds is rather unusual. Cannot positively identify this observation.

The image does not contain any photographs. However, it does contain a typed report on a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet. The text of the report is as follows:

"We (a group of us) have seen this object quite a few times. It is seen a defined object (ASST-11460203) which is triangular in shape, and has been reported by many people in this area. It was an aircraft of some sort, but I would hesitate to call it a space ship or something the like. It is a little worth of saying, that to the best of my knowledge it was not of earthly origin -the time, a definite rapid speed, and a strange brand of flying leads me to this conclusion. It was first sighted and viewed with the naked eye to be a very strange and peculiar sight."

a. Sound little to no noise, almost silent, very little or no sound at all
b. Color bright reddish green color green and blue

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page is divided into several questions for the witness to answer, including instructions to draw a picture showing the motion of the observed object, questions about the size and angular size of the object, whether it disappeared during the sighting, and a request to describe in the witness's own words an object or objects that would give the same appearance as the one observed.

The text from the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object. The sketch shows a circular or disc-shaped object with an indistinct or "fuzzy" outline, as described in the question.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Whirring
b. Color - Red to green lights and

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

A hand-drawn sketch showing a disc-shaped object with a swirling, indistinct outline. The text states that the object appeared to be moving through the atmosphere.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
Other -

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
1
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text and a diagram.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Moved from A to B to C Location

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? 

Slightly larger than a match head

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? C 5° 45 t

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Yes. Gradually faded and finally disappeared. Watching for 30 minutes.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects of the size, shape, and apparent speed and brightness, which would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Small round ball, brighter than a car headlight, pulsating, gradually fading and then disappeared.

31. If you are familiar with bearing terms (angular direction), try to estimate the number of degrees the object was from true North (this east) and also the number of degrees it was above the horizon (elevation).
31.1 When it first appeared:
a. From true North 28-75 degrees.
b. From horizon 15 degrees.

31.2 When it disappeared:

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and the instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the observed object was above the horizon, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the viewer first saw it.

The second image contains two larger sketches. The first larger sketch shows a person walking down a road with trees and buildings in the background. The second larger sketch shows a person standing in a landscape with mountains in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
