The text in the document is as follows:

"Sighting 1; Barbados, BWI Mar 7, 1962 Barbados, Barbados - Caribbean
This case relates to an unidentified flying object which was observed over Barbados, Barbados, West Indies on 7 March 1962.
Name: American Air Defense Command, Washington, D.C. - Defense Environmental.
Date: Last evening - September 14, 1962 (.5 year or incident)
Details: Telephonic information received from an unnamed source in Barbados, B.W.I. at approximately 2300Z on 7 March 1962 indicated that a strange object was observed in the sky over Barbados. The object was described as being approximately 30 feet in diameter, a vivid red-orange color, and was observed for a period of 3 to 5 minutes before disappearing from view. A number of persons were said to have observed the object, and it was reported that the object displayed erratic maneuvering characteristics and appeared to be under intelligent control.
I am beginning this to give a detailed account as I had made up my mind to report the matter and I feel that the 8-9 months delay should not preclude documenting this. I was obviously quite impressed at the time and feel it merits an official report, even if out of time.
I was vacationing in Barbados at the time and happen to be in the vicinity when the sighting occurred. Several neighbors and friends in the area also observed the object and we discussed it at some length the next day. I was able to obtain a fairly detailed description from them at that time. 
From the south and out of the island a red-orange object appeared to approach at a rather rapid rate, perhaps 600-800 mph. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and had a vivid red-orange color. As it reached a point perhaps 5 miles from my location, it abruptly changed direction to the west and accelerated rapidly, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds. The maneuver was quite startling and impressive, unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen."

1. In accordance with referenced letter and paragraph 15 of AFR 200-2, dated 14 September 1959, the following information is submitted:

On 30 November 1962, Mr. V. H. DIAL, Greensdale, Missouri, Scott AFB, Ill., stated that he had been acquainted with UFO's for many years and has had numerous sightings, but this was his first close contact case. He stated that he was in his automobile, on his way home, when he observed a large craft above the road in front of him. The craft was approximately 150 feet in diameter, disc-shaped, and hovering at an estimated altitude of 200-300 feet. Mr. DIAL stated that he was involved in a near accident when his automobile seemed to be pulled toward the craft. He was able to regain control of his automobile and continued on his way. Mr. DIAL stated that there were no other witnesses to the incident and that he did not report it to any authorities at the time.

On 30 November 1962, Mr. EUGENE WILLIAMS, Greensdale, Missouri, stated that he was a member of the local volunteer fire department and had been called to a farm in the vicinity of Greensdale, Missouri, in the early morning hours of 3 December 1962, to investigate a reported UFO landing. Mr. WILLIAMS stated that he and two other members of the fire department arrived at the farm shortly after the incident was reported. They found that a circular area of approximately 150 feet in diameter had been burned into the grass. The burned area was still smoldering when they arrived. No other physical evidence was observed. Approximately 150 persons had gathered in the area to observe the landing site. Mr. WILLIAMS stated that it was his opinion that the object had landed briefly and then departed, leaving the burned area as the only evidence of its presence.
