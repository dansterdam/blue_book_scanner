The form is part of Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects conducted by the United States Air Force. This particular form has been filled out with information about a sighting that occurred on January 20, 1949, and was recorded after an interview on February 7, 1949.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At a point 6.2 miles NE of San Antonio, Texas, about 150 yards on Judson Road off intersection of Judson Road and Nacogdoches Road, M/Sgt Ellis Stone saw an object which appeared to be in the form of a sphere, the color of which appeared a luminous bluish green intermingled with a yellow tinge. Object was seen between the readings of 325° and 295° off magnetic north and was believed to have been traveling from ESE to N. Time of travel in this azimuth was estimated at 5 seconds. Object was first observed at an elevation of 15° and as it disappeared over a small hill the elevation had dropped to about 12°. It was moving with a gliding effect from the observer's right to his left and slightly away from the point of observation. The trail varied in length from approximately three times the diameter of the object to six or seven times the diameter. Color of the trail appeared a light pink with bright red sparks spraying from the trail at about 1/2 the distance of the length. (The trail was a straight shot-back trail with these sparks emitted making the only irregularity).

M/Sgt Ellis C. Stone, Headquarters Fourth Army, AG Section, reports observing an unidentified aerial phenomenon on 20 January 1949 between the hours of 1800 and 1900 (looser estimate given to be about 1835 hours).

The point from which this observation was made is 6.2 miles northeast of the city of San Antonio, Texas, about 150 yards on Judson Road at the intersection of Judson Road and Nacogdoches Road.

In making compass sightings on the azimuth of the observation it was determined that the object was seen between the readings of 325° to 297° with the first noticed the object was traveling in a path believed to have been from the 293 direction. When first observed was at an elevation of about 15° and as object went out of sight over a small hill, the elevation had dropped to about 12°.

The object appeared to be in the form of a sphere the color of which appeared to be luminous bluish green intermingled with a yellow tinge. It was moving with a gliding motion from the observers right to his left and slightly away from the point of observation.

The trail from the object varied in length from approximately three times the diameter of the object to six or seven times the diameter. Color of this trail appeared to be a light pink with bright red sparks spitting from the trail at about one half the distance of this length. The trail was a straight streak and with these sparks emitted making the only irregulatirley.

No investigation was recommended that the following named persons may have seen the object since they are known to have been in the same vicinity as Informant at the time of his observation. They will be interrogated.

Mr. ------ --------
Route 3, San Antonio, Texas
[address redacted], believed to be of Converse, Texas. (10 miles north of the telephone installation on the Austin Highway between San Antonio and Converse, Texas).
Two boys identified as sons of Mr. --------
Mrs. ------ wife of M/Sgt Stone, and their son.

The persons in charge of the CAA Office, Cowork Tower, and Airport Manager of the San Antonio Municipal Airport were interviewed. These persons had received no reports of any unusual aerial activity. The tower was closed all but commercial aircraft and "one or two" special flights during the evening.
