CASE: KPOCH-8251 FILE: KPOCH-8257 DATE: 29 AUG 57 CONTROL NR. 2
IT 024 752/1-19/ATIC 52/HOXA

1. A review of TR-1642-57 shows insufficient evidence on which to evaluate the sighting as reported, or sufficient data from which to establish a pattern or trend. As stated in the last sentence there were facts that cast doubt as to the validity of the reports, and that " ...aircraft of any sort."

2. From the analysis of the physical evidence, there is no further evidence that rules out aircraft or missiles.

3. From the position of the observer with respect to a sun low in the horizon, it appears that identification of some celestial object, differing with the viewing conditions, was the explanation given by the observer.
