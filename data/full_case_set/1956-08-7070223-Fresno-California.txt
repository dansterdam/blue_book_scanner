Dear Sir:
Received your letter and forms of the what. I realize you thank me for reporting - I mailed them sketches of what I saw - with a note about others - I hope you received all of them. In any case - copies are on hand - will be glad to forward some - but my job will be a little easier if you would kindly forward forms necessary to give detailed information - makes it very much easier to complete the picture. 
Constantly trying to have it on record - it certainly gets a busy phone to have interested parties.
Thanks to you this - and I hope to be of a little help some where along the line -
Yours sincerely

First - May I mention that shortly after the passage of flying objects my wife and I could see that they were quite high up and I could hear no sound in connection with them. Shortly after, they completely disappeared from view. 

Approximately 9:45 PM on Aug 7, 1956 my wife and I were sitting on the porch in back of our house. The moon was just rising over the trees but quite bright - without artificial light. I noticed some movement in the sky and pointed out to my wife a group of approximately 6-8 objects moving in rapid succession or "flight" from the west going east. They were traveling at a very high rate of speed and making no sound whatsoever. The objects passed overhead disappearing from view in the east. I would estimate that this occurred over a period of about 20 minutes.

Dear Major Gradrom,

My best wishes for your good health. If you will recall my former conversation regarding a central point for forwarded information.

Enclosed are three sketches (rough) on the matter. I have others on hand - but forwarded only those which were observed recently for 5-6 nights. Have also inquired also that were not exhibited due to my not-realizing that others were to follow.

I hope I have not wasted your time, and that these may be of some interest to this at Hamilton Field.

Thanking you for your help & consideration,
Yours truly
