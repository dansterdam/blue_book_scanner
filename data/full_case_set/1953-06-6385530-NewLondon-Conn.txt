FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED 10-20 MILES SEE NEW LONDON CONN. APPEARED TO BE CIGAR SHAPED, DID NOT MAKE SOUND, WAS VISIBLE FOR 8-10 MINUTES AND DISAPPEARED 
INTO OCEAN. THE FLYING OBJECT WAS WITNESSED BY PILOTS AT GROTON, CONN. AND DROP PILOTS INTO THE OCEAN VIA PARACHUTE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING IT.
EASTERN AIR LINES FLIGHT 460 WAS ALSO SEEN TO PASS THROUGH THE AREA AT TIME OF INCIDENT AND MAY HAVE SEEN THE OBJECT.
Supplemental PROMPT FOLLOW:

FLYING OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED BY PILOTS AT APPROX 2130E 20 JUN 53. TWO WERE OUT OF GROTON,CONN. PILOT WAS MAC A 610 AIR CREW. WAS FOLLOWED BY 1700K PILOT AT APPROX 2200E 20 JUN 53. OBJECT WAS CIGAR SHAPED AND DISAPPERARED INTO OCEAN. NO SOUND OR EXHAUST WAS OBSERVED. RESCUE ATTEMPTS BY USAF AND AIR FORCE FAILED TO LOCATE OBJECT.

General Remarks:
Although no sighting time is given in the original PROMPT, the descriptive location and details cited in both reports are nearly coincidental as to arouse the suspicion that the several incidents observed involved the same or related phenomena.

24 June 1953

Description
On 24 June 1953 one unidentified flying object was sighted by two Eastern Airlines flights and one American Airlines flight approaching New London, Connecticut. The object appeared to burst into flames as it broke into two pieces, soon afterwards extinguishing itself and dropping into the ocean.

Discussion
This incident was solved very easily. Supplementary information received by Project Blue Book on 26 June 1953 stated "Objects sighted by pilots at approximately 2130E 24 June 1953. Two jet aircraft out of Groton Point, R.I. had a mid-air collision at 2130E 24 June 1953. Aircraft fell in flames 15 miles west of Groton Point." After interrogation of pilots, it was concluded that the flight did observe the above.

Conclusion
Was aircraft.

Dear Sir:

Reference your letter dated 29 June 1953 reporting an unidentified aerial object sighting by Captain D. V. Kelley on 24 June 1953 at 2150 Eastern Standard Time.

The following data will fully explain this sighting:

Two jet aircraft out of Groton Point NAS had a mid-air collision which resulted in their striking the water. The time of the collision was approximately 2150 Eastern Standard Time, 24 June 1953.

Project Blue Book wishes to express its appreciation to your organization for reporting this incident. If at any other time in the future your organization encounters any unidentified aerial phenomena, do not hesitate to report it as soon as possible. In the past, we have had several valuable reports from American Airlines pilots. Thank you again for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

BARBARA P. HANAWALT

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. However, the image contains a letter addressed to the Chief Air Tactical Intelligence, ATIC - 20, from American Airlines, providing details about an incident that occurred on June 29, 1953 involving American Airlines flight 359.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Chief Air Tactical Intelligence
ATIC - 20
Wright - Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

In accordance with a request submitted by Flight Service through the Wright Air Route Control Center, we are attaching a report concerning an observation which was made while operating American Airlines flight 359 between Boston and La Guardia on June 29, 1953.

"Flight 359 was just north of Woonsocket at 4,000 feet on compass course of 220 degrees. The pilot observed a strange object in the sky to the south. According to the light flash, it appeared to have occurred at an estimated altitude of 14,000 feet. The light then broke into two separate lights, and the light increased in size up into two separate lights, one much larger than the other. All lights fell towards the ground, diminishing in size until they disappeared it took between one and one-half and two and one-half minutes.

"I can only guess, but it is my observation the objects fell into the Sound in an area bounded by westerly, Rhode Island; Block Island and Montauk Point."

If we may be of further assistance concerning this incident, please advise.

Yours very truly,
AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.
