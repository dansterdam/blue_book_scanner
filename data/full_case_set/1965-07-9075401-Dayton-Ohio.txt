SOURCE: AFRO Bulletin, Sep-Oct 65

The Warminster Phenomena:
The town of Warminster, England, is a small town in the West Country. It has been the scene of some strange occurrences in the vicinity of several large defense and/or military installations. Since Christmas Day, 1964, there has been a good deal of talk of "mysterious noises" in that town, and at first glance it would seem that many UFO's are involved in these happenings. 

Mr. Arthur Shuttlewood, variously described as an editor and reporter, has noted some of the strange goings-on. To wit:

As of 8:15 a.m. on Christmas Day, Mrs. Hump, a widow, was walking to early morning service at Christ Church when she became aware of a strange droning sound above her, accompanied by a high-pitched whine.

Suddenly, she was quite inexplicably, "swept off her feet" and thrown to the ground in shock, screaming for help, and finally others heard her and rushed to her assistance. No harm was done, but she was very shaken. She was helped to a seat. She sat through the remainder of the service "jelly-legged".

At exactly the same time that Mrs. Rye first heard "the thing", (dubbed by Shuttlewood), Head Postmaster Roger Flump and his wife were awakened in their home by the loud, peculiar noises coming from their roof. Rump said, "The ceiling shook. It was just as though 5,000 bees were swarming on it."

Uses on our roof were being rattled and picked up by some terrific force. Then a frantic scrambling sound as if three large birds or small animals were tearing hungrily over the roof. This impressed Mr. and Mrs. Rump throughout the experience, a most unnerving droning and strange "crackler tones behind it." The noises lasted a total of only about a 
"Three minutes prior to the experience of the Rumps and Mrs. Rye, a woman who requested her name withheld was awakened by the barking and whimpering of a dog outside in the field a quarter mile distant. At 8:12 a.m. everything became quiet again. They sent their daughter Josie out to see what was wrong, and in the garden her 12-year-old found the animal cowering in a corner of a low-roofed greenhouse. Josie could see nothing wrong. Joel, the dog, spoke to him and started back into the house. The door slammed behind him.

Before Josie reached the door, there came a "weird, crackling" and a high-pitched sound, and she was "battered down" by some unseen force. "I felt what I thought was an ice-cold tongue wipe the back of my neck", she reported. "My head was jerked forward and down. I struggled and screamed and managed to make a dive for the house and the door seemed to break the hold the thing" had on her.

In one of the same articles with the foregoing information, Shuttlewood notes that Rev. Thomas P. Graham, the vicar of St. Giles' Church, and his wife Patricia and their three children, D., 11, P., 6, and B., 5, all saw a "brightly glowing, cigar-shaped object which remained in the high sky over Warminster for 20 minutes", Shuttlewood projected to mention a date or time.

Because of the proximity of the military and governmental installations, it was suggested by some in the Warminster area that the strange phenomena was the result of new devices being tested in the area. However, authorities representing these installations stated that there had been no current testing of any aircraft or other military or scientific objects.

Dr. Gordon C. Pollard, a botanist, zoologist, and biologist, is one of the residents of Warminster who thinks the strange phenomena are not to be lightly brushed aside. He told Shuttlewood of a flock of pigeons killed suddenly - and mysteriously - in flight, with no explanation. He examined them soon after they fell, and each bird showed no sign of injury or vigor mortis.

There are no other photographs or images visible in this document page.

Warminster...

(Continued from page 7)

On August 25th, a photograph of the "thing" was reportedly taken. Carried in man's hat, brim turned down, and top crushed with a large central crease, the photo resembles "rather deeply-set eyes, with large wide-set and small iris stone oval opening." The photographer, a young man (23) Gordon Faulkner, a factory worker, said this happened on the 25th. In early evening, he stepped out of the back door of his home, on his way to see his sister had asked to borrow a ring. He shut the door behind him and saw the "thing" over the south of Warminster, he said he could just make out the unusual shape, focused his camera and pressed the trigger as the object entered the view-finder. Faulkner said: "It was as bright as the sun, and as small a size. I took one film, it shook me when I saw what came out of it all."

Faulkner then sent the photograph (after developing) to the Warminster Times, who returned it, saying they couldn't publish it. The September 11, 1965 issue of the Daily Mirror presented another photograph, "apparently that of a human being jumping off his bike and quickly focussing a camera" which was claimed captured the same "thing," according to coombe a resident of 33, St Mudjid-road, Battersea, London, on Monday, September 6th. Coombe claimed this photo did not resemble the "thing" Faulkner saw. Then Coombe says he doesn't claim to know what the "thing" was, but wants to know if and when permission is secured to present this bulletin, if they wish such exposure, they will be presented with documentation.

Sunnyvale, Calif.- Lt John E. Haag and Officers Sonstrd Siteard of the Public Safety Dept were on duty at the fire station at Lawrence Station and Mountain View-Alviso road when they observed an object in the sky for 10 minutes from 9:33 to 9:43 p.m. on the 6th of July. Both officers declared they are familiar with aircraft in the area and that this object, after hovering, was "faster than anything I'd ever seen before". It went straight up into the air and disappeared. The object was described as being at a great distance from the ground which was about 20 degrees, then, without hesitating, it made a sharp turn southwest for about three miles and then turned northwest. Both officers were sure the object was not a star, and observed that it pulsated on and off from dim to bright in three second cycles. They thought the object might have been from Moffett Moffett planes were scrambled, but said planes from other bases might have observed the object.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW 
JAN-FEB 66

TUNISIA
"Mme. S. Affiad alerted her friends on Mr. Normandy, sont us this interesting tetter from the October 1965 issue of the Tunisian magazine "SOURCES" (in French by J. Vuilleque), "On July 8, 1965, a housewife and person in Feriana (Tunisia) saw a luminous machine of about 5,000 meters. It was transluscent and the edges were more condensed than the centre, according to the statement of L'aerostore office official who had observed the object through a theodolite.
The machine was revolving slowly on its axis, giving out small circles in such a way that it appeared to be moving smoothly. It remained in place for about fifteen minutes.
The control tower at the aerodrome of El-Aouina warned all possible collision.
On the arrival of small clouds, the UFO rose slowly towards the north west without noise, and without leaving any trace of its passage. (T.S.S.)"

FLYING OBJECTS STOP CLOCKS
(Costa Rica, March 11, 1965) - The latest incident involving a flying object has puzzled the residents of Dayton, Ohio. The incident occurred when several residents reported that their electric clocks stopped working at the same time that they saw a mysterious object in the sky. The reports indicate that the object was seen moving at a high rate of speed and then suddenly stopped, after which the clocks of those who witnessed the event stopped working. The incident has left the residents puzzled and searching for an explanation.

alternatively to either side, very slight.

In an attempt to estimate the object's size, Fernandes said that when he stretched out his arms and extended the object to cover the space about 20 inches between his hands. Because we do not know the height of the trees nor the elevation of the object, we have made no estimate of its actual size. Fernandes estimated that the object was close and very large.

Fernandes estimated that the object remained stationary about 3 minutes, then moved at high speed. He noted that when the object departed there was no acceleration - it was as if it had been a bullet shot from a gun. Fernandes said that when the object disappeared there was a great deal of static from the time the object first showed up until it sped away. It is thought that while they had been listening to the program they had been listening to could be heard clearly again.

Three days prior to the Fernandes sighting, on the 9th, a story came out of the Azores concerning a jet which was observed by personnel at the Santa Maria Airport in the Azores.

The Air Force rather vague, but fortunately FATE magazine inquired in the incident via United Press International and considerably more information was learned. It is from this account that some of the following information was gleaned:

The object was apparently cylindrical-shaped and one of the first eye-witnesses to its passage over the island was Artides Arruda, a 31-year-old gardener at the Pera Norte Hotel. At 4:30 p.m. on July 8th, Arruda was returning from the hotel, and spotted the object. He said he thought it was a balloon at first, because it was brown colored and ellipse-shaped, moving from southeast to northwest. The ground wind was generally opposite.

Another observer was 28-year-old Richard Godbold, a civilian radio expert working at the USAF Base in Flores Island and currently assigned to Santa Maria. Godbold had no opinion concerning what it was, said it could have been a balloon. A technical driver also saw the object but could not describe it in a way which would help to identify it.

In the FATE story, UPI noted that Lajes Airport officials strongly silent about the object, with a "no comment" on the matter. The initial news press had mentioned the fact that the electro-magnetic clocks at the airport had stopped while the object was in sight, and the pilot sighted the object. However, later press reports said no such thing happened.

The Portuguese UAOs

Shortly after 4:30 a.m. on the 19th of July, 1963, Mr. and Mrs. Manuel Fernandez of Moita, near Lisbon, Portugal, were awakened by a loud noise outside. They went outdoors well with buckets to get water. She took a quick look at the sky and saw an object coming out of the northwest, which she described as strange-looking. According to the interviews, Mrs. F. admitted she was startled at first, thinking it was a strange airplane, with which she was familiar.

The object, which looked like a "cardinal's hat", had a round "brim" and a rounded top. It stopped over the woods near their home and Mrs. Fernandez dropped her buckets and ran to get her husband. During a later interview, Mr. F. said his wife was so excited she had difficulty understanding what he told him, and at first thought she had seen a cardinal's hat in the courtyard. When he looked, he saw the thing about a quarter of a mile away from the house. He said the object had a dark, round brim and a brilliant, orange-colored round top, which looked as if the light was coming from the inside. "At one point on the brim, exactly on the side closer to the airport, there was a strong white light", Mr. Fernandez reported. Although it stayed just above the trees, the object leaned.

FLYING SAUCERS ARE ZIPPING AGAIN

LISBON, (AP) Portugal. -- Unidentified flying objects - usually described as shining in two or more colors and ranging from 30 to 50 feet in diameter - have been seen in the night skies over the northern city of Oporto, Portugal, a reliable source reported today.

The first sight was reported July 1. Since then there have been three other sightings by persons in different parts of the city. The objects reportedly give off a glow and make a slight humming sound.

The night the objects were first seen, a family reported they had seen a flat, circular object with a brilliant white light in the center. It had no visible means of propulsion but moved swiftly. 

On another occasion, a local dentist and his wife reported they had seen a luminous disc-shaped object with a central red light. This object moved at high speed and then suddenly shot straight up out of sight.

The source said the Portuguese air force and the civil authorities were investigating the reports.

Flying Saucer Storm Clocks
Say Reports From Portugal
LIBSON, PORTUGAL - According to Portuguese sources, the Portuguese press reported several flying saucer sightings in the northern part of the country late in the afternoon of March 25th. The witnesses claimed interference from an electrical disturbance in their daily activities.
THE FIRST REPORTED INCIDENT was when Fernando Fernandes, a carpenter, had just returned home from work when he and his wife at first saw a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to approach their residence and hovered a short distance above their home. It had orange coloring and seemed to oscillate from side to side.
The saucer stopped at rather high altitude, the witnesses said, and sent out what looked like a beam of light. At this point, Fernandes lost control of their radio, which stopped playing. After some minutes, the light disappeared in the direction from which it had come.
A PHYSICAL TRACE was left on the ground where the beam of light had struck, and it was examined by the Weather Bureau in the Azores. The branch also reported the incident to the Geographical Institute in Lisbon.

FLYING SAUCERS OVER PORTUGAL. Strange objects moving through space were reported in widely-separated parts of Portugal on July 12th. The first appearance was in Obidost where a number of witnesses stated they observed an orange-colored, rotating object with a very fast, extremely erratic motion. The saucer stopped at high altitudes, and at times green rays shot out from one side. The saucer stopped at high altitudes, and at times green rays shot out from one side.

A similar type of interference stopped the electromagnetic clocks for 45 minutes at the villa do Porto, near Caldas da Rainha. The witnesses stated that at the same time that a "flying saucer" was circling around in the sky. However, they did not see the actual object because of the cloudiness.

EASLA NG BUT (4506)
FLYING SAUCERS
BY JERRY DUKE, WRITER
ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
ACCORDING TO CAP - SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE 
SEEING MORE IN SUMMER SKIES THAN BUZZING INSECTS AND BIRDS ON
THE GROUND.
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ENGLAND CAFE REPORTS OF FLYING OBJECTS
OBJECTS FLASHING THROUGH SPACE AND SPACE AND INTERFERING
WITH ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, AND TWO ALIENS REMAINING OUTSIDE
THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST
TWO WEEKS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED IN WHAT CAUSED A COWITOTION FROM OHIO TO
MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.
WHAT DO THESE OBJECTS HAVE IN COMMON? NOTHING, SAY SKEPTICS.
ONE MAN IN ENGLAND SAID HIS DAUGHTER'S PLAYING CARDS WERE REPORTED SIGHTINGS
TO DATE SINCE 1947, HE SAYS THEY'RE USUALLY BALLOONS, BIRDS SEARCHLIGHTS,
CHATTERING BATS AND ONCE IN A BLUE MOON, SOME REALLY-LIT OBJECTS BY YOUR NEIGHBORS!
TO DATE  THE AIR FORCE SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED AND
MOST OF THESE APPARENTLY HAVE LOGICAL EXPLANATIONS.A FEW MORE INFORMATION
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATORS LATER
BILLIARD'S SAID HEYSEN HOWEVER HAS ENCOUNTERED CASES WHICH HE SAYS REMAINS
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM OUTER SPACE.
THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND
SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME
ADVANCED CIVILIZATION A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY. THE SAME CONCLUSION YEARS
AGO, BUT ON THIS LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY
WE HAVE ANOTHER SET OF THINGS THEY'RE THAT FAR BEHIND IN EUROPE JULY 7.
IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING," SAID MRS. DORA HORLOCK, WHO, WITH
HER HUSBAND, SPOTTED ONE OF THESE OBJECTS IN THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR
WAR ROCHESTER, ENGLAND.
THAT SAME NIGHT IN VALENSOLE, FRANCE, MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW
THAT LANDED CLOSE BY. HE DESCRIBED IT AS RESEMBLING A LARGE FOOTBALL. 
WITH FOUR METAL LESS AND A DOME. "I DON'T THINK WHAT I SAW WAS EARTHLY,"
HE SAID.
THE OBJECTS THAT WERE SIGHTED, OUR CONSULTANTS SAY, CHANGING TO GREEN AND
YELLOW, CHAPEAU OBJECT-YELLOWISH RED, CHANGING TO GREEN AND YELLOW. AND
ANOTHER FOOTBALL-SHAPED OBJECT RISING EXTREMELY HIGH AND DISAPPEARING "IN
SECONDS." THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING
OBJECT DISAPPEARED OVER THE ISLANDS AND THAT ITS ELECTROMEGNETIC
EFFECTS WERE SUCH THAT IT KNOCKED OUT THEIR RADIO TRANSMITTER.
AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND
OTHER EXPERTS AT OTTAWA AIRPORT OBSERVERS SAID THEY SPOTTED A FLYING OBJECT
GLINTING IN THE SUN NEAR THE AIRPORT AT CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA. IT
WAS ORIGINALLY SO MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AM AR FORCE PLANE
WAS SCRAMBLED TO INVESTIGATE. 
ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT EEYOUTH, MASS. A
RESIDENT SAID HER CHIMNEY CRASHER SAID HER SON, 20, SAID HE
SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE."

OCR output:

Portugal Reports UFO Sightings
Sightings of strange objects through the country continue to baffle the Portuguese weather bureau and the military-observer corps. Descriptions of the objects, which remained stationary and seemed to defy gravit were similar to those reported earlier this month in the Antarctic, where six mysterious flying objects appeared in the northern skies of the U.S. Antarctic station and were seen by the weather bureau-classed interference from one among our electronic equipment such as meteorological rockets. Descriptions of the objects were strikingly similar to official Air Force reports of sightings in Antarctica.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
No

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes. It moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
No.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: (Reddish) white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have not performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Most

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially shows trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

A1SSFO-BALLOONS (250) THE AIR FORCE SAID TODAY A "MYSTERIOUS" SKY OBJECTS, NUMBERING IN THE THOUSANDS IN OHIO AND CANADA LAST WEEK WAS ONE OF THEIR LARGE SKYBORNE MIRROR-COATED BALLOONS. THE BALLOONS, SAID TO BE ABOUT AN OFFICIAL HEIGHT OF 180,000 FEET, ARE USED IN PROJECTS TO TEST ATMOSPHERIC AND COSMIC RAY CONDITIONS.

SGT. DAVID MOODY SAID THAT WEATHER BALLOONS WERE RELEASED JULY 5 BY THE U.S. NAVY AT RICHARDSON BAY, CALIF. FOR COSMIC RAY RESEARCH. THE BALLOONS, ABOUT 60 FEET IN DIAMETER, ARE MISSING AND A SEARCH IS NOW BEING MADE FOR THEM.

MOODY SAID THE BALLOONS NORMALLY FLY AT ABOUT 125,000 FEET AND THAT THEY WOULD BE VISIBLE FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES ON CLEAR DAYS. HE SAID IT IS PROBABLE THAT SOME WERE STILL VISIBLE OVER PENNSYLVANIA, WEST VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND ON MONDAY NIGHT. SOME PERSONS SAID IT APPEARED THAT SOME OF THEM BROKE UP.

SIMILAR SIGHTINGS HAVE OCCURRED IN BRAZIL AND PORTUGAL HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

MOODY SAID THAT A BALLOON WAS RELEASED BY THE NATIONAL COTTON COUNCIL FOR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AT BOLDER, COLO.

HE SAID HIS OFFICE ATTACHED TO NEARBY WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, COULD NOT CONFIRM OR DENY REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECTS OVER CHILE AND AUSTRALIA BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO INVESTIGATE.

SEVERAL PERSONS IN WARMINSTER, ENGLAND, SAID LAST WEDNESDAY THEY SAW A "DISC-SHAPED GLOWING" OBJECT IN THE SKY. IN VALENCIA, SPAIN, A FARMHAND SAID A FOOTBALL SHAPED OBJECT TOOK OFF FROM THE GROUND AND THE ARGENTINE NAVY REPORTED THAT CHILEAN AND BRITISH PERSONNEL IN THE ANTARCTIC SAID THE OBJECT INTERFERED WITH SOME SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS.

SEVERAL PERSONS SAW WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS A "MYSTERIOUS OBJECT" OVER PORTUGAL LAST SATURDAY. PORTUGUESE AERONAUTICAL EXPERTS SAID IT APPEARED TO BE A LONG BALLOON MADE.

Portugal Reports UFO Sightings

LISBON, Portugal (UPI)  Several Portuguese military personnel reported seeing an odd object moving through the skies over Portugal last week.

The first, reported "mysterious object" appeared over the northern city of Oporto, where Manuel Fernandes and his wife saw a bright object in the sky for several minutes.

They reported it looked like a luminous cigar. Several other witnesses in the area also reported the same sighting.

The second incident was reported from the Azores islands, where Jose Viale, a Radio announcer at Ponta Delgada, on the island of Sao Miguel, reported seeing a bright, fast-moving object in the sky for about 10 minutes.

No other details were available on these incidents.

Dear Sir,

Thank you for sending the information on UFOs. I appreciate your reply.

Apparently a week ago while giving the news on a Radio station I came upon a news spot regarding a UFO stopping an Electro-Magnetic clock at the Azores Islands. As you probably know it was sighted by the Weather Bureau there. On the next news I mentioned this and another station in Portugal had an additional information been gathered on this?

Awaiting your reply I am

Sincerely,

On 14 Jul 65 Mr Al Morris called from NEAR he had Mr Vince Lalloy in his office. Lalloy had a news clipping of the Azores, he thinks it was one of his balloons on its second go around. On 23 Jun 65 they launched a couple of unusual super pressures balloons, to check out how stable they are, one was a conventional balloon 10,000 feet, tracked for a few days, another balloon was at around 6500 ft, two balloons tied together, 20 ft long 18 inches in diameter, they were just strapped together, looked like one long cylinder, with payload, if it would have survived it would be at an altitude of 6000 ft.

In order to clarify, would have to find an observer who would say it was long, size of the balloon is not important, the payload should be vertical, can we check this for NEAR. Talky will be flying from New Zealand on a 4project starting in September for 127 nations. He mentioned that the Air Force Cambridge Research Lab is flying things but won't tell.

Should talk to a Tom Kelley 27-6100, ext 3013.

We talked to Cambridge Massachusetts again and they said no they didn't have any classified balloon projects at present and all balloons were accounted for.

VILLA DO PORTO, THE AZORES, JULY 11 (AFP) - THE AZORES WEATHER BUREAU WHILE CHECKING SOME CYLINDRICAL WHITE OBJECTS AT ABOUT 3,500 FEET, AS THEY FLEW OVER VILA DO PORTO SAID THAT THEIR MOTION AND SPEED WAS SIMILAR TO THAT DESCRIBED BY PERSONNEL IN A REPORT BY THE U.S. WEATHER OFFICE SAID:

"THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWARD AT ABOUT 20,000 FEET. THE WEATHER OFFICE SAID.

"LATER, ONE OF THE OBJECTS WAS SIGHTED AT ABOUT 20,000 FEET BY A PILOT OF AN AZORES AIRCRAFT COMPANY WHO SAW THE OBJECT DISAPPEAR BEHIND THE CLOUDS."

THE REPORT CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT "SINCE THERE IS NO INTERFERENCE OF ANY ELECTRICIAN WHO WAS REPAIRING THE SYSTEM, I CANNOT BE STATED THAT THE OBJECT WHICH INTERFERED ELECTRIC CLOCKS IS NOT OF CELESTIAL ORIGIN." 

A SIMILARLY DESCRIBED OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY A COUPLE OVER NORTHERN TERCEIRAL RADA MAR, HEAD OF AN AZORES AIRCRAFT COMPANY WHO SAW THE OBJECT SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR WHICH APPEARED OF A BALLOON-LIKE SHAPE.

ON JULY 16, ANOTHER REPORT SAID LAST WEEK THAT CHILEAN BRITISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION PERSONNEL SAW A GLOWING OBJECT ZIP ACROSS THE SKY IN THE ANTARCTIC. THE ARGENTINE NAVY HAS APPARENTLY FIELD MEASUREMENTS THAT MEASURE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES THAT MAY INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF METALLIC OBJECTS IN THE SKIES.

Mrs. --------- of Dayton, Ohio called on
13 Jul 65 regarding a UFO observation by her and her neighbor.
She was quite confused as to direction, description etc.
It was a silver ring, little white cloud, then it burst into two
objects. Her husband could not see object and wouldn't believe
her. It was either 11 or 12 Jul 65 when she observed object.
Object also had points like a star, then went up and X went
NW, two came out of cloud, shaped like points, then there were two
round objects and dangled around. She saw more than two objects.
Since she was confused Sgt Moody suggested that she fill out an
FTD Form 165. This is agreeable. Form was sent to her on 13 Jul 65.

The field of vision was limited to the actual object as it was observed. This particular object was observeable at a distance of approximately a mile - it was oval in shape and appeared to be a chrome-like or metallic substance. The object remained stationary for about 6-10 minutes, and then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed - being lost to sight in approximately 2 seconds. No sound was noticeable during the observation, nor were there any lights on the object. The basic color of the object was a dull metallic gray.

Buenos Aires sighting 23h02, 3 July. First notification on Tuesday.
R-169 dated 6 July from Santiago, Chile and has time group of 5:32 PM.
Basically said that Argentina and British have reported unusual celestial
body and sending geomagnetic instruments with. Description was yellow
red, varying to green, bluish and zig zag, hovered for awhile. Observation
was confirmed by the Argentina station the following days. Supposedly
object has been seen twice in two weeks. Ten color photographs have been
taken by the Chilean who observed object for 20 minutes. Argentina
said it moved at high speed. Next notification 7 Jul 5:51. R-168
from Santiago, Chile, dispatch time 7:53 PM. The Commander of the Argentina
believed it to be adventurous to call it a flying saucer. It also included
mention that it caused interference in the electromagnetic apparatus. In
a radio interview the Chilean base said it was not a star, nor was it an
earth filled o/s, Commander john said that they did not have the photos
available because they had no means to develop color film. Notification
R-169 said the object was first seen by the British and informed that Argentina
and Chilean bases also observed, stopped in mid air and hovered for few
minutes. Comment was that scientists are skeptical of its extraterrestrial
origin. (Poil that this comment was added by reviewers). Huge Metallic or
an astronomical observer said such phenomena can be explained by physical
appearances in the atmosphere, could be a refraction R-32 from the Buenos
Aires, 7 Jul, dispatched 9:59 AM. Argentina has confirmed

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or memo detailing a report from Major Metsoko regarding UFO sightings from various stations in South America on July 3, 1965. The text describes the sightings, including that the Chilean Commander reported the object as solid with magnetic distortions, traveling fast and hovering. The document also states that photos were taken but will not be available until March 1966, and that the Chilean Commander said it was a classic UFO sighting.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Memo For the Record: On 3 Jul 65 at 0940 hours, Major Metsoko from 1127th Field Activities Group called regarding UFO reports from Santo Domingo, Chile, British and Argentina Stations on a Rosefer Dispatch. (British UPI), R163 and R169, dispatched from Santo Diego 7 Jul at 753 pm. Three stations in Antarctic, Chilean, British and Argentina stations all reporting sighting an object over the horizon. Stations are all fairly far apart from each other. Objs observed on 3 Jul 65.
The Chilean Commander is an Air Force pilot who said the object appeared to be solid, had magnetic distractions, traveled fast, hovered. Speed was such that it was not an aircraft or anything made on earth. Major Metsoko said this was the classic UFO. British and Argentina stations observed it for ten minutes, zig zag overhead, stopped, hovered. They took photos. HOWEVER, THE PHOTOS WILL BE KAVAILABLE, BUT THEN CAN NOT GET THEM OUT UNTIL MARCH 1966. As far as Major Metseko knows the only kind of transmission service is by RADIO TRANSMISSION. They took ten colored photos.
A Santo Diego radio stationhad a radio interview with the Chilean Commander. British said it was not a star.

"Would indicate a rather complicated situation resulting from several objects 
from other parts of the sky not associated with the reported objects. This 
appears to be a not uncommon occurrence and the investigating unit appears to 
have done a commendable job in attempting to unravel the various aspects of the 
sighting as described. The details provided do not permit positive identification 
of the reported objects, but the possibilities considered appear reasonable."

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

Reference:	1. This headquarters memo, 9 July 1965, subject as above.

1. On 9 July 1965, the commanding officer, HQ USAF, directed this office to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the Dayton, Ohio, area on 7 July 1965.

2. The summary of the incident is as follows:

a. At approximately 2100 hours on 7 July 1965, 2Lt John Doe, USAF, was driving his personal vehicle on the Dayton, Ohio, Beltway when he observed an unidentified aerial object hovering over the roadway approximately 500 feet in front of his vehicle. 2Lt Doe stated that the object appeared to be elliptical in shape, approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter, and illuminated by a bright white light. He further stated that the object appeared to have no visible means of propulsion and made no audible noise. 2Lt Doe continued to observe the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

b. 2Lt Doe immediately reported the incident to the Dayton, Ohio, Police Department, who in turn notified the appropriate military authorities.

3. This office has completed its investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident. Based on the information gathered, it is the opinion of this office that the object observed by 2Lt Doe was most likely a weather balloon or some other natural phenomenon, and not an unidentified flying object of extraterrestrial origin. Therefore, this case is considered closed.

The provided image does not contain any photograph. It is a scanned page from a UFO report document that appears to be text-based.

Text output from the document:

On July 15, at 11:50 p.m., I saw something for which I have no explanation. It is difficult to describe because it was quite unlike anything I have seen before. It happened while I was doing some routine chores on the farm on which I live on the outskirts of Montville, Ohio. As I was walking along, I noticed two bright lights appear in the sky over the tree tops which are quite tall pine trees. At first I thought it was a small plane, but I then noticed the lights pasted between two large cherry trees on either side of the driveway. The lights passe between the trees, as if in low-level flight, and only about three to five feet from the ground, as best I can judge. They were about twenty-five or thirty feet apart. Unfortunately, because of the darkness, I could not make out any shape or outline of the object carrying the lights. Soon the lights disappeared behind the trees, and I could hear a sound of a higher pitch than those audible to the human ear. The lights seemed to be about three inches in diameter, and dim at the edges, whereas the centers were quite bright. (Colonel N. M. GRANNIS, Montville, O.). This is only one of the many unpublished things that we are frequently told through our appearance on the Randy Show. Unfortunately, lack of space prevents us from publishing the others at this time.

Data you completed this questionnaire: 7 1 65
Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific police questionnaire or a normal explanation of your sighting:
This object first thought to be an ordinary airplane due to the visible lights which gave the impression of an aircraft in flight. After the object had moved more directly into sight and nearer the observer, it became apparent that the object was not an airplane. It was saucer shaped, giving off a steady bright light, neither blinking nor flashing, and moved at a very high rate of speed, much faster than any jet plane the observer had seen. The object made no sound. It went directly over observer, west to east, and disappeared. Lights went out. Bright light want out.

FLYING SAUCERS ASSOCIATED WITH OF SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY
HENRY RUICK 
WRITER
UFO'S SOME PEOPLE WEAR 
THE WING.
ONE FLYING SAUCER MOVING OVER ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND CAME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBIECTS APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC EQUIPMENT. 
MANY ON BOARD THIS CRAFT CLAIMED CONTACT WITH LIFE INSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST,
BUT NO GLOWING OBIECT THAT CAUSED COMMOTION FROM OHIO TO MARYLAND AND GLANCING HAVE BALLOONIST CLAIMS. 
THE AIR FORCE WHICH HAS LOOKED INTO OVER 12,000 REPORTED SIGHTINGS CANNOT TELL US FOR CERTAIN WHICH HAS BEEN CAUSED BY HALLUCI NATING PEOPLE OR ACTUAL PHEMOMENA.
THE RED AND WHITE KITE SENT UP BY YOUR NEIGHBOR CHILD 
TO PLAY WHICH HAS LOOKED LIKE A DISC IS AN EXAMPLE.
CASE DU/BOIS TOWN COUNCIL SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED OUT OF OVER 12,000 
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATORS AND MORE INFO ON SIGHTINGS WOULD BE EVEN GREATER IF ALL CASES WERE SO THOROUGHLY CHECKED.
ABSOLUTELY FOREVIDANCE IS INDICATIVE OF HAVING SOME RETIRED MARINE PILOT WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INVESTI GATION IS DIRECTOR ON ANALYZING PHENOMENA.
E ASE
THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME KIND OF EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT
LONG AGO I BUT HAS ANOTHER LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTING
RATHER THAN AGGRESSION. THE VERY FRIGHTENING ASPECT 
HOWEVER,
IS THAT ARMY ENGINEERS ENGLAND IN VALENGOLESPE FRANCE MAURICE MASSE SAID
HE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED HIS EXPERT OBJECT WITH OCCUPANTS ON JULY 
THAT THEY DON'T THINK THAT THESE ARE SOVIET OR AMERICAN AIRCRAFT. 
WITH THE OFFICIAL LESSON MILE NEITHER DO THEY THINK THAT THEY ARE FROM THIS EARTH.
WHEN APPROACHED DIRECTLY, THESE STRANGE OBJECTS APPARENTLY SOMETIMES CHANGE TO GREEN LENSE SHAPED OBJECTS YELLOW RED CHANGING DESIGN, MANEUVER, AND DISAPPEAR. 
SEEM: THE VILLA DO PORTO EITHER SAUCER OR A DISK SUCH IN THE
AZORES IT WOULD NOT BE JUST ANOTHER JOB. 
AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS SAID THESE SIGHTINGS COULD NOT BE FROM ANY COUNTRY ON THIS EARTH. 
VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE
JET WAS WITHIN 10 MILES OF IT. ANOTHER SIGHTING OVER WEYMOUTH, MASSACHUSETTS 
WAS REPORTED THE LAST NIGHT AS SAUCER SHAPED OBJECTS IN THE SKY MOVED ERRATICALLY FOR 10 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED.
FOUND LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE.

Landing in France
At 5:00 on the morning of the 1st of November 1954, a farmer of the Valensole region, near Marseille, France, left his home on his tractor to go to his lavender field. When he arrived at the field, he began to see the flowers, then his attention was attracted by an object which seemed to fill the whole countryside. He walked around the object on four metallic feet which was approximately 3.5 meters away. The object had an oblong shape like a big football. 
The farmer describes that the object had a dull, flat, lustrous finish, and had a dome on top of it. The object was poised on four metallic feet "so which was attached to the central block."
What interested Mass was the presence near the machine of a being that appeared to that of an eight-to-ten year old child. The "little man" was working an a orange-colored control box on the object, but was unaware or headless of the farmer's presence. Inside the object, because the small door was open, Mass was able to see the same object inside. The object then took off with a "deafening whistling" sound, the same as had first attracted his attention. Mass witnessed the object ascending at very high speed without any visible sign of smoke or dust. 
Mass informed the authorities at Valensole that the site of the landing was located some 200 meters from his home, a hole of 20 centimeters deep and two meters wide was found in the field where the marks indicated that some thrust or reaction motors had been. The dirt where the central pivot had been was turned around and hardened. The surrounding soil was, however, normal.
Investigations revealed that no normal aircraft had been in the area.

Text extracted from the document:

The Valensole Affair
By Aime Michel

YOU have learned the essential details of the Valensole affair from the excellent text of G.C., who investigated the case on behalf of the C.E.R.O. There are two small details which he does not mention and the fact that M. Masse expressed the meeting across a vineyard, and another experience.

When M. Masse and his son were working in their field near the Valensole plateau, on the 1st of July, an unidentified flying object landed in the middle of the lavender field, about 150 meters from where they were working. Two small beings, about 1 meter in height, came out of the object and approached M. Masse. When they were at a distance of about 30 meters, M. Masse, who was very surprised and somewhat frightened, raised his rifle, which he always carried with him as a matter of precaution, and fired a shot in the air to frighten them away. The beings then returned to the object, which took off immediately and flew away.

M. Masse then went to the place where the object had landed and noticed that the lavender plants had been crushed at that spot, forming a circular area about 5 meters in diameter. The next day, he noticed that the crushed plants had begun to revive.

M. Masse was so shaken by this experience that for several days he could hardly talk about it. It was only after a week that he decided to report the incident to the mayor of Valensole. The mayor in turn informed the Gendarmerie, who came to investigate the case. 

M. Masse had another experience a few days later, which is not unique during the present wave of UFO sightings. As he was working in his field, he suddenly felt a sort of mental compulsion to look up. When he did so, he saw the same object, hovering silently at a great height. The object then shot off at tremendous speed.

In view of all this, I cannot but say that the Valensole case is one of the most impressive on record, not only because of the quality of the witness, but also because of the nature of the facts observed.

As an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

"ordinary Earth men selected from the human species utilized the opportunity their observations and first-hand contact have given them to put themselves on a superhuman level and demand for themselves the right, because of this huminized order to play a part in the history of the solar system. The myths concealed in their contact are also myths connected with their biological manifestations. The numerous descriptions of little men," called by the pad those ufonauts, signify over the pad, and then denote the difficulty that they present to our dignity and to the respect that we have for the human person collective when considering the phenomenon of little men."

The little men" put one in mind of human improbable, according to the view of their utilization in the myths and that there would be much that we could say about them, but one detail must leave no doubt: in all knowledge -and M̲ know and M. Masse has affirmed it to me (falsely, several times before) incredible in their claim to have only good intentions towards us. I am sure."

NO CASE SOURCES

The paper at a certain points on its trajectory? I haven't understood anything at all about what is written in the full document inscription. Persons concerned gave me that information. For example, the legend of the photo is of Bake, Williams, who is said to have been photographed at the age of 16 in an undisclosed place, and the photo was taken by Paul Green. The physical and perhaps explain the fact that the distance covered was more than 100 meters of a trajectory that is unknown or incomprehensible to us means concerning the UFOs would accordingly be inferred. Subsequent observations showed that the object had followed a trajectory of more than 100 meters at low altitude and during the first three days so on the ground was observed at various points, but then suddenly disappeared without a trace. It had not wakened him up to make him see. It then moves with a set speed and then stops, and that its behavior is similar to that of an airborne object, with no memory of any dreams, and agreed that the events described would have been like something out of a science fiction story (August 9).
Since July 5 this watch has been slow. It causes a detachment of the arm and observes that low-flying objects are observing and have been called by witnesses. People have been seeing. He was asked to assist. So I gave the case of a person who said he would have died there and then from shock. The change of the lunar disk is comparable to a time-lapse model of the stuff and the face corresponds to an extraterrestrial. The behavior of the entities was that they were thought to be similar to humans. On the anthropological studies of the matter, the Weldon hypothesis of men from other planets, which is compared to the known features of the human composition and terrestrial sample, leaves a margin of uncertainty.
And that post-hypnotic suggestion. The report conveys only that specific effects on the nerves of his limbs, then he of these would not have been able to change.

Dayton, Ohio 

The proprietor can see that he is upset and does not for a moment assume that his friend Joseph X. Masse is off his head. X. Masse says, "I did not want to say any any more, that nobody would believe him." 
So Masse, who has never been in any sort of trouble, and does not want to have any, tells what he has seen. It all starts with the following: 
"The call proprietor then rushes off to the field, and finds the marks, and this is how it all came about. 
It is at this point or shortly afterwards that the material that of journalism and espionage from the town of Belleville, Mass., becomes important. M. Masse confirms himself to his statements, firm evidence of truthfulness as he has a calm and objective manner far away. Whereas he used to sleep entirely normally before, he is now affected by an insomnia - he cannot sleep daily during the daydately after the incident. 
On the evening of July 14, he went to the spot with his 16-year-old daughter - he saw once again the famous landing legs of the craft. He explains that two of the six legs left their marks on the ground, namely from (a) and (b).
That morning, after the machine had remained muddy there throughout the night, M. Masse finds that there were still some little traces of the mud. In the evening he goes with his daughter and finds near the place where the craft had landed, two holes close to it - he finds that the mud had dried completely."

THE SIGNIFICANT REPORT FROM FRANCE

G. E. P. A. Investigation

In the September/October issue of the FLYING SAUCER REVIEW we gave a bare newspaper account of this classic case from the Haute Alpes district of France. We compressed the story and left out many interesting details. Monsieur A, an electrician from Valensole, France, spotted a strange object on a field near his home at about 5 a.m. on 1 July 1965. This report is an amplification of the facts by our friend G. E. P. A.

M. MASSE was in his lavender field, a little north of Valensole, when his attention was drawn to a strange object resting on the ground about 150 yards from where he stood. This was his customary practice. He had not yet started up the tractor, which had been left parked beside him, and was lighting a cigarette, when he noticed a whirling noise. He looked up and saw the object, which turned out to be a sort of bell, resting on the ground, which had been concealing him and on which it settled down just beside him.

The object, M. Masse says, was about 5 metres (15 feet) in diameter, and in colour a sort of greenish-silvery hue. It seemed to him to be made of a sort of dull metal or alloy. At one side of the base of the bell-shaped object were three stumpy legs, about half a meter long, which supported the whole structure at about two feet off the ground. M. Masse goes on to say that he realized that this could not be one. He was confronted with a strange craft, which he estimated to be about 40 feet in circumference.

He was about to make some move when he noticed at a distance of about 40 yards, a little to one side of the machine, two strange human-like beings, standing motionless, gazing at him. He never fails each time to go over and over in his mind the picture which are very frequently recalled. These two figures seemed to him to be about 5 feet in height – they were slim and wore what appeared to be close-fitting suits resembling a big rugby ball, the size of an ordinary car, and standing on a platform the shape of saucers. they themselves gave M. Masse the impression of being there with the machine, though he goes on walking calmly towards it all the time, as if under some strong attraction.

As M. Masse got about 25 yards from the machine, these two men, or "humanoid," as he calls them, turned towards him, and one of them raised an arm, which seemed to have no elbow, in a gesture as though to stop him. M. Masse says that he was conscious of a sort of uncomfortable feeling, as though he was being observed and studied by these two men, who appeared intent on deterring him from approaching them. And thus he reaches a point five or six yards from the strange visitors, but these two who he at once points a sort of tube or "pistol" at him, which he interprets as directed to his movement. Could they have called out? To my question, he answered that he had not thought of that at the time. He was too astonished, too paralysed, to be able to do or say.

He can still at the moment describe what is going on around him. These two strange humanoid have no face in the sense of eyes, nose, or mouth – there is only a black visor, which gives them a sinister, inhuman appearance. The tube or "pistol" which one of them is holding on M. Masse is perhaps about 40 cm long. It is directed at him, and M. Masse has the feeling that if he makes one wrong move, so to speak, it will go off. The other humanoid stands motionless, but the one with the tube (or "pistol") makes a slight downward movement, as though to indicate that M. Masse must remain where he is.

M. Masse thought then that he was going to be seized, to be the subject of some sort of experiment, and he became aware that the whole incident had lasted, from the moment when he first saw the "machine" until now, a quarter of an hour. The use of his limbs seems to him to be paralysed, and he has the impression of a strange emanation or force or field enveloping him. He dare not move, so great is his fear. He thinks of his wife and children at home, and he would like to call out, but some inner force prevents him. 

He subsequently relates that the relative of M. Masse are explicit on this point: the door not coming when he has failed to return home at the usual time. Here he remains motionless, and goes on gazing at these strange visitors, petrified with fear. He tells him the machine that landed in his field, the one the two humanoid seem to belong to, does not make a noise, give off smoke, or produce any vapour or exhaust – it sits there silently.

SAUCER HOVERS OVER CAR IN WASHINGTON STATE: A JULY 2nd INCIDENT.
Appearing was not expected to the press at all. Mrs. A. told Brundage, who had a terribly unnerving experience driving alone along a lonely road in mid-August: Something is about midget for car. Then she saw a glowing object hovering right over her hood. the object remained in the sky, beginning slowly. Mrs. A. was a Brundage said the object seemed to be a gigantic version of a child's toy. It was about 25 wide as the mobile. After about two minutes, the object made a sort of "dipping" motion and swept over the trees to her left, out of sight. She saw then the ordinary little ground shapes she had seen all along that day. The battery in her car went dead a moment or two later, lasting only until the next day to be two minutes slow - indicating that it had stopped during the period of time the UFO was at close range. Mrs. Brundage was so frightened by the encounter that she has refused to drive alone over that stretch of road at night any more.

"two stopped. The objects had now formed an equilateral triangle. they seemed to have changed in size to, observe them when we went into the dense trees around down. When visible,the objects had been in a position about 25 degrees from horizon. I had expected these to be strung out in a line, but they appeared to be in the general flight pattern for missiles. It was obvious they were not airplanes. I don't think it was a balloon, the way they acted.Allowed

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I am on fifteen and quite interested in these "U.F.O.'s" in a way. There are two incidents that I witnessed, along with others, that might interest you. These incidents occurred near Slidell, Louisiana, or 10 miles N.E. of New Orleans,in the summer of 1965. I think I believe these are of importance because both observed within a few miles of the Marshall Space Flight Center at Michoud in New Orleans, the computer center in Slidell, and the Mississippi Test Facility 15 miles north of Slidell.

The first incident occurred in the summer at about 9:00 P.M. We spotted over Boy Scout Camp Salmen traveling west to east. The object was estimated to be traveling at a speed of about 40 degrees above the western horizon, was in sight for about half an hour, then disappeared in the east about 40 or 45 degrees above the horizon. Some of us remarked at the time that the movements did not seem natural, almost like a balloon. The object was equal in size and brilliance to a star.

The second sighting I observed was E.S.E. of Slidell in a marshy near an inlet into Lake Pontchartrain called the Rigolets. We were in our car traveling west on a two mile stretch of roadway through the marshland. In this area it is quite dark and a good place to observe things. As I was looking out the car window when I noticed a star of the second magnitude more to the S.W. to the N.E. The star was moving about 6 squares per minute. It appeared much brighter and seemed to grow in size. I observed it intensively for 20 seconds during which time it stopped and stood still like the surrounding stars. 5 seconds or so later I saw another object of equal brightness and size. This one was coming from the same direction and seemed glowing and oscillating. It stopped about 1/4 inch from the first star. This movement seemed to disappear. After the second star had stopped a brilliant red object had stopped a few inches from the second star. I observed this for several minutes, from the N.W. at the same speed, brightness, etc. of the first star.

The text mentions that the object was observed by three separate stations in Argentina, Britain, and Chile, and was predominantly red and green in color with yellow, blue, orange, and white reflectors. The observers were able to take ten photographs of the object. The text also mentions that the object affected instruments used for measuring magnetic fields. No further information about any photographs is provided in the text.

Extract from message on sighting:
A UFO was sighted on 3 July at 23:02 in the Antarctic by three separate stations, Argentina, British and Chileean. The object was observed about forty-five degrees above the horizon heading east at an estimated distance of six to eight miles. The UFO was predominantly red and green in color with yellow, blue, orange, and white reflectors and was visible for 15 to 20 minutes; sixteen or more chileans observed the sighting and were able to take ten photographs, the Argentines also photographed the object and provided the Air Attache copies of the photography. The argentine station at Orcadas Del Sur reported that the object affected instruments used for measuring magnetic fields. Additional information will follow when available.

JULY-AUGUST, 1965 	THE A.P.R.O. BULLETIN

Antarctica...
(Continued from page 1)
While several hundred yards from the base, the object was moving on a zig-zagging trajectory toward the east. Its speed was that of several hundred miles per hour, and it passed at an elevation of 45 degrees over the horizon. The base personnel reported that it performed maneuvers which they described as being of tremendous speeds and altitudes for that time of year. During its maneuver, the object reached an estimated altitude of about 5 thousand meters. The meteorological conditions for the summer at that time of year were good: a clear sky, some stratocumulus, minor winds.
"The sighting was witnessed by the meteorological officer with 13 persons visiting the base. The observation lasted for 30 minutes and photographs of the object were taken."
"In the afternoon of the same day the same object was observed from the Argentine naval station moving away toward the north-east. The distance estimated was about 50 kilometers. The Chilean base also observed the object on the afternoon of that same day." Unusual Occurrence in the South Atlantic

"Any islands in the South Atlantic as the closest observatory in the Atlantic, indicate that there is evidence of unusual magnetic disturbances. Several terrestrial magnetism are obtained there, several instruments, magnetometers Kew and terrestrial inductors Schuster. The passage of the object was detected over the area. A great agitation and disturbances have been observed in these instruments because the presence of the strange objects in the sky. The technical conditions were excellent for observation - recorded on the magnetographic tapes according to the authorized statement of the meteorologist."

"The observer could follow the phenomenon visually observation for 60 minutes while the instruments recorded the disturbances for about one hour and two minutes. According to the same meteorologist, the disturbances have no natural explanation and could not classified in present system of meteorological parameters."

On July 6, the Argentine Navy Secret Patrol disclosed a second official report to

confirm the previous information on the sighting of an unidentified aerial object in the skies of the Antartic region. This "Contacts were made with the Commander of the Navy station on Deception Island, Daniel Perisé, confirmed the accuracy of his first report explaining that the sighting was observed by all the personnel under his command. He again affirmed that the apparent magnitude was, moving to the east with sudden accelerations and changes in course. The characteristics of the object, according to the information that it was not a star, a weather balloon or an airplane. Reverberations of the radar equipment on the base, including three Chilean subordinates from the Kruskov base, who were on Deception Island, had observed the object and needed medical care.

"Corresponding to attempts to photograph the object, the technicians affirmed that the circumstances were not favorable, due to low sensitivity of the film used, the distance and the darkness at the time of the sighting."

"On the other hand, information from the Navy station at South Georgia Is. is also of importance: during the passage of the object over that island, various disturbances in the magnetic field were recorded on their tapes."

The Chilean Report

The Ministry of Defense of Santiago, Chile, released to the press on July 2 a report on the observations of an unidentified aerial object, made by Commander Mario Jahn Barrera, the C.O. at that Base located at Deception Island.

The report states as follows:

"At 16:00 hrs. today, at 64.00 S., 60.40 W., an unidentified luminous object was observed by all the garrison. Avello 16:40 40Z:.*Unique."

The text describes an sighting and observations made by various individuals, as well as the analysis and opinions of scientists regarding the object.

SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — A communique issued at Santiago said a mysterious lens-shaped flying object was observed in the Antarctic area Ja uary 25-27.

The object, it was said, maneuvered at altitude of about 5,000 to 10,000 feet and made no noise. It traveled at a speed estimated at 1,500 to 2,000 miles per hour. The object was seen by scientists at the Chilean, United States and British Antarctic bases, the communique stated.

According to the communique, Commander Pedro Aguirre Cerda of the Chilean Air Force said the object was observed through telescopes and that it would be too much to say that it was a spacecraft.

The scientists in Antarctica see and photograph UFOs on July 3rd. They reported that the object moved around in the sky for nearly minutes, changing colors. The object caused interference in the electronic equipment.

FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED IN ANTARCTIC
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - From the Antarctic yesterday came official reports that a flying object, described as "something real", was sighted by the crew of a Chilean base.
A Chilean base commander in the Antarctic reported the object was "something real, something in the sky", said it was a high-speed object, "glowing with a reddish orange light", and that it moved without sound.
In Buenos Aires, the navy reported the object was seen by two Argentine and two British base commanders near the Argentine base on Deception Island, east of the southern tip of South America.
The report said the object moved swiftly and silently, disappearing within minutes. Details were scarce, the navy said.

Australia "Visited" in March
Eight lights, each with long, red, incandescent tails about 20 times the length of the head of the lights, were observed by persons at the Wollongong Observatory in New South Wales on March 3, 1965. Radio stations and newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from persons claiming they saw the lights over New South Wales. All reports said the sightings were from northeast to southwest at 7:15 and 8 p.m. The Civil Aviation Agency and the Royal Australian Air Force said the lights were in the area where the sightings were made.
The Wollongong Observatory saw the objects directly overhead as they passed their regional weekly meeting at the observatory, according to Director Gordon.
Some of the astronomers theorized the sighting "may have resulted from moving the Australian deep space tracking station," Professor Bart Bok, Director of the Mt. Stromlo Observatory, read a small statement about meteorites to the press.

Antarctica -- (Continued from page 3)
Many months ago, a strange light and maneuver caused interference in the electro-magnetic instruments of the Argentine base station on the Argentine islands. Its red-yellow colour changed to green and orange. It was flying at a relatively low altitude of 45 degrees, over the north of the islands, and moving in a zigzagging course.  
It hovered in mid-air after performing some of its maneuvers, remaining motionless for about 20 minutes and then moving away at high speed. We observed the high-power binoculars and theodolites. It don't believe it could be an airship or a terrestrial manufacture. As an officer of the Chilean Air Force, my knowledge about unmanned machines gives me the conviction that nothing similar exists on earth in shape, velocity and mobility in more "We have taken photographs which will be developed in Santiago.
"As soon as we sighted the object we tried to contact the Argentine and English bases. But such contact was impossible because there was a very strong interference on the radio channels. With the radio useless and under intense emotion we continued to watch the thing in space, on a clear night without winds..." Unquote.

UFO INVESTIGATOR

Chile, Argentina Confirm UFO Films

In official public statements, authorities in Chile and Argentina have solidly confirmed clear UFO color pictures taken at their Antarctic scientific stations. Adding to earlier press stories, the authorities of these Argentine and Chilean claims detail further that these strange aerial objects were photographed over a period of many months at several of their Antarctic stations.

Daniel Perisse, C.O., confirmed by radio in the Antarctic, U that these large (50-70 feet in diameter) UFO sighted by many observers through binoculars. The unknown object caused strong interference with their scientific instruments to such an extent that all ordinary photography had to be terminated in the area. Other pictures were taken through a theodolite by a member of a visiting group from the Chilean Antarctic expedition. The Chilean Minister of Defense at Santiago added new information relayed by CAR. Mario Juan Barrera, C.O. of the Chilean Navy. On July 15-18, they had encountered a group of five bright, shiny lens-shaped objects which were watched for a considerable time by all air. During this July 15 sighting, the strange objects had caused strong radio interference, temporarily blacking out their attempts to report the UFO to nearby stations.

Two bright disk-shaped objects which were photographed over Buenos Aires on the night of July 16 were seen by many witnesses. A glowing UFO photographed near Sherman, Texas, August 2, 1964, was acknowledged by a newspaper photographer as having been the UFO. (This film supports the Air Force explanation of the Cisco Grove, Aug. 6, 1964 case seen over Texas.)

Last May, air-to-ground pictures, taken by highway accident investigator near Santa Ana on August 3 in Orange County, California, were given to the NICAP. A similar air-to-air picture, taken by Arjan Adema, winner of the 1963-64 Menchenhaus award, was presented by the Inter-American Photographic Society recently in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It shows an unidentified object high in the sky over Chili, and photographed by a news photographer of the Santiago Mercurio.

Dear Hayden:

The following comments apply to the reported sighting by one of your NICAP correspondents on 26 July 1952 at 1700 hours, which you requested be considered as part of the official Air Force case file.

The duration of twenty-eight minutes was very confusing. The object(s) were described as round and square, which seemed logical from the general description, followed by an estimate that the object had vanished and reappeared in this sequence.

I have checked the ECHO schedule for San Antonio, Texas as of that date and observed no records indicating the sighting of any object. The reported stopping of the object which you mentioned with identifiable conditions or an illusion created by the passage of one or more cloud layers does not clarify the reported observations.

The only object with similar appearance to the satellite was the Moon, which at the time of the reported incident appears to have been the only celestial body in the area capable of being observed. The reported disappearance did not exceed ten minutes and the report does not support the concept of an unconventional aerial object.

Transcription of the text from the document:

July 9, 1965

This case is an exception in that the sighting was practically "point blank" range. The light seemed to be hovering and was so bright that it was easily visible even in daylight.

At the time I was driving on Ohio route 444, approximately 3 miles north of Dayton, Ohio. The light was hovering over a wooded area to the west of the highway. It seemed to be about 500-1000 feet in the air and about 1/4 mile away from the highway.

The light was brilliant white in color and appeared to be about 15-20 feet in diameter. There was a thin dark line across the center of the light which may have been the edge of the object itself. The light did not seem to be rotating or pulsing, but remained steady.

I observed the light for about 3 to 5 minutes before it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from view. I had the impression that the light was under intelligent control and that it became aware of my observation and quickly departed.

I have no reason to disbelieve the reality of this sighting. The light was so bright and close that it could hardly have been any conventional aircraft or other explainable phenomenon. The suddenness and speed of its departure also seems inconsistent with any known type of aircraft.
