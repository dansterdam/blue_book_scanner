There is no photograph contained in the image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a record of the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text in the document reads as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear [Redacted],

Reference is made to your letter of 17 May 1961, in which you inquire about a report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) observed in your area on 8 May 1961.

The description sounds very much like what is known as a bolide, or a very bright meteor. Your description of its almost instant disappearance is typical of a bolide, which burns up completely in the earth's atmosphere and leaves no remnants. Such occurrences are common and are usually explainable as natural phenomena.

If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document, containing instructions and questions for observers regarding the description of unidentified flying objects.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, or "XX" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? 

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
