1. Forwarded is a copy of a police report from the Honolulu Police Department and an extract from the Base Disaster Control Division, APO 915, describing a UFO incident.

2. My own investigation made during the evening of 14 February 1964 revealed no unusual weather phenomena, no aircraft flying in the area in question during the time involved, no army activities in the adjacent military reservation and no disruption of power lines, etc. The sound was confirmed by Army S/A Kiley who told me he heard the sound through the telephone when Mrs. first called him.

3. The area in question is in the foot hills of the mountains, north of Honolulu. The neighborhood is characterized by small hills and valley, leading back several miles to the mountains. A highway runs through this area like a corridor.

4. I did find there was an accident on Likelike highway near where this incident occurred. The evening in question was also the last night of celebration of Chinese New Year.

Transcribing the text from the document:

5. This matter was discussed with Major Earl J. Wolf Jr., FTD Liaison Officer, Hq PACAF. He suggested that since a condition of certain and/or weather temperature conditions, the sound was a reverberation of noises from police sirens going to the nearby accident. Since the visual observations reported to the military and civil authorities were vague - this suggestion would appear to be the most valid to date.

OCR Text Output:

COULD BE SPACE VEHICLE OR THE SOUND IS LIKE A SOUND COMING FROM A SPACE VEHICLE OVERHEAD
As I stated over head, or the sound from a space object that is seen overhead.
Cornpassmn, after hearing this sound that was described for quite a while, and then a lull in the sound, it suddenly resumed. The sound was described as being somewhat bizarre, but the military service was notified and indicated that this incident was in the order of routine, and there wasn't anything to it that was to be alarmed about. However, I do too ascertain that the person who had heard this unusual sound was quite disturbed by it and he too had heard that strange sound. As you told them the sound, they all seem to recognize that, and spoke to the unusual and undescribable noise.
This sound, gave them the impression as if this object was wanting to land or performance manner. However, is none.
INVESTIGATION: For more witnesses to this case, please advise the Commanding
Officer, _______________ Air Base, to interview any other members of the
household who may have heard or seen this object. If any other witnesses can
be located, such as neighbors, please request that they also be interviewed
regarding this incident and describe in detail the sound of this object.
It is requested that any additional information or data be furnished this
office as soon as possible.
