Two Report Seeing UFOs
Two unidentified flying objects over the Daytona Beach area were witnessed by two residents of the Holly Hill area, Thursday, December 8th, at 9:15 p.m.
Mike Pruitt, living at 218 Evergreen Drive, and Mrs. J. B. Gilbert, living at 222 Evergreen Drive, first noticed the objects hovering near their homes. They called to other members of their families to witness the phenomenon.
Pruitt reported that the two objects were hovering about 75 feet off the ground, approximately 200 yards from their home. He said they were about 15 feet in diameter and resembled two silver dollars one on top of the other. Pruitt said they hovered for about five minutes, then one of the objects shot straight up into the sky at a speed he estimated at 500 mph. The other object then made a wide turn and joined the first one as it accelerated out of sight.
Pruitt said when the objects first appeared, there was a brilliant bluish-white glow about them. This glow, he said, soon diminished. He said the objects were higher than the roof tops of the houses in the area. The two witnesses said the objects made no sound at all.
Mrs. Gilbert, who lives next door to Pruitt, corroborated his story. She said she saw the two objects at the same time Pruitt did and they behaved in the same manner as he described.
