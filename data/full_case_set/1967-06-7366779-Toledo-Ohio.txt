Major Dinsdale,

This is the report a sighting of Friday night, may be of interest to Air Force at Toledo Ohio and all from Sandvasky must the same night at about 11:00 A.M.

The first on the scene was a man by the name of Jim Tilly, a milk plant operator and his wife, the children asleep in the back. The observe the object hovering and at a sudden rise and rush to the south at a speed that was incredible, the others in a neighboring farm house saw the same thing.

The object was seen by at least 3 other witnesses in the vicinity and described as a brilliant light, elliptical in shape, hovering a few hundred feet off the ground and then suddenly accelerating forward and out of sight, and it required a clean bright day light this evening but we could not recall to be seen again at that time. I could see the object or whatever it was from my place and I felt there was something out of the ordinary and I'm sure Jim Tilly and his wife and a neighboring family would agree with me on this.

We would like very much if anyone in your Department has any information on this strange incident.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and a compass diagram. The sketch depicts an object in the sky, with instructions to draw its motion and show any changes in direction during the course. The compass diagram appears to be a reference for the observer to determine the position of the object relative to the horizon.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" at the highest point where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
