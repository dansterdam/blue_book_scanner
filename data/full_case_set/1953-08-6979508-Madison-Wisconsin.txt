AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Sighting of an Unidentified Object
From Chippewa to Madison, Wisconsin
DATE OF REPORT: 15 August 1953
PREPARED BY (OFFICER): Charles W. Youngson 1/Lt. USAF
REFERENCES (toward number, division, previous report, etc, as applicable): 
SUMMARY: (Concise statement of essential facts without unnecessary detail):
Interrogation of Mrs. & Mrs. Gilrider, age 35, and Mr. Gilrider, [REDACTED], who observed the sighting of an unidentified object at 2043 CST, 15 August 1953.

Mr. and Mrs. Gilrider were driving north on Highway #14 approximately 15 miles from Madison, Wisconsin. The object was first observed as a reddish color or glow like a bright light on a high tower. Mrs. Gilrider immediately called her husband's attention to the object. As they both watched, the object seemed to move slowly downwards, then upwards, then move directly in front of the car and appeared to change color from the reddish to an orange color and then to the original reddish color. The object appeared to have no trail or exhaust effect. As the object appeared to move closer, it seemed to have a tail or trail effect. The object continued under observation for approximately 5 minutes and then appeared to move away to the north at a high rate of speed.

It is estimated the object to be at an altitude of 5,000 to 8,000 feet. The object appeared to have a sharp definite outline and did not appear to change in size as it moved away. The object appeared to come closer to the earth, but it did not appear any larger.

The object was constantly under observation from the time of first sighting until it disappeared from sight approximately 2.000 CPT. When Mr. and Mrs. Berrick retired for the night the object was still visible.

Mrs. Gilrider is a housewife with several years experience as a Secretary at the University of Wisconsin.

Mr. Gilrider served in the Air Force during World War II as a [REDACTED].
