SUBJECT: Report from Space Data Officers Report 

TO: 3350th MOVEMENT SQUADRON
The following was reported by the Space Data Officer's Project
for the period 1 September 1965 through 30 September 1965:

On Monday, 27 September 1965, at approximately 1630 hours, the Space Data Officer observed a bright metallic unidentified flying object through the northern window of the Space Systems Division Headquarters building at Los Angeles Air Force Station, California. The object was approximately 2,000 feet in altitude, and was moving in a straight line at a high rate of speed on a heading of approximately 030 degrees. The object was clearly seen against a clear blue sky and was observed for approximately 60 seconds before passing out of sight.

This sighting coincides with numerous other UFO sightings reported to the Space Data Officer during the period covered by this report. The object was of a metallic-appearing condition, was round in shape, and displayed no visible means of propulsion. The object appeared to be surrounded by a hazy metallic aura, but no distinct details could be observed.

The above information is submitted for your information and appropriate action.

Director of Space Systems Division
