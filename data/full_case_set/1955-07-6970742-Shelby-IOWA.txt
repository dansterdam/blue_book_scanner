REPORT NO. 2A-UFOB-2-55   PART ONE
PAGE 2 OF 4 PAGES

I. SOURCE:
Address: Shelby, Iowa
Occupation: Cashier, Farmer's Savings Bank, Shelby, Iowa.
Qualifications: "Good Fort Supervisor"

II. RELIABILITY:
Not possible to judge from information available.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
Source noticed flashing lights in sky "north east" to south. Lights appeared to be hovering and, when the source attempted to point them out, they would disappear. A round, shadowy white beam coming towards a point would show below the object. At 30/0852 the object was observed with the same characteristics. The northward. The size of the first object appeared to be that of a "pea" observed at arm's length. The object did not change orientation through 7 power binoculars. Horizontal movement but not vertical. Wind was estimated 30 knots from 110 degrees. Pictures of the object (See Incl. 1) were taken with an 8mm Compro lens camera Rafix: 1 Compo single picture type, f20.

REPORT NO. 2-A-UFOB-2-55 PART TWO PAGE 3
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. Upon assignment to Detachment 2 for investigation Capt Bischof began to conduct the investigation, however, he was unable to develop any leads. The investigation was then turned over to Maj General Garry and this initial report and photographs had been prepared.
2. Checking with research agencies in this area revealed that there were no balloons from Minneapolis over Iowa at the time. Also the lights carried on balloons are generally white or possibly red and white twinkling.
3. At 30/07/32 July 55 a B-25 type aircraft, AF#51710, passed within five (5) miles of the object and was asked by the ADDC if they could see the object. The pilot reported he could not see it.
4. When the film was developed by the 5148 Material Sqdn Photo Lab nothing showed. (See Part One, Incl 1)
5. It is believed that Hoby Dick balloons carry only a white light.
6. The U. of Minnesota Observatory said that there was nothing astronomical that would cause such a sighting on that night.

REPORT NO. 2A-UFOB-2-55 PART THREE 
PAGE 4 OF 4

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was possibly caused by an airplane, for the following reasons:

a. The color of the lights and their flashing would be those of an aircraft.
b. The lack of motion could be explained by wind or by a helicopter or a convertiplane.  
c. The description of the white lights sounds like landing or maybe search-lights.
d. Investigation discovered no balloon or astronomical activity that would account for the sighting.

WALTER E. SAMPSON
2/14/55  USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. - This headquarters does not agree with the possibility of an aircraft generated sighting as set forth by the Preparing Officer for the following reasons:

a. The duration of the sighting was too long for that of an aircraft.
b. The object appeared to remain motionless for more than two and one-half hours.
c. This headquarters offers the hypothesis that this sighting was possibly caused by a balloon for the following reasons:
d. The object remained high and motionless for a long period of time.
e. Viewing of ordinary white light through low power optical instruments such as binoculars used can induce colors which object does not actually possess.
f. Balloons of the rawindsonde type, released from Air Force Weather Stations and detachments thereof daily, can be seen after dark up to an altitude of forty thousand feet without visual side.
g. The revolving of the balloon or oscillation of the suspension train (carrying the modulator units), caused by wind currents, could account for the flashing lights and the beams of light which at times came from the object.
