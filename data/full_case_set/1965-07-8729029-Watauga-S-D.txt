The image does not contain any photographs, only text. Here is the OCR output of the text in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? One of the objects seemed to disappear while we were parked on the highway. At first we were watching two objects, but suddenly one of them disappeared and we only saw the other one after we passed Rapid City, North Dakota.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): YES    NO    Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what:
In my mind, An object before the one object disappeared into a cloud bank for a short period of time.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES    NO    Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what:
The object could be seen again after passing through a cloud bank.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound: None
b. Color: no specific color except that shown by a bright light
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
It would guess that a largest hole of light would have shown around the match head.
19. Of the picture you will show the shape of the object of objects. Label and include in your sketch any details plus some description of the color, size, rotations, etc., and especially show the trail that the object left. The objects were round in shape about the size of a basketball, moving silently and straight up, straight down, to the northwest, southeast and straight the object remained stationary, hovering for a moment, then moving in a roundabout direction. On one occasion while we were parked and watching the objects moved in on each other and as they neared each other seemed to bounce.

Text from the document:

20. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object? (Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate? _____________________

21. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was traveling when you first sighted it? (Circle One) Yes No

24. IF you were MOVING IN AN AUTOMOBILE or other vehicle at the time, then complete the following questions:
24.1 What direction were you moving? (Circle One) a. North b. East c. South d. Southwest
24.2 How fast were you moving? _______ miles per hour.
24.3 Did you stop at any time while you were looking at the object? (Circle One) Yes No

g. Other _____________

26. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. There are no structures visible to the object listed on the last page.

The image contains no photograph, only sketches and text. The text in the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. This would be difficult to sketch as the objects moved in so many directions.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Two. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. This again would be difficult to sketch due to the length of time observed and various positions that when first sighted they were positioned as follows:

I believe the higher object was the one we kept in sight the longest.

The text that can be extracted from the document is as follows:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location. If we have seen the 2010 satellite from our Vanguard Juno IV, about 1961. We have also seen other objects since, I will explain these under item 35.

ADDRESS: [REDACTED] Street [REDACTED] City [REDACTED] Zone [REDACTED] State 
TELEPHONE NUMBER: [REDACTED]
AGE: 48 at the time SEX: Male
I am a retired Aviation Guidance Chief. It is very difficult for me to distinguish objects that would be difficult to distingtigh visually at a considerable distance and have been an interviewer for the North Dakota Game and Fish Department since 11/27/61.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? To officials at Air Force Detachment 20, 21st Reg, Minot, N. Dak. who forwarded my report to an officer at the Minot Air Force Base, N. Dak.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 23 March 1965
35. Information which you feel is pertinent and is not covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: We had an object pass over our former home in Nicasio, California. The object did not appear to be as large or as bright as the object witnessed by Mack and his children. I would size that while ascending the objects travelled several thousand feet in space of a few seconds. This is the reason for the short duration of ours, between one and 1000 feet of each other. 
On several occasions during the months of August and September 1965, my family and I have sighted similar objects travelling at a set rate of speed from south to north and return. Some were called "Taget Radar" seen manned by the Air Force north of Bismarck and they did not appear to be satellites or planets. These objects were sighted on all occasions these objects passed, whether they were aircraft or balloons. All were sighted at night. I believe the objects of this nature are probably more numerous than indicated during the following months.

NOTE: J. Allen Hynek has requested additional information from me, if it is not given specifically, I would appreciate it if you would furnish this report to Hynek. Hynek is the Scientific Consultant for the Air Force's project Bluebook.
