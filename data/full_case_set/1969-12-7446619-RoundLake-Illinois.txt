Yes. it moved out of sight rapidly - I could not keep track of it.

Yes. If you answered YES, then tell what.
It moved behind some haze or fog, then reappeared.

Note the apparent size of the object in relation to the length of the match or pencil, and the speed of the object across your field of vision in relation to the match or pencil. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the match or pencil would the object have covered, and how fast would it have moved in relation to the match or pencil?
The object was about 1/3 the length of a match stick held at arm's length, and it moved across the field of vision about as fast as the match stick moved when waved back and forth slowly.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I had been very interested about the "Flyers" and what I had heard around town about them seeing a strange object over Round Lake on this date. I was out scouting around that evening and noticed what was at first an unusual bright light in the sky. It seemed to be moving towards me and getting larger, although it did not appear to be a plane or other aircraft that I was familiar with. As the object came closer, I could see that it was a large saucer-shaped craft, completely silent, with reddish-orange lights around the edge. At one point it appeared to stop and hover, and then it accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. I was quite amazed and baffled by what I had seen, as it did not seem to be any kind of conventional aircraft. I have no explanation for what it was, but I am confident that it was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything else I have seen before. It was a very unusual and unexplained sighting.

In report, the observer stated that he saw an object in the sky as the left on the ground. He described the object as being approximately 15 feet in diameter and having the shape of an inverted bowl. The object appeared to be glowing with a bright light and was hovering around 15 feet above the ground. He observed it for approximately 2-3 minutes before it silently moved away and disappeared from sight. No sounds or odors were reported in association with the object. The observer could not estimate the distance to the object but reported that it was hovering approximately 200 yards from his location. No other witnesses were reported. The observer did not attempt to approach the object or take any photographs. The report indicates that the object was witnessed at around 10:00 PM on the night of the observation.
