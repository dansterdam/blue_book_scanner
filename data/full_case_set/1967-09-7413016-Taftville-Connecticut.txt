The text extracted from the document is as follows:

DATE - TIME GROUP: 17 AUG 67 1720Z
2. LOCATION: Taftville, Connecticut
3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 Minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: E-SE
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Yes
COMMENTS: The observer, a large fluorescent light in the sky. The object was stationary and slowly moving at other times. The object apparently hovered and gave the appearance of having a dull side. The windows completely separated but very close to each other. There was no noise at all and lights suddenly went out and the whole object disappeared.

COMMENTS: The observer's wife and her mother had seen the object a few weeks ago. This statement conflicts with the description itself, which is consistent with that of an aircraft. However, the sighting has not been re-evaluated in the light of this data, since it was not reported to the Air Force within 30 days and was therefore too old to investigate.

Dear Sir:
I am a student in the eighth grade and interested in UFOs.
I became especially interested when one night a few weeks ago, my mother and I witnessed a large (size of dinner plate) fluorescent looking object in the sky. The object was stationary and moving slowly at other times. We among other people observed it for at least ten minutes hovering in the sky. The object apparently turned and gave the appearance of having two windows, completely separated but very close to each other. As we had stepped out of the car we noticed no noise at all. The lights on it suddenly went out and the whole object disappeared. As we live in a rural area there were no other lights around so we could not be mistaken.
I understand that you put out some literature ( Project Bluebook) every February. Would you please send me the latest edition as I already have the one from 1966. Would you please send me the latest you have? I Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
