Dear Mrs. ______

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your un-
identified flying object report of 12 December 1957 and
the 8mm motion picture film you submitted to support
this sighting. I am returning your film herewith.

A careful analysis of the precise data submitted

Venus.

For your information I am enclosing a copy of the
latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet, dated 5 November
1957, on unidentified flying objects, together with copies
of December 1957 news clippings emphasizing the seasonal
brilliance of Venus at that time.

Sincerely,
