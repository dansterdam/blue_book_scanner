The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text describes an incident in Clarksville, Tennessee, where the witness reported a sound resembling that of a helicopter, but no visual confirmation of an aircraft was made. The document discusses the possibility that the object could have been an unauthorized helicopter, a dirigible, or an experimental device.

The text of the document is as follows:

directly over his home in Clarksville. The sound resembled that of a helicopter, but when the object sought could be found none could be seen. The account of this witness was related in the ATIC Form by the original source. 6. Original source stated that the object could have been an unauthorized helicopter from Ft. Campbell, a dirigible in the area, or an experimental device of some sort.

In light of the above information, evaluation of this HQE is possibly aircraft (helicopter).

10. SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Quite a bright red object, the size of a baseball, was observed by a radar operator at ground level. Object was traveling at a high rate of speed and had an unfamiliar sound. Object hovered for a while, then disappeared in a flash. Due to the distance from the observer to the object, no other details could be obtained. However, this UFOB sent ATIC forms 112 to process information on such objects. (Contains on back)

The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The text on the image describes an analysis of a UFO sighting, including details about the object's appearance, movement, and duration of the sighting.

Analysis of the returned ATIC forms and the AF Form 112 indicates the following:
1. The 09/10/1952 sighting was not reported by sources in the ATIC forms. (Several copies of the 02/13/53 form were sent to complete a report for each sighting.)
2. The ATIC Form 14 description of the 11/02/31 sighting indicates that this sighting was possibly caused by a helicopter.
The brief description of the sighting from ATIC Form is as follows:
Object travelled from NE to NW at a moderate speed. Object hovered in one spot for approximately 30 minutes. Object disappeared by its light gradually going out. No sound was heard.
In light of above considerations and the wind direction, evaluation of this sighting is possibly aircraft (helicopter).
