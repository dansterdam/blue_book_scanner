The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing instructions and diagrams related to observations and sightings. There is no photograph present on this particular page. I will now proceed to extract and output all the textual content found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object would appear above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with handwritten text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Month Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent to a narrative explanation of the specific points of the questionnaire: I took the children out looking for the object when it was first sighted - it seemed to be a solid object and was sitting still in the sky, not moving, and had a glowing light on the top of it. When we first saw it, it was up high in the sky, then it came down closer and we could see it better. It seemed to be round in shape and was a bright light, not like a star or planet. It stayed in the same general area for awhile then just seemed to disappear. The children were quite excited about seeing it and were scared at first, but then got used to it and wanted to watch it. I have no idea what it was, but it didn't seem to be anything we are familiar with.
