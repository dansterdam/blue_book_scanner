Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am enclosing an article which appeared in the Groveton, Missouri newspaper on January 30, 1968. This article describes an incident involving a UFO sighting on the evening of January 28, 1968.

The article states that two observers, Mr. and Mrs. Donald L. White, saw a bright light in the sky at approximately 7:30 p.m. on January 28. According to the article, the object remained stationary for several minutes before moving rapidly across the sky and disappearing from view.

The article mentions that the White family has reported several similar sightings in recent years, and that local authorities have been unable to explain the phenomena. It also notes that Air Force investigators from Project Blue Book have been informed of the incident.

I was wondering if your office could provide any additional information or analysis regarding this case. Please let me know if you require any further details.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

"Dear Sir, the time has come when I cannot longer withhold this report on the facts as I know them regarding a close encounter - (We mentioned this to some friends who said, perhaps the wise course would be to submit this confidentially, anonymously, as all kinds of unpleasant consequences can follow its public disclosure, and the possibility of harm to one's self or family should be considered.) 

I was motioned by a being, who looked me in the eye, and the light was so bright it literally paralyzed me. It was a most unusual experience, and the being seemed to communicate with me, though no words were spoken. I felt a degree of what I can only describe as awe and humility - nothing like the usual stage-managed, Hollywood type. The being then gave me a single pointed gesture which seemed to mean, "Go on about your business, this encounter is over." I have struggled with this experience ever since, not knowing whether to tell anyone or keep it to myself. But in our conversation with our friends, they convinced us that perhaps we should record it confidentially, for what it may be worth in advancing our knowledge of these strange phenomena.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]"

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Groveton, Missouri, of a sighting on 9 February 1968.

2. The observer sighted an extremely bright light and also heard a loud noise like a jet aircraft. The object was observed for several minutes at a high speed above a person's head, and had a pulsating rhythm.

3. The noise started with two or three louder and higher pitched pulsations, which were two or three times louder than the noise it made afterwards as it moved away.

4. Airport Radar has suggested that this was possibly the sighting of a satellite. However, the observer did not indicate any vertical motion characteristic of a satellite, and the pulsating rhythm and sound characteristics are not typical of a satellite.

In the event that you have any helicopters from your field or have operated in that area in recent days, we would be interested in determining if you have any data which could substantiate this sighting or offer other clues. If so, was there any activity in the area at that time? If so, was there any activity in the area at the time?

4. To obtain this data, we realize that you must do quite a bit of coordination and research. However, we would appreciate your answering the following:

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Your memorandum of April 17, 1968, in reference to a reported UFO observation on February 9, 1968, was received.

Except for unusual incidents, we have disposed of our aircraft movement records for the concerned date. No investigation similar to the UFO observation was recorded at the control tower.

Instances of aircraft operating in the area do not normally do not operate in the area at the time involved.

The observations related in paragraph 2 of your memorandum gave indication of low altitude operation of a turbine-powered jet aircraft. I would suggest contacting Wichita, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, FAA Regional Offices for possible information. Those facilities are such headquarters of the location reported and conduct extensive helicopter operations.

Sincerely,

James E. Kennedy

FOR MORE ON UFO

The Air Force is investigating a reported unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) which was observed in Groveton, Missouri, on February 9, 1968. 

The object was first sighted at approximately 9:20 p.m. and was observed for approximately 30 minutes. It was described as appearing to be circular in shape, with bright lights on its circumference, and it moved slowly across the sky. 

According to the Air Force Aerial Phenomena Section at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, the object was apparently tracked on radar by the FAA. The Air Force has requested additional information from the witnesses and is investigating the sighting.

GROVETOR, MO., 6 FEBRUARY 1968

1. In accordance with your letter of 25 March 1968 requesting that I contact Mr. and Mrs.  (redacted) from Grovetor, Missouri with reference to (redacted) UFO report. 

2. I visited in the location with a lengthy telephone conversation with (redacted) who stated so I first asked with XXXXX (redacted)  investigation into the 6 February 1968 incident reported on that date at about xxxx hrs near Grovetor, Missouri. The essential facts as I understand them from (redacted) statements are as follows:

3. (redacted) was in his pickup truck on the country road at about xxxx hrs on the evening of 6 February 1968 when he noticed an unusual light in the sky which he first thought was an aircraft but soon realized was a hovering object. This object slowly descended until it was at an altitude of about 100 feet or less above the ground. (redacted) stopped his truck and observed the object for some time, estimating that he watched it for about 10 minutes. 

4. The object was described by (redacted) as being approximately 30 feet in diameter and having a domed top. It appeared to be metallic in color, possibly aluminum, and had a series of multicolored lights around its circumference. These lights blinked on and off in a definite sequence. (redacted) stated that the object made no sound whatsoever and there was no exhaust or other indication of propulsion. 

5. After the 10-minute observation period, the object suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared into the distance. (redacted) was convinced that what he saw was not a conventional aircraft or any other known object. He was somewhat shaken by the experience but otherwise unharmed.

6. I have tried to obtain from (redacted) as much detailed information as possible regarding this incident. He appears to be a credible witness, and his description of the object and its behavior is generally consistent with other similar reports. I would be pleased to discuss this case further with you or to provide any other information that may be of assistance.

He is, however, hypnotized and although he tells me he can drive without glasses, his memory does not see to run as well as it did. He had his glasses on when we discussed this case more closely than he did.

This case was considered as unidentified. Since it is a one-witness case (as we exclude the cows as witnesses) we are left with the reality that this man has been subjected to some traumatic experience by way of a vivid dream or an outright hallucination. We do not understand under what conditions such hallucinations may occur or what their psychological meaning is for the individual in question.

One out of 20 people are capable of deep trance hypnosis. In some cases in which he has hypnotized people, the people who have had encounters (with phenomena) have shown a deeper trance capability than otherwise expected, according to the hypnotist. The question remains whether they are also hallucinating or whether they are also remembering correctly while in the trance state what they believe they have perceived.

An examination of Mr. [redacted] as to whether he had ever been hypnotized and he said that he never had, and that "none of stuff" was out of his field."

So we do not assume hypnosis in this case as a factor, and there seems to be no period of missing time to account for a possible encounter, and there is no evidence of any physiological phenomena that could be associated with the alleged encounter. We are faced with the parapsychological conclusion that Mr. [redacted] did see something for which there is no ready explanation.

Re: U. F. O.

Dear Sir:

I reside on a farm approximately 30 miles north of Kansas City, Missouri. The residence is approximately 1/2 mile back from the highway with a pasture in front of the dwelling. I an employed in the office of a large utility company and returned to my cabin, I noticed my cattle looking up in the air and low to the ground as would a mother to her crying child.

Last night I looked around several times but saw nothing frightened or scared. I immediately jumped from my bed and ran to the picture window in my living room. It was a dark night but there was a distinct glow - giving off considerable light. It seemed to be hovering and turning slightly. It made sufficient light for me to maneuver around a card table less in the middle of the room and to see certain objects in the pasture in a rough outline. 

As my vision adjusted from darkness to this moderate light, I was able to see that it was a tremendous circular object, reproduced as best as can on the attached sketch.

I could not determine from the convex sides of the craft whether it came from some classified sources under government or whether it was reflected light from some foreign source of manufacture and then brought to this ground. In any event, there was sufficient light to see the major limbs on some small cedar trees, a stump, the cows fence in the foreground and other detail.

The object appeared to be at least 100 feet in diameter, and to be hovering 50 to 75 feet above the ground, although I could not say that it was not on the ground. I could feel the warmth from it at the distance involved.

Page 2
February 9, 1968

On the ground, or possibly higher in the air, There were definitely seven open-shaped craft, or possible three times as many, Their spacing would indicate that, if the craft were in fact round, there were probably 15 or 18 of these equally spaced around the craft, I could not judge their exact size but it was definitely of a size which was difficult to give perspective to, I would "guess" they were from 20 to 50 feet in diameter, They did not make any noise that I could detect, The craft hovered motionless for a minute or five minutes, I was so entixed by the sight,

I have been looking for, or two, not stolen, and think undoubtedly stolen, without a trace.
My first reaction, on hearing the cows, was that someone was among them, On see-ing the craft, I remember thinking, "this is very definitely not an airplane or anything I have ever seen before in my life," They are at a possible U.F.O., but rather some monstrous helicopter or other craft,
Some of the cows were milling about that object, and from perhaps 100 to 200 feet away, Cows with younger calves were belling, and some of the calves were sucking, A small stream of water or liquid stream, came from the object about 2 feet of the ground, The object appeared to be hovering, motionless, about 2 or 3 feet over the ground. It remained some little time after the cows departed, but I have no idea whether this constituted the entire observation, It was during this time that I concentrated my attention on the object in question,

All during this time there had been a distinct noise that I have a difficulty in describing, It might whirl around above his head at high speed and yet it had a pulsating rhythm of some kind, When the craft departed, this noise was for or three times louder and more rapid, The craft moved away rapidly, in absolutely straight line, reaching a speed I would say was several thousand miles per hour, leaving a trail behind it,

This experience was over, I had the flashes and felt chilled at the same time, and was perspiring all over, I went back to the bedroom and was surprised that wife had not awakened, The light on the alarm clock that I had not noticed before, indicated it had been gone only about 2 or 3 minutes, apparently no disturbance.

I am 57 years of age, employed as an advertising manager for Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company in Kansas City, Missouri, and in 1965 became a member of the County Planning and Zoning Commission, 2 of which I am chairman and of which I have never related this experience, In the time from the encounter to the County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, there must have been a time lapse of about 2 or 3 hours, and during that time I had attended that meeting without awakening me, When I returned to the bedroom, after the experience related in the above paragraphs, it must have been past 9:15, I must have been awakened.

More I cannot tell you, I have made no announcement to anyone in the local area, It certainly seems to mysteries or publicity of any kind, It I can be of any assistance to you, please let me know.
