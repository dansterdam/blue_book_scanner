RADAR OBSERVATIONS
INDIAN OCEAN
Second Officer P. Friburg of the Danish MV Jane Maersk, Capt. N. E. Pedersen, Master, reports the following radar observations obtained on the morning of 3 August 1953 between 10-11 A.M. ST, in approximate position lat. 19°35' N., long. 68°48' E., the coastline of Barr Al Hikman, bearing 338°, only 18 miles distant, showed a well defined outline on the radar screen. This line receded as the ship's course was altered on a southerly course toward Masirah Island near Ras Abu Rasas, bearing 340°, only 18 miles distant gave very poor return.
On the return voyage, it was noted that the hills on northern Masirah gave very weak returns while land gave a good return up to 30 miles.
