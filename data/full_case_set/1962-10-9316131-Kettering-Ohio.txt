Dear Sirs:

In your letter of October 15, you will tell you our beliefs about the unidentified flying objects. We tell you that these objects are not space ships from another planet, but are:

On a flying object of unknown nature landed in Angeles National Forest on August 3, 1962. Reliable witnesses saw three occupant beings.

We say that this object contained a high beings from another planet outside of our solar system or outside our universe. We can give you more information about our planet to the world, where these beings come from, but the first step is that you must request information to your government on the matter of this incident.

Witness: examples of the United Air Lines viscount over St. Louis. We theorize that this UFO which had a supper power,appeared at the head of our time, and still has a mystery power. These beings made this UFO carry a huge power on a house in Angeles National Forest, a week prior to this report . It would be most appreciated if you would send us all the material known, such as photographs, measurements and charts concerning this case, and any other information to continue studies concerning things extraterrestrial.

Sincerely Yours,

Stephen M. Halbert

24 OCT 62

Maneuvering Star in Calif.
AT 10 P.M. and thereafter on the eve of 24 October 1962, Mrs. Bernice Mclaughlin and her daughter Theresa, of El Cajon, Calif., and her daughter Mona observed a bright star-like object in the northeast sky about 10 degrees above the horizon. At first the object appeared star-like but after approximately 5 minutes it appeared as several dots of light arranged in a horizontal row, each of which appeared to give off light. The observers noticed that the object seemed to move from side to side and then would seem to stop suddenly, then resume its movements. It was evident on the unknown object.
The object made several changes of location, each time traveling at a speed greater than that of military aircraft known to the observers. At one point the object hovered motionless for some time before resuming its movements again. According to W.E. Downs, APRO member who interviewed the observers, there did not seem to be any sound to be observed in relation to the object's maneuvers. The intensity of the object's light varied somewhat during the maneuvers. This but did not appear to be correlated with its motions. Observations were terminated by the observers' need to attend to other matters, and the object did not appear to leave or disappear.

While KSU was driving a car at Beal & St. Route 43, when Mr. X's object blinked on the horizon, it went out. He pulled off the road & it was seen again. They were 3 miles N of Streetsboro. They were less than 60-seconds the first time. The object was out in the distance & made no noise. It appeared as one red light revolving. The object looked to be about 2000 feet up. It started to go out - first one side would go out, then the other side would go out. It pulled off the road 3/4 mile N of Kent. The object left the scene without a sound. There was no sound that could be heard from the object. He could now see 5 red lights, separated by about 1/2 mile. The lights were about the size of a dime at arm's length. He watched it for 5 minutes until it finally disappeared in the distance. There were no other observers with him, but he felt the craft might be a balloon or some type of experimental craft. He had no information on what the object was, but it could have been two separate craft, but he felt the craft might be a balloon or some type of experimental craft.

Variety Of Objects
In Colorado

(continued from page 1)
Mrs. Shoap stated that she and her husband observed some unidentified flying objects moving quite close together and slowly over their home near Kettering, Ohio, in the San Luis Valley in Colorado. Mrs. Shoap called in several of her neighbors who also observed the objects.

On the same morning at 7:30 a.m., Mrs. Elinne Shoap gave further details. She said that she and her husband were outside their home, saw the objects weaving back and forth over the mountains and disappearing and reappearing. She said there were about 10 objects and they appeared to be reflecting sunlight. The objects at times would disappear entirely for 10 minutes, reappear, and then disappear again.

Late on the nights of the 26th and 27th, radar operators at Pueblo, Colorado State Patrol headquarters reported picking up small targets, but no visual confirmation was made.

Following are some of the sightings which have been reported in Colorado:

An aircraft sighting was reported at 8:20 p.m. over Ellicott. The witnesses saw a bright light descending on the northeastern side of Pikes Peak. It descended to about 5,000 feet and then leveled off, appearing to hover over the area. The witness reported hearing a faint humming noise. The object finally disappeared.

On the 26th, Mrs. Vera Rogers spotted two unidentified objects coming down over the mountains southwest of Sedalia. She watched them for nearly an hour. They appeared to be very bright, like-like appendages. They disappeared from view at about 7:20 p.m. 

Three hours later, at 10:30, an object was seen descending in the area of the Eckert, Colorado home of Mr. and Mrs. Cib Williams. The object appeared over the trees and seemed to hover briefly before going out of sight. Mr. and Mrs. Williams were the witnesses.

VICE CHIEF OF STAFF 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON, D.C.

DEAR SIR:

RECENTLY, WHILE READING THE ENCLOSED NEWSPAPER ITEM, I WAS ONCE AGAIN IMPRESSED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SUBJECT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO'S) IS BEING MADE A LAUGHING MATTER BY THE PRESS. AT THE TIME I WAS IN RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA, WORKING AS A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TIME OF GOING TO WORK THE DAY I SAW WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE A GENUINE UFO. HOWEVER, IN AN EFFORT TO FORGET THE EXPERIENCE, I HAVE NEVER REPORTED IT OFFICIALLY.

IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 5:30 A.M. I WAS WALKING FROM MY QUARTERS TO THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING WHEN I NOTICED AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT HOVERING SILENTLY IN THE SKY APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING. IT WAS ROUND IN SHAPE AND HOVERED MOTIONLESS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. SUDDENLY, AT AN UNBELIEVABLE RATE OF SPEED, IT SHOT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. WHILE I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE SIGHT, I SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO ANYONE AND HAVE REMAINED SILENT SINCE THAT TIME. 

I AM ENCLOSING THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING WHICH INDICATES THAT DESPITE THE SEEMING SERIOUSNESS OF THE MATTER, IT IS STILL BEING RIDICULED AND MADE A LAUGHING STOCK. I AM WONDERING IF THERE IS ANY WAY THIS MATTER CAN BE MADE TO RECEIVE THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IT DESERVES.

VERY TRULY YOURS,

Dear Mr. -,

The Office of the Chief of Staff has asked this office to reply to your letter concerning flying objects over South Dakota.

Since no case is considered verified, the sightings are being filed for information purposes only. However, the information is deemed necessary.

Regarding the Columbine sightings, our files do not have any cases concerning the "arm of a figure" that was reportedly seen. Unless additional information is available, we have no data to substantiate this claim.

I trust the inclosures will give you a better understanding.

'Strange' Flying Objects
Seen Over W. Colorado

GUNNISON, Colo. - F or the third night in a row, mysterious bright objects have been seen in the sky over West Colorado by scores of reliable persons. Their strange behavior has renewed interest in reports of "flying saucers" in this area.

The objects are first sighted about 8 p.m. and remain visible for more than an hour, according to observers. They appear to be circular, glowing reddish-orange objects, moving at high speeds and making sharp turns. Sometimes they stop momentarily, then dart away at tremendous speed.

The objects are not believed to be aircraft, astronomers say, as their actions are quite unlike anything known to aerial vehicles. Witnesses have included business and professional men, farmers and ranchers, policemen and other trained observers.

In another Colorado town this week, two Larimer County residents reported sighting a luminous, egg-shaped object that hovered for a time and then took off at a high rate of speed. It was 50 to 60 feet in diameter and weighed an estimated 200 to 300 pounds, they said.
