The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and illustration. The sketch shows a diagram with a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above it at various angles. There is also a compass illustration showing the cardinal directions.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curves to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" on the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

24. Date you completed this questionnaire:

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire. Please add any additional explanation of your sighting.

I had just come home and was getting ready for work at 5:00 A.M. I looked out the window and saw an extremely bright light over the northeast part of the town. It was hovering and moving slowly. It had no sound that I could hear. It was about 300 feet away and 1,000 feet high. The object was round and had four flashing lights on the outside. Very bright. The sighting lasted about 3-4 minutes. The bright lights dimmed after a while and then the object just gradually increased in speed and disappeared into the northeast. I did not see the object actually leave, it disappeared from view. 

On this particular night the weather was as dark as a dark night, stars were visible but the moon was not out. The visibility was very good. The object was so bright it illuminated the darkness. I have never seen anything like this before and it wasn't like any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. I hope this will keep you informed.

Its flight was East to West, she was looking South. She called WCTN radio and TV. The speed was about ECHO'S. She has also observed meteorites. Her mother's address is Mrs Floyd C Perk, 416 Locust St, Janesville, Wisconsin.

Transcribing the text:

Janesville, Wisconsin
Feb. 7, 1965

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you to inform you of an incident that happened in our town on the 24th of January, 1965. But first, I would like to state that I could not make up my mind just what to explain in detail, because of the fact that I did not see the object myself, but rather how to explain it. I send herewith a sketch of how it appeared to a neighbor, and I hope this will help to explain what is the story. 

This neighbor of mine was doing some work in his yard when he noticed an object up in the sky. The tail of the object, which seemed to him to be somewhat triangular in shape, was a flashing blue light. The tail was about twice as long as the width of the object itself.

Incidentally, this neighbor of mine was lying down (somewhat like a plane or flying saucer pilot, rather) when he noticed the object. He states that it moved from the southeast to the northwest and then back again, and that it emitted a high-pitched whine that he could hear. The game was going towards the horizon.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
