                               Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Re radars now operating on ground

   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
      of target:

   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (130°), etc.,
      and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable,
      how long did the target stay in the turn and what was
      its speed?

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into
      several targets upon approach:

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent
      with size of object; faint; fading, pulsating at regular rate:

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted

   a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits:

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.:

3. Local flight schedules of commercial, private and military air-
craft flying in vicinity at the time:
   (Check Canadian activity if close to border)

4. Possible releases of testing devices in vicinity sent aloft by
Ordnance, Navy, Air Force, Army, Weather Units, Research Organizations
or any other; obtain computed or observed trajectory of device (theo-
dolite, radar readings, etc.)

5. If object contacted earth, obtain soil samples within and without
depression or spot where object landed for purposes of making com-
parison of soils.

6. Obtain photographs (or original negatives) where available; if
not, secure sketches of:

   a. Object
   b. Surrounding terrain where object was observed
   c. Place where object contacted earth (if this happened)
   d. Maneuvers
   e. Formation (if more than two)

7. Secure signed statements.
