The photograph at the bottom of the document is very grainy and unclear with high contrast; it appears to be an image of a night sky with some irregular light patterns, possibly clouds or lights, but no distinct objects or details can be identified with certainty.

Name and address of observer: W. E. Patterson
                              AESS, Los Alamos, New Mexico.
Occupation and hobbies: Inspector Atomic Energy Security Service.

Comments of interrogator relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s):
              Complete investigation relative to intelligence and suitability
              made as a requisite for employment.

TRANSMITTAL SLIP AFSN:
 
This inspector was extremely startled by this object as the first impression
was that it was a plane on fire and about to crash nearby. As the eyes became
adjusted to the distance this Inspector had the distinct impression of seeing
a silver or aluminum covered body inside the flame or glow that resembled
that part of a fuselage of a war-time German type plane from behind the wing
to just in front of the tail assembly. This inspector further had the im-
pression that the object was actually flaming and that the flames were quite
visible. The overall shape of the object including the flame or light was much
like the accompanying sketch. The object appeared less than 1/mile from the
observer and the outlines were very distinct.

NOTE: Sketch referenced above not received.

TIME: 1836

DATE: March 8, 1949

DIRECTION: South to North (F 275° True - L 289° True)

SPEED: 300 Miles per hour

COLOR: Bright White with a slight greenish tint

ALTITUDE: 12000 to 15000 ft.

POINT OF OBSERVATION: Station 106 (106° 16' 16° W - 35° 52' 33" N)

OBSERVER: Inspector Leonard Lang

DURATION OF OBSERVATION:1 to 2 seconds

STATEMENT OF OBSERVER: I was sitting in the tower at my station, and glanced
out the northwest window just as a bright white object
went by on the western horizon. I jumped up and ran
outside just in time to see the object either go out
or disappear into the cloud cover. I checked the time
which was 1836 hrs. The object was traveling from
south to north, roughly parallel to the range of
mountains and at approximately the same height as the
top of the peaks.

UNCLASSIFIED

TO:
Lt. S. D. Hightower, Protective Force Headquarters

FROM:
Inspector, W. E. Patterson, Section III

TIME:
1335

DATE:
8 March 1949

DIRECTIONS:
Appeared to be over installation traveling North and approaching the earth at about a 45 degree angle.

SPEED:
Seemed to be drifting toward the earth at less than flying speed of a modern twin engine plane.

COLOR:
Intense white light.

ALTITUDE:
Lower than the clouds obscuring the peaks to the West of the installation.

POINT OF OBSERVATION:
From Station 103 in Bryce Canyon
(106⁰ 14' 54" W - 35⁰ 53' 09" N)

SOUND:
None heard.

OBSERVER:
W. E. Patterson

STATEMENT BY OBSERVER:
This Inspector was extremely startled by this object as the first impression was that it was a plane on fire and about to crash nearby. As the eye became adjusted to the distance this Inspector had the distinct impression of seeing a silver or aluminum colored body inside the flame or glow that resembled that part of the fuselage of a two-wing German type plane from just behind the wing to a foot in front of the tail assembly. This Inspector further had the impression that the object was actually flaming and that the flames were quite visible. The overall shape of the object including the flame or light was much like the ace of spades from the observer. The object appeared less than 1 mile from the observer and the outlines were very distinct.

The image provided shows a scanned page that appears to be blank except for horizontal lines typical of lined notebook paper. There are no photographs or any discernible text on the page. Therefore, there is no text to output as would be expected from an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system.

- page 14 -

The image displays a hand-drawn sketch on a sheet of paper with several annotations. The sketch appears to depict a UFO sighting from the perspective of an observer looking through a window. It is not a photograph but an illustrative representation of an event.

The annotations on the sketch are as follows:

- At the top left, there is a letter "(A)" with cardinal directions marked around the edges of the page ("S" at the bottom for south, "E" at the bottom-right for east, "W" at the top for west).
- Along the west edge, the text says "TREES AND CANYON WALL".
- On the right side in the northern direction, it states "OPENING IN CLOUD OVERCAST" indicating a break in clouds.
- There is an arrow in the middle labeled "LINE OF FLIGHT" which points towards a saucer-shaped object that is the focus of this sketch.
- The saucer-shaped object has an arrow pointing at it with the label "OBJECT".
- Below the object, near the eastern direction, it states "TREES AND CANYON WALL".
- Just below that, it reads "OUTLINE OF WINDOW IN THE SHACK".
- At the bottom of the image, the text reads "SKETCH - by Inspector Patterson."

Please note that the text is handwritten and might not all be transcribed perfectly due to the handwriting style and the quality of the scan.
