G.S.C. Comm[ent] form Evanston 4/13
My name is ------------
This is an eye witness report of an unusual sighting near my home at ------------, Maywood, Illinois on September 14, 1962.
At about 7:30 p.m. this evening I was looking out the kitchen window facing west and noticed an unusual light in the sky. It seemed to be a bright round light or object hovering in the sky. I watched it for several minutes as it seemed to change in shape and brightness. At first it appeared quite round and bright, then seemed to elongate and become dimmer, only to regain its round bright appearance. It was not blinking or moving rapidly, but hovering or remaining stationary. After watching it for several minutes, it suddenly extinguished and disappeared from sight. There was a clear sky at the time with a few scattered clouds.
I am a former radio operator (amateur) and have had some experience in observing the night sky and heavenly bodies. This object was unlike anything I have seen before and I am at a loss to explain what it could have been. I felt it was unusual enough to report to your office as an eye witness account.
I would be glad to discuss this further with you or provide any additional details if required.
Sincerely,
--------

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
[Text begins]
Aware of this, a mute shone in our sky a moment ago. Though no larger than a
star, it showed up plainly enough. It was an elliptical shape, moving at a steady
pace across the heavens in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be at a high
altitude and was plainly visible for several minutes before it disappeared from
view. I watched it closely, it was not a satellite, meteor, or any known object.
It was clearly an unidentified flying object. I cannot offer any explanation for
what I saw. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before in the sky. I hope
this information may be of some use to your study of the phenomenon of unidenti-
fied aerial objects. Please let me know if you have any other questions. I would
be happy to discuss this further.
Sincerely,

The report refers to a "sFheric:1 object" observed at iZaywood, Illinois on August 8, 19c2. The object was observed for about 10 minutes by tro reliable witnesses. The description of the object is very cimilar to that of an unidentified flying object reported in other cases in the bluct book files.

Please advise me as to any ection I can take to obtain clarificat:on from the Air Force regarding this particular case. I am quite concerned about the implications of what appear to be reliable reports of unconventional acriel phenomena that remain unexplained after investigation by the Air Force. If you can suggest any appropriate government agency or private organization that I night contact for assistance, I would greatly appreciate your advice.

Thank you very much for your consideration of this matter. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely yours,

Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object became about 3 to 4 times larger when directly overhead. It seemed to be revolving or spinning, with a smooth surface or top section and appeared to have a lower section which lighted up intermittently. It moved in a slowing down, speeding up pattern. The object was brighter than the daylight sky and could be seen clearly against the sky. It seemed transparent or translucent at times. The object was observed for a period of 5 to 10 minutes. It disappeared rather suddenly, going straight up out of sight.

I planted my car and went on to a near-by field where I could get a better view. As I watched, the object was hovering, motionless, about a mile away. There were no lights visible on it. I observed the object for about 5 minutes before it suddenly shot straight up at a very high speed and disappeared. I called the local police station to report what I had seen, but they told me there was nothing they could do about it. I am convinced I saw a flying saucer. The object was disc-shaped and seemed larger than a car. It made no sound that I could hear from the distance I was viewing it. I called the Air Force base near here, but they said they had no record of the incident and were not interested in investigating it further.

THE "ORVILLE" PHOTOS
In the Spring of 1962, the Project Blue Book investigation of a reported UFO sighting in the village of Maywood, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), was made. The community was aroused by a series of UFO sightings over the village.
Maywood UFO Roundtable featured Mr. Earl Neff, of the Cleveland Air Force Base, and was M.C.ed by Reverend James H. Ryburn of KWSO Radio.
It showed a UFO over a cornfield. The stereotyped "flying saucer" has a dome, flat base, and has a metallic shine.
The date of this occurrence was July or August of 1962. The group claimed (1952 Advisory Board) they had found evidence that two were seen in July.
The boys were taking pictures of a new kitten in their backyard, when they noticed something in the sky. A saucer-shaped object hovered over their backyard for about five minutes. The boys estimated the saucer to be about forty feet in diameter (roughly 240 MPII). The object seemed to be of dull metallic color, with no visible signs of propulsion. Attempts to photograph the "flying saucer" were made, but the resulting photos were not very clear or distinct.

200 ft. per second and they passed them about 3-4 times a night, sometimes remaining in the air for as long as 15 minutes.

The bottom of the object was dark or lead-colored. One boy observed it had a portholelike device which emitted a bright light, which formed a beam of light directed toward the ground.

When Mr Herman, an officer at Quality Controls of Orville, Ohio, contacted the Dayton Controla Agency to report the same sighting, he was told his report had previously been picked up when he saw the picture of the UFO in the Orville (crviGle) newspaper. This was done at the request of Commander POIC, who had been notified.

We accepted his offer to show us the photograph which he had taken some days later at which time he had tracked down the negatives and produced the photograph showing the object. (Since ground by POIC is not further identified, assume it refers to the Air Force Project Blue Book unit.)

When he later tried to show us the photograph, he stated that it had been stolen from him and that he had no other copies. He then related the circumstances under which the photograph had been taken.

The information contained in this text indicates that there was a Project Blue Book UFO report filed regarding a sighting in Maywood, Illinois in 1962. The document describes the sighting details, including the appearance and motion of the UFO object, as well as the attempt by the witness to provide a photograph of the object. However, the photograph was ultimately not available for review.

The text in the document reads:
"A person named Talmero A. Tencel, 40, who worked in Veracruz, Argentina, gave the following information: 
According to him, the following incident occurred: One night, at about 22.45 hrs, Tencel along with his brother-in-law and sister-in-law, were driving on a country road near Maywood, Argentina when they saw an object surrounded by a classic luminous halo which they estimated to be about 25 meters in diameter. This object paced their car for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared. Tencel said he is certain that this was not a normal aircraft as they were accustomed to seeing, and he believes it was some sort of unidentified flying object. He said the object made no noise and its light was an intense white. He also said he felt nervous as a result of the incident, and had not intended to make it known."

Light Over Baltimore
On the first of August, 1962, Mr. and Mrs. P---- of North Point Road, Dundalk, witnessed a meeting of Millwright County near the entrance of Dundalk Avenue, a portion of Baltimore County near the intersection of North Point Road, and went to the top of a hill near the North Point Road. When they looked up and saw a light, larger than the glow of the moon, hanging above the entrance to Dundalk Avenue. The light remained stationery for periods of two to three minutes, and then moved quickly back and forth along the entrance of Dundalk Avenue, and to a point some two hundred yards to the north. This movement was repeated at irregular intervals of every two to three minutes, lasting for a few seconds, and proceeded to a point, extinguishing around 9:15 p.m. until about 9:25 p.m. when it disappeared. A bit earlier, a couple who were also driving in the vicinity, reported that a large, bright object was seen to move from the north and seemed to land or touch down in the vicinity, where the stationary light was observed, and then receded in the same direction toward the north, and was not visible but for a brief sight.

The object was in sight for 3-4 minutes and was described as round, metallic in appearance, and emitting no sound. The family also sighted the object with a telescope and it appeared to be similar in shape to a dirigible but was circular rather than elongated. The witness observed the object through 7 x 50 binoculars at first with the naked eye. No landing or other maneuvers were observed and the object merely disappeared from sight, traveling in a straight path and at a uniform speed. The witness estimate the size of the object to be approximately 100 ft. in diameter and the distance from the observer to be approximately 2-3 miles."

UFO Over Milwaukee, Wis.
At 11:30 a.m., CST on August 3, 1962.
Mr. and Mrs. Mark Spruna of Milwaukee, Wis. were driving near the intersection of a busy highway when they saw a bright, round object in the sky. According to their report, the object appeared to be hovering, then suddenly accelerated and moved away from them at a high rate of speed, going higher than any known type of aircraft. They say the object had a "sunflower-shaped light" blinking in an uneven pattern as if it were a series of flashing lights. It then disappeared from sight, taking the same course it had taken.
The distance and altitude of the object was estimated by the witnesses to be about 3 miles and 4,000 feet, and it remained in sight for over a minute before suddenly accelerating and disappearing. The area was clear-shaped, and it had a color similar to bright copper or bronze. They also reported it had "lighted a trail as it went." No sound was heard.
According to their description, the object "was clearly unusual or strange" and they compared its appearance to that of a mushroom, with a dome-shaped top and a lower portion that seemed cylindrical or somewhat more elongated.

On August 6th, a resident "phish" of Pasco, Washington, reported
that at about 11:00 p.m. on the night of August 4th, he and a
neighbor observed what appeared to be a dark, cigar-shaped object
in the sky over Pasco. The object was approximately 100 feet long
and was moving in a northwesterly direction at a moderate rate of
speed. The resident stated that the object had no visible markings
or lights, and made no sound. After observing the object for
approximately 45 seconds, it disappeared from view. The resident
stated that the weather was clear at the time of the observation.

NO CASO (INFORMATION ONLY)
6 AUGUST 1962
BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA

At 1:45 a.m. on the morning of August 6th, a truck driver named [REDACTED] was driving on a highway in the vicinity of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Suddenly his motor died and the headlights went out. As the truck slowed to a stop, the driver noticed a luminous object in the sky about 150 yards away. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was accompanied by another smaller luminous object. The larger object was estimated to be about 30 to 40 yards in diameter and was emitting an intense white light. 
The driver watched the objects silently for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before his motor and lights were restored. He then proceeded on his way, but the truck seemed to be under some influence as it did not respond normally to the controls for several minutes. The driver claims there was no sound from the objects and that they departed at a very high speed.
