Estimado Ser:
Observo en usted grande sensatez y cordura que me informa de un fenomeno que es posible compruebe con rigor cientifico. La importancia de ese acontecimiento y su significacion son problemas que es justificado juzgar con profunda cautela y sin tuna precipita(?) energia de espiritus alborotados. La primira y principal cualidad del hombre culto es la de conservar siempre imparcial equilibrio de razon y la de saber esperar con calma la documentacion explicativa de los hechos. Muchas veces lo que parece sobrenatural o extraordinario suele tener despues una sencilla explicacion cientifica que lo reduce a proporciones naturales. Esta facultad de prudente espera y de desapasionada investigacion es por lo tanto nuestro deber, si queremos obtener de la ciencia el maximo de rendimiento. Tratandose de fenomenos de este linaje, que a veces afectan interesantemente nuestra curiosidad, hemos de poner en claro su autentica naturaleza, sin dejarnos llevar por ilaciones anticipadas y apresuradas. De la misma suerte que el arbol caudaloso broto de la pequena semilla, es posible que de ese hecho que avisa de su presencia, pueda brotar fruto valioso de nuestras investigaciones, si las practicamos con sensatez, metodo y constancia. En espera de nuevas y mas detalladas informaciones, aprovecho esta oportunidad para saludarle atentamente.

Department of Defense
Washington
Sir:
I take pleasure in sending you some information I believe will be of great help to you, as well as a suggestion.
Approximately six months ago I was lying down, resting - and a very clear and sunny day had a beautiful cloud in the sky which was a very strange and unusual shape. It had the shape of a very large star. From it came brilliant rays of light and a red ticket which could be noted as a great distance on the ground. Several livid lights were observed in my eye vision accompanied by no clouds. The sky was clear and brilliant. I am sending you this information.
The suggestion I want to make pertains to how your government can have conclusions or dollars which could be used to notify and prepare your bases and territories. It could suspend the allowance plan to the relatives in time of peace. I am doing this because I love your great country deeply and I would like to say that my husband is military with thirty-three years service.
Respectfully yours,
[Signature]
