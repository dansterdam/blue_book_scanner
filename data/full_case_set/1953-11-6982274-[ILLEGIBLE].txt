The report describes the sighting of a bright light in the evening which made a sudden stop and then took off again at a high rate of speed. The witness stated that it might have been an aircraft, but that they were unable to identify it conclusively. The report mentions that the object made no sound and was observed for several minutes before disappearing.

There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a handwritten report or account describing a series of observations of unknown bright lights or objects in the sky.

OCR text output:

At eight-forty-seven on the evening of the 6th of November I saw the bright lights again in the northwest sky. The lights were very bright, and maneuvered in a curious pattern for some twenty-five or thirty seconds. The lights were definitely not an aircraft, for they seemed to be stationary at times and then would move rapidly to another position. This time the flight pattern was somewhat different from the other night, the lights seemed to be moving up and down, as well as from side to side, in a very erratic manner. I watched the lights for some time, until about nine o'clock, when they seemed to disappear. 

About fifteen minutes later, at about nine-fifteen, I saw the lights again in the same general location in the northwest sky. The lights appeared to be extremely bright, much brighter than any other stars or planets in the sky at that time. The lights seemed to be pulsating, and would appear to surge in brightness and then diminish again. They also maneuvered in a very peculiar and erratic fashion, moving up, down, and from side to side, and seeming to vanish and reappear. I watched the lights until about nine-thirty, when they slowly seemed to fade from view. I have no explanation for what these lights might have been, they definitely did not appear to be any conventional aircraft. I am quite familiar with all types of aircraft, both military and civilian, and these lights bore no resemblance to any known type of aircraft. Nor did they appear to be reflections or mirages, as the lights were seen by several other witnesses in the area, and their observations tallied with mine. I can only conclude that I witnessed something quite extraordinary, which I am unable to identify or explain.

NO CASE (INVESTIGATION ONLY)
3 NOV 1953 (ENGLAND)

THREE MESSAGES RECEIVED 19 NOVEMBER 1953 REGARDING SIGHTING IN ENGLAND:

1. A British sergeant and four assistants were testing a radar set in a London suburb. They observed on their screens something which seemed larger than ordinary planes. The signal came from an object which seemed circular or spherical in color.
The five radar men knew they were dealing with a mysterious metallic object about 60,000 feet in altitude. It appeared and disappeared intermittently, the strange signal persisted.
The object was seen by the civilians to be about the size of a silver pound coin at 60,000 feet. It disappeared behind cloud at this altitude.

2. The British War Office and the Royal Air Force Fighter Command are said to have been investigating this phenomenon. They said the huge spheroid was giving off or reflecting a fierce light and "had paralyzed their plans as it manoeuvred".

3. The British War Office and Air Ministry confirmed this morning that a "strange object" had been tracked on November 3rd by RAmy radar. The object - a metallic phenomenon - was also seen by two Royal Air Force men who watched it through 6x30 binoculars the same day and again the following day and night for over an hour.

- page 5 -

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a scanned document page. The text on the page describes a "flying saucer" controversy in England, where the meteorological office in London reported a "white disc" sighting by two fliers and registered observers. The text mentions that this sighting is being investigated as a possible new aircraft.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

The people in England are up in the air over a new "flying saucer" controversy. The Meteorological Office in London says a "white disc" reported by two fliers and registered observers "is nothing but a weather balloon." Another official claims the alleged "flying saucer" fits the description of a new aircraft being developed for the power.

The text in the document is as follows:

VIRGINIA FIREBALL OF 1953 NOVEMBER 3
RADAR NO. 2252

As per RAGLAND and C. S. CARVIN

This date, November 3, 1953 (FST), a report on visual observations of a brilliantly luminous object was made by several persons in or near Richmond, Va. It appeared suddenly at an estimated altitude of about 30,000 feet and was observed for about 6 to 7 seconds. It was seen from several different locations by observers in different general directions, and one witness from another location (D. F. Wood at Arlington) also reported observing it. Owing to the violent and rapid motion, and the brief duration, range of the object, the observations could not be correlated to determine very accurate data.
Some of the more definite data gathered is as follows:

Time of observation			--	6:12 1/2 p.m. EST
Distance 				--	113*
Bearing 				--	A = 278° 45', e = 36° 35' at 110 km
Projected length of path		--	1-2 km
Altitude of first sighting		--	ca 30,000 ft
Zenith angle (elevation)		--	54°, h = 9°
Radiant correction parabolic		--	d=156°, h=6°

On this same date at 6:18 p.m. EST, a visual observation from a slightly different direction was made at Arlington, Va. by D. F. Wood. This observation could not be coincident with the previous observation from Richmond, and may be added as a separate incident in our records.

12. Identification of the fighting formations: This sighting was reported to us by Lt Col 8. I. Hatch from the 1st Fighter Group, USAF; Borie AFDB, Texas. According to his report, on 13 August 1952, he and two other pilots were flying in formation near Crete when they observed an object maneuvering in the sky.  The object was silver in color and appeared to be a disc about 30 feet in diameter. The object was seen to make a rapid climbing turn and then level off at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 3 minutes.
The reporting officer finds no explanation for the sighting. He states that it was very difficult to determine the nature of the object. The pilots estimate the size of the object as 30 feet in diameter. The pilots stated that the object maneuvered and climbed in a very rapid manner. They could not indicate the objects speed, but did state that it was far in excess of the speed of their jets (which they estimated to be 600 mph). The pilots stated that the object appeared to be metallic and disc-shaped.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to imagine that you are at the point shown and place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. It also instructs to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person standing in the foreground. The instructions indicate that this sketch shows the position of the object when you first saw it and when you last saw it. There is also a smaller inset sketch showing a similar landscape view, with the text "Object did not move" written below it.
