Dear Col Friend:

Dear Mr. President,
These words for me to write a great many of them have come, yet I still want to be getting on to my text to tell you about an object that is landing in my backyard, and is going to try to communicate with me.
I have made a few efforts to photograph or study object, but failed. The object is now standing still, and I did not know what to do, for I was not expecting a visit from outer space. My nerves are pretty much upset over this. Can you send me some advice on the procedure? Also, can you arrange for someone competent in such matters to come out and make an investigation? I would be eternally grateful.
I remain as ever,
Steelville, Missouri

There is one large object standing on the ground and was located in between some woods. It was very close to the witness - only about 20 yards away. The object was a dome-shaped craft, about 40 feet in diameter, with portholes around the middle. It seemed to be resting on a landing gear of some kind. The witness was able to observe the object for about 2 to 3 minutes before it suddenly took off at a high rate of speed, disappearing over the trees. No sound was heard during the sighting.

And don't want me
to try and explain it. I was
curious to know if the object destroyed
itself as I have read it does sometimes.
What it looked like and how would it
look was cloudy the night it was
seen.
