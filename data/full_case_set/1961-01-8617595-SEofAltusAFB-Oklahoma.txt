Text extracted from the document:

Atch #6). Mr. ______ judgement and reliability were high. There were no other reported sightings of this object. The distance from the observors to the object, which was reported to be at about 6000 feet, made it unable to estimate the size or identity of this object. 

On 15 January 1961 and other employees of KXXX-TV, Altus, Oklahoma, sighted an object approximately 1/2 mile SE of Altus AFB. Mr. _____, on the south edge of the Altus AFB, is a newsman and controls the TV cameras and other equipment of KXXX-TV. He and several others sighted the object on 14 January (see Atch #2), except that it is difficult to determine the size and altitude of this object.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather hand-drawn sketches and diagrams. The sketches appear to show illustrations related to the sighting of a UFO or aerial phenomenon.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position it was when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this larger sketch.
