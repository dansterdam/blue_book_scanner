The image appears to contain two elongated dark objects against a lighter background in the upper section. The object on the left is horizontal and the object on the right is set at a diagonal angle. Below the object on the right, the word "WHITE" is visible. These objects resemble the typical "UFO" representations but their true nature cannot be determined from this image alone. Given the context of a UFO report document, these could potentially be illustrations or representations of witnessed unidentified flying objects.

The text below the objects is not very clear due to the quality of the image. However, I'll transcribe what is discernible:

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report; Give significant, factual, and descriptive paragraph. Link reports—same subject. Identify source later in report and in Form 112—Part III)

On 31 May 1949 at 1130 hours the pilot of an F-80 aircraft, while on a training
mission, at an altitude of 20,000 feet over Misawa Air Force Base (40°43'11"/141°22'12"),
reported that he observed what appeared to him to have been from the reflection of sunlight 
off an aircraft in flight. The amount of light reflected appeared to him to be that
equal to a B-29. The object appeared to the pilot to have been 20 to 30 miles distant,
above 30,000 feet, moving at a high rate of speed in a northerly direction for a dis-
tance of from 7 to 10 miles and then disappear into the overcast.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER: Operational units have been consulted and it has been
determined that neither weather, tactical, civil nor special classified aircraft were
in the area at the time of the sighting. In addition the observer stated that he had
the other F-80 Aircraft in sight at the time of seeing the object and that it could
not have been the shadow of other aircraft.

It is believed that this object may have been the planet Venus or a foreign air-
craft on reconnaissance.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Certificate

    I, 1st Lt. James J. Giles, AO-752222, certify that the following is true and
correct to the best of my knowledge;

    On 31 May 1949 at around 1110 hours I was flying an F-80 on a check ride with
Lt. Nelson. Lt. Nelson had taken off a few minutes with instructions to meet me
over the field at 20,000 ft. When I got to 20,000 feet I started a slow orbit arou-
nd the field trying to spot the other F-80. My attention was caught by a reflecion
out to sea at an altitude higher than mine. I continued to turn while watching the
object, It was twenty to thirty (20-30) miles from shore, above 30,000 feet and
moving at a high rate of speed at the base of a cirrus overcast. The object moved
in a Northerly heading for seven to ten (7-10) miles and then disappeared into the
overcast.

    I continued on the mission and reported the incident to my operations officer
after the office opened in the afternoon.

                                       /s/ James J. Giles
