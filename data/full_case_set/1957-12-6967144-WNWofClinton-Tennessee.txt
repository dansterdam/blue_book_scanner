AFCIN-7F-1 Comments/Conclusions:

1. Inclosure #6: The evidence presented in this report indicates the possibility that under certain conditions, blips may appear on radar screens which cannot be explained. Equipment, which on occasion, acts in an unusual manner are more susceptible to weather conditions. The equipment in this case did not pick up the reported blips was operating in the L-band.

1. At first glance this report resembled what might be expected of the sighting of a weather balloon slowly descending to earth. However, the size of the return (big as a quarter) is more indicative of the return from a storm center. Since the weather was rainy, it is probable that what was seen was weather return.
