6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS

7. COURSE
Irregular and circular
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Objects described by 26 people. Each story different but all indicate objects shaped like saucers with a light in the center and a smaller light on the top. Objects flew in a circular pattern, hovering at times and then accelerating rapidly at a high rate of speed. The indicated object was spinning and as such was compared to the rotation of a radio dial face.
9. COMMENTS
The descriptions of the objects which have been gathered from numerous witnesses give evidence of a phenomenon which seems to coincide with instances of similar Sightings made elsewhere. These sightings may be caused by atmospheric refraction, but the unusual and complex nature of the gyration of the objects tends to discredit this explanation since common astronomical refractions do not usually produce effects of this magnitude or complexity.

On August 21st, several people in David City, Nebraska reported to the State Police about a circular object in the sky. The object appeared to be large and bright. The witnesses observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared. No other details about the sighting were provided.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a text document with the title "Ballute Test Successful". The text describes a successful test of a "Ballute" (balloon-supported parachute) on a space capsule, indicating that it was tested by the Avco Corporation and could withstand altitudes of up to 225,000 feet.

"Ballute" Test Successful

Balloon To Be Used On Space Capsules

A balloon-supported fabric device, called a "Ballute", recently developed by the Avco Corporation, has successfully passed tests at the Avco Research and Advanced Development Division (ARDD) for Space capsules.

The Ballute is designed to retard the descent of a space capsule after it re-enters the earth's atmosphere. It works on the principle of a parachute, but is capable of withstanding pressures and temperatures far in excess of those which can be withstood by conventional parachutes.

In recent tests, the Ballute functioned satisfactorily at altitudes of over 225,000 feet - its zenith--and at a speed in excess of 14,000 feet per second, or over Mach 4. The successful test occurred at the Avco facilities in Wilmington, Mass.

The Ballute, which is packed within the space capsule, is deployed after the capsule has re-entered the earth's atmosphere. At that point, it rapidly inflates and establishes a stable subsonic descent.

Dear Mr. ****,

Your letter of April 27 addressed to a Lt Colonel coming under this office has been referred to this office for action.

Almost eight letters you direct our attention to a sighting of an unknown object in your community on the night of April 25. This flight is of extreme interest to the Armed Services. The incident was reported to the Air Force by you, and an investigation was made by an Air Force representative. This report has been received, and we are greatly interested in the details and data you have provided. A preliminary analysis indicates that the object was of an atmospheric or terrestrial nature.

In the vicinity of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, on April 27, there were several reports of unidentified flying objects. The Air Force immediately dispatched aircraft to investigate. The pilots observed flashing lights in the sky which appeared to be aircraft. However, upon closer examination, the objects proved to be an illusion or atmospheric phenomenon. The pilots were unable to identify or intercept the objects.

Will also record to an apparent unexplained sighting in your locality. This office greatly appreciates your interest and cooperation in reporting such occurrences. We will continue our analysis and evaluation of the data and information you have provided.

Sincerely yours,
Frederick C. Durant III
Secretary
Project Blue Book

A check with the Director of the Alder Planetarium in Chicago relative to the sighting of an unidentified flying object at David City, Nebraska on August 8, 1960 reveals the following:

A letter was sent to you on August 11, 1960 relative to this sighting. The Planetarium records indicate they knew of this sighting and had assisted in checking on it. It appears the observatory personnel were cooperative in supplying data on this sighting as this is their standard procedure with such cases.

We hope this information provides the details you requested. Do let us know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN

Dear Lt. Col. Erickson:

I would like to advise you of an investigation involving the subject report of an Unidentified Flying Object in David City, Nebraska, reported under date of 3 April 1960.

This page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document does not contain any photographs. The text on the page appears to be a handwritten report describing a sighting of an unidentified object that was observed with a scientific satellite and detected by a tracking station. The report mentions details about the object's appearance, trajectory, and observed characteristics.

Transcribed text from the document:

"...had a Brilliant lighting sighting that lasted about 15 minutes, and stated that the object was then about 3 feet in diameter and had a fiery appearance. He said the object diminished in size until it was only about a foot in diameter and then suddenly went out of sight.

This object was also detected by a tracking station, and apparently was viewed visually by a Clayton Stinson, who reported it to the Air Force.

This incident occurred the evening of Oct 8, 1960, near David City, Nebraska, and the CDE number is 60-8226949."

"Very interesting.
As these have a clippoing of the story (may it ever be told?):

Recently it have been learned, somewhat confidential, details surrounding governfient neet [sic] about the subject concerning the UFO reports. An official in Washington constantly are going about making some vague statements, that state citizen's and military people obtain a copy of the well known "so-called" report of the. The information getter know has a clipping of the statement which will to given more publicity.

Would appreciate any comments or reactions you may have to this whole matter. Thankygeu."
