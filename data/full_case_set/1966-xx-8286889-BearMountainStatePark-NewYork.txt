The image contains two photographs that are described as physical evidence, including materials and negatives. However, the image does not show any visible photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting.

I. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might account for the sighting:
Called in too late to check with FAA/First Air Force.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
1st Lt Thomas A. Emerson, UFO Officer
4713th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron
Stewart AFB, New York

The initial interview was by telephone. The pictures were received 1 1/2 weeks after the call. A second interview (personal) was conducted after receipt of the pictures. The observer requested that the negative and photographs be returned to Mr. , upon completion of necessary studies, analysis and duplication by the Air Force. Mr. is married and employed by his father. He is quite interested in the object and his picture which is enclosed. The only thing that can be added is that Mr. and his brother developed the photographs.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as material and photographs: Two photographs and one negative. (Both attached)

MEMO for the Record: 20 Jan 67

Contact was made with one of the witnesses. The brother of the witness who took the picture revealed the following:

The camera was a 35mm Revere and the film was Kodachrome Pan 127 film. There was no flash used. There is no focusing of the lens. There was no more than a second from the time the picture was taken until the object disappeared from sight.

There is no exposure data since all you have to do is set in the film and take a picture. There is no focusing of the lens. There was no more than a second from the time the picture was taken until the object disappeared from sight.

The image appears to be a letter on Northwestern University letterhead from the Department of Astronomy. The letter discusses the evaluation of UFO sightings and mentions that no photograph is included. As an OCR system, I will output the full text of the letter as follows:

NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201
DEPARTMENT OF ASTRONOMY
LINDHEIMER ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH CENTER

17 November 1967

Major Robert H. Quintanilla, Jr.
USAF (Retired)
Research & Analysis Division
Directorate of Information Air Force Base
Ohio 45433

Dear Major Quintanilla: 

On personnel only: I find no substantiation for the evaluation of BCAK, particularly in view of the photo-analysis report, No. 67-16, dated 20 September 1967, which indicates that the UFO photographs do not show the object. The motion is regarded as double exposure and/or retouching. The photographs appear to show indirect lighting, not a primary source, which does not constitute sufficient reason to believe that a hover duration of the unidentified object does not constitute sufficient reason to believe that a hover duration of the unidentified object of the magnitude considered has occurred.

After examination of the print by myself and by Mr. George C. Valley, we feel that the negative should be requested for further examination. Mr. Valley is a qualified photo-analyst, disagrees with the photo analysis presented in the report. It will be noted, from the print, that the focus is soft in the central portion of the picture, an indication that the distance only cannot be reliably estimated. Consequently no judgment can be made as to the real size of the object, if this judgment is based solely on this quality of focus.

My recommendation is, therefore, that the evaluation by changed from "not substantiated" to "inconclusive".

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek

The image contains a photograph analysis report from Project Blue Book regarding an unidentified flying object sighting at Lake Tiorati, Bear Mountain State Park, New York on December 18, 1966. The report states that the photographic analysis has negated double exposure and/or re-touching, but no satisfactory explanation could be made of the unidentified object. The object appears to be circular in form, with a defined "superstructure." The analysis indicates the object to be substantially nearer than the background trees, and no attempt at "painting" was evidenced by the sharpness of the general scene. The report is signed by Douglas H. Rogers, Intelligence Research Specialist, and approved by William L. Turner, Chief, Photo Analysis Branch and Walter Price Jr., Chief, Photo Exploitation Division.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
MR 67-10
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: Lake Tiorati, Bear Mountain State Park, New York
DATE: 18 December 1966
AF: 1 negative, 2 prints (35MM)
QUALITY: Poor to Fair
1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to a request submitted by Major Quintanilla (TDDET) to determine the identity of the subject photographed.
2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the negative has negated double exposure and/or re-touching. The photographic appears genuine; however, no satisfactory explanation could be made of the unidentified object. The object appears to be circular in form, with a defined "superstructure". The object appears and the relative clarity indicates it to be substantially nearer than the background trees. No attempt at "painting" was indicated as is evidenced by the sharpness of the general scene. The object exhibits some small degree of blurring indicating motion, the direction of which could not be ascertained.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text extracted from the document:

APR 2 1 1967

Dear Mr. _______,

Reference your recent observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Your photographs were forwarded to experts for a comprehensive evaluation. They found that the object appears to be circular, indicating a substantially larger size than background stars. This suggests the object was extremely close to the photographer, the relative size of which could not be ascertained.

No other UFO reports were received from the northeastern part of the United States on December 15, 1966.

Thank you for submitting your observation to the Air Force for evaluation.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
