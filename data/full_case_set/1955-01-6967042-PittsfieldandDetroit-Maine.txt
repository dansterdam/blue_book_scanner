TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Dear Major Foster:

This is in reply to your letter of 25 Dec 1954 concerning your intention to write a magazine article on an unidentified flying object sighting in Alaska during the winter of either 1954 or 1955.

In your letter you state that the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has a record of this sighting, therefore, the evaluation or solution must have been made locally as this office has no objection to your writing on this particular sighting for publication provided the manuscript is submitted to this office for security, accuracy and policy clearance in accordance with AFM 190-4.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER

NAME OR TITLE: Major L. J. Tucker
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: SAFOI-34
REMARKS: Regarding Case in the Files Here,. Alligator, your info only, as I am enclosing under separate cover for Foster in Alaska during the time mentioned, and he claims not know of the case. A Maj. Cooper here, who was also there at the time, knows nothing of it. How in the hell can he write objective about something he knows nothing of is beyond me.

With reference to paragraph of his letter, I think I should be told that the Air Force, and particularly ATIC has the responsibility for investigating this. Investigation of UFO and we have no desire to make a latent investigation. Especially since a solution have been arrived at locally in the Alaskan Command, and ATIC was not even advised.

Looks to me like he is trying to get into something he knows little about.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"SUBJECT: Release of Information of Belieu UFO Investigation

TO: Headquarters, 20th Air Division 
    ADC 
    Eglin Air Force Base, Florida

FROM: Director of Intelligence, Hq USAF
    Washington 25, D.C.

1. For the benefit of the Air Force space research program I would like to make the following comments on the investigation of the UFO incident concerning Mr. Belieu which occurred on 28 December 1954 near Pittsfield and Detroit, Maine. Although the investigation led to a "solved" case, a very little known information was obtained on certain details. 

2. As a member of the ground air intelligence I have set up a group to make a systematic study of the characteristics and performances of air objects which may be reported as unknown flying objects. A more detailed study reveals that many of the reported incidents can be explained as natural phenomena, misidentified familiar objects, or possibly even conventional aircraft under unusual conditions of visibility. This investigation, since the collection was assembled in a hurried fashion, is still somewhat incomplete. However, the collected material appears to be of value as a starting point for more detailed study by the Air Force or other agencies of the investigation.

3. The object that passed so brilliantly that it was seen from a deep and wide-spread blizzard that covered the whole of western Alaska. It was a brilliant blue-green color and traveled at an estimated speed of over several thousand miles per hour. (For 15 minutes after disappearance, sub-sequential bright flashes, which were apparently a hydrogen bomb explosion, occurred in the distance.) Immediately after the object passed, this particular area was observed to have a high rate of radioactivity which lasted only for a few minutes.

4. It appears that the Air Force is not greatly interested in this type of information from a defense point of view. However, I believe that the scientific value of the accumulated material could contribute substantially to our knowledge of the upper atmosphere and the nature of phenomena occurring therein."

- page 16 -

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, discussing a UFO sighting.

Text found in the document:

They had seen a brilliant light thru the blizzard and overcast, to the west of them around 7:30 PM., the night of January 6th. The object must have been a long distance from them, a little later it disappeared to the northeast. Also, the light had been seen in a southwesterly direction. Later in the investigation, it was found that there had been a military jet in the area, but there was no connection established between the light and the jet.

Early in the investigation it was learned that some civilians and military aircraft had been reported as unidentified. Evidently, it was learned later, that a civilian aircraft was flying in the area. The crew members were questioned, but they could not recall having seen anything in the area. Up to this time there was no knowledge of a meteorite.

Both men insisted they had seen a large red light that looked as large as an orange held at arm's length and it had appeared to be moving erratic for the aircraft, then it suddenly disappeared. The path of the object was downward and to the right of the aircraft which was heading north. This appeared to resemble a controlled descent rather than a simple visual illusion. No persons had seen reported the phenomena.

8. If no objection is forthcoming -- an incidentally if Air Force is uninvested in further action or examination -- I request permission to write an article examining related possibilities, including contributions of the civilian and military observers, a brief overall summary, and of course, on the national interest, but I would appreciate a response to this inquiry.

January 1955
Wilmington, California

Source: UFO Investigator July-August 1950

A witness in Wilmington, Cal- ifornia who did not wish to have his name revealed, reported that at about 11:00 PM, August 1950, he saw an object in the sky that appeared to be maneuvering as if it were searching. He said that the object moved very slowly and silently at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. He stated that it was shaped like a disc and emitted a yellowish-white light. The object remained in sight for about five minutes before it slowly climbed straight up and out of sight. He reported this sighting to the Air Force and was interviewed by an official of that organization.

Oregonians Sight
Eerie Blue Light

LA GRANDE, Ore., Jan. 28 -
(AP)- A glowing blue light is the
latest thing being spotted in the
sky over the Blue Mountains
along the Washington-Oregon
border.

Two state police troopers,
Erikon and Barnes, and farmer
Thompson reported that they saw
a blue light over the highway near
Meacham, Ore., last week.

"It dimmed his lights," Thompson said. "There was no sound. It seemed to be coming
toward him on the highway. It
flicked a beam of blue light that
passed over his car and when it
moved upward the beam also raised
with a humming sound.

A week later, Robert Hackus, 
another state policeman, reported
he had encountered the same phenomenon. He looked up and saw overhead what appeared to be a blue
light from which a humming sound
seemed to come.

SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
   REPORTS INDICATE THAT TWO SEPARATE SIGHTINGS OCCURRED ON 3 JANUARY 1955 IN THE PITTSFIELD AND DETROIT, MAINE AREA. THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS AT ABOUT 2015 EST IN PITTSFIELD, MAINE. THE OBSERVER REPORTED SEEING FIVE ROUND, ORANGE COLORED OBJECTS APPROXIMATELY 25-30 FEET IN DIAMETER TRAVELING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 500-600 FEET AND AT A SPEED OF 100-150 KNOTS. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE.
THE SECOND SIGHTING WAS AT ABOUT 2020 EST IN DETROIT, MAINE, APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES FROM PITTSFIELD. THE OBSERVER REPORTED SEEING FIVE ROUND, ORANGE COLORED OBJECTS APPROXIMATELY 25-30 FEET IN DIAMETER TRAVELING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 500-600 FEET AND AT A SPEED OF 100-150 KNOTS. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE.
INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS
   THE OBJECTS REPORTED WERE DESCRIBED AS ROUND, ORANGE COLORED AND APPROXIMATELY 25-30 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TWO SEPARATE SIGHTINGS WERE VERY SIMILAR, INDICATING THAT THE OBSERVERS MAY HAVE SEEN THE SAME OBJECTS. 
THE OBJECTS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE TRAVELING AT 100-150 KNOTS AT AN ALTITUDE OF 500-600 FEET. THIS TYPE OF PERFORMANCE IS BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.

LOCATION: PITTSFIEDL AND DETROIT, MAINE

DESCRIPTION: AT APPROXIMATELY 1805 EST ON 6 JANUARY 1955, TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED NEAR DETROIT, MAINE, BY SEVERAL WITNESSES. THE LIGHTS WERE REPORTED AS MOVING RAPIDLY AND ERRATICALLY AT AN UNDETERMINED ALTITUDE. THE LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES. SHORTLY AFTER THE INITIAL SIGHTING, ANOTHER BRIGHTLY LIT OBJECT WAS OBSERVED NEAR PITTSFIEDL, MAINE, ABOUT 20 MILES FROM THE DETROIT SIGHTING. THIS OBJECT WAS ALSO REPORTED AS MOVING RAPIDLY AND ERRATICALLY AT AN UNDETERMINED ALTITUDE. NUMEROUS WITNESSES REPORTED THESE SIGHTINGS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND SEVERAL OF THEM WERE SUBSEQUENTLY INTERVIEWED BY AIR FORCE PERSONNEL.

CONCLUSION: THE SIGHTINGS REPORTED HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA (UAP). THE SIGHTINGS EXHIBITED CHARACTERISTICS NOT CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES, OR OTHER IDENTIFIABLE OBJECTS. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS PLANNED TO ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE UAP.
