PAPER (THE RECORD EAGLE) OF TRAVERSE CITY, MICH RAN FOLLOWING ART-
ICLE: QUOTE: PUBLIC AGENCIES TODAY WERE CHECKING REPORTS BY SCORES
OF GRAND TRAVERSE AND LEELANAU COUNTY RESIDENTS THAT A CIGAR SHAPED
PLANE COLORED OBJECT FLEW ACROSS THE WESTERN SKY IN A GENERAL NORTH
SOUTH DIRECTION SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET MONDAY. OFFICIALS WOULD NOT
SPECULATE ON IDENTITY OF THE OBJECT WHICH SEVERAL WITNESSES SAID MOVED
AT GREAT SPEED ACROSS SKY AFTER AT FIRST APPEARING TO BE MOTIONLESS.
THE ONLY EXPLANATION FORTHCOMING TODAY, AN UNSPECIFICAL ONE, WAS THAT
AIR DEFENSE COMMAND PLANES WERE CONDUCTING ROUTINE EXERCISES IN THE
LEELANAU COUNTY AREA AT THAT TIME ON MONDAY AND THE OBJECT MIGHT HAVE
SEEN SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM A SILVER COLORED PLANE FUSILAGE.
THE OBJECT SIGHTINGS WERE REPORTED AS OCCURING ABOUT 5:45 P. M.
UNQUOTE. END OF REPORT.
