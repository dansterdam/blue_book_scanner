There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

The text, as interpreted by an OCR system, is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Jul 11 1964 Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

During the month of June or July, the 26 to 30 years old couple reported a sighting of an unidentified object which they observed for some 10 to 15 minutes - hovering at a considerable altitude. They became greatly frightened and terminated the observations - leaving the scene hurriedly. Both were highly impressed with the performance of the object and its movements. It appeared to be very rapid in pace and made some quick maneuvers. It was most unusual and spectacular. They could not account for it. They were baffled and greatly upset by the experience. I may have additional details in my records which I will check and report later if pertinent.

Here is the text contained in the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

Once again the witness contact the reporting authorities at the time same. More or less reluctantly related the following: 

Shortly after the sighting the following day, Mr. witness decided to look around the area where the object was first observed. This area was approximately 1 mile south of Sarasota, Florida, and close to the main highway. He went there out of curiosity to see if he could find any evidence that might indicate what the object was. To his surprise he found the remains of what appeared to be a small metallic object, approximately 30 inches in diameter. It was badly damaged and distorted, but he was able to discern that it was a thin shell, perhaps 1/16 inch thick, of a highly polished aluminum-like metal. The material was extremely light in weight and the edges were jagged, as if the object had been ripped or torn apart. There were no identification marks of any kind visible.

Transcription of the text:

Meet that came glancing off the morning sky rapidly. The object was about 30 feet in diameter and an intense white light. As it passed over, it made a sound, like steam escaping, and then it was gone. This object was apparently traveling at a very high rate of speed. The morning was clear and bright at the time of sighting. The object was viewed for a matter of seconds only as it passed quickly across the sky from south to north.
