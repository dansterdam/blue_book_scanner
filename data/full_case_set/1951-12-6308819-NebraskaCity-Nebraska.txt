UNCLASSIFIED
29 May 1952

A. Mr. [REDACTED] reported that at approximately 8:15 p.m. on 29 May 1952 he observed a strange object in the sky near Nebraska City, Nebraska. He stated that the object appeared to be travelling at a high rate of speed and left a trail of light behind it. He said that the object was in sight for approximately 30 to 45 seconds and then disappeared. He further stated that there were no other cars in sight on the highway at the time and he was the only observer.

Analysts (G-2) who have studied this case do not believe that Mr. [REDACTED]'s observation constitutes a valid sighting. They state that the object he described is probably a common meteorological phenomenon and that there is no evidence to indicate that he observed an unconventional aircraft. 

There is no record indicating that this sighting was previously reported to higher authority. Prior relative to the above information is being forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. VIEWS OF THIS INCIDENT:
a) OFFICIAL: In the absence of a positive report, no action is taken by higher authority. An active investigation of this incident is presumed to be unnecessary since the evidence supporting a valid sighting is lacking.
