An unidentifed brilliant white object was sighted off the coast of New Jersey at approximately 2045 Eastern Standard Time on 12 October 1952. The sighting aircraft was approximately 25 miles North of Atlantic City on a northerly heading and the object position was out over the water at approximately 2 O'clock. The GCI station was contacted and the controller vectorred the aircraft toward the unidentified object. The aircraft flew on a heading of 030 degrees toward the object for approximately 10 minutes apparently without getting any closer to the object. The image picked up by the GCI station faded and the aircraft was directed to return to its home station.

In accordance with AFI 200-5, 29 April 1952, the following report is sub
mitted.

While on combat air patrol an unidentified brilliant white light was
sighted off the coast of New Jersey at approximately 2045 Eastern Standard Time on
12 October 1952. Aircraft was approximately twenty-five (25) miles North of Atlantic
City at the time and the light was sighted at approximately 2 o'clock high. Object
was at first believed to be a star but this was discounted as the object appeared
to gradually lose altitude, and in comparison with the stars in the area the object was
far more brilliant. At this point the GCI station was called and asked if they had
a contact and anything in that area. The controller reported that he had a faint
contact and vectored the aircraft on a heading of 090 degrees which is toward the 2 or
3 degrees. The course which would have taken the aircraft straight for the unknown
object. The aircraft was at an indicated altitude of 20,000 feet and the object
was located approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the aircraft at a reported distance
of several miles. While flying toward the light at an indicated air speed of 250
knots, the bright object appeared to move gradually to the right and also gain in
altitude to a position of approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the observers. Both
observers at this time thought that the object could possibly have been an aircraft
in's great distance with its landing lights on. However, after flying toward the
object for about 10 minutes, both observers agree that the object appeared as do-
cular to egg shaped with what appeared to be a mid-wing with approximately 30 to 120
degrees dihedral. Directly below and as a part of the circular section there appear-
ed a tail or cone shape section of the same brilliant white light, ''huh comes on or
call station seemed to vary in size, sometimes appearing short and then longer.
Sketches by the two observers are shown below.

The object when described was likened to an F-86 aircraft standing on its nose except
that while the fuselage of an F-86 is long and slim the object was oblong or egg
shaped. The complete object as pictured above glowed with the same bright white
light. The object appeared to remain in the same general area and there was no
indication of contrails, sound or maneuvers with the exception of a gradual change
in position in both elevation and azimuth, as described above. Observers could
note no exhaust or propulsion methods as the entire object glowed with a brilliant
white light, Observers suggested that the tail of white light which projected
below the cylindrical portion, which varied in size, could have been an exhaust
since it was of the same color as the rest of the object, indicating its toothless
flame the color would have differed. The GCI station finally lost contact with

The image contains two sketches depicting parts of an unidentified flying object (UFO) as described in the document. The first sketch shows a side view of what is labeled "Tail Cone" and resembles the tail part of an aircraft. The second sketch is below the first one and also illustrates the "Tail Cone" of the object, appearing to have a more detailed shape.

1. In accordance with AFI 200-5, 29 April 1952, the following report is submitted.

a. While on combat air patrol an unidentified brilliant white light was sighted off the coast of New Jersey at approximately 2045 Eastern Standard Time on 12 October 1952. Aircraft was approximately twenty-five (25) miles North of Atlantic City at the time and the light was sighted at approximately 2 o'clock high. Object was at first believed to be a star but this was discounted as the object appeared too readily brilliant at times, and the observation was soon made that the object was far more brilliant. At this point, the CC station was queried and asked if they had contact or anything in that area. The controller reported that he had a faint contact and vectored the aircraft on a heading of 080 degrees which was within 2 or 3 degrees of a course which would have taken the aircraft straight for the unknown object. The aircraft was at an indicated altitude of 20,000 feet and the object was located approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the aircraft at a reported distance of several miles. While flying toward the light at an indicated air speed of 250 knots, the bright object appeared to move gradually to the right and also gain in altitude to a position of approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the observers. Both observers at this time thought that the object could possibly have been an aircraft's navigation distance with its landing lights on. However, after flying toward the object for about 10 minutes, both observers agree that the object appeared as circular to egg shaped with what appeared to be a mid-wing with approximately 30 to 40 degrees dihedral. Directly below and as a part of the white light section there appeared a tail or cone shaped section of the same brilliant circular light which was longer or bell shaped, sometimes appearing short and then longer. Sketches by the two observers are shown below.

Had it been an exhaust flame the color would have differed. The CC station finally lost contact with the object.

Whatever object it had on its scope and also the aircraft did not appear to be getting any closer to the brilliant object, the controller directed the observing aircraft to return to home base.

b. Object was first sighted at 2045 Eastern Standard Time 12 October 1952 and was under observation for approximately 20 minutes.

c. Observation was by visual means from an F-94B type aircraft at 20,000 feet indicated altitude with an indicated air speed of 250 knots. The object could not be picked up by aircraft radar.

d. When object was first sighted, the observing aircraft was approximately 25 miles North of Atlantic City at 20,000 feet indicated. The sighted object was out over the water at approximately 2 O'clock and roughly 20 to 30 degrees above the observing aircraft. Observers estimated the object to be at 50,000 feet and several miles away.

e. Flying experience of observers is as follows:
(1) Robert Sonnett, Pilot, 2nd Lt, AO-2222869, total flying time 500 hours with 1 year 9 months experience.
(2) James W. Wallace, Radar Observer, 2nd Lt, AO-2222028, observer time 150 hours with one year experience plus 11 months naval aviation cadet pilot training and 150 hours student pilot time.

f. Weather at time of sighting, ceiling and visibility unlimited with slight ground haze. Temperature at 20,000 feet indicated was minus 15 degrees centigrade.

g. It is believed no meteorological activity or condition can account for the sighting.

h. No photographs were taken.

i. Interception action taken was as follows: Shortly after sighting the bright object, the 646th AC&W Squadron was contacted and asked if they had picked up anything in the area of the sighted object. The controller reported he was faintly painting an object and then vectored the aircraft on a heading that was within 2 or 3 degrees of the unidentified object visually sighted. The aircraft flew toward the unidentified bright object for approximately 10 minutes. The object on the ground station's scope finally faded and the F-94 aircraft was directed to return to its home station.

j. There were no other aircraft observed in the general area of the sighting.
