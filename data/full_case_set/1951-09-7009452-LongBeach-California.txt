APPENDIX IV
MARCH AIR F.G. BASE - 22 SEPTEMBER 1952

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT
The first report of this incident, which appeared in the Project Blue Book file, indicates that the discrepancies and the following account of the incident is considered to be:
At approximately 0700 PST, two F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George Air Force Base, Victorville, California, to investigate an unidentified object that had been reported overheading in the vicinity of March Air Force Base, Riverside, California. The flight reported to GCI that they observed an unidentified object which was at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet and appeared to be in a left orbit at about 4,000 ft. The object continued to maneuver, made a left orbit and passed over the two aircraft. At one point the object appeared to be in a left orbit at about 4,000 ft. The object continued to maneuver, made a left orbit and passed over the two aircraft. At one point the object appeared to be in a left orbit at about 4,000 ft. and at another point it was observed to be at approximately 55,000 ft. The pilots stated that the object appeared to be a fuel shortage. At approximately 0820 PST, four additional F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George Air Force Base to relieve the two above-mentioned F-86's. The four aircraft were vectored to the vicinity of the object, however, the object was not observed again. It had apparently departed the area, going in a direction, according to the pilots, which appeared to be a swept-wing aircraft.
The second element of the group, which had maintained visual contact with the object throughout, reported that on the overlay, observed in flight, the object apparently increased speed, leveled off at approximately 55,000 ft. and then proceeded to dive. The F-86's, however, were unable to close the gap. It was reported that the object appeared to be round and silver.
No more intercepts were attempted. At no time was the object observed on the radar scopes nor was it reported to be definitely tracked by radar.
The F-86's, however, were definitely tracked by radar.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
At 0700 PST a radiosonde balloon was released from the Long Beach Municipal Airport. The balloon which was lost at 0721 PST, sighted from the airport, bearing of 95° true, due to a malfunction and tracking equipment. The point on ground was approximately 40,000 ft. The winds above 10,000 ft. are unknown but it is logical to assume that a constant direction of 270° and an average velocity of 20 knots above 15,000 ft. and 30 knots above 20,000 ft. The balloon was tracked up to 50,000 ft. at which point it disappeared. According to a telemetering constant direction of 270° and an average velocity of 20 knots above 15,000 ft. and 30 knots above 20,000 ft. The balloon was tracked up to 50,000 ft. at which point it disappeared.

Referring to the ground track of Flight 2-A, if a 30 knot wind at 270° is assumed, at 0910, the approximate time the F-86's sighted the object, the balloon would be at an altitude of 46,700 ft. and nearly directly over the aircraft. The altitude of the aircraft at this point was approximately 42,500 ft. It would seem that the balloon could have been mistaken for a strange object. Once again the orbiting of the object cannot be explained.

The attempted intercept by Flight 2-B cannot be explained. If the ground track of the balloon is plotted as indicated, it is correct to assume that the flight was observing a balloon. The time at which they sighted the object is not known. It is highly possible that a wind shift or nearly 360° could occur between the time of the original sighting and the attempt to intercept it, due to the high altitude of the object.

The possibility of this object being an experimental aircraft from overseas appears extremely remote. The case was checked with negative results. No other balloons were observed in the vicinity.

III. CONCLUSION
With the information available, it cannot be concluded that the object was definitely the radiosonde balloon launched at 0700. However, since the balloon was near the flight path of the two aircraft, it can be concluded that the unidentified object observed was possibly the balloon.

23 September 1951 - 0230 PST, an unidentified object was sighted over Long Beach, California. Four US aircraft were scrambled and the object was described as being similar to a balloon with four lights. The object was at an altitude of 23,000 feet and moved in a straight line for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing. Weather conditions at the time were such that the object's movement could be easily observed.

Balloons were released from San Diego, Long Beach and Santa Maria, California at approximately 2220 PST. All of these stations reported that their balloons were released and weather station personnel stated that it would be very doubtful if their balloons could have been mistaken for the object observed.

All of the major aircraft factories and installations containing experiments on flights of experimental aircraft stated that no experimental aircraft were in the air at the time of the incident.

Additional information has been requested as to additional details of the incident, such as times and locations during the attempted interception by the F-86A and other possible balloon launchings.

REFERENCE: Memo to Has Lost - dated 26 October 1951

The Commanding General, 27th Air Division, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, California, requested an investigation concerning the sighting of an unidentified object observed from Norton AFB on the evening of 25 October 1951 between 1930 and 2030 hours at 50,000 feet. Four P-51s were dispatched to investigate and establish contact with the object. During the climb to the altitude of 43,000 feet, the object disappeared. Visual contact was maintained only for a very short period of time and the object was described to be a swept wing fighter type aircraft. A check with aircraft maintenance indicated that no experimental aircraft had scheduled test flights on that date.

Observations made upon the object were as follows: It was estimated to be a brilliant light source, possibly illuminating an object at an altitude of 50,000 feet. It was found that all three of the P-51 aircraft were lost during the unsuccessful attempt to make contact with the unidentified object. It was determined from later investigation that the object sighted was one of the balloons which had been released just prior to the time this object was reportedly seen.

DETAILS: This communication is a letter from the Commanding General of the 27th Air Division, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, to the Director of the Office of Intelligence, USAF, requesting this District Office to make an investigation concerning the sighting of an unidentified object over Long Beach, California, on 23 September 1951.
At the time this matter was referred to this office, the 27th Air Division had published an Intelligence Report which sets forth the following information:
On 23 September 1951, at 16:02, an object was sighted and reported over Long Beach, California, at an altitude of 50,000 feet. Four (4) F-86 were dispatched to investigate the object but were unable to reach it because of its high speed and altitude. The object was described as round, silver in color, with a constant steady rate in the vicinity. No trails or exhaust were observed, indicating that it was not a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft.
Weather balloons in the vicinity were at 30,000 feet altitude, and the object's altitude was estimated to be 20,000 feet above them, or approximately 50,000 feet.
The incident that was sighted was observed by Captain J. R. STEELE, Chief Controller, ADCC, from Mojave, and verified by Major MEILZE, Operations Officer, 732nd AC&W Squadron.
Major MEILZER checked towards ATC for any known flights in the area at that time, and no conventional aircraft had been confirmed that could be this object. Captains IOYEM, UYEOKA, and George AFB Operations had been alerted and reported that no flights were in the area.
Major MANUSSEIER, OIC of the 729th AC&W Squadron, located at Edwards AFB, whose squadrons cover the area, stated that no activity till 2000 hours had been experienced with T-33 and X-F6 N.A.D.C. The Boeing with the D-558, and Northrop with the X-3, had been grounded for the day.

The flight that was witnessed by Mr. Harvey and others was described to the balloon as a "major." MIZER also spoke to CAPTAIN HARVEY, one of the pilots who sighted the object (see enclosed statement), who stated the object appeared to be circular when he sighted it and not going "too fast." 

STATEMENT
23 September 1951

On 25 September 1951 at approximately 0910 ST a bogie was sighted by Capt James H. Harvey, USAF. When we sighted this bogie, it appeared to be over 20,000 feet in the vicinity of March Air Force Base.

When 13,000 feet and above, the bogie appeared to be between 15,000 and 22,000 feet and also appeared to be a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft. He was also noted to be in a constant orbit.

1. The object, first sighted, was observed to travel due North for some 100 miles and then South for another 100 miles, according to numerous witnesses. It was described as a round, bright, shiny object, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and traveling at an estimated speed of 1500 to 2000 miles per hour. 

2. Special Agent ARTHUR J. MAKOILE made inquiry at the following locations in an effort to determine if they were conducting any experimental aircraft on 23 September 1951:

Northrop Aircraft Company, Hawthorne, California
North American Aviation, Inc., Inglewood, California
Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc., El Segundo, California
Lockheed Aircraft Company, Burbank, California
Hughes Aircraft Company, Culver City, California

It was found that none of these companies was test flying any experimental aircraft on the date this object was seen. The above companies are under contract to the U.S. Air Forces and U.S. Navy.

6. Special Agent THOMAS J. McKARLY made inquiry at the consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation, San Diego, California, and they advised that, although they were presently working on experimental aircraft, they did not conduct any flights on 23 September 1951.

7. Colonel C. E. JACKSON, Air Force Engineering Field Office, 5500 Hollywood, Los Angeles, advised that he knew of no experimental aircraft being flown by any manufacturers in this area on the date in question. He stated that practically all USAF experimental aircraft would be under his cognizance and he knew of none being flown on this date.

8. Special Agent BEDFORD M. LEAKE interviewed Major KENNETH T. BROOKS, Detachment Commander, U.S. Weather Bureau, Long Beach, California. He claimed that a weather balloon is released by his station at 5:00 am daily and that this balloon was released on the morning of 23 September 1951 and that, due to mechanical difficulties, contact with the balloon was lost at 12,900 feet per minute and was traveling toward the general North, Easterly, and was lost from sight.

10:20 - Major BROOKS said that this balloon at 33,000 feet would be about 20-24 miles from the Long Beach Station, and would be over the ocean, some 20 miles off the Long Beach shore.

11:20 - As approximate 7 x 5 x 9 inches white, glossy cardboard box was received in a small, white, glossy cardboard box approximately 13 x 8 x 4 inches under cover of Registered Mail addressed to MR. T. R. NELLON, General Services Meteorologist, Hancock Field, Santa Maria, California, and his advise was that it contained photographs further balloons on 23 September 1951, and on-and-off again on 22 September 1951. (CCY pas time, 22 September 1951) and was released at 1522 hours (0705 Zulu Time, 22 September 1951) which was relieved to be related to this matter.

The standard procedure to be followed on any incident of this nature requires:
1. That the course of the balloons would depend upon the wind velocity and the altitude of the balloons, that the observation as to the objects traveling in a southwest direction, which was the case of Santa Maria, which is 175 miles North and West of Long Beach, and is south to Long Beach. That the balloon of 50,000 feet was the same as the one observed.
2. Special Agent THOMAS MC ARDLE was advised by Lt. Commander Dr. C. WEST, Weather Station Officer, to the effect that his station on 23 September 1951 released a balloon which attained an altitude of some 60,000 feet before it burst. San Diego is approximately 150 miles south of Long Beach.
3. All of the above weather officers stated that there was no possible
ability that the 24-58 object sighted were any of these balloons which had been released, however each stated that it was determined that this was identified as a project balloon.
4. This matter was coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Los Angeles, The Office of Naval Intelligence in Los Angeles, and the Counter Intelligence Corps, Fort MacArthur, California. None of these agencies had received any information indicating any identification or relation to this matter.

MARCH AIR FORCE BASE - 23 SEPTEMBER 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT
The first report of this incident, which appeared in Status Report No. 1, proved to be incomplete and misleading. Further investigation has corrected the discrepancies and the following account of the incident is considered to be accurate:

At approximately 0700 PST, two F-86 aircraft were scrambled from George Air Force Base, California, on a routine training flight. The flight was vectored to the position of the UFO by the GCI (Ground Control Intercept) controller. The pilots reported to GCI that they observed an unidentified object high at 12,000 feet. The object could not be acquired on radar. The pilots made three attempts to make visual contact with the object but were unable to do so. The object was described as being in a left orbit at about 4,000 ft. The object could not be engaged.

At approximately 0800 PST, four additional F-86 aircraft were scrambled from March Air Force Base to continue the search. The object was now observed to be flying at approximately 11,000 ft, and was moving at a speed estimated to be between 600-700 knots. The flight leader was able to close to within 6,000 yards of the object, but reported that he could only see it intermittently due to the high background noise level. The flight leader reported the color of the object as silver and bright in appearance.

The second element of the flight, noted as Flight AI, on the aircraft, observed the object soon after take-off, but were unable to make visual contact. The object was described as being round in shape, with what appeared to be protrusions on the sides. Bright exhaust trails or light beams were observed to break off the attempted intercept and return to their base. This flight, too, was unable to engage the object.

No more intercepts were attempted. At no time was the object observed on the radar screen nor was it reported to be observed visually from the ground.

STATEMENT
11 December 1957

1. Captain Harold E. Fischer (Ret'd), on the 23rd of September 1957, reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object near PEAK, California. The object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes and was described as having a silvery, color-like aluminum. It had a pointed leading edge and was observed to accelerate rapidly and then slow to a fast speed. The object was estimated to be 43,000 feet altitude at a slant range of 9000 feet. It was observed to have low-level flight characteristics.

2. Q. What action did you take when you observed this object?
A. We merely observed it. It was some distance from our aircraft and we had no means of intercepting it.

3. Q. Did you acknowledge your message ?
A. Yes.

4. Q. Did you hear any further alarms being directed by KILL Bear ?
A. No.

5. Q. What time was this ?
A. Approximately 0925.

6. Q. Did you see any other military a/c in the vicinity ?
A. None.

7. Q. Were you in radio communication with any other aircraft in the vicinity ?
A. No.

8. Q. Who else, in your particular flight, observed this object ?
A. Captain Harry, Major Buchanan(transferred to Korea), and Captain Goebbel(killed in Korea).

9. Q. What was the nature of your discussion when the object was sighted ?
A. We discussed its altitude, speed, and direction of flight.

UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED
Q. Why couldn't you?
A. Under the circumstances, it was high and we were suffering from natural oxygen depletion. This object maneuvered in a southerly direction during your attempt to intercept it.
Q. What happened when you attempted to intercept?
A. We had maneuvered into position to attempt to intercept but this object seemed to sense our proximity and took evasive action by accelerating to an extremely high speed and altitude which prevented our intercepting it.
Q. What area and what altitude?
A. In the vicinity of SAN ANTONIO PEAK, ALT: 13,500FT.
Q. Do you know if there were any other interceptors air borne at the same time?
A. Yes. Two others from George A.F.B.
Q. Separate flights?
A. Yes, separate flights.
Q. Do you know if they were aware of the proximity of this object?
A. No. However, they had sighted it at Long Beach and they had also attempted to intercept.
Q. Can you give us the sequences of vectors if any given you by AGC or any other such agencies?
A. There were no vectors given by Ground Control because this object was not reflected in the radar scope.
Q. Do you know if your flight was observer kildar's scope?
A. I don't know. But it is my opinion they did.
Q. Have you ever pursued a UFO before?
A. Yes, and they have given us a position fix.
Q. What do you think your object at sight could have been, bearing and its behavior?
A. It is my opinion it was a free weather balloon, influenced by upper air currents.

A. No. 
Q. Did Control instruct you to do so?
A. No.
Q. Did you lose sight of object at any time?
A. No.
Q. How long did you remain in area with object?

Transcribing the text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

The F-86's were unable to climb to the estimated altitude of the object due to the fact that they were carrying external fuel tanks and elected not to jettison them. 

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION 

At 0700 PST a radiosonde balloon was released from the Long Beach Municipal Airport. The balloon was lost at 0741 PST, and the signal was lost 30 miles from the airport, due to a malfunction of the radar at the tracking station. A coincidence, with the bearing of 95° true, due to a malfunction of the radar at the tracking station. Assuming the balloon would have been at approximately 40,000 ft. at the time of loss, and the object at this altitude they will be relatively consistent in direction. Assuming a relative constant altitude of 40,000 ft, the object would have been above the radiosonde (the balloon lost at 40,000 ft. was 20° at 1 knot) the possible flight path of the object.

The original sighting by flight personnel could very possibly have been the radiosonde balloon. The description of the object as appearing like the exhaust of a jet is unknown but was probably color 40,000 ft. Apparently, ten miles wide by 50,000 ft. could have been the radiosonde balloon and that it wasn't the object at all. The apparent movement could have been wind shifts but these are not a great deal that it is doubtful if it could have been the object.

Referring to the ground track of flight 3-a, if a 50 knt wind at 30,000 ft. the balloon would be at 15° on the overlay. The balloon would be at 11° on the overlay, and probably be at an altitude of 15,000 to 30,000 ft. This puts the altitude of the balloon within the range of the object. Examining the altitude of the balloon, the altitudes could have been misjudged and the balloon the object spotted.

The interested interpret by flight 3-b cannot be explained. If the ground track given by the leader of flight 3-b is correct, it is very doubtful that the flight could have seen the object. It is known that they flew beneath the object for a minute, and if it is assumed that they saw beneath the object for 30 minutes, and the object could not have been above 40,000 ft. the illusion of a tram.

III. CONCLUSIONS
With the information available, it cannot be concluded that the object was not a Radiosonde Balloon. The discrepancies in the description, such as the maneuvering capabilities and the size, indicate that the orbiting of the object was an illusion due to the relative motion between the balloon and the aircraft. It is concluded that the object was very possibly a Radiosonde Balloon.

STATEMENT
11 December 1951

1. Captain Omar J. Reichman, states: On the morning of 23 September, 1951, I was one of an element of two that scrambled at approximately 0700 hours. The nature of the scramble was to intercept an unidentified object over Long Beach Bay, California, arriving at approximately 30,000 feet. I was port orbit over position (118°40' W--33°20' N). I took up a Vector to Long Beach range at approximately 90° heading. At a period 30 seconds from Long Beach range, I say this object at 13 1/2 high above me. It appeared to be in a left orbit of an undetermined object.
At above 30,000-feet altitude, It continued on a left orbit and passed directly over me, port to starboard. It appeared to have about 15-15 yards or wingspan, and the speed of 450 and 500 mph. The prosecution of the object seemed very far away.
2. Did the pilot of your element also eye this object?
A. Yes. (Name: Jack C. Mace, Captain,)
Q. Did you attract his attention to the object?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. Did you satisfy yourself he saw and recognized object as pointed out?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. How did you accomplish this?
A. Over the radio, V.H.F.
Q. Is that on the same channel as Kill Deer?
A. Yes, that is the same information they reported, but they did not have object on the Radar scope.

A. Yes.
Q. You are quite certain kill Dear Rogered you, but it could not have reflected?
A. Right. At the time I called in my position.
Q. What was your position at the time?
A. It was approaching 90 degrees. However, no one was in sight. 
Q. Did you notice any swimmers from this object?
A. No. It continued in a left orbit.
Q. Were you in vicinity of Mario at any time?
A. I was flying at the time and was not able to observe anything that did not seem normal, and regulations do not permit me to divulge that information.
Q. Did you try to intercept it?
A. No. The instructions were not to try to intercept it.
Q. Are you positive kill Dear was aware of object, and also of your such shortages?
A. Yes, they were, because they had factored the next flight.
Q. In your own opinion, what do you think the object could have been?
A. I am of the opinion it was an A/C of some sort, being in a state of such maneuver.
Q. Why was there so much interest and attempted to resolve it.
A. Yes, because of curiosity and attempting to resolve it. I also reported it on landing. Capt Harvey made a written report.
Q. Did you lose sight of the object.
A. No. I left because of fuel shortages, and object was still in view.

Transcription of the text in the document:

TD-2/lt Col Friend
Request for UFO Information (Disc 950-623)
Re USAF
ATIC-63 (Major Hurt)
Wash 25 DC

1. The attached letter from Lt. Paul Goldman requests information regarding a "saucer" incident which occurred in the Long Beach, California area on 7 May 1952.

2. The following information is furnished to assist in this request:

a. The report of this incident was forwarded to ATIC under UFO case file No. 4614.
b. The details of the case are contained in the report and are summarized as follows:

3. The Laroto AFB, Texas, official which received the call on 7 December 1952 was Lt Colonel_____?_____ who directed the Reese AFB, Lubbock, Texas, operations officer, Capt ___?___, to investigate.

4. At 1100 on 22 July 1952 the incident occurred. Observers estimated the object's size as 30-50 feet in diameter, speed as "terrific", and duration of sighting as 2-3 minutes.

5. The object was sighted at about 2000 feet altitude and emitted a brilliant white light. When the object disappeared, the area was illuminated as if by a searchlight. No sound was heard.

6. On 3 March 1953 an analysis of the report was made and evaluated as an "unidentified" under Project Blue Book.

The text appears to be a summary of an investigation into a UFO sighting that occurred on May 7, 1952 in the Long Beach, California area. The document provides details about the sighting, such as the size, speed, and duration of the object, as well as the observers' accounts and the subsequent investigation by the Air Force.

AI-GENERATED TEXT:

"1S Lt 6-9714 Air Force Base, Box"
"This report is submitted in compliance with Air Force procedure covering the investigation of unidentified flying objects reported in the vicinity of Long Beach, California on September 7, 1951.  

On this date a complaint was received from Mr. Wilbur E. Hatfield, a resident of Long Beach, California, reporting two unidentified airborne objects observed in the sky over Long Beach at approximately 1600 hours.

Investigation revealed that the object reported was a silver colored circular disk, approximately 15 feet in diameter, flying at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet and at a speed estimated to be 600 mph.  The object was observed for approximately 1 minute and then disappeared from sight.

Efforts to determine the origin of the object were unsuccessful.  No known aircraft were reported in the vicinity at the time of the sighting.

It is strongly recommended that this incident be filed under Unidentified Flying Objects, Project Blue Book."
