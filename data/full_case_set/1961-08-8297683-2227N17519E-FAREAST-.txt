United States Air Force
Dear Sir:
This refers to our report to you dated 22 Sept 55 of a sighting of an object approximating the description of a flying saucer, observed at this location on 17 Aug 55 at 0300 hours. We have been able to obtain some additional information on this incident and would like to pass it on for your consideration. 
The details of the original sighting are as follows:
On 17 Aug 55 at 0300 hours, an airman on duty at this location observed a relatively bright, bluish-white light moving across the sky from east to west at an estimated speed of approximately 500-700 mph. He observed the object for approximately 2 minutes before it disappeared from sight. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. 
This is all the additional information we can provide at this time. If you have any further questions, please let me know.
