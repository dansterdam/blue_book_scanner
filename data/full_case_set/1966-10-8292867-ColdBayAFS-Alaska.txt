2. LOCATION: Cold Bay AFS, Alaska
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual
7. COURSE: SW
8. PHOTO: X No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Unidentified
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Witness reported observing a white colored object approach the runway at approximately 50-75 feet above ground. The object was turned up the better determine the object. The object then accelerated so fast down the runway. The object was unable to be located after it climbed. The light sustained high brightness and was described as a larger than ordinary light source as it appeared. The light was observed for about three seconds and was turned and climbed. There were no reportable aircraft in the area; however, it is possible that a special mission is operationally sensitive and may have been the source.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  20 DEC 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
ANSWER: I have been trying to write up my sighting as clearly as I can. As you can readily see, I did not dially log. I do not recall the exact time. If you feel it's important, I feel sure you can obtain a copy of the station and requesting a copy.  
At the time of the sighting I was at work and I was an air carrier estimating Cold Bay Airport is located thinking an approach. It was dark and I had no visual check of the runway.  As I looked to the north end of the runway I saw a light come down and pass in a route behind the hill.  It was a bright, metallic light and as it came close it gave an approach that I didn't know any land vehicle. The light was moving up and down, then the light continued and I lost sight of it.  
As the light reappeared, it was a little north of my position I reached around and flicked on the lights to my starboard side (I) (could not see the cabin because the reflected light of the object as I was in turning to check the object). The object was metallic in appearance and was still on a cruise approximately the same altitude. 
In a second or two, (elevation over 350 ft), the object moved off and was lost in the distance.  It seemed to level off and the star like it was just taking off.  At this time it was lost from sight.  Called Cold Bay "radar,  At this time we did not have a proper system."  They advised they did not pick up anything.
