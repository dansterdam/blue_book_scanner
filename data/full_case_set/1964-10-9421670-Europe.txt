EVALUATION REPORT
Analysis of Suspected Meteorite

REPORT NO.: MAY 64-24
PROJECT NO.: 6900-2  
DATE: 12 October 1964
TYPE EVALUATION: SPEC ID:
ITEM SERIAL NO:

I. PURPOSE:
Analysis of suspected meteorite for identification.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. The sample was submitted for analysis and assigned Analytical Branch No. 4-1571.
2. The sample was chipped and pieces sent to X-ray diffraction for scattering pattern, infrared for spectrum between 2.5µ - 40µ, and spectrographic analysis for an emission spectrum.
a. X-ray diffraction gave no pattern.
b. Infrared spectrum showed no organic material present, but a spectrum similar to an inorganic silicate.
c. Spectrographic analysis gave the following results:

III. CONCLUSION: The sample appears to be a form of inorganic silicate and therefore, not a form of meteorite.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS: None, data merely submitted.

1. Dr. Erik Bergstrom, AMRC Chief Scientist, on a recent trip to Europe picked up a small bit of material allegedly part of a larger meteorite. The object was discussed with this letter.

2. In the event the object is of interest to you, request you arrange for detailed analysis and providing the results of such analysis. If you desire this material to be turned over to the School of Mines, Socorro, New Mexico for analysis outside of our facilities, please advise.

Ludwigshafen Dun 15 May 1964
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting in Ludwigshafen, Germany on 15 May 1964
1. At approximately 2215 hours local time on 15 May 1964, a bright round light was observed in the sky over Ludwigshafen, Germany. The light was estimated to be about 10-15 meters in diameter and was moving in a zigzag pattern at an estimated speed of 100-150 knots. The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before disappearing from view.
2. Several reliable witnesses observed the object, including a police officer, a railway worker, and two private citizens. All witnesses gave consistent accounts of the object's appearance and behavior.
3. No other information is available at this time. This report is being forwarded to higher headquarters for further investigation.

TRANSLATION
Rüsheim, 5 Sep 64

Dear Dr. Steinhoff:

In reference to our telephone conversation of 3 September 1964, please find attached hereto the promised prior stone.

It has a degree of hardness of 6-6, contains quartz, and is a pulverized state can be utilized as a mafic, including silica and other radiation.

I am convinced that the examination of this specimen could lead to an interesting result, especially in view of the fact that the world's best research facilities are at your disposal.

Should you have an interest in other materials, I can also make these available to you.

I personally am not in possession of these meteor stones; however, I can act as the go-between to procure them.

Respectfully yours,
