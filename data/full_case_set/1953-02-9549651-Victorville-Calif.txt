3. Weather conditions at the time of the observation were clear, with unlimited ceiling and visibility.

4. The witness was interviewed and provided a statement concerning the details of the observation. The witness appeared to be reliable and was able to provide a detailed description of the object.

At 1900, OCT. 2 February 1953, I was in the CFC gunner's position of a B-26 type aircraft, number 9365, flying at an altitude of 25,000 feet. I was searching for fighter aircraft which were in the area. I saw a B-52 type aircraft at three (3) o'clock high.

As this aircraft passed, I noticed a silver object in its wake. I called on the interphone, "Does anyone see that silver object behind that B-52?"

I was answered by my right gunner saying, "Yes," which was one of us could identify the object. We both took gun camera pictures to confirm the sighting.

The object looked like a silver disk, first showing its circular side and then the flat side. It first appeared high at three (3) o'clock and was lost sight of four-thirty (4:30). I watched until it went out of sight.

At 1900, 27 February 1953, I was occupying the right gunner's position of a B-50 type aircraft No. 9365 on a routine training mission. During this period we were under a simulated attack from four (4) F-86 type fighter aircraft from George AFB, Victorville, California. I was searching for fighters in my assigned quadrant when a light jet aircraft appeared at three (3) o'clock high crossing over course to right at (2) o'clock. As I observed this aircraft, I noticed a silver ball on the right wing. The ball was stationary and we left it behind within three (3) minutes. The ball appeared to be made of polished metal, silver or chrome. It appeared to be small, and due to this fact I could not notice any flat surfaces.
During the filming, the sequences of pictures with my G.E.A.F. camera so that only the object remained. In the second sequence I turned the vehicle on and placed the center dot on the left side of the object.
