As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 11 Day 6 Month 1967 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

For the past 2 years, I have seen an unusual flying craft hovering at low altitude in the northwestern part of Kilborne, Illinois. The craft is round or disc-shaped, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and has a dull metallic surface. It makes no sound and moves with no visible means of propulsion. The sightings have occurred on several occasions, usually on clear, moonlit nights between 10 PM and 2 AM. The craft appears to hover silently for 5-10 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight. I have not reported these incidents previously as I was unsure of their significance and did not wish to be ridiculed. However, I feel the sightings may be of interest to your investigators and would be willing to provide additional details if requested.

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass to show the direction in which you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Transcription of the text in the document:

JUN 8 1967

Dear [REDACTED],

Your recent unidentified observation, detailed investigation revealed the planet Venus was probably responsible for most of the sightings. Venus, with a similar magnitude of approximately -4, was very prominent in the sky. On March 6, 1967 at 6:30 p.m., Venus would have been on an azimuth bearing of 290 degrees at an elevation of 15 degrees.

You mentioned throughout the report that the object often appeared as a bright, only brilliant object. It appeared to move at times and change colors. When stars or planets are viewed low on the horizon, as Venus was in this instance, their light can be distorted by the earth's atmosphere causing them to appear to move and change colors.

The earth's atmosphere actually acts as a prism which refracts and causes the incoming rays to be refracted by the atmosphere. The display of lights and colors on the horizon are then looking through this prism-like layer of air. This, in effect, causes an astronomical phenomenon to occur, due to the distortion in the sky. 

From the information submitted, it does appear that Venus was responsible for the majority of the sightings. The Air Force has thoroughly investigated the occurrence for the months of March and April, describing observations similar to yours.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
BARNETT B. YOUNG

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to "Mrs. Johnson" from someone at the Department of Defense regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) being sighted in the area.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mrs. Johnson,

President Johnson has asked that I reply to your letter concerning the unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which are being sighted in your area.

Within the Department of Defense the Air Force has the responsibility of investigating UFOs reported to it and determining whether or not these objects constitute a threat to our national security. This program is carried out under the designation Project Blue Book. The enclosed brochure explains our program since its inception in 1947.

Blue Book personnel at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base inform me that they have not received any UFO reports from your area. However, March 8-10, they received many from Gladesbur, Moline, and Monmouth. These sightings were determined to be hot air balloons.

I have enclosed an AF Form 164 which is used in officially reporting a sighting to the Air Force. If you will complete this form and return it in the attached envelope, we will attempt to evaluate the sightings in your area. We are not testing "boundless planes from outer space."

I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Kilbourne's U.F.O. ??
By Ted Connolly
The incident described occurred in a rural area near Kilbourne, Illinois on March 9, 1967. I was approached that evening and asked if I had seen anything unusual in the sky. I had at first passed this incident off as nothing but peculiar, but having learned more about it since, I now feel that it is deserving of investigation.
It was approximately 8:00 p.m. and I was walking along the driveway to my home. The sky was clear and dark and I was looking up at the stars. Suddenly, the sky seemed to be changed from a bright blue-white color to a dark, reddish hue. This change occurred in a matter of a few seconds. I hurried into the house to get my camera, as I felt that some unusual phenomenon was occurring. When I returned outside, the sky had returned to its normal appearance. I took several photographs of the area, but they showed nothing unusual.
That evening, a neighbor, Mr. James McCord, came over and told me that he and his wife had observed a strange object in the sky at about the same time I had noticed the change in color. They described it as a disc-shaped, metallic object which hovered above the trees for several minutes. It was a bright red-orange color and appeared to change color slightly as it moved. They said that when they first saw it, it was directly overhead, but it then moved slowly to the east and finally disappeared from sight.
This photo was magnified approximately 200 times the size it was viewed.

Transcription of the text in the document:

On the night of March 9, 1967 at approximately 9:45, our dog, who is getting rather old, was out barking, a rather anxious, loud barking. We looked out, and there was a very bright object in the sky to the west of our barren farm. The object was brighter than any star or planet in the sky, yet not quite as bright as Venus, approximately 30 miles west of us.

At first changing color, and then it stood still. Then the light went out, and the outline of the bottom of the object could be seen, but the light came back on. For a while there was a reddish glow around the edge, and then the light went completely off, and it seemed to disappear. The outline could no longer be seen.

We watched this for some time, probably 30 minutes, and then my husband and two neighbors (Clarence and Ray) came in, and since they also saw this, I am reporting it. It landed just behind the trees, and at that point, we could see nothing more.
