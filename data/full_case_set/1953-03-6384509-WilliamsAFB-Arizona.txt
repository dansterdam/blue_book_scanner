The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO sighting, along with detailed descriptions of the object's appearance and motion. There are no human faces or identities visible in the image.

16. a. Sound - NOISY
b. Color - SILVER

17. The sketch shows an object with a round shape, a trail behind it, and labels indicating it was traveling from north to south.

18. The edges of the object were:
a. Fuzzy or blurred
d. Sharply outlined

19. According to the text, the object was either single or part of a larger group, and it was larger and traveled further away than the observer could determine its exact size or details. The text indicates uncertainty about the nature and characteristics of the object.

Text output:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound NOISY
b. Color SILVER

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the driving direction the object was moving.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line to illustrate how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows two larger sketches, one depicting a road with buildings and trees on the sides, and another smaller sketch showing a landscape with a road leading into the distance.

There is no photograph present in this image.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
