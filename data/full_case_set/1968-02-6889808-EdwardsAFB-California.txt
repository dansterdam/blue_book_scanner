11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
At 0650 hrs on 6 Feb 1968, Observers (two) sighted an object at about 70 deg elevation in the south. The object was estimated to be about 30 deg in diameter and larger than a commercial jet airliner. The object was reddish in color and brighter than a commercial jet airliner. The object moved westerly and was observed for about 6 hrs and 50 minutes when it could no longer be seen because of daylight.
Comments: At time of sighting 0650 Jupiter was in the south at an elevation of about 70 deg and an azimuth of about 180 deg. Jupiter was at a magnitude of -2.1.

The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass diagram showing the cardinal directions and their abbreviations. The bottom illustration appears to be a sketch or drawing depicting a person standing in a landscape with a curved horizon line.

SA. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH YOU FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "?" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE ANY UNCERTAINTY IN THE COMPASS DIRECTION.

In the sketch below, place an "X" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen. Connect the "X" with a line to show the movement of the phenomenon between "X" and "Y". That is, schematically show whether the motion was straight or curved.
