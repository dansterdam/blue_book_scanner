PAGE FOUR R-JRAP 23 ARRIVED AT RUSHVILLE MORNING OF 30 DEC. AND INTERVIEWED ALL WITNESSES EXCEPT MR. SMITH WHO WAS OUT OF TOWN. MRS. SMITH VIEWED THE OBJECT FROM HER WINDOW AND WHEN SHE OBSERVED IT EXPERIENCED A SHARP STINGING OF THE EYES AND SMELLED A STRONG ACID TYPE ODOR. SHE CALLED SHERIFF HILL WHO ARRIVED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AND OBSERVED THE OBJECT. HE SAID THE OBJECT WAS SIMILIAR TO TEAR GAS. HIS INVENTORY OF HIS TEAR GAS SUPPLY SHOWED NONE MISSING ACCORDING TO HIS RECORDS A TEAR GAS SHELL HAD BEEN TEST FIRED FROM THE SHERIFF'S CAR APPROXIMATELY FOUR BLOCKS AWAY AND NOTHING UNUSUAL NOTED BY THE PERSONS LIVING ADJACENT TO A FEDERAL HIGHWAY WHICH IS HEAVILY TRAVELLED.

RECEIVED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AND NOTICED THE ODOR AND A SUDDEN STARTING OF THE MOTOR AS HE SAID SUBJECT HE WAS SIMILAR TO TEAR GAS: HIS INVENTORY OF HIS TEAR GAS SUPPLY SHOWED NONE MISSING OR DAMAGED. HE PRODUCED THAT FACE AND SAID THE OTHER OBSERVERS APPROXIMATELY FOUR BLOCKS AWAY AND NOTICED NO ODOR AND NO STARTING OF THE EYES WERE ALSO NEARBY THE OBJECT LIVES ADJACENT TO A FEDERAL HIGHWAY WHICH IS HEAVILY TRAVELED LARGE TRUCKS: IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FUMES ORIGINATED FROM THE HIGHWAY AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE ODOR AND THE LIGHTED OBJECT ARE NOT ASSOCIATED. THE PRESENCE OF NUMEROUS PRIVATE AIRSTRIPS SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF RUSHVILLE PLUS THE FACT THAT MR. WAS REPORTEDLY TOLD OTHER OBSERVERS HE HAD SEEN THE SAME LIGHT BEHAVE IN THE SAME MANNER BEFORE, LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LIGHT PROBABLY WAS ON A SMALL PRIVATE AIRCRAFT WHICH
