3 to 4 people observe UFOs. The first sighting occurred around 3:30 a.m. on 10-10-66. The thing was about 600 feet in the air, shaped like a cigar, and appeared to be made of some kind of metallic material. It seemed to be in one place and then would move erratically. The observers watched it for about 10 minutes. About the same time the next morning, two more people saw the same object. This time it was about 600 feet in the air and appeared to glow. It remained stationary and then took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object did not make any sound. After this sighting, one of the observers talked to others in the area and found out that several other people had seen the same object on the same and other dates. The observers tried to take pictures but were unable to do so. There was mist or fog hanging in the air at the time of the sightings which may have effected [sic] the ability to take pictures.
