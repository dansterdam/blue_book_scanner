PROJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

CASE FILE: 6975803

LOCATION: CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS  
DATE: JUNE 6, 1960

SUMMARY:
Witness reported observing a bright, disc-shaped object maneuvering in the sky over Champaign, Illinois on June 6, 1960. The object was seen to make rapid changes in direction and speed before disappearing from view. 

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
The witness described the object as being disc-shaped, bright in appearance, and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed to make abrupt changes in direction and velocity, accelerating rapidly and then hovering momentarily before disappearing.

INVESTIGATION:
The case was investigated by the USAF Project Blue Book unit. Interviews were conducted with the witness and local authorities, but no physical evidence or corroborating sightings were obtained. The case was classified as "Unidentified" due to the witness' credible description and the lack of a conventional explanation for the observed phenomena.

CONCLUSION:
This incident remains classified as an Unidentified Flying Object due to the inability to satisfactorily explain the witness' observations through conventional means. The case warrants further investigation and analysis.
