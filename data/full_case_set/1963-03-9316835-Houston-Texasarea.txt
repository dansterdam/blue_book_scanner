There is no photograph or image present in this document page. The document appears to be a typed text report from Project Blue Book, describing an incident where a pilot at Houston International Airport spotted a similar object to one that was sighted by civilian aircraft at the same time. The report states that the aircraft numbers were not recorded by the tower operator and are therefore not available for this report. It also mentions that additional checks of the local Air Force and Air Guard squadrons and several pilots did not reveal any satellite passover or missile firing in conjunction with the sighting.
