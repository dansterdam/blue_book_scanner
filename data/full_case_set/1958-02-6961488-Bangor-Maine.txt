TRANSCRIPT OF SCANNED TEXT:

"It appears as if the saucer, to which this news clipping refers, was one of the smaller, metallic objects that have been reported to the command to the command of ATIC that indicate the existence of a fleet of flying saucers apparently circling the Earth at an altitude of about 80,000 feet. This would place them beyond the reach of our conventional aircraft.

As you know the U.S. had begun to set up a system of radar watch over the approaches to the U.S. and parts of Canada. Once the U.S., too, would undoubtedly stations of the existing continental and defense radar systems. The mght have resulted in even more terrible events such as those envisioned by Orson Welles' the broadcast of H.G. Wells' [sic] novel, "War of the Worlds." Once out in space, these craft might conduct reconnaissance and perhaps even landing on the far side of the moon or other planets to gain data useful to their home planets. More sightings were reported of another world, showing the interest of an advanced civilization here on Earth."
