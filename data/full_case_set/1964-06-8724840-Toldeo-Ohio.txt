Dear Dr. Hynek:

Your request for information by telephone is in order before we submit the official report on the sighting which occurred over Maumee, Ohio, June 12, 1964.

My initial investigation indicates that this was an extremely interesting report. We have several reliable witnesses who observed a brilliant, fast-moving object which appeared to be a solid vehicle rather than a natural phenomenon. The object was first sighted by a Mr. and Mrs. William Donahue who were driving north on Route 25 near Maumee, Ohio around 10:15 PM on June 12, 1964.

This object was sighted about five minutes later by a Mr. Andrew Busch and his wife, who were also driving north on Route 25 near Maumee. Both of these independent reports seem to corroborate each other and the descriptions are quite similar. The object was stated to be large, brilliant white in color, and traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, estimated by the witnesses to be in excess of 1,000 mph. The object made a sharp turn and quickly accelerated to the north and was soon lost from sight.

I have interviewed these witnesses and they appear to be completely reliable and credible. There is no evidence of any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting, nor is there any record of any unusual weather phenomena which could account for the observed object.

I would suggest that this report warrants further investigation. The descriptions given by the witnesses tend to rule out any conventional explanation. I would recommend that this matter be discussed further and that we arrange for an on-site investigation at the sighting location.

Please advise if you have any additional questions or require any further information.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek
Consultant, Project Blue Book

OCR SYSTEM OUTPUT:

The letter goes on at this point with an account of another witness called in the first place: I looked but there was no crash of any kind, No airplane or bird or anything, and the distance between us is less than a mile, so I would have heard or seen something if there had been a crash. As I said before, it looked to me simply like something glowing very bright and white, sort of like a star, only much bigger, that shot across the sky and then seemed to stop for a second and then go out. The only other witness lives almost directly across the street from the place on Laskey Road and she did not hear or see anything unusual either. There was no damage whatever, and the night was clear and calm, no wind or storm, and the strange light or object was only visible for a few seconds as it shot across the sky. I hope this helps to clarify what was seen and not seen. Please let me know if you need any other information.

December 16, 1964

After due analysis of the velocity of the objects mentioned in the notes and reports, I believe that the objects were not meteors, satellites, or aircraft, since the velocity indicated was too slow for any of these. The objects were observed by competent and reliable observers and the descriptions of their appearance and motion are consistent. Based upon the available data, it appears that the objects were intelligently controlled and maneuverable, and did not conform to the normal behavior of meteors, satellites, aircraft, or any other known objects. There are no logical explanations for the observed phenomena except the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial vehicles. Any connection between this and other incidents is unknown. I would recommend that this case be classified as UNIDENTIFIED.

Dear Mr. Hynek,

I hope you will give this matter your further consideration. I am quite concerned about this case and the report I made to your office. This sighting is, I believe, one of the most significant made in the Toledo area.

The field of view in the long series among an image of about 60Â° in horizontal angle. Picture No. 1 felis Arlington Avenue at an angle slightly upward from the ground. The second and third pictures were taken together with the material from the sighting.

I still felt the need was a real and the phenomenon is of great importance. I should be grateful if you would discuss this case further with me so that I may provide you with any additional information you may require. I hope to hear from you soon regarding this case.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Toledo, Ohio 43614
June 22, 1964

Dear Sirs:

My name is [REDACTED] and I am 22 years old and a graduate of the University of Detroit. I work at Radio Station [REDACTED].

Leaving the station alone the night of Saturday, June 13, 1964, along the drive over the airport field adjacent to the station, I saw strange objects in the air flying over the field. I observed them for approximately ten minutes and at a range of about 300 feet. The objects had no lights, no vapor trails, and no discernible wings or fuselage. They made no noise.

They had approximately the size and shape of the cockpits of some jet fighters that I am familiar with. There were five in a formation and I observed them move and change directions under complete control. At one point they appeared to form a cluster and then scattered.

I was very excited by what I saw. Since there was no more than this sighting that night, I waited to be sure that what I had seen was more than a transitory phenomenon. Unfortunately, I have not observed anything similar since then.

I would be grateful if you would let me know if you have any information on such sightings in the Toledo area or elsewhere. At present, I am convinced that the objects I saw were not part of any of our conventional aircraft. They appeared to be of an advanced design not known to me.

The size and maneuverability of the objects leads me to believe they were not conventional aircraft. I would appreciate your comments on this unusual sighting.

If you wish me to complete some kind of formal report, I would be happy to oblige.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]

Text extracted from the document:

31, November 1954

Toledo, Ohio 43514

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This letter follows up our telephone conversation the other evening. I also apologize for the opportunity of thanking you for the information as requested.

I'm also enclosing a duplicate for your own files.

I would very much appreciate if you would again continue of the longer letter you mentioned on the phone. That this there must be a perfectly natural explanation for the sighting lighting and motion, but I would hope that you can give me the latest details on the subject. My interest is in the theory and angular rates of motion, relative placement of lights, etc.

It occurs on November 8, that this lights you saw were actually quite some distance away, and moving rather rapidly, but towards the horizon very low. Just returning to more normal height. These lights were off, and certainly no attempt is intended to making an absolute statement.

It occasionally happens also, that distant objects, such as (a) church steeple) silhouetted against the sky, may present a flickering appearance, like to some observers as moving lights. Short, I am asking whether you have there is any chance that this might have been a mistaken observation in which moving lights a considerable distance gave the impression of nearer and faster motion which did not in fact occur. Of course, and I'm advancing this only as a suggestion.

Please read this letter carefully and please don't forget to send along a copy of the letter you mentioned.

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]
J. Allen Hynek

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Thank you for your card of November 18. I hope this letter finds you still interested in the matter you discussed with me. At your request, I have thoroughly reviewed our files and find that in the report you referred to, there was no photograph or other exhibit on the subject incident. It is sometime difficult for us to arrive at a solution to the enigma of UFO's without the assistance of photographic or other physical evidence. If you have any chance to take a photograph or other exhibit on your next observation, it would be most helpful.

Thanks again for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS

DECEMBER 20, 1954

Dear Mr. XXXXX,

Thank you very much for your recent letter and the information you sent. The publicity made quite a stir, and as a result we've received a number of similar reports from other parts of the country at various times. The possible explanation would be that we are encountering their activities locally since people seem to have seen similar objects at various places simultaneously. Right now, we are trying to do something to work on. Sightings like these are indeed very puzzling, as you reported, and we too are trying to find out what causes them. I hope, however, that we can find one, and that it will be a satisfactory, down-to-earth explanation. Satisfactory or not, we'll try to find out definitely what causes them.

With respect to the photographs, I would very much like to have one or two views of the scene. The number I will leave to you since you can best determine whether additional ones are desirable. I will gladly reimburse you for any expenses incurred, as I realize that the cost of obtaining additional photographs is not necessary and so cost. I will cover that personally. I would think that if we could see some of the additional photographs it would help us very much in our attempt to get to the bottom of this. But a few snapshots of this area would be helpful. So please go ahead and I will cover any costs involved within this request.

Your mention of Fate magazine being published in Evanston is a pure coincidence. There seems to be no connection whatsoever. There seems to be some sort of an occult bookshop in the northern part of Evanston which has apparently been the source of some publicity here and there. I do think their stories and so on are a bit far-fetched.

Thank you again for your response. Let's keep in touch; you may get more information, and I will, of course, let you know if we get any place with this.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter on official letterhead from J. Allen Hynek, the Director of Project Blue Book, addressed to Mr. [redacted] in Toledo, Ohio. The letter is dated 8 January 1965 and discusses the sighting of UFOs in Toledo on June 13, 1964.

Transcription of the text:

8 January 1965

Mr. [redacted]
Toledo, Ohio 43614  
Dear Mr. [redacted],

The sighting of June 13, 1964 could have been caused by a luminescent or great metallic-appearing cloud cover a few inches in diameter. The appearance as a nearby, stationary celestial object was no doubt an illusion due to atmospheric distortion.

Illumination is a problem, however, and it appears that you could not have seen details or color. The fact that the object appeared to change from stationary to apparently moving and back again, is characteristic of atmospheric effects and not a solid, physical object.

I am sorry that this does not fit your observation, but this is the only explanation that seems plausible to me. If you could provide any additional details that might clarify the sighting, I would be glad to consider them.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

18 February 1955

Private *** Company G 
Fourth TNG Regiment
Second Platoon
Fort Dix, New Jersey 08640

Dear Private ***,

Thank you for your recent letter. I hope you are still alive despite your rigorous training, and that before I will get the photographs as mentioned in your letter, where the sighting occurred and also the pictures you made concerning about the latter times.

The pictures will, in any case, be helpful to get the location well in hand. I assess with your about the time of the sighting, but I am still puzzled about the fact that the red light apparently blinked in synchronism with the blinking lights or on the towers, or whatever they were.

The very best of luck to you in your boot training and please don't forget the pictures as soon as you get them.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

Dear Dr. Hynek,

Finally! The photos are numbered on the back. I hope some of them will prove interesting. They were taken on the day, I am afraid, that the photographer (alleged with half-hearted camera) was underexposed.

Between 2 and 3 are a few taken from close up where I first sighted the objects. (These numbers 1, 2, and 3 correspond to those on the other type numbered photos.) I can't seem to see the objects. Picture number 4 taken later shows nothing but the objects have finally dissolved. The effects finally formed and disappeared. Please let me know if you may have any comments.

Sincerely,

The text in the image is the handwritten letter described above. There are no other textual elements present in the image.
