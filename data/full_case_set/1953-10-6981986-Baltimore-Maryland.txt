COMMENTS (From the intelligence collectors in the field. Your comment, guidance and criticism are greatly appreciated. Definite and detailed evaluations will lead to improvements in the quality of intelligence reporting.)

Reference 647th AC&W Squadron UFOB Report ACC 1162, 28 October 1953. Information required by telegram AFON ATLAS 10 LI425, 3 November 1953 is as follows:

1. Length of observation; Pfc. Rails, 5 minutes. Mr. Greene, 7 minutes, Angular velocity sustained in sight at 35 degrees elevation. 6328 mill in azimuth. Out of sight at 70 degrees of elevation, 3328 mills in azimuth. Object estimated to be at approximately 16,000 feet by Pfc. Rails. After further interrogation, both observers stated the sighting could not have been a jet aircraft.

2. Corrections to 647th AC&W Squadron ACC 1162 are made as follows:
Par 2c should read, "Pfc. Rails indicated that increased intensity of orange light blotted out red lights as object approached. All lights disappeared abruptly after object passed overhead." Par 5 should read, "PK 1923." Par 8 should indicate that heavy haze conditions were present and had existed for a period of at least three weeks. 

3. Statement of Capt. Robert B. Warren, Direction Center Chief, AFSC 1635 - 1221, Rated Pilot: "It is a common policy of pilots flying into the Washington area to turn on landing lights prior to entering traffic patterns, particularly during hazy conditions. Red lights could well be the passing light and navigational light installed on conventional aircraft. In this case, all lights would disappear abruptly after the aircraft passed overhead of the observers. This station has no recorded
