"Good Thunder, Minnesota
June 13, 1955

Project-same", wingate-peterson field.
Ican't this - my husband asked me to report to you; - As we were returning home from visiting friends. On Monday P.M. between 2:30 P.M. and 3:00 P.M., on Highway U.S. 36, driving west from Rochester, we saw something to the left front of us â€” as of a silver flash. Like we sometimes see when the sun strikes a plane - but, as we watched, there were no plane in sight - just the silver flash.
We thought someone else might have seen it also and reported to you - would be interested in any information you could give me.

Yours truly -
Mrs. ***"

This image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper clipping or article. The article discusses a Navy commander's report of seeing two saucer-shaped objects, 20 inches in diameter, that were outrunning a Navy rocket. The commander, Robert B. McLaughlin, is quoted as saying that these "disks are space ships from another planet, operated by animate, intelligent beings."

OTHER PLANETS SEND SAUCERS, NAVY MAN SAYS
NEW YORK, Feb. 22 (UP)--A Navy commander said today he is convinced "these disks are space ships from another planet, operated by animate, intelligent beings."
Comdr. Robert B. McLaughlin, guided missiles expert and current skipper of the destroyer Bristol, told of two saucers, 20 inches in diameter, outrunning a Navy rocket.
In an article in the March issue of True magazine, the commander, identified by the magazine as "an annapolis graduate and head of the Navy unit working on classified projects at White Sands Proving Grounds, N.M.," said he is convinced "these disks are space ships from another planet, operated by animate, intelligent beings."
