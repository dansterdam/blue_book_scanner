Dear Major Quintanilla:

I was out of the office all last week, hence the unconscionable delay in getting this letter off to you. But I (all of us) do want you to know how very much we appreciate your appearance before the American Society of Newspaper Editors.

I'm sure you must have had a great interest of the editors in what you had to say. I myself heard many favorable comments on your performance.

As we had anticipated, the scientists got what little heat there was from the questioners. But it meant a great deal to me to make an occasional statement that you were a good sport to take part and give us the official word.

Once again, thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to help educate the press. You did us much good.

Faithfully yours,
Newbold Noyes

Just a line to suggest that if you have a text of prepared remarks for the ASNE next week, and can get it mimeographed, it would be helpful to have a dozen or so copies for the press room at the Shoreham.

Not necessary, but it does insure that if the reporters want to quote you they will do so accurately.

Dear General LeBailly:

As program chairman for this year's meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which takes place here at the Shoreham Hotel on April 20-22, I've been discussing the problem with Dr. Condon, Dr. Hynek, Dr. Menzel and the like, and trying to keep Major Quintinella's gang at arm's length. In wondering whether the Blue Book officers, preferably Major Quintinella, take part in a session.

What I hope to come up with is a non-kooky, balanced panel representing both total-and not-so-skeptics, and to have Dr. Condon or the presentors make a moderately brief statement about the state of the art. He has indicated an interest in taking part if I can work out such a presentation.

If you think this is a possibility, I can of course approach Major Quintinella directly, but thought I'd better ask your counsel first.

As you probably know, the ASNE is composed of about 700 newspaper editors from all over the country, about 500 of whom (including all the important ones) will be at this meeting. It provides one of the major forums for serious public discussion by interesting people in and out of government, and the proceedings are of course very widely reported.

Sincerely,

Newgold Noyes, Jr.
Program Chairman

Dear Mr. Noyes:

We appreciate your invitation of March 6 to participate in a UFO panel discussion as the annual AAUN meeting. Unfortunately, at this particular time, an Air Force representative take part in such a panel before such a distinguished audience could be of great benefit to us, and we shall be happy to work with you toward this end.

Major Quintanilla, whose job is administering the UFO reports made to the Air Force, and he has limited dealings with the press. Our practices here should be brrunt of dealings with the press and public on this subject, and you might wish to consider having one of our people on the panel in addition to Major Quintanilla.

We look forward to working with your people on this panel and ask that you contact Lt Colonel Jacks of our Public Information Division to work out further details. He, or Capt Enesis in his absence, can be reached on 695-5809 or 695-7793.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a text document, specifically a resume of a telephone conversation between Colonel Stanley and Colonel Holm on April 4, 1967.

The text in the document is as follows:

RESUME OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN:
4 April 1967
COLONEL STANLEY (in Col Jack's office, SAFOD)
COLONEL HOLM

Col Stanley said he had talked to General Giller whose concern simply was that Major Quintanilla would get caught in cross-fire. General Giller had told him that both he and Col Jacks had discussed the problem with Col Holm.

Col Stanley stated that Dave Noyes is President of the Washington Story. He is going to have this panel whether or not the Air Force participates. Participation on a panel of this sort is dangerous for SAFOD. They are aware of the pitfalls, but the SAFOD staff has taken action to reduce the dangers of getting involved.

Col Stanley said Major Quintanilla will be given the same treatment as many others who have gone on a press conference, such as Dr. Brown, for instance. The decision to have him participate was not an accident. Two Colonels with 30 years' experience in the information business will be holding his hands. They will work over every leading dirty question he might get. He will be ready for them. It has got to be best Panel meeting we've had in more than 1-1 1/2 hrs with questions.

Major has two things going for him:
(1) As stated, he will be brainwashed thoroughly before he goes on. We are not going to throw Quintanilla out in the cold pool by himself.
(2) On the 5th of May this panel also, as he is utterly convinced that UFO's are electro-magnetic. He has a book in Random House and is going to be on the panel to promote his book, and will be eager to debate with MacDonald - SAFOD figures Major Quintanilla will probably be able to just sit back and listen to them debate.

Another thing, MacDonald wrote to Dr. Price in AFOAR saying that he will be in Washington on the 17th and has an appointment with Naval Research on the 18th. Price them down. MacDonald will have the argument, "Dr. MacDonald, you had an entire afternoon to present any information you had to AFOAR." Think we have him fireproofed.

Col Stanley says Air Force has had three things this past year in its favor:
1. Contract with Gordon - Want to be able to say that man is free.
2. Movement of Blue Book out of vaulted area.
3. Situation has developed to point where a number of newsmen are taking a real hard-nosed look at the problem.

Col Stanley would like to hear from Col Sleeper ASAP on Friday, 7 April.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I am delighted to hear from General LeBailly that you will be able to appear before the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 21, when we present a panel discussion of the UFO problem.  

First, as to the physical arrangements, the meeting is at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. Saturday, April 22. We will get under way with your panel at 9:30 a.m. or if you have not been assigned by a member of our program committee, we will do so then.

I think it would be wise if you and other panelists were there by 9 a.m. so that we can meet one another, have a cup of coffee, and proceed to the directors' room.

Please let me know whether you want us to arrange accommodations for you at the Shoreham for the night of April 21. We will be glad to do so at our expense, if that is your wish.

I am still working on a possible fourth person for the program. This would be a non-agency citizen who thinks the program has done a remarkably good job in this area.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSISTS OF THE OFFICERS AND THE FOLLOWING:

The text of the document is as follows:

2- Major Quintanilla April 4, 1967

He has seen a saucer, and who (if we can get him) would simply describe the program with a long-minute description of what he thoughts he saw. There is no intention that this "lighting" should become the which discussion of which an example of the sort of thing we are contending with to which the other panelists could later true that they found it useful.

I am trying to line up, for this job, a man named William E. Spovell, a pilot for the Seaboard Republic company, who reported a UFO incident last May 21. Perhaps you may know CAPT. I do not know if details of this case will be made public it will, of course, not appear -- if not, I think we will simply go ahead with the present three speakers.

The main burden of the "debate" on this issue should be borne by the same Quintanilla agrees by our two scientists. As envision the program, we will open with a statement of about ten minutes from several authors of sightings, who are there, and are of extra-terrestrial origin about 20 minutes then by Dr. Menzel, who believes UFOs are those, and are a Holt physical nature. Then Dr. Hyneck, who thinks all UFO sightings can be explained by natural phenomenon such thing. Questions and comments exchange be 10 minutes or so. Then questions and comments exchanged between panelists.

The panelists will be introduced, and the proceedings moderated by a C. McDonald, editor of the Flying Saucers Gazette and Daily News. He is a very amusing and good-natured fellow, and I hope will be able to keep the discussion from becoming too technical and pedantic. This appears to be something of a problem with both Menzel and McDonald!

If you have any problems or questions in regard to all this, please call me. In any event, we'll look forward to seeing you on the 22nd.

Faithfully yours,
[Signature]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a text-based document discussing the history of Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

HISTORY OF PROJECT

Following the Kenneth Arnold sighting on 24 June 1947, wide news coverage of public reports of "flying discs or saucers" created sufficient concern at high military echelons to conduct a preliminary investigation into these reports. Early correspondence indicates that U.S. military leaders were concerned that U.S. aircraft configurations were being reported were an airctaft not previously conceived of by the United States or its allies.

On 30 December 1947, a letter from the Chief of Staff directed AMC to distribute to interested Government Agencies and contractors all information concerning UFO sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which can be of concern to the National Security...

The Technical Intelligence Division of AMC issued a report on 16 December 1948. A report released in February 1949 covering analysis of the first 243 incidents concluded that, while no definite and conclusive evidence existed, evaluation of reports of unidentified objects was a necessity.

After the Project "SIGN" Report, work continued along the same lines and a Project "GRUDGE" Report was published and released in August 1949 by AMC. This report contained analysis of 244 cases and concluded that Unidentified Objects: a) misinterpretation of conventional objects, b) mass hysteria or "War Nerves", c) hoaxes and/or d) psychopathological persons. This work was performed under contract by Ohio State University.

Following publication of the "GRUDGE" Report, the Air Force continued to investigate sightings, inasmuch as it is an Air Force responsibility to identify aerial phenomena. In January 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) possibly was a motive to continue the USAF investigation. 1952 and 1953 centered around Project "Twinkle" and the Green Fireball studies of Dr. LaPaz in the Southwestern United States. Project "Twinkle" Final Report was completed on 27 December 1951. During December 1951 Colonel Richard and Lt. Ruppelt made a visit to a private industrial firm to discuss the feasibility of a scientific study from the data collected since the program's inception.

THE AIR FORCE' BECAME INTERESTED IN THE UFO PHENOMENON AS A PROJECT IN 
1947. DURING THIS PERIOD, A POLICY LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF 
WHICH DIRECTED THE COMMANDER, AIR MATERIAL COMMAND, TO SET UP A PROJECT 
WHOSE PURPOSE WAS TO COLLECT, COLLATE, EVALUATE, AND DISSEMINATE TO INTERESTED 
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND CONTRACTORS ALL INFORMATION REGARDING UFO SIGHTINGS.
INITIALLY THE PROJECT WAS CLASSIFIED, HOWEVER, THIS SECURITY CLASSIFICATION 
WAS DROPPED IN MARCH 1952. THE UFO PROJECT HAS BEEN UNCLASSIFIED SINCE THAT 
TIME.
DURING THE PERIOD 1948 TO 1955, THE AIR FORCE MADE THREE COMPREHENSIVE 
STUDIES OF THE UFO REPORTS WHICH HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THEM. THESE REPORTS 
ARE KNOWN AS THE "SIGN" REPORT WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY OF 1948, THE 
"GRUDGE" REPORT WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN AUGUST OF 1948, AND THE PROJECT 
"BLUE BOOK" REPORT WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN MAY 1955. THE REPORTS CONCLUDED 
THAT "THE PHENOMENA PRESENTED NO THREAT TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF SIGHTINGS WERE MISINTERPRETATIONS OF CONVENTIONAL 
OBJECTS." THEY ALSO CONCLUDED THAT "IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE HIGHLY IMPROBABLE

THAT ANY OF THE UFO REPORTS EXAMINED IN THE STUDIES REPRESENTED TECHNICAL
DEVELOPMENTS OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF PRESENT DAY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. THIS
WAS IN 1955, AND SINCE THAT TIME, PROJECT BLUE BOOK HAS CONCERNED ITSELF
WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE SIGHTINGS, EVALUATION OF THE DATA, AND RELEASE
OF THE INFORMATION TO THE NEWS MEDIA. THIS INFORMATION IS GIVEN TO THE
PUBLIC IN THE FORM OF NEWS RELEASES AND BLUE BOOK BROCHURES.
TODAY, THE OPERATIONAL PORTION OF THE PROJECT IS STILL LOCATED AT
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS STILL
THE SAME TODAY AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING, AND THAT IS TO DETERMINE IF
UFO'S PRESENT A THREAT TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.
I WOULD EMPHASIZE AT THIS POINT THAT, ALTHOUGH WE GO TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO COLLECT ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON A SIGHTING AND TO REACH A CONCLUSION
AS TO WHAT STIMULUS CAUSED THE SIGHTING, SUCH AN EXPLANATION IS WHOLLY
SUBORDINATED TO THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF BLUE BOOK -- THE DETERMINATION IN
EACH CASE WHETHER THERE IS A THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.

MY OFFICE IS THE FOCAL POINT FOR ALL UFO REPORTS WHICH ARE REPORTED
TO THE AIR FORCE. EACH AIR FORCE BASE COMMANDER THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
APPOINTS AN OFFICER TO BE THE UFO INVESTIGATING OFFICER FOR HIS AREA OF
RESPONSIBILITY. THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS COLLECT INFORMATION FROM
OBSERVERS AND CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF THE SIGHTING, ACCORDING
TO THE SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AT THE BASE
LEVEL. THE INFORMATION AND THE PRELIMINARY EVALUATION ARE SUBMITTED TO
THE WRIGHT-PATTERSON OFFICE VIA TELETYPE OR THROUGH LETTER REPORTS. THESE
REPORTS ARE THEN PLACED IN CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO THEIR CHARACTERISTICS.
IF A UFO REPORT EXHIBITS AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS, WE GO DIRECTLY TO THE
FAA, LOCAL AIRPORTS, SAC HQS AND ITS SUBORDINATE UNITS, AND TO THE AIR
DEFENSE COMMAND AND ITS SUBORDINATE UNITS. UFO REPORTS WHICH EXHIBIT BALLOON
CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE CHECKED BY CONTACTING THE U.S. WEATHER STATIONS,
LOCAL AIRPORTS, AIR FORCE WEATHER STATIONS, THE HOLLOMAN BALLOON CONTROL
CENTER, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH, AND VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL
COMPANIES WHICH ARE PRESENTLY ENGAGED IN BALLOON RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.

IN CHECKING REPORTS WHICH EXHIBIT SATELLITE CHARACTERISTICS WE GO
DIRECTLY TO THE SPACE DETECTION CENTER AT COLORADO SPRINGS. THEY HAVE
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRACKING ALL SATELLITE ACTIVITY. WE ALSO GO TO 
THE SPACE DETECTION CENTER FOR INFORMATION REGARDING SATELLITE DECAYS.

FOR REPORTS WHICH WE SUSPECT WERE CAUSED BY MISSILE FIRINGS WE GO
DIRECTLY TO CAPE KENNEDY, VANDENBERG, POINT MUGU, WALLOPS ISLAND, EGLIN, 
GREEN RIVER, AND OTHER MILITARY UNITS WHICH MIGHT BE ENGAGED IN SPECIAL
ACTIVITIES.

FOR ANALYSIS OF RADAR REPORTS WE USE AN ORGANIZATION AT WRIGHT-
PATTERSON OR CAN USE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE ENGAGED IN THIS TYPE
OF ACTIVITY.

FOR PHOTO ANALYSIS WE USE ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON.

FOR PHYSICAL SPECIMENS WHICH ARE SUBMITTED TO THE PROJECT OFFICE, WE
HAVE USED THE SERVICES OF THE AIR FORCE MATERIEL LABORATORY, BATTELE
MEMORIAL, PURE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, LIBBY OWENS AND CORNING GLASS,
THE NORTHWESTERN GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT, AND THE INSTITUTE OF PAPER CHEMISTRY.

OLIVIER, HEAD OF THE AMERICAN METEOR SOCIETY, AND DR. ROBINSON, AN ASTRONOMER
FROM WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB. WE ALSO, FREQUENTLY REFER TO OPEN LITERATURE
SUCH AS SKY & TELESCOPE FOR CURRENT INFORMATION ON COMETS, METEORS, AND
AURORAL DISPLAYS.
ALTHOUGH MY OFFICE STAFF IS SMALL, WITHIN THE WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB
COMPLEX, I HAVE THE SERVICES OF PHYSICISTS, CHEMISTS, ASTRONOMERS, METEOR-
OLOGISTS, AERODYNAMIC ENGINEERS, AND PHOTO ANALYSTS. THESE PEOPLE ARE
AVAILABLE TO THE PROJECT WHENEVER THEY ARE NEEDED.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD, THAT I HAVE RECEIVED EXCELLENT ORGANIZATIONAL
AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FROM ALL ECHELONS IN THE AIR STAFF. THE SECRETARY
OF THE AIR FORCE AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF ARE INTERESTED IN THIS PROGRAM.
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE AIR FORCE MUST EVALUATE SUBJECTIVE
INFORMATION WHICH CANNOT BE DUPLICATED IN A LABORATORY. WE ARE EVALUATING
AN OBSERVER'S INTERPRETATION OF AN EXPERIENCE OR EVENT. WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF METEORITES, WE HAVE NEVER RECOVERED ANYTHING TANGIBLE OF EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL
ORIGIN.

I AM SURE THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE AIR FORCE CONTRACT SIGNED LAST YEAR WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO. THIS CONTRACT, VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $300,000, IS BETWEEN THE AIR FORCE OFFICE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE UNIVERSITY. 

IT CALLS FOR AN 18-MONTH STUDY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DR. EDWARD U. CONDON, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS AND NOW A PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO.

I WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT VERY CLEAR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT. THE ONLY INVOLVEMENT OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK WITH THE COLORADO CONTRACT IS TO PROVIDE THEM DUPLICATES OF ALL CURRENT UFO REPORTS AND SUCH MATERIAL FROM OUR FILES AS THEY MAY ASK FOR. AS A MATTER OF INTEREST, TO DATE I HAVE SUPPLIED THEM WITH AT LEAST 400 CASE HISTORIES.

DR. CONDON IS CONDUCTING A TOTALLY INDEPENDENT STUDY.

IN CONCLUSION I WANT TO READ TWO PARAGRAPHS FROM THE CURRENT PROJECT BLUE BOOK REPORT:

"TO DATE, THE FIRM CONCLUSIONS OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK ARE: (1) NO UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTED, INVESTIGATED, AND EVALUATED BY THE AIR FORCE HAS EVER GIVEN ANY INDICATION OF THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY;"

- page 25 -

The image does not contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

GIVEN ANY INDICATION OF THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY; (2) THERE HAS BEEN
NO EVIDENCE SUBMITTED TO OR DISCOVERED BY THE AIR FORCE THAT SIGHTINGS
CATEGORIZED AS UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OR PRINCIPLES
BEYOND THE RANGE OF PRESENT DAY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE; AND (3) THERE HAS BEEN
NO EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT SIGHTINGS CATEGORIZED AS UNIDENTIFIED ARE
EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLES.
"THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE ALL REPORTS OF UNUSUAL
AERIAL PHENOMENA OVER THE UNITED STATES. THE SERVICES OF QUALIFIED SCIENTISTS
AND TECHNICIANS WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED TO INVESTIGATE AND ANALYZE THESE
REPORTS, AND PERIODIC REPORTS ON THE SUBJECT WILL BE MADE.
"THE AIR FORCE TAKES NO STAND ON WHETHER OR NOT EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE
COULD OR DOES EXIST. SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT
THE UNIVERSE CONTAINS LIFE ON PLANETS OTHER THAN OUR OWN. THE AIR FORCE
CONTINUES TO EXTEND AN OPEN INVITATION TO ANYONE WHO FEELS THAT HE POSSESSES
ANY EVIDENCE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLES OPERATING WITHIN THE EARTH'S NEAR
SPACE ENVELOPE TO SUBMIT HIS EVIDENCE FOR ANALYSIS."
