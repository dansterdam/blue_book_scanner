Commanding General
Little Rock Air Force Base
Little Rock, Arkansas

Dear Sir:

I do not know to whom I should write this letter but the air base seemed the best place. This morning around four o'clock my mother saw what at first glance looked like a star, but when we looked closer we could tell that it was not. It was much brighter and larger than a star and was giving off rays. It stayed stationary in the east from our house until around five we noticed it had moved farther east and a little south. 

This is the third time we have seen such an object in the early hours of morning although I don't remember the other giving off rays or light as brightly as this one.

------ during the Christmas Holidays of 1955.
---------The are also very interested in the rays of light given off by this object because at one time this morning we were standing outside under a tree watching it when some rays come directly at us, although we didn’t realize this until the area around the tree limbs above our heads lit up for about a second or two, therefore engulfing us also.
--------- If you can tell us anything about this object we would appreciate it very much.
--------- Sincerely yours,

[redacted]

Adona, Arkansas
