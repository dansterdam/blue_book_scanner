The image does not contain any visible photographs. The text appears to be a document from the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was an effort to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s. The text discusses a UFO sighting in Sweden in December 1958 and the Air Force's investigation of the incident.

SUBJECT: (deleted) UFO's in Sweden

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. (deleted) During the month of December 1958, there was considerable publicity in the Swedish press concerning UFO sightings. On 9 December 1959, the Air Attache in Stockholm requested USAFE for clarification of the information, and the Air Force Intelligence Officers in Wiesbaden were asked to investigate. The Air Attache representative joined the Swedish group in classifying the sightings into categories. There was no intelligence information of real significance submitted by this director, however, as it was considered that the reports lacked substantiating data.

2. (deleted) The Air representative was shown secret Swedish Air Force intelligence which indicated that many of the reported UFO sightings are Soviet attempts to test Swedish radar and other defensive installations.

It has been able to establish that the Swedish Air Force Intelligence has been closely watching developments and have determined that one wave of these "UFO" sightings, or a phenomenon observed over the Swedish island of Gotland, would have been a piston and jet driven aircraft flown by Soviets from the Baltic area and over the island. Some "halos" were found and analyzed chemically, and it is believed to be the residue of exhaust from such an aircraft.

It is believed that the Swedish Air Force Intelligence "experts" pointed out that this is the Swedish air defense practice of routing Soviet aircraft over Sweden, and the "unknown" phenomena are not unknown at all, but rather a Soviet attempt to probe Swedish air defenses.

3. (deleted) requested the ATI representative to ascertain through ATIC whether there are any similar reports from other Scandinavian countries, and whether any international investigation of this phenomenon, such as high altitude A- or H-bursts, high altitude rocket experiments, etc., is planned.

There is excellent cooperation between U.S. and Swedish Air Force intelligence on several problems of interest. It is suggested that any information which can throw light on this matter should be included in a briefing to be included in a briefing to the Swedish Air Force Intelligence.
Because of the excellent security cooperation between two governments, this correspondence may be excluded from briefing to Swedish Air Force Intelligence.

UNCLASSIFIED
AFGHN-USAF-22-0900 UFOB IN SWEDEN
OP-20-16-FOO 
08/1§/1958 A-39

SUBJECT: UFOBS IN SWEDEN

1. UNITED STATES AIR FORCE was informed on 12 May 1958 of a UFO sited by reliable witnesses in Europe. The witnesses were residents of Halsingberg, Sweden. The object was observed on 7 December 1957.

2. The only data available to the USAF is that contained in a Swedish language report forwarded to USAF Headquarters. This report describes the object as oval, silvery, and giving off a reddish-orange glow. The object was stated to be large, about 10 meters in diameter, and appeared to be at a relatively high altitude.

3. The witnesses alleged that this was a residue or substance of some sort dropped from the object. This material was examined by competent authorities in Sweden and proved to be a fine, fibrous, gossamer-like substance, similar to spider web. Several hundred examples of this material were forwarded to the USAF with the report of the sighting.

4. In contact with the Air Force's scientific engineering center, analysis of this material indicates it may be of a relatively high dielectric nature. The material appears to be a poorly conducting electrical insulator, containing metallic particles irregularly distributed within the material. It is suggested that the area of the Swedish sighting be carefully examined for any residual radiation.

5. It is suggested that the area of the Swedish sighting be carefully examined before rainfall or snowfall occurs. The sighting itself was observed shortly before noon, and any additional reports or observations should be given consideration.

6. Sighting phenomena of a canary-green glow as reported may require more intensive investigation of unusual atmospheric conditions in the area at the time of the sighting. 

7. Ground or low-level search by trained observers may prove rewarding to obtain additional details concerning size, altitude, direction of flight, etc.

8. A freak wind blowing in an entirely uncommon direction at the time of the sighting may be significant.
