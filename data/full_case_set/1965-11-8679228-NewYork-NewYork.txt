The text on the page reads:

This is an AF command post, we were in the front yard when we saw this thing. The air movement officer came out to see it, it hovered a long time, then it took off south rapidly and then disappeared from sight.

One 189-1930 with the New Yorker office building. This is the second sighting I have made in two weeks where bright object appeared to be moving slowly at uniform speed and then suddenly take off rapidly disappearing in the distance.

This report was originally given to Capt Harrison from the D D R who relayed it to the former N.Y. file. I did not see the object myself but this is the account of the two persons who reported it.

The handwritten text describes the observation of a strange object in the sky, including details about its movement and behavior. There is no photograph present in the image.

DID UFO'S CAUSE THE GREAT NORTHEASTERN POWER FAILURE? 
by John J. Robinson -

November 9th, 1965, was a day long to be remembered by some thirty million people in the northeastern United States, where one-sixth of our total population is concentrated. This region, which the most densely populated in the world, the trouble even included a portion of eastern Canada, and caused havoc for a great many of good neighbors.
The power failure was at the height of the evening rush hour, caught many New Yorkers and others suspended in mid-air. twenty-five floats glided from the city streets, Broadway, trapped underground, in the tunnels of New York's subways, stranded thousand of people waiting for trains, it later created more problems as cars broke down, out of gas - which could not be repaired. The bridges and tunnels leading from the city became looded with cars that could not move, while on the city streets jammed with frantic humanity.
Our editors, James Wanset, had the ward experience for Fort Lee, New Jersey, when blackout came. He had the onroad experience of watching the Philadelphia channels started coming in clearly for the first time in history. After midnight, the terrible desolation began. There was little to nothing. Thousands of people were stranded, and every available building lobby, in a scene reminiscent of the world war II bombings.
The UN building, the UN students, had never been so light-beating, group of them playing basketball, supplied by a listener in New Jersey - most of which was unaffected by the blackout. The imperial induce trancision system was bombarded by twenty-fourth floor by groups of engineers, via telephones, trying to cause their way up the steps with matches! 
What has happened to cause all this confusion? The science-fiction stories had turned off the power for an area which included most or all of eight states. One of the demands, and the plants supplying the region's electricity simply went out of commission - All power grids in this area bounded together, which is called a "power grid". It consists of 42 electrical utility companies in Pennsylvania, the power failure caused by a high demand for electricity, when twenty-three, companies involved, and most of Maine was able to do the same thing. Twenty-seven communities, however, were disaster. The overload on their generators created not only a power drain but also on distribution breakdown which could not keep up with the terrific demands, however, and these will have to have their huge armature rewound before they can operate again.
What caused the trouble? So one seems to know. The New York Daily News of November 11th stated: "There is no mechanical failure." The New York Times reported any damage, the equipment found which would indicate mechanical failure.

several people who claim to have seen a fireball over Manhattan during the November 19th issue of Time Magazine, taken from stockus and a full description given. The New York Journal-American carried the identical report. Shows what appears to be a bell-shaped UFO hovering over Manhattan! (See page xx.) On November 13th, the New York Journal-American carried a story about a "huge fiery object" which was observed through the night moving across the sky between New York and Pittsfield, Mass. Gary begins by quoting one E. Lesley G. Lozinger, "International Director of the department-afflated saucer phenomena, Organization in Tucson, Arizona" further on, this is referred to as a "private group co-operating with the government". The sighting appeared to be less garbled, however, than most U.F.O. reports.

The mass of the article is less garbled, however, and is confirmed by other observations. A similar object was seen in Oriskany Field near Syracuse, N.Y. was attempting a landing tat that field, when they abandoned a flight in the sky, it first Ross thought it was a building on fire, but then it proved was over 100 feet long in diameter. The entire incident was personally diminished in size according to Mr. Ross, and there were no longer any landing lights on the field. He was informed by the central tower that they did hear the flights but he was not given much information.

Mr. Ross calculated that the fireball appeared at a point where the New York Power Authority's two 345 kilovolt lines were coming from Niagara Falls to lower New York State.

At 10:20 PM the Clay Substation in Yonkers which is a normal load dispatch center went dark. This, they claim, was entirely automated. The disaster throughway Company that planted disaster tree line failed to uncover any trouble along them.

Jeanne Dixon, the famous seer, reminded the public that she predicted two years ago that New Yorkers would have the "blackout" and that she believes the incident is by to be construed that the Russians were going to cause a blackout.

The dispatch that Mr. Ross a blackout puzzle piggies up. The American and Russian Diplomats were out with a far-out rumor to the effect that the blackout was caused by the hacking of a computer-controlled Russian electrical missile system. There is no evidence that this is true. The point at which the fireball was sighted coincides with many places where the electrical lines were damaged, destroying any enemy missile within range.
 The question of the embers which would have accompanied this fireball is significant. Some newsmen have suggested that the embers were caused by the burning out of a power transformer, but this seems more like an effort to give an accidental explanation to a phenomenon which may have sinister implications.
was even built. The Defense Department had looked into the case, but I am told that it was totally insignificant. from the military point of view, totally insignificant to me.

sent - flashing lights in the sky, mysteriously appearing and disappearin. The first report came in shortly after 8 p.m. From Nick DeCara. who was flasblng a light like someone waving in the sky. As it passed overhead, the light seemed dimmer, and suddenly it went out. Moments later, it came on again at the same place. 
Shortly afterward, their son came home and said he had seen a strange light in the sky at 3:15 p.m. Shortly afterwards, their son came home and said he had seen a strange light in the sky at 3:15 p.m.
Then, shortly after 9 p.m., Pichael Rodriguez was driving westward on Warner Roads Highway 378. He said he saw a blue light approach rapidly and pass over his car. At about the same time, a man named Russell Horff, who was turning off Highway 378 onto Batley Road, saw flashes in the sky. Four such flashes, about 20 to 30 seconds apart. He noticed that the flashes seemed to be emanating out of some point in the sky. 
this caused several phone calls to police from people living in the town town area, along with these callers said they had seen lights in the sky of various forms, many flashing on and off, but definitely ruled out lightning.
Thus, there seems to be little doubt that the electromagnetic effects of UFOs come in many varieties and intensities. Although these are at least two formal investigations now going on, according to the Navfume 130 blackout, it will not be revealed to the public. UFO researchers, like the rest of the public, can only wait and see what strange events these aerial machines have in store for us in the future!

The image contains a photograph showing what appears to be a UFO over a vehicle. The text below the image states that the photograph is from Time Magazine, showing a UFO over a munition factory that had a power failure.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

"same type of power-draining effect that our scientists did not bother to develop. In any case, most researchers in the UFO field are well aware of the fact that the so-called "flying saucers" have a tendency to hover over power houses and to interfere with the manufacture of atomic materials, electric communi- cations, such as television, radio, telephone, and other types of electromagnetic effects which can be subjectively labelled as electromagnetic effects which can be subjectively labelled as electrical spollations such as electrical appliances and automobiles have on several occasions been subjected to a strange force from the UFOs which caused the liquid in their batteries to solidify and die, headlights, and induction coil.

Finally, there is a fantastic story in November 27th St. Paul, Minnesota daily Press, revealing evidence of multiple failures in the area the previous night, according to the ingredients of a scientific thrilling
