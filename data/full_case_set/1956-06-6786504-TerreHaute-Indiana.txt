The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073 with details about a sighting that occurred on 22 June 1956 in Terre Haute, Indiana. The text on the record card is as follows:

1. DATE: 22 June 1956

6. SIZE: Approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Three (3) minutes
8. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
9. COURSE: One
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The object was sighted at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet, moving in a general course. It was a lighted object, approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter, and was observed for about three minutes, heading in a general course of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet.
11. COMMENTS: Note that the object had to be below the altitude of 1,000 feet, the height of the overcast. It was a cloudy day so it is the opinion of the observer that this sighting was caused by a weather balloon released at Terre Haute, Indiana. Note that the winds below 6,000 feet were from the SW and that the object was moving in that direction.
