FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 66

From the Journal of Copenhagen: "On November 8, while flying over Jarrow, a peculiar flying object was seen by several people in the area, which made a roaring noise and terrified the locals, according to reports."

There follows a description of the sighting, including details that the object "was not an airplane" and that "no civil aircraft were in the area at the time."

The text then discusses another sighting from Inverness Road, Jarrow, where an object described as "The Thing" was seen on several occasions, with witnesses reporting the object was "about 30 feet in diameter."

The document then shifts to a discussion of a Sandown sighting in England on 3 Nov 65, describing an incident where a couple saw an unidentified object hovering above them while walking.

Jarrow deltavolants? 
From The Journal of Copenhagen: November 8 edition, we learn how "On November 8, while flying over Jarrow, a peculiar flying object was seen by several people in the area, which made a roaring noise and terrified the locals, according to reports."

The thing was not a plane, because some of my friends saw it over Jarrow. A few minutes later it disappeared.
"The wire not aeroplane, because
of one of my friends told that no civil aircraft were in the area at the time."

Inverness Road, Jarrow, reported more strange objects like a flashlight "The Thing", was seen on sight occasions. Mother complained because it frightened her children.
"About thirty feet wide was of a pnosphorus nature and lit up the nearby bushes, occasionally it shot off at a terrific pace upwards and disappeared." The owner of The Jarrow Trades Hall mentioned it several times.

Sandown sighting
The S. of p. H. Cooper, of Sandown, I.O.W. gave the following account: "An addition to the recent reports of sightings, unidentified objects in the sky. On November 3, at 5.45 p.m., my wife and I were walking down the cliff from the direction of Seaview, when they saw an object, which had a silver centre surrounded by a halo of light. It was traveling at a fantastic speed towards the sea, making no perceptible noise. After reaching the sea, it made a 90 degree turn and shot upwards at a terrific pace upwards and disappeared. The object appeared to be of a phosphorous nature and was quite bright, so much so that we could not have been a firework or anything normal."

CHANNEL ISLANDS 
"That sighted again?" 
The following reader's letter appeared in The Evening Star, Jersey, Channel Islands, of November 21: "Dear Sir, although I was a visitor on a strange sight that occurred between 8.20 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on Thursday evening, Nov. 11, I am not altogether convinced that I observed any phenomenon that I could not easily explain away. The object was definitely seen at a great height passing across the sky at a high speed, but was flying quite low so that it could clearly be seen. It had a definite shape, but vanished in a few seconds, but I was unable to give a good definition. It made no sound as far as I could judge, and it was not trailing any smoke or vapor, yet I would like to enquire whether other observers had seen a similar object, as the sky was cloudy. I would like to enquire whether anyone else has observed the same object, and whether it has been seen before.
Yours truly, John Woodcock, Hague Cottages, St. Ouen."

Cylindrical Object 
near Leicester 
The Leicaster Mercury of November 5 carried a story of a mysterious object seen near Leicester, England, on the evening of November 4 about 7.30 p.m. 
Mr. Geoffrey Fenlon, 15 The Drive, Wigston, 0.S.D. said the object between 400 and 500 feet above ground was observed by himself and his wife. It was cylindrical in shape, silvery-grey in colour, spinning rapidly and giving off a pulsating red light. Mr. Fenlon stated that the object appeared to be under control and manoeuvered in the sky. It was moving in a northerly direction across the sky and appeared to be the size of a large house. Several other people, including a lorry-driver and his passenger, the manager of a Hinckley company and his wife, were also watching the object move across the sky. Mr. Fenlon said the object was definitely not a firework. "It is hard to be objective in these circumstances, I can only try to describe what I saw and leave it to others to judge," he concluded.

The Great American and Mexican Blackouts
By Gordon Creighton

AT approximately 5.18 p.m. on November 9, an area of 80,000 square miles extending from Boston to Buffalo and up into the Canadian Provinces, was blacked out. Other major cities affected included Rochester, Syracuse, Buffalo, and Toronto. In some areas the blackout, which in some areas lasted for as much as 13 hours, upper New York State and in the heart of the populous Northeast region. According to reports, the scientists present included Dr. William Beattie, a research director at Walter Reed Army Hospital and consultant to the U.S. National Aeronautical Federation and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Dr. James Shiner, Assistant to the director of Bio-Technology and Human Research at the U.S.A.F. Walter Reed Army Hospital, and myself, Jeane Dixon was more knowledgeable than anyone else in the room.

The U.S. Air Force has pointed out that the Northeast's huge CAUSE of the trouble came exactly five years after the biggest blackout in history occurred on November 9, 1965, when 30 million people were blacked out in the most heavily populated, most power-dependent region. In the blackout several central eastern power grids, affecting millions of people, had suddenly shuddered. At the Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, on the shore of Lake Ontario, the area was blacked out within minutes. The power failure affected areas of New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Canada, marking Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant - biggest in the hemisphere - as the center of disturbance. The blackout origin, the scientists present there, indicated clearly on graphs and reports, was a power surge that had started at Niagara and was unquestionably manmade. There were more "quickly lines" than an earthquake had ever showed.

An American generosity pun amicable: At Consolidated Edison's Waring Center on West 16 Manhattan, this meter recorded 320,000 kilowatts. At 5.18 the flux soared, and within minutes 30 million people were blacked out.

The U.S. Air Force offered an explanation (the London Evening Standard had carried a report about the same time from New York) that scientists were convinced the big blackout of November 11, 1965 concluded that the breakdown was "due to the phemonenon" known as "power surge" or "overload". The scientists present included Dr. William Beattie, a research director at Walter Reed Army Hospital and consultant to the U.S. National Aeronautical Federation and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Dr. James Shiner, Assistant to the director of Bio-Technology and Human Research at the U.S.A.F. Walter Reed Army Hospital, and myself, Jeane Dixon was more knowledgeable than anyone else in the room.

To conclude, I refer readers to the vitally important material published in the Flying Saucer Review of September-October 1965 concerning the earlier power failures.

"The pilot, Weldon Kobs, a flying instructor, says that, on the evening of Tuesday November 2nd, when he was in the vicinity of Syracuse airport, aboard a small aircraft, he saw a silvery object hovering above the field, seen through the window of his plane. As he was returning to Niagara Falls, when we say the object drop down the horizon slightly, and disappear. The pilots said the incident occurred precisely at 7:30 p.m. Immediately after the lights went out."
"2. -- If you look at certain pictures of so-called "flying saucers", you will see that quite obviously the power that drives them, so-called "propeller", is a human characteristic. You must be relieved to know it wasn't."
"4. Many readers will know that the American National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, NICAP, has been investigating and tested by psychiatrists and students of parapsychology, and is called by some of their findings quite spectacular and contrary to some findings at the same time."
"...record that Mrs. Dixon has been interviewd by very qualified Defense officials from the Pentagon, yet the sources of the highly secret and classified military and political information that she has given these officials still remains unknown to them."
"To conclude, I refer readers to the vitally know more about future developments in the Space Race. Mrs. Dixon agreed to indicate on rockets that might, and let them know what she saw. After that, she refused to talk, and has had one of her visits discontinued after her security clearance was cancelled - the whole bedroom. She says "I have a silver ball, like the picture." We visited the site of the alleged UFO landing, a day after the first, arriving to find the field intact and undisturbed."

EVALUATION OF UFO REPORT INVESTIGATION

Date: 29 November 1965
From: J. O'Neill
To: R. H. Fowler
Investigation Date: 24 November 1965
Observation Date: 13 November 1965
Observers: Miss Linda Williams, 555 Broadway, Raynham, Massachusetts
Miss Laurie Guest, 69 Jackson Drive, Raynham, Massachusetts

Place of Observation: Norton Massachusetts (Girl Scout Camp)

A. General Review
This investigator interviewed the principals on the evening of 24 November 1965 from approximately 7:30 p.m. to approximately 8:30 p.m., in the presence of the father of Miss Guest, Mr. Gordon Guest.

Prior to my interview, both girls were in possession of NICAP report forms (short form) and had partially completed them.

In questioning, I was impressed to individually question the girls, and in view of their prior work on the report forms, I deemed it meaningless to do so.

Questioning revealed that at least one of the girls (Miss Guest) heard one or more of the significant radio-type sounds described in prior press reports in the Boston Herald pertaining to the Hill case.

During the questioning and subsequent discussion, various discrepancies appeared in the answers from each girl, and there was an inability to get a mutually satisfactory answer which would formulate a clear answer to which was usually seconded by the other.

The most important variances in verbal answers with written answers are as follows:

1. Distance: (Written reports not completed) Neither girl had the slightest conception of distance. Answers over the questioning period ranged from "a few hundred feet" to "eight to ten miles".

2. Size: (Written reports not completed) Both girls agreed that the object was the "size of a helicopter", "about the size of a halfmoon", yet neither could approximate a more reasonable comparison.

- page 15 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

3. Motion: One girl couldn't describe motion while one (Miss Williams, see report) decided the object moved toward the moon and disappeared.
4. Observation: Neither girl could say either when they became aware of noise, or why the noise was identified as emanating from the object. Verbal reports varied between a jet at great height and a fly caught in a window.
5. Description: The girls stated the object appeared to be one bright light and the moon was above it and to the right of the object. One girl froze the moon above and to the right of the object. (See report)
B. Related Information
1. The father of Miss Guest informed me that although a confirmed non-believer of himself, he was sure that his daughter had seen something, and was definitely "slightly upset" by the experience.
2. As the experience tended to elimiate supernatural bodies, I have taken the only probable "phenomenon", and reduced its position relative to the moon and planets to the position at the time and date of the observation. I used Boston as an approximate locale, since I know the latitude and longitude, and the variance between Boston and Raynham is minor.
Azimuth Apparent Position: 11/13/65 11:30 P.M.
Moon Ascension 6 hr. 43 min.
Declination 0° 29' 03" min.
Jupiter Ascension 6 hr. 02 min.
Declination -8° 19' 
Reduction to local meridian places the moon approximately 45° above the Eastern horizon, and Jupiter approximately to the right and slightly above the moon.
Conclusion: Allowing for the variances noted above regarding size, position, motion, etc. and taking the father's statement into consideration, I have concluded that the girls did in fact see an unknown object, and that it was probably the planet Jupiter.
A combination of the lateness of the hour, the remote and unfamiliar location, lack of knowledge of astronomical phenomena coupled with the recent exposure and contents of the Hill case could trigger the imagination to this extent.

CLOSE SIGHTING IN PENNSYLVANIA: On the evening of November 27th, two men-resdients of Confluence, Pennsylvania, saw a luminous cigar-shaped craft pass over the city. It seemed to be about ten feet in diameter, and no higher than 2 thousand feet. It more ascending and descending, and its movement was very erratic. It came to a complete stop at one point, and then disappeared "in no time at all," according to the report. (Saucer News, 11/29/65)

ARGENTINE PLANE NEARLY CRASHES WITH A UFO: Still another case of UFOs endangering the exclusively-identified flights of American airlines occurred on the 24th of November, when an Argentine airliner, carrying passengers, was bound for a landing at Resistencia, an route from Rio de Janeiro, at about 9:30 P.M. local time. While descending for landing, the crew of the airliner suddenly observed a brilliant, fast-moving object headed directly toward them. The pilot made a "rapid maneuver" to change course while the mysterious object passed them. The passengers also observed the same UFO, and it was observed visually by personnel at the airport's control tower.

MORE DATA ON ADDITIONAL U.F.O. REPORT

A path of lights were seen in November 29, 1965, at 2:00 A.M. 
It consisted of mother, and a daughter-in-law observed 15 to 20 objects of 50 power. 
Were red lights at appear, sometimes went out dark, then appeared again. Were observed in a same direction, went 5-10 minutes, seemed to disappear in telescope. Appeared as disk in telescope. Approximately, altitude, 50,000 to 60,000 feet. Lights were white, strobe type. 
Were controlled. At times stopped, and spread out over sky, then got back formation, and began moving north again. Sighting lasted about 15 minutes.
Dry condition of weather was good. Cool, about 50 degrees.Scattered clouds. 
Drawing below will show formation.

These objects were craft. Were seen thru telescope. Did flying stunts. Observer did not detect any sound. My video will take a life detector test anytime. If you wish more information, let me know. 
Saw same thing week later, but only 13 objects. Have not seen it since. 
Drawing below will show formation.

ROCKET EXPERIMENT TIMED
WITH TWO SATELLITE PASSES AT WALLOPS
A rocket experiment coordinated with overpasses of two satellites was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Wallops Island, Va., at 3:02 p.m. EDT today.
An ionosphere experiment prepared jointly by the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies, Dallas, Texas, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., was launched on a 4-stage Javelin rockets. The launch was coordinated with overpasses of the Canadian satellites, Alouette II, and the U. S. satellites.
Explorer XXXI, launched "piggyback" into polar orbit by a Thor-Agena B from the Western Test Range in California November 29, 1963. The Javelin probe was sent up between the two satellite passes.
Primary objective of the flight was to measure properties of the ionosphere--ion composition, concentration and temperature and electron concentration and temperature--and to correlate the --more--

results with simultaneous measurements made by the two satellites. The ionosphere is a region of charged particles in the upper atmosphere.

The launch vehicle was a 48-foot Javelin (ARGO D-4) sounding rocket. The 120-pound payload was boosted to a peak altitude of 493 statute miles. Data were telemetered to ground stations during the flight. No recovery operation was involved.

Project Scientist is Thomas W. Flowerday of the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies. R. G. Plihal was the Goddard Vehicle Manager. William L. Lord was Project Engineer for Wallops Station, with Paul A. White serving as Launch Pad Supervisor.

Dear Sir:

This is my name I believe that all of my sightings or messages are bona fide. I realize that the anti-seeing your child-ren. I find paranoid people always trying to analyze what I saw and war [CENSORED]. I am an 18 years old can have seen strange objects on 3 August 1965 at 8:55 pm in my field. It was bright and oval and at 9:30 p.m. it was looking in the sky with my 3.5 [CENSORED] and my 1.5 [CENSORED] telescope, my neighbor, not anything such as a aircraft spotlightcontrol, teleteam, not anything was a sizable ball of light, and then two lights, they were very close together and some speed, they were very low altitude, may be 30 to 35 feet in diameter. We saw them for 10 to 15 minutes and we could not analyze them anymore. They were so bright and maneuverable far beyond our present capabilities.

Transcribing the text:

"Sighted for about 15 seconds, they stated moving at 150 miles per hour zig-zagging all over the sky. The object was large, appeared to be elliptical (sic) in shape, and emission of light (s or other) were observed distinctly. No sound was heard, but it was probably to high to be audible. The object was seen disappearing in a east (sic) to west direction.

If you have an option, a confirmation of this report is someoneexamine, would appreciate it.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]

P.S. This is a description of what is said to be a observation of 1963-8-5 or 6."
