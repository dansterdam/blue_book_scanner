with 72% indications thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation.
This estimate is based only on the assumption that the evidence is
valid and merits true and accurate evaluation, visual and physical. To
look at explanations as "Mass Hysteria," when psychological phenomena
are explained traditionally, as expounded by Mr. Donald Menzel in
review of Air Material Command /-Ac1-vi.14 'A5. Laboratory (Code Ag-
I- s4-b).

The --).t evaLLations psychological explanations for the
unidentified flying objects to provier plausible explanations
reports not otherwise explainable. Reports in Zdentifying an
usually result chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, and
size.

All oi this remaining 31 indications are treated in detail in set-
-reports. These indicators point o- pla:Lurn in regard to true or esti-
type of object, or manner of performance. There are indications, how-
over, that some sightings were 'eal.'oor by actual machines, but
probably would not have been considered, unsual or reported,
from no special study.

VII. Sw,,,,ary of ATIC Evaluatinn on "o-ticular Reports

The remaining unexplained incQ.dents (see Appendix "I") exhib-
it certain characteristics. Two of their substantions of their charac-
vId not have been made had no witnesses not made of the pat-
tern.

(incident Xcti-bon 10. 17). .The above selected without selection
throughout the United States. A few were outside of the U. S. No two
descriptions or appearance or Performance were exactly alike. The re-
ported sightings occurred at various times of day and year.

In the following section of this report, each remaining unnamed
incident is evaluated separately. It is thus meant to generally give a
character or observations, which would tend to emphasize what goes
into the exercise. The numerical designation represents an approximate
25% of the incidents in the period ending.

Incident No. 76 -- 13 August 1947, Salmon Dam, Idaho.

Two men reported simultaneously hearing a roar, and looking up observed
two objects of undetermined size, several miles distant at a great
height which they thought might have been 4000-6000 feet. The objects
were "circular," "reflected lights," and were traveling at "great speed."
Although occurring on the same day as Incident No. 75, the descriptions
vary widely.

ATIC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to
refute the assumption that these men saw two ordinary aircraft at too
great a distance to discern details.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #76 -- Salmon Dam, Idaho -- 13 August 1947

There does not appear to be anything astronomical about this incident.

Although sighted on the same day as the sky-blue canyon saucer (incident #75), the objects described here seem to have little or no similarity to the former.

The image in the document appears to be a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch seems to illustrate a landscape with something in the sky, which might be an interpretation of the objects mentioned in the text. It is a simple line drawing, with the upper part of the image having some scribbled lines, likely representing the trajectory or motion of the UFOs described. The lower part of the image shows a curved line with several circles or dots on it, which might represent the horizon and possibly trees or other landmarks.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Agent could not locate ******************** but ***************** who
accompanied ********* at the time stated that he and ********* could hear a
roar. They looked up and saw 2 objects flying at great height which
might have been between 1,000 and 10,000 ft. He could give no estimate as to
size and said they could have been several miles away. He and ***********
were satisfied that had seen something and were very doubtful if the objects
were planes.

From a newspaper account (Times News, Twin Falls, Idaho, Friday Aug 15, 1947)
**************** said he had seen an unusual object in the air on
the same day as *********'s experience (Incident 75) and that a sound resembling
the echo of a motor caused him to look upward and there he saw two circular
objects which reflected light. They were traveling at a great speed and at
higher altitude than most planes.
