Text from the document:

UFO Sighting, Rolla, Missouri
Hq USAF FEYDOIC (Mrs Hunt)
Reference the attached letter from Mr. requesting information on the sighting. The following is a suggested reply:

We have checked the satellite schedule on the date and time of 6 October 1965 and find that only Pageos I was in the area, however, this satellite is in a very high orbit and its magnitude is low. Therefore, it is quite likely that one or more of these other satellites were observable. 

All known satellites have orbital flights with an easterly component, whether Northeast or Southeast, and have visual characteristics distinctly different from the objects described in the sighting. Also, there is no evidence that the sighting objects fit the pattern of any known satellites or space probes.

NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA  
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR  
1536 CONNECTICUT AVENUE, N.W.  
WASHINGTON 6, D.C.

October 8, 1965

Honorable Lyndon B. Johnson
The White House
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. President:

I am writing to express the grave concern of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena over the continued secrecy and deception surrounding the subject of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

For the past eighteen years, the United States Air Force has conducted Project Blue Book, a study of UFO reports. This project has been a sham, failing to reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon. Project Blue Book has consistently denied, debunked, and hidden the facts about UFOs.

Overwhelming evidence, much of it classified, points to the fact that UFOs are real, that they are of extraterrestrial origin, and that their presence on our planet poses a serious threat to our national security. Despite this, the Air Force has refused to fully inform the Congress, the President, and the public about the true nature of the UFO problem.

The time has come for the government to act responsibly and to end the official campaign of secrecy and deception. The American people have a right to know the facts about UFOs. We urge you, as President, to take immediate action to open up the truth about UFOs.

Sincerely,  
[Signature]
Major Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.)
Director

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a typed text document. As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

1. The objects we see too big to be planes, blink or flicker.
2. They do not give off any noise or exhaust like a jet plane.
3. Could look like an object hovering or maneuvering. These were reported several times at different dates and locations.
4. I really think it is something quite unexplainable. The light trail by my husband's car has me quite puzzles. Could you give me any more plausible explanation? Thank you.
Sincerely,
