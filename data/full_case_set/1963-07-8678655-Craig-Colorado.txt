On July 8, 1963 Craig, Colorado - Officers Vald ow and It were on our way to 137 home after we returned to the office. At 3:34 we saw an object apparently hovering over the southeast hill, it appeared to be luminous and moving significantly, at a northeast direction - a few minutes later at 3:48 am it was perfectly still and oval shaped, seemed to be about 40 feet long with lights all around it, we watched it for about 20 minutes, then it suddenly accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared, there were no other cars around, the night was clear and we observed it thoroughly - the object was only silhouetted, between the lights, no details were noticed - no noise or anything heard, other than the sounds of the car - we intend to submit a report to the project blue book.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from Craig Colorado, dated July 29, 1963, addressed to an unnamed recipient. The letter describes an observation of an unidentified object in the sky over the surrounding National Forests in Craig, Colorado. The observer, Craig Colorado, believed the object to be a satellite in orbit and provided details about its flashing lights and movement. The letter concludes with a request for the recipient to consider the report and not want it to be taken as a "flying saucer or hoax report."

CRAIG COLORADO.
JULY 29, 1963. 
BOX 132,

SIRS:
I, AM A CITY PATROLMAN HERE IN CRAIG, COLORADO IN THE COUNTY OF MOFFAT, AND WAS COMING HOME FROM DUTY AT ABOUT 11:45 PM ON THE MORNING OF JULY 29, 1963 AND SEEN AN OBJECT BURN UP UPON ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE, WHILE TRAVELING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. THE OBJECT WAS REDDISH IN COLOR AND SEEMED TO BURN UP IN A FLASH. IT MADE NO SOUND AND WAS VISIBLE FOR ONLY ABOUT 2 SECONDS. AFTER THE FLASH, IT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE SURROUNDING NATIONAL FORESTS. - OR IN THE EVENT OF A MISSING OR CRASHED SATELLITES, IT WAS PUT OUT IN ITS ENTIRETY. 

I BELIEVE THE OBJECT TO BE A SATELLITE IN ORBIT, AS IT LOOKS MUCH LIKE THOSE SAME SATELLITE SIGHTINGS ONE HEARS ABOUT SO MUCH. IT FLASHES QUITE BRILLIANTLY ABOUT EVERY 5 SECONDS OR SO AND BREAKS THE DARKNESS EVERY 5 SECONDS OR SO AND IS APPARANTLY BLUE IN COLOR. 

IN GOING OVER THIS REPORT TO BE HELPFUL AND DONT WANT IT TO BE TAKEN AS A FLYING SAUCER OR HOAX REPORTS. AT SAME TIME I CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR THIS LIGHT AND MAKE NOTE OF THE TIME AND CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR IT. WHILE I HEAR FROM YOU.

SINCERELY.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and a compass rose. The diagram appears to be showing the path or motion of an object or objects, and the compass rose is likely intended to provide context for the diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the points shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass rose where you first saw the object.
