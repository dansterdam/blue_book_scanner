10. CONCLUSION: 
1. Visual: UFO observed
2. Radar: Objects detected on RAPCON/AICAMOBI HERCIO CONDITIONS) scope
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
At approximately 0720 and 0735L, the radar observers detected and tracked two unidentified bright objects at a range between 020 and 045 miles, traveling at an indicated speed of between 500-600 knots. The objects appeared at their scope for about 10-15 minutes and then disappeared from their scope. The radar operators reported that the objects were observed through binoculars and appeared to be flat, circular, and silver in color. Their flight paths were varying and erratic. Their main change in direction appeared to be a sharp banking turn. The radar operators attempted to get airborne intercept aircraft to the area but they were unable to make visual contact.

REPORT
31 May 1965
Director of Special Investigations
Edwards Air Force Base, California
Washington, D.C.
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon
1. At approximately 1615 hours on 30 May 1965, the undersigned observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon while on routine patrol at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
2. The object in question was first observed at an estimated altitude of 15,000 feet and appeared to be metallic in nature, reflecting sunlight. The object was moving at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 knots.
3. After approximately 30 seconds of observation, the object rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.
4. Attached are two photographs taken of the object during the observation. The quality of the images is poor due to the high speed and altitude of the object.

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE CALIFORNIA

On Tuesday, October 8, 1965, at 12:40 a.m. the commanding officer at Edwards Air Force Base, California received a call from an airman stationed at a remote location on the base concerning a strange light that he had observed in the sky. The airman stated that at approximately 12:30 a.m. he had observed a strange light in the sky that was moving in a northerly direction. He watched it for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view. The light was described as being very bright and about the size of a basketball. It was moving at a fairly rapid speed and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet.

The commanding officer immediately dispatched two security policemen to investigate the sighting. Upon arriving at the remote location, the security policemen also observed the strange light in the sky. They watched it for several minutes before it suddenly disappeared from view.

The commanding officer then notified the Air Force Missile Development Center at Edwards of the sighting. The Air Force Missile Development Center stated that they had no missile or aircraft activities scheduled in the area at that time.

A thorough search of the area was conducted but no further evidence of the strange light was found. The incident was classified as an unidentified flying object.

Text from the document:

SITUATION: At approximately 0030 hours on 8 October 1965, a telephone call was received from the Provost Marshal's Office, Edwards AFB, California, reporting that a bright light had been sighted in the sky approximately 10 miles northeast of the base. The light was described as a very brilliant, sharply defined object which hovered for several minutes and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. The object was observed by several people including the Security Police and was reported to be approximately 1/4 mile in diameter.

INVESTIGATION: On the night of 8 October 1965, this writer and the Base Intelligence Officer proceeded to the area of Edwards AFB, California, where the unidentified object had been sighted. Upon arrival at the base, we were immediately taken to the Provost Marshal's Office where several eyewitness statements were obtained. The witnesses, all of whom were military personnel, stated that at approximately 0030 hours they had observed a very bright light in the sky approximately 10 miles northeast of the base. The light was described as being sharply defined and hovering for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. One witness stated that the object appeared to be approximately 1/4 mile in diameter.

This writer and the Base Intelligence Officer then proceeded to the area where the object had been sighted and conducted a thorough search of the area. No evidence of the object was found and no additional witnesses were located.

CONCLUSION: Based on the eyewitness statements and the lack of any physical evidence, this incident is classified as unidentified. The object observed by the witnesses does not correspond to any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object also indicates that it was not a conventional aircraft. Therefore, this incident must be classified as a UFO.

1. The following report of UFOs is submitted per para 1a, AFR 200-2.
a. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS:
(1) All objects had the general shape and appearance of stars.
(2) The largest appeared to be twice the size of an ordinary star. The objects were brighter than stars.
(3) The objects were the same color as stars.
(4) There were from 7 to 12 objects involved.
(5) There was no discernible formation, as the objects seemed to be scattered about in an irregular pattern. Three of the objects appeared to be in what might be described as an inverted "V" formation.
(6) The objects that were held visually appeared to be flashing, red, green and white lights at some time or another.
(7) None
(8) None
(9) One of the objects was reported as "pulsing a small cloud in front of it." This is the same object that could be explained as a weather balloon.
b. DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECTS:
(1) The Edwards tower operator first noticed flashing lights from these objects in the normal course of his duties.
(2) The first and most pronounced change objects was originally observed at an elevation of 010° and an azimuth of 025°. The other objects seemed to follow the same general direction and elevation.

Appeared to have an elevation of between 9,000 and 10,000 and estimated to be coming to an altitude of 900 to 1,000 feet. The object was observed to demonstrate characteristics consistent with the visual sightings, Those were reported to be spherical or round in shape, having a bright light or light green colored glow. All were able to show contacts in the area under consideration. The duration of more or less solid contact was from 5 to 15 minutes.

The direction of motion observed was variable, some practically stationary, some moving at a high rate of speed, and in different directions. Some were observed to ascend rapidly, others to descend rapidly, and generally no discernible pattern of motion was detected. The duration of most sightings was from 5 to 15 minutes, a few longer.

The objects were observed to ascend and descend rapidly at times in straight lines, also to make very sharp turns and maneuvers not conductive to known aircraft. The objects were under very close observation but it was not possible to gain access to take photographs or make other observations that would positively identify these phenomena.

(a) The objects appeared uniformly gray or dark in color, and were seen to leave trails or exhaust that appeared whitish in color, which disappeared rapidly, evidencing considerable speed. The size from a distance appeared to vary from objects smaller than a star to objects easily as large as a small aircraft.

(b) Three of the objects held visually just generally passed over the area surveyed, were observed for a short time and disappeared. Some stayed and persisted, looking like all the other objects observed.

The first observation took place at 0535 (0135 GMT). The four most persistent objects maneuvered around and were observed until dawn although they ceased activity after two hours. The other objects came and went, some as they had been observed, in a period of 30 minutes.

The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The document appears to be related to an incident that occurred at Edwards Air Force Base, California on October 8, 1965.

The document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a written report or narrative describing the incident.

OCR output:

Regarding the aircraft. Passes were made through the area at 15,000, 19,000 and 20,000 ft. The only thing out of the ordinary observed was a reflection of some kind that looked like a flashing light. The observers could not determine the exact nature of the object or the source of the reflections. He felt that these were reflections from something other than the aircraft.

During the period of the sightings, there was no air traffic nor were there balloon releases that might have been mistaken for the objects.

COMMENTS:

It was approximately 10:00p.m. (2300 EDT) when I arrived at Edwards base Operations. The activity level had subsided by what they said was the departure of 15 aircraft. They were all going to different airfields and were not involved with any special exercises or flights. The observers could not provide any additional details that I may add flashing lights. The objects looked like reflections but did not seem to flicker. I certainly saw no distinct intermittent lights as described. The shape of the objects observed was not clear, and there was no additional information as to what they had seen earlier.

There are two portions of the taped conversation which necessitate elaborate expansion. The first is three comments made directly in the body of the report. These specifically state that nothing more was seen or heard from the objects after the period under discussion, and that they appeared only briefly during that time. No visual or instrument contact was made with the objects, and the observation was only visual.

The second portion deals with an oral clarification made by the same individual who provided the initial report. In this he stated that, although this was the only Balloon release during the period involved, it may be a significant clue, since Balloon releases are not commonly observed overhead at such airfields and at that time of night. More detailed investigation of Balloon releases in the area would be indicated.

- page 20 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a typed document or report.

THIS OTHER PORTION OF THE TAPED CONVERSATION THAT MERITS FURTHER CONSIDERATION DEALS MAINLY WITH THE APPEARANCE OF SOME OBJECT OR LIGHT IN THE SKY WHICH A TELEPHONE COMPANY EMPLOYEE WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE SEEN. ACCORDING TO THE CONVERSATION, SOME EMPLOYEE OF THE TELEPHONE COMPANY CALLED IN A REPORT AT 8:00 P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 19, 1965 THAT HE HAD SEEN AN OBJECT IN THE SKY. HE ALLEGEDLY TOLD THE SUPERVISOR THAT HE HAD BEEN CALLED BY AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TELEPHONE COMPANY WHO APPARENTLY HAD SEEN SOMETHING IN THE SKY AND WANTED TO REPORT IT.

THE SUPERVISOR APPARENTLY COMMUNICATED THIS INFORMATION TO OTHERS AND ONE OF THEM IS REPORTED TO HAVE ALLEGED THAT THE SUPERVISOR HAD SEEN THE OBJECT, BUT THE SUPERVISOR DENIED THIS. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE MOVED RAPIDLY AND THEN APPEARED TO REMAIN STATIONARY FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE MOVING OFF AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.

THE REPORT MENTIONS A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN WHO WAS INTERVIEWED LATER AND WHO IS SAID TO HAVE CONFIRMED THAT HIS CAR RADIO HAD INTERFERED WITH THE RECEPTION JUST ABOUT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.

I AM VERY IMPRESSED BY THIS PORTION OF THE INCIDENT. PEOPLE AT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY APPARENTLY KNOW THAT SOME EMPLOYEES SAW SOMETHING IN THE SKY THAT EVENING THAT THEY FEEL WARRANTS FURTHER INQUIRY. IT SEEMS TO BE MORE THAN THE USUAL UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT REPORT AND THERE IS AN IMPLICATION THAT SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL AND OUT OF THE ORDINARY OCCURRED. THERE WAS APPARENTLY SOME RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF SOME TO PROVIDE FULL INFORMATION, ORIGINALLY QUERIED BY THE REPORT'S WRITER, UNTIL THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN ASSURANCES THAT THE INFORMATION WOULD BE TREATED IN CONFIDENCE.

AS IT HAPPENED, THE OBSERVERS WERE ALL FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS (THAT IS, OTHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT THAT SUBMITTED THE REPORT) WHO HAD BEEN CALLED IN TO ASSIST TEMPORARILY AND DID NOT NORMALLY WORK IN THE BUILDING. THIS, IN ITSELF, MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A RELUCTANCE TO PROVIDE FULL DETAILS SINCE THESE EMPLOYEES PERHAPS DID NOT FEEL FULLY AUTHORIZED OR EXPECTED TO REPORT ON SUCH MATTERS.

IN SUMMARY, DO YOU IN THE AIR DEFENSE COMMAND COULD PROVIDE A KNOWLEDGEABLE ANALYSIS AND PERHAPS DETERMINE IF THERE IS INDEED SUBSTANCE TO THE INCIDENT SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

NO HELP. There seems to be no question that they did have visual contact of some sort of flashing lights for which they could offer no explanation that they considered satisfactory. The project case officer concurs in conclosion that what was observed could not be explained on the basis of any known physical phenomena
EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE:
There are no radar scope photos which indicate unidentified targets. There are no meterological data to include winds, etc. to assist in determining the nature of this report.

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Radar Scope Photos

REFERENCE is made to AFPRO letter of 21 December 1965, subject: "Technical Evaluation of Radar Scope Photos".

The following comments pertain to the radar observations:

a. It is to be noted that the technical evaluation of this report is limited in scope and is frequency of the scope presentation, but changes in operation made during maintenance and on general radar conditions.
b. The variations in the scope presentation are so extensive that it is impossible to determine real targets from false target indications due to the condition of the radar. These variations include:
(1) Is this weather radar?
(2) Was the antenna file angle varied?
(3) Was MT or other circuit variations switched in or out during the observations?

c. It appears obvious that considering the large number of returns, the general lack of appreciable speed in azimuth, and the randomness of their activity, these targets were NOT material targets, but rather represented various forms of electrical interference, which will be commented on individually and briefly.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image contains a single photograph of some unidentified flying object or phenomenon. The text on the document discusses various details and observations related to the image, including descriptions of the object, potential explanations, and the conclusions drawn from the incident.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

1. Clouds - Apparently can be ruled out, because the report says visual sightings and district shape, and visual do not agree.

2. Operator error - No evidence or indication of this. Photos look the same as the visual sightings.

3. Jamming - Normal jamming doesn't look like this. Visual sightings don't correspond.

4. Interference (man-made, or other radar) - Doesn't normally look like this on the scope. Visual sightings could seem to validate.

5. Equipment malfunction - Highly unlikely, primarily because of visual sightings, and also due to randomness of the returns.

6. Anomalous propagation - Although there evidently was no temperature inversion during the period, anomalous propagation is the most likely cause considered. (Radar returns could be distorted but visual sightings are both electromagnetic in nature, variations in the density of the atmosphere could affect both.)

3. Conclusion - It is concluded that the only logical explanation that fits all the data is anomalous propagation. The appearance (size, shape, movement) and randomness of the radar returns are characteristic of that.

1. Attached photo prints illustrate graphically the radical changes that occurred in the shape (reflected) and intensity of the return (brightness) which is an indication of the time involved.
