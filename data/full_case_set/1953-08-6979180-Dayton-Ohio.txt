The text in the document is as follows:

AF FORM 112--PART I
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO: 6979180
AREA: Dayton, Ohio
DATE OF REPORT: 3 August 1953
REPORT BY: (Deleted, G-2, U.S. Army)
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
SUMMARY: On 3 August 1953, at approximately 2100 - 2200 hours, two unidentified luminous objects were observed by two independent observers for approximately 15-20 minutes. The objects, described as being larger than most stars and brighter than a planet, were first observed between Indian Ripple Road and 35 Bridge, Centerville, Ohio. The objects were observed to hover, change direction, and disappear in a gradual curve and disappearance. Total number of objects observed was two. Estimated size - not determined. Estimated distance - not determined. Estimated speed - 400 mph minimum, but probably much higher. The significance of this report has been determined by this office.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 1
PAGE 3 OF 3

The report contains the following text:

We were going along the upper Bellbrook Road and I noticed what appeared to be an illuminated object in the sky. At first I thought it was just an aircraft, but as I kept my eyes on it I noticed that it stopped, hovered for a short while and then took off at a terrific speed. It was still high in the sky, and I would estimate about eight or ten thousand feet. As it took off, it made a circle to the left and then zoomed straight up and was out of sight in a northeast direction. It just disappeared somewhere over Xenia. They turned the lights out of it.

I have never seen anything else of an unusual nature. This thing didn't make any sound that I could distinguish, and it was certainly not an aircraft as we know them. The lights were so brilliant that they illuminated the ground beneath it. They appeared to be clear white lights, evidently, from the glow, some kind of a light or instrument on the object.

STATEMENT OF: _ , PACKING, DIR, SUPPLY AND SERVICES, GENTILE AF DEPOT
DAYTON, OHIO

I was driving along the Indian Riffle Road and before we turned off on the private road, I observed the objects. They seemed to be traveling at a rapid rate of speed and it was 4 or 5 miles before they stopped. It looked like something change like the back part was a different color of a star, real bright. I stopped the car and watched them. It just floated up, then it got real bright. It was real bright. It seemed to be going straight up about 20 minutes and then got dim and I never did see it again. It just faded away kind of in a gradual circle, and just faded away. I suppose it was possibly about 3 or 4 miles high. There was nothing else in the sky but the moon. It was about three or four miles and it went off on the northeastern direction. I have never noticed any such objects before.
