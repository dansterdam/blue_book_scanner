Memo (AFCIN-4E), 19 Apr 61. Request for Review
1st Ind (AFCIN-4E/Wr. Bryant/je/74201) 9 May 61
TO: AFCIN-4E (Maj Friend)

1. The report dated 14 Apr 61 from Anderson AEIR has insufficient information upon which to base an evaluation. For example, "Description of the target was not given." The report dated 17 Apr 61 has been studied and evaluation indicates the only possibility is the target was dust. The mechanically large size shown on the film is not indicative of a saucer-shaped object, however. Other possibilities, such as abnormal propagation of equipment malfunction, are other possibilities. Check should be made to determine if meteorology body could explain the object.

2. Evaluation of report from 664th ACW Sq. Yuma, Ariz., dated 28 Feb 61. Indicates Chief (drop in more plausible explanation. Check of Air Force activities for possible search exercise could be made.
