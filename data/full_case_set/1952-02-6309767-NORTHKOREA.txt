The text in the document is as follows:

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On the night of 24 February 1952, at 2315 local Korean time, the navigator of a B-29 observed an unidentified aerial object. The B-29 was picked up by searchlights and about 45 seconds later the navigator sighted an object approaching from 7 o'clock. The object was estimated to be over anything at this time. The object did not appear to be illuminated in front and had a reddish glow. The object maintained this course for four or five minutes and then made three times the length of the object with both the tail blast and the object bright in color.
When first observed the object appeared to be climbing at 45Â°, however, it leveled off at approximately 4,000 ft. from the B-29 and turned toward the B-29. As it approached the B-29, the object continued to close in and made a rapid turn and headed down, passing under the B-29 at a steep angle. As the object began to descend the flame diminished in size and got brighter. The navigator estimated that the object came within 3000 ft. of the aircraft and his appeared to be the size of an automobile (Assumed to mean the same size as an automobile viewed from 2,000 ft.).
The B-29 was flying at 22,000 ft., altitude and at a speed of 200 knots. The characteristics stayed with the aircraft for approximately four minutes and weak inaccurate flak was encountered during the entire incident.
Weak electronic signals were picked up by the electronic counter-measures operator for a short time.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
More details on the sighting have been requested from FEAF. Since the object resembles a surface-to-air guided missile, the incident has been referred to the ATIC guided missiles group.

Reference C-4446 FOR CO DRAK JAPTO-23B
dated 26 February 1952, re sighting of objects on night of 24 February 1952. Based on performance deduced from the reported information, object appears to be a subsonic surface-to-air guided missile, possibly of the German Schmetterling type. Current estimates credit the Soviets with the capability of having an operational surface-to-air guided missile of this type now, although until this time there has been no intelligence on which to credit the Soviets with more than a capability of having some complete information of this sighting will be made upon receipt of complete information from FTAC.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object
DATE: 12-1-52
PLACE: Near Chosan, North Korea

At 12/341, a pilot of the 4th Fighter Wing was on a routine training mission in the vicinity of Chosan, North Korea, when he sighted an unusual object in the sky. The pilot stated that the object, which appeared to be elliptical in shape, was traveling at a speed estimated to be approximately 500 knots and at an altitude of 36,000 ft.  

The object was observed for approximately three to five minutes. It appeared to be silver in color and object appeared to approach and then move away from the pilot's aircraft. The pilot stated that the object was traveling at a much higher rate of speed than his own aircraft which was traveling at 600 knots. Four light flashes were observed coming from the object. The pilot was unable to close within firing range of the object.

Navigator who observed object is a captain. Served in WWII as a pilot and is considered a competent and reliable observer. He is the only witness of this incident.

Comments of Interrogating Officer: Bright blue-flame exhaust suggests possibility of electronic guidance and possibility of electronic guiding device.
