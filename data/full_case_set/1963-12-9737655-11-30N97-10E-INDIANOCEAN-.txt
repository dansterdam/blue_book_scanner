1. Reference the attached letter from SPADATS giving an unidentified flying object sighting. Based on the information given, it appears to be a satellite decay.
2. A week with SPADATS shows that this is a regular occurrence. The report from NORAD indicated the passage of a satellite through the atmosphere. The attached SPADATS report confirms this observatory.
Although SPADATS records show an object was detected and his crew has all the characteristics, the information has little operational significance.

S. S. " Rangoon "
Rangoon,
29th September 1963.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
Washington, D.C.,
U.S.A.

Dear Sirs,

I wish to report having observed what I believe to have been a celestial body or disc-like object, and disintegration of a satellite. Details of this observation are tabulated below.

The initial observation was to classify this object as a satellite. This conclusion was based on the fact that the object seemed to be at a great height, and had the characteristics of a satellite. However, during the course of the observation, the object began to exhibit peculiar characteristics, which led me to conclude that this was not a satellite, but some other celestial body or disc-like object.

On reaching its zenith or highest point, the object suddenly began to disintegrate. This disintegration took place within a matter of seconds, and was accompanied by a trail of luminous particles, which were clearly visible. The disintegration was not complete, in that some fragments continued on their original trajectory. The fragments were visible for several minutes thereafter.

On recording its path, this object was found to be travelling on a trajectory roughly parallel with the earth's surface, and the duration of the observation was 55 seconds.

I trust this report will be of interest to your organization.

Yours faithfully,
Asiatic Steam Navigation Company, LD.
