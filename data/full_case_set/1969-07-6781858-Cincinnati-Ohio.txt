The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document containing a report about the treatment of a civilian caller on July 4, 1969.

The text of the document is as follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJ: Treatment of Civilian Caller

1. At approximately 2100 hours EDT, 4 July 1969, Sgt ZEP Dispatch, 5th Command Post Controller, took a phone call from a citizen in CINCINNATI, KENTUCKY. Mr. ZP stated that he might be witness to an Unidentified Flying Object, and asked if there was any known aircraft traffic in his area. Sgt Dispatch referred Mr. ZP to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Operations, advising that they might be able to answer his question about possible aircraft.

2. At approximately 2125 hours, Mrs. ZP, extremely irate because of the treatment her husband had received from Sgt Dispatch, called the FTD Command Post. She placed that a man who had identified himself as Mr. ZP had suggested that Mr. ZP had been picking too much, and that he should forget the whole matter. She related that both she and her husband had worked at their regular jobs on 4 July 1969, and that neither of them had questioned any incidents of lights on that day or as a normal practice.

3. AF Form 117, Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire, was completed at the request of the staff Duty Officer, and an apology was made for the behavior of Mr. ZP.

4. It is recommended that the Commander, FTD, bring the alleged behavior of Mr. ZP to the attention of the base Commander, and that the opinion of the staff Duty Officer and his controller at the time be obtained, to afford adverse publicity in the United States Air Force at a time when it can least afford adverser publicity in any area of endeavor.

WILLIAM C. LEWIS, 1 LT, USAF
STAFF DUTY OFFICER
3 July 1969

The image contains a photograph, specifically a sketch or diagram. The sketch appears to be part of a "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire" form. It shows a simple angular diagram with an observer's point marked, likely meant to illustrate the angular elevation of the observed object.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ON THE UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED.

- page 6 -

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose with detailed compass directions, likely used to indicate the position of a phenomenon when it was first seen. The two smaller sketches at the bottom appear to show a person walking on a road through a hilly landscape.

The text output from the OCR system is as follows:

G.A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU THINK THE PHENOMENA WAS MOVING OR APPEARED TO MOVE WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "?" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU THINK THE PHENOMENA MOVED TO AFTERWARDS.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENA WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "?" AT THE POSITION TO WHICH IT APPEARED TO MOVE. INDICATE ON THE SKETCH WHETHER THE MOTION WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a form with various check boxes and handwritten responses.

STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY? 
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?

CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OR FLICKER? 
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?

IS WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

The handwritten responses indicate that the object "suddenly speed up and run away" and that it would "Want to be kind to us".

- page 10 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text. The text appears to provide instructions for a survey or experiment related to the "angular size" of an unspecified object. The instructions ask to hold a match at arm's length in front of a "known object" and estimate what fraction of the object's size the match covers.

The text in the image is as follows:

"Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon. Include and label any details that night give indication as to the phenomenons origin.

What was the angular size, held a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a streetlight. Note if you have been able to perform this experiment at the time of the sighting. Estimate what fraction of the phenomenon would have been covered by the match head.
