Dear Sirs:
I am a very firm believer in U.F.O.'s. Just why I looked out the window and saw the constellation of one of the stars (Orion constellation) turned direction on a 90 degree from its normal position, around @ 10:15 PM the night of November 11, 1967. This direction is approximately 10:00 to 7:30 position of the object. The reason I write to you is because just the other night, Nov. 10, at 6:30 PM, I not only saw it but I had this good friend to observe it. She was quite certain that what we saw on November 11 was not the same object, but something else altogether. My age is 13 & my friend is near my age & we read a number of books pertaining to "Project Blue Book" related & Flying Saucers - various business related Edwards, & numerous magazines that come once a month. I have no other observer.

The report asks various questions about the observed behavior of the UFO, such as whether it moved in a straight line, stood still, suddenly sped up, broke apart, changed brightness, spun, made noise, or caught the observer's attention in some other way. The bottom of the form appears to have a handwritten description of what was observed, though the text is not entirely legible in the provided image.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:

"We were walking through a wooded area when I saw a very bright light of the moon. It had to have been at least 60 feet away indicated the object started to what the moon and light went off to the other direction. Light seemed to be shut off to the other direction. Possible could have gone into woods before light was finally off. If possible would you send me any information on Project Blue Book.
It seemed to be too bright to be a star or Comet - and moved too fast to be the moon."
