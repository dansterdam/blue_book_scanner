"BIG EXPLOSION REPORTED
MYSTERIOUS OBJECT IN SKY
(New Zealand Press Association)

WELLINGTON, February 9 - 
A mysterious explosion of terrific force had shaken the west coast of New Zealand's South Island the day before.

Eyewitnesses reported a mysterious object was observed in the sky near Greymouth. The object described as cigar-shaped and emitting a dazzling light and traveling at high speed. They said it lost altitude as it moved inland toward the Southern Alps.

The explosion was heard and felt in an area of several hundred square miles."

Text extracted from the document:

METEORITE--OR WHAT?

Mysterious Green Fireball Brightens Night Over Texas

TYLER, TEX., Feb. 14 (/p)--There were unconfirmed reports that a weird green light shot across the sky last night and that it exploded over an airport control tower.

Word of the phenomenon spread quickly and the Weather Bureau at Dallas got several reports of people seeing the glow over northeast Texas last Sunday night.

It was apparently a meteorite.

Here's his story: "Around midnight this light
appeared, brighter and larger than electrical storms often are. It appeared to be going steadily along, not like a shooting star." It was green, like an electric arc, and was greener toward the trailing end, which flickered like a flame.

"IT WAS going due south. There were three of us in the house at the time. The light illuminated the whole room like a blinding light. It was on for about 15 seconds.

"About 30 degrees above the horizon, it made a sharp turn to the east, then disappeared into the distance. We watched it disappear to the south."

THE MOST vivid account came from J. N. Auer, control tower operator at Pounds Field here. "It looked like a giant flare, burning brightly," he said. "It lasted for about 5 seconds."

The image contains a newspaper clipping with the title "Radioactive Fiber at Horseheads". The article discusses an incident in Horseheads, New York where a "wispy gray fuzz of badly damaged cotton fiber" was found to be radioactive. The article mentions that this was one of three incidents reported in the area during February 1955.

Text from the document:

Radioactive Fiber At Horseheads
HORSEHEADS, N.Y., Feb. 22 - Dr. Charles H. Steinmetz, chemistry professor at Elmira College, identified today a certain amount of wispy gray fuzz as radioactive.
This fuzz, he said, spread over parts of this village 12 miles north of Elmira. Dr. Steinmetz said the fuzz may have come from a nearby community when the strong winds occurred.
Where the fuzz came from remained a mystery, Dr. Steinmetz said, tests revealed that the other two incidents in this area during the past few months (Horseheads, N.Y., February 24, 1955) the residue was identified as waste products from the local milk plant.

In one of the three incidents reported in other months (Horseheads, New York, February 24, 1955) the mixed hair was identified as waste products from the local milk plant.

On February 24, at Horseheads, N.Y., there fell a wispy gray fuzz of badly damaged cotton fiber. It was radioactive.

AN AEROPOST AIRLINER* PILOTED BY CAPTAIN DOUGLAS FARQUHARSCON, A FAMOUS VENEZUELAN WHO FLEW IT WAS A CLEAR DAY, WITH VISIBILITY UNLIMITED, UNTIL 11:15 A.M. THE FLIGHT WAS NORMAL. SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY A STRANGE ROUND APPARATUS WAS FLYING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE PLANE. ROTATING COUNTERCLOCKWISE, THE MYSTERIOUS MACHINE SHONE WITH A GREENISH LIGHT. AROUND ITS CENTER WAS A RED RING OR BAND WHICH EMITTED FLASHES OF BRILLIANT LIGHT. ABOVE AND BELOW THIS BAND WERE WHAT APPEARED TO BE LIGHTED PORTHOLES.
HURDLING CAPTAIN FARQUHARSCON AND HIS MIKE TO CALL THE BARQUISIMETO RADIO STATION, *HE REPORTED THE OBJECT. HE WAITED FOR AN ANSWER. BUT THE RECEIVER HAD GONE DEAD. (LATER THE BARQUISIMETO RADIO OPERATORS STATED THAT JUST AS CAPTAIN FARQUHARSCON HAD BEGUN HIS REPORT, COMMUNICATION WAS CUT OFF.)
AS CAPTAIN FARQUHARSCON WENT BACK TO ALERT THE PASSENGERS, THE ROTATING UFO. INSTANTLY THE OBJECT VANISHED, THEN LEVELING OFF, IT RACED AWAY AT TREMENDOUS SPEED.
WHEN THE PLANE LANDED, THE PILOTS LEARNED OF THE SUDDEN BREAK IN RADIO COMMUNICATION -- NOT ONLY AT BARQUISIMETO BUT AT VALERA, WHICH WAS ALSO RECEIVING THE INFORMATION. NOT UNTIL THE PLANE REACHED VALERA AIRPORT HAD THE RADIO RESUMED NORMAL OPERATION.
BUT NOW, SAID CAPTAIN FARQUHARSCON, *NOT ONLY ARE WE CONVINCED OF THEIR EXISTENCE, BUT ALSO THAT THEY ARE CONTROLLED...*THIS WAS THE MOST SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF MY CAREER AS A PILOT, AND I WILL REMEMBER THE INCIDENT FOREVER.*
THE PILOTS' DETAILED REPORT, WHICH MADE FRONT PAGE HEADLINES, WAS FULLY CONFIRMED BY THE PASSENGERS.*

Brilliant meteors of a particularly fragile structure, which seldom deposit recoverable fragments, are common in February. Unusually, this month has also produced many fantastic UFO reports. According to various source publications, for example, in the nights between February 3 and February 14, 1955, the skies were thick with weird machines from beyond the earth.

On February 2, at 11:45 A.M. an airliner flying over Venezuela chased a strange object that was moving swiftly toward the plane. Rotating counterclockwise, the mysterious machine shone with a greenish light. Around its center was a red ring or band which emitted flashes of brilliant light. Above and below this were lighted portions. As the pilot banked the plane, the object whirled downward, leveled off, and raced away at tremendous speed. The flyers told reporters that although they had never believed in flying saucers, they now were convinced of their existence and of their being controlled. After investigating the few specific facts obtained from fatuous, unscientific daytime statements, we cannot conclude (a detailed description of unusual daylight fare, the details being founded by greenish gases, breaking up into fragments that burn up in a brilliant flash. Three nights later, on February 5, the ocean liner Vera Cruz (time and position not stated) supposedly reported that a "large, luminous craft, cruising at a fantastic speed" passed above the ship [S. p.295]. On the night of February 7 the pilot of an Eastern Airlines flight over Florida saw what looked like a ball of fire, ten or fifteen feet in diameter. Three similar objects "much brighter than aircraft lights" were sighted in the same area between 7:55 and 8:35 P.M. La Guardia Airport in New York (time and position not given) was passed by "two strange indistinguishable objects" [S. p.295]. On February 14 shortly before midnight a swiftly moving "green fireball" was seen from Texas to Mississippi, so blindingly brilliant that it lighted up a whole room [S. p.266].

Not one of these descriptive provisions provides enough factual information to allow positive identification, but every one fits the usual meteor pattern. It is highly probable that all these "UFO" were merely meteors.

The text in the document is as follows:

Coasters Startled by Meteorite
PALM SPRINGS, Calif., Feb. 6 (UP) - Coasters in this resort area reported seeing a "comet-like object" in the sky yesterday which turned out to be a bright meteor shooting toward the earth. 
The object, which was observed by hundreds of people, appeared suddenly in the sky about 5 p.m. (PST) and traveled swiftly toward the earth, witnesses said.
It was described as a ball of fire, about the size of a football, with a long tail trailing behind. The object disintegrated before reaching the earth, they added.
The report said "it turned the sky as bright as day" and was "as bright as a flash bulb."
It was reported that the object was seen as far north as Los Angeles and as far south as the Mexican border.
FLASH' ALSO SIGHTED AT ASHBURTON
ASHBURTON, England, Feb. 7 (Reuters) -- A bright flash of light was seen in the skies over this town yesterday, a defense ministry spokesman said today.
The spokesman said the flash, which was seen over a wide area, was probably caused by a meteor. He said numerous reports had been received from eyewitnesses, including some Royal Air Force personnel at a nearby base.
The spokesman said there was no evidence of any aircraft or other solid object in the sky at the time the flash was observed. He said the phenomenon was probably similar to that observed over the United States yesterday.
