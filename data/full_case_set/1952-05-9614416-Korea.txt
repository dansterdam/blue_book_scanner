TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

UNCLASSIFIED
REPORT NO. 52-106
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object
AREA REPORTED: Korea
LOCATION: Kaesung, Korea
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 11 June 1952
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 0800 to 0930 hrs
DESCRIPTION: This report contains information obtained from 2-94 crew members who experienced a visual sighting and observation of an unidentified flying object. The object was observed to be stationary and hovering at an estimated altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. It was circular in shape, silver in color and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It remained stationary for a period of approximately 30 minutes and then accelerated and climbed rapidly out of sight. The crew members stated they were amazed at the brilliance and climbing ability of the object, and are convinced it was not any known type of aircraft.

UNCLASSIFIED
AF FORM 112 - PART II 
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1952
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. Det.1, 502nd G.I.R., HQ, APO 503 20-15E 3 OF 3 PAGES

Descriptive, positive, and are as accurate as possible at this moment. This object observed crew and all officers saw visually from a distance of approx. 2 miles and due to periodic changes in altitude and size it is difficult to give an accurate description as to size, shape, and design. However, the crew and all officers are convinced that this object was definitely under intelligent control. The speed, erratic maneuvers, and lifting and descending capabilities can only be explained by some means of propulsion other than conventional aircraft. The speed was estimated at approximately 600 mph. No noise or exhaust was observed, and no other similar aircraft were seen in the vicinity for comparison. Reporting officer believes that the object was manufactured, and was utilizing some unknown form of propulsion and is convinced that a detailed scientific investigation should be made of this phenomenon observed by the crew of this aircraft. 

DIST STAFF Comments:
1. The information presented describes an experience with those described by the ground observer. This corroborates the sighting (reference Case 1, Chorvon, 23-24 and 22-24).
2. The performance reported indicates that the object was possibly a flight test vehicle or unconventional aircraft.
3. The location of the sighting was just south of Chorvon, approximately 160 miles northwest of Seoul.
4. Due to the erratic maneuvers of the object it may have been impossible for the ground radar to have tracked the object.
5. No explanation can be readily arrived at, nor has any investigation been made for failure of the ground radar to detect the object.
