The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a flying saucer or unidentified flying object (UFO) over the city of Rochester, Minnesota. The headline "Guess What, Folks!" suggests that this is a purported sighting or report of a UFO in the local area.

CHESTER POST-BULLE ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA, MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1967 FLYING SAUCER IN ROCHESTER - OR WHAT? Pictures Taken by Mark Herbeck, H, through Livlog Room Window

The image contains a photograph depicting a blurry, indistinct object in the sky. The caption mentions that the photograph was taken by a "Local Lad" and shows a "Nearby Flying Object".

Local Lad Photographs
A Nearby Flying Object

By JOHN NOVOTNEY
If "don't really believes in flying saucers, there is at least one local youth who can't doubt their possible existence.
Mark Ifrtchitz, 12, son of Mr. and Mrs. Dick Ifrtchitz, 3144 3rd Ave. NE, made the remark after sighting the peculiar object.
They are the first reported observers in the Rochester district to get a photograph of what appears to be a flying saucer.
Mark said he looked out the window of the family home at about 5:15 on a Sunday evening and "just happened to see this thing there."
"We thought at first it was a plane, but it didn't move like an airplane and it stayed there for quite awhile." Mark said.
The object was over the street when he first saw it, but moved over the streets a little more and then "just shot up and out of sight."
Most of the boy's classmates at Washington Junior High School saw the object, "and they are really shocked at what we were able to photograph," he said.

He raced out to the kitchen, got his camera and took three pictures of the round object before it lifted up out of sight. It was in view for only about 45 seconds, and he could hear no sound from the object.
The boy was sincere when telling about the incident, and did not appear to be attempting to perpetrate a hoax.
This incident took place.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, possibly a Project Blue Book report, that describes an incident involving a person named Mark and his wife Mrs. Hrubetz. The text discusses Mark's hesitation to report something to the Air Force authorities, and his interest in astronomy and receiving a telescope for Christmas. The text also mentions that some people thought the "pictures" (likely referring to UFO sightings) were "pretty neat", but a few accused Mark of "rigging the pictures", which he denies.

Object
(Continued from page 1)
mates thought the pictures
were "pretty neat," Mark
said, but a few accused him
of rigging the pictures. He
insists he did not, and these
accusations have made him
reluctant to report it to Air
Force authorities.
"I am not about to let my
boy get up on the roof and
rig up something like that,"
Mrs. Hrubetz said, adding it
wouldn't be like him to do
that sort of thing, anyway.
Mark is interested in astronomy and got a telescope
for Christmas.
