Transcription of the text in the document:

At 1325 hours on 8 January 1967, a UFO sighting was reported to this office by Patrol Sergeant Jones, Illinois State Police. Sergeant Jones stated that at approximately 1320 hours, he and another officer were on routine patrol in the vicinity of Centreville, Illinois, when they observed a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky above a farm area approximately 15 miles west of their location. Sergeant Jones stated that the object appeared to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and was approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the ground. He further stated that the object was motionless for several minutes and then suddenly accelerated in a northwesterly direction and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. 

At 1355 hours, this office received a call from an unidentified caller who stated that he had also observed the same object from his residence in Centreville, Illinois. The caller stated that the object appeared to be metallic, disc-shaped, and was hovering in the sky for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing.

It is the opinion of this investigator that the object observed by Sergeant Jones and the unidentified caller was a genuine UFO incident. The descriptions of the object provided by the witnesses are consistent and the sudden acceleration and disappearance of the object are indicative of a high-performance, unconventional aircraft.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting a series of concentric circles with the label "Electrical Flashes" written below it. There does not appear to be any photographic image present in this document page.

"Electrical Flashes
About 1 minute before the object hit the ground a blue-white light appeared on top & 'electrical flashes' seemed to be coming from the object. The flashes appeared to be very rapid just before the object hit the ground and about the same time the object appeared to split in half or do something of that nature according to the witness."

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. The text states:

The text on the page is as follows:

22 January 1967

1. DG3 Howard E. Sweeney 359 380 USGS, was on Engineer-Security Watch at the USGS Loren Station Johnston Island, located on Sand Island in Johnston Atoll from the hours of 0000 - 0600. At approximately 0500, 22 January 1967, I sighted an object in the Northeast portion of the sky. The path of travel was to the West where it hovered over East Island at a low altitude and emitted a bright light from the vapor ring around it. The object was dish like in shape with a small dome on its top. The vapor ring about it was produced by gas given off from it. The object itself was a bright silver, which illuminated the vapor to a light gray. The object gained altitude and the vapor ring was not seen then, and at this time the object moved towards the West and disappeared out of sight around 0530. Its movement was fast, but you could still distinguish it from a star. The sky was cloudless, but after the object had passed and was out of sight, and after working for approximately 10 minutes, I looked up and the stars were now obscured.
