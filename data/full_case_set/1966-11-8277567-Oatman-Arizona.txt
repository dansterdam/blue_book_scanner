Dear Sirs:
The following are notes which I made of a certain object in the atmosphere and which looked to be fairly close, (several miles)

Nov. 24, '66 about 8:50'52 P.M., bright
light blue (about color of cone in gas flame),
took about 2-sec. to cross 27" diagonally a
window pane. I was sitting about 11' from
window. Object was from 6 to 7 inches in dia.
perfectly round, had reddish-orange streaks
in rear ending at a point about 2' in rear.
Point SEEMED on radio, I was looking almost
directly north(magnetic). Object was traveling from an easterly direction to westerly
about 20 degrees from vertical, (downward)

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]
