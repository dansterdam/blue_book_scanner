PART ELEVEN: R. SAULTER, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 99 BOMB WING (SAC): AT FIRST ANALYSIS, THE DESCRIPTION SEEMS TO FIT A STORY USING AN AFTERBURNER; HOWEVER, A CHECK OF ALL LOCAL FIGHTER UNITS IN THE VICINITY INDICATES THAT NO SUCH AIRCRAFT WERE AIRBORNE AT THE TIME. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A FIGHTER FROM AN AIRFIELD OUTSIDE THE LOCAL AREA WAS OPERATION HERE. HOWEVER, THE CLOUD COVER WOULD INDICATE THAT HE WAS VERY LOW AND THIS WOULD NOT BE A NORMAL ACTIVITY FOR THIS TIME OF NIGHT. PART TWELVE: L. NONE.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A bright, illuminated object viewed in the dark nighttime sky by an AF airman on security duty. The object is described as being larger than a star, changing color from white to amber to red to blue-green. The object was in a steady hovering position, and descended slowly and silently. Viewed by one witness and did not cause any damage or distress.
12. CONCLUSIONS
[X] Was Balloon
[X] Probably Balloon
[X] Was Aircraft
[ ] Possibly Aircraft
[X] Was Astronomical
[ ] Possibly Astronomical
[ ] Insufficient Data
[ ] Unknown
INITIAL SIGHTING OF STAR at 30 minutes duration - approx 1050. Object then distinguished from stars by color changes - to amber, red, blue-green - and hovering, descending motion. This is the only 1st hand object observation recorded here. Interpretation of astro-bodies may be 2nd hand or inferences from available data. Decision to forward to NORAD or other agencies, if any, is unknown.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page describes the details of a UFO sighting and the subsequent investigation.

Here is the text found in the document:

FLIGHT FIVE, MARCH 8, 1962. FLYING OBJECT WAS VIEWED AT WESTOVER AFB, LOOKING WEST-SOUTHWEST, ABOUT 6:05 P.M. SIGHTING TIME WAS ABOUT 5 TO 10 MINUTES. OBJECT APPEARED ROUND, WHITE IN COLOR, GAVE OFF CHANGING LIGHTS. OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 4 TO 5 MILES DISTANT AND AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 20,000 FEET. OBJECT MOVED RAPIDLY, THEN STOPPED, THEN MOVED AGAIN. IT WAS RULED OUT AFTER CHECKING WITH WEATHER AND FOUND NO METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA. IT WAS OBSERVED VISUALLY AND ON RADAR. THE OBJECT WAS TRACKED BY RADAR AND PLOTTED ON A SCOPE SHOWING RAPID CHANGES IN COURSE AND SPEED. THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED INTO HEAVY CLOUDS IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME.
