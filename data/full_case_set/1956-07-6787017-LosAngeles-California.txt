There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing only text describing a sighting of a mysterious light in the Los Angeles area on July 16, 1956.

Case 167, Los Angeles, Cal., July 16, 1956â€”We quote from the Los Angeles Examiner, as follows: "A mysterious light that glowed brilliantly in the sky before it disappeared in a sudden flash has caused more than 40 calls to police from residents in the southwestern area. Workers at the control tower at the International Airport estimated the altitude of the light. They said it emitted a strong reddish glow similar to the red nose light on a Constellation plane. But they said the light moved in a southeasterly direction at great speed. They couldn't estimate its speed, but said it moved at a blinding pace. A check, however, showed there was no blip or plane in the area at the time. The light was visible for about four minutes from 1:02 a.m. Then it suddenly blacked out forth in an eerie glow and vanished from sight."
