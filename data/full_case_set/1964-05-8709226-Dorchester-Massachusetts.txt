DEAR SIRS:
TONIGHT, WHILE WE WERE ON OUR BACK PORCH OBSERVING PLANES COMING INTO AND LEAVING LOGAN AIRPORT, WE SAY A VERY STRANGE OBJECT, AND REPORTED IT. OBSERVED IT VERY SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. IT WAS A VERY PECULIAR WHITE COLOR. ONCE HOWEVER, IT GREW DIM ALMOST TO THE POINT OF GOING OUT. IT MOVED IN A VERY ZIGZAG PATTERN WHICH WAS PRACTICALLY HORIZONTAL HOWEVER, SIGHTING LASTED SIX MINUTES UNTIL 10:01 P.M. UNTIL WE COULD NO LONGER OBSERVE IT. WEATHER WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR WITH MANY STARS VISIBLE. THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE DEBIT MOON AND APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH UP. IT SEEMED TO BE ROUND IN SHAPE.
SINCERELY

Dear ---

This is in reply to your letter of May 30, 1964. You reported seeing an object in the sky during the evening on that date.

The object which you described was observed by several other persons in the area at approximately 9:57 p.m. It was observed to move in a southeasterly direction at an estimated altitude of 2,000 - 2,500 feet above the horizon.

You both gave a very fine description of the object. However, the description made it possible to identify this aircraft quickly and positively.

Since the object has been identified, no further investigation is considered necessary.

Thank you for calling this matter to our attention.

Sincerely,

MASON U. JACKS
Public Information Division
Office of Information
Dorchester, Mass. 02122
