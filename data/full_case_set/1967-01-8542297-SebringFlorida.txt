PERSONAL SIGHTING ACCOUNT SYNOPSIS
Please write a brief account in your own words concerning your sighting of a UFO. The following information should be included:
1. What were you doing at the time of the sighting?
2. We were going to pick up our girl friend to go to the basketball game.
3. We were on Washington Street, Methuen.
4. I said "What's that?" I said jokingly, "It's a UFO." Then we began to wonder if what we had seen was something we had ever seen before. We became frightened and didn't know what to do.
5. I said the car stalled & the lights & radio went off. After that, the object seemed to fade away and we read in a magazine article about the reaction that people have on auto mobiles. I didn't believe this before.
6. The object was too large to be any kind of aircraft. The shape was odd & did not resemble a balloon or a helicopter.
7. I called my father and told him because he is interested in this. Next I thought that if this wasn't a UFO, what was it. Then I began to think how much more advanced these people must be that it seemed so close to us. I went to bed & tried to forget about other beings.
