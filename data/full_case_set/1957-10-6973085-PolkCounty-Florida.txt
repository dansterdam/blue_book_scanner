DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

28 October 1957

Dear Captain Elwood:

Senator - - - - - - Deputy Director called Brigadier General C. D. Young, 5455, to a large group concerned the USAF identification flights over Polk County, Florida at approximately 80,000 feet at night on 23 October 1957.

Senator - - - - - - was concerned because local residents called the Military Air Force Satellite center and questioned the flights which they observed over Polk County, Florida at approximately 80,000 feet. Allegedly all of these individuals indicated that they had to take no effort to investigate.

The people are disturbed about this attitude on the part of the Air Force and feel that the Air Force's responsibility was not properly sustained. It is requested that quarters immediately in accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 12 August 1954.

Will you please check your records to see if this sighting was reported to your headquarters from any other source. If an identification or evaluation of this sighting is possible, please send the results to me as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
CLARENCE J. PARKER

Dear Sir:

Reference your furnished to us with information concerning an unknown aerial object over Polk County, Florida, on 23 October 1957.

Details of this sighting of an unknown aerial object were obtained and analyzed by this Headquarters. The report of their findings is attached. The attached is considered as complete as possible under the circumstances.

On 5 May 1958, the Department of the Air Force declassification authority reviewed this case and determined that publication of reports on unidentified aerial objects, as in this case, may be made available to the public. On 23 October 1958, the Department of the Air Force further declassified this report and other reports of unidentified aerial objects.

It would seem from the information furnished that the Air Force has thoroughly investigated this matter and reports that there is a total lack of technical evidence that the object observed is other than a natural phenomena. There is a total lack of evidence that they are extraterrestrial devices.

There is a total lack of evidence that they are a threat to the security of the United States."

Letter to Honorable (Cont.)

Cases will not be made public. Most of the air force sightings are routinely denied, not discounted, to avoid public speculation and disclosure of our security methods.

The Air Force has not conceded the unidentified aerial objects as factual, but rather that the air force is unable to identify them by normal investigative means. There is at present no pattern or design to the sightings which would indicate a test of our security, or threat to our defense.

A new phase has been initiated by the commanding General, Air Defense Command, to instruct our Intelligence to determine if the unidentified aerial objects contain any hostile intent, or other phenomena which would include them in our air defense system.

Sincerely yours,

James B. Jones

Director of Air Force Intelligence

The document is a letter addressed to Captain Elwood, Assistant Adjutant at the Air Technical Intelligence Center in Ohio, discussing an investigation of UFO sightings in Polk County, Florida.

Here is the full text of the document:

HEADQUARTERS
AIR FORCE MISSILE TEST CENTER
AIR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMMAND
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
Patrick Air Force Base, Florida

1 Nov 57

Dear Captain Elwood:

This Center received a courtesy copy of Major L. J. Tacker's letter to you dated 25 October 1957, which has reference to reports of unidentified flying objects (UFO's) in Polk County...23 October 1957. It is believed that Polk County is the area referred to as No Type County in Florida.

An investigation has not uncovered any record of the reference made by Major Tacker to this Center. Four of the five sightings checked, maintain blotters and log cards which cover the period. The fifth sighting (A) cannot be definitely identified by the ARDC Staff Report Marshall.

It is regretted that this Center can not be of further assistance in this matter. A study by this office revealed that over 90% of the UFO calls are the result of sightings relating to our own activities (distant aircraft, balloons, weather checks), aircraft and reflection of the moon, planets, and stars on water and many other natural phenomena.

Sincerely yours,

ROBERT SARGENT, Captain, USAF

UFO SIGHTING, LAKE WALES
23 OCTOBER 1957
Reported on tape by 23/22002

Wednesday afternoon at approximately 3:00 I received a call. The call was from an observer who was telling me that there was an object in the sky at what he figured was 20 thousand feet.  There was an object there that it might be a weather balloon.  Orlando had nothing reported that it had launched a weather balloon. So I asked the observer to describe what he saw.  He said the object was about 40 feet in diameter and it was glowing.  We entered a piper apache aircraft (twin engine) and proceeded to the location.

We climbed to 16,500 feet over Haines City and had the object in view all the time. At 16,000 feet the object appeared to be 50 to 60 feet in diameter and was solid all the time; thereby eliminating the possibility that it might be a weather balloon.

Upon receiving the upper winds report giving us winds at 50 thousand feet of 4O miles per hour, and discovering that the chance of having a weather balloon would have been drifting that fast, and this object was stationary, we discounted the possibility of it being a weather balloon.  We were up from 3:30 till almost 5:00 searching this object.

The object appeared to have a tall or trailing fuselage type design.  It appeared to be oblong in shape, and it remained at all times probably stationary.

We discount the fact that it could have been a weather balloon due to the fact that the object was much too shiny. Weather balloons are coated dull with a powdery effect, so that they don't reflect the sunlight.  We have never seen a weather balloon that was that shiny as this object.

We kept the object in sight until approximately 5:42 at which time the object appeared to be increasing rapidly in speed. As our next circling of the object, it had completely disappeared.

There appeared to be no descent whatsoever to the object.

CAA USCG 2 POLK COUNTY FLORIDA
1.0 GENERAL
On 10 OCTOBER 57, at 0130 hours, TC-43 reported a UFO sighting approximately 6 miles SE of Bartow, Polk County, Florida. The observation was made by the TC-43 pilot and co-pilot while enroute from St. Petersburg to Jacksonville. The object was first observed at an elevation of approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and traveled approximately 5 miles in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 800 to 1000 knots. The object appeared to be round in shape and was described as a "bright bluish-green light, pulsating in intensity." After traveling 5 miles, the object accelerated sharply, climbed at a steep angle, and disappeared from view.
2.0 DISCUSSION
The report was carefully investigated by the ATIC project officer. All pertinent facts were obtained from the pilots, air traffic control personnel, and military radar stations in the vicinity. The pilots were determined to be reliable and their observation was considered credible.
3.0 CONCLUSION
Based on the data obtained, the TC-43 pilots' observation was classified as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
