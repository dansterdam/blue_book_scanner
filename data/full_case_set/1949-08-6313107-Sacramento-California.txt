INTELLIGENCE INTERROGATION

The following two (2) officers were interrogated 1 September 1949 as prescribed in letter, 0000, Hq AFTAC, dated 2 March 1949, Subject:
"Unconventional Aircraft," Part III.

[REDACTED] Mather Air Force

with duty assignment as [REDACTED] Mather Air Force Base

1. Q: What was the date of this sighting?  
   A: 31 August 1949

2. Q: What was the time of sighting?  
   A: 2217 hours.

3. Q: What was your position in relation to object sighted?  
   A: [REDACTED], Sacramento, California

   Q: What called your attention to the object?  
   A: We were identifying stars as practice and [REDACTED] saw the object first and told me and I saw it almost as soon as he told me.

4. Q: Any idea of your location in degrees?
   A: Longitude and latitude of position [REDACTED] 24 H.

5. Q: What was the number sighted?  
   A: One object was sighted. We both made a sketch or rough diagram.

6. Q: Do you think your sighting may have been a celestial phenomena?
   A: No, don't think so. We are both familiar with all unusual celestial appearances and are both [REDACTED]

7. Q: What was the distance from you to object sighted?
   A: I made a rough estimate of distance at about 15,000 feet.

8. Q: What was the altitude?
   A: [REDACTED] - I felt if it was lower than 15,000 and had been making noise, I would have heard it.  Any aircraft flying at that altitude if you weren't listening for it the noise would not be great enough to attract your attention. If there had been any sound, we could have guessed closer...

```
[UNCLASSIFIED]
Intelligence Interrogation (Contd)

If it had been an airplane, there would have been a rumble of contacting air behind it, but there was no noise. It was exceptionally large and if it had been lower, we might have been able to see any exhausts on it or some indication of a motor. Any object flying through the air like that is bound to make some noise. If we couldn't hear it, it must have been high.

7. Q: How long would you estimate it took to pass over you and out of sight?
A: 10 seconds but could have been a lot less than that. I think if I said about 5 seconds, it would be more accurate. I spotted it first and called [REDACTED]'s attention to it.
   I said about 30 seconds. It could have been a little longer but not 10 seconds.

8. Q: What was the appearance of object, color, shape, and construction and size?
A: To me it appeared to have a dull finish it wasn't white, an unpainted surface, like buffed metal you might say. (See inclosed sketch)
   It was dark, and I could see it against the sky. Had a dull reflection. It came over from Sacramento and went into the moonlight.

(See inclosed sketch)
Q: Do you both agree it was very large?
A: I compared it to a B-36 - large aircraft.
   I would compare it to the relative size of a C-54. It was definitely big.

9. Q: What was the direction of flight?
A: - I would say about 210°.
   - We agreed to within 10° as to the direction of flight.
     About 220° to 230°. We agred to about 230°.

10. Q: Did you observe any tactics or manuevers?
A: Just straight, level flight.

11. Q: Was there evidence of any exhaust?
A: Never saw any evidence of exhaust. There was no sound. There was another aircraft in the vicinity that may have cut out noises if there were any. However, don't believe another aircraft would have covered any noises but think we would have heard noises had there been any.

                no tail.  Flying wing type. Short nose. Very
                streamlined.
                - I got the impression that it had some sort of wings,
                some sort of tail and no sort of nose.
                
15. Q: How was the object propelled?
    A: No indication. First impression was that somebody was coming in
                for a dead stick landing but it was traveling too fast for that.
    
16. Q: Was there any visible exhaust, or jet opening.
    A: No.
   
17. Q: Was any fins or stabilizer controls visible?
    A: No.

    A: No, couldn't distinguish any.
    
19. Q: What was object's speed?
    A: ______ - I thought it was going about 600 or 700 miles per hour.
                My estimate is 700 or 800 miles per hour. Was traveling
                exceptionally fast. Estimate I saw it at an angle of
                10o and lost it at an angle of about 40o again. I 
                followed it a little further than _______. I first
                saw it near Polaris and lost it near the moon.
                - I judged the speed of the object according to the speed
                of other aircraft.
                
20. Q: Did object make any sound?
    A: No noise whatever.
    
21. Q: What was the manner of disappearance?
    A: It faded from view, blended in with the moon. Seemed to be
                going with moon and was lost in moon glow.
                
CONCLUDING STATEMENT OF CAPT _______ _______ and myself agreed we
wouldn't describe the object to each other and would make a report
separately. The only thing we did discuss was the direction as we wanted to
establish a definite direction.

STATEMENT

My name is [REDACTED] assigned to [REDACTED]
California. I live at [REDACTED] which is approximately five (5) miles due South of the center of Sacramento. Last night, 31 August 1949, at approximately 2200 hours, my neighbor, Lt. [REDACTED] also assigned to this base, called me and asked me to help him identify a particular star.

After doing this, we then proceeded to identify and locate various stars that were out. The night was clear, visibility unlimited. There was about a 3/4 moon. Apparently there was some haze because there was a bright area around the moon.

As we were looking at the Star Polaris, I had noticed an airplane flying a course of approximately due East at about 10,000 feet and I judged it to be slightly South or two (2) miles South of Sacramento. I could see its lights and hear its engine. Suddenly Lt. [REDACTED] punched me and said "look!" and almost at the same instant I saw what he was pointing to. I recorded my observations within twenty (20) minutes after this experience happened and I will give the facts as recorded.

This object first attracted my attention in the direction of Polaris. It was a dark shape against the sky. I believe that it had wings; it had no flapping or inner-motion. It made no sound before, during or after I saw it. I lost the object, after tracking it for approximately three (3) seconds, in the glow below the moon.

In other words, this object went from the direction of Polaris which is due North into the sky Southwest of the moon's direction, which at this time was Southwest, in approximately three (3) seconds. I recorded my feelings as follows: Large object, very fast, noiseless.

I had a definite uncanny weird sensation probably due to not knowing what I was looking at. I thought of a possibility of a shadow but this thing had body to it. It was hard to distinguish clearly but it blached out the stars under which it passed. I have no way of guessing its altitude but as a comparison of size, it appeared to be of the same relative size as a C-54 at 3 to 5,000 feet.

only things we discussed and agreed on were its course which was 2200

The photograph in the document is a drawing rather than an actual photograph. It depicts two views of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The first drawing shows a side view of the UFO and illustrates its boomerang or crescent-like shape with the text "Direction of flight" indicating its movement. Below this image is another drawing that appears to show the same object from a different perspective, labeled "Same angle of view" with an arrow pointing upwards towards the UFO. Below that is a sketch of a conventional airplane for comparison, shown in a side view from the ground with an arrow pointing upwards.

STATEMENT

My name is _______________, assigned to the _______________________, Mather Air Force Base, Mather Field, California. My duty assignment is ____________________.

My residence is at ____________ located approximately five (5) miles due south from the center of Sacramento, California. On 31 August 1949 about 2200 hours I called Captain__________ for assistance in identifying certain navigational stars.

The night was very clear, visibility unlimited. The moon was at a 3/4 phase with a bright area around it probably due to some haze in that area.

While looking at the star Polaris, I noticed a plane flying on an easterly heading approximately two (2) or three (3) miles south of Sacramento. The navigational lights of this airplane were clearly visible and the noise from the engines was very audible.

Watching the aircraft I suddenly touched___________ and said "Look" and pointed toward the sky just above the roof tops. Captain __________ saw it just about the time I pointed to it.

When I first spotted this object, it was just coming over the horizon. It made no noise; there was no visible motion of its very short, stubby wings. No noise or sound was heard as it came toward us and passed almost overhead. I lost sight of it just as it started into the moonlight.

This object came from a northerly direction, or from a direction of Polaris, the North Star. Its path of flight was straight and level and on an approximate heading of 230°. Its speed was estimated to be about 700 miles per hour. It was visible to me approximately five seconds. This was a very fast, very large missiles object.

This object was very visible as a dark object against the glow and reflection of the lights of Sacramento. It seemed to have a dull grey or silver finish which blended into the moonlight after it passed overhead.

The possibility of this being a shadow can be discounted because it did black out the stars above. I estimated its altitude to be about 15,000 feet. As a comparison the size of this object was larger than that of a B-36 at about 5,000 feet.

and I agreed not to describe this object in order not to influence each other's opinion. It did agree on th tg 2217, its direction of flight 220 to 230 and we sped 700 to 800 miles per hour. I also agreed that ------------- was to make the initial report and I would follow up with any additional information.

The psychological effect on me was a weird sensation best described as a hair raising experience. This object had size, shape and motion and not knowing what we were looking at in all probability gave me this strange feeling.

The shape of this thing is: short, rounded nose, very short wings rounded at tips, fuselage short and thick. There were no visible jets or exhaust openings and no visible indications of engines. There were no visible traces of jet or exhaust flames or smoke. There was no noise of any sort, no navigational lights or any other lights indicating its position or presence in the sky. Also in describing its shape, it had no tail surfaces that were visible.

The sketch attached to this statement is my impression of this object.
