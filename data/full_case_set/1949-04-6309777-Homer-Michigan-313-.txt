NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On the 25th day of April 1949 at 09:15 a.m I was sitting at my office at the
___, located in Homer, Michigan and while looking out of the window saw
strange objects in the sky which first appeared to be sea gulls. Quickly going
out doors and calling to a fellow worker, Mr. ___, who was working in
the tank room of the plant, we both were able to observe that they were not gulls
but six silver colored discs, rotating around in a wide circle at about a 45 degrees
angle and traveling the sky. They seemed to be revolving around as if they were
attached to an axel. I judged them to be between 300 and 1000 ft. off the ground
and travelling at about 100 miles per hour. After they had disappeared over the
tree tops I and another co-worker who had just on the had seen, jumped in
my car and pursued after them on Highway M-60. We traveled for about 3 1/2 miles west
of town, but were unable to locate them. After returning back to town, I called the
Jackson Citizen Patriot correspondent ___ and informed her of my
experience and then drove up town and informed ___ , editor of the local paper,

      FLYING DISCS IN STATE

                Special to the 
                Free Press

HOWELL, Mich.—William Sackett and Warren Gibson, employees of the Pet Milk Co., reported they sighted six flying discs over Howell about 9:15 p.m. Thursday.

They said they pursued them in an automobile for about five miles on U.S-16 before they lost sight of the low flying objects.

The men said the discs appeared to be about 10 inches in diameter, moving in wide circles, following a course which closely paralleled the highway.
