Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image:

8/12-9-52 2:25 A.M.
Subject: 2 red lights observed at 15-20 miles - appeared across the zenith in a southeast to northwest direction - at a high speed as a jet aircraft, but the lights were twice as bright and the lights were smaller than an aircraft. Believe they were just a flight of jets not spotted earlier. No sound heard. Became more of a general report of unusual sightings.
You told your cousin you saw again, - the lights - they now come and go - do you actually see them - or recall seeing them.  They you are convinced with time you saw nothing. After chances of being questioned, my opinion is that you actually saw a flight of jets not previously discovered, that is explained in a very simple way. There is no evidence to be preserved and nothing important as an incident which could be treated scientifically. This is merely one of many thousands of sightings - which have explanations - if more time is taken to investigate carefully.

Turned car a head south - peered through windows - heard 
a sound like a ball bearing rolling in a metal container - 
no one near by to cause this - this happened as we watched
the object - it appeared straight up - then changed direction
as movement - gave only the affect - not aminal - the
left light traveled - bend as if Broke away to the right-hand

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram showing the position of an object in the sky from two different perspectives - "A" when the object was first seen, and "B" when it was last seen. The sketch depicts the horizon and the object's position relative to the viewer.

The text instructs the viewer to draw a picture to show the motion of the object, indicating its path and position at the beginning and end of its movement. The viewer is also asked to draw a picture that shows the shape of the object and include any details or features that were observed.

23.  In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Apparently the object bore a narrow light or beam of light; course apparently changed somewhat as brightness diminished. 
75° Bearing - - east of north wss a disappearance of this light. 
Went into haze and noticed a hame-made telescope. Definitely saw two light -- could not tell whether they were ground or airborne. Turned towards north (?). One light (A) was about one-third the brightness of (B).

While observing the above phenomenon - came through a rift in the clouds and headed into the west.

At 20:12 still followed by (B) which had slowly diminished in brightness - about 3 degrees or 3 times the apparent size than (B). Shortly moved northeast of (A) - could definitely see the lights. On way moved out of sight of observer one light at a time disappearing or fading into the night. 

At 20:14 this fascinating object then gathered luminescence and moved in what appeared a straight line - the light rose up and went out, out of sight.
