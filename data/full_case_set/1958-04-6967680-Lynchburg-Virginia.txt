ORIGINAL REPORT (IRIS FILED WITH MR. RUPPELT DIVISION 19) 
REPORT OF 1 MAY 1958 (REF MESSAGE BY 20 JUN 58, 122.0615Z C&CV6)
REPORT OF 29 APR 1958 (REFERENCE BY 2OJU4 59, OOZ.)
The weather was good, with only scattered high scattered clouds. We were flying at 15,000'. This object appeared about 15 to 20 miles away on my left wing. It was about the size of my little finger held at arm's length (and slightly below it) at a distance estimated at 1000'. This object was a bright bluish-white light, seemingly static. It maintained that position and color and shape. It was estimated to be about 2 feet in diameter and was at 3 o'clock position from the plane wing. After maintaining this position for some time, it just faded out and was gone. It maintained about 900 mph and it was in sight for a little bit of gain seconds. It maintained about the same relative position all the time. This was falling lights: "MARGARET = DEM-", FIRST PATH.
