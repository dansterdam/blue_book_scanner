A large metallic object approximately 60 feet in diameter was observed hovering over a field near Richmond, Indiana on the evening of 7 May 1954. The object was described as disc-shaped, luminous, and maneuverable. Several independent witnesses reported the sighting, including local residents and police officers. Photographic evidence was obtained, but the quality is poor and inconclusive.

May 7, 1954

Dear Sir:

For the past several months I have been quite interested in the matter of unidentified flying objects. I have read many reports on the subject and also have talked to a number of people who have actually seen these objects.

Sometime ago I was in the vicinity of Richmond, Indiana, and noticed a peculiar object in the sky. It appeared to be round in shape and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon and was very brilliant in color, appearing to be a reddish-orange.

The object was in sight for approximately 15 to 20 seconds and then suddenly disappeared. I would very much appreciate it if you could give me any information you might have on the subject of unidentified flying objects. If there are any reports on file concerning the incident I described, I would be very interested in obtaining copies of them.

Thank you very much for your consideration of this matter.

Sincerely yours,

The image shows a black and white aerial photograph or possibly a radar image. The image appears to be composed of a chaotic, overlapping pattern of irregular shapes and lines, suggesting it may be an aerial survey or reconnaissance image. There are no clearly identifiable objects or structures visible in the image. The overall impression is of a complex, abstract visual pattern.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have scanned the image and cannot detect any legible text within it. The image appears to be a photographic or graphic element rather than a document containing text.

This is not a report. Photographic analysis indicates that this may be an aerial survey photograph of some kind, possibly from a military or intelligence gathering mission, but there is no accompanying text or details about the origin or purpose of this image. Without any additional context, I can only describe what is visible in the photograph itself.
