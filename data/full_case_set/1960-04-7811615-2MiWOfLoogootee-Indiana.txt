Between 0130 and 0200 (Zulu Time) on 6 April 1960, a civilian employee of NAD Crane, Loogootee, Indiana, and a member of the local police, CG-11 (Pay No. 1067), was driving east on Highway 50, about 2 miles from the Crane entrance, when he observed an object, circular in shape, approximately 40'-50' North Latitude and 87Â°-15' West Longitude. It flew towards the Crane area, did not appear to be any known type of aircraft, passed over the highway and behind a hill to the right.
