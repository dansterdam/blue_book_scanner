The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photographic image. 

Sound: Unspecified
Color: Unspecified

The shape of the object or objects is not clearly defined, as the drawing shows a vague, unclear depiction. There are no exhaust trails or vapor trails labeled in the sketch.

The edges of the object or objects are described as "Fuzzy or blurred".

There appears to be more than one object depicted in the sketch, as the question asks "IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?" and the drawing shows multiple indistinct shapes.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound 
b. Color

17. Draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

13. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
                  b. Like a spotlight after
                  c. Sharply outlined

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing written text to be filled out.

Project Blue Book: HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WAS SEEN. DESCRIBED AS BRIGHT OBJECT MOVING IN STRAIGHT LINE 
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or coin's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you held this comparison of the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS COMPARISON. THE OBJECT WAS TOO FAR AWAY AND TOO BRIGHT TO ESTIMATE ITS SIZE IN THIS MANNER.
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? I t SIMPLY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN A STRAIGHT UPWARD MOTION. 
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you saw.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WOULD GIVE SUCH AN APPEARANCE. IT WAS A BRIGHT OBJECT MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE UPWARD, UNLIKE ANYTHING I AM FAMILIAR WITH.

_____________________________________________________________________________

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I am not qualified to judge what I saw [my] impression is that it could have been a Aircraft of some unusual type & probably one in development or testing - its shape & motion were not like any aircraft I have seen before & I saw no wings or signs of propulsion although it did seem to be under control. My own opnion is that it was some kind of experimental Craft but I HAVE NO WAY TO REALLY BE CERTAIN WHAT IT WAS - I SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW AND THERE IS NO NEED TO SPECULATE FURTHER.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. Here is the text output from the document:

Dear Sir (s):

I am writing to you in a somewhat hesitant manner, as in the first paragraph of Project Blue Book files dealing with investigations of the type to which I refer, it states that I cannot be of any value to you.  I will give you my story, and leave that up to you.

On March 23, 1962, I had an experience, which I cannot adequately describe.  The day was clear, some clouds, but not the kind that would suggest an unusual phenomena.  At approximately 5:30 P.M. I observed two objects in the sky, and almost directly overhead.  They were shaped somewhat like a boomerang, and seemed to be maneuvering, their path was descending.  They could have been traveling South to North, or from West to East, I cannot say for sure.  The way we were facing, gave the illusion of going straight down, when actually they were moving in a northeast direction.

Their formation was approximately a 45 degree angle, and I'd estimate their distance from me to have been between 2-4 miles.  Their configuration was most intriguing, as when I first observed them, they appeared normal, and then as I kept my eyes on them, their formation was changing, almost as though they were turning or rotating.  This was definitely no aircraft as we know them.  Their rate of speed was phenomenal, and far exceeding any jet planes I have ever seen.  It was most impressive.

My wife's vision at distances is very good.  My vision is 20-20.  Both of us are reasonably intelligent, and not given to fantasies or superstitions, and are not even sure anyone else in Rochester or elsewhere even saw them.  We felt this was a very strange sight, and were wondering if you could give us any information on similar sightings in this area.  I believe I have covered our experience fairly accurately.  If you should desire to question me further, I would be glad to cooperate.  Why should we not be given the answer to the UFO's?

Thank you for your time.

Rochester, New Hampshire

The image contains three sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the trajectory of an object in the sky, with the text instructing the reader to place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches appear to be examples of how to complete the larger sketch, with one showing a more compact object and the other showing a more elongated object.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) where you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketches as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
