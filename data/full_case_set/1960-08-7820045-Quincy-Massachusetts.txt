UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Quincy, Mass.
Date (Local): 12 Aug 60
Hour (Local): 0155
Hour (2 Time Group): 0155

Satellites: (Det S ATIC, Ext 3279)

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): 

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): N/A

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc):

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Possibly

Other: from attractive imagination

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Undeclared

Analysis and Conclusions: The sky conditions were reported to be overcast. The object was described as a large, bright light, motionless and silent. It was witnessed by multiple observers, who estimated its size as a "good size", and its distance as 1 to 2 miles. The object was visible for approximately 10 minutes. No substantive information is available other than the description on the report itself, which in the opinion of the investigator provides insufficient data to determine the nature of the sighting. The case file is maintained pending further investigation or information which may assist in resolving this report.

Commanding Officer
Hanscom Air Force Base
Bedford, Massachusetts

Dear Sir:

This letter refers to the telephone call that you received on 12 August 1950, concerning a probable U.F.O. sighting over Quincy, Massachusetts area. Enclosed is a copy of the U.S. Technical Information Sheet, Form A.

Would you please forward this report to the Air Technical Intelligence Center. Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]

Air Technical Intelligence Center
Dear Sir:
Enclosed herein is a copy of the U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet, Form A.
This U.F.O. was sighted in 12 August 1950, at LRL's Air Installation, while observing the sky.
It was sighted by the following persons, while observing the sky:
7 persons: 
Both of the observers are considered to be air-lane, but their binoculars, which were being used to observe the object, suddenly became blurred and out of focus.
The object appeared to be about the size of a half dollar held at arm's length.
It did not observe any apparent sound.
The object was then viewed in a 3" x 4" telescope reflecting the same characteristics as in the binoculars.
It appeared and disappeared several times and finally disappeared completely, never to return.
The object's motion was that of abrupt starts and stops not having a steady rate of speed on the bottom started to revolve steadily, increasing in brightness and then the remaining portion of the object disappeared.
Lighted on the east end of the object, this lighted portion was distinct from the rest of the object and it appeared to indicate a structure or appendage on the east end of the object. This also disappeared.
And then the object gradually receded up and disappeared.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document reads:

"The object then began to increase in size as if approaching. It maintained its original shape throughout the observation. The movement was very slow, as if increasing in distance as time went by. The object remained in view for about 10 seconds and then appeared to diminish in size as if retiring in the distance. The color remained a steady glow, whitish in nature. The object showed no structural details as it increased in size and decreased again. Its movement was smooth and uniform, without any jerky or erratic motion. The object then disappeared from view, blending into the night sky.

I think there is an excellent possibility that I obtained a glimpse of an actual unidentified flying object, rather than any conventional aircraft. If it is the object with which I am familiar, it is of a remarkable nature and constitutes an important contribution to the field of UFO research.

I will not have the film developed, so that if you wish to see it, you will have to send for it, and enclose it in your envelope it yourself. It you need any other information, please let me know."
