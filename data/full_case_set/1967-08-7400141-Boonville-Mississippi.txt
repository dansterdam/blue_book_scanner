Dear Sir:

This letter is to report a mysterious sighting on 7 August 1967 near Boonville, Mississippi.

On the evening of 7 August, while traveling along Highway 78 near Boonville, Mississippi, my wife and I noticed a bright object in the sky. At first, we thought it was an airplane, but as it came closer we could see that it was not an airplane - it was a large, oval-shaped object, making no sound, and moving at a rapid speed.

The object seemed to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and it was emitting a bright, reddish-orange glow. It moved silently across the sky for several minutes, then made a sudden, 90-degree turn and sped off towards the northeast at an incredible speed.

My wife and I were quite shaken by what we saw, and we feel that this was no conventional aircraft. We would appreciate it if you could investigate this incident further.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
