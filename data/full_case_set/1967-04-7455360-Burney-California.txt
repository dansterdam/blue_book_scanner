PROJECT 10273 RECORD
2. LOCATION: Burney, California
10. CONCLUSION: Probable (AIRGRAD)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observe reported a glowing white object traveling toward the observer. The object was visible for about 10 minutes before slowly disappeared in the west. The object had height finder radar radar. The radar then reported back: The object disappeared and did not return.
COMMENTS: There seems to be no reason why the observation could not have been of a small airborne object. A small plane on VFR would probably have had a failed light pipe with the small plane visible with the 250 knote and would explain why the object was not returned by the radar.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing an observation of a moving object at an altitude of roughly 8000 feet near Lassen Peak.

Observations: The object was seen moving Northerly at an altitude of roughly 8000 feet, near Lassen peak. Close examination of a navigational map of the area revealed that the radar ray does come close to several points on the terrain, but the Moving-Target-Indicator operates to remove all nonmoving objects and should have had no difficulty in discerning the moving object. If it remained at an altitude of 8000 Feet, the observer would have seen it "rise" above the hills to the south, near Lake Almanor. 

The hills there have an altitude of 6000-7000 Feet. On a straight northerly course, the object would have been visible under ideal conditions until it passed over the hills just south of Klamath Falls. The southern range of hills is about 30 NM from the observer, the northern range about 50 NM from the observer to the north, and also about 20-30 NM from the Klamath Falls airport, the largest one within several hundred miles.

The object was within one hundred miles of this airport at the time the observer lost contact with it, and heading directly for the airport. This fact alone rules out the possibility of a truck being the object sighted, and close scrutiny of the map reveals no roads on which a truck might have been visible to the radar beam at the necessary altitude. The question is left open as to whether the radar will pick up a speed of 20 mph.

A talk with a friend who has had piloting experience revealed that it is entirely possible for an airplane to be flying at that altitude, at that time, in that weather, heading for the Klamath Falls airport. He suggested that the landing lights on some military craft are comparatively large, and could appear much larger due to diffraction as it passed through the snow.

Another look at the map showed that the object may have been visible over a 70-mile path under ideal conditions. The position-indicator radar fixed a point about 18 NM as the crow flies from the observer, who must have seen the object a few minutes before that.

Assuming a 20 NM visibility for the observer, the object covered 40 NM in 10 minutes, or 240 NM per hour, which is well within the range of twin-engine aircraft, and a small jet such as the T-38.

The report suggests that a small aircraft with its landing lights on flew over the path indicated at the time mentioned. Size of light caused by snow diffraction, lack or noise caused by observer sitting in car with engine running, or wind noise, or both; landing light may have been on due to emergency condition.

It may be possible to check with the Klamath Falls airport and ask them about any arrivals at this particular time.

ATTN OF: TDEER/Capt. F. C. Duplan/mjb/70401

SUBJECT: Unidentified Radar Returns - 19 April 1967

TO: TDET(Major Quintanilla)

1. From the information available it appears that:

a. Both search-and height finder radars were functioning properly.

b. Weather conditions were not likely to have supported extraordinary electro-magnetic refractions.

c. Visual observation was substantiated by radar.

2. The report indicates that a derelict balloon was shot down on the succeeding day; although no balloons were released in the proper time frame, this balloon should at least be considered. 

3. Weather conditions do appear to have been that which would tend to support a charged ice particle plasma. The plasma would be visible to both human eye and radar; the change color might have been a moon glow reflection as the incident occurred at 0410 hours.

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office has recently received several inquiries regarding the UFO sighting from Burney, California on 19 April 1967. As a result, we are re-investigating the case.

2. Request information on the specific type of radar on which the object was painted. What was the location and course of the object, if so, what were they? What is the period of time for an antenna rotation?

3. It has been proposed that the target which was picked up on your radars could possibly have been a truck. A map of the area indicated that there are mountains in this vicinity with elevations which could have caused the object to have been painted by the radars? If so, is this considered routine for your station?

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

A review of our records indicates that no balloon flight was launched on 18 April 1966. However, a balloon flight of 34.8 hours duration was launched on 13 April 1966, and was reported in the full 1966 issue of the Blue Book Summary. A balloon launched from Holloman AFB, New Mexico was in a northeasterly direction with termination performed near Washington, D.C. 15, 1966.

Case 4533
Dear Major Quintanilla:
I examined that the evaluation be changed from ionized plasma to unidentified since there is nothing in the data to support "a charged particle plasma". To the best of my knowledge, this does not correspond to a physically reasonable phenomenon. I, at least, do not know of any known physical plasma that is supposed to occur shortly and is visible for approximately 10 minutes. This appears to be a purely ad hoc explanation, and it open to the severest criticism.
Since this case has also been submitted to the University of Colorado, I suggest that Ir revises an evaluation from them.
Sincerely yours,

Dear Major:

I received a return the Burney, California case. I was not aware that this was a routine cover note for your case, but I was glad I received it. I would have made a xerox of it before bringing it with me to another meeting.

At any rate, I wrote to Mr. Ferguson, Shasta City Deputy Sheriff, to tell him that my air force officer friend would assist his for further investigation. (This is part of my regular plan.) I write to advise to go ahead and give whatever information the Deputy would like from us. If the Deputy will phone a collect call, we will be pleased to give any information available to us. 

The information had been related to us by a member of his staff in Burney, some considerable time ago. Very glad to know that this case has been forwarded to the Project Blue Book for further investigation. If this case results in any departure from the "standard" and accepted patterns, we will be most pleased to assist in any way we can with the Los Angeles group. Our observations have been rather carefully recorded and, so far as I know, have been submitted to the U.S. Air Force in their original form.

Thus, as you see, neither a good case, however, and our only chance of treating what this "little article" might be to check with the radar squadron in Budinger. Since I think it would be better if we placed a new call to them next time this I visit the Blue Book.

If anything further develops on this case, I would be pleased to receive the information. "The Information Cry" case, but I was aware, has been returned. As far as I know, I do not have any records concerning it. No additional copies of reports, etc., have been submitted with the original copies, should there be any. 

I am still interested that to a further investigation was made of the Burney case. If this case results in anything that would relate to the subject, I will most glad receive the information.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

But to get to the point, this does not concern me directly. My concern is in the contract. I can find nothing in the contract to cover the situation where I find myself obliged to event "looking under the bed" techniques. I will depend upon counsel to determine how much latitude I have in that respect, no matter what the work, whatever it may be.

Dear Mr. Wint,

Your letter of April 9th, which contained information concerning the alleged UFO sighting in the Burney, California area on the evening of April 7th, has been received and carefully reviewed. This office has a long-standing policy of thoroughly investigating all bona fide reports of unidentified aerial phenomena which are submitted to it. However, in the present case, the information provided is quite sketchy and incomplete. No details are given as to the specific nature of the sighting, the number and appearance of the objects observed, their apparent size, altitude, direction of flight, duration of observation, or the identity and background of the observer(s). Without these essential details, it is impossible for us to conduct a meaningful investigation or to make any definitive assessment of the situation. 

I would be most grateful if you could provide me with a more comprehensive and detailed report of this incident at your earliest convenience. Any drawings, photographs, or other physical evidence that may be available would also be extremely helpful. Upon receipt of such additional information, I will be glad to initiate a thorough inquiry into this matter.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

Attn: 2LT/LT. Wise

1. Reference is to 19 April 1957 radar paint of an unidentified flying object which was reported to the Air Force through Adaic ARS, Oregon. The initial sighting was reported to consist of two objects made by both visual and radar sighters.

In determining if the visual observation and radar paint were of the same object, it is necessary for additional information, distance, and height.
Information are requested if available.

2. At present, it does not appear that the two unidentified objects were related. Adverse weather conditions at the time of the sighting would imply that the object visually observed would have been quite low in the sky.

Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, 45433

Through: Chief, Airways Facilities Branch(SFO-404)

On 19 April 67 at 1210GMT, I received a call from the Flight Service Specialist on duty at the Red Bluff Airport, requesting information on an object in the sky over the airport. He advised and I confirmed that the Sheriff had called with a report of an object and he was concerned as to its being a possible hazard to air navigation.

I confirmed an object being at 32 degrees Mag and 48 Nautical Miles. The Radar contact was 3200 feet MIT Vidoe. This would indicate the object had some movement to it.

I then called the Air Force Flight Section and requested the altitude of the object, if they had it on their Height Finding Radar. The operator advised that the object was moving vertically above and below that altitude by 200 ft.

I relayed the information to the Flight Services Specialist at the Airport and advised him of the Oakland ARTCC.

The Flight Service Specialist advised that the Sheriff estimated the altitude of the object to be 5000 ft above him and that his location was near 5000 ft.

At the time of the sighting the Radar showed that the worst part of the storm was passing, but the sighting area was of little or no weather. The target area at the time of the sighting was on the radar would indicate the object to be smaller than most air-liners, but this could be deceiving due to the characteristics of the UFO system. The target quality was such that it lasted for 3/4 of an hour.

I hope this information is what you desire and can be of some use to you.
