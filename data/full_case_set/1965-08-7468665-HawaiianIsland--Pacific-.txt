The document appears to be a report form for a UFO sighting that occurred on 4 August 1965 in the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific region. The report indicates that a single object was observed, which was likely an Atlas missile launched from Vandenberg prior to the sighting. The object was observed visually from the ground and air, traveling at a high speed of around 20,000 ft/s. No photographs or physical evidence were obtained.

1. According to a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaiian area, 2 August to 5 August 1965, five UFOs were reported. One of them (PART D) received widespread publicity in Hawaii resulting in increased reporting and public reaction.

a. On 3 August, 06002 (3/2000 local) a family living in Wailuku, Maui at high altitudes and on various headings saw five lights approaching from the northeast. The lights appeared to be hovering, some stationary, some moving and descending. They could observe the sky from a position approximately 7 miles from the city. It was raining slightly. No one else reported the lights, even though they reportedly were visible for some time.

b. On 4 August, 06442 (3/2044 local) numerous sightings were made of an object which fell from the sky southwestward. The reports differed on the object's direction and altitude. It was described as round, disc-shaped, and on some occasions it appeared to be two objects. All witnesses stated it was flying at 31,000' on the 290Â° radial 180 mi out of Honolulu VORTAC. It was bright enough to illuminate the cockpit as it fell to the north, but some pilots believed there was actually two separate lights operating together in what seemed to be a unitary vehicle. The two pilots tried to track it like a ground sighting. Our investigation shows this was likely a meteor or atmospheric phenomena and it is unlikely that it was a space vehicle, although analysis continues.

OCR text output:

ON 4 AUGUST AT 12320Z (APPROXIMATELY) THE CREW OF A TAC C-130 AIRCRAFT REPORTED THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED AN OBJECT IN THE AIR WHILE PRACTICING INSTRUMENT APPROACH TO KAHULUI AIRPORT, MAUI, HAWAIIAN ISLANDS AT 2290. LOCATION OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS 125 W TO 128 W MILES OFFSHORE.

(1) OCEAN STATION NOVEMBER SIGHTED THE SAME OB-JECT AND REPORTED THAT IT LIFTED UP THE WHOLE SKY AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD.

(2) INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY AN ALIAS CASSEGRAINIAN TELESCOPE (A TYPE USED IN MILITARY BY COMMAND FIGHTER FIRE CONTROL OPTICS). THE FLASH FROM FUEL STILL LEFT IN THE BOOSTER ON SEPARATION RESEMBLED THAT OF THE MAIN FIRING WAS 13 MINUTES LONGER THAN THE SIGHTING REPORTED BY THE AIRCRAFT. HOW-EVER, THE INTERVENING REPORTS BY THE AIRCRAFT ON-STRUCTION OF THE OBJECT, INCLUDING THAT THE OBJECT SEEMED TO INCREASE IN SIZE, IS IN FACT ONE AND THE SAME.

ON 5 AUGUST AT 14572, REPORTED A ROCKET FIRING FROM THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN. THE OBJECT CLIMBED RAPIDLY AND FLEW INTO THE CLOUDS ON HEADING 0495. ONE AIRCRAFT ALSO REPORTED A SIGHTING OF THREE LIGHTS WHICH TRAVELED AT GREAT SPEED ACROSS THE LAUNCH AREA.

(1) A QUERY TO CINCPACFLT OPS PLOT REVEALED THAT THE SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY DUE TO A NAVY OPERATION BEING CONDUCTED IN THAT AREA AT THAT TIME.

ALSO ON 5 AUGUST AT 0500Z, A TEENAGER REPORTED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY. SINCE NO OTHER DETAILS WERE AVAILABLE AND NO CONCLUSION COULD BE DRAWN, THE SIGHTING WAS RULED NON-SIGNIFICANT AND NO INVESTIGATION WAS MADE.
