NAME: [Redacted]

DATE: 5 AUG 1955

I was vacationing in Europe, and the plane I was on had a very unusual experience. We were flying from Estrasburgo through the Hietym Hotel in Madridejos, arriving a little late since the weather was bad. When we landed, a German businessman, Dr. [Redacted], was also on the airplane. He remarked to me that while we were in the air, he noticed a large, bright, metallic object that seemed to pace us for a while. He said it was cigar-shaped, with what appeared to be openings or lights on the side, and it moved at a tremendous speed, much faster than our plane. The object disappeared in the direction of the west. Dr. [Redacted] was quite startled by the experience and felt that perhaps he had seen some kind of experimental aircraft. I was inclined to believe his report, since he seemed to be a serious and responsible person. I hope this information is useful to your investigation.

This must, I must insist, all been the work of some flying, or some kind of reasearch: That is what, as stated, But as a matter of fact to conclude all that there were several observations, one of an "object" quite unusual:
  On that occasion, I succeeded in taking a few notes, and I am convinced that the facts I have been stated correspond in a large measure with what proved to be the truth.
The night was fairly clear, and the atmosphere was calm: At the time, I happened to be a witness of something that caused me considerable surprise and interest.
At about 10:30 p.m. I was standing in a garden adjoining my home, and happened to glance upwards in the sky. To my astonishment, I observed, at an altitude I estimate to be perhaps 1500 meters or more, a kind of oval-shaped "object" seemingly suspended motionless in the air.
Needless to say, I was greatly intrigued by this sight, and I carefully observed the "object" for a period of some 15 to 20 minutes. During this time, it remained absolutely motionless, and did not seem to change either in size or shape. It was illuminated by a faint luminous glow, and appeared to be of considerable size, perhaps 30 to 40 feet in diameter. I would say that its general outline was that of a flattened ellipse.
The night was clear and moonlit, and there were no clouds in the sky at the time, so vision conditions were ideal. I can say with certainty that what I saw was not a star, meteor, or any other known celestial body. Nor was it an aircraft of any type that I am familiar with.
In fact, I must confess that I am completely baffled as to the nature and identity of this strange "object". I can only say that it gave me the impression of being a solid, metallic-looking structure, suspended motionless in the air. After observing it for the period mentioned, it suddenly and without warning, simply disappeared from sight, as if it had been switched off. There was no noise, no trail, and no sign of its departure.
Needless to say, I was greatly intrigued and puzzled by this experience, and I have thought about it a great deal since then. However, I have been unable to arrive at any satisfactory explanation. I can only conclude that what I saw was some kind of unusual aerial phenomena, the nature of which I am simply unable to determine.
I should add that there were no other witnesses to this incident, as far as I know. I was the only person who happened to observe this strange "object" on that particular occasion.
I trust that the foregoing account of my experience may be of some interest to you, and I would be glad to furnish any additional details that you may require. Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions.

APPENDUM

Dr. Condon has reviewed this report and considers the information for the case not sufficient for a conclusion. We have, however, made a decision that this case must be investigated further, and we are requesting another investigative report for this case.

It is seen that the witness overstated his case. Although he certainly saw something, the description he gave was apparently exaggerated and more colourful than the actual observations, as is sometimes the case with such witnesses. While the witness was certainly sincere, he appears to have embellished his story to some degree. Nevertheless, the core of his account, that he did observe an unidentified object, is valid and deserves further investigation.

It is essential that we try to ascertain what it is the witness actually saw. If his description was indeed exaggerated, we need to get at the basic facts of the sighting. We also need to explore alternative explanations that may fit the true facts of the case. Apparently some aspects of the witness's account are questionable, and we need to sort out the genuine observations from the embellishments.

Photography would be a valuable aid, if such photographs are available. We urge that the witness be interviewed again to try to get a clearer picture of exactly what he observed. Any additional data that can be obtained, such as weather reports, sightings by others, etc., should also be gathered.

II. Dr. --- was in the U.S. Navy during W.W.II. He became very interested in U.F.O.'s because of his naval background. Unfortunately, he had some health problems which prevented him from actively pursuing his interest in U.F.O.'s in recent years. However, he still maintains a keen interest in the subject.

Photo will be mailed as soon as available.

II. RELIABILITY: Good. In a personal interview SOURCE seemed reliable and the information offered appears to be a factual record of his observations.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On 23 June 1955, at the CASTELLANA HILTON HOTEL in MADRID, SPAIN, at the time of the observing (between 9:30 and 11:00 PM) SOURCE witnessed the following:
Object appeared to be saucer-shaped, somewhat larger than the standard aircraft, and was observed for an estimated period of two (2) minutes. The single object appeared to be black and became chocolate colored as it reflected the light of the setting sun. It hovered over the hotel at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet.
Source observed the object to descend steadily at a uniform rate and then rise again at the same rate, without any apparent indication of motive power. The object traveled in a horizontal course without gyrations. Source had the impression that the object was under intelligent control.

IV. SOURCE'S OPINION: 
SFRGS has no opinion of what the object could be but is definite that it is not a known type of aircraft, weather balloon, meteor, or astronomical phenomenon. He is at a loss to account for what he observed.

V. CONCLUSION:
The source observed what he contends was a small, saucer-shaped object maneuvering and hovering above the Castellana Hilton Hotel between 9:30 and 11:00 PM on 23 June 1955. Duration of sighting was approximately two (2) minutes.

From: "Flying Saucer" information:

Dear sirs:
Another Long Beach, Calif. physician & myself are vacationing in Europe for the month of June and July. Yesterday, July 13, we observed a formation of 9 bright objects, white in color, flying in echelon formation at a tremendous speed. They flashed on the clear sky, were above us for a few seconds, and disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared. There were no vapor trails and no sound. The objects appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length. In my opinion they were at an altitude of approximately 60,000 feet or more. I was looking on the open sun porch adjoining our room on the top floor of this hotel. My companion was also watching them from the rear window of the building. We have seen many unusual aerial phenomena before but never anything quite like this. There were no other known aerial devices in the sky at the time. The sky was almost perfectly clear, with only a few small clouds. There were no reflections or mirages. The objects moved in perfect formation and at a speed which would indicate tremendous propulsion power. I estimate their speed to be somewhere between 3 and 5 thousand miles per hour.

I do not know whether you are as all interested in this subject as I am. In view of the fact that this is the third time I have reported unusual aerial phenomena and in view of the seeming increase in these occurrences, I am anxious to establish direct contact with any person or persons who may be able to evaluate these reports properly. If there is a published journal or periodical devoted to this subject, I should be grateful to have the name and address so that I may subscribe. Perhaps you may be able to suggest some other constructive way in which I can assist in obtaining further data on this most fascinating and important problem. Should you be interested in a photograph of the objects, please write to me at the address below.

Sincerely,
Long Beach, California

While vacationing in Madrid, Spain, I had a very unusual experience. I was sitting in the open-air patio adjoining our room at the Castellana Hilton Hotel. It was about 10:30 PM on the evening of 23 July 1955. Suddenly, I observed a brilliantly illuminated object which appeared to be at a considerable distance in the sky somewhat to the northeast of our position. At first, I thought it was an aircraft, but as I continued to watch the object, I noticed that it was swaying back and forth in a smooth, undulating motion, and no aircraft sounds could be heard. The object was intense white in color, and appeared to be larger than any conventional aircraft. It remained visible for approximately two to three minutes, after which it simply disappeared. I also noticed a smaller, brilliant reddish-orange object just below the larger white object. This smaller object seemed to pulsate or throb in brightness, and it too eventually disappeared. 
I was greatly impressed by this observation, which I first interpreted as a huge saucer-shaped craft of some kind. However, as the seconds passed, I began to realize that what I had observed did not fit the usual description of a "flying saucer" as we know them. Whatever the nature of this object, it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I have no idea what it could have been, but I am convinced that it was not an aircraft, as we normally envision them.
Automatically, I kept trying to eliminate all possibilities that could explain the brilliant object. The night was clear, and the stars were shining brightly in the 
dark sky. Unless some unknown aircraft had landed and was sitting still, which seems most unlikely, I am at a loss to account for what I saw. This was no meteor or any other known celestial phenomenon. Whatever it was, it defied all explanations within my present knowledge. 
As the object faded away, I continued to strain my eyes in the hope that it might reappear, but it did not. I have searched the Air Force Technical Intelligence Center card file and have been unable to find anything that even remotely resembles the object I saw.
I. Dr. James has reviewed this report and concurs with all opinions expressed. His answer to question #22 follows:
Well, as to the most difficult question that you have asked, is that this, of course, to gain height as arms length defines the size to the sky. If held in a window, looks large; if held at arms length, looks quite small. This of course introduces an element of uncertainty as to the actual size and the actual distance of the object. I can only hope that the photographic evidence, when and if it should come, will help resolve this problem. The phenomenon that you have described, however, is intriguing and calls for further investigation.

II. Dr. Ellis was in the U.S. Navy during W.W. II at a location where launching of large balloons had been carried on from that area. He is familiar with their appearance and is convinced that the unidentified object was not any type of balloon that he has ever seen.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the preparing officer, the reliability of the observation and conclusions presented herein is limited due to the following:
a. The observers were not asked to submit separate statements because they were not the same persons whose observations were submitted as 2 a.
b. The observers were not asked to submit reports separately because their observations were essentially the same except for a small difference in size of the object.
2. The photo-evaluation study may alter this opinion. (Inclosure: /1/, Part One,)
a. The only possible explanation could be an aircraft, The object was flying low would not be distinguishable.
3. The time duration was in line with an aircraft sighting.
SCORES TO BE EXACT ALTITUDE NOT DEFINITE, THEREFORE, THE GREAT SPEED REPORTED BY THE OBSERVERS COULD BE EXPLAINED BY A LOW FLYING JET AIRCRAFT

During a tour of the city of Madrid on the night of July 10, 1955, at about 10:30 PM, my wife and I along with several others observed a very strange aerial object. This craft was about 15 to 20 feet in diameter, had a bright whitish glow that illuminated the area, and traveled silently across the night sky from west to east. It first appeared in the bright western sky, passed directly over Madrid, and disappeared to the east. It took about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes for the object to cross the sky. Since the sky was unusually clear, we were able to observe the object very closely. It seemed to be entirely self-illuminated, and no navigation or running lights were visible. The glow appeared to be coming from the body of the craft itself. Its speed was phenomenal, unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. 

No sounds were heard, and the object seemed to be under intelligent control. I only wish I had been able to photograph this strange visit. If you have any information on similar sightings, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Sincerely,
D. Milton Hill

22.1. (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.)
a. Certain b. Pretty sure c. Just a guess

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
Gradually fading from view over a period of about 15 seconds. The object was observed by two persons and was obscured by haze or thin cloud.

24. In order that you can give us clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you would draw or paint a picture of the object. Please give your ideas as to the shape, color, and any other details of the object which you saw, even though your sketch or painting would not be to scale and might not be technically accurate.

The object was circular or disc-shaped, metallic or silvery in appearance, reflecting the sun's rays, and was maneuvering at slow speed, at high altitude. Within such an object, one could imagine control panels, instrumentation for navigation, and perhaps even living quarters, for a crew of perhaps, say, two persons. The object gave the impression of poise and controlled power, rather than a mere mechanical contrivance. If such an object exists, it must represent a very high order of technological achievement, well in advance of our present capabilities. The fact that the object so easily vanished from sight leads one to speculate as to the possible existence of means of propulsion and control far superior to any known aircraft or spacecraft. This possibility, if substantiated, would represent a significant advance in man's knowledge of the universe and the laws which govern it, and should be the subject of the most serious and unbiased scientific investigation.
