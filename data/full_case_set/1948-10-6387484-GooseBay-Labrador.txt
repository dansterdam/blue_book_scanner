1. Reference is made to incoming messages 291600Z, 011930Z,
012025Z, and 022025Z from AAF Goose Bay, Labrador, reporting several
radar sightings of unidentified aerial objects. It is suggested
some Base Intelligence Officer be directed to initiate an immediate
investigation of the reported sightings.

2. Pertinent information relative to the reported objects is
desired as follows:

      a.  Was object apparently practicing radar evasive tactics
when it disappeared from the scope periodically, or was it running
into normal or skip "null" zones affecting appearances of all aircraft?

Five copies of Essential Elements of Information form are attached
as an aid to the interviewing officer in obtaining the desired inform-
ation.

DECLASSIFIED ON 2nd lnd

TO: CG, Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base, Dayton, Ohio. ATTENTION: MCIAKX-3.

1. In compliance with basic letter, this attached re-
ports are submitted.

2. Message 291600Z continuued three (3) sightings, which
were intended separately and are listed as inclosures "1,"
"2" and "3". Message 031502 contains no instructions on where
to route UFO sightings if called at this station, or the
message 010425Z. It is believed that this number is in
error. Message 031501Z, which was initiated by the
1932nd AACS Sq., and addressed to the headquarters, was
probably dislayed in Message Control and this date to map group
changed to 022005Z. This message referred to a sighting
at 2145Z on 1 November 1948.

3. Our message 021515Z, referred to above, could not
be placed on a message, due to the scope of the message tape
being clogged.

a. By plotting a point three and three quarters
(3 3/4) miles from the station on a bearing of one hundred
and twenty-three degrees (123°) and following a flight path
on a heading of two hundred and forty-nine degrees (249°)
for a distance of severn and one half (7 1/2) miles when the
message states the object disappeared, would not put the
object's disappearing point one hundred and eighty-two de-
grees (182°) from the station.

b. This same message stated that the object tra-
veled the distance of four (4) miles in four (4) minutes
and seven (7) seconds timed by a stop watch. If this were
true, the object could not have disappeared from view and
one half (1 1/2) miles scope on which it was sighted, neither
could it, large, disappeared at on, hundred and eighty-two
(182°) degrees from this station, assuming there it did travel
on a heading of two hundred and forty-nine degrees (249°) as
stated.

Note: Some words were uncertain due to the quality of the text in the image, such as "MPIS" which might be "MPH" (miles per hour), "ICAF" which could refer to a military or civil air command (often it's USAF for United States Air Force), "PPI" referring possibly to Plan Position Indicator, and "Rawin" likely referring to a type of upper-atmosphere weather observation method or equipment.

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, CMAC-4 dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," with endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' numbers 173 through 233 have been screened against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and horizontal motions are distinguished if possible, and that motion is specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move. "Relative to Radar Spottings" should include a statement of the type of radar set used.

M/Sgt Francis H. Mills, AF 16134800
1932 AACS Sq. Goose Bay Labrador, APO 677. N. Y.
CCA Operator

Eyes(s): Good ability to determine color and speed of moving objects and good ability to determine size at distance. Reliability good. Character & intelligence: excellent

Target picked up on GCA scope at 2151Z 1 Nov at 
3-3/4 miles from station on a bearing of 212° from station. Object travelled on a heading of approximately 212° and disappeared at 7-1/2 miles on a bearing of 182° from the station. Blip travelled the 4 miles in 4 minutes and 7 seconds timed with a stop watch. (A speed of approximately 60 mph) Operators stated blip was too small at 7-1/2 miles to be an aircraft and too large to be a bird. Wind was from 270° to 300° and at 5 to 10 mph. Target witnessed by 2 CAA Operators.

Discrepancy reported: 2d Ind dated 24 Jan 1949 from ?/Hq 1272d Air Base Gp, Newfoundland Base Command, MAPS, para 3a & 3b states that 

"By plotting a point 3 and 3/4 miles from the station on a bearing of 212° and following a flight path on a heading of 212° for a distance of 7-1/2 miles where the object disappeared would not put the object's disappearing point 182° from the station.

This same message stated that the object travelled the distance of 4 miles in 4 minutes and 7 seconds timed by a stop watch. If this were true, the object could not have disappeared from view and off the mil scope on which it was sighted; neither could it have disappeared at one hundred and eighty-two degrees from the station assuming that it did travel on a bearing of 212° as stated."
