peculiar objects in the sky over Bakersfield, predicated an investigation by their office and contacts with Headquarters Fourth Air Force.

On 13 March 1948, two informants, Mr. ****************, and Mr.
********** stated that they observed a flying object which appeared to
go consumed in fire, and left a brownish, white plume of smoke, which
suddenly stopped and disappeared. Seconds later, what appeared to be
a parachute, was seen to be drifting to the east.

The object, as described, appeared to be a burning fabric airplane,
consumed in smoke. Observations were made in Bakersfield of object to
the south and southwest, approximately ten to twelve miles distance,
around 1600 hours on 5 March 1948.

On 13 March 1948, informants, Mr. ********** stated that he observed
an object at 0830, 8 March 1948, due north of Bakersfield, approximately
five miles distance. The object was a large, orange-red ball of fire,
somewhat larger than a small airplane, appeared to remain static for
approximately thirty seconds, then split and continued to burn; each
visible as a burning ball, a parachute, with a black object hanging

hills east of Bakersfield.

were in ********* Haberfelde Building, on the morning of 9 March 1948.
*** ********* was a patient of Dr. ******** Both informants stated that

able black smoke trailing in a straight manner for approximately 4,000 to
5,000 feet. The object was observed at 1,000 feet, approximately due
north of Bakersfield, seven to ten miles distant at approximately 0830

The photograph in question appears to be a black and white image of a page from a document. The top portion of the document includes two paper fasteners and there's a shadow indicating the bend of the paper. The text and markings on the document are partially obscured by what appears to be censoring marks (likely black marker or redaction bars) covering sensitive information.
