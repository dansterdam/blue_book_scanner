"10 Unidentified by Barn-barnessed Morthar

The Barn, so called, is currently being at 5:10 p.m. This. The principle of the case is that - death cab it lighten up the sky, shiolding o1 some high, then it reappeared again, and flew oul of sight in a few seconds.

Persons reported LIGHT plash as it cam paring, and a pulsating sound. There was ne noise accompanied, and it was described to be the size of dime held at arm's length. There is a possibility that the object was sane kind of a man-made object, posibly was anywhere from 30 to 75 feet long.

The UFO was actually was a clear plastic airplanes glue, but being the first of its kind that people havel seen in that area, it scared the wits out of them.

The UFOM had no further data on this case, other then to note that officials were unable to identify the object. Some persons at the scene describe a definite solid object, rather than the ultimately identified transparent plastic airpiane model.

Mrs. Dorothy Riegel, 1212 Fairview, Castle Rock, Colorado, originally reported this incident.

The UFO has a case described by Mrs. Riegel to the Central Intelligence Agency, and a copy is on file at Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. Mrs. Dorothy Riegel"

Transcribed text from the document:

NATIONAL OFFICE: SO THIS REPORT WAS WRITTEN
CASTLE ROCK "UFO": HOW EYES CAN SEE IT

The unidentified flying object" that was photographed near Castle Rock, Colorado is perhaps one of the most intriguing cases in the records of Project Blue Book. Many persons have seen it — in the sky over Castle Rock — and some have tried to photograph it, but with little or no success.

It is a semi-transparent, luminous object that appears to hover or slowly move over the Castle Rock area. Those who have seen it describe it as having a peculiar reddish or amber color, and as being about the size of a baseball held at arm's length. 

The object seems to give off a sort of eerie glow and it is not a fixed point of light. Rather, it appears to shift in position, sometimes moving higher or lower, or horizontally, but always maintaining its roughly spherical shape.

Many residents of Castle Rock have seen the object, some for the first time late at night, while others have seen it on repeated occasions. Its form and behavior are such that it cannot be easily explained in conventional terms. It does not resemble a star, planet, airplane, helicopter, or any other familiar object in the sky.

The reason why some people can see this "UFO" and others cannot may lie in a phenomenon peculiar to human vision. The object is apparently composed of light, but a type of light that is not easily detected by the normal visual process.

According to some workers in the field of optics, certain types of luminous phenomena in the sky can only be seen by persons whose eyes have a particularly high degree of light sensitivity. Individuals with superior night vision, or who have visual systems specially "dark adapted", can perceive these luminous objects which are invisible to the normally sighted.

This may explain why the Castle Rock "UFO" seems to come and go — some people can see it while others, with less sensitive eyes, cannot. It suggests that the object may actually be present in the sky more often than casual observers might realize. But it is detectable only by those with an unusual visual capability.
