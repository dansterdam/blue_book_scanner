Dear sirs:
An unidentified flying object was sighted October 1, 1964 at approximately 9:00 P.M. about 1 mile west of Hillsboro, Oregon. The object was reported to be about 15 to 20 feet long, oval in shape, and was floating about 300 feet off the ground. It gave off a bright orange glow and was observed for several minutes before disappearing over the hills. No sound was heard. The weather was clear with no wind at the time.
