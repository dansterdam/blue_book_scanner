                                   UNCLASSIFIED           30 November 1948

At approximately 1430 hours on Wednesday, 17 November 1948, we the
undersigned were playing tennis during our squadron allotted time for such
physical training and observed the following described phenomena in the
atmosphere. The description following is only fully agreed on by both parties
who saw phenomena necessary to either party to believe that what is herein
described is the most accurate description possible under the existing
circumstances.

According to Lit Hq., 13th Air Force, AG 452.1, Subject: Unidentified
Aircraft or Flying Objects, our report is:

a. Over the Eastern edge of Clark Air Force Base at 1430 hours,
17 November 1948, a phenomena in the sky was sighted.

b. The weather was clear, the sky was blue with slight stratus
clouds on the eastern horizon. (See Inclosure 3)

c. 1st Lt.  ██████████ and 1st Lt. ██████████,
             44th Fighter Squadron (SQ), 18th
             Fighter Group (Gp.), APO 74, USAFFIP, were witnesses.

d. No photographs were available as the phenomena only lasted
about three minutes before its vapor substance such as smoke
was scattered widely throughout the atmosphere.

e. A sketch is attached, (See Inclosure 1 and 2)

f. This phenomena was singular and appeared to be at an altitude
of approximately 30,000 feet at a heading of either 120 degrees
or 300 degrees according to its origin (if that of an aircraft)
and no sound was made by it. It was white in color and appeared
to be an exhaust trail which had a sudden bursting end and then
tapered off to nothing.

g. It is firmly believed not to be a cloud because of its shape
and the surrounding weather which in its vicinity was a cloudless
sky. Both parties remarked nearly together that it appeared as
if an aircraft had exploded and left its white smoke column. It
dissipated in approximately three (3) minutes.

The redacted sections are blocks of black where personal names and possibly classification markings have been obscured.

The image shown does not contain a photograph but rather appears to be a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch looks like a spiral or twisting column of smoke leading up to a cloud-like structure at the top. There are no other discernible features or context provided by the drawing.

The text in the document reads as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

[drawing of a twisting column with a cloud-like structure on top]

UNCLASSIFIED

[several stamps and marks, likely administrative or classification labels, that are not eligible or clearly relevant to the content of the report for OCR purposes]

- page 8 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but it does include a number of hand-drawn sketches and annotations that appear to be related to a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). Given the context, it seems to be part of a military report from Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of UFOs conducted by the United States Air Force.

The sketches seem to represent several views of the UFO and the flight path or maneuvers made by the objects. There are also some characters and text, but due to the quality of the scan and the orientation of the text, it's challenging for me to perform an accurate OCR function and reproduce the text.

If you require the text to be transcribed or have specific questions about any details in the image that might be discernable such as shapes, directions indicated by the arrows, or the context of some of the annotations, please let me know, and I will do my best to provide you with that information.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #203 — Clark AF Base, Phillipine Islands — 17 November 1948

The limited information in the description of this incident 
can be explained as refering to the trail and explosion smoke left
by a Fireball. The white exhaust trail extending some one to ten miles,
the "Flak-like" terminal burst, the estimated altitude, and the color
and tl.e in sight all concur in ascribing this sighting to a Fireball.
The time of day of the observation is also in agreement.

Incident: 208

The object sighted by the two fighter pilots had the appearance
of a flak burst sitting still in the atmosphere and was connected
to a curved trail of corkscrew appearance (See drawing attached)
The trail was from 1 to 10 miles in length and did not have the
appearance of a vapor trail but rather that of a rocket or jet
exhaust. Altitude was judged to be 30,000 ft. The mass and trail
disappeared within approximately three minutes. The mass appeared
white in color like an exhaust trail which had a sudden burst
origin and then tapered off to nothing. Both parties remarked that
it appeared as if an aircraft had exploded and left a white smoke
column. The vapor substance dissipated in approximately 3 minutes
scattering thinly like smoke through the atmosphere. It is firmly
believed by both witnesses that the object was not a cloud because
of its shape and because the sky in the vicinity was cloudless.

Evaluation: C-3
