Transcription of the text in the document:

Guam (Truk Island)   6 February 1953

I. Description of Incident:
At 1110 local time an Air Force officer in charge of the Weather Bureau Station on Truk sighted an unidentified bullet-shaped shiny object travelling at an estimated 150 mph at an approximate altitude of 100 to 500 feet. This object appeared to be slightly larger than a C-47 aircraft and was travelling with an easily noticeable velocity. It did not disclose any trail, smoke or tail indication, and gave a shiny appearance as if of metallic construction.

II. Discussion of Incident:
A check with Guam Flight Service indicates that a C-47 was in the area at the time of sighting. The day was clear with a bright sun, capable of disturbing the normal features of a C-47.

III. Conclusion:
Probably aircraft.
