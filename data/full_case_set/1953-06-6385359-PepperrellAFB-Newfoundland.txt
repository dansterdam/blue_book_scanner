It appeared to be traveling in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 200-300 knots at an altitude of 15,000 feet over the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland, and the object was not seen to land or change its course.

Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson,

Now that Jennie has her preliminary clearance, she can help me handle the reports and can type the letters to you and to your successor. This will improve the quality of the typing. As I am sure, I cannot guarantee spelling.

With regards to the two wires you sent us on June 23, there is only one thing to say: The 21 June Pepperrell AFB case must be tossed out because of grossly insufficient data. You think there is a glimmer of anything interesting there which would justify sending a form AI-I to Cleveland, but this kind just chatter up the wires.

The San Antonio 16 June is clearly a meteorological phenomenon and one that would warm the heart of Tansill. This was undoubtedly as suspected, namely settling into on a high cloud.

Referring to the follow-up statement on the 10 June Detroit case, both demise and I still think this was a landing light and stare it could not have been a meteor.

Delaneya is a little slow. Jen is going ahead with requesting cooperation from the air control tower operators. Her usefulness has increased in view of her temporary clearance and I hope that her full clearance will not be too long in coming.

I hope we can see you soon and wish you a bon voyage into law school.

Sincerely,

Allen Hynek
