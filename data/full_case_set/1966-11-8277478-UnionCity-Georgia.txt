The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a sketch at the top showing the relative position of an unidentified object in the sky. The sketch includes a compass rose, angles, and labels indicating the object's height above the horizon. There is also a section below the sketch asking the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object and any changes in direction during its course. The rest of the page contains text, but no additional photographs.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the horizon to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the horizon where you first saw it. Please show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "B" where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
