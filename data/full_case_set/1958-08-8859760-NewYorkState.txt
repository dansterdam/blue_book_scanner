ATIC FORM 329 (REV 26 SEP 52)

Gentlemen;

I do not know to whom to address this letter, but I am prompted to report what seems to be an unusual phenomenon.

Last night, August 3, my husband and I were driving West on the New York State Thruway South of Newburgh, N.y., when a brilliant green ball of fire fell from the sky and disappeared behind a low hill to the North. This happened in two stages. After we first spotted the object it seemed to be paced by something else. Then it fell, taking a second. Regularly while in this state it flashed at about one second intervals for what I would estimate about 4 flashes before it disappeared. 

At the time I thought it to be the only accurate report of what I saw, as that is what my husband saw.

Since that time we have been making a number of measurements and estimates of angle and time and do not beleve it could have been a plane flying not more than 10 feet above the ground.

I do not know what that would be doing there, nor have ever seen anything like that. All I could think that it may have been a meteor which split, and wished to report it from another scene.

Sincerely,
(redacted)

P.S. I have the various sources to whom I have related this incident.
