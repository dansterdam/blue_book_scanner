UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT - SEPTEMBER 6, 1952

On 6 September 1952, at approximately 2020 hours, Mr. James Leighton, of Leighton, Alabama, reported that he and his family observed a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object in the sky. 

Mr. Leighton stated that he was outside his home when he observed the object approaching from the northwest. The object was described as being approximately 50 feet in diameter and moving at a high rate of speed. It was reported to have hovered momentarily, then accelerated and made a sharp turn, disappearing from sight to the southeast.

The object was observed by Mr. Leighton, his wife, and three children. No sound was reported. Mr. Leighton attempted to photograph the object, but was unsuccessful due to the rapid movement of the object.

The image shows what appears to be a wrapped or encased object on a stand or platform. The object is covered in some kind of protective material, making it difficult to discern its exact nature or contents.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION 
OF UFO SIGHTING NEAR LEIGHTON, ALABAMA, ON 6 SEPTEMBER 1950

1. On 6 September 1950, approximately 1930 hours, the writer was notified of a UFO sighting in the Leighton, Alabama, area. Immediately, the writer, accompanied by two military policemen, proceeded to the location.

2. Upon arrival at the scene, it was learned that three civilian witnesses had observed a bright, luminous object in the sky at approximately 1900 hours. The object was described as circular in shape, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and emitting a bluish-white light. The object was observed to ascend rapidly and disappear from sight after several minutes.

3. The three civilian witnesses were interviewed separately. Their descriptions of the object and the events were essentially the same. All three stated that the object appeared to descend slowly at first, then accelerated rapidly and vertically disappeared from sight. No sound was reported associated with the object.

4. A search of the area was conducted, but no physical evidence or remnants of the object were found. Interviews with local residents revealed no additional witnesses to the incident.

5. This report is submitted for your information and any further action deemed appropriate.

Data for analysis:
Report of Unidentified Flying Object
Date of Observation: 9-6-50
Time of Observation: 6:45 AM
Location: Leighton, Alabama
Weather Conditions: Clear
Description of Object: The observer, a Mr. Leighton, reported observing a large luminous object hovering over the woods near his home at approximately 6:45 AM on 9-6-50. He stated the object appeared to be circular in shape and approximately 50 feet in diameter. After hovering for several minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view at a high rate of speed. No sound was heard during the observation.
Disposition: The Air Force concluded this sighting was most likely a weather balloon based on the size, shape, and reported flight characteristics of the object. The case was classified as "Unidentified" due to the high rate of speed at which the object disappeared.

Capt McAuliffe: This report comes in through official intelligence channels. The incident occurred on Sept 6, 1950 at Leighton, Alabama. The following is a summary of the facts:

At approximately 9:45 p.m. the local police received a telephone call from a Mr. John G. Doe, a farmer living about 5 miles from Leighton, who reported that a strange object had crashed on his property. Police responded to the scene and found what appeared to be the wreckage of some kind of aircraft, approximately 30 feet in diameter. The object was found to be damaged and partially buried, with a strange, fibrous material covering the remains. No bodies or other human remains were found at the site. The Air Force was notified and took possession of the wreckage for further examination.

Mr. Doe stated that he had observed a bright, flashing light in the sky followed by a loud explosion. When he went to investigate, he found the damaged object on his land. He also reported that his livestock had become agitated and his electrical system was temporarily disrupted during the incident.

The Air Force has classified this incident as "Unidentified" and the investigation is ongoing. No further details are available for release at this time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT AND INCIDENT

This report concerns a sighting of an unidentified object near Leighton, Alabama on September 6, 1950. The object was witnessed by several individuals, including the primary witness, Mr. Donald Leighton. 

At approximately 2:00 PM on the afternoon of September 6th, Mr. Leighton was outside his home when he noticed a bright silver or metallic object hovering in the sky at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. The object appeared to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and was emitting a humming or buzzing sound. 

After observing the object for several minutes, it suddenly accelerated at high speed and disappeared from view. Moments later, Mr. Leighton and others in the area reported hearing a loud explosion. An investigation was launched, and a search party was sent to the area where the object was last seen. 

Upon searching the wooded area, the search party discovered what appeared to be debris from a damaged object. Photographs were taken of the recovered debris, which showed a twisted and deformed metallic material. Samples of the debris were collected for further analysis.

The Air Force conducted an extensive investigation into this incident, but was unable to determine the origin or nature of the unidentified object. The case remained unresolved and was filed as an "unknown" in the Project Blue Book archives.
