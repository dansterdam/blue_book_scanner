information:

   "On 24 July 1948, the aircraft dispatcher on duty at Warner
Robins A/F Base notified the Maxwell Flight Serv1ce Center that a "floures-
cent cigar-shaped object with a flat exhaust had been sighted at 0250C,
crew, who stated that the object appeared to be wingless and was radiating
a terrific speed. The crew estimated the object to be about twenty-
five feet in length.

   At 0255C Eastern Airlines Houston-to-Atlanta flight reported
similar object in vicinity of Lawson AF Base, and was forced to alter
course to avoid collision.

No further information available this Center."

Reporting Office 660th OSI District Period 10 Aug-25 Aug 1948
Title PROJECT "SIGN" Character of Case Special Investigation 
Walter K. Cecelic SYNOPSIS

1. Basis for investigation:
At 1020, 8 August 1948, this headquarters was advised by letter, dated 6 August 1948, originating at Hq, Air Material Command, Dayton, Ohio, to conduct an investigation and listening to an aerial phenomena reported by various people within the 6th OSI District.

2. Facts:
At 0945, 10 August 1948, Lt Colonel Cropper interrogated Mr. ████████, Robbins Air Force Base employee, regarding an aerial phenomena witnessed by him while on duty at Robbins Air Force Base the night of 23 July 1948. ████████ stated the exact time and pertinent facts regarding the phenomena. ████████ appears to be a competent and qualified observer.

On 19 August 1948, Special Investigator Cassidy conducted Robbins Air Force Base Flight Operations and the Base Weather Station. All reports pertaining to weather conditions and relative time substantially support statements made to Lt Colonel Cropper.

On 12 August 1948, S/A Montgomery, 111th CIC Det, contacted personnel at the Atlanta Naval Air Base and adjoining municipality regarding a reported aerial phenomena. It was generally agreed that the phenomena resembled a shooting star, despite the fact that course and altitude did not correspond to the characteristics of such an aerial phenomena.

During the period, 24-27 Aug 1948, Special Investigator ████████ interviewed seven (7) residents of Augusta, Ga. regarding reported aerial phenomena. it was concluded that objects observed were not aircraft, but probably of metere [sic] nature.

DETAILS

At 0945, 10 August 1948, Lt Colonel Cooper, Acting District Commander, 676th District Office of Special Investigations, interviewed Mr. [Redacted], Robins Air Force Base employee, regarding an [sic] aerial phenomena witnessed by [Redacted] while on duty at Robins Air Force Base on the night of 23 July 1948. The following is a transcript of this interrogation:

Q. 1. What is your full name, age, address, and employment?

A. 1. [Redacted]. I am 23, unmarried, and live at [Redacted], Macon, Georgia. I am a member of the Transient Maintenance Alert Crew on the midnight shift - 2400 to 0800 hours.

Q. 2. Do you recall the date and time that you saw this object?

A. 2. It appeared on Friday night, the 23d of July 1948 between 0140 and 0150 hours, Eastern Standard Time. I was standing Fire guard on a C-47, directly across from Operations, and I had to take down the take-off time which was between 0140 and 0150.

Q. 3. What was the weather condition?

A. 3. Good visibility and no clouds.

Q. 4. Were there any lights around you? Outside lights or beacons?

A. 4. I am not sure whether the flood lights on the hangar were on or OFF. I was facing the north and looking AWAY from any possible lights.

Q. 5. In what direction did you see this object?

A. 5. It was coming out of the north. I was facing the north and actually didn't see it until it got overhead, but it came out of the north and was in my view for about twenty seconds. The last I saw of it the object was fading a southwest course.

Q. 6. Describe in your own words what you actually saw from the time it appeared until it disappeared.

A. 6. The first thing I saw was a stream of fire and it was unidentified as to what it could be, but as it got overhead, it was a fairly clear outline and appeared to be 15 or 20 individual, 3 watt bulbs making a stream of Fire coming out of the tail end. I am sure it would not be a jet plane, since I have observed P-84s in flight at night on two occasions.

DETAILS CONT'D

Q. 7. Approximately what was the height and altitude of this object?

A. 7. Three thousand feet - it could be lower or higher, as at night it is difficult to judge distance.

Q. 8. What was the size and shape in comparison to the trail of fire?

A. 8. The trail of fire was longer than the cylindrical shape of the object.

Q. 9. Was the entire object illuminated? Describe its shape.

A. 9. I noticed a faint glow on the belly of the wingless object - a phosphorescent glow.

Q. 10. Are you familiar with shooting stars?

A. 10. Yes Sir. I thought at first it was a shooting star or a meteor, but a shooting star falls perpendicular. This object was on a straight and level plane. Then it disappeared it disappeared from sight due to distance rather than drop.

Q. 11. How did it differ from a shooting star or meteor in size and shape?

A. 11. I have only seen one or two meteors and they appear to be round or more or less ball-shaped and this object was long and cylindrical in shape.

Q. 12. What was the color of the light?

A. 12. It was a trailing faint blue flame.

Q. 13. Was there any moonlight at this time?

A. 13. I didn't pay too much attention to the moonlight. I wouldn't say for sure whether there was a moon.

Q. 14. Where did the light that illuminated the shape of the object seem to come from?

A. 14. It looked like it was close to the bottom back.

Q. 15. Did it ring you the impression that there were windows or holes and did the object appear to be divided into sections?

A. 15. I am not sure, It would be hard to tell if there were windows and a divided deck could not be recognized from the ground.

Q. 15. Did you read the newspaper account of the two civilian pilots
who saw this strange object about the same time and did the
paper's description seem to refer to the object you saw?

A. 15. I read the write up about the rate of speed. I don't see how
they could tell if it had square or round windows but the
description seemed to fit my impressions.

Q. 17. Was there anyone with you when you saw this object?

A. 17. No Sir. I was standing in front of No. 2 engine and I tried
to call the co-pilot's attention to the object in the sky. He
had already put his headgear on before I could get his attention
and the object was gone.

Q. 18. With whom did you first discuss this matter?

A. 18. I called the tower and asked them if they saw it. They didn't.

Q. 19. What was their reaction regarding this object?

A. 19. They thought I was drunk or seeing things.

Q. 20. Were you unusually fatigued at this time?

A. 20. No Sir, I had been merely reading Air Force magazines prior to
this time.

Q. 21. Have you ever had occasion to read much or study Air Force
magazines, experiments with guided missiles, objects, or similar
material?

A. 21. No Sir, only what I could get out of Air Force and Aviation
magazines.

Q. 22. Were you in the Air Force during the war?

A. 22. Yes Sir, I was an Aircraft Engine Mechanic with a rating of
Buck Sergeant in the Ninth Air Force.

Q. 23. Is there anyone else on the Base who saw this particular object
that you know of?

A. 23. No Sir.

Q. 24. What type of construction, color, size, and material did this
object appear to resemble?

SUBJECT: Project "WARM" CHARACTER: Special Investigation DATE: 9 Sep 43
FILE NO. 333.5 (24-1)

DETAILS: (Cont'd)

A. 24. I would say that it looked like it was about the size of a B-29.
It might have been a little larger, in circumference. It was
too large a bomb. It's hard to tell, a dark color and constructed
of an unknown metallic type material.

25. What would you say its speed was in comparison with other type
aircraft?

A. 25. About seven hundred miles per hour.

26. How did you arrive at that estimate?

A. 26. I have seen P-60 and P-61 type aircraft flying but this was one
of the fastest objects I have ever seen. I saw German V-Is in
the summer of 1944 and they were fast, but this one was even
faster. This object was much larger, A V-1 is very small and
only goes about three hundred miles per hour speed.

27. How did it disappear?

A. 27. Just like an airplane in normal flight fading away from normal
vision.

28. Was there any sound or odors at that time?

A. 28. I heard no sound and everything was quiet. No engines were
running up at that time.

29. How about the maneuverability and exhaust trail of this object?

A. 29. It was flying straight and level and took a changing southwest
course while in sight. The flame seemed to be longer, maybe
due to the object moving through the air.

30. Had you consumed any alcohol in the preceding four or five hours?

A. 30. No Sir, I do not drink.

31. Did you ever see any planes in "Duck Dodgers" comics that resembled
this object?

A. 31. Maybe the length and pointiness resembled, but as far as the ridge,
I couldn't tell if this object had any.

32. What did you say your educational background and Air Force
experience was?

A. 32. I was a high school graduate and I was in 17½ years of your
years.

Q. 34. When did you get out of the Air Force?

A. 34. I was discharged in March 1947 as an enlisted ****** Draft
       Sergeant engineer.

Q. 35. Is there anything further you would like to add to aid in this
       evaluation?

A. 35. Yes Sir. During the Battle of the Bulge, a German and myself
       were on guard duty and saw something that resembled this object
       in question. It later found that he had witnessed the launching
       of a German V-2 rocket. It carried a stage of fire that more or
       less resembled this object. This object looked like rocket
       propulsion rather than jet propulsion, but the speed and size
       was much greater.

Q. 36. Did the altitude, speed, and size of this object have any
       similarity to a meteor or shooting star?

A. 36. No Sir.

Q. 37. What else did you associate your thoughts with when you first
       saw this object?

A. 37. It looked like a rocket and was the shape of an XS-1. It was
       too large for an XS-1. My final conclusion was that it was
       energized by rocket propulsion.

Q. 38. Were you excited when you told the other people about this
       object?

A. 38. No Sir. They more or less kidded me about it and was informed
       that Flight Service wanted to see me.

Q. 39. Who did you talk to in Flight Service?

A. 39. I talked to a men over the teletype system but did not know
       his name. He wanted to know whether it was a civilian or military
       plane and I told him I wasn't sure. I think Flight Service turned
       it over to ADC CenCom the next morning.

July 13, 1961

Maj. William T. Coleman
SAFOI-3
Room 4C-922
The Pentagon
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Bill:

On my return from the western swing I find a sizable amount of accumulated flying saucer material. I want to thank you and Major Friend, and Colonel Evans for all of the helpful material, including the suggestions for improving our chapters. Many thanks to all of you.

On my western trip I ran into a daytime sighting that was a honey. I was driving on Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas to Alamogordo, New Mexico, and I was in the outskirts of the latter city, having just turned west where the road meets the one coming from Las Cruces and the Holloman Air Force Base. The time was 4:00 p.m. The sun was shining, although the sky was heavily clouded toward the west. It had clearly been raining in the mountains and heavy dust storms had forced me to stop two or three times along the highway. I was suddenly startled to see a V-shaped formation of flying saucers heading eastward directly toward me. They appeared to have a reddish glow and were moving very rapidly. I had the impression that they were nearly at cloud level. They approached me rapidly and suddenly seemed to drop in on me. I then realized that they were merely a grouping of tumbleweeds carried aloft in the heavy wind. They were, perhaps, some hundred feet over head. The weird glow was caused by the illumination of the setting sun. Keep this in mind for similar reports.

****** and I have been struggling to interpret the famous Rapid City, South Dakota, case of 12 August, 1953. The report has so many features that are suggestive of the mirage of a star, that we have strongly leaned to that interpretation. The bright star, Capella, which happens to be circumpolar at Rapid City, was indeed very close to the horizon, just east of north. We do not have very good times or estimates of the total duration of the sighting- I wonder if you have any additional material that you could send us, in view of the importance that the UFO boys attach to this sighting. In particular, we should like to know what is the radius in miles, of the radar screen and what was the frequency. This weather records indicate...

that a very sizable temperature inversion was present, and this was ample to magnify some of the radar and optical effects. The radar, especially, could have been deflected back to the ground and the moving object might have been some secondary reflection from the plane itself. Is there any additional information about the man who claimed to have checked the UFO against the triangle of stars, and deciding that it moved with reference to those stars? Sounds that it might have been autokinesis, unless this motion was really very sizable.

One further question that we have. A study of the [redacted] case indicates that the UFO was merely a meteor. Apparently this was a considered solution in the early days. We wonder why it was abandoned.

Thank you for the additional sightings, all of which are useful and lend freshness to the book. Also, I think you were going to send me one from the south, where airline pilots reported not only seeing a saucer but certain roughness of the air which, according to your own observation, was due to forest fire or oil well fire, or something of the sort.

Again, with our many thanks and best wishes, I am

Cordially yours,

(A REDACTED ADDRESS), Colorado
February 17, 1960

AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is an article concerning a mysterious silvery tubular
flame-belching object that climbed through Western Alaska skies late
Sunday. I feel sure that this is the same type object that 
almost collided with an Eastern Airlines DC-3 in 1948.

I would like to take this time to review this case for I think
it is outstanding.

For on the evening of July 24, 1948...an Eastern Airlines DC-3
took off from Houston, Texas, & was on a southeast-to-northeast 
****** intercepting stops between. The pilots were Clarence S. Chiles
and John B. Whitted. At about 2:45 a.m.; when the flight was 20 miles
southwest of Montgomery, the captain, Chiles, saw a light dead ahead
and closing fast. His first reaction, he later reported to an ATIC
investigation team, was that it was a jet, but in an instant he realized
that even a jet couldn't close as fast as this light was closing.
Chiles gave the co-pilot, John B. Whitted, the latter on top of which
tap on the arm, and whetted (sic) two with his night pilot on top of signal
Chiles racked the DC-3 up into a tight, left t(em) + us the UFO
flaming jet by about 700 feet by the DC-3's left turbules (sic). And
Whitted looked back just as the UFO pulled up in a steep climb.

Both of the pilots had gotten a good look at the UFO and were
able to give a good description to the Air Force intelligence people.
It was a B-29 fuselage. The windows had in particular a ***** were
"two rows of windows from which bright lights glowed," and a
"50-foot trail of orange-red flame" shot out the back.

By now, does ATIC know what this object was? If so, does ATIC
also know where this object came from?

One thing for sure when you take a object traveling at tremendous
speed about 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the earth, that is bathtub-shaped
would most certainly also be a B-29 unless the object would have *****  
birds had trailing flames shot from ***** go make my
said **** with *****

I will be looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

(REDACTED)

The image provided appears to be a scanned copy of a heavily redacted document. Unfortunately, the quality of the image is very poor, which makes it difficult to discern details. There are no photographs visible in this image; it seems to be a page of text with many parts blacked out. Due to the extensive redactions and the low resolution of the scan, most of the text is illegible, and transcribing it is not possible.

Despite my capabilities, this specific document's condition does not allow me to provide a full transcription. If you have specific questions about Project Blue Book or if there's another document or portion of text that's more legible, I would be able to provide more information on those.

I'm sorry, but the text in the image provided is mostly illegible due to the poor quality and resolution of the image. It is not possible to accurately transcribe the content of the document with this level of clarity. If you have a clearer image or more specific information regarding the content you need transcribed, please provide it, and I will do my best to assist you.

Regarding photographs, there are no identifiable photographs present in this image. It seems to be a xerox or a scanned copy with significant degradation, obscuring any potential details that might resemble photographs.

The image you've provided appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts an elongated, somewhat cigar-shaped object with a grid pattern on its upper section, and some notes and annotations scattered around.

Unfortunately, due to the quality and clarity of the image, I cannot transcribe the text accurately. Most of the words are either too faint or partly obscured, which makes it difficult to read the content reliably. However, I can make out the wording "EXHIBIT 'C'" along with the words "Pearl L. Humes" towards the bottom of the page. The rest of the text is indiscernible in the provided image.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Team Intellig(           by           ) 102-122-79
Intelligence Department
Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio                         2.

a. To exclude irrelevant factors in a systematic manner, the information presented in Exhibit "A" is presented in the order of occurrence and significance.

(1) Incident #1

a. Object was sighted 24 July 19[b]8 between 0140 and 0150 EST from the ground at Robins Air Force Base, Macon, Georgia.

b. Object was again sighted from an altitude of 5,000 feet by ------ ------ while flying a/c no. ------ some 20 miles south of Montgomery, Alabama. The time of sighting was 24 July 19[blurred] at approximately 0215 EST.

c. Both the ground sighting and that of the pilot describe the object as "cigar" or "cylindrical" in shape. (McKe[lr]e perceived only the glow emitted by it)

d. All observers agree that the object was traveling in a general southerly heading and that it was trailed by a flame varying in color and that it behaved like a normal craft insofar as disappearing from the line of sight was concerned.

NOTE: It is a known fact that atmospheric conditions such as varying degrees of humidity and incidence of light re-fraction often influence the color of the light observed. This would serve to explain why many observers conflict in their descriptions as to color of light displayed by the object or its trail.

e. Four witnesses to this sighting are involved; three are trained observers. In no instance were there any indications of sub-
versive or ulterior influences involved.

Both the ground account and that of the ------ and ------ were officially made within a period of time that would preclude any chance of impressions being gained from radio or newspaper reports.

(2) Incident #2

Object #2 was observed by ------ ------ and ------ at 0230 hours 24 July 19[blurred], while airborne, between Blackstone, Virginia, and Greensboro, North Carolina. This sighting is considered separately since the descriptions of speed as "meteoric" or "terrific" the manner of travel described as arc or horizontal, and the fact that it "faded like a meteor" seen to indicate that the object seen was not the one observed in Incident 1.

(3) Incident #3

This object was observed between 2100 and 2130 hours 26th July 19[blurred] at ------, ----- Augusta, Georgia, by observers ------ ------. This object was not thought to be a meteor in that it maneuvered. The glow was described as varied in color but predominantly brilliant blue-white. The course was described as generally "northern."

24 July Incident
1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern
Airlines DC-3, flying at 5000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery,
Alabama, sighted a dull red exhaust some 700 feet ahead, a little
above and to the right of the airliner.

Captain [REDACTED], the pilot, immediately turned to
his co-pilot, [REDACTED], and remarked: "Look, here comes a new
Army jet job. The object approached in a slight dive, deflected
a little to the left and passed the plane on the right, almost
level and parallel to the flight path, at a distance of approxi-
mately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled up sharply and
disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 feet long,
cigar-shaped and about twice the diameter of a B-29. It had no
fins or protruding parts on the front though it had an "snout"
similar to a radar bulge on a B-29, and no higher than approximate-
there was a cabin with windows above—much like a pilot cockpit—
mentequipo but the appeared bright. The illumination inside
the body itself approximated the brilliance of a magnesium flare.
So snow through his nor did Whitted. Visible from the side only,
was thr intense, fairly dark, blue glow running the entire length
of the object on both the fuselage.

The glow was described as of a blue fluorescent factory light.
The exhaust glow reminded them of a red-orange flame, the lighter color
coming out of a sort of double ellipse or double nozzle. The
the stand flashed out from it nozzle in the rear which he thought he
pilot viewed the flame extend some 50 to 100 feet behind the object
and behave similar in intensity (redder) and increased in length as
it became, but more the flame viewed. No disturbance was felt from
the object nor was there any change or mechanical disturbance when
the object passed. No sound was heard.

Co-pilot attention was drawn to the object by very
remarks. His description of the object and its maneuvers was 
similar to that of [REDACTED], except that he did not observe a cockpit
in front, did heed he saw any radar "snout." His drawing and descrip-
tion also indicated windows or openings on the side. He estimated
the object passed at greater distance than did [REDACTED]. No
fins or protruding parts parallel to rather than [REDACTED] came
from the rear of the object, rather than from double nszzle over-
greater any wider than, the width of the object itself, although he
noticed the increased length of the flame as the object "pulled up."

The night was clear with a bright moon and broken cloud cover-
age at 10,000 to 10,500 feet. Both estimated the object to be 4,000
to 5,000 feet in the rear.

The case was evaluated as an obvious mirage! Doc was carried
as unidentified for a time in the Air Force files. The initial
evaluation was made in 1948 by Dr. Allen Hynek. Current analysis
of the data substantiates Dr. Hynek's conclusion and the case is
evaluated as a meteor sighting.

FLYING FLOO^LAMP?
Everybody Seeing
Speedy Sky Bogey

By CHARLES POU
Is that Thing no more than a wayward floor lamp?
Mrs. Noah Atkinson, of Brookhaven, saw it. And what
did that Thing look like?
“A great big floor lamp, all lit up. Oh, it was beautiful!”
And C.C. Fowler, also Mississippi,
told Mils at home in Palos near
the Municipal airport, Sunday
night saw a “huge, brilliantly
lighted object streaking over Atlanta
at what says maybe 30,000 feet.
Mrs. Bowles thinks the Thing was
straight from Moscow.

Two Eastern Air Lines pilots
first were startled by the newest
astronomical 'what-is-it'” near
Montgomery early Saturday. To them, it was “a hugest, roaringest
sputtering flame like a Buick Riviera!
rocket ship,” Millingen, all over
the country. That thing was variously
identified as:
What It Looked Like

1. An aluminum covered balloon.
2. A bail of fire.
3. “An unusually bright light,
just a reddish-blue flame that
burst in mid air.
4. A red and cherry red fire.
5. A flash of cherry red fire.
6. A meteor.
Mrs. Atkinson kept her Flying
Fiooting seeing these things.
But Brookhaven saw'n't seen
things when she saw the thing.
Saw it, and her husband, who also
saw the keener man. The story
really sounded a little silly untill
the two Eastern Air Lines fliers
Thing thumbing and fire-breathing
Thunderbolt in the skies early
Saturday morning.

Fast. Pretty and Fast

After that she decided her tale
could be told.
"My husband and I were sitting
long on our front porch the night
of July 5. Sat on a quarter to 9
o'clock we saw this thing. Our
front porch doesn't have a second
and we were sitting near the
edge! We could see good.
“We saw it first. It was not hight
it looked like it was right above
the trees. 'Looks there,” he
ing to me. “Looka, there!”
It took.
“it looked like the top part
of a floor lamp and it was tilted
and passing over our— Lexus it
must that in back of it came the
fire, have been 50 miles an hour,
at least.”
And now.
“If there's a 'tana’ under heaven,
Whiteid, Ala., and jonna
fmblet, it was a 'tana'.
“Well, they're coming today,
trooping back a picture of
that Thing.

Two Fliers Cling To Story
Of Observing Sky Monster
BOTH AIRMEN
Scoff At Theory
It Was Meteor, Comet
Or Army Balloon

Giant Sighted Over South
Described as 'Glowing'
Made By Man.

Atlanta, July 25—(UP)—Two army B29 Super-fortress pilots reported seeing a huge flame-throwing rocket over Alabama yesterday but insisted stoutly today that what they saw was a man-made flying machine. They added they would recognize the same monster again if they saw it.

This time they'll be armed with still and movie cameras in case the giant craft returns to American skies.

Capt. Clarence S. Chiles, Atlanta, and Co-Pilot John B. Whitted, Savannah, Ga., claimed they saw the needle-like ship, a wingless affair, four times the engines size of a B29 jet plane, on a routine flight from Houston, Tex., early yesterday to Birmingham.

"They say not to investigate strange things. That they handle themselves either it might have been a meteor or comet, reached army radar observation balloons, SCOFFS BALLOON THEORY

The two air Force pilot flatly sc*** when the Air Force hit off suggested said, he had written the idea out of the spacious, and pencils, Captain's mystery.

Their argument Whitted was as follows said the "a monster of the size of the Lions" and of Georgia, Alabama, who to the pilot, Lieutenant Colonel declared he was the third man's (missing text) that "it was definitely not a balloon."

Chiles was also sure that it was not a meteor or comet. He self was made" and the shape or liner was definitely jet-prop, Chiles --- it was more than a jet size.

"From the size of those windows each up the windows "were all lighted." "You could see right through them. You *** easy see the object silhouetted and facilities pilot related.

Windows Not Quite Round

Both agreed that they passed the ship within 15 feet and that they went about 170-50 feet going 170-180.

They will leave for Meridian on the same flight route tomorrow morning, they will have Westover probable where they will be over their about east and the plan to take that Christensen Aires. Is a camera, the movie camera and also a still camera.

Chiles said he had a camera to the window very good the wreckage better Saturday but that it was "too dark in the ship and they couldn't get the lens in time.

Only one of the plane's passengers is on board and the pilot at the time, he saw a "weakness to light" at the time, he was accompanied. Now at the time Pilita C. McCaf fery (ciswible) Lowell Air force, to McAfee out he's, commanding Ohio Chiles also had a camera, on a average ground lens set.

Flame-Shooting, Wingless Plane
Reported Met in Alabama Skies

By The Associated Press

ATLANTA, July 24—Two East-
ern Air Lines pilots said they met
a wingless, two-deck plane nearly
100 feet through west of Montgomery,
Ala. They said the strange ship,
shooting out red flames and with a
blue glow underneath the fuselage,
passed the E. A. L. ship at 5,000 
feet headed toward New Orleans.
The pilots said the strange ship looked
like a "Buck Rogers rocket ship."

The two pilots—Captain S. C.
Pierce and Co-Pilot J. B. Whitfield
—were flying the Houston-to-
Atlanta-to-Boston run Thursday
last. They saw the "rocket" late 
night. They clocked the strange
craft at 2:45 o'clock this morning
twenty miles southwest of Mont-
gomery.

After reaching Atlanta at 3:49
a. m. they told of their strange
experience. Captain Childs said
they first sighted the object up
ahead when nearing Montgomery.

"It was in line almost with our
ship," he said. "We veered off to
the left and this object turned to
us swiftly. When it came nearer, it
was keeping its same path. We could
see it appeared to be about 100 feet
in length and about four times the
circumference of a B-29 fuselage.

"It had two rows of windows, and
upper and a lower. They were
square-cut, out of the rear of the
ship red flames were shooting
twenty-five to fifty feet. There
was a blue glow underneath the
fuselage. The ship appeared to
be doing between 500 and 700
miles an hour, heading toward
New Orleans.

"When it got alongside of us it
flamed up with a tremendous burst
of fire out of the rear. The flames
were so bright they blinded us for a 
second. Then the ship disappeared
into the broken clouds. The MET
was shining intermittendly and she
it would be seen for a few seconds
would then be obscured. Then
it had windows. It seemed to
have an upper deck and a lower
deck and was fully lighted inside.
It was no ocean liner that's
of the twenty passengers Captain
Childs said only one was
awake and saw the other ship.

The third verse classic tall not involve a saucer at all, but a
wingship about 100 feet long, cigar-shaped and abou three
the diameter of a B-29. It went down the night of July 21, 1948,
near Montgomery, Ala., by O. S. Childs and B. Whitfield, pilots
of an Eastern Airlines plane. The rudeness of the thing had a
"deep blue glow," portholes about two feet wide by four feet high,
red flames were now pouring out a 40-foot trail of which
brighly. The only *nowledgined of the flight was made at the
time the crew was told not to fire.

For the benefit of Mr. Whipple, the architect was fairly sure
that this was a different experience since put down and flying 
between Huntsville, Va., and Greensboro, S. C., he reported seeng
objects moving fast across a "bright shooting star" in the 
direction of Montgomery.

Flame-Spitting Aerial Monster Rocked Their DC-3, Pilots Report

ATLANTA, July 24 (UP).— Two pilots of Eastern Air Lines today announced they had encountered a giant, wingless, flame-throwing aircraft straight out of Buck Rogers. Capt. the Chiles and John B. Whitted, his co-pilot, corroborated each other's report on the fantastic plane.

They were flying in a DC-3 Eastern Airline ship, some 5,000 feet about 20 miles southwest of Montgomery, Ala., early today when the thing came out of what they said.

It looked like a B-29 “blown up about four times” and stripped of its wings.

It cast a light more vivid than lightning, they said. They saw two decks of big square windows and what was a man-made thing [rest missing] right," they added, Captain Chiles said.

"The first thing that came to my attention was the long [rest of the column is missing]

stream of fire coming out of the rear end of the pilot orange, or whatever it was."

"When I noticed the two rows of square windows—we couldn't see any people seemed. 

"The aircraft bored the circuit for the times the circumference of a B-29 fuselage but it was only a little longer There were no wings whatever.

"The plane passed us on our right, then as if the pilot had seen us and wanted to avoid us, it zoomed up at 500 to 700 miles per hour into the same cloud it came out of. A 10-foot red [rest missing]

(3) Incident #2 (Continued)

Although the dates seem to indicate that the sighting could not be the same as that described in Incident 1, yet this major portion of this testimony refers to a "blue white light". One witness in the first instance describes a "blue glow" running the entire length of the fuselage. When viewed from the ground, it is logical to assume that the blue glow would be mostly visible.

NOTE: In this connection, Dr. Josef Allen Hynek, astro-physicist, OSUIR, who is presently serving as a consultant on this project, has advised that it is possible for a celestial body to appear to travel in a straight line and then downwards. (It is extremely improbable, although, aerodynamically possible, for some objects to achieve an effect of leaving the atmosphere. Ices generated during their flight through the atmosphere.) It is
this further opinion that it is impossible for any celestial body to maneuver violently and make sharp turns. It is extremely unlikely for heavenly bodies to appear to move slowly when passing through the lower layers of this atmosphere, but, from greater distances, it is possible to observe far-distant bodies for extended periods of time. Objective seems to contact light mass. The number of appearances of a meteorites like a light suddenly blinking off.

Atlanta Pilots Report Wingless Sky Monster

By ALBERT RILEY
Two Atlanta pilots of the Eastern Air Lines have startled the air world with a bizarre story of a strange object which roared past their DC-3 airliner at 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning while 5,000 feet over Montgomery, Ala.

The two pilots, Capt. Clarence Chiles and his co-pilot, John Whitted are puzzled themselves at what they saw as some other Ultimate

"What you look at one of those fantastic Flash Gordon rocket ships in the funny papers. You've got a picture of what we saw," said Whitted.

Twenty four times larger than a B-29 fuselage. It resembled a C-54's rise of flames were shooting out of the tail at a 45 degree angle.

Travelling at a speed they estimated at between 500 and 700 miles an hour, the mysterious object brilliantly lighted within – was in view of the Thunderbird, on the belly of the ship, they said there was a sort of blue fluorescent glow.

It neither flashed from missile chambers, nor is there any evidence of a conventional exhaust, via New Orleans, to Atlanta.

The two pilots saw the strange object whiz past them in the heavy overcast, then hover in midair and finally remind the Mobile and New Orleans. Both pilots, who served as Army Air pilots during the war said they had never seen anything before to match it.

"In my years flying, and that includes every craft navy has in the air, navy weather it could have been," said Whitted Army or CAA officials "No."

As a B-29 bomber pilot during the war, I saw some strange things in Japan," Whitted said, but "I never saw anything like that."

Some planes reported "no touches" and others from Guam said "enemy aircraft." Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker of Eastern Air Lines had a report from Australia, the seventh in eight months at Eastern Lines that a plane possibly a flying craft might be loose, which apparently had been in Europe, reports having come from Ireland.

It's the strangest since the "foo fight," Whitted said.

Rickenbacker commented that "it's time we realize there's something loose around this world." Cruise and this don't use wings. Leave the movie cruising as an observer intimated, propelled by conventional means, and an Air Force spokesman forewarned folk that "no return of this country as no plane compelling a wingless craft, just propellers and foot-diameter rockets tubes."

The pilots said there were no passengers aboard their plane, but all were sleep except one man, C. L. McKelvie, of 545 Renshaw Place, Columbus, Ohio. McKelvie said Chiles told the pilots that he "also saw the monster aircraft some clouds", Chiles said, "and we were flying along on the regular airway, when we saw ahead and slightly above and to our right what appeared to be one enormous jet flame."

"Would it clash? Oh, What! the middle of this either to the left and it veered in 15 feet, flashed about 700 to an out past us at 700 about 700 feet above us."

"Then, as if the pilot had seen up and wanted to avoid us, it pulled up with a tremendous burst of flame out of its rear end and zoomed into even the clouds. Just on top where two jet rockets or of the clouds. It was the saucer saw two DC-3's."

The pilots said they saw it until it was obscured behind the clouds, and Whitted said he counted at no windows but could see no occupants because the ship was keeper too fast.

"The man-made thing all right," said the.

"It was a man-made plane and its jet flames was so bright it almost gave them "something blades if," they said, and then had to turn up their instrument panel lights in their cockpit.

"Must it have used up their fuel in a mere passage?' Chiles said the minutes without saying a word we traverse 20 speeches."

They had reported by radioed simultaneous reporting over Atlanta when they had reached that it wasn't to Memphis near Montgomery, and to Ficklen Fort Ben and Langley Field in organizations on New and March over "Birmingham said they had noted, the 20th "There by the time it left us. Not — remarked shooting stars. civilization."

Was it indeed? Chiles and Whitted both said they were certain it was no meteor or comet, because they had seen them before in the air.

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN CLARENCE S. CHILES

Atlanta, Ga.
Aug 3, 1948

To:
Eastern Air Lines
Miami, Fla.

The following is a report of an unidentified aircraft which was sighted by [redacted] and me, as we were twenty miles southwest of Montgomery, Ala. July 24, 1948, as we were on Eastern's trp 576.

At 2:45 A. M. we were cruising at 5,000 feet when there came, what looked like a jet type of aircraft to our right and slightly above meeting us. It was a clear moonlight night with the visibility excellent; therefore, we were able to view the ship as it passed for a period of around ten seconds. It was clear there were no wings present, that it was powered by some jet or other type of power shooting flame from the rear some fifty feet. There were two rows of windows, which indicated an upper and lower deck, from inside these windows a very bright light was glowing. Underneath the ship there was a blue glow of light.

After it passed it pulled up into some light broken clouds and was lost from view. There was no prop wash or rough air felt as it passed.

After talking to the only passenger awake at the time, he saw only the trail of fire as it passed and pulled into the clouds. I called the company at Columbus and asked if there was any reported jet army craft and requested if the ATC had any aircraft under control. I was told that no such craft was reported by either source.

INCIDENT
24 July 1948

The glow reminded Chiles of a blue fluorescent factory light. The 
exhaust was described as a red-orange flame, the lighter color (orange)
being predominant about the outer edges. [Redacted] thought the flame flared 
out from a nozzle in the rear which he thought he perceived. The flame
extended some 30 to 50 feet behind the object and became deeper in 
intensity (redder) and increased in length as the object pulled up into 
a cloud. No disturbance was felt from air waves, nor was there any 
wash or mechanical disturbance when the object passed. No sound was heard.

Co-pilot [Redacted] attention was drawn to the object by [Redacted] 
remark. His description of the object and its maneuvers was very 
similar to that of [Redacted] except that he did not observe a cockpit in front 
nor did he see any radar "snout". His drawing and description also 
indicated windows or openings on the sides. He estimated the object 
passed at greater distance than did Capt [Redacted] He saw the "exhaust"
as a parallel wide flame which appeared to come from the entire rear 
of the object rather than from a nozzle never growing any wider than the 
width of the object itself, although he noticed the increased length of the 
flame as the object "pulled up".

The night was clear with a bright moon and broken cloud coverage of
4/10 at 6,000 ft. Both estimated the object to be in sight approximately
10 to 15 seconds, considered sufficient time for experienced pilots to 
determine whether the "sight" was a reflection, caused by some rare 
meteorological or astronomical phenomena -- or was a material object.

INCIDENT

24 July 1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern Airlines
DC-3, flying at 5,000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama
sighted a dull red exhaust some 700 feet ahead, a little above and to the
right of the airliner.

Captain [REDACTED] the pilot, immediately turned to his co-pilot,
[REDACTED] and remarked: "Look, there comes a new Army jet job."
The object approached in a slight dive, deflected a little to the left and
passed the plane on the right, almost level and parallel at flight path,
at a distance of approximately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled
up sharply and disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 ft. long, cigar-
shaped and about twice the diameter of a B-29. It had no fins or
protruding surfaces. [REDACTED] thought it had a "snout" similar to a radar
pair on the front and he had the impression there was a cabin with
windows above -- much like a pilot compartment -- except that it appeared
brighter. The illumination inside the body itself approximated the
brilliance of a magnesium flare. He saw no occupants nor did [REDACTED]
visible from the side only, was an intense, fairly dark, blue glow running
the entire length of the object beneath the fuselage.

on such a body would be accompanied by high drag; plus a serious limitation on the range of the aircraft for any particular gross weight. 
IT this type of unidentified aerial objects has extremely long range, it is probable that the method of propulsion is one which is far in advance of presently known engines.

POWER SOURCES

(a) The foregoing discussion is predicated upon the assumption that power sources presently available would have to be used. If an atomic energy powered engine were available, a small mass flow at a large velocity would accomplish the required lift and propulsively force and the large energy expenditure would be of small importance.

(b) However, the head exchange requirements for the atomic powered engine appear to demand physical dimensions of inordinate size that presently would preclude the using of this powerplant for aircraft. Experimental work in progress to convert the energy of the atomic pile directly to electricity, rather than via steam, holds the promise of a more compact atomic powerplant.

Conclusions 1. The flying anomaly observed, remains unidentified as to origin, construction and power source.

2. A definite trend of flight headings has evolved as generally south, in bearing.

3. Supporting evidence from separate reliable sources establish existence of this configuration.

It has been established by Project hands investigation that velocities, at least several times the sonic barriers are adequate for the construction of a space ann... The ...orthrand Casambea Conference concluded ... ... / of the coming years in assembled could support resultant flight by avoic dynamic actions.

```
Flying Fuselages (Torpedo or Cigar-Shaped Body)

a. While the cigar or torpedo shaped body represents an efficient form for the fuselage of an airplane or the body of a guided missile, in neither case has it been used as a primary lift producing surface. However, an extension of the Prandtl theory of lift indicates that a fuselage of the dimensions reported by the Eastern Airline pilots [text redacted] and other civilian/military pilots, having cylindrical dimensions of weight of approximately 12,000 pounds an arbitrarily chosen sailing speed of 150 miles per hour, conservatively estimated. The Prandtl theory probably gives very conservative values of maximum lift for bodies of this shape. If a lift coefficient twice as great were used (such a value has been given by a German scientists for efficiency of his wind tunnel researches in Germany), a gross weight of 21,000 pounds could be supported in the assumed sailing speed.

b. Although the craft sighted by [text redacted] and [text redacted] was reported to be without wings or fins, its possibility is could have been equipped with extensible wings for take-off and landing, containing within these fuselage. Such a use of wings even if very small [text redacted] would be possible iff the wing span ratio is 5 was used (as nearly 90 feet would be possible), 11,000 pounds at a sailing speed of 150 mph. It is possible that the fuselage could also contribute lift which this arrangement, depending upon the de-camage of the wing. This type of aircraft could also be partially supported in the take-off and landing condition by the vertical component of the jet thrust, if the landing and take-off took place with the fuselage axis, or the jet stream directed in a vertical or nearly vertical attitude. Thus the possibility, that the experienced sailor connected within the fuselage, could havve been used, would provider another method for landing and take-off that would allow wingsless flight at very high speed. Such a design could result in a relatively large duration of flight and other corresponding range.

c. While no stabilizing fins were apparent on the "Flying fuselage" reported by [text redacted] system it is possible that vanes within the jets, operated by a gyro-servo system, could have provided the stability, longitudinally, directionality and laterally. The same vanes could also have been used for accomplishing give also balance or trim, as well as control for maneuvering. A square tailed bo by of the type [text redacted] with center of gravity at 52% of center from results in a longitudinally stable sail normal stability provided by static or active induce stability could be produced by fusiliers uses of flow control slots loessd somewhere along the fusilage.

d. The above estimates regarding weight, controllability, stabiitily, etc., are not intended to represent questions regarding the actual use of the torpedo or cigar-shaped aircraft which was [text redacted] by various military and civilian personnel and operated [text redacted] and rapidness in maneuvs [redacted]. In view of the possibility, what can be assumed as a maximum on aircraft could support and control itself by aerodynamic means. The propulsion system on this type of vehicle would appear to be a jet or rocket engine. The specific fuel consumption of engines of this type would be rather high. Thus, coupled with the fact that aerodynamic lift

(c) Incident 4

Object #4 was observed by *** I was. two****
NCOs who lives unnamed and K**** between the 
hours of 2045 to 2050, 26 July 1949, at Chamblee,
Georgia and Augusta, Georgia. A description of this
object seems to indicate that it was a meteor. Three
of the observers said that the object was "football
shaped"; that it appeared to be a "green light with
a silvery tail and that it appeared was 10,000 to 20,000
feet observer stated that it seemed like a string of a ball
small and that it seemed to be 1/4 the size of a full
moon", that "it was a tail-shaped, brilliant light
trailing burning fragments." Two parties spread together
with the descriptio of a multi-colored lights trailing
burning 'fragments' seems to establish this object as a
meteor.

D. COMMENTS

   1. The only incident which possesses absolute intelligence signifi-
cance is Incident #1, it is obvious that this object has not a meteor. There
has not any evidence to support any findings of vulnerability, nor have there
been any major inaccuracies on the part of the witnesses.

   2. Weather reports establish a probe of visibility as stated in the
observ9rs' reports.

   3. Available information from Ordnance, Army, Navy and AF Weather
Bureaus, Inspector Organizations, and others, failed to reveal any evidence
of testing devices to which this incident could be attributed.

   4. Apparently it is not a domestic origin since a thorough check of
this light schedules, as to commercial and government airlines, revealed that in only 
one instance did the reported flight paths cross. (See chart inclosed as
Tab 4). This single exception was the Flight 21, a northwest leg directly
*ndicating two points in AB 29th tactical in a line thereof during 
a 2 hour emulated bombing passes through the approximate area of the 24
July light where the sightings were reported. However, the factors of speed
division of flight, maneuvers, constructions, lights and other factors rule
out the possibility.

   5. Objects similar in indescription have been reported as follows:

   a. Globular-like object capable of fantastic speed was seen 
      during the past summer in broad day light in Germany, Norway
      and USA. 

   b. A Taiwanese,* *****, in the F**** ***. The object
      was observed intermittently through clouds and was reported
      to have two deck-like.

(2) Incident 2

Object #2 was observed by ---- ---- ---- on 24 July 1948, while 
---- ---- at 0300 hours at ---- Villege, near Greens-
boro, between Blacksburg, Virginia, and Greens-
boro, North Carolina.  This sighting is considered
separately since the description of speed as "meteoric"
or "teriffic", the manner of travel described as an 
arc or horizontal, and the fact that it "faded like
a meteor" seem to indicate that the object seen was
not the one observed in incident 1.

(3) Incident 3

This object was observed between 2100 and 2300 hours
both on 13 July at ---- and on 18 July at ----
by observers at Chinoonee, and ----, Georgia, 
Mrs, ---- ----  It 
is thought to be a meteor in that it's apparent "shot"
or "arc" was described as varied in color but predominantly
brilliant blue-white.  The color so well described as 
definitely "southern".  Although the dates seem to 
indicate that this sighting could not be the same as
that described in incident 1, yet the major portion of
tails testimony refers to a "blue white light".  The
sightings in the first instance describe a "glow"
running the entire length of the fuselage.  When viewed
from the sunset it is logical to assume that the blue
glow would be rapidly visible.

NOTE:

In this connection, Mr. Joseph Allen Hynek, astro-
physicist, OSRD, who is presently serving as 
consultants on this project, has advised that it
is possible for a celestial body to appear to 
travel in a straight line and slant downwards.
It is extremely improbable, although theoretically
possible, for some objects to achieve an affect
of 1½" through the forces generated during their
flight through the atmosphere.  It is his further
opinion that it is impossible for any celestial
body to maneuver violently and make sharp turns.
It is extremely unlikely for terrestrial bodies to 
move so very rapidly when passing through the
lower layers of the atmosphere, but, from greater
distances, it is possible to observe "2nd-storm"
shills for extremely short periods of time, (1) active 
flying distinguishable on (1) tilt nose on beam
body off from its axis and (2) star mass.  The 
resultant radiates each cut through time in a
manner sometimes blinding observers.

later describe the object as "cigar" or "cylindrical" in shape. (Objective [Redacted] only the glow emitted by it)

d. All observers agree that the object was traveling in a general northerly heading and that it was trailed by a flame varying in color and that it behaved like a normal craft insofar as disappearing from the line of sight was concerned.

NOTE: It is a known fact that atmospheric conditions such as varying degrees of humidity and inci-
dence of the light refraction often influence the color of light not observed. This would serve to explain why many observers cannot
agree in their descriptions as to color of light displayed by the object or its trail.

A. ORIGIN:

In compliance with verbal instructions from Maj. General Cabell, Director
of Intelligence, AFOI, this hq proceeded to investigate the report concerning
the sighting of an unidentified aerial object in the vicinity of Montgomery,
Ala, occurring 24 July 1948 between the hours of 0140 and 0215 ZI.

B. ACTION TAKEN:

1. On 25 July 1948, Major R. R. L. Limbach, Project Sign Officer,
Mr. L. O. Reynolds, Technical Assistant to Col Gilzenberg, Mr. J. C. Ledford,
Assistant Officer for accidental analysis, Air Division, and Capt R. J. Sorenson,
Security Officer, proceeded to Macon, Georgia where they interviewed Capt
[scribbling] and Mr. [scribbling]. From pilots, and obtained their signed
statements as to the reliability of Mr. [scribbling] as a reliable person to gather
data drawings executed by Colis and facilitated arrangements together
on 31 July 1948 Major Kelley, [scribbling] entered OG service. Together the
same relaivale. A memo citing the source of OHIO raid or Eastern Airlines
said there was a passenger aboard the C-3 piloted by [scribbling] and [scribbling] his
statment is attached as Exhibit "A".

2. Following the above interviews, inquiries were instigated
to big U.S. Naval and commercial airlines by priori vetelvares 2 aug 1948
regarding data on flights movement in the general vicinity of Alabama,
Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, and Carolina, Tennessee and North Carolina.
Charts of these air movements are appended as Exhibit "B".

3. In compliance with IG letter dated 6 July 1948, this office
of [scribbling] investigations (IG) AFOI undertook an investigation pertaining
to an aerial phenomena reportedly seen by various persons within the 6th OSI
District. A complete report of the various sightings, pages 1-16 is appended
hereto and Exhibit "D". Further reports and statements as to reliability are
also appended.

4. After the statements were received, a complete analysis as to
the data and time, geographical location, and description of the object
was charted. The completely assembled data, i.e., statements of witnesses,
reliability statements, airline schedules and the elovated data chart
were forwarded to the various technical agencies to effect an evaluation and
interpretation of the technological factors involved.

V. EVALUATION

1. The collated data chart (Exhibit "A") was drawn up to effect a
true or pattern in regard to the reported sighting.
2. From this analysis, it is evident that times or possibly some
erase incidents were tampered.

out from a nozzle in the rear which he thought he perceived. The flame
extended some 30 to 50 feet behind the object and became deeper in in-
tensity (redder) and increased in length as the object pulled up into a
cloud. No disturbance was felt from air waves, nor was there any wash
or mechanical disturbance when the object passed. No sound was heard.

Co-pilot ******** attention was drawn to the object by ********
remarks. His description of the object and its maneuvers was very simi-
lar to that of ********* except that he did not observe a cockpit in front
nor did he see any radar "blipout". His drawing and description also indi-
cated windows or openings on the side. He estimated the object passed
at greater distance than did Capt. ********* He saw the "exhaust" as a
parallel wide flame which appeared to come from the entire rear of the
object rather than from a nozzle never growing any wider than the width
of the object itself, although he noticed the increased length of the
flame as the object "pulled up".

The night was clear with a bright moon and broken cloud coverage of
4/10 at 15,000 ft. Both estimated the object to be in sight approximately
10 to 15 seconds, considered sufficient time for experienced pilots to
determine whether the "ship" was a reflection, caused by some rare meteor-
ological or astronomical phenomenon -- or was a material object.

After extensive investigation and analysis, and after consideration
of all possibilities, approaches and pertinent data to suggest at least
one valid hypothesis or explanation to the sightings were exhausted, the in-
cident was appropriately classified as a true "Unknown".

GADSDEN – WHITTED
INCIDENT
24 July 1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern Airlines DC-3, flying at 5,000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama, sighted a dull red exhaust some 700 feet ahead, a little above and to the right of the airliner.
Captain [REDACTED] the pilot, immediately turned to his co-pilot, [REDACTED], and remarked: "Look, here comes a new Army jet job". The object approached in a slight dive, dislocated a little to the left and passed the plane on the right, almost level and parallel to flight path, at a distance of approximately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled up sharply and disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 ft. long, cigar-shaped and about twice the diameter of a B-29. It had no fins or protruding surfaces. [REDACTED] thought it had a "snout" similar to a radar pole on the front and he had the impression there was a cabin with windows above – much like a pilot compartment – except that it appeared brighter. The illumination inside the body itself approximated the brilliance of a magnesium flare. He saw no occupants nor did Whitted. Visible from the side only, was an intense, fairly dark, blue glow running the entire length of the object beneath the fuselage.

The glow reminded [REDACTED] of a blue fluorescent factory light. The exhaust was described as a red-glowing flame, the lighter color (orange) [REDACTED] prominent, about the oval orifice. Throughout the time [REDACTED]

Reference — (Redacted) 1TU-, (Redacted), Consolidated Summary, dated 30 Dec 47 "FLYING DISCS"

SUMMARY: Enter careful summary of report, containing substance actually stated. Answer questions who, when, what, why, how, how many, and give date of event, in a final one sentence paragraph give significance. Begin text at page 2

Detailed interrogations have been completed of persons reporting unidentified flying objects in the vicinity of Montgomery, Alabama, 24 and 26 July 1948, between the hours of 2130 and 0245 hours.

Analysis has been made of the compiled statements and other available evidence of each individual interrogated. The analysis was undertaken as only one of 173 reported incidents with an objective toward arriving at a definite pattern or trend in order to determine whether the objects reported were of domestic or alien origin, or a natural phenomena.

COMMENT: Analysis of data under Incident #24 reveals that four separate cases are involved; one having occurred on 24 July 1948 and the others on the 26 July 1948. As a preponderance of evidence is available to sub-
stantiate that in almost all cases an unqualified object was seen within established times and dates over an extended area, pursuing a general Southerly course, Descriptions as to size, shape, color and movements are fairly consistent.

1. The following comments are offered regarding conclusion number 4 of the attached report:

    a. It does not appear logical to bring in a conclusion regarding space ships when it was not discussed in the body of the report. This is not a conclusion that is based on the report so it does not belong in "Conclusions".

    b. The expression, "It is now aerodynamically feasible for subject configura-tion to fly" implies that it was not feasible until the report was written. This does not make sense.

2. It is suggested that a conclusion to replace that discussed above merely states that an aircraft of the configuration described could support itself in flight by aero-dynamic forces.

---

At about 0230 on July 24, 1948, *****, pilot, and Captain ****
***** saw what they thought was an unusual meteor. It was brighter than any
ever seen before and traveling in a horizontal direction, slightly
above the horizon. It was observed for 3 seconds before it died out. At
no time did it appear to travel in a downward direction. *****
discussed the matter that the meteor appeared to be traveling horizontally.

At the time they were traveling between Blackstone, Va., and Greensboro, S.C.,
the sky was clear and the visibility unlimited. They were of magnetic
heading of 240° and estimated the object to be on a bearing of about 210°
from them - that is - about 30° to the left of their heading. It appeared to
be traveling in a southerly direction, above, but close to the horizon.

NOTE: There is a 15 minute variance in time if/this sighting (0230) to the
rocket sighting at 0245 in ***** Montgomery some 1400 to 1475 miles
distant. The time (0230) also tallies within l min. with **** Pilot ****
****** account of sighting a jet or rocket trill just after
leaving Blackstone.

The image contains what appears to be a series of blurred and indistinct objects or shapes against a plain background. The objects vary in shape but are generally crescent or disc-like. They are small and not detailed enough to make out any clear features. There is no context given that provides information about the size, distance, or nature of these objects. It is generally difficult to give an accurate description due to the poor quality of the photograph.

The document quality and preservation state are poor, making it challenging to extract the full text. The visible portions suggest that this is a record relating to a date in July 1969 and possibly a reference to an event from July 1952. The phrases 'DARA' and 'BY USAF' hint at the involvement of some department or agency, possibly the United States Air Force, which is consistent with Project Blue Book's status as a USAF initiative to investigate UFO sightings. The report seems to include details about observations made over a series of days, and there are indications that confidentiality is a concern. Unfortunately, the specific details are mostly lost due to the document's condition.

INCIDENT 
24 July 1948

The glow reminded Chiles of a blue fluorescent factory light. The 
exhaust was described as a red-orange flame, the lighter color (orange) 
being predominant about the outer edges. [blacked out text] thought the flame flared 
out from a nozzle in the rear which he thought he perceived. The flame 
extended some 30 to 50 feet behind the object and became deeper in 
intensity (redder) and increased in length as the object pulled up into 
a cloud. No disturbance was felt from air waves, nor was there any 
splash or mechanical disturbance when the object passed. No sound was heard.

Co-pilot [blacked out text] attention was drawn to the object by [blacked out text]
remark. His description of the object and its maneuvers was very 
similar to that of [blacked out text] except that he did not observe a cockpit in front 
nor did he see any radar "snout". His drawing and description also 
indicated windows or openings on the sides. He estimated the object 
passed at greater distance than did Capt [blacked out text] He saw the "exhaust" 
as a parallel wide flame which appeared to come from the entire rear 
of the object rather than from a nozzle never growing any wider than the 
width of the object itself, although he noticed the increased length of the 
flame as the object "pulled up".

The night was clear with a bright moon and broken cloud coverage of 
4/10 at 6,000 ft. Both estimated the object to be in sight approximately 
10 to 15 seconds, considered sufficient time for experienced pilots to 
determine whether the "sight" was a reflection, caused by some rare 
meteorological or astronomical phenomena -- or was a material object.

"INCIDENT

24 July 1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern Airlines
DC-3, flying at 5,000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama
sighted a dull red outburst come 700 feet ahead, a little above and to the
right of the airliner.

Captain [redacted] the pilot, immediately turned to his co-pilot,
[redacted] and remarked "Look, here comes a new Army jet job.”
The object approached in a slight dive, deflected a little to the left and
passed the plane on the right, almost level and parallel at flight path,
at a distance of approximately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled
up sharply and disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 ft. long, cigar-
shaped and about twice the diameter of a B-29. It had no fins or
protruding surfaces. [redacted] thought it had a "snout" similar to a radar
pala on the front and he had the impression there was a cabin with
windows above - much like a pilot compartment - except that it appeared
brighter. The illumination inside the body itself approximated the
brilliance of a magnesium flare. He saw no occupants nor did [redacted]
visible from the side only, was an intense, fairly dark, blue glow running
the entire length of this object beneath the fuselage."

The image contains a photograph at the bottom. It appears to show a sequence of sketches or images of an unidentified flying object or phenomenon, consisting of three separate frames. These frames portray the object in different positions or moments in time, suggesting movement. The object depicted is somewhat sinuous or wave-like, with undulations along its form.

Here is the OCR output of the text in the document:

---

on such a body would be accompanied by high drag; plus: a serious limit-
ation on the range of the aircraft for any particular gross weight.
IF this type of unidentified aerial object has extremely long range, it
is probable that the method of propulsion is one which is far in advance
of presently known engines.

POWER SOURCES

(a) The foregoing discussion is predicated upon the
assumption that power sources presently avail-
able would have to be used. If an atomic energy
powered engine were available, a small mass flow
at a large velocity would accomplish the required
lift and propulsive forces and the large energy
expenditure would be of small importance.

(b) However, the head exchange requirements for the
atomic powered engine appear to demand physical
dimensions of inordinate size that presently
would preclude the use of this powerplant for
aircraft. Experimental work in progress to con-
vert the energy of the atomic pile directly to
electricity, rather than heat, offer the promise
of a more compact atomic powerplant.

Conclusions: 1.  The flying anomaly observed, remains unidentified 
as to origin, construction and power source.

2. A definite trend of flight headings has evolved as 
generally South, in bearing.

3. Supporting evidence from separate reliable sources
establish existence of this configuration.

Flying Fuselages (Torpedo or Cigar-Shaped Body)

a. While the cigar or torpedo shaped body represents an ef-
ficient form for the passage of an airplane or the body of a guided missile,
in neither case has it been used as a primary lift producing surface.
However, an extension of the Pradt theory of lifts indicates that a fuse-
lage of the dimensions reported by the Eastern Airline pilots, xxxxx and
xxxxx, in the Montgomery, Alabama, incident could support a gross weight
of approximately 12,000 pounds as an arbitrarily chosen sailing speed
of 150 miles per hour, conservatively estimated. The Pradt theory
probably gives very conservative values of maximun life for bodies of this
shape. If a lift coeficient two as great were used (such a value has
been given by a German scientist Emergency of his wind tunnel researches
in Germany), a gross weight of 21,000 pounds could be supported at the
assumed sailing speed.

b. Although the craft sighted by xxxxx and xxxxx was reported
to be without wings or fins, its possibility is could had been equipped
with extensible wing code to-off and landing, containing win thin these
leg. Such a case is wing span of only 20 from could cross, in
such a seelgt ratio of 5 would used (is near man 9 seats would be possible),
the wing span unnecessary would be as xxxxxxxxx 100 pounds, xxxx 15,000
pounds as to sailing speed of 150 mph. It is possible that the fuselage
coul instance contribute lift in this augment, depending upon the in-
cidence on the wing. This type of aircraft could also be partially sup-
ported off shape to take-off and landing condition by the vertical component
or the jet thrust, if the landing and take-off took place with the fus-
lage axis, or the jet stream direction in a vertical or nearly vertical
attitude. Thus a fuselage possibly that as would provide a concerned
within the fuselage, could that would allow would prior, other method
for landing and take-off to be utilized, would therefore at very high
speed. Such a design could result in a relatively large duration of
flight and over corresponding range.

c. While no stabilizing fins were apparent on the "Flying
Fuselage" reported by xxxxx and xxxxx, it is possible that vanes with-
in the jets, operated by a gyro-servo system could have provided the
stability, longitudinally, directionally and laterally. The same vanes
could also have been used for accomplishing take-balle on the gyro, as
well as control for maneuvering. A square tailed bo by oy of the type rep-
resenting the center of gravity could possibly for xxxxx xxx as 9 longi-
tudinal stabe, A critical stability could be attained cetr 47 de to
lift className, stability would be provided by judicious us of the elemento
control slors located somewhere along the fuselage.

(4) Incident 4

Object #4 was observed by ### ###. ###., between the
hours of 2045 to 2050, 26 July 1948, at Chumblee,
Georgia and Augusta, Georgia. Description of this
object seems to indicate that it was a "meteor". Among
of the observers said that the object was "football
shaped"; that it seemed to be a green light with
a silvery tail and that its speed was 1500 to
1800 miles per hour. An observer stated that the speed was the time of a full
moon"; that it was a tail-bowed, brilliant light
trailing burning fragments. This terms spread together
with the description of a multi-colored lights trailing
burning fragments seems to establish this object as a
meteor.

D. COMMENTS

1. The only incident which possesses absolute intelligence signifi-
cance is Incident #1. It is obvious that this object was not a meteor.
There has been no eye-witness to similar aerial sightings of vulnerability, nor have there
been any major inaccuracies on the part of the witnesses.

2. Weather reports establish a 6000 ft. visibility as stated in the
observers' reports.

3. Available information from Ordinance, Army, Navy and AF Weather
Bureaus, Research Divisions, and other fields, failed to reveal any evidence
of testing devices to which this incident could be attributed.

4. Apparently it is no coincidence since a thorough check of
flight schedules, both commercial and governmental, revealed that in only
one instance did the reported flight paths cross. (See closely inclosed
Exhibit "#".) This single exception was the Flight ###, a non-scheduled cargo
plane, Convair Two-eighty. Its path was charted to the interior # as
well as remote locations have passed through the approximate areas of the 24
July lights where the sightings were reported. However, the factors of speed
velocity of flight, maneuvers, constructions, lights and other factors rule
out the possibility.

5. Objects similar in manifestations have been reported as follows:

- A spheroid-likes object capable of fantastic speed was seen
crossing vast space during broad daylight in emergency, Norway
last week.

- A Washington Coast, Amelia, "The Eagle, Columnist, reported
he had observed, "several times" a similar
was seen intermittently through clouds and was reported
to have two deck-plates attached.

(2) Incident 2

Object #2 was observed by 23 July 1948, while 
midnight of 0300 hours 24 July 1948, Charlotte 
Airborne, between Blacksburg, Virginia, and Greens-
boro, North Carolina. This sighting is considered 
separately since the descriptions of speed as "meteoric" 
or "terrific", the manner of travel described as an 
arc or horizontal, and the fact that it "faded like 
a meteor" seems to indicate that the object seen was 
not the one observed in incident 1.

(3) Incident 3

This object was observed between 2100 and 2300 hours 
28th July 1948, at Clinton, and Mazula, Georgia, 
by observers  These observers 
thought it to be a meteor in that this object was not 
only described as varired in color but predominantly 
brilliant blue-white. The course was described as 
generally "southern". Although the dates seem to 
indicate that this sighting could not be the same as 
that described in incident 1, yet the major portion of 
tails testimony refers to a "blue white light". The 
observations in the first instance describe a "column of 
flame running the entire length of the fuselage. When viewed 
from the ground it is logical to assume that the blue 
glow would be readily visible.

NOTE: In this connection, Mr. Josef Allen Hynek, astro-
physicist, CAAAP, who is presently serving as 
consultant on this project, has advised that it 
is possible for a celestial body to appear to 
travel in a straight line and slant downwards. 
(It is extremely improbable, although theoretically 
possible, for lie objects to achieve an effect 
of lift through the forces generated during their 
flight through the atmosphere. It is his further 
opinion that it is impossible for any celestial 
body to maneuver violently and make sharp turns. 
It is extremely unlikely for heavenly bodies to 
seem to move slowly when passing through the 
lower layers of the atmosphere, but, from greater 
distances, it is possible to observe - and mis- 
taken for extraterrestrial craft of these - objective 
flying objects; one (1) at lift due to heating 
by rays from the sun and (2) star mass. The 
matter of intelligence cannot suggest like in any 
intelligent binding orb.)

ORIGIN:

In compliance with verbal instructions from Maj General Cabell, Director
of Intelligence, AFO, this is proceeded to investigate the report concerning
the sighting of an unidentified aerial object in the vicinity of Montgomery,
Ala., occurring 24 July 1948 between the hours of 0140 and 0225 EST.

ACTION TAKEN:

1. On 25 July 1948, Major R. H. Lovewell, Project SIGN Officer,
Mr. L. Overholser, Technical Assistant to Col Gilzenan, Mr. A. C. Loedding,
Assistant to the Colonel, Air Materials Division, and Capt R. J. Searles,
AFO, proceeded to Robins Air Force Base, Georgia where they interviewed Capt
and Mr. . All parties made statements signed
statements as to their inability to observe, and collected them together
with drawings executed by and indicated any deviation
from normal flying conditions From Eyewitness Accounts by
radio message. A memo during the course of 0140 and 0225 EST.
a C-47 passenger airplane aboard a DC-3 piloted by of the
statement is attached as Exhibit "E".

2. Following the above interviews, requests were transmitted
to HQ, USAF, Naval and commercial airlines by priority teletypes 2 Aug 1948
requesting data on flight movements in the general vicinity of Alabama,
Florida, Mississippi, Georgia. , South Carolina, Tennessee and North Carolina.
Charts of these air movements are printed as Exhibit "D".

3. In compliance with HQ AFO letter dated 6 July 1948, the Sixth Office
of Special Investigations (IG) AFO undertoook an investigation pertaining
to an aerial phenomena reportedly seen by various persons within the Sixth OSI
District. A complete report of the investigation, pages 1-16 is appended
hereto and Exhibit "D". Further reports and statements as to reliability are
also included.

4. After the statements were received, a complete analysis as to
the date and time, geographical location, and description of the object
was charted. The completely assembled data i.e. statements of witnesses,
reliability statements, airline schedules and the collated data chart
were forwarded to the various technical agencies to affect an evaluation and
interpretation of the technological factors involved.

EVALUATION:

1. It is collated that charts (Exhibit "E") was drawn up to affect a
true or positive in regard to the reported sighting.

2. From this case, it is evident that at times or possibly from
certain incidents were lamped.

Enter careful summary of report, containing substance tactically stated.  Answer questions who, when, what, how, how many, and give date of event,
in a final one sentence paragraph give significance.  Begin text at page 2

   Detailed investigations have been completed of persons reporting 
   unidentified flying objects in the vicinity of Montgomery, Alabama, on 24
   and 26 July 1948, between the hours of 2130 and 0215 hours.

   Analysis has been made of the compiled statements and other available 
   evidence of each individual interrogated. the analysis was undertaken as
   only one of 173 reported incidents with an objective toward arriving at a
   definite pattern or trend in order to determine whether the objects re-
   ported were of domestic or aline origin, or a natural phenomena.

   COMMENTS: Analysis of data under Incident #144 reveals that four separate
   cases are involved; one having occurred on 24 July 1948 and the others
   on the 26 July 1948, An Appreciationof evidence is available to gain
   establish that in almost all cases an unqualified objective was seen within
   stated times and dates over an extensive area, pursuing a general southerly
   course. Description as to size, shape, color and movements are fairly 
   consistent.

1. The following comments are offered regarding conclusion number 4 of the attached report:

    a. It does not appear logical to bring in a conclusion regarding space ships when it was not discussed in the body of the report. This is not a conclusion that is based on the report so it does not belong in "Conclusions."

    b. The expression, "It is now aerodynamically feasible for subject configura-
tion to fly" implies that it was not feasible until the report was written. This does not make sense.

2. It is suggested that a conclusion to replace that discussed above merely states that an aircraft of the configuration described could support itself in flight by aero-
dynamic forces.

At about 0230 on July 24, 1948, [redacted], pilot, snd [redacted]
[redacted] saw what they thought was an unusual meteor. It was brighter than any
ever seen before and traveling in a horizontal direction, slightly
above the horizon. It was observed for 3 seconds before it died out. At
no time did it appear to travel in a downward direction. [redacted]
The discussed the matter that the meteor appeared to be traveling horizontally.

At the time they were traveling between Blackstone,Va., and Greensboro, S. C.,
the sky was clear and the visibility unlimited. They were of magnetic
heading of 210° and estimated the object to be on a bearing of about 210°
from them - that is - about 30° to the left of their heading. It appeared to
be traveling in a southerly direction, above,ut close to the horizon.

NOTE: There is a 15 minute variance in time if this sighting (0230) to the
rocket sighting at 0245 in also Montgomery some 100 to 175 miles
distant. The time (0230) also tallies with Incl, 1148 Pilot [redacted]
account of sighting a jet or rocket trail just after
leaving Blackstone.

---
Shortly after checking Blackstone, at approx 0230, a trail was picked up that
appeared to be a jet or rocket trail. The object leaving the trail was 
traveling at terrific speed in a southwesterly direction and as nearly as
they could estimate they calculat'd the degree of travel as 230°

They were on a heading at the time of 215°. The jet or rocket trail at no 
time crossed their flight path. It was on the distant western horizon at
approx 20° above the horizon. The trail covered an 80° to 90° arc laterally.

NO ID: There is a 15 minute difference in time if this sighting (0230) to
the rocket sighting at 0245 in some 400 to 475 miles distant.

NOTE: The above time (0230) tallies with another sighting by another pilot
in the vicinity of Blackstone, Va., who saw a very unusual meteor that
appeared to be on a bearing of about 210° from them traveling in a 
southerly direction above but close to the horizon.

Supplement to Trip Report to Sulzbman, Ohio - 31 July 1948
Re: Atlantic Sighting

FROM: Col. Clingerman

TO: Col McCoy

1. The object of this trip was to interview ------- a passenger
aboard the Eastern Airlines DC-3, the night of 24 July ------

2. Mr. ------ written statement is essentially as follows: He
was occupying the 5th or 6th seat from the rear of the plane on the right
hand side and would periodically glance out the window. There was a full moon which
illuminated the ground and the skies and the ground could clearly be seen.
Frequently they passed cumulus clouds. On one occasion as he was looking
out he observed a sudden streak of light moving in a southwesterly direction
across the plane several miles distance. He wondered if it was lightning but
observed the flaw comparison in a sheet of Tulsa, and it left a red light. The color
was bright flame - the trail left was probably caused its color, no deduction
the object orange red on yellow flame. He shifted his position in his seat
for better observation, instructively looking left of it. Then he saw it
again. He estimated the time to be about 1/2 sec for above the plane as the
plane was above the ground. He saw no physical shape - only a streak of
flame moving in a straight line. The whole experience was momentary to that
ceilibrated observation was absent. He heard no sound but stated that the
vibration of the plane was much greater than normal and that it was not possi-
ble to hear any sound from the outside.

5. In this interview Mr. ------ stated to Maj Llewelyn that the
pilots seemed quite excited and that they expressed nervous over the episode.

erall hundred feet of the DC-3 and then shot up into the clouds.
