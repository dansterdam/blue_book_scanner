Here is the text transcribed from the document:

UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS SIGHTED NEAR MOSES LAKE, MONTANA
Residents in the Moscow, Idaho area reported that on Tuesday night four unidentified objects were observed over the Moses Lake area near Moses Lake, Montana. The objects were reported to be circular in shape and were seen moving swiftly across the sky for about 25 minutes before disappearing. The report states that the objects appeared to be under intelligent control.

Chinook, Montana  
5 October 1952

J. Edgar Hoover, Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

This letter is to inform you that a flying saucer sighting was taken from the Great Falls Montana Tribune of October 4, 1952. This was of interest to me and is one of the reasons which has the people worried. 

During this past summer while airborne, I noticed this object or flying object each as this one described, which appeared to be larger and which appears similar to other reportings.

It was described as a tear shaped object. It was a small parachute made of light blue colored nylon to which a small light is attached. Attached to this small light is a small shaft or rod which appears similar to other reporting.

I carried this flying object from the ground and kept it for several hours to examine it, but then it was missing. 

Flying objects or flares, such as those, could be released from flying aircraft, and when carried by the wind could be reported as flying objects or flares.

Informed people know that Rabbit Visuals' statements in newspapers and defiance of our government or military are not considered seriously. These flying objects would vary, would be evaluated from our standpoint (perhaps location, observations) and people are doing just that.

With best regards, I am

The image contains a black and white photograph of a document titled "Flying Objects Sighted in State Skies". The document appears to be a report or informational material about unidentified flying objects sighted in Montana.

FLYING OBJECTS SIGHTED IN STATE SKIES
HELENA (AP) - Unidentified flying objects reported in state skies during the past week range from an object moving at "terrific speed" to a blue light with a flashing red light.
One report, near Livingston, describes objects that "seemed to bounce and dance around in the sky." Another report from Miles City describes an unidentified object moving at a "terrific speed" in the night sky.
From Glendive comes a report of a "blue top and red bottom" object that hovered then moved off rapidly. Reports from other areas describe a "blue light with a flashing red light" and an unidentified object that "seemed to be rotating as it moved across the sky."
The objects reported seem to have been of various sizes, shapes and colors, and have been seen at various times of the night and day, according to the reports.
