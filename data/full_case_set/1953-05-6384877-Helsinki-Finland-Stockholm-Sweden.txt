ATIC DOCUMENT: 12h30Z, Area reported on: FINLAND
Following is a translation of an article which appeared in the Helsinki, Finland, daily paper on 19 March 1953. According to this translation, a round, shiny object was observed passing horizontally through the sky at a very high speed. This object was seen to cross the city in a few seconds. Similar optical phenomena was observed also in Stockholm, Sweden, at about the same time.
Further reports added to the description of this object. A reliable source stated that the object was estimated to be about 15-20 meters in diameter. It was observed due West of the tower, traveling in a estimated direction of 200°. The altitude could not be estimated, but the single observer gave the impression of its surface and a line from the observer to the object was approximately 30°. It was observed for 1 seconds and then apparently disappeared behind clouds.
ATIC Comment: Appears to be a standard description of a meteor.-Dr. Robinson of ATIC has reviewed this incident and believes it probably was a meteor.
