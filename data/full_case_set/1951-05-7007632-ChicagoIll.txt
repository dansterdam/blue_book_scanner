THE OBJECT WAS BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR AND MOVED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE OBJECT WAS PERFECT. THE ROCKET HAD AN EXHAUST OF FLAME WHICH WAS ABOUT A MILE LONG. THE OBJECT HAD A SLIGHT WOBBLE AND OSCILLATED BACK AND FORTH LIKE A FISH GLIDING THRU SPACE SENDING MORSE CODE. THE ROCKET FLEW IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. IT DISAP-PEARED FROM A NORTHEAST COURSE, FINALLY TURNING WESTERLY AND DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT. OTHER NEIGHBORS ALL WATCHED FLIGHT OF THIS ROCKET.

SUBJECT NOTIFIED PRESS OF THIS ROCKET BECAUSE HE ASSUMED THAT IT HAD BEEN SEEN BY MANY PEOPLE. HE SAW NO NOTICE OF SUCH A SPECTACLE IN THE DAILY PAPERS AND FINALLY CALLED FIELD ARTILLERY OBSERVANCE CONTROL, WHICH IN TURN ADVISED HIM TO CALL FIFTH ARMY INTELLIGENCE. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THEY HAVE INFORMATION OF ANY SUCH ACTIVITY AND ADVISED ACCORDINGLY.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing "Other Winged UFOs" observed in the sky on May 29, 1951 in Downey, California. The document discusses details about the objects observed, including their speed, size, and the lack of a visible trail or sound they made. It concludes by stating that the unknowns must be interplanetary in origin.

One such incident occurred at Downey, California, on May 29, 1951. Late in the afternoon three technical writers for North American Aviation were standing outdoors chatting and looking at the sky when suddenly they noticed about thirty glowing, meteorlike objects moving in the east, about 45 degrees above the horizon. They made no sound and left no trail. Emitting an intense electric-blue light, the objects made fantastic right-angled turns and swept across the sky in an undulating vertical formation, apparently covering about 80 degrees of sky in about 25 seconds. The diameters of the objects were estimated at 30 feet, and the speed at 1,700 miles an hour. [...]
