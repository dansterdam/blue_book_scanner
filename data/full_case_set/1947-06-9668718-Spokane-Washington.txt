The text in the document reads as follows:

Incident #22 -- Spokane, Washington -- 21 June 1947

This incident does not have any, obvious astronomical
explanation.

The information given is too limited to suggest any definite
interpretation. It would seem, however, that the objects might pos-
sibly have been a series of balloons.

The image appears to be a scanned page from a document with some age-related damage and discoloration. There is a small, smudged, and indistinct black mark near the bottom right side of the page that may resemble a rudimentary illustration or a mark, but it is neither a clear photograph nor a detailed image, so it cannot be accurately described as a photograph.

Performing an OCR to extract the text from the document as accurately as possible, the visible text appears to read:

Commanding Officer,
     4th Air Force

HEADQUARTERS
AIR MATERIAL COMMAND
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

ATIC-LO 5 June 1949

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: :Chic. AMT Weather Service,
Andrews Air Force Base, 
Washington 25, D. C.
ATTN: AFSO

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investi-
gation and interpretation of data relative to sighting of unidentified
flying objects. Attached hereto for study and return with the file
of Project "SIGN" are forwarded incidents 52 through 172 from the file
which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine
synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological
Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached
may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purpose.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball
lightning. Research by the Army, Navy or United States Weather Bureau
conducted by persons or persons in behalf of this command and which are
designated as directed by both Project SIGN, MCIAO-3-4. These
checks are definite from the checks of synoptic balloon flights made by
weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department
of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed inci-
dents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This
list does not eliminate the possibility that any of the remaining
incidents are balloons.

UNCLASSI...

On Saturday June 21st, shortly before noon, I was in our yard at 
home when I happened to glance up at a passing plane. I would say 
this was a two motored one from one of the army bases, flying south 
at about 10,000 or 12,000. feet. On the mere glance at the plane 
a bright shiny flash attracted my attention, coming from approximately 
two or three thousand feet lower than the plane, but slightly ahead 
of my line of vision of's plane. My first thought was air 
plane had thrown out some leaflets, but this could not be as they 
(the flashes or disks) were ahead of the plane. On thing different 
tho, it seems to me they were not travelling as fast as the plane. 
We realize to, now, that whatever they were, they must have been 
quite large, being as plain as the nearest one was, yet so high. 
And again, they were traveling south against prevailing winds. At 
least some of the smaller flashes, if not all were as high or higher 
than the plane, but the nearest one seemed lower, both when it flashed 
and otherwise, as it did intermittently.
