This image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes a sighting of an object that was observed and analyzed, comparing it to the planet Mars. It mentions technical details such as the object's brightness, size, and visibility. The document also discusses the possibility of launching a "lunar probe" rocket, indicating this was likely part of the space exploration efforts during this time period.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

WASHINGTON, AUG 2, 1958
MOONWATCHERS EARLY TODAY TO GO BACK TO SLEEP -- THAT WAS NO ROCKET.
IT WAS THE PLANET MARS. A NAVAL OBSERVATORY SPOKESMAN SAID:
IT APPEARED ALL ASTRONOMY WAS STIRRED UP OVER THE PLANET MARS. OBSERVATION BY TELESCOPE SHOWED THAT IT WAS VERY BRIGHT OBJECT, SUCH AS IT OFTEN APPEARS WHEN IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY CLOSE TO THE EARTH.
CYCLES CALCULATE THAT ITS BRIGHTEST PERIOD WAS LAST NIGHT SAID. AND WITH THE FULL MOON ALSO IN THE SKY, OBSERVERS SAID, THE BRIGITNESS OF THE PLANET MARS WOULD BECOME INCREASINGLY BRIGHTER. IN RELATION TO THE MOON, DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS, WHICH IT NORMALLY WOULD SEEM DIMMER.
THE BRIGITNESS WOULD DIM SLOWLY DURING THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. ASTRONOMERS DISCLOSED THAT MARS IS NOW 35,000,000 MILES FROM THE EARTH, AND BETWEEN AUG. 17 AND AUG. 20, ALTHOUGH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS MAY DELAY IT, THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO LAUNCH THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF LUNAR PROBES. WITH THE FLIGHT OF THESE PROBES POSSIBLY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE.
A MOON SHOT OF THEIR OWN AND THE FIRST HAVE BEEN REPORTED THEY ALREADY TRIED ONCE, BUT FAILED.
PHONED BY EXCITED CITIZENS WHO REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE WESTERN SKY. THE OBSERVERS AT THE OBSERVATORY SAID THE OBJECT WAS MOVING TOWARD THE MOON.
MOON SAILORS SEEM TO DISPEL THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL. MARTHA SHEPARD, A FORMER NAVAL OBSERVATORY CONSULTANT, SAID SCIENTISTS COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE OBJECT, TOO, ALTHOUGH IT WAS MOVING IN A WAY SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A PLANET MOVE BEFORE. SHE CONSULTED THE OBSERVATORY ON THE MATTER, SHE SAID.
MARS WHICH HAPPENS TO BE AT THAT ANGLE JUST NOW -- BUT MUCH FARTHER AWAY THAN THE MOON.
AT THE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, ASTRONOMER OWEN GINGERICH SAID THE SIGHTING WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BRIGHT OBJECT, BUT HE SAID IT WAS A BRIGHT STAR OR POSSIBLY A PLANET.
MATHETICALLY SAD NO ROCKET FIRED FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON WOULD REMAIN VISIBLE IN SPACE FOR VERY LONG. IT
BECAME VISIBLE ON SPACE FOR VERY LONG. IT WOULD JUST WOULDN'T BE BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE THE BRILLIANCE OF A STAR OR PLANET.
NO ROCKET WAS FIRED ACCORDING TO NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY, WHICH TRACKS THE U.S. AND RUSSIAN EARTH SATELLITES.
ALTHOUGH THE MOON, FRANKLY, SAID THE SIGHTING WAS ACTUALLY FOR REVENGE. TOWARD THAT SOMETHING IN ADDITION TO THE MOON, AS NOTHING UNUSUAL REMAINED IN THE POSITION FROM THE REVERSE WAS TRUE.

The text in the document is as follows:

Report of Unidentified Objects

Sighted in Neighborhood of Rawlins on July 15, 1958.
(per U.S.A.F. Headquarters Wire of July 15)

These objects were quite possibly meteorites or meteors, descending in a somewhat different and more or less erratic course than would be expected of meteors. They were observed by several people and while it would be impossible to determine their exact nature, they were certainly not within the bounds of possibility.

Their varied and erratic movements and disappearance from direct vision seem to indicate something more than ordinary meteoritic activity. Their varied and erratic movements and disappearance from direct vision seem to indicate something more than ordinary meteoritic activity.

To may be interesting to note that we have three other reports of somewhat similar unidentified objects as follows:

Las Cruces, N.M. - July 25 - 08 27 U.T.
Grandy, Colorado - August 1 - 08 26 U.T.
Lochlort, Wyoming - August 1 - 08 32 U.T.

Color was not mentioned in the Las Cruces case. The objects sighted in this case were about the size of a regulation football and traveling in a more or less easterly direction. All were traveling in a more or less easterly direction.

Transcription of the text in the document:

FRIDAY, AUGUST 8, 1958 - THE DAYTON DAILY NEWS

Boom, Balloons Mystify Utah Residents

SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 8 - Some observers thought they saw heavenly planes and objects like balloons high in the sky. They were called "odd-smelling gas." They landed at Dugway Proving Ground and near Salt Lake City as unidentified objects, and many residents ran outside to see what caused the blast noise.
He said he saw no connection between the boom and the balloons. He considered them unrelated incidents.

PAGE 3

The balloons were not identified immediately. The weather balloons are filled with helium or hot air, which has an odor.
As for the boom, the Strategic Air Command at Omaha said it had no planes or missiles in that area at the time of the explosion. The Pentagon had no operational missile units in the Utah area.
The balloons, of clear plastic, were about four feet long and 18 inches in diameter. They carried no markings or instruments.
An Air National Guard unit in Southern California and New Mexico - said there was no missile firing during yesterday.
The balloons caused a stir. Some people thought they saw planes, but they did not resemble any known aircraft. The noise was described as a "sonic boom," a violent explosion sound caused by any object traveling faster than sound.

NO CASE(INFORMATION ONLY)                                         8 AUG 1958
BURONS AIRES

We will be gt vying the testimony and information contained in Mr. Arcbibald Lirick of nn official of the Provincial Senate of the Province of Buenos Aires in reference to the alleged sighting of a UFO over the area of Rawlins and Rock Springs, Wyoming, on 6 August 1958.

According to the witness, who was traveling from Rawlins to Rock Springs on the evening of 6 August 1955, he first observed the object at approximately 7:57 p.m. The witness stated that the object was first noticed as a bright light in the sky flying at a high speed. As the object approached the witness, he noticed that it was a circular-shaped craft, approximately 60 to 80 feet in diameter, and that it was emitting a reddish glow. The witness further stated that the object moved in a straight line and then made a sharp 90-degree turn, continuing on in the same manner. The witness reported that the object then appeared to stop completely, hovering for a few moments, before resuming its straight-line flight and disappearing from sight.

The witness reported that he was driving his automobile at the time of the sighting and that he immediately stopped his car to observe the object more closely. The witness stated that he was at a distance of approximately 300 to 400 meters from the object when he first observed it. The witness further reported that the object made no sound and that there was no trail or exhaust visible. The witness stated that the object was visible for approximately two to three minutes.

INF. ONLY ALAMOGARDO, NEW MEXICO 8 AUG 1956
FLYING SAUCERS' FORMED CLUSTER, OBSERVERS SAY
Alamogardo, N.M. (UPI) - A group of unidentified flying objects "clustered like a star" and hovered for more than an hour near there Friday night and then suddenly "broke apart and disappeared," witnesses said yesterday.
A spokesman for the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization said a total of nine persons had reported seeing the mysterious objects.
A check of nearby military bases, airports and the United States Weather Bureau disclosed that there were no jets or weather balloons aloft at or near the time of the sightings, between 10:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., filter center director L. J. Lorenzen said.
An employee of the Alamogardo school system, Isaac Carswell, told the filter center that he "couldn't believe what I was seeing. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself."

Gentlemen -
I saw an object that appeared to be circular in shape and hovered over the town of Greenwood, South Carolina for about 10-15 minutes on the night of August 8, 1958.
This object was luminous and seemed to have a light source within it. It made no sound and did not appear to move, just hovered in the same spot.
I was coming home from work that night around 10:30 p.m. and happened to glance up and saw this unusual object in the sky. It was clearly visible and I watched it for the entire time it was in sight.
It seemed to be about the size of a car and was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. The weather was clear and there was no moon that night.
I have never seen anything like this before and was quite startled by it. I would be interested in any information you may have concerning this incident.
Yours truly,
(Signature)
