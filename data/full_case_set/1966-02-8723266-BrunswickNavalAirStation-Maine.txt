The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically record 10073, which describes an observation made on February 16, 1966 at the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine.

The text in the report is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 16 February 66 16/2335Z  
2. LOCATION: Brunswick Naval Air Station, Maine
3. SOURCE: Civilian & Military
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 1/2 hours
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: The course was observed to hover, quick start, and hover again.
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Astro (JUPITER) 2. INSUFFICIENT DATA

The report provides details about the observation, including the duration, type of observation, and the conclusions drawn from the incident. It indicates that the objects observed were likely the planet Jupiter, but that there was insufficient data to make a definitive determination.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document from Project Blue Book. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes  it disappeared suddenly.  
Object  (White light)  Color  Grayish metal  Shape  Seemed to be 30 to 40 feet long. Then it seems to have completely disappeared. 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: and UFO smooth passage sound
b. Color: Grayish metal

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
Object would have covered at least Ten times the match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object(s) such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

1st UFO - hat not see clearly, only said a light. 2nd UFO - looked like object took off like a shot going out of sight about 3 miles.

21. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was? The UFO seemed rather large, maybe several hundred feet away.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch and diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows a curved line with labeled points, and a compass rose diagram. The text describes instructions for using the diagram to illustrate the motion and location of an unidentified object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90°  75°
  60°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there are MORE PHOTOGRAPHS, please indicate how many were there.

The text also mentions that the person observed a "UFO sighting" and drew a picture to show the direction of travel.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The letter is addressed to someone in Auburn, Maine and appears to be a response to a reported UFO observation on February 15, 1966. The letter states that the information provided was not sufficient for evaluation, and thanks the observer for reporting their observation.

Text from the document:
