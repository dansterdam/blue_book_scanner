The description of the flight path and maneuvers during the 3 hour and 15 minutes observation were made. This data would allow a meaningful evaluation to be made. However, the description as "ragged," "erratic," and made flight maneuvers not compatible with aircraft so-called "bubbles" in the atmosphere which could cause a radar reflection, and consequently might cause a visual observation as well. Such a "bubble" phenomenon, as suggested by personnel at the Winnemucca radar site.
