FROM ASST. NAVAL ATTACHE, HAMBURG

SUBJECT: FEDERAL REPUBLIC - Unknown object falling in vicinity of Hamburg

BRIEF (FOR REPORTS OF * THAN ONE PAGE, ENTER CAREFUL SUMMARY) Encl: (1) Translation of ltr from Professor Dr.  of 6 Dec 1957

1. On 1 December 1957 about 1630 (GCT) a burning object was observed to fall in the vicinity of Hamburg. This object has been determined to be definitely non-meteoritic. Source investigated the incident. The following information was obtained in personal interview and through correspondence (enclosure (1)) with source.

2. Source has stated as follows:

a. That a brightly burning object was seen to fall in the vicinity of Hamburg several persons observed this incident at least one of whom is known to be a responsible person.

h. That this object struck the earth at an angle of about 30* above the horizontal.

c. That the point of impact was 8" - 10" in diameter and about 1½" deep. The point of impact is located in a very swampy lowland and water below surface spoil complicated recovery operations.

d. That the grass in the v icinity of point of impact was singed and covered with a white-gray-oxide residue.

e. That no actual metallic pieces were recovered - only products of combustion.

f. That analysis of residue (see enclosure (s) revealed magnesium and aluminum oxides with the former predominant in quantity.

DATE

18 December 1957

3. Source Information: Source is Professor Doctor ---, ------, University of Hamburg. Source was very cooperative as well as objective in respect to this incident. His final conclusions are limited to the opinion that this object was not a meteor but was something constructed by man for some purpose which is not known.

Prepared Officer's Comment: Rather extensive digging operations were conducted at site by German Army Engineers - a hole about ten feet deep with expanded radius was dug, the earth sifted and no metal discovered. The theory that this object was a ship's signal device has been suggested, however the nearest ship ---- could have been no closer to point of impact than one and one half miles, which would seem to negate the idea that a ship was the point of origin. The hole has been refilled and the incident is considered closed by local authorities.
