Larry- Think the following will suffice for an answer here:
"The sample you submitted in your letter of 13 October is 'that', made of aluminum foil. It is used by the Air Force in training for defense against enemy radar, when dropped from an aircraft at specified air speeds and frequencies found in areas of the US where such training is conducted."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, dated October 14, 1958.

The text in the document is as follows:

Mansfield, Ohio
October 14, 1958

Air Technical Intelligence Center,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I am inclosing a small portion of a large amount of material that apparently fell from the skies in northern Ohio. There is evidence that this could not have dropped from any means of aerial transportation.

My friends, who have sent this to me, asked me for an explanation, and I am forwarding some of the material to you for your evaluation. I have only specializations that would give them the ability to give them the facts.

Certainly, I will appreciate your comments and results of your examinations.

Sincerely and respectfully,
[Signature redacted]

Dear Mr. **********,
Your letter of 13 October 1958 addressed to Air Technical Intelligence Center has been referred to this office for reply.
The sample you submitted in your letter is "chaff" made of aluminum foil. It is used by the Air Force in training for defense against enemy radar. When dropped from an aircraft it affects and confuses radar. It is frequently found in areas of the United States where military training is conducted.
Thank you for your interest in this matter.
Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Technical Capabilities Division
Office of Information Services
Mr. ********** 
Mansfield, Ohio
