INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

Briefly, this was another UFO phenomenon, the time of arrival was about 3:15 A.M., There were two circles of lights, the diameter of the outer circle was 3 to 4 feet when it first appeared and about 3 inches when it left. There was a steady, bright, orangey-red light in the center. The lights were plainly visible and lit up the whole area so that I could see the scenery as in daylight. The lights were motionless for an instant, then began moving slowly across the sky, rapidly accelerating as they moved, going in a south-east direction. They were gone in a few seconds. I was shocked, that this thing happened right over me, it was so close, at an estimated altitude of about 100 feet. At the time it was in full view, there was not a cloud in the sky, and the stars were very light - so light in fact that one could read a newspaper by that light alone. It looked about twice the size of a large star, and appeared to be just above the trees. This was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any conventional craft. It had no sound, no wings, and was shaped like a globe or two saucers facing each other. There was no indication that the lights were separate vehicles-they appeared as a single unit. This occurred on a north-south highway in a very open, flat area. There are no lights or buildings for miles in any direction, so I am certain it was not a reflection or any earthly source.

There is a hand-drawn sketch in the image that appears to show three silhouetted bird-like shapes. The text at the bottom of the image states "Cincinnati Ohio 45231".

next to me with a clock on the wall and this time the first thing I want to mention is the time and the last thing also. as I mentioned awhile ego I had a red truck with a big fender and it was blue-color. I was going to the grocery store and just past here I didn't pay too much attention to the ground at all.

Thank you.

Text extracted from the document:

To whom it may concern,

On the night of Nov. 7, 1957, we were returning from a store to our home. As we were crossing Wooster Pike we observed a very bright, glowing object in the sky, about 10 to 12 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be about the size of a basketball.

It was hovering and seemed stationary. After observing it from the car for about 30 seconds, I left the car to get a better view. As I approached it, the object began to move. It proceeded to go in an easterly direction and appeared to go behind some trees. I ran after it but could not keep it in sight. It was a little over 3 minutes before I lost sight of it. I then returned to the car and we proceeded to our home, a distance of about 5 minutes drive. It was a little over 7:30 p.m. when we observed this object.

It was a clear night, no clouds, and the object was well defined. It seemed to give off a pulsating light, increasing in intensity and then diminishing, not a steady, constant light. My wife and I both observed this object and we are both certain that it was not any known type of aircraft. We thought at first it might be a satellite, but the movement and the fluctuating light pattern eliminated that possibility.

We are sincere in our report and believe that this sighting may be of interest to your investigation. We would be glad to answer any further questions you may have.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten diagram and text. The diagram shows a sketch of an object with some annotations. The text describes the diagram and mentions that it "shows the outline of my neighbor's movement and confirms my past observation of the same objects as were seen again on Thanksgiving night this last Thursday".

Text extracted from the document:

It looked a giant 5 or 6 times larger than a star as a gigantic disc of metal that it could not move a rattler.

This diagram shows the outline of my neighbor's movement and confirms my past observation of the same objects as were seen again on Thanksgiving night this last Thursday.

Thank you.

The image contains a photograph of a diagram or sketch. The diagram appears to be a drawing of an angular object in the sky from the perspective of an observer. The diagram includes angular measurements and labels such as "OBSERVER" and "OBJECT", suggesting this is a technical illustration related to a UFO sighting.
