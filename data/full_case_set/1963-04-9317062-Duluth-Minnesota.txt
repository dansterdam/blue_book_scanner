INVESTIGATION REPORT

INTRODUCTION

The incident involved in this report was reported by Mr. James H. Nichols, a reputable businessman in Duluth, Minnesota. On the date of the incident, Mr. Nichols was traveling on Highway 53 northwest of Duluth, Minnesota, when he observed an unidentified flying object.

On April 9, 1963, at approximately 8:34 PM, Mr. Nichols was driving his automobile in a northbound direction on Highway 53 approximately 15 miles northwest of Duluth, Minnesota. The weather at the time was clear and the visibility was excellent.

As Mr. Nichols was driving, he observed a bright light in the sky to the north, which appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and appeared to be oval in shape. Mr. Nichols estimated the object to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet.

Mr. Nichols stopped his automobile on the highway and observed the object for several minutes. During this time, the object made a sudden 90 degree turn to the west and accelerated to a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight within a few seconds.

After observing the object, Mr. Nichols immediately contacted the Duluth Air Force Base to report the incident. He was advised that the object he had observed was not a known aircraft and was being investigated.

CONCLUSION

Based on the information provided by Mr. Nichols, it appears that he observed an unidentified flying object. The object's high rate of speed, sudden change in direction, and disappearance from sight are all characteristics consistent with reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. While the nature and origin of the object remain unknown, the report provides a credible account of an unusual aerial observation.
