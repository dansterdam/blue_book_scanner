The following is a report of an unidentified flying object observed from Honshu, Japan:

On 22 January 1953, at approximately 0600 hours, a silver, circular object was observed in the sky over Honshu, Japan. The object was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and was traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated at over 1,000 miles per hour. The object was observed for approximately 15 seconds before disappearing from sight. No vapor trail or exhaust was visible. Although the object was very bright, no sound was heard by the observer.

The observer, Major Paul C. Taylor, USAF, stated that he was unable to identify the object, and that it did not resemble any known aircraft. He further stated that the object moved with a smooth, gliding motion and followed no discernible pattern or course.

9 Nov 1952 ATIC 25271-T:
1. The object reportedly observed over Honshu, Japan on 31 Oct 1952 has been the subject of a previous intelligence report (L-33). The information contained in this report is amplified and clarified as follows:

2. The object was observed by numerous Japanese citizens, airline and military pilots, and Korean security personnel on the night of 31 Oct 1952. Statements indicate that the object was of large size, approximately 50 to 100 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright light or glow.
The object was observed over Honshu for approximately 30 minutes before disappearing at high speed.
3. The object did not resemble conventional aircraft and no similar objects have been reported in the past by observers in this area.
Its peculiar characteristics and manner of flight indicate this object to be of unusual nature. Further investigation would be necessary to determine the actual nature of the object.
