The text in the document is as follows:

"Such Goin's On Scare Me"
100-Foot Balloon Shot To 250-Mile Altitude
From Wire Dispatches
WALLOPS ISLAND, Va. Oct. 28 - Space scientists shot a 100-foot balloon to an altitude of 250 miles over the Atlantic Ocean about dawn today. The big inflatable sphere, which was created by the National Aeronautical and Space Administration, was launched from South Carolina to Maine.
The launching was a test of the inflatible satellites experimentation, as reflectors of radio and radar beams in space. 
The national aeronautical and space administration (NASA) said the experiment achieved its aim of testing the functioning and inflation machinery.
The two-stage balloon, filled with a solid propellant rocket, was launched to an altitude of about 250 miles. The sphere, as painted, poured out a bright vapor trail in the pre-dawn sky, which was visible from radio and police headquarters for miles.
"The craziest thing in the world," said Dr. Robert Jastrow, the launching director at the satellite center in New Haven, Conn., who tracked the object with his telescope. "It was."
An elderly unidentified lady bureau said "such goin's on scare me, it surely does." At takeoff, the inflatable balloon was carried by a 35-ton rocket container only 8 inches in diameter. After its inflation, it measured some 100 feet. So large it would barely fit in some buildings. It weighed only about 300 pounds.
The first stage consisting of a rocket case with small solid-prorpellant booster, weighing about 10 pounds, was used to carry the balloon from its launching pad to an altitude of about 20 miles. The second stage was an Atlas ballistic missile without warhead, which later will serve as a third stage for the Delta satellite launcher. This powered the vehicle.
The sphere was made of military laminated acrylic plastic and its thickness was about thousands of an inch thick.
It was visible for about 10 minutes. NASA said it was unable to determine at once how the inflation was completed when it was separated from the rocket about 250 miles over the Atlantic. Its peak altitude was 232 statute miles.
The inflation was completed when the sphere was already deep in the upper atmosphere, begun by residual air inside it. After inflation was completed when from two plastic bags, vapored, fully inflating the 100-foot sphere.

HUGE SPACE BALLOON PAYS TECHNICIANS 
INFLATED 350 MILES ABOVE EARTH

Big Balloon 
Spectacular
Thing to See

WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 --The United States succeeded in the space program by sending up a huge balloon to the highest altitude ever reached for a high altitude scientific observation. The balloon, 100 feet in diameter, was the biggest ever inflated in the fringe of space. But it made an unscheduled landing from a record-high altitude of over 350 miles when high-altitude winds and space administration difficulties forced the balloon to break up and the gondola and instruments to descend out of hundreds of miles of space on the Eastern seaboard.

CIVIL DEFENSE OFFICER 
Quarters taken by officer quarters C..A.P. for two men. 
This contains a package located which was suspended from a balloon. At that altitude the balloon could not be seen from the ground, and the following notes are contained on a paper inside the package: 
It contains a pocket with an instrument or instruments, the nature of which is unknown. Inside the package is a fold up nylon balloon, a small container and all weighs 120 pounds. 
The package is aluminum outside with white aluminum inside. After the balloon was released it began to expand (length four feet) and at that altitude the balloon contained 80 cubic feet of gas. This balloon carried no identification and no instructions.

ALL ISLAND ISLAND 26 OCT 1959 (UNID) ALIEN SIGHTS OVER OHIO. OCTOBER 23, 1959, DAYTON, OHIO - AIRCRAFT INDUSTRIES RELEASE: A SILVERY SPHERICAL OBJECT ABOUT 50 FEET IN DIAMETER WAS OBSERVED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES OVER DAYTON, OHIO ON OCTOBER 23, 1959. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN BY SEVERAL PERSONS EMPLOYED AT THE NATIONAL CASH REGISTER COMPANY PLANT.
THE SPACE AGENCY SAID THE EXPERIMENT ACHIEVED ITS AIM OF TRACKING THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. DATA ON ITS PERFORMANCE WAS RADIOED BACK TO EARTH. THE BALLOON WAS EJECTED AFTER PHOTOGRAPHING THE OBJECT. THRUST PRODUCED 150,000 POUNDS OF FORCE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO ITS HIGH VELOCITY.
WITNESSES DIFFERED WIDELY IN DESCRIBING THE OBJECT. SOME SAID IT LOOKED METALLIC, WHILE OTHERS DESCRIBED IT AS HAVING NO EXTERNAL FEATURES. THE GOVERNMENT HOPES TO PUT ON A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT VERY SOON.
THE OBJECT WAS A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC INTEREST. NATIONAL CASH REGISTER REPORTS A RUN ON BINOCULARS AND CAMERAS FROM DAYTON AREA RESIDENTS WANTING TO VIEW THE STRANGE VISITOR FROM THE SKIES.
TAKE-OFF OF THIS BALLOON IS THE LARGEST EVER CONDUCTED BY THE US SPACE AGENCY. IT WAS OBSERVED BY MANY PERSONS WITHIN A 50 MILE RADIUS OF DAYTON. THE OBJECT LANDED ABOUT 70 MILES FROM THE BIG CITY BUILDING.

The image contains a photograph of a "day lead balloon" which appears to be the subject of a report. The text in the document discusses the characteristics and behavior of this balloon, including that it was tracked by radar and telescopes, and that it crumpled into a 30-inch container after reaching high altitudes. The text also mentions that such balloons could be used for scientific research purposes, but discusses concerns about their size and low weight.

WASHINGTON, OCT. 30--(UP)--PUZZLED SCIENTISTS SOUGHT AN EXPLANATION TODAY FOR A STRANGE BALLOON LAUNCHED HERE SATURDAY NIGHT.

THE BALLOON, ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER, WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING SPOTTED ABOUT 9,000 FEET ABOVE THE DISTRICT SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT SUNDAY. IT THEN ROSE AT A STEADY RATE TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 60,000 FEET.

ACCORDING TO REPORTS, THE BALLOON WAS TRACKED BY RADAR AND TELESCOPES AND WAS OBSERVED TO CRUMPLE INTO A 30-INCH CONTAINER.

THE TEST, PRONOUNCED A COMPLETE SUCCESS, PAVES THE WAY FOR AN ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH A SIMILAR BALLOON AT CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., ON MONDAY. 

SUCH SATELLITE SCIENTISTS SAY SHOULD MAKE AN IDEAL REFLECTOR FOR USE IN LONG-DERANGE COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE OF ITS LARGE SIZE AND LOW WEIGHT. ABOUT 15 POUNDS, THE BALLOON ALSO COULD BE USEFUL IN STUDYING THE CONDITION OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

HOWEVER, THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF WHETHER SUCH BALLOONS, SHOT UP TO 60,000 FEET, COULD WITHSTAND THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE. THIS WOULD BE DETERMINED IN THE TEST.

The image does not contain any photographs or images. It is a page from a document that appears to be discussing a total solar eclipse occurring on October 2, 1959. The page contains detailed text describing the eclipse, including when and where it will be visible, as well as a star chart showing the positions of various celestial bodies around the time of the eclipse.

ASTRONOMY

TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE COMING

A total solar eclipse, taking place on Oct. 2, is a high-
light of the astronomical year. It will be visible in part of the
United States and Canada.

BY JAMES STOKLEY

THE MAIN FEATURE on the astronomical
program for October is the first total solar eclipse
visible in the United States and Canada since 1954
and the last until 1963. This eclipse will be total
only for a narrow strip of land extending from the
eastern shores of southern Alaska approximately from
eastern Canada to Florida. The belt of maximum
eclipse, where the moon completely blocks out the sun, will be
only about 60 miles wide.

But the eclipse will be visible as a partial one over a much
larger area, as the moon passes between the earth and sun. This
will be the case in the rest of Alaska, northern Canada, most of the
states, and southern parts of Canada. The eclipse will be seen in
eastern parts of the United States and in Maritime Provinces and
Newfoundland shortly after sunrise, as the eclipse begins. And in
the far western states, it will be visible as the eclipse is ending.

MANY PECULIAR effects are observed during a total eclipse. As
the moon's dark shadow sweeps across the earth, birds and other
animals may become confused, and even start going through their
nighttime routines. The sudden dark may cause some to think that
night is approaching and to take proper nighttime actions.

The air temperature drops several degrees, and there is a general
feeling of gloom and apprehension. For just as the eclipse reaches
its maximum, the sky becomes as dark as on a moonless night, ex-
cept for the glow of the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, which
becomes visible. Around the edge, the "sunset" colors of the chromo-
sphere, the next layer below the corona, may also be glimpsed.

Stars and planets that are normally invisible in the daytime glare
of the sun can be seen quite plainly. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter
and Saturn will be visible, as well as some of the brighter stars.

BUT THE CORONA is the main attraction. It is a halo of silvery-
white light surrounding the sun, at first mostly in the form of long
streamers, but toward the end of totality tending to become more
circular. Prominences, or flamelike projections from the sun's surface,
may be seen during the brief moments when the moon's shadow
covers the surface.

The whole phenomenon lasts less than 30 seconds in areas of
maximum eclipse. During the eclipse, the total area over which the
shadow sweeps is elongated from east to west. It is about 10,000
miles long and from 60 to 150 miles wide.

JUPITER AND SATURN, the two largest planet, will be visible
both before and after the eclipse. They are on the same side of the
sun, and Jupiter is the brighter of the two. Look for them rising in
the east about three hours before the sun.

Referring again to the total eclipse, it is important to caution that
one should never look directly at the sun, except during the brief
moments of totality, when the moon's shadow covers the sun's surface.
Even then, one should avoid looking, as the sun's light is still much
too bright. A total eclipse, however, offers an opportunity to observe
the sun's corona and other rare phenomena associated with solar
eclipses.

But when the total eclipse is over, the sun will gradually become
brighter and brighter, and will continue to shine in all its usual bright-
ness throughout the rest of the day.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes multiple UFO sightings in the New Guinea area. The text in the document is as follows:

MORE SIGHTINGS IN NEW GUINEA AREA
Several sightings of unidentified flying objects have been reported in the Mt. Hagen area, including sightings by Peter S. Norris and others.
Observations of Unidentified Flying Objects
On September 16, 1959 between 5:15 and 5:30 p.m. Mirish ARAGAP, Reggie Mirarin, Anthony ARAGAP, and Timothy ARAGAPA Witness observation from near Mt. Giluwe, dist. Weetebula, Engl. N.E.I. (Papua) M.B.D. of Mt. Giluwe Range, country is about 5 miles in length over which the object moved. The object was first sighted when it appeared over the mountain at an elevation of about 40 degrees, suddenly diving down rapidly and closely approaching the mountain, but when it reached the vicinity of Mt. Giluwe it suddenly stopped and remained stationary for a long time (about 1 hour), the observers had no time to time it accurately. The object appeared to the naked eye to be brilliantly illuminated and seemed almost to touch the top of the mountain. It then hovered stationary for a long time (an hour), the observers had no time to time it accurately. The object appeared to the naked eye to be brilliantly illuminated and seemed almost to touch the top of the mountain. It then hovered stationary for a long time (about 1 hour) the observer had no time to time it accurately. When it finally moved away, it accelerated rapidly and disappeared in the direction of the coastline, travelling over the mountain. 
The appearance of the light was round a disc or a sphere. It was dazzlingly brilliant, the colour changing continuously, the hues being green, red and yellow at various times of the period of observation. The colours changed about every three minutes. (This seems quite uncommon, but the reference that it was about equal to the size of the moon, but was brilliant, leads one to suspect it was actually much smaller and closer. As it was an observation through the low atmosphere, local atmospheric and optical effects would tend to enhance the apparent size and brilliance.)
Other witnesses: Anastasia MIRAH's son, Wm John Mirah, Station Assistant, and others unnamed.

The image does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text describes an incident on October 23, 1959 in Los Angeles, California where a bright object was seen streaking across the sky, causing police and sheriff departments to receive calls from residents. The object was reported to have a greenish-white light before disappearing over the horizons, and a federal aviation agency spokesman was quoted commenting on the event.

23 October 1959
Los Angeles, California

A METEOR STREAKED ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAST NIGHT, CAUSING HUNDREDS OF CALLS TO POLICE AND SHERIFF DEPARTMENTS FROM SAN DIEGO TO SANTA BARBARA.  ABOUT 250 MILES APART--REPORTED RECEIVING CALLS FROM RESIDENTS WHO SPOTTED THE BRIGHT OBJECT FLASHING ACROSS THE HORIZONS. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A GREENISH-WHITE LIGHT BEFORE DISAPPEARING.  A FEDERAL AVIATION AGENCY SPOKESMAN SAID THE OBJECT WAS A LARGE METEOR BURNING UP IN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 28 OCTOBER 59
NEAR HONG KONG
CHINA

Your letter - 
My husband and I would appreciate very much further information in Headquarters flying saucer. The news reporting of it sounds very disturbing to us.

Reguests to OUSAF information on niggers or questions as to their identification are very disconcerting. For this reason I have held from reporting an unusual sighting on October 28, 1957. The incident occurred near Hong Kong, China. My husband and I regretfully felt it best to disregard the sighting and not dispatch any further information. Please advise us as to a proper procedure for reporting unusual sightings if you consider this report of possible interest.

Thank you.

As the time of my husband's sighting was among the U.S. Navy and a limited number of civilian witnesses, I would appreciate his name not being further disclosed. Please reply to a post office box number if you have any questions or require additional information. The incident information is factual.
