PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 12/0030Z
2. LOCATION: Omaha, Nebraska
10. CONCLUSION: Probable: AIRCRAFT
11. CHIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The officer on duty was attracted to several slow moving lights in the sky shortly after midnight. When nearly overhead, the lights seemed to pause momentarily, then moved off to the northwest. Several other persons witnessed the sane slow moving lighted objects. The description and activity of the objects would indicate that they were aircraft, possibly aircraft equipped with landing lights, rather than UFO's. The actions and course of the objects were similar to those sometimes seen with aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions. The witnesses did not interpret the incident as a sighting of a true UFO, nor do the available facts indicate that this was a case of such a sighting.

Text from the document:

"As interviewed both boys separately, I allowed each to tell his story without questioning until he was through. The questions of both boys and their answers were the same.

On a country road near Hooper (5 miles SE of Hooper), the two boys sa a country road near Harri's junk yard. They were looking at the headlights of a car on the hill. They believed it was a car at first but as they watched, the object rose up from behind the hill obscures the valley from view. At first they did not remember seeing it as they did not see it again. 

It is only later as the hill line, they do not remember more than a few seconds. It appeared as two bright lights in the distance and gradually became illuminated by these white lights in the front and two red lights in the center, and soon the entire object was dark until the time and then again appeared to lift off the ground.

To ground disturbance, noise, or smell was detected. The object was dark until that time and then again appeared to lift off the ground.

After approximately three minutes it accelerated rapidly upward and disappeared in the direction of the city of Omaha.

The boys were 13 years old and were out driving around on Saturday night in hopes of seeing the main bus, but it was not seen. The boys were interviewed by Sgt. Kenneth L. Godfroy, USAF, Information Division."

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 11 July 1963

TO: PID (ATDT-Lt Morano)

1. No known aircraft were flying in the area at the time of the sighting according to the local airport controller. Runway lights and control tower appeared normal. At approximately 10:30, by landing on runway 15 this would mean that the aircraft was still approximately 15 miles southwest of the sighting location. There were no airborne aircraft in the vicinity during this time frame.
2. There are only two reports in the vicinity of the sighting. Milliken Air Field had no knowledge of any aircraft, nor did the Lincoln Control Center.
3. I visited the alleged sighting and no one there had seen or heard of anything unusual. There are no reports of the same or similar "lights" from any other source. All persons interviewed were normal and none showed evidence of being affected or disturbed by the usual bright light aircraft style, both high wing and low wing type, illumination.
4. I contacted the Omaha Radar Approach Control facility and there were no unidentified targets on their scopes at the time specified.

The image shared does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from what looks like a Project Blue Book document, containing handwritten text.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text found in the document:

That time of the night was a little after 12:30 and we saw what appeared to be an object in the sky. At first it looked like a plane but this was no plane. It was large and oval shaped and had a brilliant white light in the center. The light was so bright it was difficult to look directly at it. At times it seemed to pulse or fluctuate in intensity. 

We watched it for about 15 to 20 minutes. During that time it did not appear to be moving very much, if at all. It seemed to hover in one spot. Then suddenly it just took off at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight.

We could not judge its size or how far away it was. But it was certainly no conventional aircraft that we are familiar with. The brilliant white light in the center was very distinctive and unlike any aircraft lights we have seen.

We were coming down Dodge Street at about 12:30 and glanced up and saw this object in the sky. It was hovering there and seemed to be several hundred feet up in the air. At first I thought it was a plane, but as I got a better look at it, I realized it was something very unusual.

It was oval shaped and had a brilliant white light in the center that seemed to pulse or fluctuate in intensity at times. The light was so bright it was almost painful to look at directly.

We watched it for around 15 to 20 minutes and during that time it did not appear to move very much, if at all. It just seemed to hover in one spot. Then suddenly, without any warning, it just took off at an incredible speed and disappeared from sight.

I have no idea what it could have been. It was definitely not an aircraft of any kind that I am familiar with. The shape, the brilliant pulsing white light, and the tremendous speed it attained when it took off all point to it being some kind of unusual, unidentified flying object.

The image contains no photograph, only handwritten text. I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

Was there any other sounds you at the time?
Un-ham we were as concerned it would completely rule out, sight.
How many people did you tell about this? 
Well, many people did we tell about it, and it seemed to southeast and his field, and so we went back into woods straight away, and took along a watch, hoping to keep up with it, but it remained for a while then suddenly disappear, apparently.
We were shining the light on it, and it didn't seem to be affected by the light, or anything, and it suddenly just shot off to the front like a light, and then come some more lights, underneath and suddenly it was gone, we saw a little bit, but there was nothing we could see, and so we headed back. 
Well that's how we get hold of it, most likely. Now, is there anything else you can tell me about?
Well, I can't tell you much else, because that's all we did, we just watched it for a while, and we could see it move around, and it would stop, and it didn't seem to be affected by the light, what direction it was going, but it was just sitting there, and then it just took off. And we well, that's the best we can tell you.
Some strange lights, and we could see it for a while, and after a mile or so, it just suddenly disappeared.

Form report of sightings:
July 12, 1968

Objects were sighted for several minutes. They moved away from one another and then back towards each other. The objects appeared to be elongated or elliptical in shape. When you first see them, they looked like two cigar-shaped objects and they were also moving very fast. I did say approximately two, when we first got this, because they did come up closer to it, or up to it, and then they went back and started moving away from each other again. Well, when we first got there, we just got out in time to see them. I know they were there, because we were driving along, and we pulled off to the side of the road to get a better look. At first, it looked like they were coming straight toward us. But they started moving away from each other, and then they moved back together, and then they would move apart again. The moving apart, I'd say roughly, was about a mile. At least a mile apart from each other. And when they came back together, I'd say approximately two city blocks. It was just an extremely fast movement. They didn't appear to just be stationary. They were definitely moving. And it was up above the treetops, I'd say maybe 1,000 to 1,500 feet in the air. But they stayed together as a group, you know. They didn't go off in separate directions or anything. They just kind of moved around each other for those several minutes. Then, all of a sudden, they just took off straight up and disappeared. I don't know where they went. I don't know what they were. I can't explain them. Let's just say they were unidentified. I pretend you are an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document with handwritten notes and redactions. The text in the document appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book, dated 1968-07-7200627 and originating from Omaha, Nebraska.

As requested, I will now produce all the text found in the document:

What you are looking at is a strange thing in the sky. It was dark, and the object appeared to be larger than an automobile. It seemed to be over 500 feet above the ground, and was moving in a straight line. It was going faster than any airplane that I've ever seen. I saw this object for about 4 or 5 minutes. It seemed to have a red light on the front and a blue light on the back. Then it just seemed to disappear in the distance.

How far away was it when you first saw it? I would say it was at least 1/2 mile away from where I was standing. Do you want to know how high it seemed to be? Well, it was up in the air, I'd say it was over 500 feet high. It was going across the sky, and it was going much faster than any plane I've ever seen. I'd say it was really moving, just streaking across the sky.

What did it look like? Well, it was dark, but it seemed to be larger than a car. And it had a red light on the front and a blue light on the back. It just seemed to disappear in the distance, it didn't do anything fancy, it just kept going straight and then it was gone.

How long did you see it? Well, I'd say I saw it for 4 or 5 minutes, maybe a little less. I was just standing there watching it go across the sky. It was really moving fast, faster than any plane I've ever seen. Just streaking across the sky.

Did you hear any sound from it? No, I didn't hear any sound at all. It was just moving silently across the sky. Didn't make any noise that I could hear.

What were the weather conditions like at the time? It was a clear night, no clouds in the sky. Just a dark night, that's all.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Page 5
This is where the trail started. It was 10:35 at night. The moon was bright. The object was oblong in shape and was about 15-20 feet long. It was flying at a high rate of speed at an estimated 1000-1500 feet altitude. It slanted down and then up again and was white in color. It made no sound whatsoever. I watched it for about 10-15 seconds and then it was gone. There was no fire or tail visible. It couldn't have been a plane, helicopter or anything else we are accustomed to seeing in the sky. This is why I say it was a UFO. I did not report this incident to anyone at the time. It didn't seem important enough. But now that I've heard about the Air Force's Project Blue Book, I am wondering if I should have reported it. If you can shed any light on what I might have seen, please let me know. I'd be very interested to find out. Thank you for your consideration.

1. Reference is made to your letter of 20 July 68 in which you requested examination of a UFO sighting report. 

2. Performed the UFO sighting or 27 June 68 and determined the following:

a. The object was observed in the sky around 2100 hours by a witness near Omaha, Nebraska. The object was described as round, reddish-orange in color, and moving rapidly across the sky.

b. The witness did not take any photographs of the object.

3. Advising that the witness observations do not warrant further investigation at this time. The sighting appears to be a natural phenomenon such as a meteor or a satellite re-entry.
