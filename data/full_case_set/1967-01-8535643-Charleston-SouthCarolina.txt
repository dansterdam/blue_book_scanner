The text of the document is as follows:

"Excerpt for the Record: 23 Jan 67

Contact was made with Lt. Paul Jones, Ft. Lee APS, Virginia in regards to the submitted information. The objects were visually picked up on one LRN-93 radar. Although there appeared to confirm the time the pilot reported seeing the object, only one object was visually sighted. The pilot stated he did not believe this to be the object he had reported earlier.

The ground observer did not get a good look at the object. The ground observer around the area was reverted picking up the object. Lt. Jones was asked if a true radar return was obtained to which he stated it was not. He said the objects in the air were most likely birds. He maintained the F-103 aircraft was in the area at the time and although the pilot reported nothing on the craft at the time the sighting however, the pilot reported nothing.

2 March 67

Lt. Paul Jones called to provide additional information in regards to the radar sightings. The Jones was informed by the Charleston, S.C. that the radar prints were not of UFOs. A check of the conditions was learned that the individual monitoring the radar set had the gain on the height finder turned up to the high sensitivity. This caused the appearance of a lot of ground returns. The prints on the radar were determined to be this interference. The personnel turned down the gain on 2-23-67 again and picked up more UFOs when the gain was turned down the UFOs disappeared."
