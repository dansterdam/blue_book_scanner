DEAR SIR:
On November 1, 1957, Lester Scott, Chief Supervisor of Protection, Lake City Arsenal, Lake City, Missouri, advised he has been brought to his attention that [REDACTED] who resides on [REDACTED], Blue Springs, Missouri, saw an unidentified flying object near the Pink Hill Grocery store south of Lake City Arsenal about 1 a.m., November 2, 1957.

[REDACTED] wife related the story of her husband's observation to Mr. Scott, an employee at Lake City Arsenal, and stated that her husband did not intend to report his observations because no one would believe him.

Allegedly, [REDACTED] was driving his automobile from his place of employment, somewhere in Kansas City area, to his home when he observed the unidentified object hovering about fifty feet off the ground. The object was oval in shape. As [REDACTED] approached the object, the engine of his automobile died and would not function again until the object moved on.

No additional inquiry or investigation is being conducted concerning this matter by this office.
