UNITED STATES AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFOB)
REPORTING DATA:

Place: Florida 
Date of Observation: 13 November 1953
Time: About 06:15 or 19 November 1953
EVALUATION: The Assistant Fire Chief of the US Naval Air Station, Panama City, Florida, who saw this UFO, stated that the object or station from directly in front of the station stopped over the station then flew around the station and headed NORTHWEST and when it was first observed it was stationary but then suddenly took off and flew away at a very high rate of speed. This individual had always laughed at flying saucer stories, but that now he was convinced, after what he saw, that there is such a thing.

(a) civilian station, Panama City, Florida. Age 28, mailing address - Assistant Fire Chief,
Panama City Fire Department.

(7) Weather and wind aloft conditions at time and place of sighting:
(a) Ground wind light, variable, east, clear with scattered white clouds and clear sky to
the north.
(b) No wind at ground level.
(c) Ceiling: scattered layer at 12,000 feet.
(d) Visibility: 10 miles.
(e) Amount of cloud cover: 0.2
(f) No unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise.
(9) No physical evidence of sighting available.
(10) No interception or identification action was taken.
(11) There was apparently (272) initial sighting, no local radar reports to local military
sighting. Local radar reports no unidentified sighting at 1232 19 Nov 53.
(12) Report prepared by 1/Lt. Oscar R.J. Moore, USAF, Intelligence Officer, Tyndall AFB, Florida. It is the opinion of the preparing 800 that since there was apparently no interception, the sighting was probably a local phenomena as it occurred at a very poor judge of altitude distance, that the sighting was probably a local phenomena.
