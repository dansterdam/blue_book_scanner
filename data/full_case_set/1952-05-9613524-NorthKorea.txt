First sighted object at about one o'clock position from our flight. By the time I called the object in on a begin, it had moved to the three o'clock position and started a steep climb, which I assumed was the beginning of a loop, but at the vertical position in the loop, the object moved forward in its original course of travel (3600) and wavered momentarily and disappeared into the haze which reached an altitude of approximately 7000-8000 feet.

"At about 1025K on 29 May 1952, a small white glowing sphere-like object was observed at 33,000 feet by the pilot and crew of a F-80 type aircraft, while on a routine training flight in the Suwon area of Korea. The object appeared to be suspended motionless for about 3 to 4 minutes. It then accelerated at high speed, and was lost to sight in about 10 seconds. Its size was estimated at 2 feet in diameter. The balloon was shot down over Chikson and the remains were retrieved for examination on the ground. The balloon was described as a small spherical type of white balloon, about 6 feet in diameter, with a small instrument package suspended beneath it by four nylon suspension lines. The instrument package was recovered and found to contain a short-wave radio transmitter and other electronic components."

"At 1840-45Z, 27 May 1952, visual observation of a radar-controlled aircraft was made by pilots of a flight of F-86 jet Sabre aircraft. Contact was made at 7,000 yards, on a tail chase heading 270Â° at an altitude of 25,000 feet. The aircraft maneuvered erratically, appeared to be jet-propelled, and was accelerating from 550 knots. D/I 5th AF Command. The 606th ADC is investigating the incident and will be the source of further information."

Comment - If true as reported, the final velocity of the object would be approximately 1,000 mph, which must be interpreted as an erratic target, rather than a normal aircraft. The results are to be forwarded via a Form 112.

An unidentified object observed a bright object traveling at 30 degrees bearing at 10,000 feet at 2352L. Length of observation was 2 minutes. The object exhibited a brightness greater than that of a standard airborne interceptor and appeared very similar to a conventional jet aircraft in size and speed, yet lacked the typical vapor trail and engine noise. Intercept by Group considered, credibility of witnesses to be excellent. D/I Comment: The incident is of interest but at this time there is no additional information available to evaluate the nature of the subject.

The estimate of the witnesses was that the flashes of light with no definite reference points makes the have considered the body discernible, but they could not make an accurate determine as to what might the speed, size, and alittude of the subject. It is believed that there have been a number of sightings similar to this one, with no definite indications of distance, speed and alittude.

Weather and Wind Conditions at time of sighting: The weather was very good and visibility was unlimited. Air to air visibility was excellent.
B. The following information concerns the second unidentified flying object encountered:
1. Date of sighting: 26 May 1952
Length of sighting: About 14 seconds
Altitude: Estimated 7,000 feet
Weather: Very clear
2. After the seven passes on the unidentified light the i/o (Bromide) called and told the crew there was an unknown on their tail. They were given instructions to break and climb. They broke and climbed, and looked back to see the unidentified light had disappeared. The aircraft started to cruise at 7,000 yards and approximately 7,000 feet altitude. The aircraft was under complete manual control by the pilot. The time lapse from 7,000 yards to approximately 30,000 yards away and the lock-on was broken. The time taken was about 25 to 30 seconds. The unidentified light was observed to turn in behind the aircraft, climb rapidly and disappear from view behind the aircraft. No actual ascertainable visual observation was made. No exhaust or prop wash was visible from the unidentified light.
3. The Director of Intelligence, Far East Air Forces forwarded a list of specific questions to be answered on the sightings of the unidentified flying objects.
It is indicated this radar set was malfunctioning. The set was working very poorly.
Experience of crew: 1st Lt (pilot) has 25 missions and 280 hours. Previous experience in this theater: He has been on one other unidentified sighting approximately one year ago. The crew normally work as a team and if possible, do not get out of each other's sight.
tor did the operator take his eyes off the scope at any time to co-The opera-2,00o yards increase in range took about 14 seconds. The time was measured by counting radar scopes. The contact was lost and was regained. The unidentified light was in the same approximate position as first observed.
3. Was the pip centered or was it at the edge of scope? The pip was centered and about 10 degrees high at all times until lock-on was broken.
4. Did acceleration appear to be constant or did it vary? The acceleration was constant and did not vary. The unidentified went into a steep climb.

Det 2, 6004th AISS, APO 970 22-85 PAGE 4 of 4

With the F-94 following up to and passing 10,000 foot altitude until look-on was broken, a description of object: The radar set was on long range and therefore it was not possible to get any closer estimates of the size of the object. The object was like a point of light and therefore it was not possible to make any measurements of it. The object was never closer than 5000 yards and at long range the pip usually merging into the screen in a night target making the object difficult to lock on. 

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER: 
From the information obtained it would appear that the two objects might have a relationship to each other, although no pips or echoes of either could be obtained. The point of disappearance at the same time for both seems to indicate some sort of common movement. This sighting appears to substantiate earlier intelligence information concerning the radar tracking of unidentified flying objects in our general sector of operations.

STATEMENT

On the morning of the 26th May, 1952, I certify as to the following:

While on base west of Promide, informed as of an unknown object located at 1:00 A.M. 26 May 1952 bearing approximately 2,500 feet altitude but unable to descern further due to terrain to determine exact location and altitude. Promide was called and stated he could investigate with his permission, as in an earlier incident we had investigated which turned out to be a jet aircraft. Promide called and said he pointed an object on my tail, as I requested, and stated as the object appeared to pull away, and i observed it through my rearview mirror, the object appeared to be of a brilliant white light. As we could discern no outline on the object due to the brilliancy of the light, we could discover no details as to its shape or size. The object appeared to slowly recede in the distance and was out of sight in approximately 10-15 seconds. At that time, the aircraft involved was approximately 6,000 yards to approximately 12,000 yards in 12-15 seconds. At that range, the object appeared as a brilliant white light for the duration as observed.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

STATEMENT

We had dropped down to about 3,000 feet to investigate, and after making a few circles over this unknown, which GCI was painting, and asking a few questions, we came to the conclusion that it was some kind of weather balloon, and it just slowly drifted off after a few minutes. But I could not, GCI said they were then painting the light, we made some passes but could not pick it up visually, and we could not tell on the radarscope just what this large object was, and it could not be seen by the naked eye except as a rather small light. Then they said they were no longer painting it on the scope, so we didn't think too much about it, except that here was another UFO report that could not be explained satisfactorily, and we did not understand how GCI was painting this large object, and it could not be acquired visually. So that was the extent of the incident.

6. Extracted from Fifth Air Force "Perintrop", 19 May 1952:

A balloon sighting: At 0900D-1, vicinity of CT 0035, an F-80 crew observed a balloon approximately 30 inches in diameter. Counter-measures were observed by beacon and radar and the F-80 was directed to close on the balloon to 20,000 feet. Estimated rate of climb of balloon was 2000 FT/MIN. At 20,000 feet the balloon was shot down over target area. The balloon was shot down over target area. The balloon was shot down at 12000 feet. Again by means of a steady burning light suspended from the balloon, it came down at CT 1010. The white light, described as "very powerful," was still burning at the time it hit the ground.

COMMENT: This report of lighted balloons may be a basis of explanation for many of the sightings reported over this area of Korea.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
TR-95-52
16 MAY 1952
Subject: Balloon sightings, 16 May 1952
1. Balloon sightings were reported from Fifth Air Force units in Korea on 16 May 1952. An observation was made by some F-86 pilots that a balloon approximately 15-20 feet in diameter and 30-40 feet long was seen passing through their area. The balloon appeared to be going at a high rate of speed as the F-86s were unable to catch up with it. The balloons were observed at altitudes varying between 15,000 and 20,000 feet.
2. Friendly pursued the balloon using jet fighters. The balloon was still ascending when lost from sight.
3. D/I Comment: (5th AF) - Further investigation is being made by the South ATSS.
Comment - This report of lighted balloons may be a basis of explanation for many of the sightings reported over this area of Korea.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM  111-23-52
APRIL OFFICE, D/F REAR
12. Extracted from USAF "Interim" #717, dtd 0520/z, 13 June 1952:
Enemy balloons: Recently several reports have been received concerning the sighting of enemy balloons at various locations, a typical observation being that a balloon was observed at an altitude estimated between 1,000 ft. and 10,000 feet. Additional observations were made on 10 May and on 1, 6, and 7 June between the hours of 2102/t and 2100/t. In each case the balloon was reported as being egg-shaped, with a basket and a flag. In one case it was reported to have moved vertically, but the operator reported that he could not traverse fast enough to keep on target. This object was observed for about 1 hours by a trained Air Technical Intelligence specialist and an ordnance technical intelligence specialist. (Command Letter 26 June) and saw a balloon being raised and lowered on a cable. This might account for some of the previous sightings but definite conclusions have not been reached. The purpose of raising and lowering the balloons could not be accounted for by a free balloon caught in a horizontal draft in the mountainous areas of that sector. The purpose of raising and lowering a balloon so near the front lines is not apparent, but could possibly be a method of communication.
