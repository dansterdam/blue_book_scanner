The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a text-based report describing a sighting of "flying discs" by a Staff Sergeant Livingston on July 6, 1947. The report provides details about the sighting, including the objects' estimated altitude, speed, and movement. There is no visual imagery included in the document.

Transcription:

At 2045 hours, 6 July 47, Staff Sergeant Livingston's attention was called by a neighbor (a Mrs. Gallagher) to witness some "flying discs" in the west of Birmingham Ala. They appeared to be 2000 above the horizon at a 15 degree angle. They were traveling southwest at an estimated 600 to 800 mph. They were approximately 10 ft in diameter, and round. They produced a dim glow or light and were traveling at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 mph. The objects appeared to be traveling level in flight. One would appear and then another would appear behind it but not always in the same path. One seemed to some slight way. The view of its source was obstructed by a nearby house but upon reaching the altitude of approximately 2000 ft it started off in the same direction as the others. Sergeant Livingston says that he did not at any time see more than one object at a time, and that it could have been one object it was his personal opinion that they were several in a group and passed one another at varying intervals.

Mr. ---- - Civilian, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio.

The following is my own personal opinions about this object:
1. I think it was a manmade object, as evidenced by the outline and functional appearance.
2. It's size was not far from 25 feet with a percentable canopy.
3. The path followed by the object appeared as though it might have been dropped from a great distance.
Seeing this was not a hallucination or other fancies of a sense.

Text extracted from the document:

Incident, MSG -- Diringham, Alabama -- 6 July 1947

This incident has no obvious astronomical explanation.

The photograph purported to be a part of the report of the incident is not documented. There is no proof in the evidence at hand that it shows the objects described. From the word description alone, which is quite limited, the objects could be explained simply as "vertical ascent", "traveled in arc." Data is too meager for a definite conclusion.

If the photograph is authentic, it would be extremely valuable to show the manner speed at which it was taken, since from this the angular velocity could be determined.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (Location): Langley, DATE: 23 JUL 1952 
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES
1. Witnesses:
Capt. H.B. Poole, 36th FIS, Turner AFB, Albany, Georgia.
Lt. R.W. Holcomb, 36th FIS, Turner AFB, Albany, Georgia.
Airman 1/c Charles H. Miller, 36th FIS, Turner AFB, Albany, Georgia.
2. The observers (Lt. Holcomb and Airman Miller) were flying a routine visual reconnaissance mission at approximately 1400 hours on 12 July 1952 when they sighted seven circular, disc-shaped objects flying at high speed on a northeasterly heading. The objects were observed for approximately one minute and during this time they accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. The objects were between 35,000 and 40,000 feet altitude and were traveling between 2,000 and 3,000 mph. The objects were observed to make abrupt 90 degree turns and displayed no trail or exhaust of any kind.
3. The following were immediately reported to Turner AFB operations:
a. The presence and description of the objects.
b. The time and location of the sighting.
c. The direction of flight.
d. The approximate altitude and speed of the objects.
4. Requests were immediately made for this sighting to be positively confirmed by other aircrews and/or ground observers. Negative results were obtained.
5. The previous sighting of the objects led to an intensive visual and radar search of the area. Although radar plots were obtained, the visual confirmation could not be made due to failure of the radar sets in the area. This failure was attributed to heavy local interference and atmospheric conditions.
6. The historical significance of this sighting lies in the fact that it represents a well-documented case of visual sighting of unidentified flying objects by competent and reliable observer under good visibility conditions. The performance of the objects observed is clearly beyond the present capabilities of any known aircraft.

Report of U.F.O. Sighting

to: Commanding Officer 
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, 46433

1. At approximately 1115 hours on 29 July 1954, a telephone call was received from Sgt. Clarence C. Chiles, 401st TACRON, WKAF [Unclear], Savannah, Georgia, who reported sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object in the area of Lake Chatuge. The object, observed and described by Sgt. Chiles and his co-pilot, Lt Colonel Gwendlyn W. Cornelius, was classified by them as an Unidentified Flying Object. The object was reported to be traveling in a westerly direction at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a northwest direction.

2. A check with the Seattle Air Defense Sector, local weather stations, and local control towers disclosed that there was no activity being observed in the area.

3. In an interview with the Clayton County Sheriff, the following information was obtained: The object was sighted by Sgt. Chiles and Lt Colonel Cornelius at approximately 0230 hours on 29 July 1954. They claimed the object was a disc-shaped glowing craft, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and traveling at a high rate of speed. It was a bright reddish-orange in color and had no visible means of propulsion. As the object passed over their aircraft, they stated they felt a blast of hot air. They reported the object to be traveling at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. He stated that this was the only report of the sighting in this area on the morning of 29 July 1954. He stated that the object was highly maneuverable and that it must be pointed out that Sgt. Chiles and Lt Colonel Cornelius are considered to be credible and reliable observers.

4. In an interview with Mr. [Redacted], one of the witnesses to the sighting, the following information was received: During the sighting, the witnesses stated they were flying at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet when the object first came into view. They stated the object was approximately a mile ahead of their aircraft and was traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 500 to 700 miles per hour. The first thing they noticed was a bright light coming toward them. As the object came closer, they could see it was disc-shaped and glowing a reddish-orange color. They stated the object appeared to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. As the object passed over their aircraft, they stated they felt a blast of hot air. The witnesses stated the object climbed rapidly and disappeared from sight within a matter of seconds. They estimated the sighting lasted approximately 10 to 15 seconds. Mr. [Redacted] stated that the attitude of the observers indicated that they were telling the truth and were not joking or making any false claims.

Text transcribed from the document:

This was reported in the same light came on from the witness obj. After the sound made by the object, it seemed to be a sign of some type. The witness object was about the size of a basketball from where the witnesses were standing. The witnesses stated that the object was headed in a westerly direction, made no sound, and was approximately five hundred feet altitude and disappeared in an easterly direction. He also stated that the sighting lasted from about twenty-five minutes. 

An official investigation of Mr. [REDACTED] was carried out by the AAPR 500-52 provided the following additional information:

a. Description of Object:
(1) Shape? Appeared to be round or elliptical.
(2) Size? Estimated to be thirty feet in diameter.
(3) Color? Light in color, such as aluminum.
(4) Number? One

M, XX is approximately twenty-five years of age; he resides on his farm and does seasonal work around the Research Exhibit, Mr. XXXXX, Walla Walla, Washington. He works for Mr. XXXXX and does farm and odd jobs around the Research Exhibit. Mr. XXXXX is considered by the people he associates with to be a reliable person.

On 21 July 1954, accompanied by Sheriff Nickell, the investigating officer investigated a reported sighting of an object from three witnesses. There was no sign of any activity in the area and no traces were found to corroborate a claim of their feet in the area. The area has a heavy tree coverage.

On 14 August 1954, an intensive ground search of the entire area was accomplished by the investigating officer for a period of three hours. The only results were a very heavy fall of various types of vegetation. Accompanying persons were several State Forest and Game people. No evidence substantiating any of the details of the sighting was found. The visibility was unlimited.

A check with the State and Forestry people disclosed that there was no other activity in the area at the time of the sightings.

A check with the Weather Bureau at Larson AFB and the assistant of the Weather Station indicated that the rain and wind conditions at the time of the sighting, with temperatures in the high eighties and the wind was perfectly calm, there was very few clouds, at approximately hourly intervals rainfall was produced. The lights observed and the visibility were a limited factor.

The results of this investigation revealed that no object of the size reported could have existed in the area in question.

The lights observed can be explained as coming from the headlights of cars and the illumination from lighted areas. This is verified by the fact that reported descriptions match the physical characteristics of automobile headlights. This fact plus the good visibility and the few trees in the area can give the illusion of signal lights when the automobile headlights are reflected from the clouds present at the time.

The sounds reported by the two witnesses can easily be explained. On the night of 29 July, the atmospheric conditions were such that even the sounds produced by normal conversation could be heard for a great distance.
