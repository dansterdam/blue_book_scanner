10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA
Appears to be a straight flight in accord with a/c observation. The streaks could be attributed to strobed lights on an unusual lighting pattern associated with the object.  The 5 minute length of observation is somewhat shorter than most UFO sightings but cannot be established to a/c.
11. CHIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Suspect that object could not be attributed to a/c.

Object described as a red center flashing blue strobe lights rapidly across the sky to the SE. Disappeared instantly. Observed for 5 minutes. Thunderstorms and occasional lightning in the area.

Stars 2, 7, 8 - Astro (Venus). Object observed for 1 hour 25 minutes on 5 Aug - Astro (Mars), Object moving A/C.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Six objects observed with characteristics of Stars/Planets rather than North or South, then one of the objects made a sharp turn in an erratic path, indicating the objects in general with Astro observations. Inversion probably added to distraction of Astro observations.
