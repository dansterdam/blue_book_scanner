The image displays a page that seems to be largely faded and difficult to fully discern due to its poor quality, but it appears to include a map or a diagram. Unfortunately, the faded nature and lack of clear detail make it impossible to accurately describe any specific features present on the map or photograph. 

Due to the low quality and faded text, performing OCR to produce readable text from this document could be very challenging, and results might not be accurate. However, given the poor legibility of the image, I am unable to provide OCR output. If you can provide a clearer and more readable image or document, I could attempt to perform OCR again.

There is no photograph present in this image.

The text in the document reads:

This Case includes
two (2) 8"x10" photos.

- page 3 -

The photograph shows a landscape with what appears to be a body of water in the foreground, with hills or low mountains in the distance. There's a noticeable dark line across the photo near the top, but it is unclear whether that is part of the scene or an artifact from the photograph itself. There's no clear image of any object that could be identified as a UFO.

As for the text, I will proceed to act as an OCR system and transcribe the visible text from the document:

The photograph shows a landscape with a stretch of water in the foreground and treelines and hills. Above the landscape, there are several dark lines or trails streaking across the sky at different angles. The photograph is an old black and white image with visible signs of age, including spots and areas where the image appears faded or damaged. There is handwriting at the bottom of the photograph.

UNCLASSIFIED

I [redacted] do hereby make the following true statement to Captain Wm. H. Smith of the United States Air Force.

At about 5 minutes to 7 on February 11th 1949 while I was waiting on the bus at Curling East, to go to work [redacted] a friend of mine called my attention to a red ball of fire in the sky. We were just looking down the river at the time and saw it, it was dull red not bright and over Frenchmans Head. I didn't notice whether it moved or not, the reddish ball was about like the morning sun in size, and then it faded out, and then flamed long with little flickers of flame on it like oil burning. It looked very long when it flamed about 10 or 50 feet as I would measure right here, I'd say it was 10 mile on the other side of Frenchmans Head.

When it flamed long it seemed wider in the middle than at thq ends. I watched it for maybe a total of two or three minutes then it seemed to just go out slowly. Mr. [redacted] said he was going to report it. The Bus Driver said he saw it too, I don't remember who he was, if I can find out I will let you know.

Witnessed.

UNCLASSIFIED

I do hereby make the follow-
ing true statement to Captain Wm. H. Smith of the United States Air
Force.

At 5 minutes to 7 on the morning of February
11 th, 1949, I was standing on the corner by Simmon and Furlong's
store in Curling East, Newfoundland, waiting for the Bus to go to
work when I saw a dull red or red orange ball over the Blow-Me-Down
Light, than it died out. and then I saw it again. She spread open in
a long flame shaped something like a blow torch flame. When I saw it
it looked about the size of the Sun when it rises only not as bright,
it was red purple or blueish when it flamed out long with little bits
of flame on it like a full Oil Light in Buss. I was about 3 miles
North West of Blow-Me-Down Light when I saw it headed towards St.
George's, then it sagged to turn and head west over lar'k [sic] Harbor and
go down and disappear. It was high over the head, it looked like it
was 6 inches above the land which means it was quite high actually.
I called that ____ attention to it and said to him what do you
think of that? I told him that I thought it was an airplane crashing
or a ship in distress and shotting off flares and that I was going to
report it to the Police when I got to work. I did report it to the
Police. When we got on the Bus the driver said he saw the ball of
fire in the sky at 25 minutes to 7. I don't know who the driver was.

Comments of interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer
(Check neighbors, police dept., FBI records, employer, etc.):

Rated as reliable and trustworthy by police and employers.  Taxi owner,
Mr. _______, knew him for three years, and says same as foregoing.
Worked for Mr. ________, foreman of Bowaters Company, for approximately
ten (10) years.  Reliable and of good character.  Investigator notes observer
is very confident of his sighting; says he could have described it better
if we had contradicted him right after he reported it.  His intelligence
quotient would be quite low.

Did observer wear glasses, especially polaroid glasses at the time of sight-
ing or was object viewed through canopy, window, or other transparent
material?

No - object was viewed from ground.

Incident
[Redacted]

Name and address of observer:
[Redacted]         Georgetown, Newfoundland

Occupation and hobbies:
Paper Finisher

Illiterate and very inarticulate considered reliable by Police.
Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

[Redacted]

do hereby make the following true statement to
Captain [Redacted] of the United States Air Force.

At 5 minutes to 7 on the morning of February 11th, 1949, I was standing
on the corner by Simmon and Furlong's store in Curling East, Newfoundland,
waiting for the Bus to go to work when I saw a dull red or red orange ball
over the Blow-Me-Down Light, than it died out and then I saw it again. She
spread open in a long flame shaped something like a blow torch flame. When
I saw it it looked about the size of the Sun when it rises only not as bright,
it was red purple or bluish when it flamed out long with little bits of
flame on it like Fuel Oil when it burns. It was about 5 miles North West of
Blow-Me-Down Light when I saw it headed towards St. George's, then it seemed
to turn and head west over Lark Harbour and go down and disappear, it was
high over the Head, it looked like it was 6 inches above the land which
means it was quite high actually. I called Jim Byrnes attention to it and
said to him "Jim what do you think of that?" I told him that I thought it
was an Airplane crashing or a ship in distress and shooting off flares and
that I was going to report it to the Police when I got to work, I did
report it to the Police. When he got on the bus the driver said he saw the
ball of fire in the sky at 25 minutes to 7. I don't know who the driver was.

SUBJECT: Report of Investigation - Unidentified Aerial Phenomena - 249

1. For details of observation of "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena -
see statements of observers and their interrogation attached hereto
as appendix Nos 3 and 4.

2. Mr. -------- -------- and Mr. -------- --------
were contacted at Bowater's Pulp and Paper Company, Corner Brook, Newfoundland, through the aid of the
local police and Bowater's Pulp and Paper Company.

3. The Investigator visited the scene of the observation twice with
the two observers and obtained signed statements from them. The state-
ments were considered to vague due to the length of time involved since
the incident, 11 February 1949, and the lack of education, and intelligence
of the observers; therefore, the investigating officer interrogated each
observer thoroughly. The results of each interrogation is covered on
the Guide to Investigation for each party.

4. All leads uncovered were traced with negative results. The bus
driver, who also observed the phenomena, could not be located. The buses
used in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, are private cars, individually owned
and do not operate on a set route or schedule.

5. Both observers were very inarticulate, and cannot read or write,
except for signing their names; however, each observer appears to be an
average Newfoundlander - a hardy, trustworthy type of individual, tending
to be more on the conservative side when stating facts; that is, it has
been this Officer's experience that a Newfoundlander of the types inter-
rogated is straight forward, truthful and does not tend to exaggerate as
much as some more literate and intelligent peoples.

6. Photographs were taken at the scene of the observation, on
25 April 1949, Curling East, Newfoundland and also at Patrise, Newfound-
land, to show the terrain and position of the phenomena. Appendix 2.

7. The terrain on which the object appeared to land is very rugged
and inaccessible and will have to be searched by air. The undersigned
will conduct a search as soon as the weather permits.

8. Each observer was interrogated regarding flares and rockets.
Neither observer has ever seen a ship's rocket, flare or toy rocket fired.
The possibility of the object being a meteorite exists. According to
both observers, it was day light when the object was sighted. The sun-
rise for the local area was 1110Z, 11 February 1949.

9. Both men seemed to be in good physical and mental health.
Mr. ------ stated that his eyes were not as good as they were when he was
younger, and that he did need glasses.

10. The following additional contacts were made concerning the in-
cident, with negative results:

a. Corner Brook Police.

b. Taxi driver, who operates in Corner Brook - Curling area.

c. Harbor Master, Captain Dykes, Chief Pilot, and Harbor Master
for the Port of Conner Brook. Captain Dykes stated that the Bay of
Islands, St. Lawrence Uhf., and Humber Arm were covered with sea ice
during early February 1949, and that he did not have knowledge of any
ships in distress or in the vicinity of the Bay of Islands at that time.
