The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image contains a photograph of what appears to be the cover page of a report. The report is titled "U.S. NAVAL AMMUNITION DEPOT, CRANE, INDIANA" and is dated 9 October 1956.

The text in the document is as follows:

1. Subject report has been compiled in accordance with reference (a).
2. On 9 October 1956, at approximately 2030 EST, two objects were sighted and reported from Crane Village, located on the western side of the Depot. The objects were described as "flying objects." The two objects were reported traveling at high speed over the Depot that same evening from a farm on the Bloomfield, Indiana, Road. 
3. A description of the objects by the Crane Village witnesses all indicate that the objects were sighted between 1910 and 1930. The objects were seen several miles to the north-east. The objects appeared to be round and bright in color than changed in color from white to red to green.
4. A member of the Depot Fire Department approached the two objects and banked toward one of them, then turned away. It is reported he maneuvered his vehicle to get a closer view of the objects. The two objects were then observed to reverse their direction and disappearance at a rapid rate of speed. The two objects were reported to have maneuvered for a while as if chasing one another.
5. Twilight had descended and some of the Crane Village witnesses could see the sharp outline of the objects. One witness states that these objects gave off a glow, which illuminated the surrounding area. The objects appeared to be from 2000 to 3000 feet in altitude and that no noises were heard nor vapor trails seen.
6. The names, addresses and occupations of the Crane Village witnesses are as follows:
1. [REDACTED] Salvage Yard

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

OC 17 September 1956 at 1900 Central Standard Time. They reported seeing two objects approximately three miles high over the northeast section of the town. They could have been objects of bright light which turned red and appeared to have changed course frequently and at times stood still, that to the witnesses appeared larger than jets at that altitude. They reported hearing no sound and concluded after viewing the objects for approximately twenty minutes that they were unidentified.

2. Enclosure (1) was prepared from a description of aircraft in the area at the time of the incident. The description was given by the witness. The description indicates that the objects were seen at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.

3. This report was prepared by the Legal Officer attached to the case, whose comments and preliminary analysis of possible causes is as follows:

The red lights reported over the target by the witness since the witnesses had no reports of any transports passing through the area, nor was there any jet activity in the vicinity of the target. If it is just as they say the transports, the contrast between the speed and turning characteristics of the objects must have been exceptional. This makes interpretation difficult.
