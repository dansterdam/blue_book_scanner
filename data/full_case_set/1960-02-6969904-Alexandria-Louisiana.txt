The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document discusses the receipt and handling of some color film that was forwarded to the center for analysis, but the analysis could not find anything on the film itself.

The text in the document is as follows:

2. The PHOTO ANALYSIS section could not find anything on the film which fit the description given by the witness.
3. It is suggested that the film be examined at the frames which received the initial indication of some unusual object for which the film was forwarded. It may be that any significant observation would have to be made on one or more of these initial frames.

14 April 1960
TO: AFCIN-4D2 (COL R.M. SHOUP)
1. It is not quite clear what the originator of the film was referring to in his description of the object. He states that the object photographed was a thin description, The portion of the film which was taken inside of what appeared to be a navigating was extremely under-exposed and the many small yellow lights were perfections from the film and these small spots of light intensants on the window and the reflected light on the lens of the camera created many circular and oval halations on the film.
2. It is suggested that the originator be asked to view the film, and indicate which frames he had reference to.
