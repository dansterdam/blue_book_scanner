UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/30/66)
SHEET 3

An interesting and perhaps significant fact uncovered by this analysis was that there was a large concentration of light sources on the northeast shoulder of the hill, leading into a sub-station in the area of the UFO sighting.

Submitted by:
Investigator: CAPT J.G. REHOBOTH MASS SUGDON

According to the document, several eyewitness accounts were gathered and analyzed regarding a UFO sighting in Rehoboth, Massachusetts on March 30, 1966. The report describes the details of the sightings and the investigator's analysis of the data submitted.

UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/20/66)

SHEET 4

Many UFO sightings being received have occurred in the vicinity of power lines and power stations.

Group # 2
Reported to be a featuring from their position and driving south along Route 18. There were 4 lights gliding along and a bright light in the rear. The lights hovered over the road for a few minutes, darting in various directions. As they moved away, the rear light was observed to make a turn and disappear. The objects were an estimated 4 to 5 hundred yards distance according to the witness.

All witnesses described the UFO as two very large brightly glowing objects. A case indicating the middle of the lane at first gave the impression that 2 cars were approaching. However, the objects were seen to split and one of the lights was observed to make a turn and disappear. Mr. Gordon stated that the two lights were about a half mile apart and were traveling about 500 yards high and maintaining the same relative position to each other. It was estimated that the total viewing time was about 2 to 3 minutes.

Group # 3
Mr. Joseph Mattosa, Postmaster of Rehoboth, was watching TV about 10:30 PM when he glanced out the window to see some strange red lights floating in the sky. He called his wife to the window and they both observed 3 red lights hovering over some trees. The lights moved slowly and silently side-to-side, up and down and appeared to be about 1,000 yards away. They continued observation for about 15 minutes when the lights started to move faster, then disappeared from view. Mr. Mattosa stated that the lights were about the size of a quarter at arm's length and would appear to be the "apparent size of a quarter at arm's length".

UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/30/66)

Full moon and he stated that it would have been much larger than the size of the moon.

He estimated that the UFO was about 3/4 mile away when he saw it as it came from behind some trees. It was oval in shape and stationary and about 40 feet in diameter. An intense light beam was coming from the bottom of the object and it illuminated the ground in a broad area into the southwest. A will-o-wisp type of flame would appear and disappear around the object. His estimated duration of the sighting was about 3 minutes. He became concerned for his safety and the safety of his dogs and he decided to leave the area. As he was leaving, the object suddenly rose up and disappeared into the western sky.

EVALUATION:
It is quite apparent that all three groups of witnesses sighted the same object. Their descriptions were substantially the same. The characteristic bright pulsating red light and the stationary nature of the object for a period of time leave little doubt that they were all reporting the same phenomenon.

The unknown object referred to, however, should be classified as unidentified. It is particularly significant that three separate groups of witnesses spread over some distance reported essentially the same object and characteristic. No other natural or manmade explanation for the sighting is apparent.

ADDENDUM I
The Providence Journal, Monday, April 4, 1966

Questioned by U.S. Officials
Rehoboth Residents See Flying Objects
"As a result of a continuing investigation of five "objects" seen in the sky above Rehoboth, Mass., on March 23, the Rehoboth Police Department has turned over its information to the U.S. Air Force Investigations Committee on Unidentified Flying Objects.
A third sighting was reported to the Rehoboth Police a little after 9 p.m. on March 23, when several teenagers, watching a movie in a private home, saw three bright objects high in the sky, much brighter than stars or planets.
Mrs. William Saunders, one of the witnesses, said that she and six other persons saw the objects for about 10 or 15 minutes.
"They were larger and brighter than ordinary stars and appeared to be moving slowly from one part of the sky to another," she said.
She said that she called the Rehoboth Police Department, and officers were sent to investigate, but the objects had disappeared by the time the police arrived.
Earlier that evening, two other sightings had been reported to the police, one by Mr. and Mrs. Norman Trembley, and the other by a group of teenagers, all of whom said they saw bright, fast-moving objects in the sky.
Lt. John Travers of the Rehoboth Police Department, said that the police had contacted the U.S. Air Force Investigations Committee on Unidentified Flying Objects, and the information gathered on the sightings had been turned over to them for investigation.

Otis Intelligence Probes
Strange Aerial Lights
An investigation of the strange aerial lights seen in the Rehoboth-Dighton area on the evening of March 23 is being conducted by the U.S. Air Force, according to Lt. Col. George W. Westbrook, public information officer at Otis Air Force Base.
Lt. Col. Westbrook said that a team of investigators is questioning witnesses who reported seeing the lights.
Dr. James E. McDonald, senior physicist with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Arizona, who was in the Rehoboth area at the time of the sightings, said that what he saw caused him to believe that it was possible the objects were a form of ball lightning.
He said that while he was driving in the area between Rehoboth and Dighton, he had observed two lights flash across the sky, one following the other. He said the lights were definitely not aircraft.
Lt. Col. Westbrook said the Air Force has been receiving reports of similar lights in the Rehoboth-Dighton area for some time, and the current investigation is aimed at determining the nature of the phenomenon.
He said that the shape and color of the lights indicate that they are not conventional aircraft. He said it is possible the lights could be the result of "ball lightning," which is formed by electrical phenomena.

UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/30/66)
SIGHTING BACKGROUND:
News of the sighting reached the Chairman via press service teletype message at DELILLAES/7:11 PM. Contact Subcommittee member Bengt G. Holmquist in this regard.
This agent arrived at the Rehoboth, Massachusetts State Police Barracks 29/30 at which time he stated stat SHAP was "occypied" to take the report. When contacted, the officer in charge stated that the report was not on duty this day.
This agent requested the original signed Sighting Report Form and was told by the desk officer that the report was still being prepared and would be forwarded. This report has not been received as of this writing.
The four young people who made report were sent to the State Police by local Rehoboth Police Headquarters and contrary to earlier press and radio service statements found that additional sightings of 1/30/66-C2 had been reported and recorded in the Rehoboth Police Blotter at 8:15 PM and the description of the UFO matches those given in this SHAP report as well.
I drove to Rehoboth Police Headquarters and contacted Lt. SHAP who was cooperative. He provided additional information as follows:
This agent visited one of the persons who reported their sighting and promised to send them to interview, but has not done so as of this time.
Tactics with some friends (referred to in SHAP report) when they say they saw the UFO.
At 6:00 PM I interviewed the four young people. (Ref: Comm #1) The appeared to be telling the truth and answered all questions candidly. ALL indicated they had no knowledge of the general UFO phenomenon and believe what they saw was an extraordinary aerial device. I made a radio check survey throughout the area where the sighting took place and found no evidence of any broken branches or grass except for a few recently broken branches. There was no evidence indicating an impact had landed in the area.
