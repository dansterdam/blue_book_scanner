[START OF TEXT]
Sir
This would refer to my letter of March 31, 1966.

In response to the information given, it is possible I have on several occasions had the experience of matching an occurrence with the information received from military or civilian intelligence.
To anyone interested, it would appear to be ridiculous. However, I cannot validate the response mentally as the signals received was about 11:30 PM Wednesday, March 30, 1966. I noticed as I was reading the article in the magazine I had difficulty seeing. I said nothing, I knew what was aboutto begin. My husband said, "That's something I've never seen." I took a look at it.

Text from the document:

"These stars, a perfect line. - I continued to watch often we had gotten into bed. Our head is pleased - That we can look out into the sky. He watched, too. But I had said nothing along the first stars were. And of grieg on a new morene behind the roof of the house across the street. My husband said "They are moving!" Then the second, then the third - it took about 10-12 minutes. All the while their lights kept very bright - then almost gone now gone to some other part of the sky I star, I say a star for want of word - it began its descent."

That took about 10 minutes. Apparently some strange lights were observed in the hoizon. The lights first appeared quite suddenly, and began moving very slowly downward to describe an arc. About 1/2 hour later, they gone, too.

A comparison with a whitish saucer-shaped object was made. There is a good amount of details provided describing the characteristics of the lights and their movement. It seems that the event lasted for 10-15 minutes, with the first 3 lights being observed for a shorter duration compared to the subsequent 2 lights.

UFO SUMMARY (Haverhill, Mass. 3/29/66)

Russell Described the object as follows: a hazy white light about the size of a grapefruit at arm's length, luminescent and moving slowly at first, then suddenly gained speed and disappeared over the horizon.

An Russell was driving about 5 miles West of Ely, Nevada on Highway 50. He observed the object in a general Easterly direction (about 35-40 degrees above the horizon) for about 15-20 minutes. The object seemed to be hovering, then it suddenly gained speed and disappeared over the horizon.

WEATHER CONDITIONS:
Clear, cool evening, stars clear and sparkling. Quarter Moon.

EVALUATION:
A. PERSONAL ATTITUDES:
1) Russell was reluctant to divulge any information until confronted directly. He had an embarrassed and uneasy manner when describing the incident.

2) Russell was very cooperative and answered all questions fully and sincerely. There was no indication of hostility or suspicion on his part.

- page 21 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a project blue book report or document.

UFO SUMMARY (Haverhil, Mass. 3/28/55)

1) Russell Conway impressed me with his clear concise manner of reporting this sighting and that he would not under any circumstances attempt to embellish or exaggerate what he saw.

2) "He was driving in his car and observed the UFO for some time and considered it was definitely not an aircraft or military device. He just passed it off as something quite unusual as he had never seen anything like it before."

3) "It was about the size of a good size house, elongated in shape and glowed with a bright light emission around the entire periphery. No sound was emitted."

4) "The object hovered about 1,000 feet in the air for several minutes and then suddenly shot off at a tremendously high rate of speed straight up into the sky. He just stood and watched it go as fast as it appeared."

SIGHTING EVALUATION -
1) Weather does not seem to be a factor in this sighting.
2) Astronomical objects can be dismissed as inapplicable.
3) The family is reasonably familiar with aircraft, both military and commercial.
4) Russell Conway's story is fairly consistent and has no obvious discrepancies.
5) It would seem that Mrs. Conway's sketch and more detailed examination is desirable to further develop the case.

a. Her observation of the object was of a greater magnitude.
b. Her son [Russell] could not substantiate her account and supporting evidence.

c. The issue of Life Magazine containing the sketch had appeared, but according to the editor, she had drawn and it was in the file cabinet. 

Taking into account all the above testimony and given the unlimited nature of the objected observed in the initial report, the case is highly significant and merits further investigation.

CHAIRMAN'S NOTE
The object described here would fall into the class "Bluebird" (Aveyron, France' 2/21/66, Washington, D.C. - 7/20/52, Lebanon, O., 9/3/65 etc.). The object was seen by others and its flight characteristic verify an unidentified aerial vehicle of unusual nature.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a newspaper or magazine article about UFO sightings in Haverhill, Massachusetts.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"UFOs Sighted In Haverhill, Mass.
Unidentified flying objects, which the police chief claims were seen by a number of townspeople, appeared over Haverhill Sunday night, according to a published report. 
Several persons, including the police chief, said they saw the objects hovering over the city for about two hours Sunday evening. The objects apparently paid a call on Bradford and other nearby areas as well. 
Later, they manifested themselves over the Haverhill police station, the chief said. 
The objects, however, had said nothing unusual from that direction. A large group of people in the vicinity stood watching the mysterious lights in the night sky, but they could not identify them, the chief reported.
One woman, Mrs. Conway, told the Gazette she and her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Russell Conway, had watched the sighting from the Conway home. 
'Mother,' Mrs. Conway told her daughter, 'come and see those lights in the sky.' 
The chief traveled in a police cruiser investigating the sighting. He said the objects were hovering about 1,000 feet in the air, and they appeared to be about 15 to 20 feet in diameter. The objects moved up, down and sideways with 'incredible speed,' the chief said. They came in four distinct colors, including red, blue, green and white, he added.
Pollard, a school teacher, said the air was 'quite clear' that night when the objects were first sighted. He had never thought seriously about flying saucers until he saw them, but we did not say he was convinced they were something out of this world.
Meanwhile, residents of neighboring communities, including Methuen and Church, said they, too, had spotted a flying light, described as 'pulsating red and white, with the colors changing around the middle.'
Several persons, in addition to the police chief, were interviewed, including Fire Chief Mathews, who had been called to the scene from the police station."

Transcribed text from the document:

Sett 2 Nov, 1960
Dear Har,
you are g glad to hear we are well. We have had a busy year as usual, and as you know. Ren has not been too well since last spring. He has had a very bad case of sinus trouble, and has taken quite a bit of treatment. He seems much better now, however, and we are hoping this will be the end of it for awhile. Ren's work at the High School has been very demanding, and on top of that he has a good many outside activities and responsibilities, so he has not had much time for relaxation and rest. However, we are planning a trip to Las Vegas over the Thanksgiving holiday, and are looking forward to that.

We were very sorry to hear about your father's illness, and hope he is improving. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. I am enclosing a little something extra in this letter for you and yours.

Best wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas.

Love,
Ren and Neta

Transcribing the text:

My single experience to account
for this event was that I was able to make
out the single outline that seemed steady
and clearly defined against the dark sky for
perhaps 10 to 15 seconds. I have no other
physical evidence to base this on. The
unusual size, speed and maneuver of the
object would suggest that it was an
advanced type of aircraft. However, I can
report no other corroborating sightings or
physical evidence to support my conclusion.
The ground search revealed no traces or
wreckage and no other reports were received
from other observers. I can only conclude that
the object I observed was some type of
advanced aircraft or vehicle of unknown origin.
While unexplained, I have no basis for
assuming it was an extraterrestrial visitation.
I simply do not have enough information to
categorize it further. Should additional data
become available, I would be interested in
learning more. To date, I can only report
my single sighting as described.

UFO 3/20/1966
Witness: Herch Grove and La Mesa, California
Witness: Dennis R. Carr

Lemon Grove, California
Independent Sighting
Background:
Neighbors Carr and Sleico had been conducting their own private investigation of UFO activities in the area. Almost every night they would observe strange objects in the sky. Occasionally their craft would hover in the same relative position for about 10 to 15 minutes, then suddenly dart away at a high rate of speed. On this date, the witnesses called to report this latest sighting.
The Object:
The witness called to report that he and the other observer named Sleico had sighted an object in the sky that evening. He described it as a bright, star-like object that hovered for a time, then suddenly darted away at a high rate of speed. The object was also reported to have been seen by other residents of the area.
On the evening of the sighting, the witnesses stated that the object first appeared to the southeast and then moved in a northeasterly direction. The object was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.
The Case:
No further information was provided on this case.

The Sighting
At about 8:45 p.m. (time checked by both observers) two pilots reported seeing a bright light viewing almost directly overhead. At first, they thought it was a satellite, but it very quickly increased in size, from a small point to a very large object. The object appeared to be stationary, although the visual impression was that it was descending. It appeared to be disc-shaped, rather than round or elongated. The size increased in a matter of seconds from what would appear to be smaller than the moon to about 40 or 50 degrees of arc. As it increased in size, it became brighter, first appearing as a golden-white color, and then taking on a blue-white color, almost as bright as the full moon. The object finally shrank back to a small point of light and disappeared at the same position. The whole sighting lasted about 30 seconds.

The text from the document is as follows:

"The sightings (cont'd)
The disappearance took place over a definite period of time. The phenomenon appeared very suddenly to the northeast, moved across to the southwest, and disappeared as suddenly, leaving in its wake the peculiar phenomenon of the outline of the ellipse and tail bending slightly as it disappeared. The apparent speed was absolutely incredible, the object appearing to be moving many times faster than any aircraft or missile known to our military forces. The entire performance was characterized by incredible acceleration and deceleration abilities. 

The observer, an experienced pilot, kept the object under continuous observation during its very brief appearance. Carr did not have his 16 x 50 binoculars with him, although the bincocular's use certainly would have been a fantastic sight, and its true characterisitics could well have been established.

The independent sighting of this "other-world" phenomenon was described as follows: The object was oval or elliptical in shape, very brilliant, and of a bluish color. It was surrounded by a nebulous field of light which seemed to be in motion, so that the surface of the object could not be clearly discerned. As the object traveled, it left behind a tail or trail, the color of which was described as being a bluish-green in color. The tail appeared to be made up of small droplets or particles. This luminous trail behind the object was observed for the full extent of its travel, disappearing suddenly as the object itself disappeared. The entire performance, from appearance to disappearance, was witnessed over a definite period of time, but its length is not specified.

An angle of 3 degrees was established between the lines of sight to the beginning and end of the object's travel. Ground distance was determined to be approximately 10 miles. Calculations indicate the object's velocity to have been in the neighborhood of 9,000 miles per hour.

The observer was a thoroughly reliable, experienced pilot, and his report was given in a manner which left no doubt in the minds of the investigators as to its truth and accuracy."

The text in the document is as follows:

The Sighting (Cont'd)
A study of scientific pictures of various rocket launchings revealed nothing to compare with the appearance of the object seen.

Ref: National Geographic Society Magazine, May, 1956

By varying the viewer's azimuth angles to the object, it was determined that the azimuth angles varied greatly. The vertical angles also varied, ranging from almost directly overhead, to near the horizon. It is felt that this degradation of definition rules out a case of observing satellite or missile test. It is felt that this was not a usual astronomical object such as a comet, meteor, or conjunction of planets, since the object did not twinkle and varied in size from moment to moment.

The object was observed long enough to obtain two triconometric solutions, and an angular value of 10-15 minutes of arc was computed for the object. At the distance of 35-50 miles, this would give a true diameter of the object between 1/4 and 1/2 mile. It is based on two strong a variation of the azimuth angles.

Mr. {Redacted} said that the azimuth angles of the object scanned were nearly 60 degrees. This, coupled with the fact that the object was visible for over 2 hours, would seem to rule out a conventional aircraft, a meteorosonde, or a distant atmospheric phenomenon. However, this continues to be the most probable explanation, notwithstanding the failure to confirm this hypothesis with that of other observers.

The object was first observed by {Redacted} in a telephone conversation with Lt. Secretary, who stated that the individual had seen an unidentified flying object. The individual said that he had seen an extremely brilliant light which did not twinkle and appeared to be elongated or elliptical in shape. He said that it hovered and maneuvered in a manner unlike any conventional aircraft or known aerial phenomena.

Actual distance of object: 116.5 miles
Actual size = 615.5331 feet = 116.5 miles
2.0 feet = arm's length
By proportions:
.0056 : 2 = x : 615.5331
2x = 3.4575
x = 1.7287 feet diameter
By varying observers' angles:
Actual distance = 20.5 miles = 108451 feet
All other factors remain constant
By proportion:
.0056 : 2 = x : 108451
2x = 1.2552

REPORT ON INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

Ely, Nevada
March 7, 1966

On March 7, 1966, at approximately 7:30 PM, Mr. John Doe, a resident of Ely, Nevada, reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Ely. 

Mr. Doe stated that he was driving home from work when he observed a large, brightly lit object maneuvering in the sky. He described the object as being circular in shape, with multi-colored lights flashing around the perimeter. Mr. Doe indicated that the object appeared to be hovering for several minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view.

This incident was investigated by the Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official government program tasked with investigating reports of unidentified flying objects. The investigation included interviews with Mr. Doe and other potential witnesses, as well as an analysis of the local airspace and weather conditions at the time of the sighting.

Unfortunately, the investigation was unable to definitively identify the object observed by Mr. Doe. The case was therefore categorized as "unresolved" in the Project Blue Book files.

The document text:

The object I seen was clearly visible in the evening hazy. The fact that close attention was apparently paid to observing this object would seem to indicate that whatever it was has received close scrutiny and careful observation, and any wrong impressions would be pretty well eliminated. This first of all appears as I remember very clearly and vividly as a point of light, as I recall, moving at a moderate rate of speed, and as it approached and came closer it became a luminous oval or disc shaped object. At its closest approach, which was probably several miles away, it seemed to me to be about the same size or a little smaller than the full moon. Of the actual shape of the object I am not certain, as it appeared to me to be somewhat elongated or oval like, but I am quite certain that it was definitely not spherical. As it approached and receded it appeared to me to maintain a relatively constant brightness, except perhaps when it momentarily disappeared behind the distant mountains. In any event, it is my firm impression that this was not any usual aerial phenomena that I have ever observed before, as its appearance, brightness, and the apparent way in which it moved set it apart from anything I have previously seen.

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old document containing text, but no visual image or photograph.

The description of the object contained herein, the measurements of its elevation and azimuth angles, and truthfulness and quantitative measurements of the observers, are in the opinion of the reporting officials of the Photographic Interpretation Section conclusive evidence that a very large object of extremely unusual appearance was seen by the three observers.

Dear sir: I am writing to inform you about a strange object which I saw yesterday evening at about 9:30 p.m. at Ely, Nevada. The object was very bright and seemed to be moving very rapidly across the sky. It appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in size, and was elliptical in shape. The object was moving much faster than any conventional aircraft, and seemed to make no sound. It was visible for only about 10 minutes, then suddenly disappeared completely. I have never seen anything like this before, and am very puzzled by what I witnessed. I would be grateful if you could provide me with any information or explanation for this sighting. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
