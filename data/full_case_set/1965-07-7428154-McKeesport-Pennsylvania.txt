UFO Case: Mr. — cont.

or that sparkled white, like something that was turning around. She was inconsistent in that she said at first they thought it might be something very high catching the sunlight or the sun one hour before dark, and on the other hand she said there was an overcast. Mr. — also watched the north-going light with an opera glass but could see no more than he saw at first.

Both she and her husband like to fish at night and are familiar with the way stars look to them in which planes go across the sky. They stated the usual thing we get in these reports "They never saw anything like it" but they would like the Air Force to tell them what it was they saw.

When she awakened her husband she said, "Get up and watch these lights." Never saw any shape, only a light, no sound, and I questioned her closely on solids in this neighborhood. At this home she says there were no soldiers nor lights seen, no visible object except this light. Both objects never paused in the same space, only the lights were seen at the same speed.

This remains an unknown unless we can show that at that precise time one of the satellites was going on a north-south passage, which is a usual rendezvous purely an illusion. We need further information on the actual object cover and on the satellite schedule. Balloons are ruled out, and I rather think helicopters are, but not necessarily. If helicopters, then their action would have to be such as to make the object lights seem to disappear and reappear in a trajectory was always a straight line, there being no sway or intermittent motion except the time when they apparently stopped. I think sending a 1(i) would now do very little good since I think I have squeezed out all the information I'm at least, now got. Now that I think of it, I guess the original report said that some stars were visible. The moon was at first quarter and so had set long before. Suggest we get the weather records, and I can further drop her a note and ask her specifically if she saw stars.

Enclosure

The following is a summary of the events observed 0400 to 0410, 5 July 1965:
Upon being awakened by my wife and asked to observe something in the sky, I saw a pair of what appeared to be stars or approximately the size of stars. Their distance apart appeared to be about one-half that of the diameter of Orion. Their distance apart appeared to be about one-half that of the diameter of Orion. This distance seemed to gradually decrease and then increase the brightness of the two star-like objects. No sound was observable, the objects were noiseless, motionless, and then no longer observable from the southern window of our bedroom. We both watched the moving light. The observation of the moving light with a pair of objects appeared to stop at about the same time as it began, and from the time it was first noticed to the time it was no longer a steady northern course, approximately 1 minute or more.

The only apparent change seemed to occur when the Cessna Convair 620 National Works, USS Poques, began to glow in the north above the mill. The light appeared to stop at this point. The glow is about a mile north of our home and in the valley we live on a hill. Very shortly the light was lost from sight.

The following observations were also noted:
The night was very calm, while standing under a tree to block interference from a brilliant light on our corner. It was noticed that the branches were very still and without movement, securely. There was no more visual. It was quiet. No sound of either piston type or jet type engines were heard. The impression was made that the object or objects viewed, extremely bright and moving at a rather raped space. My attention was caught by a northerly light, that seemed to observe the other one to move toward the south.

The position of the two lights at the beginning of the observation was to the east by approximately 20 degrees and continued to the southern light. The northern light began and followed a course of about 150 degrees and was under observation of about 10 degrees before it became almost impossible to have viewed it to or from the northern horizon. The entire episode took place under 10 minutes and was at Eastern daylight time as I had returned to bed when the last observation of the time was made. The corrections of the clock would be plus or minus 10 minutes and was in Eastern Daylight time.

October 26, 1953

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Unfortunately, I forget to ask you one very important question the other evening when I visited. When you first saw the objects coming up from the south, did you see it blinking its way, so to speak, among the stars? Were you conscious of them being there for some time out? And, later on the porch facing north as you watched one of the objects go north, was it a steady flight? Was the moon visible? Would you kindly write and give me this information, as being out and roughly how many?

Thank you for your trouble. 

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen [redacted]
Director

Dear Dr. Hynek:

I am sorry I could not answer your letter sooner, but have been hospitalized and am just now getting after correspondence. 

In answer to your query, I remember remarking that there were only three noticeable stars in the sky, and they were directly above us. The moon was not visible at any time during the interval.

To correct an answer I gave you on the phone, I believe I told you I thought it was a "blinking" light rather than a "twinkling" one. After consulting my husband we decided it was more like a "twinkling star".

I am enclosing a summary written by my husband which may clear up any information left hazy by my original explanation.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]
