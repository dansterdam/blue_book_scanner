The image provided appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a Project 10079 Record form with various fields filled out.

Regarding the photograph, the form indicates that "Photo shows 2 images (These images appear very similar to fridens.)", suggesting that the document contains two images that appear similar to the "fridens" object.

Now, as an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

THIS PASSAGE WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. ENCLUDE AND LABEL THE IMPORTANT DETAILS THAT WILL INDICATE WHETHER THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.
WHAT WAS THE ATTITUDE OR SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE OBJECT, SUCH AS ROUND DISC, ETC. INDICATE BY AN ARROW ON THE SKETCH, IF INCLUDED
THE SKETCH INDICATES THAT THE PHENOMENON WAS STATIONARY

WHAT WAS THE APPARENT OR ESTIMATED ANGULAR SIZE OR LENGTH IN FEET OR YARDS OF THE OBJECT. STATE THE LIMIT OF THE OBJECT'S COVERAGE OF A KNOWN DISTANT OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR TREE, WHICH WOULD GIVE THE APPARENT SIZE.
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE OBJECT'S COVERAGE AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT, WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 3 INCHES IN DIAMETER. BASED ON THIS, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
