UFO SIGHTING, 29 JAN 65, LONG BEACH, MISSISSIPPI
28 MAY 1965

Operations Officer
Cannon AFB, Mississippi

1. Reference the attached letter from Mr. [redacted] concerning an observation of an unidentified object on 29 Jan 65. Pertinent data indicates an observation of a helicopter or some sort. While this has required an answer several times, the information is being passed to you for any further consideration or action.

2. The information in 3a. above does not indicate an observation of a "Flying Saucer" or other type of Unidentified Flying Object. There is no information presented that would substantiate classifying this as a UFO incident.

3. It is not necessary to contact the person since 3a. previously indicated this was not a case of public interest and does not appear to contain any unusual information that would require further investigation.
