I watched them travel for fully five minuts from the time they assumed intensity until they had narrowed to the northwest except for one instance when they rotated around each other, so it was that one circled past one then the other mete loped at the line midway both were side by side again finally I saw them lift up as I had remarcably a sudden uplift --- the motion was unnatural as they met and made the circle around each other and on the fallen side of the two staying very close to the line rotating seemed to be caused by one of the tails of the saucer as they vanished in the [sun?]
