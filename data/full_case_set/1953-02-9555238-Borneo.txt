ATIC Document 108385, 25 Feb 53, Flying Saucer

Hundreds of curious Borneans today craned their necks to watch a bright star-like object which appeared to be rotating in the sky over the oil town of Seria, emitting twin jets of vapor. "Flying Saucer", said the spectators for want of a better explanation. They estimated its height at 30,000' and said it was visible for 40 minutes. Similar phenomena have been reported over Borneo several times recently.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
