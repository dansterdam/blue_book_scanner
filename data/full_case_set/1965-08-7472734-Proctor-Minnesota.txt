This is in reply to your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

A search of our case files indicates that the Air Force received only one UFO report from Minnesota for the period 2-10 August 1962. This report came from Proctor, Minnesota, and was evaluated as unidentified.

I am enclosing a copy of the Air Force evaluation of the aerial case which you requested.

11. POSITION TITLE AND COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: THE SENIOR 
DIRECTOR OF THE SAGE DIRECTION CENTER SENT TWO OFFICER UP ON THE
ROOF OF THE SAGE BUILDING TO SEE IF THEY COULD OBSERVE THE OBJECT. 
ONE OF THE OFFICERS WAS AN EXPERIENCED ROYAL CANADIAN PILOT. THEY
BOTH OBSERVED A BRIGHT STAR IN THE AREA REPORTED BY THE CIVILIAN
OBSERVER, WHICH APPEARED TO CHANGE COLOR AS THEY WATCHED IT. THE 
OBJECT REPORTED BY THE CIVILIAN WOULD SEEM TO BE EITHER A STAR
OR A PLANET, AS THE B-52 WITH IT'S FLASHING RED LIGHT WOULD HAVE
BEEN EASILY IDENTIFIED.
