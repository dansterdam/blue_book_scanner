UNCLASSIFIED
33009 Flying Type Time
Luke A.F.B. Arizona

Captain Frederick J. Thompson, Intelligence Officer, was leading a 4-aircraft flight squadron in a training session. Captain Thompson described the sighting of an unidentified aerial object which he and his wingmen observed while on the training mission.

The observation by Captain Thompson and other pilots in the flight squadron provided the following information:

- An object was never actually observed. This was a high altitude condensation trail that was observed. The first sighting, controlled visually and on the radar, was at approximately 15,000 - 20,000 feet.
- The object appeared to be about 8-10 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and had an irregular flight pattern. The object exhibited a high rate of climb and speed, approximately 1000 feet per second, ending abruptly.
- The object was observed for approximately 1000 feet, ending abruptly. This was the size of the object observed, and it did not extend across the entire sky. The object moved in level flight at the altitude of the contrail, and did not extend across the entire sky.
- Time of sighting was 1325M hours on 3 March 1955, for a period of 7-10 seconds.

Manner of Observation: Aerial observation at 25,000 - 30,000 feet from the 4-ship type aircraft. Pilot was trailing at 25,000 feet elevation. Sighting was from Capt. Thompson, pilot, as leading officer. Airspeed of aircraft was 500 MPH. Additional pilots of flight observed and passed object for an estimated 4 - 5 seconds.

Observers' position at time of sighting was approximately 8j02 N525 at 25,000 feet, with contrail at 18-20 o'clock high, approximately over Luke A.F.B. 

Sighting was made by Captain Frederick J. Thompson, 4600 Fighter Type pilot. He was leading a flight of three 4-ship type aircraft on a simulated combat mission in the Luke A.F.B. area. The object was leading the flight, and Captain Thompson obtained confirmation from the other pilots. The object was never actually observed; only the condensation trail.

The weather was 3/8 miles, visibility 45 miles. Temperature was -50 degrees centigrade.

UNCLASSIFIED
5 March 1953

On 5 March 1953 while leading a flight of three T-33 jet aircraft on a simulated intercept mission, the pilots observed what appeared to be an unidentified flying object or objects of peculiar and unfamiliar shape and size.

At the time of observation the weather was clear and visibility was approximately 35,000 feet. The altitude of the flight was 30,000 feet. The pilots were engaged in a normal training mission and the weather and visibility conditions were such that objects or aircraft in the area could normally be readily observed and identified.

The first pilot to note the object or objects reported them to the second pilot and I immediately recognized 12 to 15 objects or units approaching our position at what appeared to be a very high rate of speed. They were moving in a somewhat erratic pattern, at times appearing singly, in small groups, and at other times in a tight formation. They seemed to be maneuvering or darting in various directions. Their motion was not like that of conventional aircraft and they left no visible contrails.

They were observed for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The pilots strained to identify or classify the objects but were unable to do so. Toward the end of the period of observation, the objects seemed to move off rapidly toward the northeast and were lost to sight.

The pilots were unable to determine the size, shape or exact distance of the objects. However, they indicated that the objects appeared to be several times larger than conventional jet aircraft and were traveling at a very high rate of speed, far in excess of the capabilities of our most advanced jet fighters.

The weather conditions at the time precluded the possibility of any known aircraft or objects being confused with the phenomena observed. The pilots were experienced and well qualified to identify various types of aircraft. They were unable, however, to classify or identify the objects in any recognizable category.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
LUKE AFB, ARIZONA
30 MARCH 1953
PREPARED BY: CAPTAIN RODERICK D. THOMPSON
1. Pilot stated in original statement that it was a vapor trail. It is considered significant that he was informed by higher headquarters that it was a positive sighting (supplemented by Project Blue Book, the official identification of March 1953 sighting).
2. Film is negative. If film were returned to positive print, it would show as it actually was.
3. Altitude of object estimated to be extremely difficult to estimate. A rough estimate would be five to ten miles.
4. Local flying training was being conducted during time of sighting. Observers have confirmed that no flights in the area around Luke AFB were noticed and of jet models to have been in operation, none were being flown at the time.
5. Sky was absolutely clear at time of sighting at all altitudes in the visible area. Object was approximately 1/6 the size of the full moon and was broken for dark and light parts. Its color was greenish-blue to slightly bluish-white. It showed no trail or observation. It had direction and motion at the rate of approximately 5000 MPH air speed.

DUD DIR 5200.10

The 3 witnesses as a group sighting about 11:35 a.m. on 14 December 1953 a metallic sphere in the sky near Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. The object was seen from a point approximately 5 miles northeast of the base, moving in a southerly direction and estimated to be about 2,000 feet in altitude. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes, during which time it appeared to change directions several times. The object was described as being approximately 40-50 feet in diameter and the witnesses reported that it appeared to have a metallic finish and was rotating in a counterclockwise motion.

Near the end of the sighting, both the length and thickness of the broad trail or tail decreased, suggesting that the photo may be a plane or some other object. However, the object appeared to have come from behind a mountain and is not connected with any known aircraft in the area. The pilot's report indicates some acceleration.

UNCLASSIFIED

Variations that appeared in the object gave an impression of wings or fins, but could be distortion caused by the optical effects of the material. It was not possible to determine the exact configuration or size of the object from the data available, and only a general description can be given. Witnesses estimated the size of the object as about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object was seen on several occasions, and each witness independently reported about the same description.

Identification of nature:
The white streak photographed is probably a vapor trail from a rapidly moving subject of unknown velocity. The object itself is invisible in the photographs. Pronounced at the end of the film strip are the usual scratches in response to the material. The scratches in response to the material. The photographs bear testimony to the rapid transit of the object.

CONCLUSIONS:
1. The white streak photographed is probably a vapor trail from a rapidly moving subject of unknown velocity. The object itself is invisible in the photographs.
2. Additional visual evidence, but is designated "rapid?". This additional visual detail is on the photograph and additional visual observation indicated about the same.

The text in the document states:

M3240 FCR LUKE AFB SIGHTING

Project Blue Book personnel discussed the possibility of the vapor trail observed at Luke AFB being formed by a guided missile with the Missiles Section of ATIC on 21 June 1953. The topics of discussion centered around the following questions:

1) Is there a possibility of a missile being in the vicinity of Luke AFB? 2) Will a missile make this type of contrail at an altitude of 35,000?

The analysis of the Missiles Section stated that the charges are too small for a missile being in the vicinity of Luke AFB. Furthermore, a missile leaving its launching site would not leave a trail and it is shot down by planes to prevent its getting outside the testing grounds.

It was agreed that a missile does not make this type of trail at the above mentioned altitude. The analysts expressed their belief of the contrail being caused by two aircraft at a high altitude.

CONCLUSION: Object making the contrail was not a guided missile.

AIR FORCE RELEASES NEW INFORMATION SHEET: In their latest "fact sheet", the Air Force states that 863 out of 4,997 U.F.O. cases investigated by the Air Force since 1947 remain unidentified. In connection with these approximately 863 unknown cases, there is no proof of inter-and furthermore, the U.F.O.'s whatever they are, do not represent a threat to national security. It is indicated that the Air Force as no films, photographs, maps, charts, or records of unidentified airborne objects that have been submitted for evaluation in conjunction with reports. All such reports have been determined to be misidentifications of natural phenomena or conventional aircraft. These unidentified cases have been referred by the Air Force's own pilots to as "unknowns." A case in point is the film taken on March 1, 1953, near Luke AFB, Arizona, an described in detail in Project Blue Book case no. 333, which has been judged to be the sighting of a conventional jet aircraft. Several other similar films or movies of so-called "unknowns" have also been judged to be identifiable. Two of these film strips were included a few years ago in the documentary motion picture called "UFO." See James P. Liddell's letter in the middle of Page 8 for more information on this subject.

PART I - STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. The factual information contained in this report was obtained through investigation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting in the Luke Air Force Base area, Arizona, during the period of 9 March 1953.

2. On 9 March 1953, at approximately 1015 hours, officers and airmen at the Luke Air Force Base Control Tower observed a bright light object maneuvering in the sky approximately 10 to 15 miles southeast of the base. The object was first seen moving slowly in a northwesterly direction and then assumed a horizontal position. The object then made a rapid climb into the sky, coming to a complete stop, hovering momentarily, and then descending at a rapid rate.

3. Several other witnesses on the base also observed the object. Although it was not possible to determine the altitude, size or exact location of the object, it was clearly visible to all observers. Furthermore, the erratic and extremely rapid movements of the object were confirmed by the witnesses. All agreed that the object did not resemble any known type of aircraft.

LUKE AFB, ARIZONA 
3 MARCH 1953 

I. DESCRIPTION
In this instance, the object was never observed, but a high altitude condensation pattern was observed. When first sighted, the contrail was approximately 3000-4000 feet long, extending above the aircraft, very thin in depth and with an irregular trailing edge. As the object flew away, the contrail made a u-shaped turn at 20 degrees. During this maneuver, source and object were at right angles, moving above 500-900 feet long with an irregular, wispy trailing edge. Immediately, a condensation trail began to form and extended for several miles, diminishing in intensity. After this, the object reappeared, reversing its maneuver, and passed through the contrail again via approximately 1800 ft. long, ending abruptly. At this time, the object was traveling at an estimated 800-900 mph. The most unusual feature was that the contrail stayed with the un-lighted object, and did not extend across the sky as the contrail of normal aircraft contrails.

II. DISCUSSION
The contrail was observed by the pilots of three P-51 type aircraft with only one pilot obtaining a visual of the object itself. The pilots described the overall size as being somewhere between 50-60 miles before breaking off. The object, however, source states the observed the close-in detail of the object, which was described as being in very good condition, and has been analyzed by the photographic laboratory at WADC. 

a. The white vapor trail photographed is probably a vapor trail from a rapidly moving object. The subject itself is invisible in the photographs.

b. The exhaust vapor trail, apparently from a twin propulsion unit, is more pronounced than the end of the film itself, as though the object were accelerating in response to pursuit. The configurations in the trail object.

c. An additional vapor trail, thought to be due to distorting surfaces, is also in evidence; but it disappears rapidly. This additional vapor trail appears to be centered about the exhaust trail.

Within the content of the film, the photographic evidence have reduced the distance between the object and film as though the object were not parallel, but closing, and therefore the distance and velocity with respect to the plane cannot be determined with a full resolution.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, with the text "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom of the page. The text in the document is as follows:

Since there was no rating derived by photo-analysis that would actually aid in identifying the object involved, this report is being sent to the Information Laboratory of WADS for further analysis. Until the report is returned from WADS, this incident will be carried by Project Blue Book as unknown.
