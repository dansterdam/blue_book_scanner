About 0352237 the phenom^g^o^the ufo came up to the mov/\nd in a vertical line below it. It was of a very bright star, 1 ran upstairs to alert the family. My sov was already watching it.

The phenom^g^o^ in shape, about the same size as an umbrella point in the sky, sep^jgd^ato 3 or 4 parallel yellow lines. In the same area, the iptions fell off and became dimmer and smaller and disappeared completely.

There was a parallel yellow line that extended about the same length as the original one, but smaller and dimmer, and they disappeared.

There was a motion of what appeared to be a small motor or device of the object while I was watching it.

SAF-OTCC/Miss Turnure/76226/September 12, 1968

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This replies to your letter of September 3, 1968, in which you reported that you and members of your family have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you have seen. However, if each of you will complete one of the enclosed questionnaires and return them in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to evaluate the details and make an evaluation. It is very important that each member of your family who wishes to report this sighting complete a separate questionnaire. We are allowed to accept reports only from those persons who are reported personally by the viewer.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. The United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate identification.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

JAMES K. AIKMAN

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object Observation

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing the observations of my wife, two of my sons and myself, of a sighting of an unidentified object which we saw last night, September 9, 1968.

My son, on his way home from work, first saw the object and gives the most information on its actions. He was on the second floor of our house, looking out of a window facing the east.

I next saw the object, independently, through a door on the first floor, also facing east. My alert to the rest of the family and my wife and second son soon joined me to see the final minute or so.

We each wrote down our observations before any discussions, in order to obtain as unbiased data as possible, and I have included those writings on this enclosed sheet.

If we can be of any further help in describing this occurrence, we will be glad to do so.

Yours very truly,
[Signature redacted]

Observation of Object - Sept. 7, 1968
Time: 10:45 to 10:47 PM, Eastern Daylight Time 
Location: In vertical line below the moon, about 2/3 of the way up to the moon.
First, a yellow ball, stationary, like a bright star. After running upstairs, object, about the same place, was larger, rectangular. It then separated into 3 or 4 parallel yellow lines. Portions dropped off and one nearly reached the ground before disappearing. Other portions fell and extinguished. Finally the source disappeared, then reappeared as a fainter light for one or two seconds. Then it disappeared again.

The report includes a timeline of the object's movement and a series of sketches depicting the object's changing appearance over time.

Observation of object - Sept.7, 1968

I looked out the window and saw a bright orange-yellow objectificating slowly across the sky. After about a minute of its moving across, it stood still for about 15 seconds. Then it started moving slowly again. After about another 15 seconds. After that it started to fall apart, parts falling off and burning out until it was all over.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document describing an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on September 7, 1968.

I was listening to my radio when I was told there was a U. F. O. When I saw it it was an orange ball. In a couple of seconds it broke up. I thought it was a rocket but it fell apart a lot slower, like it was on fire.

The image contains two illustrations, but no photograph.

The first illustration is a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to use it to indicate the directions of a UFO sighting. The second illustration shows two sketches, one depicting a person standing in a landscape with curved horizons, and another smaller sketch of a landscape.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE. CURVES OR ZIG-ZAGS ON THIS LINE INDICATE CHANGES IN THE DIRECTION OF MOTION. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS.
