The rapid rate of ascent and disappearance suggests a meteorite. Witnesses reported seeing an explosion. Some factors called bolides enter the earth's atmosphere, burst, and descend as seen in this incident. These types of meteors and when they are seen, very often they are mistaken for man-made objects.
