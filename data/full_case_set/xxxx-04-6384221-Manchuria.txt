On 23 Apr 53 four F-86's were on a counter air mission over North Korea. The call sign of this flight was JOHN RED. At 1500't the flight sighted what appeared to be an estimated 20 to 25 triangular shaped objects traveling at an estimated speed of between 600 and 800 knots. The objects were seen approximately 3 miles from the aircraft at the time was GAVO.

The objects were described as being large lights, although no cables or lines were observed attached to them. Approximate 10 of the objects were observed and what appeared to be trailing dark colored streamers from the bottom portion and trailing dark colored streamers from the bottom portion and trailing dark colored streamers from the bottom portion and trailings dark colored steamers.

The passing of the objects, F-86's at the time were flying at a speed of 593 Mach. It has been reliably determined from aircraft flight logs that the wind was coming from that direction at the time of the sightings.

ATIC COMMENT: Flight activity of Chinese Communists have been noted before. The use of radar reflectors carried by balloons is entirely possible, but the reason for such action cannot be determined at this time. Such equipment may be sent aloft by the enemy to accurately check radar antenna lobe patterns or check winds or other meteorological conditions.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO.

DATE: 9 April 1953 
SUBJECT: Observations of Unidentified Flying Objects over North Korea
LOCATION: 40 52' North, 129 3' East, CCF-4 Sector, North Korea
TIME: 22:47 to 23:02, 29 March 1953

SUMMARY:
On 29 March 1953 an F-84 pilot observed 5-8 triangular shaped objects, approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter, over North Korea. These objects were observed at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet and were moving at a ground speed of approximately 100 knots with a climb rate of approximately 1,000 feet per minute. They flew in a tight formation and were observed for approximately five minutes. Weather at the time was CAVU (clear above visibility unlimited).

DETAILS:
These objects were described as triangular shaped, in the opinion of the pilot they appeared to be the size of a C-47 cargo plane. Their color was reported as bluish-yellow. Two objects were observed to be connected with a thin cable or streamer attached to the bottom portion and trailing behind the objects. The objects were observed for approximately 30 seconds without the aid of binoculars. Friendly aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting were flying at a speed of approximately 500 mph or .93 mach. The appearance of these objects was described as brighter than the known friendly aircraft.

It was the opinion of the pilot that these objects could have been released from the Antung airfield (37 2000N/128 E000') as the wind was coming from that direction at the time of the observation.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
J.R. This flight making this observation consisted of 2 F-84 aircraft, as identified by the pilot. The altitude of the sighting is estimated to be 10,000 feet. The size of the objects is estimated to be approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter. The ground speed of the objects is estimated to be approximately 100 knots.

On 19 April 1953 another F-86 pilot observed similar objects at 30,000 feet over the mouth of the Yalu River. His reported size of the objects to be larger than the 10 April 1953 observation. No other visual or radar contacts of the objects were made. The report indicates the objects were observed for approximately 5 minutes during both incidents.

ITEM: 1. Radar Plots were reportedly recorded for eight-plus, slow-moving targets in the area of 51 0320 E for several minutes starting at 14:55-11. Winds Aloft were reported to be between 350 and 360 degrees at 75-80 knots.
2. Without a definite reference point, the actual objects could not be identified. The description, however, does indicate the possibility of balloons as this could be the case. The general description does not in any way identity the objects as of aerial nature. No conclusive evidence is presented.
3. The use of a network of balloons by the enemy to accurately check radar installations and equipment may be a ruse to accurately check radar ranges and reactions. The reporting of low-value radar targets may be an attempt to overwork UN radar by sending up such false targets. The inherent danger of sighting up such false targets for UN radar would be marginal.

1st Lt. Robert Olason 
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olason:

Here are the comments on the recent batch of material. A few cases are certainly of considerable interest. Over-all, in this batch, Venus counts for only one case, but the Satellites for Planetary and moon counts for 14 cases; Balloons for four and Aircraft for three.

(Curiously the interesting cases: the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This comes very close to being a security intelligence matter. It's certainly like to get more information on this. 1st Lt. Robert got sending a short form A to the Koreans. Actually, this should have been investigated on the spot by intelligence officers.)

Papperelli AFB 2 May: This has some similarities to the old German cases. Can Antonio 7 May: This has many similarities to the Lubbock Lights and Form A should certainly be sent if this has not already been done.

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting would help. 

The Miami 20 May green light sighting might have been jets but with the green lights sighting, jets should have been tracking for over radar to see green navigation lights. A second time interval also seems too fast. I hope that you can eventually send me information on these: 20 April (Korea), 2 May Papperelli, 7 May San Antonio. 

I am enclosing my report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur. And keep 'em coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently than a larger batch at longer intervals. Send her regards.
