This cannot be much more than a paragraph long. The more detail you can give, the better.
The object was a bright light like a star but much larger and dazzling bright - about the size of a golf ball. It seemed to have a misty or fuzzy outline. It flashed on and off and moved zigzag. It would dart rapidly northeasterly, then stop abruptly and hover for a minute or so. It did this several times and then disappeared up in the northwest sky. Its movements were very erratic and unlike any manmade object.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
