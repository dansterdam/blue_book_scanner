Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter which was dated on 21 Jan. 66, I'm sorry to inform you that due to poor communications, I was unable to get the address of the variable star observers association on the Nurbin at 17 Jan. 66 and was unable to relay this information to your staff. I would appreciate being able to present this data as it may be of assistance, but I hope it won't cause you and your staff inconvenience.

I would appreciate being kept informed as to future occurrences. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Hector E. Quintanilla, Jr., Lt Col., USAF

The text includes details about an observation made by A3c P. C. Collier, an NCO Observer, on the morning of 17 January 1966 in Cloverdale, Oregon.

Colonel, USAF, Chief, Project Blue Book".
