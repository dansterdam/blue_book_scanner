11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Witness was flying down on the ground looking through a pair of binoculars when they saw an object that was shooting past at about 120 mph. It was a brightly colored object with colors green, yellow, and real bright orange. Five minutes later witnesses saw an object with a bright orange outline and a yellow inside. Information in letter quite sketchy, therefore, forms sent to witnesses.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and a compass-like illustration. The sketch appears to show the path of an object or objects in the sky, with instructions to draw a picture that will show the motion of the object(s) and any changes in direction during the course.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

IT WENT PAST ME WITH GREAT SPEED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE DISTANCE.

The image appears to contain a drawing or sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts several elements, including a large eye-like shape at the top, some trees or vegetation in the lower portion, and what appears to be a vehicle or object on the ground.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO reports from 1947 to 1969, so this document likely contains information related to that investigation.

Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the document:

DINSMORE ALLEN COUGHS INCIDENT DATE: 20 APRIL 1966
LOCATION: UNION, NEW JERSEY
INVESTIGATOR: ALLEN HYNEK

RECEIVED BY: BLUE BOOK
DATE: 27 APRIL 1966

- page 21 -

The image appears to contain a series of black and white photographic images or sketches, but does not depict any human faces. The central image appears to show a circular or rounded shape with some irregular markings or patterns within it.

Below is the text from the document, as transcribed by an OCR (optical character recognition) system:

Unknown aerial objects, Union, New Jersey, 7094719, 4-7-66.
On 4-7-66 at 8:00 PM, the witness observed two objects in the sky. One object appeared glowing and round, while the other was elongated and blinking. The glowing object moved rapidly from right to left, then accelerated and disappeared. The elongated object moved slowly, blinking, and then also accelerated and disappeared. The witness took several photos of the objects, but none of the photos are clear enough to show the objects in detail. The witness reported the sighting to the local police department.
