The image provided is a highly blurred and overexposed document with no discernible photographs present. The text on the document is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the image. There are some visible words such as "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top right and a list that has been mostly obscured. Due to the condition of the document in the image, I am unable to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document.

The image you've provided appears to be a scanned page from a document, but it does not contain any clear photographs. Instead, there are some markings, annotations, or sketches, along with text. The image is of low quality and features overexposure and poor contrast, which makes it difficult to discern the details.

From what is visible, I can attempt to transcribe the legible text, but please note that due to the quality of the image, some guesses have been made:

The document does not contain any photographs. It is a typewritten report with a small section that appears to be a torn-out piece from a newspaper or similar publication. Here is the text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

Extract from CURRENT NEWS Comment, prepared by the Analysis Div.,
Office of Public Relations, Eq., Army Air Forces

ROCKET EXPLOSION
REPORT 'FALSE'

EL PASO, Tex., Oct. 16 (AP). -- Ten. Enrique Diaz Gonzales, who
commands the Juarez Military garrison just across the border
from El Paso, today blamed a "False report" for the Mexican War
Department's announcement that an American rocket landed south
of here last Sunday.

His statement was made as search was resumed for a mysterious
object which blazed through the sky, crashed and apparently
exploded in the mountains near the village of Caseta, Mexico,
across the Rio Grande from Fabens, Tex.

The War Department In Mexico City asserted two days ago
that investigation indicated the object was a V-2 rocket launched
from a U. S. Army experimental station in Texas.

There is also handwritten text at the bottom right of the document. However, it is partially cut off and not entirely legible. It seems to say "4716- -" followed by a check mark or similar mark. The quality and nature of the image do not permit me to provide any more accurate or complete transcription.
