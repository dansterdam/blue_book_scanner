Lincoln, New Hampshire 
August 30, 1961
There appeared in the sky to the east-southeast, a seemingly large object resembling a luminous sphere, surrounded by a diffuse glow.

The object seemed to remain practically stationary for one to two minutes. It then appeared to move away rapidly in a northeasterly direction until it was no longer visible. The witness estimated the duration of visibility to be approximately two to three minutes.

The object appeared to have a solid, circular shape, surrounded by a diffuse glow or haze. There was no trail or exhaust visible.

The witness, a retired Air Force officer, stated that in his opinion, the object was not an aircraft, balloon, or any known celestial body. He further stated that he had observed many aircraft and celestial bodies in the course of his career, and that this object was unlike anything he had ever seen before.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: LINCOLN, N.H.
Date (Local): 22 Sep 61
Hour (Local): 20:15  
Hour (2 Time Group): 22/0015, to 0030

Satellite: _________

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): _____

Radar Analysis (TD-63): Bright white light above stars and tree tops. It hovered at times and at other times moved rapidly, then disappeared into the starry sky.

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): _________

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: __________

Other: Observed bright light for about 2 to 5 minutes over tree tops, moving rapidly at times, then hovering and finally disappearing into the starry sky.

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Reliable, good.

Analysis and Conclusions: This appears to be a legitimate sighting of an unidentified aerial light phenomenon. The observation of the rapid movement, hovering, and then disappearance into the starry sky is consistent with unexplained aerial objects reported in other sightings. The reliability of the observer is assessed as good, further adding to the credibility of this report. While the exact nature of the object remains unknown, the characteristics described indicate this was not a conventional aircraft, satellite, or other known astronomical object. The sighting warrants further investigation as a potential unidentified flying object.

ITEM REPORTED: A luminous object with brilliancy greater than surrounding stars.

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: A luminous object, considerably brighter than surrounding stars, was observed moving in the southern portion of the sky for approximately 15 minutes. The object appeared to move erratically, waver and change direction. It was observed through 7x50 binoculars.

Approximately 2 minutes after the object was first observed, another luminous object appeared in the southern portion of the sky and moved in a generally southeast direction. This object appeared to be considerably smaller and dimmer than the first object.

After the initial observation of the two objects, the larger and brighter object continued to be observed for approximately 13 minutes before disappearing from view. The smaller object was observed for less than 5 minutes before disappearing from view. Both objects were observed to be silent.

IDENTIFICATION: Insufficient information available to make a positive identification of the objects observed.

REPLY TO Hq USAF SAF-OI 3b (Mrs Geiser) 
WAFR 25 D C

1. Reference the attached letter from Sgt TDEW of Lincoln, New Hampshire, on unidentified objects. Our investigation has been completed and a report is being prepared pertaining to various sightings. He has also received the DOD Sheet; This letter is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. Specific answers pertaining to the case of Sep 19-20, 1961 are as follows:

a. The Barney Hill sighting was investigated by officials from the Blue Book AFRP. The case was found to be insufficient direction (Estimate) and was reported and there are inconsistencies in the report. The sighting could not be adequately explained and the object was maneuverable. Velocities were given. The planet Jupiter was in the South West. It is doubtful that the object in question could have been Jupiter. The planet Jupiter was in the South West. The approximate time that the object disappeared without incident conflates that the object could not have been evaluated as
Jupiter. No movement was noticed. The object was identified as the planet Jupiter in all probability.

b. The Air Force did not investigate the sightings in Hollywood, California on Feb 5, 1960.

Part Two: An "abducted" woman describes her incredible experience
BY JOHN G. FULLER

RETURNING FROM a brief vacation in Canada in September, 1961, Barney and Betty Hill had a deeply disturbing experience that they could remember only vaguely. They had sighted what may have been an Unidentified Flying Object that seemed to follow their car. Their anxiety about the incident led them to the office of Dr. Benjamin Simon, the distinguished Boston psychiatrist, on December 14, 1963. Because of the disclosure of the Hills' conscious recollection of the episode, Dr. Simon decided to question them under hypnosis in January and February 1964 in order to determine more clearly the nature of their experience. Under hypnosis, he was able to elicit from them recollections of an extremely unusual experience. It was later a study and reference.

During World War II, Dr. Simon as Chief of Neuropsychiatry and Executive Officer at Mason General Hospital, had extensive experience with hypnosis in the treatment of many psychological disorders among military personnel.

Barney Hill, who is a Negro, told of the journey from the Canadian border to their home in Portsmouth, N. H., and described a glowing orb that seemed to follow them during part of their trip. Under hypnosis, he re-created the scene in much greater detail, and added an incident he had not mentioned during the earlier interview. The low-flying UFO had descended. Hill said the objects and humanoid creatures had then blocked the road. They had "abducted" him and carried him aboard the UFO for a strange physical examination. After several sessions with Barney, Dr. Simon decided to question Betty Hill, who is white, under hypnosis as well.

Within the first minutes of her trance, Betty Hill recalled a story that was remarkably similar to the one Dr. Simon had heard from her husband. After she and Barney had a number of close encounters with these celestial creatures on the highway they came to a clearing - and there they were standing beside their car, and then came to themselves on the highway again. At that point, "a kind of daze 'overcame her," she said. "And the men took them both back into the car," she continued. "And I turn around, and I say: "Barney, Wake up!" - And he doesn't pay any attention. He keeps walking. 

One of the men walking beside Betty said: "Don't be afraid. We're not going to harm you." These men spoke good English. Betty. Only one spoke - "He had sort of a foreign accent. . . .We kept walking, and we came to a clearing. . .The object was on the ground. . .I think it was the same one I had been watching in the sky. . .and they're taking me up to the object. I didn't want to go on inside, but the man beside me says to go on. . So I go inside, and one of the others takes my arm. . . I go inside, and there's a corridor. I turn around, and I'm waiting for them to bring Barney in. But they just Barney right past the door where I'm standing, I said: "What are you doing with Barney?" The man said: "No, we only have equipment enough to examine one person at a time. And if we tried to do both in the same room, it would take too long. Another room comes in . . .I think he's a doctor. . .They put up the sleeve of my dress, and they look at my arm. . .and then they turn my arm over, and they look at the underside. . .And they rub, they have a machine. . .it's something like a microscope, only a microscope with a big lens. . .I had an idea they were taking a picture of my skin. . .And then they took something like a little paper opener - only it wasn't a - and they scraped my arm. . .And there was like little - you know - like little particles of skin? And they took a piece of cellophane or plastic or something, like little particles of skin? And they took a piece of cellophane or plastic or something.

"They" seem puzzled
by time and aging
something like that, and they scraped, and they
put the flakes on this plastic. . . And the leader
of the group puts it in the top drawer. . .And then
he says, "we've got to put somthing that holds your
head. . . And the examining opens up, and
looks into them with a light, and he opens my
mouth, and he looks in my throat and my teeth
and in my ears. . . And then he takes like--you
know--a swab--and he puts it in my left ear, and he puts
that in another piece of this material. And the
leader rolls it all up and puts it in the top drawee
too. Then they take a couple of strands of my hair,
and they pull it out, and the grows right back to the leader,
and he wraps that up and puts that in the top
drawer. . . And the leader then says, I believe my
eyes, under my eyelids, and--oh--and--oh--and the--the--oh--and then they take off my shoes and look
at my feet and at my hands. . . And he takes
something, and he goes underneath my fingernail, and cuts off a piece of my fingernail, and
he puts that in the top drawer too. And he asks me
to take off my dress. . . And I slip my dress off.
. . . He draws on the table, on my back, and he
brings this--and, how can I describe it? They're
like little dots, a whole series of needles, and each
needle leaves a little wire going from it. . . . they come
with the needles. . . . lie draws them on my back. . . .He
puts it on my arms and my legs, and then
--And then he looks at it all, and he says again, "This
would ever, ever believe me. . . .And that's the end
of the testing. And the leader helped me up.

... then they said that was the end of the testing.
And the leader helped me up. . . I put my dress
on. And he seems to go up in the air a little bit, I
would say, and then I--I stand up and put my
hair-- and I can go now? I can go back to the car? And
he said: Barney isn't really here. . . .He still thinks
they were doing a few more tests with him, but
there he was, along in a minute. . . .I started talking with the leader. And I said to him that this
had been quite an experience for me. . . .That no one
would ever, ever believe me. . . . And that what I experienced, would say some part of this had really hap-

thing about the universe. And I told him, no, I
know practically nothing. . . .And he then went on
the moon and public law and then he adds up
here--like this before-- There were things that
were all little dots and so, scattered all over some-
were little, just pimples. And others were as
big as a nickie. And there were less. . . going
from one dot to another. And there was one big
circle, and it had a lot of little dots coming out from
it. A lot of little dots going to another circle quite
close, but not as big. And others vary larger.
And I asked him what they meant. And he said
various things about the universe.

OCRED TEXT:

DOCTOR: Did they make any sexual advances to you?
BETTY: No. . . . I asked the leader, I said: Why did they put that needle into my navel? And he said it was a pregnancy test. I said I don't know what they expected, but that was no pregnancy test. And he didn't say any more.
DOCTOR: All right. We'll stop here now.

The BETTY returned to the office for further questioning on March IS, 1964.

DOCTOR: About this needle. How far in did he inject it?
BETTY: Oh, it was a long needle. I don't know, I thought it didn't go in, but I would say the needle was four inches long, six, maybe. . . . Something like that was attached to it. They didn't leave it in very long. Just for a second.
DOCTOR: What kind of pain was it?
BETTY: All I could think of was a knife. . . Then, I was grateful to the leader for stopping the pain

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
INVESTIGATOR:  
MAJOR LAWRENCE J. TACKER  
REPORT  
ON  
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING   
LINCOLN, NEW HAMPSHIRE  
8 SEPTEMBER 1961  
1. BACKGROUND  
On 8 September 1961, at approximately 2000 hours, an unidentified flying object was reportedly sighted in the sky over Lincoln, New Hampshire, by Mrs. Evelyn D. Frost, a resident of that town.  Mrs. Frost reported the sighting to the State Police and the incident was subsequently referred to the United States Air Force. An investigation of the incident was conducted by Major Lawrence J. Tacker, Headquarters USAF, on 9 September 1961.  
2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING  
Mrs. Frost stated that the object was first observed at approximately 2000 hours on 8 September 1961, as she was observing the sky from the window of her home. The object was described as appearing larger than a star, and it seemed to be very high in the sky. Mrs. Frost stated that the object emitted a bright, pulsating light which changed colors, going from red to green and then to yellow. She watched the object for approximately 20 minutes, during which time it remained stationary in the sky.  
3. CONCLUSION  
Based on the investigation conducted, it is the conclusion of the United States Air Force that the object sighted by Mrs. Frost was a star or planet, the apparent pulsation and color change being caused by atmospheric conditions. No evidence was found to indicate the presence of an unidentified flying object.
