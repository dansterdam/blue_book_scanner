REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 11 August 1967, at approximately 2215 hours, the witness, J. P. McGinnis, a 
resident of Manchester, Pennsylvania, reported observing an unidentified flying object.

2. The witness stated that while driving home from work, he observed a bright light in the 
sky which appeared to be hovering. He stopped his car to observe the object more closely.
The witness described the object as elliptical in shape, with flickering lights on its surface. 
He estimated the object to be approximately 150 to 200 feet in diameter. The object 
remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from 
view. 

3. The witness immediately called the local police to report the incident. The police in turn 
notified the nearest Air Force base, Olmsted Air Force Base. An investigator from the base 
was dispatched to interview the witness and examine the area. Two photographs were taken 
by the investigator, which are included with this report.

4. Based on the witness testimony and the physical evidence collected, this incident remains 
classified as an unidentified flying object. No explanation for the observed phenomena could 
be determined.
