10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Since the form 117 gives the date of the observation as 22 Dec 67 and states the objects sighting occurred at about 0100Z, this information does not seem to agree with the date and time group at the beginning of the report which gives the date as 01/0200Z. This information is insufficient to evaluated the sighting and provide a conclusion about the nature of the observed object.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted an object that is identified with an aircraft having bright flashing lights. This object remained stationary for about 5 minutes and still is, with various colored lights on its bottom and gives no different feelings to the observer. It is a round disc with a light of upper hand it is unclear.

The sketch depicts a series of spheres or orbs arranged in a row, with a central object that appears to be some kind of rod or projectile. The text accompanying the image describes the object's diameter, some form of "penetration" or interaction with it, and the relationship between the small center and the larger size.

Dear
This is in replies to your letter of December 20, 1967. Yes, it is possible to take a picture of a flying saucer as you suggested.
The photo which you submitted is an excellent example of a fake flying saucer. Thank you for your letter and good luck.

T would like to report on a very strange sight that was observe about the night of 12-6-67. I observe a round shape object with bright lights around the edge. This object was very high up and moving very much. 

I got at look at the object with this 7x50 binoculars. because I really seen something that would be possible to take a picture of at a U.F.O., but would not have been able to use my camera. The shape seemed to change from round to oval and the lights around the edge would dim and brighten up again at times. 

I decided it would be impossible to take a picture of this U.F.O., that looked as good as how I seen it. I rode out to where I could get a clear shot but it was gone when I got there. The object seemed to disappear very fast. I have never seen anything like this before.

TEXT:
Honaker, Virginia
December 6, 1967
REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. INTRODUCTION:
On 6 December 1967, SSgt John E. Honaker of the U.S. Air Force Security Police Squadron at Langley AFB, Virginia, contacted the Langley AFB Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and reported that he had observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky over Langley AFB on the evening of 5 December 1967.

2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING:
SSgt Honaker stated that at approximately 2030 hours on 5 December 1967, while on routine patrol, he observed a bright light in the sky to the southeast of Langley AFB. The light appeared to be moving slowly and silently in a northeasterly direction at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. SSgt Honaker watched the object for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared from view. He described the object as circular in shape, approximately the size of a basketball, and emitting a bright white light.

3. INVESTIGATION:
OSI personnel were immediately dispatched to the area of the sighting to conduct an investigation. A thorough search of the area was conducted, but no further evidence of the UFO was found. Interviews with other Langley AFB personnel on duty at the time of the sighting failed to corroborate SSgt Honaker's account.

4. CONCLUSION:
Based on the investigation, the Office of Special Investigations was unable to determine the identity or origin of the object observed by SSgt Honaker. The sighting remains classified as an Unidentified Flying Object.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph that is blurry and indistinct. It shows a rectangular shape in the center of the frame, which could potentially be some kind of unidentified object, but the details are not clear enough to make any definitive conclusions about the nature of the object. The surrounding areas of the image are also blurry and indistinct, providing little additional context.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

No text was found in the image provided. The image appears to be a blurry black and white photograph without any visible text.

The image appears to be a blurry, black-and-white photograph. It shows a vague, indistinct object or shape in the center of the frame, with a slightly darker or more defined area towards the left side. The overall appearance is hazy and lacking in fine detail.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

HONAKER, VIRGINIA
December 6, 1967

The witness observed a bright light in the sky southwest of Honaker, Virginia, at about 6:45 P.M. on December 6, 1967. The light was stationary for about five minutes, then began moving in a zigzag pattern, changing color from white to reddish-orange. It finally moved rapidly to the northwest and disappeared from sight.

The image contains a diagram that appears to be a sighting questionnaire or report form related to an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The diagram includes a diagram for the observer to indicate the elevation and azimuth of the observed object. However, the image does not contain any photographs.

REPORT

According to the description, the object sighted was "a brilliant orange color appeared above the horizon in the southwest at an estimated altitude of about 12,000 feet. It remained stationary for about 35 minutes, but an hour later it returned and was again observed for about 15 minutes. The object appeared near white, traveling at a fast speed, then it suddenly stopped, hovered for a while, and then took off at a tremendous speed and disappeared."

Mr. S. S. Tapling, the witness, stated that "when the object first appeared, he immediately began to photograph it, but when he pressed the release, it suddenly disappeared. Two minutes later (six-minute, .16-mm), as he was re-adjusting the camera, the object reappeared in the same location, and he was able to make two more exposures."

The report concludes that "the object was visible on the two exposures obtained, and that it was a real physical object, not a reflection or optical illusion."

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object (or objects) were when you first saw them. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object (or objects) were when you last saw them.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" or "C" to show any changes in direction during the course.

If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The color was gray or silver. It appeared to be hovering at one point and then made a rapid departure, disappearing from sight quickly. I am uncertain of its exact speed and distance, but it was traveling at a high rate of speed and was not far from my location.
