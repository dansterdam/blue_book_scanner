CASE HISTORY - THE VISUAL POINT, OCC, WHEELING, OHIO

On 8-6-53, the report states that at around 2:00 AM, the witness, who lived near Sharpsville, Ohio, saw an object with a tendency to wobble and while it was moving, it suddenly went into "degrees of ascending counting." The object was described as being "disc-shaped" and while it was being observed it suddenly disappeared.

Four assembled men watched the "spectacle," but they did not believe their eyes. One of the witnesses was said to be watching a low-flying plane going to the east. The object was described as being "vivid oval in shape, as big as the moon," and it was observed for about 2 minutes before it stopped abruptly "straight overhead." The report states that the object then disappeared, and the witness said it looked like a "worm squirming." The witness also mentioned that the object had a "brilliant display of light" and that it left a "short, squat trail" as it disappeared.

The report concludes by stating that the sighting was "hard to explain" and that the witness could not determine the true nature of the object.
