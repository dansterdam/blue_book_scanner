Dear Sir:

Your recent letter to the Commander at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was referred to this project because of its relation to our activities. 

The Project Office has determined that you are correct in your sighting of some unknown aerial phenomenon on September 3, 1954. The details and the descriptions are all consistent with other similar reports received from that area.

Enclosed is a summary of information on Project Blue Book and the program for dealing with aerial phenomena of this type. We think this brochure will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. JACKS
Public Information Division
Office of Information

          WASH 25 D C

1. Forwarded are the attached letters requesting information on unidentified flying objects.

2. The objects observed from Cincinnati on the evening of June 8 1964 consisted of about 25 bright lights moving in a horizontal line across the sky. These lights appeared to blink on and off and to change relative position with respect to one another. Several witnesses estimated the objects to be at an altitude of 10,000 feet and moving in an easterly direction at an estimated speed of 600-700 mph. This sighting was investigated and no explanation for this phenomena could be determined.

3. The sighting was reported to the ATIC at 0215 hours. Standard form 14 is passed herewith. This sighting, if valid, may be attributed to an illusion. This portion of the sighting was probably caused by the reflection of lights through atmospheric disturbances.

Dear Sir:

We are three boys who have seen something on early Saturday morning, June 27, that we think you might be interested in hearing about. We were sleeping in a field just adjacent to Ravenna Road in Forest Hills, Ohio, when we saw at approximately 4:55 AM a light moving very slowly at a low altitude. As the light approached, we saw that it was a large, saucer-shaped object, silent, and giving off a glow that illuminated the surrounding area. It hovered over us for a few seconds and then moved rapidly away in a northeasterly direction and disappeared from view. We have not told anyone else about this, as we were a little doubtful as to whether you would be interested. However, we felt that you should know about this incident. Please let us know if you would like any additional information.

Sincerely,

First one of our tele phone numbers and we were asked to keep it around what happened when at about 5:30 A.M. We returned to our sleeping location and told someone that had appeared when at 2:30 A.M. In the same direction, and pattern only higher in the sky again we said that was light that remained quite lit but seemed to darken it seems on its own and grew smaller as it moved away, till it cleared is scene again, giving no new appearance. We saw no evidence even the body that could have caused such a light, nor any gaseous effect. We hesitated to try to make another close approach for the glance of the object in future seeing and the dispatcher cautioned us not to do so it were more against reg, nut not to look ridiculous and discredit the possibility of a case that had not been contacted by the authority, so we still are not sure what that light represents. They moved in a strange unexplainable maneuver, that is quite difficult to put in the matter. But more will be tried out there with the assistance for this difficult tattle.
