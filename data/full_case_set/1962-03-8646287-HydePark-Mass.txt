The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an office memorandum from the United States Government, dated March 23, 1962. The text of the document is as follows:

OFFICE MEMORANDUM - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
DATE: March 23, 1962.
FROM: (Please pass to ATIC)
SUBJECT: Three UFO's observed at 10:45 A.M., EST, March 22, 1962.

The following report was received last night by telephone from Mr. [REDACTED], Washington Street, Hyde Park 36, Mass.:

"At about 10:45 A.M. EST, March 22, 1962, I was looking to the north-west out of the window of my building. I observed three objects in the sky which appeared to be circular in shape and silver in color. They were moving in an easterly direction at what appeared to be a high rate of speed. They were at approximately the same altitude, and after being in sight for about 10-15 seconds, they disappeared from view. The objects appeared to be gliding, and there was no sound associated with them. This account is based on the observation of these objects which I considered to be unusual, and their appearance and manner of flight seemed to be authentic."

This account sounds plausible and authentic.
