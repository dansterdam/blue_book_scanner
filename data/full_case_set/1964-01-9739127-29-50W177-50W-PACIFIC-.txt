The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969. The page is a Project 10073 Record Card, which contains details about a UFO sighting observation.

There is no photograph included on this page. The page is filled with text-based information about the UFO sighting, including the date, location, type of observation, number of objects, course, and a brief summary of the sighting. The summary indicates that the observers saw a bright light in the morning sky that appeared to be a flare or meteor.
