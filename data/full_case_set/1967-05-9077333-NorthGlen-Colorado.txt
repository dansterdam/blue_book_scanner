The image does not contain any photographs, but rather contains a sketch and a compass-like symbol.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR system, I will output the following text from the document:

15 May 1967
Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: A frame or flame on one being and two lights of the army stars in the sky that I have seen more as moving and flashing of the white lights west, and Bienecucve which are 7 to 50 seconds and took a good look at it. It was about 30 feet in size on mass over the ground in hourly basis. Brighter than the star and was the whole mass on the ground.
