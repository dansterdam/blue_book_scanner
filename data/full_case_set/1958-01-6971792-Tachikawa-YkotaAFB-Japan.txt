TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. GENERAL:. Reported by: [redacted] the Air Technical Intelligence Group, 5th, Air Force.

2. DESCRIPTION: Ten unidentified aerial objects were observed over Tachikawa Air Base, Tachikawa, Japan, at about 1800 hours on 19 December 1957. The objects were first detected on radar at a distance of approximately 35 miles from the base and were tracked closing in on the base at a speed of 1,500 to 2,000 mph. At a distance of about 10 miles, the objects slowed to an estimated speed of 800 to 1,000 mph and began maneuvering in the vicinity of the airfield. Visual observation was made by the air traffic control tower personnel.  

3. LOCATION: TACHIKAWA AIR BASE, TACHIKAWA, CENTRAL HONSHU, JAPAN (35-42N, 139-24E).

4. TIME: a. Initial detection on radar at a distance of 35 miles at 1800 hours, 19 December 1957.
b. Visual sighting from 1800 to 1815 hours, 19 December 1957.
c. Objects disappeared from radar at 1815 hours, 19 December 1957.

5. AIR ACTIVITY, WEATHER, ETC: a. Ceiling, 8,000 feet, 10 knots from 270 degrees (true).
b. Visibility, 6,000 yards.
c. Windspeed, 10 knots.
d. Slight high overcast, haze, clear, scattered.
e. Air activity, routine training flight 74 (1), 68, 6, visual.
f. AF 200-2, paragraph 7d (1): Negative.

6. ANALYSIS: The Air Technical Intelligence Group, 5th Air Force, considers this incident of extreme importance and urgency. The objects were reported to maneuver at extremely high speeds, exhibiting performance characteristics far in excess of any known aircraft. Flight paths and maneuvers were such as to indicate intelligent control. The objects were capable of instantaneous bursts of speed and acceleration, with no visible means of propulsion. Their appearance and disappearance from radar and visual contact was sudden and unexplained. Similar incidents have been reported by other observers in the Pacific area. Analysis of this incident is continuing in an attempt to determine the origin, nature and purpose of these objects.

7. APR 200-2, PARAGRAPH 7d (1): Negative.

8. APR 200-2, PARAGRAPH 7: Negative.

9. CONCLUSIONS: The objects were determined to be unidentified flying objects, the nature and origin of which could not be established from the information available. Further investigation is continuing.

"I saw an object that appeared to be a fairly large, round, silver colored object with red lights around its edge. This object was just above the mountains and travelling in a NW direction. It was moving rather fast and seemed to be at an altitude of about 1500 to 2000 feet. It only visible for about 60 seconds before it disappeared behind the mountains. It was a clear night and visibility was good. I was not able to take any pictures as this was a spur of the moment observation."
