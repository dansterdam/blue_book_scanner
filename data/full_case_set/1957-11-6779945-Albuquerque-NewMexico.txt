NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

FIRST-HAND REPORT OF A UFO EMITTING A RADIO SIGNAL

The following extraordinary observation came to us via Lex Mebane, through the courtesy of a mutual friend, Mrs. Anthony W. Dander, of Roslyn, Long Island, a connection of contacts who arranged for an interview with the witness. This observer presented a crop of UFO appearances on November 5th that made that day such a dies mirabilis in American annals.

The observer was Mr. Jacques N. Jacobsen, Jr. of Staten Island, a young man trained as a meteorologist, who noted a response position in New York City with a large railroad company. In the first week of November he was on vacation, visiting in the Lake Baskatong area, about 100 miles north of Ottawa. There was no electricity at the camp, but they had with them a portable short-wave radio "of the type used in World War II landing craft." (Both ground and battery are represented which names on the side.)

At about 9 p.m. Totten went out to the outhouses; he came back breathlessly exclaiming: "There's a flying saucer out there!" The others laughed, and suggested that he invite the little green men in for coffee. (Mr. Jacobsen thought they had best leave them alone — the whiskey had cut one hour before.) However, he insisted. They went out on the porch and sure enough, there was, as Totten had said, a brilliantly illuminated object hovering over the lake, about one-half mile distant, at an estimated height of two or three miles away. Might this actually have been a misinterpretation of the sky phenomena?

By no means. The sky had been completely overcast by heavy, low-hanging clouds for several hours, and the object was beneath these clouds. This round, lenticular object suddenly emerged from the heavens, coming down from the top of the clouds, the upper beam illuminating the undersurface of the low clouds. (See the accompanying sketch, by Mr. Jacobsen's own hand.)

The brightness of the object was dazzling — "like looking into a searchlight". (Other witnesses were using 25-power binoculars. Its color was yellowish-white, not the bluish-white of a summer. Because of the glare, its edges were not sharply defined. It did not pulsate, pulsate, or oscillate.) 25 binoculars revealed no further details.

Mr. Jacobsen took two 35-mm photographs, which had not yet been developed when this report was written. They will show anything more than a dot of light.)

While this was being seen, it was discovered that there was "no reception" on the portable radio. Turning the short-wave radio, with the same results, none of the bands could be picked up — even the government time signals, which invariably came in clearly. But there was one exception: at one frequency a very strong signal was received,rapidly modulating single cycle beats, soon disappearing. Some like the modulations that would have been recognized by pilots in aircraft, without any distinguishing characteristics identifying the transmitter.

As to the frequency, Mr. Jacobsen could not recall the exact figure, but thought it was around 25-30 megacycles (where the major airline and aircraft communications are). So something had apparently been received that week all over the earth, pole to pole.

'Thingnik' sighter Finally Tells Tale 
Of Mysterious Landing to Sheriff
by Peter J. Wissing

CLAYTON, N.M. - Clifford Moore, a ranch hand near this city, said he saw a mysterious object land in a field near his home on Wednesday night.

Moore, who lives about eight miles southwest of Clayton, said the object landed in a field about a quarter of a mile from his home about 11 p.m. 

According to Kenneth Locke, deputy sheriff of Union County, Moore volunteered information about the incident after being questioned by the sheriff's office.

Moore told Locke he observed the object for about 15 minutes. It appeared to be about 50 feet long and 15 feet wide, and was hovering about 10 feet off the ground.

Locke said Moore reported he observed a bright light on the object and that it emitted a humming sound. The object then rose straight up and disappeared, Moore told the officer.

The deputy said Moore was interviewed again Thursday and was asked to take the sheriff's office to the scene, but he was unable to locate the exact spot where the object had landed.

"Locke said Moore made no claims of seeing any creatures or beings in connection with the landing. He explained that Moore said he was "scared to death" during the incident and left the area as soon as the object took off.

Montville 'UFO' Tops Bump
Gosaga County Man Reportedly Talked to Washington Officials
by DAVID VORMELKER

Oden Moore, the Gosaga County man who reported sighting a strange light in the sky near Montville the night of Nov. 8, has just revealed a strange experience he had after his original report.

Moore said he was visited Friday evening by two men who questioned him closely about his observations. He won't say where the visitors were from, but he indicated they were from some government agency.

"They asked me too much," Moore said yesterday. "I won't say anything more."

The report of a strange light in the sky over Montville caused quite a stir. Civil Defense officials said they had no information on it, and the Air Force said it had no planes in the area at the time. Montville residents said the light was brighter than a star, and seemed to hover for several minutes.

Moore, a farmer, said he first spotted the light about 7 p.m. last Saturday. He watched it for 10 to 15 minutes, he said, before it suddenly disappeared.

"It was in the east, and bigger than a star," Moore said. "It kept getting brighter, then dimmer, and then it just disappeared." He said the light did not move, but remained stationary.

After the light disappeared, Moore said he returned to his farmhouse and found two men there who said they represented the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.

"They asked me a lot of questions - too many, I think," Moore said. "They wanted to know exactly what I saw, how long I saw it, and in what direction. They seemed very interested.

"They were very secretive about themselves. They wouldn't say who they were or where they were from. I asked them, but they just smiled and said, 'You know.'"

Moore said the men stayed about an hour, and left without telling him where they were going. He said they acted as if they were in a hurry.

Moore's story has caused quite a bit of speculation in the Montville area. Some residents feel the light may have been a "flying saucer," but others doubt it. Civil Defense officials and Air Force spokesmen said they had no further information on the incident.

Locks uncommunical: Geauga Alive with Probers of Reports on 'Space Crafts'
MONTVILLE - If there was any doubt in the minds of some persons about Geauga County being a hotbed of observation of "space crafts" it was dispelled during the last few days when investigators from the Air Force, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and newspaper reporters converged on the area to check out reports.
A number of persons in the Montville and surrounding area reported seeing strange objects in the sky which they said resembled flying saucers, and these reports brought the investigators into the area.
Some of the persons who reported seeing the objects said they were brilliantly lit and moved at incredible speed. Others said they hovered for a while and then disappeared.
The investigators did not disclose what if any conclusions they reached as a result of their visits, but it is understood that the Air Force is still keeping a close check on reports of "unidentified flying objects" in that section of the country.

of the car, and claim it made a noise like air escaping from a tire. Mr. Cassius Wafner, CD director of the Sheriff's Fire Dept., continued the investigation and states that the object passed overhead at a terrific rate of speed and appeared to be disc-shaped about 50 feet in diameter. Two other parties, he said, also saw the object as it passed overhead and it left an impression of being something very tangible on their minds.

Mr. Warner said that "Moore does not believe it to have been a small plane or helicopter, and has accounted for the damage to the car and the shattered glass. He stated that he saw 4 or 5 of these objects appearing one after another at intervals of about 1 minute.

The Sandoval County Sheriff's office has stated that Mr. and Mrs. Warner had in their possession an object, apparently a portion of the shell of the object that struck and damaged their car. They state that the object is about six inches in diameter and one inch thick and weighs about a pound and a half. It is a dark gray color and seems to be made of some very hard material and shows signs of burning.

Mrs. Warner said she saw a high shiny object that appeared to be about 35 feet in diameter and considerably higher than any plane or jet aircraft she had ever seen. It appeared to be circular in shape and simply disappeared in the sky, she said.

Mims and Mr. Warner said she saw a reddish-orangish object about 50 feet in diameter at an altitude of from 2000 to 3000 feet. This object, she said, appeared to be completely stationary and gave off no exhaust of any kind. This object also suddenly disappeared from sight in a manner that Mrs. Warner said was quite baffling to them. The residents in the area said the object was in sight for about 10 to 15 minutes.

There is a photograph present in the image. The photograph shows what appears to be some kind of unidentified aerial object or "saucer" that was reportedly sent to a CD Head and a mailer was sought.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Photos of 'Saucer' Sent to CD Head; Mailer Sought
JERRY ENGLE, an employe of the Albuquerque Journal, said he took a picture of a flying object from his window in Belen, N.M., last Wednesday. The picture, he said, was sent to this office of the CD (Civil Defense) Head, George Merritt, who referred it to the Air Force for investigation.
Merritt said the letter was from a man in Belen, N.M., who wanted him to take the picture and investigate it for him. The picture, Merritt said, showed an unusual object in the sky. He said the man who took the picture did not want to be identified, but that he would like the Air Force to examine it. 
Merritt said his office had forwarded the picture to the proper authorities.

The image contains a newspaper clipping from what appears to be a UFO reporting document. The clipping has the title "Grow, Spotter Says" and includes a photograph of some kind of unidentified flying object or "space craft". The text describes the witness's account of seeing a strange object in the sky that seemed to be moving and maneuvering in an unusual way.

Grow, Spotter Says
An Otis Barth - a retired Olden, Minn., bachelor - "was quietly relaxing" Sunday evening at his Huntsville, Texas, ranch home when something in the sky caught his attention.
"I was just gazing at the stars when I saw what I first thought was a shooting star," Barth told the Houston Post which related the story Wednesday.
"But as I watched, it seemed to slow down and grow larger. Then it started maneuvering strangely, darting this way and that, hovering and dipping and circling. I had never seen anything like it before."
Barth said the object appeared to be about 60 to 75 feet in diameter. It was shaped something like a flat disc, he said, and gave off an eerie glow or luminescence. 
"There was no sound at all that I could detect from it," Barth said. "It just sort of hovered there and tossed around like a chip in the wind. Then after 10 or 15 minutes, it suddenly took off straight up and was gone in a flash."
Barth said he had no idea of what the object was, but he is convinced it was not an airplane, a meteor, or any other known aerial device.
"I don't understand it at all," he said. "I'm sure I saw some kind of space craft of some kind. I only wish I could figure out what it was and where it came from."

Pass In Review
By Orville Revelle

YOU'VE probably never heard of him. His name is not a household word, like Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill or Hitler. Yet he deserves to have his name remembered, for he made a rather remarkable achievement.

His name is Mr. Moore, about whom you'll be reading more before long, and he recently landed a flying saucer at Roswell, New Mexico.

That's right - Mr. Moore, who was on his way home, deliberately descended from the skies and landed one of those saucers, which have been the subject of so much speculation and mystery.

When he arrived in Roswell, the authorities wanted to question him about the landing, but Mr. Moore said he had instructions not to reveal any details, and he refused to make any statement whatsoever.

President On Right Track
A statement by President Eisenhower stated that he intends to take up to some right way in determining what domestic preparedness measures in the field of continental defense are required to make the nation more secure.

The President said that any decisions he makes will involve the highest technical and military considerations in a way that will not jeopardize our traditional system of self-government.

This new approach, which the President is reported to have accepted, is designed to meet the problems of the kind of world we live in, where the man who leaves the service in good health should be entitled to anything more in the way of government help than the man who is unskilled and untrained.

The President can see, it seems, that the government can actually do more to help the unskilled and untrained than the highly skilled veteran - in the way of vocational training, housing, and economic opportunities.

And this is sure to be consistent with all the present laws that give the government the authority to do anything necessary for continental defense.

THE ABOVE PHOTO (not related to the Moore story, which begins on Page 10), was sent to us by a correspondent in Albany, N.Y. who wishes to remain anonymous. He states that the object was photographed on November 6, 1952 near Albuquerque, N.M. The object was observed to hover and move slowly toward the northwest for several seconds. Our correspondent rushed into the house, secured his camera, and took this picture as the object was moving away slowly toward the northwest.

SAUCER NEWS COMMENTS

Readers of SAUCER NEWS will recall the long-standing feud between us and Mr. Barker in Clarksburg, West Virginia. A serious controversy was entered into between him and his cohorts, and we became engaged in some rather heated disputes which lasted for many months. 

His article, for the issue of 1956, of SAUCERIAN BULLETIN, crowed our and our friends' efforts and we made a fair reply to Mr. Barker's most generous offer, whereby we would combine his magazine with ours. This was further followed in the issues of SAUCERIAN BULLETIN, wherein we attempted to incorporate their subscribers into our operations, as an act of generosity, extended according to the number of "Saucerian Bulletins" owned by them. 

Any portion of the SAUCERIAN BULLETIN subscription that has not been served out by refund on the unused portion, will be resolved by sending SAUCER NEWS for the remainder of the time. Their new contained publication matters should be applied to SAUCER NEWS.

SAUCER NEWS has become the second oldest FLYING SAUCER periodical in the world, exceeded only by "Flying Saucers" magazine, published slightly under 8,000 copies, our determination. Long expressed, to consolidate other publications into SAUCER NEWS, has been gradually moving toward that idea. Commencing June, September and December of each year, former readers of the publications absorbed will be handled promptly by us. 

In the June, 1957, the first issue of SAUCER NEWS was published quarterly. Our policy will remain the same as stated, resolving any complaints that may come, in the future, through the editors. We believe that the interplanetary explanation is the most likely, but the (obscured) space ships should include the matter of the missing links, representing thousands of years of advanced progress, as some viewpoints indicate in their signed articles, whether or not they wish to be associated with the Barker or Zret (?) ideas and every controversy related to the flying saucer mystery. We will continue to publish authenticatable facts from Clarksburg, and readers interested in these books should write directly to us, at P.O. Box 228, Clarksburg, W. Va. The matter to be resolved is whether the articles published heretofore by Mr. Barker appears on Page 13 of this issue, and he will continue to contribute articles relating to his activities with, what he calls "Saucerian Bulletin," until suspended in 1957. 

After most a full year before the first issue of our magazine, then called "Saucers," our efforts gave the public their first information to the public in those early days. We are grateful to Mr. Barker that his efforts will help to solicit our SAUCER NEWS STAFF, and we feel that his efforts will help to make our magazine more interesting in the future than it has been in the past.

It takes level-headed people, like you, to run a magazine such as SAUCER NEWS. As a subject where there is so much confusing evidence to sort out, a clear head and a rational presentation must be maintained. There are some minds that will accept a mystic ally Richard Oden, there are some minds that will accept a machine-tooled presentation. But both minds must be reached with a reasonable, factual publication, void of hocus-pocus & far-fetched ideas about the Jews cancel each other out. For instance: All capitalists, or the ruling establishment, are really Communists. All the evidences about the Jews are promoted by communists! It is because they have so much influence with Air Force Intelligence, it couldn't escape them to do so.

In one of the changes you made it was made quite clear and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you. The edited sentences we asked for were used, and we are grateful that you so graciously complied with our request. Also, we ask you to consider this request - could you publish this article again, without identifying certain individuals mentioned? The reason for this is that the article is very good research, and we feel that the publication of their names would serve no useful purpose, and may cause some individuals to cease all further investigation and research.
All was meant to convey the idea that the phenomena, although objective, transcends our human limitations, and as the psychic component of experience.
In Part Two (the March issue, page 12) you published this statement: "The issue you have a request concerning, will be the last one to have this subject made readable - as the subscriptional numbers dropped substantially." We understand your position, but at the same time feel that the exclusion from the records of the unusual sightings would be a real loss to serious students and researchers.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

"this component cannot be rationalised away." My actual statement read: "And this is the fact that it is not reasonable -- it exhibits a psychic component which cannot be rationalised away." Here you have changed "a psychic" to "of the saucer phenomena." The only reason I say that they were open to the physio-psychic phenomenon which is recognized as "truth, is the manner of their investigator's final determination was phenomenon. THOMAS M. GORILLA

Mr. Gorilla has devoted an objective analysis of the flying "saucer" mystery. It is it has developed within the past sixteen years. I think that he is correct in thinking that the solution cannot definitely established is to these observations for I happen to be inclinerL.

ROBERT D. NULL
Maiden, North Carolina

It is perhaps true enough that conclusion jumping on the basis of insufficient observation data in UFO field is contributing that this type of work. But you are very wrong in thinking that no one really has the evidences for the saucers' behavior. Your ignorance of evidence in civilian researchers from the early period is a proof your unsuitability as a searcher to figure the whole thing out with reasonable accuracy.

As the two particular articles have the answer, and is unable to figure it out. Mr. Gorilla has no qualifications to pass on the subject of which he talks, and his statements are therefore merely his personal opinion.

PAUL W. HAMMER
Chicago, Illinois

I didn't have to go far into Gorilla's articles to realize he would soon invoke the psychic. His psychic, or other, just as an aptest mine not to rely on it. But he seems to go psychic for a pretty poor reason. Apparent lack of physical evidence for the saucer phenomena. This is not enough, it it simply that we senseless.....over 12 years of close association with aircraft and aviation, I have witnessed that anomolous things cannot always be a purely physical phenomenon and seen an aircraft. Takes away all their news sources and the would doubt-less than the current thinking that is the reasonable perfect. But their opinion.

Can give your December and March issues with much interest. I good job. However to confirm a public opinion of ours in view side o£ the controversy regarding NICAP. After looking at my letters which you published, I still hold that I was right in believing that the discloses should not have been made. However, you have not convinced me that NICAP is warranted in withholding information which the public should have. As I told you at the time, you know quite well that we aren't opposed to each other that much. Perhaps you could tell your readers this.

The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document discussing various topics related to UFO research and the NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) organization.

Text output from the document:

As a NICAP member, I am indeed surprised and quite disturbed to see so much of NICAP's confidential material appearing in the SAUCER NEWS, as I can tell this material has done more for civilian research than any other UFO group. Its director, Major Keyhoe, has done more to bring this subject to the public than any other individual. 

Regarding Major Keyhoe's letter in the March SAUCER NEWS, what does it contain, besides exposing an unauthorized letter for his claim that NICAP is abusing the privilege of using his material? I can see two reasons: First, secondly, SAUCER NEWS is not the place to shed tears about this. Nobody is interested in SAUCER NEWS personal fratching and distortions.

Regarding the Hart and Coleman letters in your December issue, Mr. Joe Hart suggests a correspondence regarding flying saucers, but the Air Force denies this. This may be, but the Air Force dispatches reaching this area substantiate the relations the Air Force and itself has with NICAP already. The Air Force continually make statements heading that NICAP quoted. Part seems to be hit-picking here. As for the Coleman letter, the NICAP counsel assured him that these questions were not for publicity and asked for his co-operation, so they could continue their persistent queries about "Flying Saucers and the U.S. Air Force...".

Regarding Mr. Gribble's plaintive howl (in your Dec. issue) or any explanation for deliberately setting up and widely publicizing an organization such as NICAP would be contrary to Gribble's own published article in a magazine called "Confidence". This is described as listing retired admirals, airline pilots, college professors and a number of people, which according to Gribble is for NICAP's advisory staff. This is not unlike the man on NICAP who used to board and Panel who freely identified that this man on the panel was none other than Major Keyhoe. It seems to me this path was more accurate than it is described when it described Mr. Gribble as "a one-man data processing".

Congratulations. You picked a very fine, intelligent lady for your companion in life. May you be happy through the end of time. That wishes to.

Text from the document:

BOTH OF YOU. I hope to see you sometime in the future again, when I am up your way....  Regarding the fact that someone sent you a "Voodoo doll", I would say that you and your wife should not fear that, for they would not do any harm at all. The object is not to tear people down, but to uplift, even the lowest creature which it possesses. If this is done as it was intended, it should bring much goodness to you. Then I received your SAUCER NEWS and found that you are not making any great claims as to what you have seen. This is wise, for many things which others call miraculous are really quite simple to those who have some understanding of the various forces at work. If someone must be thinking this dirty work – someone who attempts to harm – I would like to know, wouldn't you? If there is nothing wrong, why fear? So let's take this in the highest sense and know that we are establishing a friendship, each with the other. I wish there were more people like you, who come out into the open instead of hiding behind "closed doors". I had on Long John's radio program, the finest get-together that anyone could have. The public for the most part were wonderful people who responded far more than you perhaps could. SAUCERS are far more wonderful than you can imagine. HOOP ADAMS PHOTO CALIFORNIA

Here is the information you requested (March SAUCER NEWS, Page 14) concerning the moons of Mars: 

Swift	Actual
Moons:	2	2
Distance from Mars' center, in terms of Mars' diameter: 	1.4	3.8
Deimost:	3 hrs.	7 hrs. 39 min.
Time for one revolution around Mars: 	30 hrs. 18 min.	30 hrs. 18 min.

The Swift was remarkably accurate in its predictions regarding the moons of Mars. His 1877 discovery of these moons close to the planet was a feat of outstanding observation and calculation. He guessed the number exactly, though he erred somewhat in the distance from the planet's center. His estimate of the period of revolution was very close to the actual. Thus his work in this field remains a notable achievement of 19th century astronomy.

Anyone who suggested in your book review (March SAUCER NEWS, Page 7) that those who look into SAUCERS are strange or abnormal folk, simply does not understand. This is exactly what I'm going to do here. Then he speaks of "a spiritualised life". Well, this is paramount with those who give earnest attention to this intriguing subject. For in it we live and move and have our being. "In Him", of course, means when we live in harmony with the laws of the universe. MRS. EVA MAHLE, Connersville, Indiana

Text from the document:

At 9:25 the object was beginning to float slowly upwards and move off to the south, over a trackless area of lake and forest. It had entered the clouds and was out of sight. The radio batteries were now tried again, and proved to work normally; the batteries had apparently not affected by the episode.
The four hunters bolted the cabin door and loaded all their guns before going to bed.
Before their return to New York, the party heard of three more UFO observations (details omitted). 
On Saturday the 5th, the hunters drove back to New York. Shortly before noon they passed through Plattsburgh, N.Y. Here they heard the local radio station reporting that a Plattsburgh citizen of the highest reputation had had his car stalled on the radio-radie highway, hovering directly overhead. According to the station's report, this one was "spaced out" differently from the others, but this one was reported to the same source. 
The four hunters stopped for lunch at Schroon Lake, 75 miles south of Plattsburgh. Had the croppers seen anything on the evening of the 5th? They certainly had: a metallic-looking sphere had hovered over five of ten minutes directly over their barracks, and had stopped cars in Schroon Lake. The croppers had also talked to jet pilots from Plattsburgh (as in Shambrige) and been shown up about the objects on that day, who, with them - "we don't mind chasing bombers or fighters," if they had said, "but we don't like to chase these damn saucers, because we don't know what they can do."
Mr. Jacobsen's mother told us that when he returned home, he was "shaken."
As far as the Los Alamos is concerned, such a possibility is totally out of the question. The veracity of Mr. Jacobsen is beyond doubt.

THE MOSELEY MOORE STORY
By C. W. Fish

In the September 1962 issue of SAUCER NEWS, Mr. Moseley gave a long account of his interview with Lt. Comdr. J. L. Moser, a pilot for the Air Force's UFO investigation center at Wright-Patterson Field, Dayton, Ohio.
This article is believed to be an open and fair admission concerning the questions of attitudes, difficulties, and limitations of the official Air Force UFO investigation. It is the story told to Mr. Moseley by a responsible Air Force officer (name known to me) who made an important and apparently truthful statement during this interview concerning UFO sightings and the attitude of the Air Force toward them. He made these statements to friends and eventually on tape; and has since been transferred out of the UFO investigation against his wishes.
The fellow admitted in private that they were not at all sure what the objects were and would not say they were sure, yet publicly they were still claiming it was all nothing but hoaxes and misidentifications. The public statements about these wild claims were not borne out by the facts according to Mr. Moseley.
It is my purpose in this article to set the record straight. The name of the Air Force officer in this story is Capt. J. L. Moser. He appeared in the November 1959 issue of SAUCER NEWS (now out of print) Moser made a very close sighting of a UFO while driving his car along Route 68, near Xenia, Ohio. When he noticed what he at first took to be a high-flying jet, it suddenly shot straight up and out of sight.
Moser stopped, said Moseley (as quoted in one of the local newspapers): "The object stopped 15 feet off the ground, and then it speeded up and went straight up, and it kept going until I couldn't see it anymore." The star appeared brighter than anything I'd ever seen. As I got out to take a look, the thing seemed to be motionless. Moser watched the thing for some fifteen minutes before it just took off at tremendous speed and was gone. "I didn't hear any sound from it at all," Moser said. There was no a glow or trail left behind, "just a fast disappearance." Moser thinks he is one of the few persons who has actually seen a UFO at close quarters. He landed UFO when he stopped and decided that he would go back to his car and report the incident.

return to the spot with witnesses, as no one would believe him otherwise. He got to his car, got his wife, and went again to the spot where he had seen the object. He wanted to get his wife to see it also. But by that time the object was gone. he had seemed to get his wife however. He went home, and returned to the spot where he had seen the object but by that time the object was gone. Moore stated that the object was 50 feet in diameter, disc shaped, and about 15 feet thick, with a cone on the top, making it overall about 20 feet high. It was glowing a reddish color and the surface seemed to be metallic and like a mirror. The object was unusually bright, that night, and it was the moonlight that made it so, according to Moore. The object hung motionlessly for several minutes, and then took off silently at a terrific speed towards the southwest. Two county officials were notified of the sighting the following day. The field was subsequently searched and holes in the ground like those made by a heavy object landing were found. The Bernalillo County Civil Defense. returned to headquarters to get a geiger counter. When we reached the spot again, the geiger counter showed a higher reading at certain areas along the perimeter! Waiting a few hours, Locke and Reineck took another reading at the same points. The reading was only 10-20% lower, indicating the residual radiation had not dissipated appreciably. Since this indicated that the reaction on the geiger counter was not caused by natural background radiation, it was widely published at the time. The sketch below, however, is Moore's own original drawing, which he gave to me.

The text in the document is as follows:

The saucer is the darkened area within the geometric construction lines Moore used to draw Mr. Moore's signature in the bottom of this photo. This was taken in the fall of 1962, and has never been published before. It was among the first to interview him after his sighting in November 1957. And he mentioned not being able to bring some of the matters pertaining to UFO's before his sighting; but from that time on, he was quite outspoken. Continued investigation 5 was made with him in his home. He wanted to be very careful in his statements and to allow 'I don't know' answers. He just wasn't the kind to make up fanciful stories of any sort. He was very active in observation work and reported more sightings in that matter than I cared to check.He had been flown to Washington and interviewed there for two days and returned home on the third day. He said that Captain Nicholas had told them that they had a lot about it and gave them to me. Naturally, these would have been assumed names. In any case, if they couldn't identify him, I wasn't going to give them the true information. This particular approach in my efforts to authenticate Moore's story. However, Doerge said Budinger's building in Washington - one of the two stops for gas were made by the Air Force car in which he was being driven around New York - for a small building. When I showed the pictures to Gillian later, he quickly identified the State Police station and said that was where he had been remembered stopping in that town and got a Coke. It turned out to be opposite the Ease Station where we were waiting for him. The United States Coast House where I had some other officials came out of the building, and we didn't see the gentleman at all. The Ease station in question is right across the street.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing typed text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

slides were taken of various UFO still photographs. They were run off a UFO microfilm, which had apparently been taken in Albuquerque earlier and from which Moore had obtained the information. Most of the slides had pointed domes, such as the one he had been shown. Moore was asked if he would not reveal the fact that he had been shown this evidence of the existence of UFOs. He refused to do so, however, as he stated that he would not conceal the fact that he had been shown this evidence of the existence of UFOs, and that he could not cure himself of the idea that they must therefore be from another planet, coming into our atmosphere from outer space.

At my request, Moore gave me exactly how he had been taken to Washington. He told me that a man who lived in Washington had called him on the telephone and asked him if he would come to Washington, as the Air Force wanted to see him. This was the first time he had been asked to come to Washington. Upon his arrival there, he was told exactly what had happened:

Louis Rubendall, Saturday, November 10, 1957, Geauga County Sheriff and Air Force Lieutenant who stated he was from Youngstown (Ohio) - called on Moore at his home. Sheriff Rubendall told Moore that he had been instructed by the commanding officer at the airbase near Youngstown to go to Moore's home and get the slides and the report, which Moore had made. He added that he felt it was Moore's duty as a citizen to do as they requested. They had to have the slides and the report, as it was necessary for their records. They had to have the information that Moore had obtained. He told Moore that they drove him to the very same field where he had seen the UFO land. This was the evidence that Moore had been shown in Albuquerque, and they wanted the slides and the report. Moore said that two Air Force men accompanied him to Youngstown. On their arrival at the base near Youngstown, a major questioned him closely about what he had seen and the details of his experience. After his questioning, he was released and he arrived home about 11 p.m.

On Air Force car with two officers came to Moore's home. This time he was instructed by one of the officers that he was not to washington for two hours, and promptly at 7 p.m. they did return. The officers told Moore that they had already processed the slides and the report, and that they would not need the originals, and that Moore could keep them. One of the officers told him then that he picked up another Air Force officer in Youngstown and that they had brought the slides and the report to the Air Force building where he was housed throughout his stay there. Two or three days later, before going to sleep at night, he wondered why the government had selected him to take this information, and that they had been sworn to secrecy. It was his belief that he was told that the information about his having seen a UFO land had already been given to Washington. While he was en route to Washington, he was told a friend of his, Capt. the husband of his girl friend, had called the commanding officer at the base and had picked the story up. Moore later admitted to having gone to Washington, but he did not tell me what he had told them.

The image contains a text passage, but does not appear to contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

simply stating that he had been sworn to secrecy as to what had happened in March of 1959. Mrs. Moore sent me a copy of an air force letter that she had received from Capt. Eddie Pederson, and that is what she told me had been told to her - that she would not divulge this information about it, and that it seemed to her that Olden had confirmed the fact that a saucer researcher named Frank Halstead (Olden's colleague at that time) had convinced him, after he, Olden, had somehow become convinced that on that occasion Mrs. Moore had made the tape, to please Halstead, and the tape was subsequently sent to officials to defend the air force - the cause of this tape that the two officers from Wright-Pattèrson AFB told Olden was the result of confusion into which they had been led, resulting from the contact between Mr. Moseley and Col. Friend. Officers from Wright Field told Olden that what had happened on rare occasions these huge fireballs were seen for periods of over a minute, but that were no photo from Mr. Moseley or Mrs. Moore - they only said that on some of the occasions the huge fireballs were seen, and that Olden told me that while he let the officers think they had convinced him, he told mere that he knew I was right - that there was no fireballs! But Olden told me that what he did think they had convinced him of was that Mrs. Moore actually thought she saw the objects, hut that it wasn't any fireballs or that sort of thing - that what they thought were fireballs was actually the reflection of the moonlight on the objects' mirror-like surface. It wasn't any fireballs at all, as Mrs. Moore was thinly led to believe - as the officers told Olden that they had concluded. The mystery, he inferred, was what really took place at the time of Moore's sighting. If this is the case, then, he readily thinking he between all the officers - perhaps my personal knowlenge of Olden was incorrect of his methods of solvine ases had been given to him by someone else. The officers from Wright Patterson had persuaded Olden to Washington D.C. and had shielded the facts from Moseley. There is no doubt in my mind that Olden Moore the truth!

THE MYSTERY OF THE DISAPPEARING PLANES

Readers of Major Donald Keyhoe's book "The Flying Saucer Conspiracy" will recall the story of a routine patrol flight from the U.S. Naval Air Station at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Dec. 5, 1948. It seems that three separate planes on that flight suddenly vanished and were never seen or heard from again. This disappearance has been called "one of the greatest and most incredible mysteries in aviation history." It is from the latter source that the following article has been condensed.

- page 31 -

The image contains a sketch of a UFO or unidentified flying object. The sketch shows a triangular or saucer-shaped object in the sky over what appears to be a landscape.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

return to the spot with witnesses, as no one would believe his otherwise. He would at first not identify it, However, he went home to get his wire, and returned to the spot with her, but by that time about 20 minutes had elapsed. 

The object made that this spot in diameter, had a slant toward the top, and was about 15 feet 30 feet. It was saucer-shaped, like a plate, was surrounded by a white "glow", and as it hovered there was no sound, similar to this description that might, and, it was the moonlight. The UFO had a definite outline.

The area itself was not suitable for landing, being rocky. County officials were notified of the sighting the following day.

and Lake County U.D. Defense Director Gleeson Finney reported the following: That night officers traced the object to a higher field one mile away. There they found two oblong holes in the ground like those made by displaced soil. Area Civil Defense returned to headquarters to get a Geiger counter. When we made readings on the soil in the field, the count was slightly higher than normal background readings in the vicinity. Waiting a few hours, Looks and Reeves took another reading in the same spot, and the count had lowered to normal, indicating that the reaction on the Geiger counter was not caused by radioactivity.

This incident indicated that the reaction on the Geiger counter was not caused by radioactivity. And were widely published at the time. The sketch below, however, is Moore's own original artistic drawing, which he save to me.

The flight took off at 2 p.m. At 3:43 they were expected to call in, but the message received at that time was anything but a routine one: "This is an emergency, it is said in part, and even with radio distortion there was something quite unusual in the flight". We can't be sure where we are... We don't know which way we went, the captain explained. We cannot be sure of our position... We can't be sure where we are... We don't know... We cannot be sure of our position... Where are we?... We don't know".

The ocean doesn't look as it should... The sun was traveling in the western horizon, and it was incredible... only a visual observation. For the next forty-five minutes Apparently none of the five had any idea of their position. The over-head conversations showed increasing desperation, which way are we going, where are we?... It seems we are lost... Things that no other plane has ever encountered... This in itself was a most unusual set, and showed a desperately grave emergency of the flight. It said: "We are not certain where we are... Must be about 225 miles northeast of where we were". The message broke off at that point.

Immediately thereafter, a Martin flying boat with full rescue equipment and a crew of five arrived on the scene. Neither this plane nor the original five Avenger bombers were ever heard from again, nor was any distress signal ever received from them. The message received the day of the flight, by mid-afternoon of the next day, many ships and over 300 planes had joined the desperate hunt for rescue, or dooms. The Navy's information of the incident, in which a total of 27 lives were lost, unable to come up with any explanation of what happened...".

16.
PASSENGERS and six crew members were on board this flight, on route to KINGMAN, ARIZ, from LAS VEGAS, NEV. A routine report when landing at KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE indicated a crash take-Off and landing of a plane, supposedly from the huge airliner. No trace was ever found indicating a crash had occurred. An investigation as to what had happened, if anything was ever located, but no evidence of any kind was ever located. 
According to information later obtained on January 11th, 1949, a Boeing 377 passenger plane, also known as the stratocruiser, this too was a four-engined on route to Japan carrying military passengers. then silence, As in the other cases, the aircraft disappeared completely from the four control radio contact.   
The wreckage of the aircraft was never found. A thorough investigation of these two incidents, similar to the investigation that the U.S. Navy had made concerning our 1112 students (sic) from the airplane already mentioned, does not seem to have been made. No scientific explanation of this could be found. 
We can but postulate, as to the nature of the strange phenomena, off the Florida coast, commercial pilots are reluctant to discuss the matter which in their minds suggests something beyond the range of present human knowledge. Is to be branded a crackpot and persona non grata in certain circles from what they dare to relate, what may be facts that planes fly into and can't get out of. Perhaps the missing aircraft are moved showed into the clouds or into another dimension.
The most chilling story of all, in support of the above theory, concerns a similar flight in January 1948, when an aircraft mysteriously disappeared through clouds, one day when he suddenly came upon a strange object. He collided with it, crashed the object the wreckage of which was not found, but his wincipc new-wood job obviously of pre-World War II vintage. The pilot of the ancient aircraft was found as he the custom in those days, sitting in an upright position, strapped to the controls. The plane was not seriously damaged, and disappeared into the clouds. The pilot's (name) survives down to the present time, (or even that such a plane was licensed, as in the other words, the near-disastrous scrubbed by the modern pilot was found a month or so later under a stack of junk, in a hangar where it had been hastily hidden and forgotten. The log was description of a near-disaster with a weird silver airplane. The log book was turned over to the authorities, who made no evaluation of it. (word censored) and the (name censored) were enough they this was a long scrape along one side of it, just where the log's narrative said there had been hit. The whole incident has been investigated by the Civil Aeronautics Board, but they can't find any way to explain it.

Here is the text output from the OCR:

Sputnik II
Spotted
Upstate
Upstate "moomwatchers" reported today they got a "clear view" of Sputnik II passing across the sky about an hour before going out of sight.
Sputnik II's passage came from southwest to northeast at about 6:17 p.m. (chme)., the Indianapolis time announced. It would be visible.
SEVERAL Goshen residents reported seeing a bright white light moving from southwest to northeast. The Smithsonian Institute in Washington had announced it would be visible.
The announcement of Sputnik II's flight had been made in Des Moines at that moment.
In the department of unidentified flying objects, too, residents got into the act over Newcastle.
At Newcastle a group in route home from a school athletic game told The Indianapolis Times the object they saw "broke into two smaller objects." Mrs. Barlow, New Iberia, said she and her two children said the object "hovered over their automobile" as they were driving home from the game between Straughn and Atlanta.
After illuminating the sky, the object, Barlow said, went out of sight. Several other parties, including one in which a basketball coach at Straughn was riding, stopped while the incident occurred, gazed at the object.
MRS. BARLOW said the object "came suddenly down, made a sharp turn and then hovered above the car and made no sound close enough to hit with a BR gun."
Finally, the object moved upward and divided by at least two smaller objects, Mrs. Barlow said.

THE END OF AN ERA
- By Orfeo Angelucci -

In September, 1955, a new type of publication appeared. It pressumed to replace on flying saucers. It was called "The Saucerian".

"The Saucerian" was cranked out once a month. The first three issues were crammed with articles, some of which, in the editor's opinion, were worth reading. Soon people, by some way or another, heard of the publication and subscribed to it. Within a short time, the circulation continued to increase, until the present total of around 1,500 was reached.

"The Saucerian Bulletin", always appeared on newsstands, and was made up by putting in funds from my theatre film booking business. Later, when I gave up the theatre, the news came that "The Saucerian Bulletin" was continued to published monthly.

In the past three years a great new interest has almost obsessed me - that of understanding out human origin, and our place in the cosmos.

For sometime, "The Saucerian" has been published most irregularly, with the editor feeling unable to give it the full understanding to the subscribers to which they were entitled. With my other business interests, I felt that I could not devote the time required to publish the magazine regularly, and to give the subscribers the same good service. With very little notice, the publication will now cease.

I shall publish just occasional weightier and more important works to satisfy that interest which I have found most subscribers share with me - that of understanding our human origin and destiny. I should concentrate on research and release material of a more profound and lasting nature.

Some time ago, James W. Moseley, hearing of some of my difficulties, offered to consider consolidating "SAUCER NEWS" with "The Saucerian Bulletin". It was agreed that SAUCER NEWS would continue, even though a great many other saucer magazines were passing from the scene, possibly due to lack of editorial material, while The Saucerian Bulletin was to be merged with SAUCER NEWS. However, although we agreed that it would not take the responsibility of forming policy, special interest in "The Saucerian Bulletin" did arise. In the past two years, his editorial policy has become more conservative, and the liberal, uncensored and free thought which my publication had carried as a main characteristic, has dwindled. Instances of perpetuation, but "Frankly SAUCER NEWS" was the only "regularly published" magazine.

I feel that I could continue undertaking, and I should, therefore, desist from doing so. Recently when Mr. Moseley dropped by Clarksburg, we talked this matter over, and I decided, finally, to cease publishing "The Saucerian Bulletin."

This decision was not an easy one, but with the cessation of "The Saucerian Bulletin" as a separate entity, SAUCER NEWS will now remain as the sole regularly published magazine devoted to flying saucers and related phenomena.

Text extracted from the document:

We have reached the end of an era. It has been a decade of great satisfaction in the saucer field to publish full-length books "about" the subject. Books are gradually more cautious. Magazines cannot be much more restrained. Since we began our publishing activities in the book field, we have had to follow the rather strict policy of Dr. Donald Menzel, who stated in his book "The Saucer People" by Brinsley Le Poer Trench that "the saucers were undoubtedly a psychological phenomenon". The saucerian bulletin rests on other very capable shoulders. We regret the loss of Dr. Donald Menzel's leadership, and we hope that the brilliant work of his associates will be recognized and their efforts further stimulated. RECENT UFO STORIES

SAUCER NEWS EDITOR JOINS EXPEDITION TO NEW MEXICO CAVES: Not long ago we received a letter from Mr. LaPaz in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In it he describes a most unusual expedition he has planned for early June. He has invited certain members of our organization. The latter from Mr. LaPaz states: "There is a strange cave somewhere near this locale. Two discs of car headlight diameter have been reported coming out of this cave. A few feet in the mouth of the cave, the discs appear and then disappear. Approximately 70 persons have witnessed this phenomenon. Just upon the spine that no one was able to go down any further." Each individual invited will be guests of Mr. LaPaz for several days. We would not be shocked if it was accepted, that members of the expedition will be allowed to take photographs of whatever is seen. And to write up their experiences for SAUCER NEWS. Don't miss it!

EXCLUSIVE REPORT ON SOUTH AMERICAN SAUCER "FLAP": As announced in our two previous issues, a continuing saucer "flap" seems to be taking place in South America. Unfortunately details are lacking somewhat as to the full extent. However, we will keep you up to date. Even though practically no mention of the South American saucers flap has been made in the press, indications point to something quite "big" down there.

On the night of January 30th, more than a dozen people in Ica, Peru, saw a brilliant-white luminous object hover and maneuver in the sky. It was visible for approximately 30 minutes. Other sightings were made during January in San Juan and other parts of Peru. Flying saucers seen near Parmana, Argentina, in January, are said to have emitted "strange particles" which in analysis were found to be radioactive.

Some of these strange particles were collected and were found to be radioactive.

- page 38 -

The image contains a photograph that appears to be taken from a report related to Project Blue Book. The photograph shows two circular objects with markings on them. The text below the image discusses details about the sighting, including the location, date, and witnesses' descriptions.

In Asuncion, Paraguay, a sighting was reported on February 7th by a student, Hector Torres, who saw a UFO land near a local school. The sighting was made by several other observers as well. The report states that the UFO was observed at high velocity, and five photographs of the UFO were taken in quick succession on the 8th of February. These photographs were published in the February 15th edition of "La Gaceta," a Tucuman newspaper.

The report also discusses a sighting that occurred in Tacuara, Paraguay, where "strange objects" were observed flying at relatively low speed at a distance of a half mile or so from the witnesses. A farmer named Ricardo Lopez, who lived a few miles from Tacuara, photographed these objects, and the report states that one meter is about equal to one yard. Lopez took several photographs, and the report states that a temperature of over 200 degrees Celsius had been placed on top of it, indicating that the objects were affected by extreme heat.

The report also mentions that sightings were made during January, and on the night of January 23rd, a huge object was sighted by a bus driver in Asuncion, Paraguay. The report states that the object was disc-shaped, with a white cabin, and several witnesses described it as being "cloud-shaped." The report also mentions that the object was observed for about an hour, during which it remained stationary above the vehicle.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no visible photograph in this particular page.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

The UFO appeared visually as a luminous object with a tall or some sort. The pictures, taken at an exposure of five minutes, show an object much longer than it actually was, due to the object's movement during the exposure.

NEWS BRIEFS:

Pieve di Sacco, Italy, - a young pilot named Mario Salviato photographed a flying saucer and one of its occupants. He says he was walking along a country road when a luminous object descended near him, round luminous object with a dome on top. He managed to take four pictures while the man climbed into the saucer and took off. The pictures "are quite sensational" - they show an "egg-shaped" object and a man-like figure. The photos were examined by many experts in Italy and were considered genuine.

Two Texas businessmen claim they saw a fluorescent circular light behind their automobile on the night of February 6th. Near Washington, D.C. on the same night, a couple in an automobile also reported seeing a similar object hovering near their car. The director of the space sciences program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, stated last December "it is increasingly difficult to dismiss UFO reports entirely."

Unidentified flying objects have been sighted by hundreds of persons in the Hawaiian islands. The reports indicate that the objects were traveling at very high altitudes and speeds. The high rate of speed was sighted by hundreds of persons in the Hawaiian islands. The objects were traveling at an estimated altitude of 40,000 feet. Honolulu newspapers and radio stations were flooded with calls from persons who had seen the UFOs. A provision must now be made to plan for the possible creation of "existing and thinking beings" which may soon be discovered by higher-powered telescopes.

Text from the document:

FORTUNE ITEMS: The Smithsonian Institute recently set up an elaborate rate system of cameras and other electronic devices in an endeavor to study and record any Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) that might appear in the area. Hundreds of people have been witness to these strange objects and it is estimated that over 200 men are working on this project. A scientific committee has been formed to study any information gathered from this elaborate setup.

the category of "mysterious disappearances" come this story from Linnipstown Township, New Jersey. On March 18th a 23 year old boy who had been left for only a few minutes to play with his brother and voluntaries have searched every inch of the southern New Jersey township, yet he was never found. Repeated effortty others to find the sounds of house have met with no success. People throughout the house due to the careless bag with the condition which perhaps have been done of the dents in the wall and the fresh paint on the door, more than a week later his mother made her scalp tingld. Other citizens have joined the family searching the house for possible clues. A Norwegian explorer says he has found positive evidence that the New World. Carbon 14 tests have succeeded in dating a primitive forrest calls, and plant life to an age of 300,000 years before Columbus landed in the West Indies. On March 7th,1957, state trooper T.H. Blankenship, while investigating a 6-pound chunk of iron crashed through the roof of an auto parked in the yard of Bill Mason, whose residence is about a mile from the spot where the chunk landed. Blankenship said the iron was not generally used in aircraft and appeared as if it fell from a tree, which scientists claim to have brought two prehistoric tritons (vertebrates resembling lampreys) according to recent reports. One of the animals lived for five weeks, and slept for three weeks. BY BOOK REVIEW (Note: In spite of our recent review, we still feel obliged to give our frank opinions about all current books, including those published by Hauserianbooks.) BENDER MYSTERY CONTINUED - edited by Gray Barker (Published by Saucerian Books) "This book is a collection of letters from Gray Barker from a number of people who read Albert K. Bender's "Flying Saucers and the Three Men" which was published in 1962. Little headlight would be shed upon our understanding of the Bender book or to our understanding of the saucer mystery in general. All the way from subtle hints to direct statements, it is clear that Barker intends to withhold from us any knowledge that might emanate from the Bender case. This effort appears to be a literary work, for the publication of letters carries "the duty of creating a literary work".

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

presentation without editing, except in the most minor degree. It is unfortunate that this Report does not contain editing; Chapter 16, entitled "Were Sander's Experiences Psychological?", appears to consist of long letters from this individual to the Hender Mystery Conductor. The correspondence indicates that Sander's opinions on the Bender case are so strange and his content that they view little doubt that they are "rather fanciful" than a reflection of the realities of the case. Sander's personal investigations seem to be largely confirmatory, rather than contributing new facts, reads in parts after my collapse, or rather during it. After the sight that it was a situation like a TV set was was hooked up to the police station, it was told he was told it was the product of a hallucination. Some strange lamps and lamp bulb... The are, however, more lucid letters than this. The consensus of opinion is, as I am willing the truth as he knows it. But perhaps the alleged space people are deceiving him, or perhaps the identity, or giving his views is some erroneous Race... Deros, the Black Brotherhood, Communist agents, and other such groups; One woman writes that on reading the first few pages of the report, she supposed it to be fiction, until the last line or Parker's "Promotion Circulars" is headline "Should You Burn "the Bender Saga 177". Now, how promotion circulars in a book should not, but many readers will surely do a slow burn when they read its sequel.

UIO WARNING by John Stuart (Published by Saucerian Books, Clarksburg, W. Va.)

Although we have long suspected that there is often more than a slight connection between flying saucer phenomena and some sex crimes, we were not sure about this theory until reading John Stuart's "UFO Warning." Mr. Stuart's views, after being expanded somewhat, seem to coincide almost entirely with those of my own group, which consisted of exactly two members - himself and an attractive young lady named Maitland, who spent a great deal of time thinking about the UFO problem. The details of the case are not clear, as she is barely mentioned in the book.

Apparently the lady investigators appeared on the lawn and apparently were unable to move. Just as it seemed about to attack the female half of this organization. It glided downward and hovered close, then suddenly shot away into the darkness. The invisible attackers, it left her body covered with strange scratches, which the doctor claimed came from "claws" rather than human hands. Later in the book, Mr. Stuart says he went away to Auckland and stayed with my old mother, resting my nerves. One wonders in just what way he is underhanding this promotion, and I doubt if many others can either. This is a detective part of the huge mass of jarring data which comes the two enigmas.

The image contains a photograph depicting a boy's account of seeing a "four on space ship" in Knoxville, Tennessee. The text describes the boy's story, including that he saw a UFO about 10 feet from where he was standing, with the object being about 24 feet wide at its widest portion. The text also mentions that the boy's parents corroborated his story, which was later reported to the sheriff and published in the local newspaper.

Text extracted from the document:

"BOY 'SEES' FOUR ON SPACE SHIP
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - An 11-year-old boy identified as Everett Hughes, a student in the Holston Grade School, is getting more exciting television reaction to the small fry saucer he reported to the sheriff. His school principal and a newspaper reporter interviewed the boy who said he saw a strange silvery object 10 feet from the window of his home when a "there and round shape ship" crossed the road. 
Out of the unidentified flying ship, said the boy, came four German soldiers in war regalia. He said it took off like a helicopter after the four got in. His story had such a ring of sincerity to it that the Knoxville News-Sentinel and Photographier Bill P. Evanschitzky are planning to interview the boy later to the pasture. 
"I saw something which I seem to see all the time," the boy said, "About 10 feet from where Everett was standing in the thick grass. Everett did not point it out." 
"It was in the shape of a fat cigar or a slender egg. I think it was about 24 feet wide at the thickest portion.""

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was the United States Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

Near Knoxville, Tennessee, early on the morning of November 6th, 12-year-old Everett Clark said two men and some women, apparently dressed, "like German soldiers in war movies," emerged from a grounded cigar-shaped object and tried to get back in with his dog. This imprint in the grassy field where the object had rested was found by Knoxville reporters. The boy maintained that what he discovered was as new to him as it was to the reporters.

Curiously enough, the Tennessee report from the schoolboy Everett Clark (page 4) resembles Schmidt's story in several important respects, but as far as we know, the Clark report proved no official investigation at all. We have asked our Knoxville member, James LeaClair, to find out more about this case if possible.

The image does not contain a photograph. However, it does contain an article with the title "New Sputnik Sights Over Elkhart and Gar" and several paragraphs of text describing sightings of an object described as "Sputnik" over the areas of Elkhart and Gar.

Transcribing the text:

NEW SPUTNIK SIGHTS OVER ELKHART AND GAR

Indiana residents reported they saw what appeared to be Sputnik as it hurried across the sky. According to newspaper and radio reports, many residents reported receiving calls from neighbors describing the object as a point of light moving in the north.

Almost all the callers said they saw it at 6:44 a.m. today as they were going home from their night shift, according to Alex Jarrell, Michigan City. He reported he saw the object traverse the sky in a southwestern direction.

The director of Radio Station WKAM said he spotted it at 6:47 a.m. while going home from his night shift. He described it as slightly less bright than a first magnitude star.

In brilliance, he said, it appeared to be about the same as the dog star, Sirius. Parts of Gary reported seeing the object in the early morning.

At Crack Codes Bed of Sputni

ALAMOGORDO, N.M., Nov. 6 - An Alamogordo resident has been going around the community center here describing sights of what he believes to be Sputnik. The object has been analyzed by the engineering staff at White Sands Proving Ground and they report it as being an unidentified flying object.

- page 51 -

The image contains a photograph of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union. The text describes eyewitness accounts of people in Indiana who reported seeing a bright object in the sky, which they believed to be Sputnik. The article discusses the characteristics of the observed object, such as its speed and brightness, as well as the responses from officials and experts.

As an OCR system, the text extracted from the document is as follows:

Sputnik Sighted 
Elkhart and Gary
Looks Like Dog Star, 
Says Boy Watcher
Indians residents around Elkhart reported they saw what appeared to be Sputnik tonight as it hurried across the sky, the Elkhart newspaper and Elkhart radio station reported calls from many residents of the area.
Generally the object was described as slightly less bright than the North Star, was traveling from south to north and was west of Elkhart.
Almost all the callers said they saw the object at about 5:45 a.m.
Gary Hall, 15, of Gary arose to watch the passage of the object. He said he spotted the object, moving south to north, and it was in sight for several minutes.
Hall said he reported the object, thinking it was a beachball, he added.
The object is described as a round, white, glowing mass about the size of a beachball, observers said. Status is described as "hovering and moving".
WKAM, said he spotted it at 5:49 a.m. "It was moving in a slightly northward direction about halfway up in the sky," he said. "It looked like a bright star except that it was moving."
He added that to his way of thinking, the object was of about the size of an average star in the sky.
Bond said Sputnik II was "real enough" and is scheduled to enter the atmosphere today and disintegrate.

AF Cracks
Code Beeps
of Sputnik II
Moscow, Nov. 6 (AP) - An Air Force team has closed a special scientific team at the Air Force missile test center at Patrick Air Force Base, succeeding in "breaking" the codes of signals from the second Soviet satellite, Sputnik II.
The officer said the beep signals now are being monitored and recorded by the center's Electronic Intelligence Team.
The officer said a later announcement will be made on what the code beeps reveal about the satellite and its performance.

MOON TO PASS
OVER CHICAGO
THIS MORNING
Expected at 5:47 for 
a 4 Minutes Visit
Sputnik II, Russia's half-ton satellite, is expected to pass over Chicago almost direcily overhead at 5:47 a.m. this morning, according to Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, chairman of the Argonne National Laboratory. He said that the satellite will be visible for about 4 minutes at that time if skies are not overcast.
In preparations for the anticipated appearance here, the Argonne Laboratory will have a team of astronomers and physicists with telescopes and cameras set up in the laboratory's reservation area. The sky will be kept under observation with telescopes and cameras starting at 5:30 a.m.
The moon will also be passing over Chicago at about the same time, as it moves directly from the south.
The moon passed over Chicago yesterday at 6:05 p.m. and was visible for about 6 minutes.

21 November 1957 
Albuquerque, New Mexico 
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object 
1. On 6 November 1957, at approximately 1845 hours, a yellowish-white light was observed by two officers of the Albuquerque Police Department, while on routine patrol. The light was first sighted in the southwest sky, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. 
2. The object was first observed as a motionless light; however, within a few seconds, it began moving in a northeasterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. The object then made an abrupt 90-degree turn to the east and continued at a high rate of speed, finally disappearing from view in the eastern sky. 
3. The entire observation lasted approximately 30-40 seconds. The object was observed to be approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length, and no sound was heard during the observation. 
4. Weather conditions at the time were clear, with a few scattered clouds. Visibility was unrestricted. 
5. This office has made a thorough investigation of the incident and is unable to offer a positive identification of the object observed. It is requested that this case be forwarded to Project Blue Book for further evaluation.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a full-page article titled "Venus Most Prominent" by James Stokley. The article discusses Venus as the only planet visible in the evening sky and how it will soon be joined by other planets. The article also includes a star chart showing the locations of various constellations and stars in relation to the appearance of Venus.

Text extracted from the document:

VENUS MOST PROMINENT

Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY

That brilliant object you see in the west after sunset these evenings is not a star, but the planet Venus. It is the "evening star" now, but Venus will not remain in this position for long. As the other planets gradually come into view, Venus will lose some of its prominence in the sky.

Venus is far brighter than any other star visible in the night sky and there can be no doubt as to its identity. Long before the sky is dark, this brilliant planet can be observed. It is one of the earliest celestial objects to come into view as the sun sets.

Venus has gradually been drawing to the east, after reaching its greatest brilliance early in the month. It will pass by the relatively faint star Antares, in the constellation Scorpius, on the evening of Nov. 17. After this time, Venus will begin to draw gradually away from the western horizon, and remain visible for a shorter time each evening.

Orion Season's Finest

This is the Orient season's finest, for in the east rises the great constellation Orion, the hunter. It is one of the most prominent stellar groups in the entire heavens, and is just beginning now to make its evening debut.

The three stars in a row that form the "Belt of Orion" are a conspicuous feature, while slightly above them is the reddish star Betelgeuse, marking one of Orion's shoulders. Below the belt are the stars that form the "Sword of Orion" which appears to be hanging from the belt. A keen eye can make out the nebulosity in this part of the sword, showing the great glowing cloud of gas which contains new stars in the process of formation.

Bright Birds in the Sky

These autumn evenings, however, show the stars at their best. High overhead is the giant Summer Triangle, formed by the bright stars Vega, Altair and Deneb. This is a real part of the northern constellations of Lyra, Aquila and Cygnus. To the east, the brilliant white star Capella is rising, marking the head of the goat-herder Auriga.

The star Arcturus, the brightest in the northern sky, has swung to the west, while the brilliant Vega is near the zenith. Procyon, the "little dog star," is coming into view in the northeast, its modest scintillations contrasting with the sparkling of the overhead giants. This is the time of year when the great star patterns are most impressive in the heavens.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing text only.

The text output is as follows:

No Case (Information Only)
6 November 1957
Boston, Massachusetts

3) November 6, 1925, about 5:30 a.m.: A lens-shaped disk came out of the sky on edge, leveled off to a horizontal position, hung motionless over Boston for a minute or two, then "stood on edge" again and went off into the sky. It was amazed at the size of this thing, says the witness who reported this to Mr. J. Boston (and who has always been considered a reliable observer). Compared with the Boston skyscrapers, it was as large as a ten-story building.

Lawrence J. Tacker. Major, USAF
Subject: Disposition Division
Office of Information Services
Departments of the Air Force

March 29, 1958

Dear Sir:

A copy of this unclassified letter will be sent to the publishers for nationwide distribution. The enclosed information should be included for public relations.

1. That the Air Force has an unusual disregard for the facts and a strange unattractiveness to the truth.
2. That the Air Force refuses to abide by its own written objectives.

All of my UFO sighting experiences have led me to conclude that the Air Force has no answers concerning the UFO phenomenon and has failed, either willfully or through inability, to make an objective study of the subject. The last nine months of my active duty with the Air Force have been a nightmare of strictures, prevention orders, and defeats of my efforts to state the facts truthfully. The Air Force makes a very definite obligation to identify and publicly explain all UFO sightings, yet in this case they refuse to do so.

Sincerely,
Lawrence J. Tacker
Major General, USAF

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report from Project Blue Book, dated March 26, 1958, discussing an unidentified object sighting.

Lawrence J. Tacker
Page 3
March 26, 1958

Mr. *** said he was coming from Painesville towards his home when he sighted this object. He said it seemed to be large, about the size of two large aircraft, and it was descending from the northwest. He said it slowed suddenly and then accelerated again. When he first saw it, it was a dull silver color and seemed to be glowing from the inside. As it slowed down, it took a bluish-green color much like that of a luminous welding torch. The object appeared to be flat on the top and bottom and almost round in shape. It made no noise whatsoever and gave off light waves which caused static on his car radio.

As he approached the object, it again accelerated, and he said he could not estimate the speed, but it was very fast. The color changed to a reddish-orange as it gained speed. He said it appeared to be about twenty to thirty feet above the ground.

Mr. *** was then asked about vision into the object or sighting any people or structure. The answer was negative, the object appeared solid and gave off varying colors of light as described.

Mr. *** was then asked why he was absent for a whole day and night after this incident.

He explained of his fears of the sighting, and the general attitude of his friends was one of disbelief and amusement, etc. He said there had been some light on the subject for the investigators, but that was all he knew and said.

The report goes on to provide additional details about the sighting, including the witness's physical symptoms and radiation measurements. However, it does not contain any photographs.

CIVIL Defense meeting to interview Lt.
Mr. R. and Mr. B. arrived in Chedron, 3, 30 P.M. and were met by Col. H. L. O. Berriges and Lt D. C. of the Air Rescue Service at which time the personnel of Station H B B - T V of Columbia, Ohio, were interviewed.
They interviewed Mr. S. The Sheriff and Mr. L. the under Sheriff.
The object was sighted at 6:30 p.m. May 7, 1957. Received by Cpl. J. Shahn, Sherry Hill, Texas, phone and address unknown, Lt. D. C. O arrived in Chedron, 3, on the evening of May 7, 1957.
The object was round in shape, and was observed for about 45 minutes, It appeared to be about 15 feet in diameter at a distance of 5 to 8 miles, and was a bright red or pink color, not quite as bright as a weld- light. It appeared to be an object of some sort hovering above the ground, and when it would disappear it would blink out rather than fade out.
Witness Mr. S. the Sheriff, stated he was coming from Tularosa toward his home when he sighted the object. The other landing did a steady fast move upward and then Blinked out. When it reap peared, it was a steady pink or red color and appeared to be about 15-20 feet in diameter, and hovered from 5 to 8 miles away. He should have a witness to what he saw. He returned to his car and drove to the scene with Mr. L. the under sheriff.
Upon arriving at the scene they found the object was gone. They returned to the scene later and found it again, hovering about the same place.
Mr. S. was then asked as to the color, and shape and nature of this object. He stated, that the color was a bluish-green color, much like the same color as a welder's torch. Its shape was round and it appeared to hover above the ground about 15-20 feet in diameter. There was no noise nor did it appear to have any means of propulsion. It gave off a phosphorescent glow, or a measure electrically in the home.

TEXT OUTPUT:

The subject, his identity to this investigation, is now reporting that Bernold McGuire, approximately age 24, with the crown hair and bald appearance, 180 lbs, 6'2" tall, who seemed to be in charge of the object or sighting, wanted to talk to the crown or sheriff about what he had seen. The subject stated he knew of other people with the object or sighting, and wanted to talk to the authorities but seemed afraid to do so at the time. He was then asked about vision into the object or seeing any people, and he stated he did not see any people go into or come from the object, and did not see any people with it. The sighting was about for a whole day and night, after he first observed it. 

Mr. McGuire was then asked about his vision into the object or seeing any people, and he stated he did not see any people go into or come from the object, and did not see any people with it. The sighting was about for a whole day and night, after he first observed it.

INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:
The subject impressed the investigator as being completely sincere and telling the absolute truth about the incident. He gave the impression of a man who had seen something which astounded and amazed him to the extent that he seemed reticent about it and telling about it. He stated that when he first observed the object, he thought it was a weather balloon, but as time went on and he continued to observe it, he realized it was not a weather balloon. He said it was round and saucer-shaped, larger than any weather balloon, and completely silent in its flight, and hovered at times. He was about 1 1/2 miles from the object when he first saw it, and it was about 500 feet in the air. 

He said, when he was interviewed, that was all he knew and saw.

"'Thing' Over Geauge
Makes Geiger Click
"'Thinkink" that might have seen or heard of things, see below that when any radio-active material comes near the Geiger counter, the click will increase, as this shows the radioactivity or atomic disintegration in the material. 
So when the "Thing" passed over the Geiger counter, it set off a clicking, which means the "Thing" contained some radioactive material.
The "Thing" was about 6 feet in diameter and seemed to be cigar-shaped. It made no noise and left no trail, but they find that it set off the Geiger counter near by. This is hard to explain, but that is what happened.

'Thing' Makes Geiger Field Radioactive
Car Parked TV

Sheriff spotte about a strange peak Antenna
Just as I turned on my
TV this evening, the picture faded out. Just then the Sheriff called me over the phone and said some strange object had been sighted in the sky and had knocked out TV reception for miles around.
It had been followed by several people who reported that when it passed over a parked car, the Geiger counter in the car showed a sharp rise in radioactivity.
The object was described as about 30 feet in diameter, round, and metallic in appearance. It made no sound and left no trail, but did seem to affect nearby electrical and electronic equipment.
The reports indicate that the object may have contained a radioactive material of some kind.
This is just another incident of the many strange objects that have been sighted in our skies in recent years."

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, containing text detailing a report about an incident on the Vista del Mar beach in California on November 6th, 1957.

The text in the document is as follows:

"SPACEMEN ON THE VISTA DEL MAR, CALIFORNIA, BEACH?

On November 6th, the Los Angeles Mirror-News printed an account of an incident said to have occurred along the beach at Vista del Mar, California. According to the report, one man who was driving to work at Santa Monica when his car broke down, had been similarly afflicted. This individual is said to have identified as being from Redondo Beach and as having seen an object "in a blue haze on the beach."

He described it "as a gold metal, can-shaped object in color, with two metal rings around it." He said this object was about 20 yards from him and that he saw two figures, dressed in green coveralls, standing beside it. According to the report, the witness said "They wanted to know where we were going, who we were, what time it was, and questions like that." He said, "Their skin seemed to be sort of yellowish-green in the early light, but they looked like earth-people to me. I thought they invited me to go close, but I couldn't understand too well and said I had to go to work."

Later the witness said that he had never seen "flying saucers" before "or anything like that."

Two days later Mr. Mirror-News columnist commented as follows: "It goes to show that, try as we may, some of these claims of 'close encounters' are bound to crop up. And may I say that I wish they'd come forward. Because, gentlemen, while I hate to admit it, I'm all shook up over the thing myself."

Meanwhile, West Coast OSI member Idabel Eppereon was busy checking, "because of the similarity of the name," the possibility of finding the witness. However, the OSI found only three little experiences behind the scenes in politics and have no illusions left as to why and means of discrediting people. I was delighted to hear from one "near-casualty" individual who was quoted and his comment was, "I will remain anonymous in this case, even if it means some sort of reprisals, because I shall not give the public who have not yet heard of me a chance to either applaud or condemn me. The same feeling, the same can scarcely see where this would be made notorious overnight to many people. You can scarcely see where this would be made notorious overnight to many people."

Mrs. Epperson attempted to locate the alleged two other witnesses. Checking "Redondo" and three first names, she began calling the numbers but simply asked for "Mr. ____." She was unsuccessful in Torrance. She began calling the names and simply asked for "Mrs. ____." None of the three said they had called and asked for her.

None of the Mrs. Epperson called were the witness she was looking for, but all three said they had received similar calls."

AFCIN-4E2 Weekly Activity Report

SUBJECT: UFO Program  11 March 1959

1. On 10 November 1958, Major Robert F. Friend and Major Vesco OLLER, D.D. of the Aerial Phenomena Group, AFCIN-4E2, made a trip to the Montville, Ohio area for the purpose of investigating an Unidentified Flying Object sighting reported to the Sheriff's office by Mr. R., who lives near Montville. This case is an old case of 6 November 1957, but has caused the Air Force much in the way of enquiries, and to some extent endangered its prestige, due to exploitation by private UFO investigators.

2. The Air Technical Intelligence Center had no report from an Air Force source on Mr. R., himself; therefore, all of the information was obtained from Mr. R. firsthand and as such reliability considered reasonable.

3. The investigation was successful. Mr. R. was very cooperative and it was learned that many of the statements attributed to him were very inaccurate. One such statement as that he had turned this information over to the Defense Department and interrogated for two days, then warned not to mention where he had been or why. This investigation was carried on to the Air Technical Intelligence Center's conclusion that the UFO was probably a "fireball".

MEMO FOR RECORD -
SUBJECT: Object Sighting, 6 November 1957

1. a. On 6 November 1957, Mr. - of Monroeville, Ohio, reported that he and his wife had observed an unidentified flying object while driving northeast on U.S. Highway from Painesville to Monroeville. This object was hovering over the highway and then disappeared. This case was investigated by the Civilian Defense and the Air Force and according to the report appearing in the Civil Defense Report, it appears to have been a reliable sighting.

2. Facts for Consideration.
On 29 November 1955, Major Friend and M/Sgt Hill visited Mansfield, Ohio to contact Mr. - concerning a February sighting by him and an object described by Mr. Moore. I find it necessary when conducting investigations of such phenomena to explain that I am not connected with the Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI) and this material is sent solely for your information and retention. The contents are not to be reproduced in any manner without prior approval. I would appreciate your recording this information and returning the "blank tape" and return postage.

recording of his interview with Mr. C. in summary: the tape recording is essentially the same information in this CIVIL DEFENSE Report. (This document)

On 10 March 1959, Major Friend and M/Sgt Hill of the Aerial Phenomena Group, USAF-Dayton visited Chanco, Taylorsville and Montville, Ohio in connection with the incident at Galion, Ohio. The Sheriff was very cooperative and revealed all the information in his files concerning this incident. The Sheriff stated that he heard about the case the morning after the sighting, when Mr. C. came into his office. The Sheriff's information was obtained from Mr. C. The Sheriff's report contained a drawing of the object made by Mr. C., a copy of which is attached.

In Taylorsville, Ohio, a contact was made with Mr. L. H., a principal witness. Mr. L. H. pointed out that he was one of the three persons that took readings on the object. The other two were Mr. C. and his son. Mr. L. H. stated that they were also able to see some markings on the object, which were very deep, in a diameter of approximately 4 inches. Plaster casts or these marks were made by Case Institute in Cleveland, Ohio. Samples of this object were also taken to be given for specific radiation level readings. However, no specific readings given.

The object was reported to have fallen. Mr. L. H. stated that it was a quiet relative, low-flying object and that he said that he was near his house and should have some witnesses. But there rather deep imprint which remained about 12 inches and backs were concerned with the investigation were those of rabbits, muskrats, birds and dogs. Radiation level measurements were taken, but follow the normal background.

The final visit was made to Mr. C. to obtain first hand information concerning his sighting. He had moved and was located only by intensive leg work. Finally he being traced through the following is the interview as closely as can be remembered.

Major Friend - Mr. Intelligence Officer, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base.
Mr. - (Looks at credentials and smiles) Uh huh.
Major Friend - Generally describe what you saw Mr. and then I will ask some specific questions.
Mr. - I was coming home from Paynesviile, Ohio on Route #35. I saw this thing through the windshield of the car. It was traveling higher than normal highway traffic and was also traveling much faster than the normal highway traffic. There didn't seem to be any sound associated with the object as it passed over the car. There was a whirring sound like something to do with the headlights that I noticed. Then I changed my mind and drove home to get my wife. On my return there was no evidence of the object.
Major Friend - Was there only one object?
Mr. - It appeared to become two just as it went over the car.
Major Friend - What was the direction in which your car was headed?
Mr. - South - southeast.
Major Friend - Can you be sure there was an absence of sound or was it possible you couldn't hear it with the car going?
Mr. - I can't be sure.
Major Friend - How long was the object in sight?
Mr. - Approximately three (3) seconds.
Major Friend - How fast were you driving?
Mr. - Fifty miles per hour.
Major Friend - Did you apply brakes as soon as you saw the object?
Mr. - Yes.
Major Friend - Was the object in sight until the car came to a complete stop?

Text extracted from the document:

No, only after it appeared to be on the ground.
When you first saw the object which half of the wind-shield did it appear to be in the upper or the lower?
The lower.
You have already stated it disappeared over the car which means it moved to the upper or lower half of your windshield?
Yes.
Did the object hover or stop at any time?
Only when it was on the ground.
Did you see it take off after it was on the ground?
No.
You have mentioned everything except size and shape. Can you give us any information on that?
Yes, the object was very small and then became much larger, and it was generally round.
Have any other government officials contacted you?
Yes, I think an Air Force man, but after seeing you, I don't know.
What was his name, rank and organization?
His name was Captain blank, and he was from Youngstown, Ohio.
I understand Mr. - - that you were taken to the Department of Defense for questioning. Is this true?
No. (Smiling)
Have you been contacted by any other people regarding your experience?
Yes, quite a number of crackpots call and come to see me. (Mrs. - - - - calls in with "These guys have dedicated their lives to these things! A Mr. - - - - has been recording this.")
Mr. - - - - what do you think you saw?
I don't know, but I wish someone would tell me. (Mrs. - - - - There must be some logical explanation.)

Major Friend - Mr. __, I think you saw an exceptional meteor called a "fireball" which is as bright or brighter than -3 magnitude, that means approximately 15 times as bright as the North Star, and considerable larger in size. Fireballs are very rare and usually a person experiences only 1 or 2 in a lifetime if they observe the sky regularly. Under certain circumstances if it comes close enough, it can be a very frightening experience and may sound like a thundering or whistling sound.Some people have reported these meteors to have struck the ground and the same objects has been seen two or three hundred miles away.

Mr. __ - I certainly am glad you explained to me what I saw.

Major Friend - Mr. __, I further think that because of the startling effect of 'glow' you also suffered some visual illusions in connection with it. Rather than the object moving slowly, the bright glow probably made it appear to move very rapidly. Also the increase in size of the object and its apparent increase in size is sometimes characteristic of objects moving many times faster than the speed of sound.

3. Discussion and Analysis:
a. Mr. __ is married, has five children and is a man of less than average means. (He was on several television programs and had some articles written) about the subject. It is our opinion that he was quite sincere and told the truth.
b. It is our opinion that the civil defense people of this area are quite unorganized in their policy or due to the fact that Mr. __ was quite a UFO fan.
c. Other witnesses saw an object with the same description as Mr. __'s opinion that the late hour and low population density are the factors responsible for such few witnesses or this particular sighting.
d. It seems quite logical that the meteor seen by Mr. __ was quite near burn out. It probably burned out or exploded and some extremely small pieces hit the earth soon after is passed over Mr. __.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 6 November 1957 Everlitstown, New Jersey.

FROG-EYED - DOG EYED

Among the many remarkable reports dated November 6, 1957, the following almost escaped attention. A physician found told about the German baron who lives in Washington, D.C., and has actively participated in investigating the Hanger 18, called to the witness'attention the incident which took place at Everlitstown, New Jersey.

About dusk on November 6 John Trasco had just returned to his home in Everlitstown, King, the 6-year-old, charcoal-colored, half-blind, bad-tempered Belgian police dog, ran yelling up to the side of the house. Mrs. Trasco, at the kitchen window, heard King barking furiously, and looked out to see a bright light in front of the barn, which at first she thought was a pond or puddle of water (reflecting the last light of the sky). Mrs. Trasco turned on the porch light and looking more closely, saw a luminous shape which she could not identify. Suddenly, this object moved off rapidly, rising straight up and out of sight. Mrs. Trasco hurried out in front of the barn, but the object had already disappeared.

Because of the shrubbery, she did not see the little man that her husband confronted. The little man was 3 feet 4 inches tall, and Mrstrasco described himasseeming to be wearing a graycoverall-type garment with a glove on each elbow. "He had a putty-colored face, a nose and chin, and large protruding eyes." He had a rotlle-like voice. "In a joking and nasty" he spoke to Mr. Trasco: "I'm broken language, as if he came from the other side." What Mr. Trasco thought he said was, "You don't want to know your wife and want your dog." Trasco said he heard his wife, frightened but angry, yell, "Get the hell out of here!" At this the creature 50-answered "She can't - I'm still understanding, since Mrs. Trasco said her husband had seen no door, hole less, or other opening. (He also reposted that it could not have risen so rapidly into the sky, like a jet, due to its small size.)

Trasco off, en shooting straight upand outof sight. Mrs. King, by this time, was standing beside Mr. Trasco, evidently terrified. Happetor asked Mrs. Trasco (when we talked to her): "Did you have to have spoken only to Mrs. Trasco. we should have checked, since there was no other specific statement indicating more than one creature.) and the god, said one kind of the person on the ground, but it remained puzzled. The houses and road opposite the Trascos, and the houses on either side of them were unoccupied.

The couple told no one of their experience, because "we knew no one would believe it." Except, though, when the strange problem returned again exactly a year before, but the Trascos' had not been observed by her report on Hanger. says Mrs. Trasco, "If it happens again I'll probably go away from the place." To Mrs. Trasco added, "But I told John, we should have let them take King. He so half blind and do cross we don't know who else would ever want him." Says King: "Dick never bark like that for a stranger - in fact, I think of him as sort of my child." When the invisible thing passed over the house, Mrs. Trasco says, "They didn't move, as the lights of an airplane do." Plants do."

The image does not contain any photograph, only text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

It is our opinion the residue from this meteor could account for the increase in the radiation level and that a small proportion could account for Mr._______ other illusions.

Major friend pointed out to Mr._______ that public anxieties over radiation could be curtailed by also supplying the newspapers with information as to what constitutes normal radiation. The newspapers wanted only information which would make sales.

CONCLUSION: Mr._______ and the other witnesses probably saw a meteor or exceptional brightness and size - a fireball. A fireball is defined as a meteor as bright or brighter than -4 magnitude. These meteors may have varied brightness and may change color during flight. Fireballs may appear at random and usually disappear without exploding. Some meteors leave trails which may also be variecolored and may change color after being observed. A fireball may leave a cloud of smoke which expand uniformly or in a certain direction.

On the night of November 6, 1957, at about 11:20 p.m., a citizen residing near the Albuquerque, New Mexico, International Airport observed a bright light moving across the sky. This light appeared to be round in shape and seemed to be emitting a reddish glow. The object was estimated to be about thirty miles east of Albuquerque. This incident occurred on November 6, 1957. When the object was first observed it was moving at a very high rate of speed. It then descended rapidly and hovered over the airport area for a few seconds. The object then moved rapidly to the northeast and was lost from sight. The witness stated this was definitely not an aircraft or helicopter, and that he had observed airplanes and satellites on many occasions. The witness was a well-known and respected member of the local community. The object was observed by a Sergeant stationed at the 1608th Air Police Squadron at the Kirtland Air Force Base. Radar tracking indicated the presence of a target in the vicinity of the Albuquerque International Airport, at the time the object was observed visually. No explanation has been determined for this sighting and it is considered a valid unidentified flying object incident.
