The Associated Press
LAS VEGAS - A fire department official at La Madera, N.M., said he "saw about 25 circular objects resembling flying saucers in the sky Sunday night.
Curt Suthers, chief of the La Madera volunteer fire department, said the objects were "maneuvering at a tremendous speed" in the sky over La Madera, about 40 miles north of here.
Suthers said the objects were first spotted about 7:30 p.m. and were visible for about 15 minutes. He said they appeared to be about a mile high and estimated their speed at 600-700 miles per hour.
The report came in a dispatch from the United Press International bureau in Albuquerque.
All the reports said the objects were first spotted in the sky and one was then "observed to land" near La Madera.
The dispatcher said the reports came from the La Madera fire department but there were no details on whether an actual landing had been observed.
In a later telephone interview, Suthers said the objects he saw were a "rather violent orange-red in color" and varied in size from 30-50 feet in diameter.
The reports said the objects made a high-pitched whining sound and appeared to be hovering at times.
The dispatcher said all local law enforcement agencies had been notified.

SOCORRO, N.M. - Dr. J. A. Hynek, Scientific Consultant to Project Blue Book, visited LaMadera, N.M. on April 25, 1964, to investigate a reported UFO sighting.

Mr. Lonnie Zamora, a Socorro policeman, reported that on April 24, 1964, about 5:45 p.m., he was driving south on N.M. Highway 1, just south of the city limits of Socorro, when he saw a shiny object in the sky to the southwest. He first thought it was an overturned car, and when he slowed down to investigate, he saw what appeared to be a car on the ground with two people near it. As he got closer, about 150-200 yards, he saw the object rise off the ground with a tremendous roar and great flame, and disappear over the horizon. The object was described as being about the size of a car, oval in shape, and white in color. Mr. Zamora said the object was very shiny, and made a sound like a roar, not a blast. The object had a red insignia on the side. During the investigation, Dr. Hynek was able to corroborate many of the details in Mr. Zamora's report. Mr. Zamora is described as a reliable and stable person, and his report is considered credible.

La Madera, New Mexico  
26 April, 1964

ZAMORA-LIKE OBJECT SEEN

La Madera, New Mexico, April 26 - Orlanda Gallegos, 35, of Santa Fe, reportedly was a witness to an elliptical object similar in description to the one observed by Patrolman Zamora in his father's home north of Soccoro, New Mexico. While occupied in the activity of chasing stray horses, he noted an unusual craft resting upon the ground in a pasture. Some 200 feet distant. The object was described as being about the length of this telephone pole, with a circumference of 14 feet. Ringing of a blue flame emitted from jets about its underside. An attempting to persuade his family not to mention the incident, he was particularly unsuccessful, for they were too frightened by it. The next morning, however, they all examined the landing area, nothing particular to be noticed by them from the previous night. State Police Captain Martin Virgin, upon checking the charred area, noticing that the rocks present within the charred landing site 'crushed. Green Brush in the surrounding area had been set afire, evidently from intense heat. Four deep impressions and unusual 'pass-prints' resembling those of a flourish Lian, were also seen.

The Air Force, although having sent investigators into the area, has thus far remained silent on their findings, if any.

Here is the text output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the document:

made of a shiny metallic substance, had no windows, and was as long as a telephone pole and about 14 feet in circumference. It was egg-shaped and resembled a large butane tank.

The next morning, feeling braver in the daylight, the family went out to take a look. The UFO was gone, though the ground was still smoldering! Local police were notified, and found a large charred area, strange marks in the ground resembling tiny prints, and depressions similar to those found at Jocorro. As a matter of fact, it is reliably reported that the ground was still smoldering twenty hours after the sighting! The charred area, seen by police, Air Force officials, and many other people, was about 20 feet in diameter. Large rocks within the area showed evidence of extreme heat, while others a few feet away were not damaged at all. Even pieces of glass and metal were found melted and fused. A police officer ventured the opinion that no fuel presently known to mankind would leave the sort of traces found at La Madera. He also felt that the evidence indicated an extreme heat of short duration. We do not yet know what conclusions, if any, were formulated by the Air Force.

THE SECOND NEW MEXICO LANDING: Another sensational saucer landing occurred near the town of La Madera, New Mexico, within hours of the Socorro incident. A. le about 12:30 a.m., Orlando Gallegos, who was visiting his father's home there, went outside to chase away some horses. It was then that he saw a strange craft of some sort sitting on the ground in a gravel area. He was about 200 feet from it, and was afraid to get any closer. When Gallegos first sighted the UFO, there was a ring of blue flame erupting from numerous jets around the bottom of the craft. He heard no noise, and as he watched, the flames were turned off. Gallegos did not see anyone or anything moving around outside the UFO.
He returned to his father's house and told the family about the incident, but apparently they were all too frightened to go outside to take a look. Gallegos' wife later described him as looking "badly shaken." He returned twice more, alone, to gaze in amazement at the object. He said that it was

SANTA FE (U.P.) - Two members of the San Juan Coun-ty sheriff's department reported seeing a flying object over the San Juan mountains near La Madera, N.M. recently.
The sighting was made about 7:30 p.m. near the foot of La Madera mountain, according to Deputy Sheriff Orlando Gallegos, who reported the incident to the State Police.
Gallegos and Deputy Sheriff Cenobio Gallegos said they saw the object give off a bright light and then disappear.
The two officers said they had been patrolling the area near a school when they saw the object in the sky. They said there were no flashing lights or other distinguishable features on the object and that it simply gave off a bright light and then vanished from sight.
The matter was reported to the State Police, to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and to the Federal Aviation Agency. No other reports on the incident have been received so far.

Continued from page 22
As indicated in the previous report, this case was investigated by Lt. Fitz of the 1st Air Force, and the following additional information was obtained.

The object was reported to have been observed from about 1200 to 1230 hours on 8 April 1964 by several persons in the La Madera, New Mexico area. It was described as a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object which hovered over the area for about 30 minutes.

Several witnesses reported that the object appeared to descend to within a few hundred feet of the ground and then rapidly ascended and disappeared from view. No sounds were heard from the object.

The investigation revealed that there were no aircraft or other known objects in the area at the time of the sightings. The case is considered to be unexplained.
