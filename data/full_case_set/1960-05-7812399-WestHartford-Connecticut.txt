The text in the document is as follows:

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: West Hartford, Connecticut
Date: 16 May 1960  Hour: (2) 0400002 0600002
WX: Clear, vis 15 & 12 mi, winds S @ 1-7 Knots W @ 8-25 knots

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Pass Acft
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Prob unreliable 
Analysis and Conclusions: The witness is located in an area crisscrossed by many airways, and there are many aircraft,both military and civilian, flying over the area at all times. Although there were no craft from the local civil and military airfields reported in this area at that time, there was one aircraft in the distance from one of the numerous fields in the vicinity. Findings indicate that this was most likely an aircraft which appeared unusual due to various factors such as viewing angle, lighting conditions, and atmospheric effects.
