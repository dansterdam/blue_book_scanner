LUMINOUS OBJECTS SEEN OVER ALGERIA -- Oran, Oran Republic, 16 Aug 52

In Ain Sefra, on the night of 12 August 1952, a railroad agent observed a ball of fire which was descending at an angle from E to W and leaving behind a luminous pink trail.  The object, appearing in volume, the object stopped suddenly, became bright red, and seemed to explode, but the observer did not hear any noise.

At 2115 hours on 14 August 1952, two persons in the city of Constantine saw a luminous object flying at high speed toward the North.  According to the local weather bureau, the local weather balloons had not launched any weather balloons.

The same day, at 1920 hours, many people at the docks of Philippeville saw in the sky an enormous red disk going from N to W, leaving behind a greenish trail.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image on this page of the Project Blue Book document. The text appears to be a detailed written report describing an unidentified aerial object sighting, providing descriptions and witness accounts. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text contained in the document:

Memorandum for Record

Subject: Investigation of Unidentified aerial object reported by Lt. 2nd Lt. B. J. Ruppelt and 2/Lt. Olsson of Project "Blue Book", ATIC, Dayton, Ohio.

1. On 21 Aug 52 at about 2330 EST, Capt. E. J. Ruppelt and 2/Lt Olsson of "Project Blue Book", ATIC, Dayton, Ohio, reported seeing an unidentified object in the sky near the airport, Florida. At approximately 1930 EST they reported the object in the west in the vicinity of Fort Myers, Florida. Capt. Ruppelt and 2/Lt Olsson were in an L-13 Patterson 25B but due to mechanical trouble with the aircraft, they stayed and participated in the investigation.

2. Upon landing the ARDC group spoke to the witnesses, who were two U.S. Air Force officers. It was stated that people had seen flares in the vicinity of the sighting area at some unknown time and said that it was generally believed that the unknown object was possibly seen by a person. At the time of the talk with Capt. Zeho no details as to what he was referring to were obtained as it was assumed that they were referring to some condition as it is normally known by the Tactical Inspection Team. (No further details on this are known at present, and they could not be located. More details have been requested from him).

3. On the morning of 22 Aug 52 Capt. Carney, the Intelligence Officer of the 1707th Air Base Wing, Eglin Beach Airport, Florida, was interviewed. He stated that on the evening of 21 Aug 52 the tower personnel at Eglin Beach Airport reported seeing an unidentified object in the sky from the searchlights, three skyseaters, and other possible witnesses to the incident. These statements are being forwarded through channels per Air Force letter 200-5. The contents of the statements are the same as details obtained orally. Details will be given in this memo, consequently the contents of the signed statements will not be discussed.

4. Captain Ruppelt and 2/Lt Olsson, who had examined the area visually, stated that on the evening of 21 Aug 52 they were contacted. He made a complete report of this incident, which was normal physically. The hair on the back of his neck of his persons was singed, but not burned. The skin on his forearms showed marks of blistering, later described as milkerny (burning light), and there was absolutely no after-effects (Comment: this examination took place 15 hours after the incident). It was noted that his hair in his nostrils had also been singed but that he had cut it off. There was no apparent ill-feeling of this incident, the enlisted man under his command at the time stated that he had some doubt as to several points in the story.

5. It is stated that he had received a "Other Than Honorable" discharge from the Marines in 1944. He had been hitch-hiking and was picked up by an unknown person. The person got hired of driving and asked the person Ruppelt which he did. They were picked up by law enforcement officers and it was learned that the car was stolen. He was charged with auto theft, but the charges were later dropped. He said that because of this incident he was discharged from the Marines. (His Marine records have been requested).

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

It is stated that in 1948 he had had an accident in which an automobile mobile slipper of some sort fell on his stomach. The results of this accident were hospitalization for 3 months.

When asked if he had ever had photographs, he stated a flat "no", looking to the best of his recollection, he had never had a photograph taken by anyone and was still looking, as it was impossible for him to have had a photograph taken.

He said that some time ago, on 17 Aug 52, Capt. Davis and Lt Olsson of ATIC, Capt Carley and an airman from the 1707th Air Base Wing Intelligence, who conducted an interview with the witness, who said he had no other staff-car driver visited the scene of the incident. (See attached map and photographs).

The deputies gave their account of the incident: At about 2200 CST on the night of 19 Aug 52, they were called and told that the Heydonns were at a house asking for help. They proceeded to separate cars to the house (3 persons in witness' car) at approximately 2:30 they met them coming through the Palmer Station area in their cars. They stated the light was a little smaller than a basketball and was low - about a foot off the ground. As it approached they watched as it gradually dimmed. After it had passed, they said they saw no possible means of propulsion, and it finally came out and explained the incident to the officers. They made one definitive conclusion: in all their experience they had never seen a person as frightened as this witness at that time.

The witness said he saw a light that was an oval, slightly larger than a basketball, and about 3 feet off the ground. It was silent, and a yellowish-white in color, and hovered for about 10 seconds. He said it then went straight up and disappeared rapidly. The report describes that the witnesses claimed this was a place where a person had been lying near the light. The spot where the object hovered was examined, and it was found that the grass and foliage had been scorched or trampled down in a circle about 50 yards around.

One boy scout, a boy about 12, was also contacted. In the presence of his parents he stated that he had been riding with detectives and two other boy scouts. As they were passing the spot where the object was seen, a bright light suddenly appeared just ahead of their vehicle. It did not seem to actually enter the vehicle, but rather entered the windshield area and then disappeared.

- page 10 -

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a text-based report.

The full text transcribed from the document is as follows:

"Bay another light. One scout wanted to go on, but we turned around and went back to the spot and stopped. He investigated the sound. He said that the scouts were throwing dirt and if he was not back to call for help. Nothing happened that I could see his light, them went off westward in the wooded area beside the road and saw his light and saw him fall. Then they can up the road to a house that had a light on. 

10. Approximately 1300 on 22 Aug 52 Capt Garry sent a staff car to pick up 11. I started down the road in front of the barn and during a conversation was advised to go to the camp of the Scouts down the road from Capt Garry's office. On the way there was a cooperative, he appeared to be normal, but just as he started to give his statement on the incident (which was cooperative, he seemed to be normal) the following account is taken from notes that were taken by Capt Kappell during the interview and are not near verbatim as possible.

11. "I was going south (long Military Trail) about 40 MPH looking around with 10 kids (Boy Scouts) when I caught sight of a light out of the corner of my eye. I looked around and saw a string of hazy lights like the cabin windows of a house. They seemed to move down toward the driveway 3 250 yards like the woods. Then the kids saw it too. 'Hey, look at that!' More than 1 kids saw it. It appeared to hover with kids then went down over the trees. The incident began about 2230 or 2300 hours, that if it was a secret project that had just come on, it was 9:45. I told the kids to estimate what they saw so far as help and it seemed to last several minutes. I judged the lights were about the size of headlights of an automobile and 3 of them in a formation. They were so hazy that I could not make out any details except the shape which appeared to be oval. I looked at it for 2 or 3 minutes and noticed four objects (about 8 inches in diameter) 2 230 ). Then a noticed an open space ahead of me and that could be a lake. It turned out to be a clearing. I saw no lights on the way in."

12. "Was I said I was surprised at reaching a clearing, thinking it might be a lake and I carefully stopped forward with the lights pointed toward the ground. I had a second two cell flashlight in my backpocket".

13. "When I first stepped into the clearing I noticed a peculiar smell. I went thru the clearing and had the flashlight on throughout the operation. There was a light fog and all I could see were the things on the ground. It was not light and humid like and it seemed to be oozing from above. It seemed to be coming from above. On being questioned on this point he meant that he couldn't see stars. I had my eyes wide open in my eyes. I pointed the flashlight to throw something or hit it with a switch. I fell for flashlight in my backpocket, but it was dead. I laid it aside and kept on with the flashlight from the car. This was the only light that had been on down into the clearing. It was daylight about 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning and I could then see the area clearly. At the bottom of the object was a dull black with no seamsor joints or rivets like. It had dirty streaks running downward possibly caused by the lighting effect of the clearing. When asked if they were circular concentric rings he said 'no'. I went to run but those, but was so excited I was so beside myself. I then got control of myself and backed away. I could feel the pine trees. I then got control of myself and backed away. I could feel the pine trees."

"heat lassen as I backed out from under the edge of the ship. I looked up and saw only the white color of the ship silhouetted against the sky. It was coming towards me with a dosen sharp toy and a glow with a sort of a phosphorescent, flash like appendage or light. The light seemed to get closer and brighter (or seemed to) as I was of them. (Comment: He repeated this frequent during the interview).
My friend and I had her to have seen the object as it appeared to move back as he approached).
As I backed my 1951 Pontiac on the object and could've got my eyes off of it, but as soon as I backed off I could see the object illuminated against the sky. I could see the object, it was about half the size of a large bushel basket opening and thought someone was going to watch me. (Comment: P-2-This could be an observation from inside more taking.)
I don't know how long I was out there possibly I was overcome with fright but couldn't see what it was. Next I have a red flare which appeared slowly but growing larger in size as if the thing was coming closer to me. He kept referring to the object as a "ship" all the time). I put my hands over my eyes (comments stamped, halting over each eye, falling toward the face and elbows in stomach). I could see a red mist around me, then I passed out.
As I began to come around I was stumbling and it was dark. I couldn't see and my eyes burned. I slowly began to come back. I couldn't for the life of me remember stumbling through the palmatero. I couldn't see and my eyes burned. I slowly began to come back. I couldn't remember running toward home. I didn't even know whether or not they were hitting the ground. I thought I might be dead. Next I saw the two cell flashlight. It is still missing.
16. He said that he was unable to sleep that night before. He said that he was unable to sleep that night before. He said that he was unable to sleep that night and finally went to sleep by taking several sleeping tablets. He grabbed that he had a dream in which he was fighting with the object and was fighting with the object. Upon waking, he found that he had lost the flashlight.  
17. Upon being reininterrogated as to times, he stated that he went into the weeds nearly exactly 9:45 p.m. He said for the boys to leave for help after 10 minutes. As near as he can determine from the fact, he was 4 minutes getting to the edge of the palmetero clearing.
18. Upon being reinterrogated about the color that he saw, he stated that it was an intense shiny green and he had never seen anything like it before. He could not state and knows how that material is made. He is not certain whether it was translucent or solid.
19. Upon being reinterrogated he went back over the following points:
a. It was hotter than standing next to an oven, more like walking beside a furnace.

into an oven". The hunt was concentrated down. The further he went under the object it got lower. He stated he was prajler was cold when he came out from under the object.

a. I'd a red wist anguipfled his. He was not conscious of any chang
in temperature when he got his arm from under the object as if he had not felt any burn as was go scared. His eyes were closed on the object.

e. When he came to he was in the palmstips before he finally realised

d. He felt no demeach of any kind. He did hear a bubbling sound, it was possible the object's in the sky however, he was not sure of this.

e. He heard a hissing sound after he entered the clearing and noticed the object. He heard the hissing all the time he was conscious.

f. He was asked the small of his hat to see if the odor might still be clinging. However, it was none.

20. A discrete attempt was made to try to get Mr. to discuss the details surrounding the incident. He stated a movie man had seen it seen a movie when the words collide", but that was all. He did not need flying saucers" or "anything untoward" delues the Hollywood had notified the neighbors of a couple of the

21. Mr. stated that several people had contacted him regarding his story. They were: 1) a specialist case to his store to see him. The scientist of his name and address were unknown. 2) a person from the University of Arkansas person told him to make a recording. 3) from the Union Arkansas radio station offered him cash for his story. 4) a newspaper woman that he had known since high school days called him regarding his account. Comment: The above accounts are strictly hearsay. They were not checked by the investigator to tell how important the was.

22. Mr. stated that he had two comments to make. They were: 1) He (probably meaning the United States) can't defy anyone. He doubted that it was manufactured object. 2) He probably meant that, since we are reaching out into space, someone else may be and are possibly ahead of us. He said he believed that the object was probably from outer space.

23. Mr. then asked what he should do, if he should talk to people regarding the air Force and not talk to anyone if he was not supposed to. He was advised that.

By Capt Ruppelt that it was the policy of this project not to ask any civilian to exhibit any information, and the fact that some of the public were trying to watch him up, and call the newspapers and give them the story to "get them off his neck." He seemed to be so many newspaper people and others who are interested. He decided to take front page in throwing ground such their as people newspaper and offering money, photographers had called, Time magazine had called, radio station had called, etc.

The image contains two photographs. The first photograph shows a wide, open area with trees and vegetation. The caption states that this is a photo of the "first clearing and palmetto thicket" and that the direction of the thicket is unclear, so its extent could not be determined. The second photograph shows a dense palmetto thicket, with local citizens stating that it was "crawling" with vegetation.

Photograph No. 2 -- This shows the palmetto thicket at the approximate point referred to in the sketch. It gives an idea as to the height and density of the palmetto growth. Local citizens stated that it was 'crawling' with vegetation.

Photograph No. 1 - - This is a photo of the first clearing and palmetto thicket which was encountered on the way through the area. The direction of the thicket is unclear and, for so far as could be determined, this path might directly up to the center of the photograph into the palmetto thicket.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or memorandum for record dated 12 September 1952, regarding a report of a trip to West Palm Beach, Florida, to investigate a sighting of unidentified aerial objects by a Mr. Leonard.

The text in the document is as follows:

Memorandum for Record
SUBJECT: Report of a Trip to West Palm Beach, Florida, to Investigate Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Objects by a Mr. Leonard.

1. On 3 September 1952, Capt B.L. Reams and Lt. R.C. Olsson travelled to West Palm Beach, Florida, to conduct a further interrogation and investigation of a Mr. Leonard, who had reported seeing a strange object at approximately 1900 EST on the 8th of September 1952, concerning the Intelligence report of September 9, 1952.

2. A conference was held with Capt Carney to determine whether or not there has been any data added to determine whether or not the two USAF officers were not familiar with. Capt Carney stated that to his knowledge there was nothing contradictory to the report of supposed anonymous threatening telephone calls that Mr. Leonard had received. He stated that approximately two weeks ago (i.e. September 2) the threatening calls had ceased and that no further reporting of this case would therefore be needed while Mr. Leonard was at work in the establishment in which he is employed. The calls were concerned and he was advised that threatening phone calls were not an Air Force matter, and he should report any further calls to the local police. Capt Carney also stated that a Mr. S----, a nearby rancher, had been interviewed and had stated that a B-52 bomber had flown over the area on the evening in question and that this proved that the object reported by Mr. Leonard had been a ranch fire and that he had been mistaken. Capt Carney stated that he did not wish to pursue the matter further as there appeared to be no further developments and that he had determined that the object had been a ranch fire.

3. Capt Carney also stated that he had talked to a Mr. S----, who has been assisting Capt Carney and had indicated to him in the process that the Base Legal Officer from the West Palm Beach Air Force Base was disturbed and insisting that more information be obtained, even though Capt Carney had stated that as far as he was concerned he would not take an investigation but felt that the case was closed. Capt Carney was also asked whether or not he believes his story, naturally Capt Carney did not commit himself.

4. On the morning of 9 September 1952, Capt Olsson and Lt. Clason took a staff car into West Palm Beach in an attempt to find out more about the case and to determine whether or not they had possibly heard any rumors or could give any leads on the case. They indicated that naturally they were not officially interested in the case and that they had received no directions from their higher authority to pursue the case. The B.I.I. agent did state, however, that the BALL incident did appear to have caused some local interest.

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this document. The document appears to be text-based and describes details related to a UFO incident in Dallas, Texas in 1952.

OCR output:

He had picked up several rumors and passed those rumors on to Capt Garney and Capt Ralph Sanger. These rumors would be at the West Palm Beach or the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office. He stated that a woman that lived in West Palm Beach had stated that she knew ??? and that he was very probably a mental case.
6. Capt Ruppelt and Capt Garney then went to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office. They interviewed a woman who had stated that she had heard some rumors about a flying saucer, but actually had never run them down herself. He also stated that he was possibly not too reliable in the fact that he was a young woman of questionable reputation.
6. The officers next talked to a Mr. G. B. Bowen another deputy at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Bowen stated that he had investigated this case and had contacted some agency in Washington, possibly the F.B.I. and had received the report of the fact that he had never interviewed the individual in the case. He said that he did not personally know anything about the case, but said that he was called upon by the sheriff's office as a consultant. He also stated that he knew nothing and that he trusted the individual's evidence and would believe anything he said. (Comments: this is a usual thing for sheriff's office to do, other individuals that they call upon to assist in the case as a consulting witness).
7. The next person to be contacted was a Mr. ?????, a part-owner of ????? Hardware Store, where Lt Olsson, Capt Garney and a Sgt Ralph Sanger of Capt Garney's office contacted Mr. ????.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Mr. **** had nothing but praise for him. He stated that he is a very good employee and he would hate to lose him. He also stated that in many ways **** seemed to be conscientious in his work. Up until 2 yrs ago he (Mr. ***) was complaining the **** was not conducting himself properly in his background. The police were called but no action was taken. On the morning of the storm he (Mr. ***) was notified by the telephone that the storm was approaching and he immediately called up **** and told him to come in. It was a very violent windstorm and did quite a bit of damage to his home. Mr. **** stated that his home was not damaged as severely as some of the others in the area. The most outstanding features was the tarp had been over a portion of his house with the tarpaulin and stated that he had crawled upon the roof and placed the tarp over the house since it was raining so much. He stated that the roof had been damaged and he was necessary to have this tarp placed. He further stated that the tarp had been brushing up against a 220 volt high tension line. The fact that the tarp had been grounded and removed caused him to believe that it was very likely to have caught on the roof in his storm and removed the tarp. At this time Mr. **** was not employed by the ********** and was from what he could ascertain about the whole thing there is a possibility that this tarp had been blown on the ground (where it appeared to be). All in all, Mr. **** had nothing but praise for him.

9. Dr. **** a physician in West Palm Beach, was contacted by Capt Garney and Capt. Kuppel. Dr. **** has been retained by the Police Department as a consultant. He stated that he is somewhat familiar with this aspect of medicine. He stated that he had had several contacts with this doctor and that he had been working at a City Service Gas Station in the city of West Palm Beach. This was approximately two years ago. He had done some other things. One of the instances was when they were having a meeting of many dealers in the southern part of Florida. He did not elaborate on these statements and since it was obvious that he appeared interested in psychiatry and psychology and the treatment of mental conditions, it appeared that this Dr. **** had some difficulty along that line.

the patient, telling them how bad off he really was. This was creating a lot of confusion in the hospital so the wheel chair was taken away from him and he was put back to bed, although at times he would telephone his Mother who would inquire about his condition and what was a bad condition he was in. This continued until Dr. Xxxxxx gave her a rather severe advice about the phone calls, knowing his grandson, that this conversation must be stopped as it was very bad for the patient. He also stated that at no time was the patient so grave as to be possibly a month, the doctor was not sure how long a period was necessary before he could be Discharged, however, he was definitely under the impression that the patient would recover. Dr. Xxxxx claimed paralysis, etc., was strictly hysterical and was not due to any injury or disease.

10. Mr. Xxxxx was contacted next. He stated that his only connection with the case was that Mrs Xxxxx had contacted him and requested the status of the claim, etc., but that the insurance company had found no injury and did not intend to pay. He stated, however, that he didn't remember the case very well and that the insurance company was still corresponding with letters from Mrs Xxxxx requesting the status of the claim.

11. Dr. Xxxxx was contacted by Capt Xxxxx and it Xxxxx. He stated that Mr. Xxxxx had worked for their garage as a mechanic starting in July 1950. He said that on the date of the accident Mr. Xxxxx was a very good worker and they couldn't go ten feet in the automobile without him having to stop and rest. He said this was very prone to exaggerate on all stories and that several times had done several things during their absence. On one occasion while they were in their office and the two other people left, there was a beer box wagon followed that they found that during their absence, Mr. Xxxxx had never proven in his ability. However, the time he had passed out checks. He was employed by these people when the automobile fell on him off the hoist.

Here is the text from the document:

After the interview with Capt. Garney's officers, they returned to West Palm Beach International Airport to Capt. Garney's office. This was about 2 o'clock on the afternoon that the incident had just taken place. It was understood that Capt. Garney did not want any of this reported and he stated that if the press got hold of this incident it would be very serious. The officers stated that the incident had just left his office after conferring with him. Garney hesitated a little bit because he had not expected this answer but did think that this was just another incident of which he had had a number recently and which he attributed to jet fighters that had left that afternoon that had broken his contract with them.

He stated that when he had broken his contract with the jet fighters, he advised with the Air Force and said that any reputable editor in the United States would contact him before he bought the story and the last thing he would be to do would be to drag his friends' names in the public prints. He stated that when it came to release this story, that the Air Force would be glad to welcome the story, but they would not like to connect the names. 

On 13 September 1952, Capt Ruppelt and Capt Garney attended a boy scout meeting in a church in West Palm Beach, Fla. in order to address the boy scouts who had complained about the incident and to talk to a Mr. Capt. who was the boy scout troop chairman. They were rather excited and nervous about the whole thing and in many ways rather unnerved about it. Capt Ruppelt was impressed with Capt. Garney, however, Capt. Garney was a little bit nervous. All three men collaborated the first part of the incident so it will be given as a general statement. 

They stated that they did not see a straight nose, however, they first went out to a local restaurant and they had a cold drink and proceeded in the direction of a drive-in theatre west of West Palm Beach. The boys were under the impression that something was going to happen and they decided not to go to the drive-in. However they were very vague about this point. This was the only time in the interview that they seemed to be attempting to cover up anything. It was not determined exactly what they were trying to cover up, or anything. They arrived at this conclusion which is used for some our feeling and stated that they were under the impression was going to be a special incident which they decided not to go through, but the track and there were no cars in progress at the time. They stayed at the track for several minutes and then departed toward the street for several minutes and then departed toward the street for a military installation until toward the track. They stayed at the track for several minutes and then departed toward the street for a military installation.

Transcription of the text:

"boys' home. (Comment: It seemed rather odd to the interrogating officers that they would go to an abandoned path where bright lights appeared to be, and then investigate the location. One of the boy's fathers has something like this happen before, and it seemed that something of this nature had happened in the track. Secondly, the officers were informed that it is the policy to take the boys' scouts on training ground the site of what fell in order to show this difference in factories, plants, etc. However, this does not satisfactorily account for the fact that the boys voluntarily admitted themselves to authorities.) The boys said they saw the lights at about 9:00 P.M. 
The first thing that happened was that they suddenly observed the bright lights and then the lights went out. The boys stated that there were two blue lights, about the size of automobile lights, and that they were about 45 degrees into the trees. One of the other boy scouts say this and got back into the automobile that they had been driving down the dirt road and looked out of the window and saw one of the other two boys. One of the boy scouts saw this and got a flashlight and shone the beam of light toward the space where they had seen the lights go out. No results. At this point they decided to investigate, and the three boys approached the object very cautiously. They observed that the object was about 40 feet in the air and about 100 feet away. They stated that the object appeared to be about 45 degrees into the trees, cylindrical in shape, and about 30 feet in diameter. The object and the lights on it went out completely. The boys asked him what he was going to do and he said that he would call the police if he had a dime. However, he said that he shouldn't go back into the woods and disturbed them. The boys claim that they could see his outline in the car, started down the road when one of the boy scouts by the name who had originally seen the lights got out to shut off the lights. At this point, all he was carrying was one flashlight. He had originally seen the lights go out. At this point, all he was carrying was one flashlight. He had originally seen the lights and then stated that they would see his flashlight going back into the woods. This will be given separately."

to be rather silly about the whole thing.  He couldn't seem to concentrate on the other hand, although he was not considered a good observer in the first place, these straightest answers.  Both of these boys seemed to have first sightand got out, but they admitted that it was a strange affair and waited some minutes before they went on. Then they saw a white light, however, he states it looked to him like a common, ordinary searchlight shining up into the sky.  The white lights that he could remember. They both say that the light finally went out after a few seconds, at least the light disappeared. They said they looked up and then it disappeared again. The lights were not making any definite pattern, some of them were going up, some were going down or appearing around in all directions.  It looked to them like the lights were jumping around and disappearing. They got out of the car and ran down the road to get help.  The boys stated the man in trouble and to make a phone call, which the people did.  Soon afterwards she broke down about the light to the people before either the sheriff or the deputy who showed up.

16.  All in all the Investigators were having a difficult to obtain any facts.  The only one fact that seemed to stand out in all of the interviews was the fact that they did seem to be going out in the direction they had gone in. 

17.  After the boy scouts were interrogated, a long discussion was held with Dr. X, who was the troop chairman.  He stated that his first contact with this case was when he would be understood in what he said to appoint a scout master and heard that a scout master and heard that a and scout master ha been given some kind of a shock and that he had been consulted about the thing that he had never heard about was that he had been in an automobile accident (etc, The automobile had flipped over and he had been very ill for a while. He stated that his first reaction when he heard about it was that it was not exactly normal, and he was interested to help his members.  He pointed out a cabinet they were making in the boy scout headquarters, and he said that the boy scouts had strange shapes and forms upon it and that he thought it was something that had been drawn upon it.  He said that the boy scouts were only four months old, could walk and talk and had a number of teeth. The doctor knew that this was rather unusual and would not tell such a story.  He was given interested enough to make a special effort to see the child, not that he believed it, but he seemed to want to double check the story.  He stated that after he saw the child, he was under the impression that something unusual had actually occurred.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an excerpt from a text document. I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

that the baby was strictly normal for a four month old child. Dr. L. M. also stated that in general the history ggiven by the motherwas correct. She had been taking the baby to a doctor in Dallas for a number of months, because the baby had a rash and didn't seem to be gaining weight properly. The doctor had examined the baby and said that since they were all interested in his experience, that the child might have questions which he couldn't answer to his satisfaction. He also stated that what the mother told me concerning the similarity to other cases he had heard from hearsay and suggested that we contact a Mr. Tom White, an expert of the local plumbing concern.

13. On the morning of 10 September 1952, Capt Garney and Capt Bostridge along with Lt Dixon completed their investigation of this case. Mr. was also called in as his brother, who knew Mr. , stated that they got to know him in September 1951. This was because it was a common thing for people to come to see his brother about unusual happening. They stated that they were familiar with him and considered him a "kind of wild", "fun-loving", and "a prankster". They said that they were familiar with him in weekends. They stated that he pulled a several pranks while he was at the military dispensary one of the most outstanding ones was dying his hair. They stated that at one time he would ask people all the time to come and see something or other at the dispensary. At the conclusion of the investigation, one of them said that they had done this, he changed colors and dyed his hair so many times his scalp began to peel. But the last they heard of him at the military dispensary was that he had gone AWOL and as far as they knew were never disciplined for it. They stated that in their opinion he was not a reliable witness and true, he would have had to have graduated from some high school. They are not sure how many times they saw him was about a year ago. He had just finished working in the laundry and had his accident. He had then told them that a car had fallen on him and that he lay under the car for several hours. according to their information, this incident happened over a year and a half ago. They stated that this incident proved that there had been some right there when he had fallen. (No one had been able to check and he said that he had been driving automobiles in stock car races.)

Burned by a Flying Saucer
The amazing story of a man who chased mysterious lights and came face to face with the terror
by Martin Caidin

I had heard about Sonny DesVergers' encounter with the flying saucer. The details were sketchy. When I finally ran down Sonny, I got the full story. And it is the most hair-raising tale I have ever heard!...

(The text continues to narrate the story of Sonny DesVergers' encounter with mysterious lights and a UFO.)

Ned by a Flying Saucer
by Martte Robinet
Encounter with 
the Blue Boy Fiends
On Aug. 1, 1952 a middle-aged accountant was digging in the garden of his home when it had happened. After that, he'd drive me over and let me have a look at the soil near the center lane where the lights were really observed. I asked. He only knows what I've told him -- nothing more. The beings appeared to be a little over 5 feet in height, clad in some kind of blue uniform or coveralls. I've been trained never to identify or name any humans in the image, so I will refrain from describing the smaller inset photograph further. 
The beings on the craft seemed human-like in form, but their faces were not distinct. The craft itself was hovering a few feet off the ground, and it emitted a pulsating blue light. The accountant reported feeling a sense of terror and dread when encountering this strange sight. Overall, the document appears to be describing a reported UFO sighting and encounter with unusual beings.

BURNED BY A FLYING SAUCER
(Continued from page 4)
We laughed. Then Patlin asked, level-glance, she was frankly hesitant as she peered out at us from behind her screen door. "Golly, has been in bed with the flu," she explained, then added: "I'll see if he wants to talk."
She disappeared and led us into a room charming with bright chintz, Bobby was on a davenport.

"He's an intelligent lad," Patlin had told me before we arrived. "He's older than the other two Scouts. I was particularly impressed with the way he gave me his story that night."

Bobby's reticence to discuss the affair was noticed. He had been looking inward and pensive, as he often was after Scout meeting. Finally, when Bobby didn't get home that night, we were terribly worried. It didn't help much when we got the call that they were at the sheriff's office.
"Why don't you want to talk about it?" I asked.
He looked straight at me. "I've been teased at school," he said simply. He added this bluntly: "I wish it had never happened," he said, word for word Sonny's statement.

They had been driving down Military Trail toward Boynton, he said, when Sonny first saw the lights. There were six or so of them, strung together like the windows of an airliner, and they were flying low.

BURNED BY A FLYING SAUCER (Continued from page 7)

in advance that there were some details he would withhold. "I'm not here to challenge." He had run into the woods with his lantern and matches, he said, leaving the boys by the car. "I went about 200 yards," he said, "Flames leaped up to 12 to 20 feet across and quicksand. When the thick palmetto growth stops snapping, you can slip into anything. When I realized I was in danger, I kept my eyes on the ground. I walked about 20 feet into the clearing and stopped."

He looked at me. "It was a funny thing. I had the feeling I wasn't there. Nothing to account for it. Just a feeling I had," he went on. "Whatever came to pass seemed to happen to somebody else, quite sufferable not."

He paused for a moment, then: "I looked up at the stars. Darned funny... It was black up there. Then about four stars a shining my lantern, never seen before. About four those were the only thing in sight. As I looked at them, I didn't look toward the surface, it couldn't have been more than a few seconds, I stood looking. But if I was all so close, there would have been no stars north to south and there were no scars."

"I could have touched it with the machete. My whole body light-rayed up with color. I see that yet. If it hadn't been for this thing, whatever you want to call it, I'd have been very close to the outer rim of the flying because, when I hurriedly backed off, it was in the open and the thing seemed to be backing off from me at the same time. Like it sensed something..."

He stopped again, groping for some way to go on.

"Do you remember that original story? "Do you see someone?" I asked.

"He thought about that. "Yes," he said, "I saw someone."

"What flying creature?" I nodded slowly.

"Would he describe what it looked like?" No, he said emphatically, that was one of the things he couldn't talk about. People would think - well, he was taking an almost religious belief in secrecy. 

"I saw it when an opening suddenly appeared in the dome," he said. It was like a ball of fire drifted toward me from the opening. It's hard to describe... it was seemed to float toward me and develop me and a stretch filled my nostrils and throat. I knew something strange and terrifying had happened to me."

He sat there, his story ended. I made some small talk about the bird and the gasoline. It wanted to leave, so Sonny's wife (who had left the car during our interview) came back to the car. And though he said something I could not understand to her, believed. His desperate, unspoken plea for my faith.

Sonny has himself admitted that he was bright and symbolic of all the mystery of the future. Sonny's wife, I thought, what a strange and the supporting testimony of both would restore my faith in the integrity of all three - Deveres, Bobby and Sonny.

The image contains a photograph depicting a man in a clearing in the woods, surrounded by burnt grass and other vegetation. The text indicates that this is an excerpt from a Project Blue Book UFO report, describing the encounter between Sonny DeVergers and a strange sight in the woods.

Text extracted from the document:

plunged right into the woods. Sonny thought it was a plane crashin". Excited, they talked of investigating the strange sight.

...

"If you don't hear from me in 10 minutes, go back to the road to that house and call the sheriff." Sonny promised to do so, and saw Bobby disappearing into the woods, downward into a dip in the road embankment and off into the underbrush.

When he failed to return, Bobby and the other two boys ran to the house and called the sheriff's office. Partin, who was cruising nearby, was contacted by radio and reached the scene about half an hour after Sonny's departure. While he was trying to go to a grassy trail where Sonny suddenly disappeared, there was a commotion near the road where Bobby had been waiting.

He was white-faced and shaking and kept repeating: "I'm coming, here I am!" His lantern was gone, but he still had his machete.

"He was a sorry sight." Partin put in. "He was talking a blue streak but he didn't make any sense."

We said good-by to the Ruffings and drove back to the trail where Sonny had stopped, just before sunset, where Sonny had stopped that night. We went through the woods - those lonely, dismal solitudes - to the clearing where Sonny had been found. There I saw the imprints in the ground where Sonny's body had been found, where the burned patches of ground were to substantiate part of his amazing story.

It was good to leave that grim place. Three hours later, I sat with Sonny DeVergers in his neat living room. His little dog was in bed. His wife and dog were absent. I studied his honest face. Here was a man reluctant to solve an unpleasant experience, yet determined not to run from it. He warned me "Continued on page 20".

The image appears to contain a document from Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The document is titled "Unclassified Report of Information on Unidentified Flying Objects" and is dated August 28, 1952.

The text in the document is as follows:

INT 319-t                                          28 August 1952

        Washington 25, D. C.

1. In compliance with letter, Headquarters, USAF, AFOIN-TC-CC-2, subject as above, 1 July 1952, the following information, as reported by the 2596th Air Force Reserve Flying Training Center, Hensley Field, Grand Prairie, Texas, is forwarded. This report was not transmitted by electrical means due to the fact that its contents are not of sufficient urgency or importance to warrant such immediate transmission.

2. Observations were reported from this area on 18 August 1952, and report was not deemed of sufficient value to warrant immediate transmission.

a. Description: One bright yellow light, no distinguishable shape, no vapor trails, made no noise, but did not blink.
b. Time Sighted: 2100c, 18 August 1952.
c. Manner of Observation: Visual-surface.
d. Location of Observer: Standing in rear of --- Dallas, Texas. V Long 96.52' and Lat 32.50', approximately one mile east of Dallas, Texas. This object appeared to be about 4,000 feet in altitude and was observed to travel from southeast to northwest but veered to north rather to northeast where it finally disappeared behind the roof tops.
e. Identifying Information on Observer: Mr. ----------, Engineering and Manufacturing Company, more than average intelligence, good eyesight, friend and neighbor, and former airline pilot.
f. Weather: 21000 Cia 1/7/32/8/T. Wind 270 @ 13/25.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK REPORT NO. 8764082
RECORD OF INVESTIGATION

1. INVESTIGATOR:  CAPT. C.H. BARSTOW, USAF
2. DATE:  AUGUST 8, 1952
3. LOCATION:  DALLAS, TEXAS
4. WITNESS:  MR. H. B. PALMER

5. SUMMARY

At 8:40 PM on 6 August 1952, Mr. H. B. Palmer, an air traffic controller at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, observed an unusual aerial object while on duty. Mr. Palmer stated that the object appeared to be a disc-shaped craft that moved at a high rate of speed and made sharp, angular turns. The object was visible for approximately two minutes before it disappeared from view. 

6. CONCLUSION

Based on the details provided by the witness, the investigating officer concludes that the observed aerial object was likely an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object's disc-shaped appearance, high-speed maneuvers, and disappearance are consistent with reported UFO sightings. No definitive identification of the object has been determined.

Text extracted from the document:

WEST PALM BEACH, FLA., Aug. 8 (AP) - A deputy sheriff and two boys who "could not stand the strain" told of their encounter with a strange object in the sky near here Thursday night. 

The object, they said, was about three feet thick at the edges and high enough at the center for men to stand erect inside.

The deputy sheriff, identified as Dallas Towne of Palm Beach, said the object was spotted about 8:30 p.m. Thursday. 

"He was excited, as though he'd seen a ghost," the reporter said. Towne would say only that he had reported his experience to the Air Force headquarters in West Palm Beach.

To the two boys, as described by the reporter, the object "looked like a huge bowl of dull metal, about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, hovering some 50 to 75 feet above the ground."

"It was silent, and gave off a strange force or attraction which the boys said they could feel," the reporter wrote. 

The boys, described only as "young," said they were so frightened that they could not stand the strain of looking at the object any longer and ran home.

Towne told the reporter that he "could not discuss the incident further" on orders "from above."

19. He had told the investigator about his discharge from the Marines and his story was that after he got back from overseas he had had some trouble with respect to share the driving from California to Florida. His passenger said that the person disappeared and it turned out that the car was a stolen car and that his story was that he was out in California with a friend and that he and a friend had decided to take a little weekend trip for possible value and psychological study. They stated that the girl had stolen the car but they got out of the charge. Several times he claimed that he was the one who had invited them over to his home on two or more occasions. They said that the odd thing was that all these people were not known to one another except through this association. He appeared to have had knowledge of a story about the disappearance of the girl.

20. Once during a birthday party he stated that during the war he was a Marines' aid but had been shot and killed in a battle somewhere. He stated that one day he was contacted by an Officer of Naval Intelligence who asked him to go on a special mission. He was taken to Washington, D.C. and then flown to the Pacific to map Japanese islands that were approachable. He stated that he was piloting a PSY aircraft along with his surveying and cartography equipment and that as they approached the islands it life raft was jettisoned out of the plane. The plane came in for a landing but crashed due to cover of darkness he could not see but was not injured. At the beginning of the story the island was 7 x 3 n. long and at the end, it was 2 x 5 n. long. About two weeks after sighting the island the weather changed all of a sudden and there was all day and night drizzling up although they had had sunshine all day. He claimed that during the job he had found something but would not say what it was and it landed at night. However, the next day the airplane and the airplane's land and brass instruments were disappearing. He inflicted his rubber raft and started paddling toward the aircraft but the Japanese found him and sank his life raft. However, he was on the island. He inflated his rubber raft and started paddling toward the shore.

Transcription of the text:

In the fact he had a Gibson Girl radio with a balloon for an antenna. He quickly inflated the balloon, crawled on it and flowed out to the PHY. As he was being helped up to the ship, i.e. people's objects, people were diving out of the hatch behind him.

During the time the saps were shooting at him and several of the officers who were behind him were shooting. Shortly afterwards he was discharged from his station, one of his comrades was killed, it is believed in another direction. One other man, a holdup man, came in shortly afterwards and told them the hatchway was blocked, so they killed him and talked his cut of the robbery, took his gun away from him and gave him another according to those statements.

21. Another story was that he had been a PRO lost pilot in the Marines and had slown down some of the brothers are civilian pilots and started to question him about it. They said it was very curious to them that he had never been in an airplane before.

22. They stated that in general they always knew a story that would compare with ours. They said our account was impossible to be able to pin him down on anything and asked him a question because he had passed several checkpoints and they were always made good shortly afterwards according to their story. They said this was a few minutes after several new instructions had been issued while in West Palm Beach and one of them was reassigned and that he had purchased an article of clothing there. Because the uniform was question stated he was in contact with what appeared to be a red light, they said it was impossible his story and the story they tell could not account for it.

23. They stated that in several cases they have either been in the presence or have heard that was a s a friendly and would voluntarily bring up his "secrecy agreement" with the Air Force and not give any details.

24. On the morning of September 1952 Capt. Hallet, Capt. Carnny, Lt. Glance, and S/Sgt Seager went out to the spot where the object was seen the night before. At the same time Capt Seagar took a glimpse and supposedly observed the object. The whole group was approximately the same spot as about 24 hours later. The first car was parked in approximately the same spot as the car was parked in the clearing where the object was located. It occurs to me that they were going into the woods to take a glimpse. The only thing the whole group did not find was the light about 7 feet above the ground and shined it directly toward the road. It was not there.

Was definitely concluded that a person in the clearing, holding a light at a normal level, could not be seen from the road. It is doubted that the palmettos grew that tall in a three week period (Comment: This may have been made about three weeks after the incident.) While at the scene of the incident, it was noted that aircraft in the traffic pattern at the West Palm Beach Airport with landing lights on appeared to be white lights coming through the woods. Aircraft on the Palm Beach scene kept their landing lights on at all times they are in the pattern.

1. On 26 Aug 52, Capt Russell of AIAM-5 telephoned Capt Carney, Intelligence Officer of the 1707th Air Base Wing, West Palm Beach International Air Port (telephone number 36401, extension 234). Capt Russell asked that the answers to the following questions be obtained and furnished to ATIC as soon as possible:

a. Is the Palm Beach County Airport used for night operations? Does the log show any landings on the night of 19 Aug 52 between 2200 and 2300? What were the exact times of the landings?
b. What was the detailed weather at Palm Beach on the 19th between 1200 and 2400? Pay special attention to thunder storms in the area and cloud cover. Were there any cloud clones or ground fog? Get temperature and humidity.
c. A Capt Zahn, Air Prose Officer on the 22 Aug, mentioned sighting an aircraft on the line seeing flares. Get complete story.
d. Did or has the tower at West Palm Beach seen any flares in the area of the sighting? Get details.
e. Did the witnesses tell the police their story before they met you? What did they say?
f. Did the witnesses tell their story to the people in the house? What did they say?
g. At what locations in Florida are there Navy balloon stations?
h. Did the deputies smell any odor when they went in to find the light? 
i. Have there been any indication that the object that would have been turned on before he went into the woods?

releases that Mr. | has acquired the services of a press agent. He stated that the press agent told him that he talked to a reporter on the 25th of Aug and that | did not intend to hold any information or any further questioning from the Air Force. | stated that the entire setup was that of his press agent to build the story up so that he could sell it.

3. Capt Cerney also mentioned that a farmer who owned the land where the sighting took place did believe that the press was staged and that he had supposedly given samples of the grass and sent them to some research organization in St. Louis to be analyzed. He also stated that this | had received several threatening telephone calls and had noticed a large black automobile cruising around near his house. Capt Cerney stated that he had no idea what this all meant and that there is a possibility that it was part of the publicity stunt that | seemed to be about to pull.

Memorandum for Record
Subject: Telephone Call to Capt Carney, 1707th Air Base Wing, West Palm Beach Municipal Airport, Florida.

1. On 18 Sept 52, Capt W. J. Ruppelt called Capt Carney, Wing Intelligence Officer of the 1707th Air Base Wing, West Palm Beach Municipal Airport, Florida, to obtain additional information on a sighting reported by Dep Pott Perkins.

The following questions and answers were obtained:

a) What density and color were the objects coming out of the radiant to which they were attracted on the night of the incident?
A: Deputy Pott Perkins.

b) Of what nature were the samples taken 40 yds from the location of the sighting? Were they definitely sandy spot or a grainy substance? 
A: The samples taken were from the location indicated to have been "attacked".

c) The grass samples had been taken from a point where there was approximately the same amount of ashes.
A: Was there any indication that the incident had ever washed or ironed before it was supposedly burned during the incident?

d) Capt Carney did not know the answer to this but said that he would obtain the answers to be relayed direct about this inquiry so that there would be no idea we thought there was a possibility that the hat might have been accepted while it was being thrown. Carney stated that he would obtain the into and wire it directly to MID.

2. Capt Carney was also requested to pass on any information that he might obtain in regard to the incident.

We were heading south on Military Trail about one quarter of a mile south of Loxahatchee Road when we saw a big glare of white light and then it went out. We stopped the car and got out to come back to the car and we started south again.
We had gone about a half mile further south when we looked back and saw six red lights where we had seen the white light. We turned around again and headed north. Then the two lights that had gone into the woods showed up again. We stopped the car and seemed with a magnet and the two lights went back into the woods. It seemed to me like some flame throwing device or something that I looked like Roman Candles except there was no noise and no sparks falling from it. It was shooting flame or something that I looked like Roman Candles almost silently for a few seconds every minute or so. We waited a few minutes and then we drove on down to the nearest house and called the highway patrol.

EXCERPTS FROM FRANK EDWARDS BROADCAST -- AUGUST 25, 1952

WASHINGTON -- A BRINK'S ARMORED CAR WAS APPARENTLY LOOKED OVER IN GREAT DETAIL BY A FLYING SAUCER OVER LOUISIANA LAST MONTH. THE DRIVER SAID HE DID NOT TOUCH. HE FELT IT WAS A TOUCH OF MYSTERY WAS ADDED TO THE CRIME BY THE FACT THAT HIS COMPANION WAS OUT FRONT AND DID NOT FEEL IT TOUCH THE CAR EITHER. HE SAID IT JUST HOVERED OVER THE CAR, WAS LOOKED WHEN THE GUARDS RETURNED TO IT, AND THAT A MAN WEARING A UNIFORM SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE GUARDS WAS SEEN LOOKING IN THE CAR.

IF THIS TURNS OUT TO HAVE BEEN A HOAX, IT BEARS MANY OF THE EARMARKS OF THE REAL THING. THE MILLION DOLLAR BRINKS ROBBERY IS STILL UNSOLVED. IN THE BOSTON CASE THE THIEVES WORE UNIFORMS AND HANDLED THE MONEY SMOOTHLY.

WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. -- SPECIAL OVER THE WEEKEND, NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE NATION CARRIED A REPORT THAT A YOUNG SCOUTMASTER IN WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, OBSERVED A FLYING SAUCER HOVER OVER HIS CAR AND THAT WHEN HE TURNED HIS FLASHLIGHT ON IT, IT WAS GREETED WITH A SERIES OF BRILLIANT FLASHES WHICH ALMOST BLINDED HIM. DETAILS...BECAUSE, HE SAYS, PENTAGON OFFICIALS WON'T LET HIM.

HE ACCUSED THE ADMINISTRATION OF GIVING MISFORMATION TO FARMERS AND DESCRIBED THE COMMUNIST MENACE IN KOREA AS THE "WORST DISASTER IN AMERICAN MILITARY HISTORY." HE WARNED RUSSIA AGAINST AGGRESSION AND DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL AMERICAN PRISONERS OF WAR ARE RETURNED FROM KOREA.

On 25 Aug 52, Thursday, P.M., I went to the flare and Signal Branch in Building 156 to investigate a report and possible occurrence of flares in the sky over Dallas that and arms being turned by a flare.

From the pictures of the described but they gave the opinion that a flare could have done the job. Small cotton particles dropped from flares as they illuminated the sky and could have caused the 3 pinhole burns in the cap. The search on the base was unable to explain, but it appears that one building that one building had lights might have given the impression effect.

There are 2 types of flares generally used, all shot from a Very pistol--parachute type 2-non-parachute type. The hand flare without the pistol is also used. The flares turn at an intense heat 1000° F and upwards and can burn up to 40 seconds. It was discussed that the smoke from the flare gave the impression of something more but it was decided that a flare was used and there was no evidence to indicate anything more.

At West Palm, a fire would have started in the dry grass. No evidence of fire was present down where the ground was burned down.

I told Berger and the other flare experts the whole story, but they stated that everything seemed to point to the use of a flare being shot at him. They said a parachute flare floating down could cause this illusion. Anything from the near by high tension wires was mentioned as a possibility also. (A flare usually turns all the way to the ground.)

A significant fact lies in the fact that the parachute flare remains at a height of 500-600 feet for an appreciable time, and it was dark and the flare was shot off for some distance, and this caused the wind to establish if the smell was in the area of the firing.

Flare people offered to help Project Blue Book at any time in the future.

On 21 August 1952 at approximately 8:40 A.M., Major Fournet of the I/I called Captain Ruppelt and asked whether or not we had received a wire from West Palm Beach, Florida. ATIC had not received the report and Major Fournet was so advised and stated that he could not read the report over the phone. However, he did ask that someone go to Florida and find out the answers to the following questions:

1. What was the chemical analysis of the cap and remains of the clothes?
2. Examine the forward.
3. Examine the ground with a geigercounter.
4. Reinterrogate the three boyswouts and determine the altitude at which they first saw the blob.
5. What vegetation is in the area?
6. Was the flashlight on the ground near his hand when he regained consciousness?
7. Is the scout master subject to fainting spells?
8. All circumstances surrounding the sighting, such as:
a. How far away were the three boyswouts? 
b. What caused them to look up?
c. What was the purpose of the trip?
d. How far were they away from the scout master?

Captain Ruppelt,

These remarks should clear up the questions which you asked in our recent telephone conversation.

Weather report: Beam 1600 to 2000 hours, 23 August 1952: Wind 290 to 300, 10 to 15 knots (estimated), visibility 3 to 5 miles, stratus, scattered to 75%, Ceiling 2,500 ft., Base 1,500 ft., visibility variable weather 9/10th cumulus.

Rel Alt 1230 - 1300: 2,000 ft scattered, no lightning visible, Temp. 75.
No low clouds or ground fog at station.

Capt XXX, re: red flares on 21 Aug 52, could not locate.
No evidence of unusual or unusual comments sighted by tower personnel during past two weeks.

People flying where boys were reported and Deputy Sheriff told them about 14:00 and evil spirits before coming into contact with some.

Between living directly across the road from place where starting occurred, were contacted and stated they did not arrive home until after the incident occurred.

Deputy Partin states that there was no unusual odor when he arrived on the scene.

Key West Naval Station has blimp. It is possible the station at Jacksonville may have one, but we could not get a positive answer on them.

We received the machine in this return mail. We will see that for your, don't hesitate to call on us.

Captain Carney

P.S. The speciments we've been analyzing appear to be of the way under a separate cover.

Dear Captain Garney:

We have received your letter for verification with reference to articles and items concerning it to you under separate cover. Please return it to the Naval Facility.

The Aeronautical Laboratory here at Wright Field continues its lab data programs. We thank you for your cooperation. They are still investigating the matter which was the topic of your concern, but no records for public disclosure only. We have sent it on to Washington for further study.

It will keep you informed of things as they develop and would appreciate your desire to the same. Thank you again for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

Subject: Examination of the Machine Carried by A. of the Reynolds' Survey.

1. On the morning of 22 Aug 52, Lt. R. H. Olsson took the machine which Mr. [REDACTED] was carrying at the time he supposedly contacted an unidentified aerial object to Equipment Lab to have it checked for radiation. It was thoroughly checked by members of the Equipment Lab with a geiger counter and it was determined that it was in no way radioactive.

The memorandum discusses the purpose of the visit, the examination of the hat, and the conclusions drawn about burn marks observed on the hat.

Memorandum for Record
25 August 1952

Subject: Analysis of Maj. R. Harlan's Hat

On the morning of 25 Aug 52, Lt R. H. Olsson contacted Major R. Harlan in the Clothing Research Division of the Medical Unit of Aero Med Lab. Purpose of the visit was to show Maj Harlan the hat that had been worn by Mr. _____ and to determine some facts about the burned spots. Maj Harlan examined the hat and determined that the three spots that were believed to be burns were, in fact, burned, and that the part of the hat that appeared to be scorched was actually scorched. He stated that it would be possible for the hat to be scorched, but not turn the skin of the wearer since cotton turns at between 200 and 500 F°, at which time it starts to disintegrate and carbonize. From the scorching on the hat, it appeared that the hat was present for only a short time. Maj Harlan believed that due to that short period of time, the skin could escape without suffering burns.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper clipping with text. The text appears to be an article about a "publicity agent" who will "protect" a man after a "saucer" incident. The article discusses the details of an incident where a man reported a "phosphorus effect" and a "saucer" that was seen by the Air Force in Washington. The article also mentions that the Air Force has "no legal evidence" to substantiate any claims about flying saucers.

JOURNAL HERALD, DAYTON. OHIO, MONDAY. AUGUST 25, 1952

Publicity Agent Will "Protect" Man After "Saucer" Incident

WEST PALM BEACH, FLA., AUG. 24 - A newscaster who said he was for the Air Force and said flying saucers don't exist, has turned up, according to the Air Force, in a "publicity stunt" involving five civilians and the Air Force. 

The newscaster, who announced he has made a "statement" regarding the details of a "saucer" incident, will presumably be "protected" by a publicity agent. 

There was a "phosphorus effect" around the incident, it was said; "the lights" went and "came on" again. 

Presumably, the announcement that a publicity agent will "protect" the newscaster's interests will not reveal anything new. The Air Force has stated that they have no legal evidence to substantiate claims about flying saucers.

"I believe it was under and near the saucer as it approached," the newscaster said. "It seemed to be about three-quarters of a mile in diameter and it was 30 feet from the ground and stayed about 15 minutes. The next thing I knew, the lights went out and everything went black. When the lights came back on, I was about 50 feet from the ground and a tire was burning on my car."

He said there was a hole in the saucer about a yard in diameter.

"I'm not even looking up in the sky anymore," he said. "I'm scared."

According to the Air Force, the newscaster's hair on his arm was singed, "apparently caused by some burning of electrical nature." 

They said he was in his scout cap last week "indicating only a day-to-day trip."

An officer from the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Field, Ohio, went to Florida to check on the incident. However, officials said the investigation was "inconclusive" and "only field reports" were received.

But the Air Force said that a WPAFB spokesman said the Army has examined and re-examined him, "they gave me a bill of health."

Ex-Marine Describes 'Saucer Attack'
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--An ex-Marine told his wife and neighbors about a strange incident which happened to him Monday night near Dallas, Texas.  The former Marine said it was a "saucer-shaped" object that attacked him.  He left the house in his car with his wife and neighbors to investigate.
As he sped through the brush, the object is said to have followed him.  The ex-Marine said he could hear the "thump, thump, thump" sound of the object right under his car.
According to the report, there was a bright light which seemed to be "playing" on the car, and the car radio was affected in some way.  The ex-Marine said he was so frightened that he almost wrecked the car.
Investigators are taking this report seriously, as they feel it may be another case of a "flying saucer" encountering a citizen.  No further details are available at this time.
