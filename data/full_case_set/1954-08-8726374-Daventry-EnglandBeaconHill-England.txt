INTERPLANETARY INTELLIGENCE
OF
FLYING UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA.
18 July 1960

Lt. Colonel Lawrence J. Tacker, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Colonel Tacker:

(1) In accordance with paragraph 8 of AFR 200-2, I should like to request the analysis of the film taken of UFO's, mentioned by Major Herb Schirmer, USAF Public Information Officer for the Oklahoma City Air Force Station, Okla., in a letter dated 27 June 1960.

(2) I would like to thank you for sending me a copy of AFR 200-2 as amended; your courtesy is appreciated.

(3) That is ATIC's analysis of the 8mm color motion pictures of UFOs taken on 2 July 1960, which we forwarded to the USA for analysis.

(4) I should appreciate receiving a copy of the new AF fact sheet, when issued.

(5) Does the Press Release 10 September 1957, the total of UFO sightings for 1956 is listed as 778; of this number 2.2% is listed as "Unknown". By my calculations, this figure out of 778 is 17.32. Several of the other statistics are also uneven; please advise me what 9/23 or 99/100 of a sighting is?

(6) Have you or the Air Defense Command any further UFO sightings by rockers? Is other means upon Unidentified Flying Objects? Is there an ADC order in effect authenticating such findings? If so, and they are not classified, I should like to request copies.

(7) Does the United States Air Force exchange information on UFOs with the Air Force of friendly nations?

Sincerely yours,

JAMES MANEY
Deputy Director

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-H2X    1 AUG 1960

SUBJECT: UFO Information (James Haney)

TO: SAFOI-3d (L/Col Tacker)

1. The following is in reference to numbered paragraphs of letter, copy attached.

a. Reference paragraph one, this Center has no record of UFO's sighted over Oklahoma City during August 1954.

b. Reference paragraph three, this Center has not received the film listed as "Motion Picture" over to the Air Force.

c. Reference paragraph six, ATIC has no information to the effect that ADC has filed an administrative firing defect. ATIC has no information concerning an ADC order which forbids firing on anything which gives indication of being a friendly aircraft. It should be noted that Air Force records, from the time that ADC's piloted gunnery training programs were in existence, clearly show that the interpretation of these instructions as absolutes are, of course, at a higher rate during wars or other periods when combat is imminent.

d. Reference paragraph seven, a limited amount of information concerning the U.S. Air Force and friendly foreign nations' policies on the control of UFU reports that are made in the United States each year.

5 August 1960

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 16 July concerning unidentified flying objects.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has no record of a UFO sighting at Oklahoma City during August 1954. Provided it was reported to a nearby air force base at that time, this would indicate the sighting was probably solved locally. Tinker Air Force Base and the Oklahoma City Air Force Station had officers on duty who would have shed some light on this sighting, or the cause. In any event, the long interval of time since that visual sighting has further investigated this case by the Air Force.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has no information to the effect that ADC pilots have fired on unidentified flying objects or flying saucers. You must keep in mind that air force is clogged by law with the air defense of the United States and must contact, intercept, and identify any and all aerospace objects as they pose any security risk. Security and the necessary efforts to achieve it probably gives rise to the report that ADC pilots "have orders to shoot down UFOs."

Category percentages of UFOs published in official Department of Defense releases are straight membership comparisons carried out to only two places and because of this were worked in reverse, they will not reflect the actual credible totals logged in reverse by date.

A limited amount of information concerning unidentified aerial phenomena is exchanged between the U.S. Air Force and certain nations. For your information, no other country has near the volume of UFO reports that are made in the United States each year.

As requested I am including the latest Department of Defense fact sheet, dated 21 July 1959, on this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
