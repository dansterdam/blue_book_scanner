PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE/HOUR: 20/0216Z
2. LOCATION: ATTANASIO, VIRGINIA
10. CONCLUSION: ASTRO PROS MOON
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer stated that "At first there was a small spot in the sky and it grew slowly in size. It held its position for some time and then slowly disappeared. As it grew smaller the second one started to appear the same way." The second one then disappeared like the first one.
COMMENTS: The Investigator felt that the observation was of the moon fading in and out of visibility due to conditions of the ground and out of the 230 deg at the time. Dr. Hynek agreed with our evaluation of prob.s soon through clouds.

LYNCHBURG CONTROL TOWER (15 MILES NORTH OF SIGHTING) RECEIVED ONE CALL AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME AS REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER. THEY REPORTED SEEING NO OBJECT. ROANOKE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT (50 MILES WEST OF SIGHTING) WAS ALSO CALLED AND THEY REPORTED RECEIVING A NUMBER OF CALLS AT THAT TIME. THE INVESTIGATOR NOTED AND NOTICED A FADING IN AND OUT OF THE MOON IN THE WESTERN SKY. THEY ATTRIBUTE MOVING CLOUDS IN FRONT OF THE MOON AS BEING THE CAUSE FOR THE ALARM, CAUSING THE FADING AND BRIGHTENING ACTION REPORTED BY OBSERVER. THE UFO INVESTIGATOR WOULD TEND TO BELIEVE THIS REPORT FROM THE ROANOKE CONTROL TOWER AND ATTRIBUTE THE TWO OBJECTS REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER AS BEING TWO PARTS OF THE MOON'S REFLECTION VARYING IN LIGHT INTENSITY.

The image contains a compass-like diagram at the top, which appears to be providing guidance on how to describe the direction and orientation of a UFO sighting. Below the compass diagram, there are two sketches or illustrations depicting some type of landscape or horizon views.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

IF THE PHENOMENON SEEN WAS NOT STATIONARY, PLEASE INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IT WAS MOVING AND HOW IT MOVED - STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a UFO report, with a form-like structure and handwritten responses.

AFR 80-17(CI)
DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE SIZE - HOW DID IT CHANGE AND DESCRIBE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE COLOR?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

The handwritten response to "WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?" is:
We were returning from a carnival ride and I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star and it seemed to get a little closer to us, it was unusual because of the steady and unchanging bright light and also it did not seem to conform to the movement of the other stars in that portion of the sky. We watched it for several minutes and it did not seem to be moving very much, then suddenly it shot straight up at a terrific speed and disappeared entirely, the manner in which it disappeared was quite unnatural compared to an airplane or star or other familiar celestial objects, and that is what drew our attention to it in the first place.

The handwritten text states:
"27" long moved, or was clearly lowered and leaned to the right. Two went into the fog of the night, and three headed off..."

POSITION OR SECOND ONE AS POINTED TO DISAPPEAR.

The provided sketch shows two crescent shapes, likely representing the positions or movements of the objects described in the handwritten text.

BASED ON YOUR SKETCH, HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH, HOW IF YOU HAD COMPARED THE OBJECT TO A MATCH HEAD, HOW MUCH OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED.

The provided response to this question states: "1/5 of it".
