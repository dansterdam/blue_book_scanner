STATEMENT

On 7 October 1952 at 2030 hours, in the Starlight Drive-In Theatre in Alamogordo, New Mexico, while driving through the place with a friend, I noticed a single spot of light in the sky, about a third of a thumbs length in height, the hand being held at arm's length. It was in the center and left side and seemed to be stationary and pale blue in color. After a short while it began to dwindle in size and finally disappeared. I saw it about 60 seconds from the position on the north side of the theatre lot.

It appeared to move towards the east and then to the overhead. I figured that it was almost north of us. It traveled about a thirty degree arc to the east and overhead. The impression I had was that it turned on its side, as well, and got smaller, but not necessarily smaller. It was not possible to estimate the actual size, distance, or altitude of the object. It was so small at first that it was nearly impossible but the physical characteristics indicated that it was a controlled, intelligently guided craft. The second thought was a re-evaluation of the visual observation, but this we could not get because we lost sight of it. All we could say was that it was a new, strange, unfamiliar phenomenon, and we did not know what to make of it. I thought at first that it was a planet, as Venus, but quickly dismissed that thought since it did not look like that and was moving differently. It was observed with the naked eye and I both noticed it at once without special effort.
