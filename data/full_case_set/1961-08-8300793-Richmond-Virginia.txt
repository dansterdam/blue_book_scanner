light standing stationary in the sky, then moving off, stopping and reversing course immediately to chase another displaye, I thought it strange. The Ashland man said his sighting was to the south. And, because Ashland is north of Richmond, and my sighting was to the north, it is probable that we both saw the same thing.

What ever the object was, it definitely descended from a high altitude to abruptly whine past and disappear in the skies. At the time it was traveling through the area, it created a marked silence nor could its movement be accompanied by the sound normally characteristic of aircraft. The man reported to have seen the object said the thing startled him and on passing went out of sight in seconds, leaving him puzzled as to what he had observed.

The image contains a photograph showing a diagram or map related to the positions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn in the sky during August. The diagram appears to be from a Project Blue Book report document.

Jupiter, Saturn Shine in August

The planet Jupiter is the brightest object in the sky this month. Saturn is also a bright star-like object, according to James Sealey's reports.

The text in the document states:

"Jupiter, the brightest object in the sky this August, and Saturn, a brilliant star-like object, are both visible this month, James Sealey reports.

Jupiter is now the brightest object in the sky, even brighter than the planet Venus, and Saturn is also very bright, Sealey states.

Both planets are well placed for observation in the evening sky this month, with Jupiter reaching its highest point in the south around 10 p.m. and Saturn following about an hour later.

The two planets are in favorable position for observation in August, and their brightness makes them easy to locate, according to the report."

Text from the document:

1952 APRIL 25,69 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2395
In our files are found 13 reports of an extremely brilliant fireball which appeared on the above date at 11:52 p.m. E.S.T. Out of the 13 reports to come from Washington, D.C. and its vicinity, none were close together, but were scattered over an area about 50 miles in diameter, centering about 30 miles southwest of Washington. Five of the 13 reports were from Washington, D.C. proper. The fireball was observed as brilliant light, green and its size excessive, estimates of the latter running from one-half to three times the size of the full moon. The fireball's apparent size was from one-fourth to one-fifth the angular diameter of the full moon. Its duration was about 5 seconds, and the beginning altitude at about 40 degrees or more, and the end at north about 10 degrees or less, moving rapidly but on a shallow slant. This is the light description from the reports which are very detailed - - - - - -

The image contains a photograph of a document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s. The document appears to be a report on a "FIREBALL of 1966 July 6" observed on that date at approximately 10:58 p.m. EST. The report provides details about the observed fireball, including its start and end points, velocity, and other characteristics.

The text in the document reads as follows:

AMERICAN MOTOR ROUTE REPORT
A-15
The color of the fireball was white perhaps with a bluish tinge, but during the last part of its flight, it turned reddish. In examining the attached reports, it is stated that it was observed in the sky over Richmond, Virginia and others stated that it was observed in the sky over a wide area. The duration time given in the attached reports range from 1 to 25 seconds. Probably the longer ones refer to duration of the flight over the United States. The initial luminescence was at an altitude of 75 - 80 km. This means it was seen over a wide area of the eastern part of the United States. The fireball did not leave a persistent trail. Using the reports which seem more accurate as to magnitude as seen from different cities, the path and trajectory have been computed. The computed path and trajectory are shown on the accompanying sketch. The usual numerical data follows. An association of them will show marked similarities to August 16, 1956.

FIREBALL of 1966 July 6
A.M.S. No. 2302

Very bright fireball was reported on this date at approximately 10:58 p.m. E.S.T. from stations in Illinois and those near St. Louis, Missouri and in Iowa. The Illinois observations came from observers near Chicago. Considerable brighter than the planet Venus and having a distinct bluish-green color. It had a very sharp trailing edge or tail which remained clearly visible for several seconds. The brightness was comparable to the moon's brilliance. It had a distinct shades, was greenish-white in color. No smoke trail or audible detonation was observed. Considerable data have been obtained from various sources and an analysis of the trajectory and orbit has been computed.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - 14 AUG 61
STEVE A FAVER, a 17-year-old student, has reported to have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO) on 31 January 1961. The object was over a building several blocks away in about a minute's time. He didn't think much of it at the time.
Several weeks later the Adler Planetarium persons, almost one year before, had sighted the same object. It was reported to be metallic and shaped like a saucer. Faver was intrigued by this fact and tried to determine if his sighting could be the same object.
Faver asked that a meteorite expert from USAFOTL be consulted to get an opinion. He has viewed many meteor showers and said this was not similar to any meteor shower he had seen. Asked what he thought it might have been, he replied, "I honestly do not know."

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION ON REPORTED UFO SIGHTING AT EVANSTON, ILLINOIS, 12 MAY 61

NO CASE INFO ONLY LAST MONTH WE REPORTED AN EVANSTON, ILL., SIGHTING CONCERNING AN OBJECT OBSERVED ON SPUTNIK IV. LAST MONTH WE REPORTED AN EVANSTON, ILL., SIGHTING CONCERNING AN OBJECT OBSERVED ON SPUTNIK IV. FOLLOWING ECHO E ACROSS THE SKY. WHEN FIRST SEEN, THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT 10° TO THE LEFT OF THE MOON AND ABOUT THE SAME APPARENT SIZE. IT APPEARED STATIONARY AND THEN SLOWLY GAINED ALTITUDE AND MOVED TO THE LEFT. DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR MOONWATCH ACTIVITIES AT THE CHICAGO MOONWATCH STATION, TOM COOMBE, TAKING THE STATION'S SPEED TIME REPORT AT THAT MOONWATCH OBSERVATION, CHECKED THE OBJECT AND CONFIRMED IT WAS NOT EARTH SATELLITE OR METEOR. HE LEARNED THAT SOME "STARTLINGLY INGENIOUS MECHANISMS" FAR BEYOND OUR MENTAL POWERS, HE HAS LEARNED, THAT GO INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME APPARENTLY DISAPPEARING AS MYSTERIOUSLY AS THEY ARRIVED. MOONWATCH OBSERVERS LOST CONTACT OF THE OBJECT AS IT REACHED THE HORIZON AND IT WAS GONE. A ROUGH SPEED ESTIMATE AT TWICE THAT OF ECHO J, A MAGNITUDE GUESS OF 0. AND A HEIGHT ESTIMATE OF PERHAPS 150 MILES COULD BE FORMULATED. THIS COULD HAPPEN IN UFO RESEARCH IF PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLIC RESEARCH FACILITIES WOULD WORK TOGETHER.

EVANSTON, ILLINOIS - 30 AUG 61 Frederick Aguilard was also notched the sighting while flying a Cessna 150' and 5713' CSOE altitude. He stated the object appeared to be about half the brightness of Echo moving on a parallel course to the satellite's left, at a distance equal to three diameters of the satellite. It was going the same direction as Echo at the same case in undergoing further study. A follow-up may be expected.

An object which appeared to be a large aircraft similar to a monoplane, but somewhat larger, passed over Cincinnati, Ohio at an estimated altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The object was observed by several persons in the area and the sighting lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object appeared to emit a glow that was described as being a bright luminescence. It moved in a steady course and at a steady speed without any variation.

Dear Major Coleman:

On about 2100 hrs. on 30 Aug 61, a reddish object was seen over Richmond, Virginia. It suddenly exploded in a flash of white light. At the same time on the night of 7 Sep 61, the performance was repeated.

I would like to know the results of the official investigation into these sightings and that data on what this seems to indicate were these events based.

On 7 Aug 61 I requested information regarding the Chicago area sightings of 7 Aug 61. If possible, would you please inform me as to the action being taken on this request?

If a Department of Defense news release regarding UFO's has been issued since January, 1961, I would like to have a copy.

Your help in these matters would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Civilian UFO Research

Dear Major Coleman:

As you requested, on 4 June 1961, I sent you information regarding a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Rushville, Nebraska early in January 1961. [Redacted] approached the sighting, and advised that the sighting was still unidentified as of 25 April 1962.

Would you please send me a copy of the latest DOD News Release on the subject?

On 7 August 1961, I requested information regarding two CHICAGO-area sightings: 1) 7 June 1961, Richmond Heights, Ill.; 2) Have been trying to obtain information about these incidents for over a year. If I can get the details, I would like to ask your opinions on the cases.

On 11 September 1961, I requested information regarding a series of UFO reports (28 Aug 57) San Clemente, C hile. I would like to know the official conclusions in this case, in accordance with AFR 200-2.

Major, I have a considerable amount of patience and I feel you are competent and quite helpful. I hope you will provide the information I have requested.

Sincerely,

The text in the document is as follows:

CINCINNATI, OHIO - 30 AUG 61. (Approximately 9:00 PM) Dozens of Cincinnati residents (Approximately 200-300), very "slowly" toward the southwest. It suddenly exploded "like a great white light". This brightness scattered in various directions.

A spokesman at Greater Cincinnati Airport rejected the possibility that this incident was a local sighting. The Cincinnati Weather Forecast Office offered no explanation. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Wright Patterson AFB, ruled out moons, stars, and other space phenomena.

On the first incident, the object (9-10 miles above) appeared the same time as the second time, though witnesses closer to the object heard a soft "explosion-like" sound during a 10-15 second period when the object began to break up which indicated a sudden loss of containment pressure. The object was between 5,000 and 10,000 feet high.

The 17 Aug 61 sightings were quite similar in nature: six more days passed and at 8:57 PM, 11 Sep 61, CUFOR member Ann Bellik (who lives in the above sighting area) reported a light, hovering approx 1,000 feet above the ground, which blinked out. Although similar in appearance and direction of movement, some obvious differences appeared in the details of the sightings that might have presented a false impression. Mrs. Bellik and her husband intend to maintain vigilance and report any further sightings. Anything gleaned from this operation will be reported.

NAME: (REDACTED)

DATE: September 5, 1951

Somewhere, between 8 and 9 p.m., as I was walking across my back yard from the house to a tool house, I looked up and saw what I took to be a very brightly-lighted airplane, moving from east to west. My first thought was that it was an aircraft of the Tactical Air Command, which has headquarters near Richmond; but I checked with TAC and it did not have any tankers in this area at that time.

Also, I checked with the Air Traffic Control Regular people at Richmond's Byrd Field, to see if they had picked up anything unusual on their screen Thursday night, and they said they had not. This sighting of mine would have been well within range of the Field's radar.

After calling the Air Force in Washington, I had about decided that this was a civilian airliner, with its bright cabin lights visible through the overcast, because its speed and direction were consistent with that. But, because a man had called from Ashland with the story of a bright light, I reported the incident to the Air Force.
