1. In accordance with paragraph 13b, AFR 200-2 and based on a UFO report submitted by Captain B. Brown and Lt. Marsden (attachment 1) the following data and information is forwarded:

a. Captain B. Brown, a T-33 Instructor Pilot, age 38, and holds a B.A. Degree. His occupation involves both observation and technical knowledge. Further, Captain Brown has 6,200 hours of flying time; 1,500 hours of which was flown in the Webb AFB area.

b. Lt. Marsden is a Navigator Pilot, age 24, and holds a B.B.A. Degree. Observation and technical knowledge are involved in his training. He Marsden has over 1,200 hours of flying time and 811 200 hours were flown at Webb AFB, Texas.

2. This object was first sighted by the two pilots while airborne. The object was a bright blinking white light, round in shape. This object was approximately the size of a dime held at arm's length. Only one object was reported by the observers; therefore, no formation was sighted. There were no other pertinent features described by Lt. Marsden and Captain Brown in their report.

3. The object was first noticed by Lt. Marsden who immediately called Captain Brown's attention to it. Both pilots agree on the location and course of the object which is as follows:

a. The object was seen at 11 o'clock (relative position) and at an angle of 15-20 degrees which was approximately 4-2 NM northwest of Webb AFB. The object was stationary which was approx 42 NM northwest of Webb AFB.

b. When the light was first noted, it was stationary and a blinker as seen. However, when the pilot tried to move closer, the light appeared to move away. This action was repeated several times, and the light diminished in size as the plane turned toward it and was out of sight in 3 to 4 seconds.

c. The total length of time that the light was visible was not more than three minutes.

This page from the old UFO report document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a text-based document providing details about an observation of a UFO sighting.

4. The manner of observation was air-visual. Both observers were in T-33 aircraft (Gerard No. 56038) at an altitude of 22,500 feet. The heading was northerly from San Angelo (FORM southeast of Big Spring). The speed of the aircraft at the time of sighting was 0.93 mach and during pursuit of the object, speed increased to .95 mach.
5. The date of the sighting was 8 February 1965 and the time was 0234 hours. The lighting condition at this time was described as night.
6. The following is personal data on the observers:
a. Captain Brown, Wilber
256251 Pilot Training Squadron
356lst Pilot Training Wing
b. 2/Lt Marsden, John R.
AO31-208-154
356lst Student Squadron
356lst Pilot Training Wing
c. Both pilots are considered to be reliable.
7. Both pilots reported the sky was clear and visibility unlimited. At 22,900 feet the observers visibility was unimpaired (i.e. no thunder storms, unlimited ceiling, etc.)
8. The weather bureau's report of weather at the time was clear, with upper wind information as follows:
6,000         340°
10,000        330°  30K
15,000        310°  55K
20,000        300°  60K
25,000        280°  70K
30,000        270°  75K
9. Checking possible sources and/or causes of the reported phenomena failed to disclose any significant traffic in the area at the time of the sighting.
a. The local civilian authorities were contacted, but there was no reported sighting traffic in the area of the sighting at 0152z, 25 February 1965.
b. The TFK Test Center at Fort Worth reported there were no tests or unusual aircraft flying at the time of the sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

An interview was held with the Chief Observer at the Sweetwater Air Force Station but he had neither heard of the reported object nor had any direct object been seen on the radar equipment. This Air Force Station contacted other neighboring CGI units and it's headquarters in Oklahoma City. There was no unusual activity noted by any of these organizations.

8. Civil and federal weather stations throughout the area reported there were no weather balloons aloft at the time of the sighting.

9. No explanation can be given concerning this UFO on the basis of information received during the course of the investigation.  

10. Attachment 1 is the report submitted by the two observers.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on the night of February 24, 1965 during a night transition mission from Webb AFB in Big Spring, Texas.

The text of the document is as follows:

STATEMENT

On the night of 24 February 1965, Captain Brown and myself took off on a night transition mission from Webb AFB, Big Spring, Texas in a T-33 basic trainer, at 1900 hours. We climbed to 22,500 feet and proceeded to San Angelo, Texas, then turned north to Colorado City, Texas. Our position relative to Webb AFB was approximately 42 NM southeast. At approximately 1920 hours at an altitude of 22,500 feet, traveling at approximately .8 Mach, I sighted a round, white light at the 11 O'clock position at an angle of approximately 10 degrees elevation. The object radiated a white light of high intensity and appeared to be about the size of a dime. It was traveling on an east-to-west course and appeared north of Webb AFB. I called the light to Captain Brown's attention and as we watched it, it blinked on and off approximately 3 times. Each time it blinked off, the light was out for approximately 4 or 5 seconds and at that time no object could be seen in that position. We turned our aircraft and headed toward it accelerating to approximately .95 Mach. The position of the object in relation to us remained constant for 1 or 2 seconds. Then the object accelerated off at a very high rate of speed on a north-westerly direction. It gradually diminished in intensity and was completely out of sight in approximately 3 or 4 seconds. No discernible features could be observed of objects other than the intense white light. Total time of observation from first sighting until it disappeared was approximately 3 minutes.
