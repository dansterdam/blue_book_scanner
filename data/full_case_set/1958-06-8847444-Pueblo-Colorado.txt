U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET 
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, measurements, or sketches that may supplement the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [REDACTED]
SIGNATURE: [REDACTED]
DATE: July 24, 1958

This unidentified object was seen while [REDACTED] was on the morning of June 14, 1958 while he was in the observation dome watching Weather Bureau Balloons. The object entered the field of vision at an Azimuth of 247.5° (looking toward the east northwest) (Weather Bureau Theodolite) and proceeded on a bearing of 77° for approximately 3 minutes. The object was followed aurally with a theodolite and visually. It was described as having the following characteristics: the object was shaped like a fireball, white in color, no tail, no exhaust, and no sound. The angular elevation varied from 10° to 12° during the observation. The speed was estimated at 2000 feet per second. The object traveled a distance of about 15 miles in the 3 minutes it was observed. The observation was terminated as the object went off the field of vision at an Azimuth of 309°. It took 12 minutes (plus or minus 1 minute) for the object to travel this distance. There are no other witnesses, but the count could possibly be in error by one minute, since it could not be taken continuously due to the intermittent nature of the sighting. The object was traveling at a very high angle, the shape became quite circular as it moved across the sky. It was apparently a very bright circular object of definite shape and had a very definite and distinct outline, more so than most any lighted balloon or aircraft that could be seen from that distance.

The image provided does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a scanned document page with text only.

Upper Air winds during the day were from the southwest at quadrant, opposite to the movement of this object. Two pilots were noted observing this object, describing it as stationary for a long period, then making a very rapid maneuver. The object appeared to them to be moving in the direction of this object, but no one could state positively the direction or altitude of the object.

The estimated size of the object, the distance away and its estimated speed, as shown on this questionnaire, are all based on estimates considered to be the minimum altitude the object could have had. Calculated by its apparent size, the object could have been as much higher than 2,000 feet as 3,000 feet, and they did not see it pass the horizon. The sighting lasted only 5 minutes and then the object made a very rapid maneuver and they did not see it again. The apparent size of the object was small and the estimated altitude to be above 600 mph toward the southwest.

The image appears to be a diagram or schematic depicting a spherical or hemispherical view, likely representing a celestial or astronomical context. The diagram shows a grid of latitude and longitude lines, with various geographic coordinates and cardinal directions labeled along the edges. There is also a figure or marker at the center of the diagram, which may represent an observation point or location. Overall, the image seems to be some kind of navigational or mapping tool, potentially related to the study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or astronomical phenomena.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document from the United States Department of Commerce Weather Bureau, titled "Report on Unidentified Flying Object", dated June 18, 1958.

The text of the document is as follows:

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

June 18, 1958

Report on Unidentified Flying Object 
(seen by__________ June 18, 1958.)

While taking the Pilot Observation on the morning of June 18, 1958 at 10:37 AM MST an unidentified flying object was observed from this station. It was first noticed as a small bright spot in the clear sky to the north, rapidly gaining altitude and heading south. It was followed visually for approximately 60 seconds at which time it disappeared from sight into the bright sky. The object was described as a bright metallic-like disc, about 15' in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion. It was moving at a very high rate of speed, estimated between 500 to 1,000 miles per hour. The object was sighted at an approximate altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The 5 minute count weight height be in error by a few seconds. 

When first seen the outline of the object was not clear, but as it gained altitude and the sun struck it, a bright metallic-like reflection was easily visible. No sound was heard and no exhaust or trail was observed. The object appeared to be a flat, circular metallic-like disc. It was under observation for approximately one minute.

Upper winds during the day were from the southeast, approximately 20-25 knots. However, the object was moving in a direction opposite to the upper wind flow and at a much greater speed than could be attributed to the wind. The particular time of observation corresponded closely to the time when a rocket was being launched from the White Sands Missile Range, but it is not believed that this object was related to the rocket in any way.
