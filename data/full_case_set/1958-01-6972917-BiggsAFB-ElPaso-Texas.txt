There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

OF NCESSARY SPECIALIZED INFORMATION IT IS THE OPINION OF THE PREPARING OFFICER THAT THESE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY KNOWN AIRBORNE OBJECT, EXCEPT FOR THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE AND DISSAPPEARANCE ON THE RADAR SCOPE AND THE FACT THAT NO AIRCRAFT WERE CLEARED FOR SUCH A FLIGHT BY THE LOCAL CAA FACILITY. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT THE RADAR RETURNS COULD HAVE BEEN FROM A FLIGHT OF HELICOPTERS. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY, IS THAT THE RADAR RETURNS MAY HAVE BEEN FROM A FLIGHT OF DUCKS. IF SUCH AN EXPLANATION IS POSSIBLE IT APPEARS TO BE A REASONABLE EXPLANATION. THE RETURNS DISSAPPEARED WHILE IN THE VICINITY OF THE ONLY LAKE IN THE LOCAL AREA. RADAR RETURNS PROVIDED BY UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS APPEARS TO BE A LOGICAL EXPLANATION. HOWEVER, UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE EXISTED AT THE TIME. NO RADAR SCOPE PHOTOGRAPHY WAS TAKEN.
