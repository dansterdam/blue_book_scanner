AFR 80-17
ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1968 I WAS SENT ON A FIELD TRIP WITH ONLY A FEW HOURS NOTICE TO THE MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE AREA TO INVESTIGATE A SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT THAT HAD BEEN REPORTED. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE NAVAL AIR STATION AT MILLINGTON, TENNESSEE HAD PICKED UP THE OBJECT ON RADAR AND THAT IT HAD MANEUVERED OVER THE MEMPHIS AREA. I WAS ABLE TO INTERVIEW SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY HAD SEEN THE OBJECT AND THAT IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. HOWEVER, I WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OR OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE THEIR CLAIMS.

It seemed to move jerkily across the field of vision, changing direction rapidly. No sound was heard. There were no other objects in the field of view.

Blew out of the car and soared as an after thought the color was a silvery metallic like a stange of thin palls which you could see through was what it appeared to be. I watched it all the time in a straight line and parts started falling off and became a strange, dull appearance of what it was.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It kept going in a straight line and petered out something like a cloud, not remembering it went through that but thought it was gone.

THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
No it did not.
