TR-136-D2
31 August 1952 - 27 August 1952
Capt. R. H. Pennoyer
25 Aug 52 C-2 4. On 27 August 1952, 2 jet aircrafts seen at approximately 35,000 ft. by a radar operator. The targets were tracked for approximately 25 minutes and disappeared from the radar scope. Two operators simultaneously observed these targets on their own radar scopes. The targets appeared as two bright returns which moved rapidly in a weaving fashion at approximately 600 knots. No identification or designation of these targets has been established.
2. Significance - Unknown

HEADQUARTERS AIR FORCE
1. The objects observed by 1/Lt. Sandoval and 1/Lt. Smith appeared to be of a metallic nature and to be extremely high in altitude. The objects were observed to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed in an erratic, pendulous course. The objects were observed to be traveling in a vertical plane and at a high angle of elevation, approximately 45 to 65 degrees above the horizon. The objects were observed to increase their speed and their angle of elevation.
2. Time of Observation: 02:15 MST, 27 August 1952. This observation was made by 1/Lt. Sandoval and 1/Lt. Smith.
3. Number of Observers: Visual: 2/1Lt. Sandoval, assigned and 1/Lt. Smith, assigned. Objects were not discussed by the dark glasses.
4. Location: Observation and location of objects: Approximately 20 miles NW of Montan AFB, Arizona. Objects appeared in close proximity to the sun, 10 - 15Â° above the horizon and north of the sun's position.
5. Identifying Information on Observers and Witness: 1/Lt. Sandoval is a pilot and member of the Headquarters Squadron Section, 321 Air Force for 3.2 years. He has 2 years of experience as a F-86 pilot.
6. Meteorological and wind conditions at time of observation: visibility 40 miles, wind west at 6 knots.
7. Meteorological conditions accounting for sighting: None.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text discussing "Typical Evidence" and "Identification or Certification Action Taken" related to a Project Blue Book report.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

IR-13C-52

1. Typical Evidence:
a. Terrain characteristics of project location:
(1) Nota 3 is located a park
(2) Locate 3 18 residence

1/15/52 or 2 observed that the terrain was extremely rugged, with steep cliffs and canyons in the area, which would make it almost impossible for anything to land in the immediate vicinity without detection by the observers or others in the area.

2. Identification or Certification Action Taken: None.

Comments of Investigator: There is no explanation for the reported sighting by the observers. They are very certain of what they saw, but it does not appear to have been any known object or phenomena. The object remained visible for a considerable period of time and was observed by more than one person, but no physical trace could be found. The case remains unidentified for lack of positive information.

The image contains a diagram illustrating the movement of two objects. The diagram shows the sun at the center, with an arrow indicating the "Direction of Travel". Two objects, labeled "Object #1" and "Object #2", are shown moving in different directions. The text below the diagram states "TAIL ON OBJECT #2 DURING FAST MOVEMENT".
