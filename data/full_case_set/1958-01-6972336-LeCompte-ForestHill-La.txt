Venus--So Bright--Causing Quit a Stir

"THE HERALD SAYS: THIS PAGE FROM THE "BLUE BOOK" SHOWS A REPORT ON WHEN VENUS WAS MISTAKEN FOR A UFO. IT WAS VISIBLE AROUND 7:30 P.M. LAST NIGHT AND CAUSED QUITE A STIR AS PEOPLE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A UFO. OFFICIALS FROM HEADQUARTERS AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON WERE CALLED IN TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT. THEY DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MERELY VENUS AND CALMED THE EXCITEMENT."

ASTRONOMY
Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be missed in evening observations.
By JAMES STOKLEY
THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the western sky after sunset these evenings is the planet Venus, shining with a brilliancy and clarity of outline reminiscent of a beacon.
Venus is now at a point in its cycle when it becomes most prominent to earthly observers. It is still rather low in the sky, but it is brighter at the present time than at any other season of the year.
In November, Venus will be visible in the eastern sky before sunrise.
Bright Birds in the Sky
There may be, however, some who mistakenly identify the stars instead of Venus as the bright object in the evening sky. At this season of the year, perhaps more than at any other, the appearance of Venus in the evening sky closely resembles that of a bright star.
The reason is, of course, that Venus appears brightest when it is seen close to the horizon, just after sunset or before sunrise.
At such times, the blue and violet rays in the light of Venus are scattered more by the atmosphere, and only the yellow, orange and red rays come through, giving Venus the star-like appearance.
This brilliant planet which we see in the evening now will disappear from view in November, when it will reappear in the morning sky.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNIT D.THTLD FLYING OBJECTS
CASE NO. 1201-53 
LOCATION: FOREST HILL. LOUISIANA
DATE OF REPORT: 3 JANUARY 1958

SUMMARY: This report describes the observation of an unidentified flying object by Mrs. WILLIAM H. CLEMENT, AG 39-56560, and Mrs. JOSEPH OSCHWALD, AG 39-56561, both residents of LEESVILLE (33709), LOUISIANA. They were both in a car driving on Louisiana Highway 112 between LECOMPTE (39516N 92210ÿ) and FOREST HILL 
(3IO600N 920312ÿ), LOUISIANA, and on Highway 28 between FOREST HILL and NATCHEZ (310600N 920312W), LOUISIANA. Observations were made on the evening of 3 JANUARY 1958 commencing at approximately 1920 hours and lasting to approximately 1950 hours.

Both sources are college graduates and school teachers at LEESVILLE and are prominent and considered to be reputable citizens. Their husbands are successful businessmen in LEESVILLE, LOUISIANA. Sources were very cooperative in all instances and supplied their information freely with one reservation; that the interviewers use the utmost discretion in processing the information they were to give. They were interviewed separately and then it was decided to combine their information into one report.

The report describes the observation of an unidentified object by two individuals on Louisiana Highway 112 between LeCompte and Forrest Hill, Louisiana on January 3, 1958. The report includes details about the size, shape, and appearance of the observed object, as well as the direction of travel and observations made by the witnesses. However, there does not appear to be any photograph included in this particular page.

d. Object moved gracefully with no abrupt movement in ascent or descent. Sources referred to it as "gliding" in all its movements. Object remained predominantly on left side of car while the car moved in a westerly direction. At one point on Highway 28, beyond FOREST HILL, it was traveling toward MINDEN, (exact spot unknown), the object appeared to have stopped in front of the car but when the sources arrived at the spot they thought it to be, it was not there. According to Mrs. LECOMPTE it reappeared to the left of the car in its usual general location.
e. The object last disappeared approximately three (3) miles EAST of MINDEN, LOUISIANA, (exact distance undetermined). It was not observed again by either source. Mrs. LECOMPTE said the object was out of sight while traveling NORTH from FOREST HILL to Louisiana Highway 28 and then re-appeared to her left when she turned WEST on Highway 28. However, she stated that the object was observed by her to the rear of the car while traveling this three (3) mile stretch of road.

Sources of this report were contacted separately and each was convinced that she had observed an un-identified object. It was obvious that Mrs.___ was more concerned and frightened by what she had observed than was Mrs.___ (2) occasions began to turn around once or few miles WEST OF LECOMPTE and again a few miles out of FOREST HILL. Mrs.___ stated that she did not do so because she thought if the object was going to intercept with them it could do so at the option, therefore she could see no logical reason for turning around. To compensate for this Mrs.___ said she advanced her speed to approximately 70 MPH in order to get home as soon as possible. Mrs.___ stated that the interior lights of the car were off or dimmed during the entire escapade. Mrs.___ and her seven (7) year old girl in the back seat, together with Mrs.___ one and one-half (1 1/2) year old child. Both women stated they tried to with-hold their concern and fright from the children and thought they had succeeded. It was determined by the interview that neither child had seen the object. Both sources first thought that the object was a light which they would subsequently be able to identify. However, after passing several lights and radio towers along the road they realized that their thinking had been wrong. Mrs.___ said that only one car passed them during the observation, it was going the opposite direction. One other car followed them a short distance but turned off the road. No other vehicles were observed by them during the observation. Mrs.___ had traveled this road many times on the way to BATON ROUGE.

LOUISIANA and reportedly has never made any observation of this nature before. The car used belonged to Mr. LeCompte. It was a 1957 CHEVROLET. It was checked for possible leads as to the cause of the observations. It possessed no exterior or interior objects which might account for the sightings. The road taken by the sources during their observations was re-traveled by the preparing officer during the same evening period in attempt to seek an explanation for what they had observed. The only observation which could be considered related to the un-identified object was the PLANET VENUS. It was located in the same general vicinity as the reported object and disappeared from view at about the same time as the object reported by the sources. VENUS was bright and gave off a glow similar to that described by the sources. However, the movements of the object observed by the sources cannot be explained or accounted for. Civic officials at MELTON, FOREST HILL and LeCOMPTE were contacted in regards to observations of this nature in the past. All gave negative reports. Some could give a possible explanation for the sighting. It is believed by the preparing officer that the object in question was the PLANET VENUS and that the imagination of the sources along with the movement of this vehicle in which they were traveling made it appear as if VENUS was gliding gracefully from one side of them to the other.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The names of the sources of this report should not be disseminated to any civilian agency without the approval of the preparing officer.
2. Every attempt was made to identify the size and shape of objects as outlined in AFR 200-2, but to no avail. For this reason it is believed that neither source could make a satisfactory estimate of size and shape of objects.

3. Sources estimated that they traveled at the speed of 60-70 MPH for approximately three (3) minutes from the spot of observation to the spot where they thought the object should have been.

4. A Maj______ of the Army CIC located at FORT POLK, LOUISIANA spoke very highly of the sources and their families. He knew them personally and regarded them above reproach and not likely to "cook up" the incident outlined in this report.

5. The time lag between time of observation (3 Jan) and the date of this report (13 Jan) was due to the preparing officer not receiving a report of the incident until 8 January 1958.
