The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and a "B" marked on it, along with a drawing of an object in the sky. The second sketch shows a larger perspective sketch with an "A" and "B" marking the positions of the object, as well as a smaller inset sketch.

Producing the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may report information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size may be attached if more space is needed.

NAME: [REDACTED]
SIGNATURE: [REDACTED] 
DATE: 3 MARCH 1956

The handwritten description states that at 16:30, a bright light was observed over Spokane, Washington. The light appeared to be bluish-white in color and was seen by several witnesses. The light hovered motionless for approximately 5 minutes and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared in a north-northeast direction. The witnesses estimated the object's size to be about 25 to 30 feet in diameter and its altitude to be around 2,500 to 3,000 feet. The text also mentions that the observers were interviewed and could not identify the object as any known aircraft.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten report or document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text in the document is as follows:

"Not on the report made up this morning for the newspapers and radio. The man at the airbase said this was on the report, but it wasn't. It seems this aircraft made a turn away from the airbase and that there were two craft together for about 10 minutes, and then one of them split off and went in a different direction. I want to get the facts as accurate as possible, as I don't want to get anything confused. I have 5 or 6 signed reports on this sighting. It happened at 11:35 pm and from the description it was quite an unusual sighting. I will know more about it as soon as I can talk to the man who phoned this in. I believe this was recorded on the radar at the airbase, but I don't have confirmation of that yet. The same general description."
