SPRING - 1952 - HASSELBACH. SAXONIA

I WAS RIDING HOME ON..... MOTOR IN...HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FRONT OF HOUSE LOOKING AT THE SKY, JUST AS I WAS RIDING HOME ON MY BICYCLE, WHEN I REACHED THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE OF HASSELBACH: SOMETHING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YARDS AWAY, AT FIRST SIGHT, IT APPEARED TO BE A PILE OF METALLIC SEEMING OBJECTS. AS I APPROACHED THIS, IT WAS NOW ABOUT SIXTY YARDS FROM IT. IMPRESSION HAD BEEN INCORPORATED - THE THING 9 APPEARED TO BE RESTING ON THE GROUND. THE CASING CAME UP IN A SORT OF A DOME SHAPE AND SEEMED TO BE MADE OF A SHINY, METALLIC SUBSTANCE, AND WAS WARM TO THE TOUCH. I SAW THAT IT WAS NOW ABOUT THIRTY YARDS FROM ME. THERE WAS A RING OF A BLACK CYLINDRICAL SEEMING TOWER ABOUT TEN CENTIMETERS IN HEIGHT AROUND THE EDGE. TWO ROWS OF HOLES ALONG THE SIDES, ABOUT A FOOT IN DIAMETER. SUDDENLY ABOUT TEN CM OF THE METALLIC OBJECT ROSE UP OUT OF THE HOLES IN THE CYLINDRICAL TOWER, COMING TOWARDS ME. I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS VIBRATING. IT THEN SANK BACK DOWN INTO THE TOWER. SUDDENLY IT ROSE UP AGAIN HIGHER AND I SAW THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP FLASHED ON AND OFF AT REGULAR INTERVALS. IT REMAINED VIBRATING AND REMAINED STEADILY IN THAT POSITION, AT WHICH TIME I HEARD A WHISTLING SOUND, RATHER LIKE THE NOISE MADE BY A GROWING AWAY OF STEAM. NOW THE COLOR CHANGED TO RED, THEN CHANGED TO GREEN, THEN CHANGED TO WHITE. AT TIMES IT SEEMED TO BE GLOWING. IT THEN ROSE SLOWLY FROM THE GROUND. I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GLOWING EXHAUST WAS PROPELLING IT UPWARDS FROM THE GROUND. IT SEEMED TO BE RESTING ON THE CYLINDRICAL PIECE WHICH HAD SUNK THROUGH THE CENTER. SUDDENLY THE WHOLE THING THAT WAS GLOWING OUTSIDE ROSE UP OFF THE WARMING PAN WITH ITS GLOWING OUTSIDE RING OF FLAME. WAS NOW SOME FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. I COULD SEE THAT THE WHOLE OF THE INSIDE OF THE CYLINDER ON WHICH IT HAD RESTED HAD NOW DISAPPEARED INSIDE THE CENTER AND SEEMED TO BE GLOWING INSIDE ITSELF. SUDDENLY IT SHOT UP AT TERRIFIC SPEED AND DISAPPEARED OVER HILLS IN THE DISTANCE, DAUGHTER AND I HEARD A WHISTLING SOUND, RATHER LIKE THE NOISE MADE BY A GROWING AWAY OF STEAM OR AIR. IT WAS STILL GAINING HEIGHT OVER THE HILLS AND DISAPPEARED. SOMETHING WHICH THEY TOOK FOR A COMET? ONE, SHOULDERS BROAD. HE LOOKED TO ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY YEARS OF AGE. HE WAS BOUNDING OFF UNWARRANTEDLY INTO THE WOODS.

SAWMILL WATCHMAN TOLD THEM HE HAD SEEN WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A "SLOW FLYING OBJECT" ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE, WHICH HAD MOVED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND OR AIR DISTURBANCE, AND THAT HIS DAUGHTER AND HE HAD DREAMED THE WHOLE EPISODE. IT WAS NOT FOR ONE MINUTE THAT I BELIEVED THAT MY DAUGHTER AND I HAD BEEN DREAMING. I REALIZED THEN THAT THE THING HAD GONE. I WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD BEEN STANDING. I FOUND A CIRCULAR DEPRESSION, EVIDENTLY FRESHLY MADE, WHERE THE EARTH HAD BEEN STANDING. I REALIZED THEN THAT I HAD NOT BEEN DREAMING.

Luminous flying object over Iran
There have been many sightings reported of unknown objects observed on the Soviet-Iranian border and the following represents a cross-cut of the sighting:

15 Mar 52 Description: Luminous object 3 meters long moving with extraordinary speed appeared and disappeared 30 to 40 times after 2000 hours. (Comment: It is unlikely that this was caused by meteors)

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

30 March 1952
Braintree, Massachusetts

HAVE YOU HEARD

By Bill Schofield

This is barrage day in the flying saucer department, and you're getting two stories for the price of one—the first from a resident of western Massachusetts, and the second one for what's it worth.

Occasionally I don't give any stories but just print what people believe to be true. In the past few years many people believe they have seen flying saucers, or have seen some form of unexplained phenomena that they describe as flying saucers. We continue to receive them and catalogue them and print the most significant of them, in the hope that sometime, somehow, someone may be able to give us an actual explanation of all the weird things that have been going on in the skies during the past five years. So far, nobody has been able to do this.

When and if they do, it will be one of the biggest discoveries of all time. Meanwhile, those who see these things keep on claiming they really saw them, and it does give one pause.

This story is told by Charles E. Earley, a 37-year-old gas and oil worker, who was returned half out of his skins on the afternoon of March 20 from a visit from a pair of flying rings.

It appears that Mr. Earley, was driving home, when he saw two circular, saucerlike objects over the dark, wooded countryside surrounding Greenfield. He stopped his car to get a better look, and the two objects seemed to be just hovering there without any sound.

He looked up, and saw this thing "coming down," as he put it. It was a little smaller than the moon, and it came down close to his car, about 75 feet up, and hovered there.

"I looked up, and saw this thing coming down," he says. "At first I thought it was an airplane, but when it got closer I could see it was something else. It was round and flat, and there wasn't any noise from it at all. It just hovered there, about 75 feet up, right over my car."

The object, he says, seemed to be made of a polished metal, and it reflected moonlight. There were no lights on it that he could see. For two or three minutes it hung there, and then it suddenly shot up and away at a terrific speed, going straight up until it disappeared from sight.

Mr. Earley, who is a sober, hard-working man, said he was so shaken up by the experience that he could hardly drive home. "I couldn't believe my own eyes," he said. "I've heard about these things, but I never thought I'd see one with my own eyes. There's no doubt in my mind that what I saw was real. It wasn't any airplane or anything like that—it was something else. I guess I'll never know what it was, but I know I saw it."

This time the story is told by Charles T. Earley, a 37-year-old gas and oil worker, who was shaken half out of his skins on the afternoon of March 20 from a visit from a pair of flying rings.
