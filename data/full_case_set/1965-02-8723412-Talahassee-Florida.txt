WODC-BO
Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Report

TO: Foreign Technology Division (FTD) 
    Wright-Patterson AFB, OHIO 45433

1. A follow-up investigation was conducted at 0100Z to 0500Z hours, 10 Feb 65, at Florida State University, Tallahassee, Fla. Prior to the designated time, the Dean of Students at FSU, a Mr. Arnold, was contacted for assistance in arranging for the presence of all known and available witnesses. In fact, inspection of documents revealed that on the very day the incident occurred, a prominent notice in the college newspaper notifying the students of the time and place of the proposed interviews and urging personnel who were stations informed the public via spot news bulletins that Air Force investigators were in the area and desired to interview all individuals who could furnish information about the UFO.

2. In spite of this publicity means of notification, only one student, Mr. -- appeared for interview. His testimony appeared to be sincere and reliable; his description of the UFO was that of the classic "flying saucer" as depicted in movies. Another allegedly detailed sighting by one of two co-eds (who observed the UFO from a dormitory window but consented only two blocks from the ballroom), but consented to furnish the requested information via telephone. Her description appeared reasonably sincere and convincing. I would be inclined to place less credence in her story than in Mr. --'s.

3. Attempts were made to contact other witnesses listed in the original message. One source contained a fraudulent address and telephone number. Another was at work and his mother advised he would be home shortly and she would send him over to be interviewed; but that individual did not put in an appearance. All other efforts to locate witnesses and secure statements were unsuccessful.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed page from a UFO report document.

In view of the very limited response to our requests for information, one receives the definite impression that the anonymous sightings and encounters which gave rise to these statements were a good possibility that the entire incident was a hoax of some sort. Otherwise, it seems likely that more witnesses would have come forward with information which could have aided in the investigation.

5. Because both witnesses who were contacted stated that the sightings were carefully investigated by Eastern Air Lines and the Tower Operator at Jacksonville, PIA, cannot be completely discarded. However, there is at this time, no compelling evidence linking the sightings to the UTO alleged in the Tallahassee area.

6. Tyndall and Eglin AFB's reported negative activity of any type on or near the vicinity of Tallahassee, FLA, at the time of the UTO sighting.

7. This evidence thus far is deemed very unsatisfactory, vague, and inconclusive. In the absence of subpoena powers, it would appear that further attempts to secure statements from alleged witnesses would not justify the manhours and expenses involved. It is felt that further identification would be pure conjecture, and would be of no probative value. Therefore, it is recommended that this investigation be closed.

The initial report indicates that the pilot of Eastern Airlines Flight 704 observed this object over Daytona Beach, Florida. We would appreciate it if you could have the pilot and/or other crew members who were on board furnish us with any additional information they may have regarding this incident.
Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

This will acknowledge your letter of March 8, 1965, received in this office on March 15, 1965, in regard to your letter of February 1, 1965, concerning an unidentified flying object, reported on the night of February 1, 1965, in the Tallahassee, Tallahassee area.

We have contacted the crew of our flight (2H) and they state they were not cognizant of any such flying object. EAL trip 2H continues to be an unidentified flying object.

It is our belief that you must have been given the wrong EAL trip. 

I am sorry we were unable to help in this instance. If there is anything further we can do, please advise.

Very truly yours,

M/R: 3 FEB 65 

At 1500, 3 Feb 65 Major Jacks called Sgt Jones and wanted to know if we received a message from Tyndall AFB, Florida relating to a UFO sighting over Jacksonville and I said no, he told me to call Tyndall to find out what it was or what action they were taking on it. 

At 1510 I called Tyndall and the Operations said they sent it to the Command Post, in turn. I called Command Post and they said they sent it to 100-2 Section at Gunther. Called 100-2 section and spoke to a sergeant there who said they would find out all information about this sighting and call us back. When talking with 100-2, Major Jacks office called and wanted to know what I had found out. Told them Tyndall sent it on to 100-2 without taking any action. She said to call them back and tell them that in accordance with AFR 200-2 they are responsible for the investigation.

At 615 recalled Tyndall and spoke to Capt Harnburger who said to call the Commander of the Command Post, he transferred my call to that office. Spoke with Lt Col Robinson, he said they were trying to get up to the Commander to see if he wanted to make the investigation or not, and he would think about it. I replied to him that Major Jacks office wants to know what action was being taken on it before closing time. He said he would call Maj Jacks himself. I then called SAFOI and told Sarn that the Colonel was going to call her before quitting time.

At 1625 NORAD called me back and Capt Whitman from NORAD (33rd Region) read the message to me which had been sent to them from Tyndall. Whitman said he didn't deal with it when it was there responsibility to take the action since Tyndall sent them the message and about 9 other stations received it before them. Whitman said that on the same day that they received the message they informed Tyndall that Tyndall should make the investigation. I (Sgt Jones) do not know what Tyndall's action was.

The text in the document reads as follows:

reply was. Sgt Whittman did not know who had told Tyndall that they were to take the action but he had heard from 3 others that someone had told Tyndall to take the action. Sgt Jones told Whittman that it wasn't his responsibility and we would get Tyndall to send us a copy of the message.

In January 1956, Sgt Brown reported that an object was observed by an unknown observer in Florida. The report would be published in priority message by Capt Tindall.
