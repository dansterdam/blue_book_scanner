Location 20 miles S. of Battle Creek, Michigan
Date 20 June 1960 Hour (2) 2130Z
Wx High scattered clouds, vis 15Z, winds westerly at 15 to 20 knots
Description Box shaped, size of pencil eraser, silvery-reflective, three objects in line formation approx 2 miles apart, first seen 50 deg elev, last seen 30 to 35 deg elev, moved at very slow rate of speed in a straight and level path, seen for about 5 minutes
Direction of Motion South

SPECIAL REPORT

DATE: 7 June 1960

SUBJECT: UNSATISFACTORY CONDITION OF FILM RECOVERED AT BATTLE CREEK, MICHIGAN ON 7 JUNE 1960

1. On 7 June 1960, this office received a roll of 35mm film from the Command Post, Tactical Air Command, at Battle Creek, Michigan. The film was recovered from the site of an aircraft accident which occurred approximately 20 miles south of Battle Creek, Michigan on the evening of 6 June 1960.

2. Upon receipt, the film was delivered to the OSI Photo Laboratory for processing and evaluation. The following observations were made:

a. The film was found to be in an unsatisfactory condition for purposes of interpretation or further evaluation. Extensive heat damage and physical distortion of the film base and emulsion had occurred, rendering the images completely unidentifiable.

b. No discernible images could be detected on the processed film by visual or photographic means.

3. The damaged film has been retained in the OSI Photo Laboratory for a period of 30 days, pending further instructions. No additional action is contemplated at this time.

TEXT OUTPUT:
20 MILES SOUTH OF BATTLE CREEK, MICHIGAN 
REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
I. SUMMARY
On 7 June 1960, at approximately 2330 hours, two security policemen stationed at Kellogg Air Force Base, Battle Creek, Michigan, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky approximately 20 miles south of Battle Creek. The object was described as round or elliptical in shape, giving off a pulsating red glow and giving the appearance of spinning. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before disappearing from view.
II. DETAILS
On 7 June 1960, at approximately 2330 hours, two security policemen, A1C [REDACTED] and A1C [REDACTED], were conducting a routine security patrol approximately 20 miles south of Battle Creek, Michigan, on Interstate Highway 94 when they observed an unidentified flying object in the sky.
The object was described as round or elliptical in shape, approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and giving off a pulsating red glow. The object appeared to be slowly rotating or spinning as it hovered silently in the sky.
The two airmen observed the object for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before it suddenly disappeared from view, appearing to simply blink out. No sound was heard emanating from the object, and there were no other witnesses to the incident.
III. CONCLUSION
The unidentified flying object observed by the two security policemen near Battle Creek, Michigan, on 7 June 1960 remains unexplained. No known aircraft or celestial phenomenon can be definitively associated with the object described in this report. The object's shape, color, and behavior are not consistent with any conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon currently known. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the nature and origin of this unidentified flying object.

The image does not contain a photograph. The page appears to be a typed document with text describing the examination of an 8mm film strip that was found. There is no visual information or photograph present in this image.

The text in the document states:

The 8mm strip was examined as closely as possible, and all that could be seen was and oblong orange light. There was no detail whatever, and the image was so small,that even when enlarged several times it was impossible to identify the image.
