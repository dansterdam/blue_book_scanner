35. When did you report to some official that you had seen the object?
______Day ___________Month _____1959____Year

36. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Circle One) Yes No

36.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One) Yes No

36.2 Please list their names and addresses:
As I don't believe it would have been possible to get the others, and also because I don't know the correct direction where I was looking. I would also hesitate to mention anyone by name without their permission.

37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this?
(Circle One) Yes No

37.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?
On Dec. 13, 1954 at 7:25 p.m. (CST) I saw a group of 5 or 6 objects silently traveling east to west, quite a distance from my home. They seemed to be about two blocks from my home. It was traveling east with perhaps a tendency towards the southeast.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
That it was some kind of unmanned flying device, a test model perhaps, or an optical illusion of some sort. As I said in my letter, it would not have been a guess. As I wrote, I have never claimed to have observed a "flying saucer" and I wouldn't want to foster that guess. It was rather an attempt to be helpful in supplying information that might be of value to those engaged in the investigation. I hope the enclosed information will be helpful.

The letter is dated July 30, 1959 and acknowledges the recipient's letter dated July 9, 1959 regarding an unidentified flying object sighting on July 3, 1959. The letter states that the recipient's letter contained insufficient data to allow a valid conclusion, and requests the recipient to complete the inclosed Air Force questionnaire and forward the completed paper to the Air Force Technical Information Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio for analysis and study.

Project Blue Book 
Writer: Emerson AFB
Date: 29 July 1959

Gentlemen:

Enclosed is a report of an unidentified flying object which I saw on 23 July 1959. A copy has been sent to both NICAP(in Washington, D.C.) and AFSC(in Charleston, S.C.).

In paragraph #5 I said the object could not have been a conventional aircraft/satellite. The only known object it might have been is an "internal reflection" of artificial light. It was that, I don't think.

I checked today with the four Chicago newspapers. None had a UFO report for that date.

Would you please acknowledge this report? Also, I would like to know any conclusions you may come to and what prompted these conclusions.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch depicts a curved horizon line with an object or phenomenon above it, as described in the instructions. The smaller sketch on the right shows a scenic landscape with a person standing in the foreground.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
