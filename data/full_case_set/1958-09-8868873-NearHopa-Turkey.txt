The document describes an incident on 16 September 1958, where a USAF officer observed unidentified flying objects or projections from the deck of a US ship near the USSR/Turkey border, while searchlights were being used in the area. The objects were observed for approximately 25 minutes and estimated to be at an elevation of around 300 feet. The weather was clear, and no other objects were observed until 2315 hours, at which time some objects were seen again at 2350 hours.

CONFIDENTIAL

The objects were visible for approximately four seconds. There were no fireworks displayed at Fourth of July celebrations. No other objects were observed until 2315 hours, and only one object was seen again at 2350 hours.

All observations were unrestricted as they were made over water. The weather was clear, and the searchlights were being directed inland to observe the objects. The COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICERS section indicates that this is the seventh report of this type submitted since 5 July 1958.
