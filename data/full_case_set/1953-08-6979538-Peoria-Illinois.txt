                                UNCLASSIFIED

17 August 1953                    Peoria, Illinois

Description

Two civilian observes at different locations in Peoria saw an un-
identified flying object at 1445 CST 17 August 1953. The object appeared
the size of a baseball with a very brilliant white color. No trail or
exhaust was observed and the object seemed to be suspended in the air
and then slowly moved away. The speed of the object was unknown. The
object was observed south of Peoria and moved off south-southeast. At
the time of this sighting, personnel of the 791st AC&W Squadron, Hanna
City, Illinois, observed a half-moon shaped object in the same vicinity.
Total time of observation was 30 minutes.

Discussion

The AC&W Squadron at Hanna City did not pick up any unusual tracks
on radar in the area mentioned. Checks with local weather station for
possible release determined that there were no weather balloons in the
area. Checks made with airfields in the vicinity precluded that there
were no aircraft in the area. Check with upper air balloon tracks re-
veal that there was an upper air research balloon over Peoria at the
time of sighting.

Conclusion

Was balloon.
