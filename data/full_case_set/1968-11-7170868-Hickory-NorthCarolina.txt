The size is about the same as the sun. It would not stay still, but rather would dart back and forth and up and down. It was either bluish-white or reddish-orange in color. It seemed to be giving off its own light rather than reflecting light. After about 5 minutes, it went out of sight. I could not determine how far away it was.

Transcription of the text in the document:

It could have been a new type of aircraft which was seen on the north side of the city. The witnesses stated that it hovered for a few minutes, then accelerated and disappeared. The object was said to be circular in shape, silver in color, and about the size of a small car. It was observed at an altitude of approximately 500 feet. The witnesses were unable to determine any specific details regarding its construction or means of propulsion. It was reported to have made no sound during its flight. The report was made to the local police department and then forwarded to the proper authorities for further investigation.

[Handwritten text] The observed object appeared to be dark or dark colored, approximately 80-100 feet in diameter. It was at an estimated altitude of 2000-2500 feet and seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. At times it appeared to be partly obscured by the cloud cover. I had the impression that it was a craft of some kind. Its outline was not sharply defined, but rather had a hazy or indistinct appearance. I observed it until it disappeared or merged with the clouds and could no longer be seen. The sighting lasted approx. 3-5 minutes. There were no unusual sounds associated with the object and no apparent means of propulsion was visible.
