TEXT OUTPUT:
One morning when we arrived at work we found a small circular object hovering in the air about a half mile away. At first it appeared to be a small plane or helicopter in the distance but as it came closer we saw that it was something quite different. It was circular in shape, about 20 feet in diameter and silvery in color. It had no wings, rudder, propellor or visible means of propulsion. Moving silently and effortlessly, it slowed down as it approached and then hovered for a few minutes over the nearby swamp area. We watched in amazement as the strange object turned this way and that, first hovering motionless and then darting here and there. It appeared to be under intelligent control. After a few minutes it suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed and was lost to sight in seconds. The incident was witnessed by three of us, all reliable and respectable citizens in the community. I am quite certain that what we saw was not any known type of aircraft. It was clearly an unidentified flying object.
