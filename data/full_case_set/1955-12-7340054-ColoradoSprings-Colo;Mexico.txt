The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073, describing an observation that occurred on December 13, 1955 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, near Mexico. The observer reported seeing an object moving in a direction towards the east, with a white color at the forward end and a blueish trail or tail. The object flew a straight course, flat trajectory. The "Conclusions" section indicates the object was likely an "Astro (Meteor)".
