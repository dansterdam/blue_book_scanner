DATE: JANUARY 8, 1960

Referring to the date of my previous report on the month of OCTOBER 20, 1959 I went to East on a business trip and while traveling on Highway 99 at about 7:30 PM at a point about 10 miles north of Bothell, Washington, I observed a brilliant object in the sky which riveted my attention. It appeared to be circular in shape and was without any markings or lights and was of a brilliant silver color reflecting the light of the sky. Its size appeared to be about 3 times the size of a normal 4 engine jet. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then suddenly disappeared without any sound. I request no publicity in this matter as I have no desire to become involved in this subject more than is necessary.

AGENCY CASE REPORT

(Case No. 10242, 2 November 1956).

On 12 November 1956, an unidentified flying object was observed from 8:00 P.M. to 9:30 P.M. over Bothell, Washington.

Senator Jackson was notified. Inquiries at the time revealed that the necessary action was taken by the proper military organizations. A copy of the report was forwarded to this office for analysis.

The temporary file shows that the object was reported to be a luminous, flashing, white object at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet. It was described as being circular in shape, 20-30 feet in diameter and moved in a northwesterly direction at a velocity of about 60 miles per hour.

It is reported that some effort was made to investigate this case. However, since the object was not photographed and no physical evidence was found, the case remains unresolved.

In view of the reported nature of the sighting, it is requested that the report be reviewed and forwarded to the Public Information Office for possible release.

It is requested that the answers to the following questions be provided:

1. What was the shape and size of the window(s)?
2. What is the approximate height of the window(s)?
3. What is the approximate vertical length of the window(s)?
4. How far away were you from the window when you saw the object?
5. Did you move closer to the window while viewing the object?
6. Was the window covered by any other materials?
7. Are there any trees, buildings or other objects in your kitchen window?
8. Please describe in detail what you saw, what the object came close to, what color(s), how it moved, and any other details that you can remember.

I was awakening you with the following information. You will find it very interesting in connection with the attached case.

CASE SUMMARY: JRCOMANN

I am reporting you with the following case which has just come to the attention of this office.

LAST LIGHT ON EVENING OF Nov. 8, 1960 
BOTHELL, WASHINGTON 
...
Approximate direction of object was westerly, approximately one thousand five hundred yards and at an estimated altitude of approximately two thousand feet.
I was unable to see any details of the object due to the poor lighting conditions. The only thing I could ascertain was the presence of a rotating or revolving light which appeared to be very brilliant in nature. The light remained on for approximately 15 minutes, at which time it seemed to wink out and disappear completely. No other lights were observed once the main light disappeared. The night was very cloudy and overcast, so the background was quite dark.
I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately thirty to forty feet in length. The pattern of the light gave the impression of a rotating or revolving action rather than a steady beam or glow.
I am and was completely convinced that what I observed last evening was a completely unidentified flying object. This is the first incident of this nature I have ever encountered, and I am at a loss to even speculate as to the identity or origin of the object observed.
I would appreciate any information or comments your office may have concerning this incident. I am most anxious to learn if there have been any other similar reports from this area, and if so, what conclusions if any have been drawn.
