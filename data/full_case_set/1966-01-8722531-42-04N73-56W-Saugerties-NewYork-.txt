The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page. The text on the page appears to be a written report describing the sighting of a UFO by two patrolmen, including details about the physical evidence and the involvement of the New York State Police. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

K.: Position, Title and Comments of Preparing Officer:

Ext: Thomas S. Waller 
Navy EMO
4213th Def Sys Eval Sq
Stewart Air Force Base, New York

I believe that the UFO seen by these people may have been a phenomenon associated with the temperature inversion. New York State Police confirmed the sighting - 2 patrolmen saw the object.

L. Physical Evidence: Possibly one photograph which has not yet been developed will forward same if it turns out.
