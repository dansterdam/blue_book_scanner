TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

26/944 - Dividend called and asked if we had any more information. Gov't also called.
26/13032 - 64th Intell called for information on Aircraft Flash from 11:00 - 00:50.
26/13132 - Called Mr. [REDACTED] for more information.
26/13252 - Dividend called enquiring about how serious the situation was.
...
3. Since 72 GCOS had received no enquiries from 64th, Intell appeared to be satisfied for the present. The Detachment Commander telephoned Capt. Rouse of the 72 Fighter Interceptor Squadron, asking if he had reported anything to 64th Intell. Capt. Rouse said that his men had observed nothing unusual...
4. At 26/1130Z it was learned that a party consisting of RCMP and Fishery personnel had gone to Glenwood during the night and questioned Johnson, but no action had been made. Weather prevented them from starting their trip on this date. 
5. At the request of Lt. Cooper, 64th Intelligence, the RCPO RCMP party went out on the ground search at 27/1130Z. The party left Glenwood at 27/1320Z without finding anything.... The party returned to the clearing he claimed he had found on 26 555 33.
...
6. The Detachment Commander interviewed two officials of the Gander Weather Office and established that the data contained on the Teletypes and telphones gave no indication of a reported sighting from the Gander Weather Office or Airport Control Tower. The officials interviewed stated that they had no further information to add, that they had instructed all personnel to report any unusual sightings immediately, and that so far they had received no such reports from the lookout posts manned by airport personnel. His assurance that no such information had been forwarded from the Gander Weather Office or Control Tower was confirmed by telephone to 64th Intell.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, containing text describing sightings of unidentified flying objects.

Further questioning of Flying Officer Miller on the sighting at 25/4/102 revealed that, in his opinion, the object was definitely a bright star. The object was sighted as being south-east of GANDER, Newfoundland at about that time. It makes it appear that Seybrrow had four unidentified plots at about that time on an object.

The report describes two different sightings, the first at 25/4/102 and the second at 26/4/102. The second sighting occurred in the vicinity of Glenwood, Newfoundland, where an operating detachment of RCAF Camp. A glow was observed in the sky and was identified by sol as something strange, but the clearing presumably occurred and the object was gone. The officials did not know if it had made such a clearing.

The report discusses the clearing with freshly broken and uprooted trees, which was used to guide the ground party back to the camp. It states that this could be due to the lack of knowledge of the area. The report recommends a low level search using infrared photos, as it is believed the clearing could have been caused by snow and bush conditions existing in the area. Further, the fact that Seybrrow had four unidentified plots at a height of 2000 feet about the time of the sighting is noted.

A map, scale 1:250,000, is included as "App 'B'" and shows the route of the search party and the route presumably taken by the sighting.

The report concludes by advising the Detachment Commander be advised of any further information required by the 72 ROAD Ground Observer Corps Detachment.

At 12:40 A.M., 25 February 1958, a call was received from Mr. [redacted], Glenwood, Newfoundland. He reported the sighting of a disc-like object falling from the sky and on fire.

Later during the day Mr. [redacted] called and stated he had visited the area where the object had touched landed and found a clearing 1/4 mile by 1000 feet, irregularly broken and showing signs of having been cleared away in a perfect triangle. The snow was depressed and plowed up at one end. There were no signs of heat or tracks. He also stated that a Mrs. [redacted] and her daughter of Glenwood had seen a long, red streak in the sky East of Glenwood at 12:00 midnight.

Mrs. [redacted] was not available for interview, but her daughter, Miss [redacted], was questioned concerning their sighting. She described the object as a red light in the East traveling toward Gander. A check disclosed the light was seen in the vicinity of the Trans-Canada Highway. There was a snowplow clearing the roads after two days of heavy snowfall, and it is very possible this is what they saw.

While investigating Mr. [redacted]'s sighting, a call came in from Flight Officer [redacted], Duty Controller of the 226th aircraft control and Warning Squadron, at Gander, XXX Newfoundland. He and two other men saw an object on their radar scope on a very erratic course. It disappeared from the scope to the West and they went outside to see if there was anything in the area. Upon further questioning, Flight Officer [redacted] revealed that, in his opinion, this object was definitely a bright star which appeared to change colors due to the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a report or document. The text in the document is as follows:

At 10:45 A.M., 27 February 1958, a ground party left Glenwood with Mr. [REDACTED] to locate the clearing he claimed to have found, with no success.

Two officials of the Bowaters Woods Department, Glenwood, who knew Mr. [REDACTED] for some time, were interviewed. It was learned that Mr. [REDACTED] has a reputation - to put it mildly - of [REDACTED]. This is borne out by the fact that during the search, he made several inquiries as to whether this incident could receive any publicity. When he was informed that it probably would not, his assurance that he could find the clearing again became less vehement.

Further search was not recommended due to the snow and brush conditions. If the clearing could be located, aerial photos could be taken and studied.

Because Mr. [REDACTED] cannot furnish more details or locate the clearing, this is carried as an unknown [REDACTED].
