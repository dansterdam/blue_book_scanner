UFO SIGHTING - DAYTON AREA, 6 MARCH 1958

1. Majority of reports state object small, round, slightly larger in size than 500 to 1000 feet. (See winds above for those altitudes at that time and place, 6 to 8 knots).

2. A. General time of sighting 6:30 to 6:50 A.M.  
   B. Checked with U.S. Weather Service, Mr. Halsey. Phones DW 8-4529. Stated winds substantially as above. Determined a little error. Check 6:30 to 6:45 A.M.

3. A report of a very reliable source follows:
   Source: M/Sgt Hurley, 6th Weather Grp. AP. Phone 3-6311
   Sighting Brief: Observed sometime between 6:00 to 6:15A.M. Moved slowly. Size in 7 minutes was 6 to 3 2. Shape and color: small, round, slight tinge of red. (Stated that this was the disappearance to early March rays) and about 1/2 elevation.

4. Astro check: Astro computer, tables, etc. reveal no astro body in that direction responsible. Could have been washed out by the dawn at 6:15.

5. Conclusions: The appearance, characteristics and movement of the object are typical of a balloon. The checks above confirm that the object was without doubt a balloon, resolved just a few minutes before reported by the general public.

"UFO Scare Here
Blamed on Venus
By OLIVER W. BROWN, JR.
DAYTON (sic) STAFF WRITER
Dayton today had its own "flying saucer" which a local scientist said was merely Venus and was not unidentified.
The object, variously described as green, yellow, red, white and blue, startled many Daytonians for a short time this morning.
This morning's phenomenon was reported by Dayton police, the State Highway Patrol and the Air Force to the control center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
A Guard at the Mound lab in Miamisburg watched it through binoculars and called it to the attention of his associates.
"It's so prominent, it looks like a search light on an airplane," he told the others. "Its now appearing for enough away from the sun that it's visible for two hours or so before sunrise."
Kenneth Kissell, a scientist, said he was observing the same object through his telescope Wednesday night and identified it as the planet Venus.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

"Flying Saucer" No Planet
Unless Venus Wears Tail

On the morning of March 6, The Daily News stated, a local expert and aviationist) mentioned that a UFO (unidentified foreign object) was spotted. Although many more sightings have occurred, this particular one was noted at approximately 7 o'clock that morning as it moved a small blinking light moving very slowly southeast from the vicinity of Dayton. GEORGE FREIBEGER.

Bad Films Are Blight
On Whole Community

A theater in Oakwood showing Class "x" movies is what is going on and the public will not take. There are others waiting to add their blight to this community if steps are not taken immediately. This blight can breed into an uncontrollable scourge unless we stop it by public demand.

New Expense Wipes Out
Cost of Living Gains

Since the first of the year, we received a threecent-an-hour increase for cost of living when I work. This is $1.20 a week or $4.80 a month.

This same week I was informed that the rent raised 50 per month. Therefore, with a raise of 50 cents, I am actually losing $1.20 a month.

How anybody say the cost of living is helping the working man? I am against it 100 per cent.

Warm Feelings After
Rescue From Ice

The members of the Fort Laramie [Fire] Department performed a courageous feat on the afternoon of Thursday, February 27, when they rescued two children from an ice-covered pond. The children had ventured too far out on the ice and were unable to free themselves.
