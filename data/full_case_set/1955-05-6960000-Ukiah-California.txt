It was under observation for about 2 minutes, during which time it performed "aerobatic-like" maneuvers, changing direction abruptly without banking or loss of altitude, then accelerating into the distance and finally disappearing from view. No further details are given which may have appeared unusually large. Insufficient data for thorough evaluation. Forwarded: 7/17/62.
