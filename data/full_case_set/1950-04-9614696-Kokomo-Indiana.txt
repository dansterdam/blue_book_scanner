1. In compliance with letter, Department of the Army, G-2,522A, dated 25 March 1948, subject: "Unconventional Aircraft," control number A-1917, the following information received from the Fifth Army is forwarded:

"On 12 April 1950, an agent interviewed Mr. [redacted], fabricator with the Continental Steel Corporation, 1200 Kokomo, Indiana. Mr. [redacted] informed agents that, upon being awakened by his dog at 2000, 8 April 1950, he observed two hundred yards or more in the sky, a lighted object, approximately fifty feet in diameter and shaped similarly to a 'flying saucer'. This object was a grayish metal disc approximately ten to fifteen feet in thickness. The object remained stationary for a few minutes and then rotated slowly on its perpendicular axis, and information was obtained that three small port holes showed a blue-white light from within. After hovering for several minutes, the object rose soundlessly and without taking off, moved away to the north at a speed approximately three times that of an aircraft. An informant could furnish no further information as to size or appearance of the operation of this apparition."

2. Since the referenced letter is more than two years old, this office desires to know if continued compliance is still requested.
