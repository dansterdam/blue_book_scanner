[Partially readable text]
...rraft was at time 12, on a cala... "orth Atlantic, flying at 2 1/6 miles [unreadable text] ...v-225c51, on a course of 170o. Object was not visible at the time or location. Aircraft first notice the object was 70 miles go rt of Juneau at a miss, Alaska. Position of the aircraft was, ...ing at an altitude of 12,000 feet and proceeding on a cruising alt. to swerve off course to avert collision. The id definitely awakened the co-pilots to view the object. [Text cut off]

Object was known be...the ball ca...t of a silv-blue-green color. There was no tail such as a me...course would have. There was no trail or emission from a jet engine. Course of object's flight did not appear to observers must have made through 150° of horizon and light objects gradually disappear from view in this same manner as a near traffic on a tar lining away. [Partially readable text]

The interrogating officer reports that both observers were experienced pilots and appeared of normal intelligence. One of the observers is a former Air Force officer and pilot. Although differing in some respects, there is a similarity between this report and a sighting of an unusual object as reported on AIC intelligence report TR-14-49 as both appear as a blue green ball and apparently traveling at a great rate of speed.
