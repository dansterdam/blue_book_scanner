TDDT/UFO (Mrs Quintanilla/Ato916/ms 13 Oct 67)
Radar Cheff 

Mr. *** Stevens Point, Wisconsin 54481

1. Reference your letter of September 13, 1967 in which you submitted an unidentified sighting. The sentry that you sent to the Aerial Phenomena Branch has been identified as radar cheff. This machine which dropped in military service is confusing radar operators as to the position of the plane. Stevens Point, Wisconsin, is a small town of Trust field.

2. We are returning your sample and also have included a copy of Project Blue Book which you may find interesting.

Sir:
Enclosed you will find samples of what appears to be bits of aluminum. It was found in a neighbor's field. This neighbor says that he thinks it fell from the sky. Why he thinks this, I don't know.
There was just one small clump of it on the material in the field. What you hold now is just a sample. Perhaps it is just some ordinary substance, and then maybe it comes from some strange place. Anyway, I'm sending it to you to examine closely.
I would appreciate it if you could tell me what the substance is. Also, could you please send me as much information as possible, concerning it.
If you are unable to tell me what the substance is, it's OK. The important thing is that you have the substance to examine.
I would appreciate any information you can offer.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
Thomas Maslowski
