SUBJECT: UFO Sighting 1 July 1968

TO: DEPT (AFDO)

1. In response to your request, I have reviewed the data concerning the UFO sighting which occurred on 1 July 1968 near New Philadelphia, Ohio.

2. The atmospheric data presented with the report does not indicate the existence of any unusual weather conditions which could explain this sighting.

3. I noted a number of inconsistencies in the report. For example, one individual reported the movement of the object in an erratic direction, while another individual indicates the object was clear.

4. In one sketch of the location, the observer depicts an underground structure could have caused a projection such as reflected light. However, the sketch in this case indicates this was clearly not the case.

5. Two sequences in the report would appear to imply at least two or three observers (as called) UFO fans. By this I am referring to the "Messerschmitt" repeated comment that he would like to help you in your investigation, and this one indicates that "everyone thinks I am cracked."

6. In summary, as far as I am personally able to determine, it was, and still remains, a UFO.

U.F.O. SIGHTINGS 
DAYTON, OHIO
DEAR SIR: 

I AM ENCLOSING THIS LETTER TO INFORM 
YOU OF MY SIGHTINGS OF A U.F.O. WHICH 
OCCURRED SOUTH EAST BETWEEN 8:40 P.M.
AND 9:05 P.M. ON JULY 2 1968.

I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE MY HOUSE WHEN 
I FIRST NOTICED THE OBJECT. IT WAS
BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR AND TRIANGULAR
IN SHAPE. IT HOVERED SILENTLY FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES THEN SHOT OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF 
SPEED TO THE SOUTH EAST AND DISAPPEARED. 

IT APPEARED AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER
AND REPEATED THE SAME MANEUVER. THIS
OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES OVER A PERIOD
OF APPROXIMATELY 25 MINUTES. THERE
WAS NO SOUND EMITTED FROM THE OBJECT
AT ANY TIME. 

I AM A FORMER SCHOOL TEACHER AND HAVE
NEVER HAD ANY EXPERIENCE WITH SUCH
PHENOMENON BEFORE. I WOULD APPRECIATE
ANY INFORMATION YOU COULD PROVIDE ME
ON THIS INCIDENT.

THANK YOU,

Dear Sir:

At about 3:15 we were going east on RR33 highway between the Minerva and Canton area and we sighted a bright light object hover about 75 yards off the ground and it appeared to be very close. We stopped the car and turned to the right and it was gone, just disappeared.

It was a bright and flying object and was a distance of about a quarter of a mile away from us.

The image appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of handwritten text.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

"haying to do any more investigating on this. Swell. Again, I am busy with too many cases at the moment to give this one the proper attention it deserves. It was not the best prepared report I've seen, but it does seem to have some merit. I'm going to have to pass this on to the next man in line, Capt. Gregory. I feel I am in over my head with the volume of UFO reports coming in these days. Something has to give. Hopefully Capt. Gregory can take a fresh look at this one and determine if it warrants any further investigation. At this point, I'm not sure what more can be done. For now, I'm going to file this one away and move on to the next case on my desk. I've given this one about as much attention as I can afford to at the moment. Time to move on."

The image contains a photograph of a document titled "Flaming Object Lights Sky, Startles Midstate Residents". The document provides a detailed account of a sighting of a "bright, moon-like object" in the sky over central Pennsylvania, witnessed by several residents. The object was described as larger than a full moon and moving at a high speed, with the document noting that the object "did not look like a satellite" and that several observers thought it might be a "lightning flash" or "falling star". The document also mentions that the sighting was reported to local authorities and newspapers. There is no text beyond the headline and the body of the report.

Flaming Object Lights Sky,
Startles Midstate Residents

A bright, moon-like object as a Central Pennsylvania resident called it, streaked across the sky Monday night startling residents of the Central Pennsylvania area. The weather bureau in nearby Harrisburg, Pa. was called but they said they had no knowledge of any special celestial events scheduled for the night.

Several residents reported seeing the object which was described as larger than a full moon and traveling at a high rate of speed. The object did not look like a satellite and several thought it might be a "lightning flash" or "falling star", but it was observed for some time and seemed to be within the Earth's atmosphere.

One Harrisburg resident, an Air Force man, said several other persons in his neighborhood also saw the object. He said it was a bluish-white color and seemed to be flaming as it went across the sky. 

Another resident said the object appeared to be slowly changing direction and would start and stop in its flight. It was described as larger than a full moon and seemed to linger for some time before going out of sight. 

The Harrisburg Police Department received several calls about the sighting and one officer said he had also observed the object from the City Hall in an effort to determine the source of the light.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document or report, with the title "Fireball Takes A Night Ride" and text describing a sighting of a meteor or fireball over the New Philadelphia, Ohio area.

IT WENT THAT WAY...
Fireball Takes
A Night Ride
Many citizens, awoke this morning to discover that not even a night's sleep would erase the members of a flaming meteor they saw through last evening's skies.
The meteor was sighted here at 9:21 p.m. and was described by residents immediately reported it to police. The brilliance of the object momentarily lighted the entire countryside and seemed larger than a planet or star. For over 10 minutes its glare was seen with a long tail much like a comet.
OBSERVERS SAY"
HUGH CAMPBELL, curator of astronomy
And planetarium director of Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, provided this information:
"Some residents of New Philadelphia reported seeing the meteor, described as a brilliant light about the size of a dinner plate, shooting across the sky in a south to north direction and then disappear or burn out. It was illuminated as if it were broad daylight."
Mrs. Doris Bole, of 500 Lancaster St., president of the Mineralogical Society of Harrisburgh, Pa., reported the object streaked across the sky moving very swiftly and disappearing in the eastern horizon in the area of Lewisbury.
THIS WAS A TYPE of meteor classified as a "Fireball" and is defined as a very intense, bright, brief light trail that emits a considerable amount of light.
THE MOST STRIKING fact about this fireball is that people were awakened this morning from their sleep to see it. This confirms the brilliance of the object, as a fireball of this magnitude would be visible even at so late an hour. Late observers said the meteor had a long tail and seemed to scatter small particles, which disappeared in the northwest.
One observer said he has been observing sky phenomena for over 25 years and has never seen anything like it before.
The meteor was said to have landed north of Millersburg Ohio police at Lewistown reported this morning they have patrolmen checking an area north of Millersburg, but so far have located nothing. The object was also sighted as far north as Waynesburg and as far north as Williamsport and Bloomsburg.
