T-5 Commanding Officer
Headquarters Squadron, U.S. AF, APO 929
Dear Sirs:
Even this may not be of any value. Since 9 April 1960 during the afternoon hours, a number of people in this area have reported seeing bright lights or objects in the sky. Using radar detection over this area, it was possible to confirm that several objects were in the air, but they could not be identified. All plane flying radio beams in this area from all directions were negative. I am enclosing several of the reports that have been made, and would appreciate any information that you could give us concerning this matter.
Respectfully yours,
[Signature redacted]

I have been putting these in my pocket book so they are crumpled.
