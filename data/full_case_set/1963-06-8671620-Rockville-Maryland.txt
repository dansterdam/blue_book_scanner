The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an illustration or diagram. The diagram appears to be a sketch showing the motion and direction of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or other aerial phenomenon. The diagram includes a compass rose, a curved line representing the horizon, and instructions for the viewer to draw the motion of the object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the compass where you first saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
