The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches and diagrams. The image shows a sketch of an object in the sky and a compass rose diagram. The text instructions ask the viewer to place markers on the sketches to indicate the altitude and direction of the object when first sighted, as well as to draw a picture showing the motion of the object. There is also a question asking how many objects were sighted, and the answer "EAST" is written in response.

As an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 Dec 55 24/0202
2. LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 2
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Optical
7. COURSE: East
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Satellite (possible)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer noticed two lights in the western sky that appeared as two car lights or a 300 watt bulb. The lights were slow, traveled east and finally just disappeared from view. Conversation with observer's wife (2nd witness) stated that she didn't know what a satellite looked like, but she had never seen one and only thought that there were only a very few satellites in orbit. After talking with 2nd witness, conclusions were that both witnesses have observed satellites of several occasions.
