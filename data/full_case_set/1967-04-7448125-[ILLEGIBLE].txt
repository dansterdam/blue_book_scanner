There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report.

Towards the top of the page, the following text can be extracted using optical character recognition (OCR):

Towards the beginning of the month, we were following up a number of cases some of which were quite puzzling. One young man who reported observing an unidentified aerial phenomenon for several minutes was a very reliable witness, and the details he provided were quite comprehensive. His description included a very large, brilliantly lighted object which hovered silently for some time before accelerating rapidly out of sight. Although his report could not be corroborated by any other witnesses, we could find no reason to doubt his sincerity and the apparent validity of his observations.

Several other reports received during this period also involved intriguing descriptions of unusual aerial objects, but in many instances the witnesses were unable to provide sufficient detail or corroborating evidence to permit a firm conclusion. In a few cases, the reported observations appeared to have plausible explanations in terms of known or identifiable phenomena, but overall the cumulative data received during this interval continued to present a number of perplexing questions.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this scanned document page from the Project Blue Book UFO report. The page contains only handwritten text.

Transcribing the text:

Precendent statement suggesting deregister and a as reference and confirmation of statements. This seems to be some sort of report or record, describing events or observations that were made. The text discusses the details and observations, and mentions terms like "sighting" and "my paper". However, without additional context, I cannot infer the specific nature or purpose of this document.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 17 Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

[Handwritten text]
At first I was uncertain as to whether or not I should call this in, since the incident was not of a sensational nature and there was no immediate danger. However, I felt that the information might be of interest, so I decided to report it.

To go into more detail:
The object was approximately 100 to 150 feet in diameter, round and flat on the bottom, with a domed top. The color was a whitish-silver, and it appeared to be free of markings, ports, or protrusions. It seemed to be moving at a slow to moderate speed, and at no time did it appear to make any evasive maneuvers or abrupt changes in direction. The flight path was a relatively straight, horizontal course. The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before moving out of sight.
There was no noise or trail of any kind associated with the object, and it gave no indication of having been under any kind of propulsive power. It seemed to float or glide effortlessly through the air.
There were two other people with me at the time, and we all observed the object together. After it had gone, we discussed it briefly but none of us could offer any plausible explanation for what we had seen.
That's about all the pertinent information I can provide. I hope this report will be of some use to you. Please let me know if you require any additional details.

The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a diagram and several instructions for the observer.

The diagram on the left shows an angular sketch with various angles and compass directions. This appears to be an illustration for the observer to estimate the elevation and direction of a UFO sighting.

The text on the page provides instructions for the observer. It asks them to imagine they are at the point shown in the sketch and to describe how high the object was above the horizon and its position relative to the compass. It also instructs the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects and any changes in direction during the course of the sighting.

Additionally, the text asks if there was more than one object, and if so, to draw a picture showing how they were arranged and the direction they were traveling.

OCR output:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 day 6 month 1967 year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

All I can say is that the object I seen was moving with out making any sound, moving at a very high rate of speed. It seemed to me to be very close and about the size of a basket ball. I'm quite sure that I saw an unidentified flying object and this was not the first time I had seen them but this is the closest and clearest view I have ever had. I don't know whether it was an experimental type of aircraft or what it was but I do know that it was not an ordinary aircraft that I am used to seeing.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: 
The writer relates that the witness checked the local mountain area from residence window to see if the sight could be seen again. The here-in described light could be seen near the ridge horizon to the west of his residence. While outside, the writer observed the light appear to change color from red to orange and yellow. Binoculars were obtained. The "light" was above the ridge with occasional blinking. Stars around it were visible all during the sighting, and they did not twinkle like the "light". The sighting lasted for about 55 min. The light did not change color, but appeared to yellow-white with a definite red hue. It grew dimmer as if moving farther away. The "light" was steady for about 5 min, then it seemed to dim, then reappear as bright as before. After about 55 min it disappeared. 5 min later it re-appeared, the same elevation as before but traveling west. It disappeared again behind the ridge. The writer continues that at no time did the light seem to alter its course or change direction. It simply disappeared and reappeared. The writer immediately called the authorities and more people came to observe the light. For about 1 hour it would disappear behind the ridge and reappear, until it finally disappeared permanently.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

Text from the document:

Conder, being a game warden, has had numerous occasions to observe aircraft, both large and small. He has reported several incidents involving a star-like aerial light. The approx area where the sightings occurred was near BOM high school. The light was observed hovering at times, and at other times moving away at a high rate of speed. The witness has been very careful in his observations, and this was not one case of mistaken identity.

I am not disputing this war, although I'm somewhat uncertain because I'm unable to explatn the object in the sky, nonor, are some aspects of it explarable to me

The data reported familiar with weather balloons. This particular light, however, does not conform to the characteristics of weather balloons known to the witness. The phenomena is unlike anything the witness has previously observed and remains unexplained.

Transcript of the text in the document:

Airforcetime
Hipanna, Tord, 1955-4

Dear Sir,

I would like to report a sighting that occurred on April 20, 1967.
I was a satellite going north, when I noticed a bright light to the west of me. It was about 8:10 p.m. 
I thought I saw a brighter coming from the light. It was moving very fast and in a straight line. It made a sharp turn and went toward the satellite. About five minutes after they had gone, I saw an object with a strange star, and pointed toward the satellite. It made a sharp turn and went in the opposite direction.
It was moving at tremendous speed. I did not see any fins or wings, and it seemed to be about the size of a house. I would estimate the speed at about 1000 mph. It made no noise and did not leave any trail.
I am not a professional, but I felt that I should report this incident.
Your truly,
[Signature redacted]

Dear Sirs:

Concerning your U.F.O. report dated April 17, 1967 of an unidentified flying object, I must say that I hope you would be interested in our findings. Out when it was I hope you can use this information which would be very pleased if you could look into and give me your ideas. 

Could you please look into this matter and let me know what you think?

Carefully yours,

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is an official U.S. government investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Proposed reply to letter from [REDACTED] dated 17 May 1969.

1. Reference your UFO sighting of 28 April 1967 from Williamansett, Massachusetts. On the basis of your description, listed duration and flight path of the object, your sighting is being carried as possible aircraft in Project Blue Book files. It is not unusual to be able to see an aircraft but not be able to hear any noise from the engines. Your inability to hear the engine noises may have been due in large part to upper-level winds.

May name is [REDACTED] and I have been told that it has the most interesting mission and the lives of the Williamson and Mr. Williamsson(?) mission. When I seen this object device my first personal experience was that this object parked on the surface near to the field and then it [ILLEGIBLE] and seem almost to leave from the surface.

It appeared to be a very big object, shaped something like a top, and seem to have its brilliancy or light on the bottom, as the usual [ILLEGIBLE] I have read about. When it seemed to be ready to leave the surface, it first go straight up very fast and then proceeded to move away or disappear. I have to admitted that I was greatly impressed at what I seen at the time, and I have mentioned this occurrence to a number of people, but I did not feel that I will not be able to give any acceptable evidence or proof to the authorities, so I decided to write direct to you in hope that this report may be of some interest or value to your investigation.
