UFO OVER SOFIA

Trud, no. 275, 24 Nov 67, p. 4. col. 3.  

The following information was transmitted from Sofia on Nov. 23 by telephone from the Bulgarian newspaper "Trud". At sunset, against the light, a metallic object suspended in the air with the shape of a spacefilm. It should be noted that this so-called flying object was observed for approximately 30 minutes. It is objective, the flying object looked like a ball or, more precisely, a hemisphere. It lacked any noise or flame. The Institute of Hydrology and Meteorology, said that it observed the object and therefore cannot give thorough data. But it is possible to suppose that it had its own engines. Apparently, it flew at 30 km altitude. It is interesting that it did not cause any static in the radio network.

TRANSCRIPT:

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING - BURNETTOWN/HARTWELL/ELBERTON, GEORGIA - 23 NOV 1967

DATE: 30 NOVEMBER 1967

LOCATION: Burnettown, S.C.

TO: PROJ-BLUE BOOK

HQ USAF, WASHINGTON, D.C.

1. "AT APPROXIMATELY 8:00 P.M. ON 23 NOV 67, THE WITNESS CALLED TO REPORT THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY NEAR BURNETTOWN, S.C. ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THE OBJECT WAS STATIONARY IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN SUDDENLY TOOK OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE, OF A BRIGHT ORANGE-RED COLOR, AND GAVE OFF A PULSATING LIGHT. WITNESSES STATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATING THE SURROUNDING AREA."

EVALUATIONS:
Witness: There is no previous evidence to indicate that the witness has fabricated or misrepresented what he has seen. There is no indication to the contrary.

Daytime: The sighting did occur during darkness.

Rockdale: The U.S. Coast Guard Helicopter was seen by the witness and appears to be unrelated to the UFO sighting.

CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of data (photographs/drawings) and the generally unsubstantiated nature of the report, no conclusion can be drawn other than that the witness observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Further investigative data is required.

- page 22 -

The image contains two illustrations. The first is a compass rose diagram with directional labels. The second illustration shows a person standing in the middle of a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE A "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. GIVE A COMPLETE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE TIME IT WAS FIRST SEEN AND LAST SEEN. ESTIMATE THE ALTITUDE, SPEED, AND GENERAL DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AS COMPLETELY AS POSSIBLE.

- page 23 -

The image appears to contain a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The document does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text.

Here is the text from the document:

SUBJECT: UFO Sightings - Barnwell/Allendale, South Carolina, 18-23 NOV 1967
DATE: 10 December 1967
REFERENCE: In Person
SOURCE: James H. Sabol
CHAIRMAN: NICAP, Washington, D.C.
CASE INVESTIGATORS:
10 certify that on 18 November 1967 a report was made to the Sheriff's Office, Barnwell County, South Carolina, that an unidentified flying object had been observed. It was stated that the object had been hovering over a field for approximately 15 minutes and then suddenly accelerated and raced away at a high rate of speed. The report was made by Mr. James H. Sabol, a resident of Burnettown, South Carolina. 
Mr. Sabol stated on the evening of 18 November 1967 he was sitting on his porch in Burnettown when he observed a strange light in the sky. He stated the light appeared to be hovering over a field in the distance. He stated he watched the light for approximately 15 minutes and during this time it made several unusual maneuvers. He stated the light then suddenly accelerated and raced away at a high rate of speed.
EVALUATION:
There may have been a connection between the two young boys who may have observed the same or a similar object a few days prior to 18 November 1967. However, there is no evidence to substantiate this.
INTERVIEW:
10 object was found. The light could have been a normal aircraft or a reflection of some type. No investigation could be made with any degree of reliability on this case.
LOCKPORT: The U.S. Coast Guard Helicopter was seen by Mr. Jackson to be flying in that area about that time. This could account for the sighting.
CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of data (time-distance) and the generally lack of reliable information, this case must be classified as Insufficient Information for Evaluation.
