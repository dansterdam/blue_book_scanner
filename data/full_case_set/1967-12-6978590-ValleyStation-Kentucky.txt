PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 10 Dec 67 10/05 262
2. LOCATION: Valley Station, Kentucky (2 Witnesses)
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 1/2 Minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: NE
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: (BALLOON, WEATHER)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted a bright light similar to a star or white recognition light on an aircraft that traveled in an erratic flight path. It passed through some thin layers of clouds, grew dim and finally disappeared.
COMMENTS: A weather balloon was launched from a nearby weather station at 0018 hrs. The observer did not think he saw the balloon because surface winds were blowing toward the SW and the object he saw traveled toward the NNE. However at 6,000 ft the wind was blowing ENE and at 10,000 ft was blowing NNE. This type of balloon can be seen to about 10,000 ft and ascends at about 1,000 ft minutes.

It (the object) appeared to be a point of light from a distant source. Die 2 diameter was estimated to be 4500 ft. and about 4 or 5 swept of a search light from a aircraft. The reflecting light had a white color cast to it but due to the darkness it possibly could have been any color.

The object was definitely self-luminous and gave off a white light.

The shape of the object is unknown, but is believed to be solid. One only comparable objects I know which would be close are either a large star or a white recognition light on an aircraft, but due to its very erratic flight pattern it could not have been one or the other.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text from the document:

Information which I feel is pertinent but is not adequately covered in this questionnaire, additionally provide narrative explanation of the sighting.

I was at the Twilight drive in theatre, when at 00:26 hrs, 12/10/67, I spotted a light moving in a regular pattern and on a bearing of 270 degrees must northwest. The light came into view at approximately 2500ft., and came up to the view at approximately 10-15 degrees elevation, and almost directly overhead. The object proceeded to slow on stop frequently, than resume speed and course. The object burst of speed, and climb horizon or 60 degrees from the beam horizon put an sudden burst of speed and directly away from us on the angle of approximately 60 degrees from the eastern horizon, growing dimmer and smaller until it disappeared, at approximately 1 1/2 minutes.

The atmospheric conditions onthe night of 12/9/67, and the morning of 12/10/67, were as follows: Clouds - completely overcast with light and hazy. At the time of sighting the moon was full. Overcast was at 3500 ft. Wind was from the northeast at 4 knots (5mph).

The object was in full view approximately (24) two and one half minutes.

As the object moved across the sky, it occasionally passed through the cloud cover, causing it to dim but never completely disappearing. 

The object appeared as a large star, or minute self-luminous ball which had been completed illuminated.

Upon seeing the object disappear, I proceeded to a public phone and called the traffic control tower at Standiford Field and asked about the sighting, and nothing was in communication with the tower at that time (12:30). The officer told me to report any unusual sightings, and I did so. The sergeant got on the phone and asked me several questions. I explained all I could to him at the time.

The man I was talking to at the tower told me that he would contact me later on. As approximately 01:45 hrs he called again and said that he had talked to his superiors, and said that he would contact me later as this call was at my expense, ($2.20).

He called later on and I was at home at that time. He said that he would pass this information along to his superiors, and that was that.

- page 17 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text.

The text reads as follows:

The officer asked questions similar to those he had asked the first time we talked, and proceeded to fill out the same questionnaire that he had filled out at the time and said he would receive a form to fill out and return.

At 12:30 hrs., 12/10/67, the object was sighted and I arrived at Standford Field and spoke with the man in charge of the weather Bureau. He informed me that the information regarding to the sighting (3/4 mile north of the field). When we sighted a bright distorted in the sky, two witnesses (including a weather balloon had been launched at 06:15 hrs. (They had not been down about four hours, or why it was not reported to us when I asked about it.)

I was told however, that the wind was out of the northwest at 4 knots. This would indicate the balloon would have drifted in a direction from which the object was reported to have come, and at a more rapid rate. Although my conclusion may have been just a calculation, it could not have been that far off.

I went back to my location at the time of the sighting and took along the binoculars and binocular with which I plotted my exact position, that of the object and the sight wind, and returned to the object and marked the sighting to standard field; plus the fact I saw at the air-field and put them on the map.

I have concluded that the object I sighted could not possibly have been the unidentified balloon launched at 00:13 hrs.

Due to a bad accident to my right hand I was unable to get this report returned to you any sooner.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page of text from a Project Blue Book document. The text provides details about weather balloons, including their typical diameter, burst altitudes, launch times, flight duration, and payload recovery.

WEATHER BALLOON INFO. AS GIVEN BY SGT. COLEMAN
IN THE METEOROLOGY SECT.

Weather balloons are about 6-to 8 ft. in diameter at launch.
At burst altitudes they may be between 35 and 40 ft. in diameter. 
The burst alt. for the modern case is usually over 100,000 ft.

They are usually launched 4-5 min. before 0000, 0600, 1200, and 
1800 hrs. Zulu.
The time of flight of these balloons is usually 1 to 2 hrs.
The payloads are returned to earth on a small parachute.
Sometimes at night the operator attaches a small light to
the payload. This light is usually sighted by a string to the
payload, and can be seen to about 10,000 ft.

THE RATE OF CLIMB OF THESE BALLOONS IS ABOUT 1,000 FT. PER MIN.
