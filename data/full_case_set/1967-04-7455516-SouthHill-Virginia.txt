ANALYSIS TEST REPORT
Analytical Branch (MAYA)

SUBJECT: Analysis of Samples From Paved Road
TEST NO: 7-887/888
REQUEST BY: William F. Harley, Jr. - UFOTIDET
PURPOSE: To determine the presence of a flammable material in a sample removed from a paved road surface.

FACTUAL DATA: Samples removed from a road surface were submitted for a chemical analysis. The initiator requested the analysis to determine if a flammable liquid could have been applied to the road surface and the liquid ignited. Sample 7-887 was taken from the burnt area, and sample 7-888 was submitted as a reference sample.

Both samples were extracted with carbon tetrachloride and an infrared spectrum of the extract was identified as a spectrum of the extract from the burnt area, which was identical to the spectrum of the reference sample.

CONCLUSIONS: The extract from the burnt area was identified as asphalt, and no flammable liquid could be detected. It should be noted that a very flammable liquid will burn rapidly and leave no detectable residue.

SIGHTING OF 21 APRIL, 1967 
SOUTH HILL, VIRGINIA
by C. M. CRONK

Investigated by:

On Saturday, April 22, 1957, nationwide coverage was given by the press to reports of a sighting of a large UFO seen taking off from a road in South Hill, Virginia. The investigator arrived on the scene at about 9:00 a.m., April 23, 1957. He was met by Sgt. B. H. Raines of the Virginia State Police, who provided transportation and valuable assistance and advice during the entire investigation. Lt. Hedricks of State Police Headquarters in Appomattox, Virginia, had authorized full cooperation and had also conducted his own investigation, the results of which he made available. Cooperation from the Virginia State Police could not have been given more freely, and was of great help.

The principal witness was (703/477-4177) manager of a fertilizer warehouse just on the northeast corporate limits of South Hill. (name redacted), is married and has children; during the investigation many people including all the police indicated that (name redacted), an excellent standing in the community, is a responsible citizen, and would by no means be involved in a hoax or falsehool. "If anyone but (name redacted) had made the report," the comments are, "we would not have believed him, but since it is (name redacted), we know it happened, it happened."

The second witness, who saw a portion of the event, is Mr. (name redacted) who owns extensive tobacco lands just south of and bordering on the zone on which the incident took place. He was not as well known as Mr. Grower, but seemed perfectly honest, even to the extent of sticking.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report describing an encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO). The report provides details of the witness's observations, including the size, shape, and movement of the object. There is no human face or identity mentioned in the text.

Mr. _____ report gives the following picture of the events of Friday night:

He had been working late on his books at the warehouse, and left at about 9:00 p.m. EST. At this time the sky was entirely dark. 

Closer drove north out of the warehouse parking lot, along a dirt road towards his home. Suddenly, about 1/3 mile along this narrow west country Route 751, the road dead-ends at two residences just east of this point.

By reconstruction, the events that followed were timed. Three seconds after turning onto route 751, he saw in his headlights, about 200 feet ahead of him in the center of the road, a large object. Two legs were visible, each about 6 inches in diameter and angled out somewhat, supporting a cylindrical object with a flat bottom and a dome-shaped top.  

The vertical angular subtense of this object was about one inch at arm's length (30 inches), so the vertical size projected to the apparent location would be about 17 feet. He estimated the object to be 16 to 18 feet in vertical dimensions, not counting the legs which raised the object some three feet off the ground. The lateral dimension he estimated to be about 25 feet, in color the object resembled a dark aluminum, similar to a large nitrate-cellulose tank near the warehouse.

In order to get a better look, he drove closer, to within about 250 feet of the object, which took about 9 seconds, and then switched on his bright headlights. After a delay of 4 or 5 seconds, there appeared...

suddenly a brilliant white column of fire-like white-hot molten steel, directly under the object, the column being about 13 inches in diameter. The downward jet could be seen splashing off the pavement. At the same instant, the object appeared to rise, and was out of sight in "just a snap of the fingers." At no time did the observer hear any sound; the car window was open next to him.

He did not actually see the object in flight; he says only that he could see "something going up." The white-hot flames did not travel upward, but disappeared in an instant after it appeared, leaving the road burning with orange flames. When the "tremendous burst of white-hot gas or flame" disappeared, it seemed to stop his car. At this point he saw the lights of another car coming toward him from the west, and turn into Norman Martin's road, to the south.

When drove past the smoldering patch on the road, which was still flickering in a few places the size of a hand; this was about 15 seconds after the initial burst of white fire. Apparently the flames on the smoldering road began to subside as soon as the flash was over. Crowder proceeded directly to the police station (state police) in South Hill.

Troopers Crawford and Murphy, and a newspaperman from town returned to the scene to search it. (The patch of burned tar was still warm to the touch when they returned.) The troopers first found three burned matches in the center of the blackened area (enclosed in brown envelope). The machine's edge of the paper book-type, and were completely consumed; they did not give the appearance of having been burned while held, but rather consumed.

appeared uniformly carbonized from end to end.
A thorough search was then conducted on the road around the burned area, the shoulders of the road, and the wheat fields on either side of the road (for a distance of about 25 inches tall). Nothing unusual was found. The search was conducted with the aid of two cars' headlights and with hand-held six-cell flashlights.
The following morning, another inspection of the scene revealed four small holes (see enclosed diagram) spaced at the corners of a square approximately 11.5 feet on a side, centered on the burned area. Each hole was about 1/2 inch in diameter. The edges of the holes (not and 22) had remnants of cylindrical sides and blue bottoms, and were about 3/4 inch deep. The other two were less well-defined and were shallower, about 3/6 inches deep.
Two troopers who had conducted the search the previous night are positive that the holes were not there during the first search. The holes, however, were small, and a test made at night using car headlights alone showed that they could not be visible under low-angle illumination, appearing as just another shadow among many. The troopers, however, insisted that they could not have overlooked the holes if they had been there on Friday night.
On Saturday morning, Crowder went to see Martin, to find out if Martin had seen anything the previous night. Crowder said that he was careful not to give anything away about what he had seen himself. Martin's story: In bed about 9:30 to 10:00 p.m. the night before, he had been visited by a man wearing a dark coat, who had knocked on his door. In two or three minutes, the man left, and Martin went back to bed. At about 8:30, they arrived back home. Mrs. Martin entered the house, and Mr. Martin went outside the house, in a position where he was looking north.

over his wheat field toward the road. He saw a car's headlights coming from a warehouse, and while the body of the car was hidden by the wheat, the glow of the headlights was visible travelling along route 747 to the east. As the car travelled west, the glow became brighter and brighter, until it suddenly illuminated a brilliant white light, which also lit up a large pine tree some seventy-five feet north of the road and from his viewpoint just to the left of the large tree at the roadside.
The illumination was exceedingly bright, and appeared to rise, travelling rapidly up the tree. It then went out. The witness was puzzled by this phenomenon, but could not figure further happened, he knew he had seen the light, nor did Crowder know that Martin had seen it. 
This testimony seemed to be in conflict with Crowder's story, for Crowder had said he saw car-headlights turning into the Martin driveway just after the brilliant flash of light, which he could not possibly have seen given this discrepancy. However, Crowder finally suggested that the headlights might have turned into a house just west of the entrance to his farm, so that the location (only about 200 feet farther west) for the Martins' road. That turned out to be the case. Mr. Martin who lived in the house in question, did not see his roadview illuminated at about nine p.m. his wife nor anyone else north-west bedroom in the immediate vicinity) any lights as from a car's headlights turning into their driveway. However, nobody knocked on the door and she assumed that someone had merely turned around in the yard.

TESTS

Two tests were performed by the investigator with the aid of Sgt. Barnes. The first involved making a crude impact tester (see diagram) for the purpose of seeing how easily a 1/2-inch hole could be made in the road surface (tarred gravel).

The impact tester consisted of a weight mounted on the end of a board, the other end of which was hinged to a smaller double thickness of board on which a person could stand to hold the apparatus steady. Just beyond the weight a 1/2-inch bolt was fastened through the board, protruding slightly.

downward about 3/4 inch. A metal plate was used to distribute the impact. By allowing the weighted end of the board to fall from the vertical onto the pavement, the bolt could be driven into the surface with a reproducible and known impact.

The weight resting on the bolt with the board horizontal was 47.5 pounds, and the distance to height through which the weight fell was 30 inches. Our tests were made near the four existing holes, with depths of penetration as follows:

Test No.            Penetration, in units of 1/32 inch
1                   13      (near NE hole)
2                   13.5    (near SE hole)
3                   15      (near SW hole)
4                   13      (near NW hole)

Average =           13.6/32 inch

If it is assumed that the deceleration after impact was uniform, then the average force f required to stop a weight W (that has been accelerated by gravity downward through a distance H) acting over the penetration depth d, is simply

f = W/d.

The penetration will depend on the square of the velocity, so the weight of an object required to produce a given penetration will depend on the squared ratio of its impact velocity V to the impact velocity Vo in the test situation; Vo was 12.62 feet per second, by calculation. Wo indicates the test weight, and Y the weight associated with velocity Vo.

W = 47.5 (W/12.6)^2 per "log", for 13/32" penetration.

- page 28 -

There is no photograph present in this scanned document. However, the text contains a detailed technical examination and analysis of the impact holes and the original holes observed, discussing aspects such as the edges, flow characteristics, and weight involved in the incident. The text also mentions attempts to reproduce the burn-mark on the object.

Examination of the results of the impact that showed significant differences between the impact holes and the northeast original hole, which was the most clearly delineated. The impact holes had sharp edges and seemed to indicate that the object had passed through the rocks and been pushed into the holes. There were no signs of sheared-through rocks in the northeast original hole.

Around the northeast original hole was a rim of tar which had apparently oozed up as the hole was made; the impact holes, on the other hand, showed sharp edges with no signs of flow of the tar. The impact holes were full of white powder from shattered rocks; none was seen in the original holes, although 36 hours had passed before arrival of the investigator, and foreign matter had been blown or pushed into the holes.

The indications apparently are that the original holes were made at considerably lower velocity than the impact holes, which means in turn that the weight involved had to be larger than 81 pounds per leg (correcting for depth of original holes). At zero velocity the question breaks down, and because of the flow characteristics or tar the higher weights (going with the lower velocities) should be corrected downward. A more exact analysis is left to those better acquainted with hardness tests. Nevertheless the indications are that a rather heavy object (such as the end of a pickaxx) making a high-velocity impact with the road.

The second test involved attempts to reproduce the burn-mark on the object.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing text describing an incident involving a gasoline fire on a road.

The text reads as follows:

road. The first test, using kerosene, failed because the kerosene could not be lit with a match. A piece of burning paper finally started a fire, after perhaps twenty seconds of burning, and then the fire progressed in a narrow strip across the object which was of solid, undetermined material, until it reached the first edge, where it went out. Total burning time was on the order of ten minutes.

A quart of gasoline was then spread over an area similar to the original, and set afire with a match. The first attempt to light it by dropping a burning match into the center failed, because there was not enough oxygen despite the bright visible flame. The second match was applied at the edge of the wetted area, which then burst instantly into flame. The flame burned at essentially a constant rate for about fifty seconds, and died out at sixty-eight seconds of elapsed time. A heavy black smoke was created, which formed a black semicircular area about a foot in extent on the pavement downwind from the burning patch a minute, but much lighter within, grew was to be seen two or three of the original patch, the downwind direction for the night of the sighting.

The effect of the gasoline fire on the road was far greater than what the original burn showed (although comparison was somewhat difficult due to the lapse of time and failure to keep traffic off the evidence). The gasoline fire melted a great amount of tar, which formed into pools. No pools at all are evident in the original. The flow of tar in the gasoline test resulted in disappearance of many stones under a coating of tar, yet all the stones in the original patch remained visible and were.

Free of soot at least at the time of the comparison. The stones in the original patch each had a slightly raised rim of bright tar around the edges, as if molten tar had been blown up around the stones; the stones in the gasoline test, if they remained visible above the tar, showed no such raised-rim effects. The test areas were burned the most in the upward direction, the pooling of tar being greatest there; the original patch was essentially uniform over all its area.

There were, in other words, noticeable differences between the original patch and the results of the burn-test. It is possible to interpret the original patch as being the result of a high-temperature blasts directed downward, playing over the surface of the road for a short time. The raised rims of tar around the stones suggest that the tar became more liquid than the stones, owing perhaps to its black color and the generally lighter color of the stones. In the gasoline test the stones quickly acquired a coating of soot and were black as or blacker than the tar before the fire went out. The fire survived only a few seconds after extinguishment of the gasoline; the rapid dying out of the flames noted by Grover could mean that a much smaller quantity of flammable fluid was used (if a hose was involved) or else that the tar was ignited strictly by a rise in its temperature, no foreign substances being involved.

Samples were taken from three areas (identified by slips of paper inside the packing in the three plastic containers). Material was taken from the center of the burned patch, from the center of an area which a trooper had blackened by applying a lighted flare to it, or fuse, and from an area well away from any affected part of the road. The samples were scraped up with the end of a tire-iron, which was painted black.

An attempt was then made to get casts of the three holes which were not as well-defined as the northeast hole. Sgt. Raines poured plaster of Paris into these holes with paper clips arranged to permit pulling out the plugs. It was anticipated that some difficulty might be encountered, so the best hole was left untouched. The southeast hole gave the most difficulty due to its depth; finally the road had to be chipped carefully away from the cast, not, however, without damaging the cast. All recoverable pieces are enclosed. Material which adhered to the casts was left on them. The other two casts were pulled out directly with only minor damage. These casts are wrapped in cotton in the empty cotton-box, which also contains the envelope with the matches in it. In retrospect, of course, one can think of several more intelligent ways to obtain impressions of the holes without damaging them, such as using modeling clay or wax.

Conclusions

This is a peculiar case, primarily because of the apparently excellent reliability (in the sense of truthfulness) of the principal witness. If one takes the description of events as given by the witness at face value, then the physical evidence follows logically from the position, appearance, and behavior of the object. The object had legs which were left on the ground. The object was larger; the marks on the ground were made by a heavy object settling close to the pavement. The object departed with a blast of very high-temperature flames that splashed off the roadway; the car was ignited by the flames and immediately away; the appearance of the burned area indicates a blast of heat.

On the other hand, if one considered only the physical evidence so far available and so far analyzed, he would be bound to conclude that a hoax was highly probable. The presence of matches suggests that gasoline (not much less than a quart) was used to ignite a patch on the road; a clever and energetic person could have made the holes in the pavement.

The fact that the holes were not discovered until the next day strongly suggests that they were put there after the sighting but before the inspection the following day. The irregular but sharp outlines of the burn and the irregularity of the burn suggest that a downward jet played on the road at one fixed position; the absence of any outwardly directed blast-marks gives similar cause for doubt (although if the heat were applied directly as heat radiation there would be no blast marks).

In other words, the appearance of the physical traces can be used to argue either for or against the reliability of the witness account.

At this writing, therefore, in the absence of any additional clues or the results of chemical analysis, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the witness probably did see something out of the ordinary, but that we cannot rule out the possibility that a hoax was perpetrated by some person or persons other than the principal witness. A possible hoax is involved, but evidence for it is not clear.

THE SOUTH HILL CASE

New evidence and insight into the UFO case that occurred on April 21, 1967, at South Hill, Va., was obtained during a two-day interview on December 16-17 and from follow-up investigations. Persons of the principal in the case, including Gifford Crowner, were interviewed. The interviews were recorded on tape.

This report has been prepared, without charge, for use by the Air Force Project Blue Book and by the University of Colorado UFO Study Group. No other use or release is intended by the author.

Even these two agencies are cautioned against public use or publication of the two paragraphs marked with a triple asterisk (***)which contain candid quotations from the interviews or author conclusions.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the general details of the South Hill case and has read the official case report prepared by William T. Powers of Northwestern University for the Air Force, dated May 10, 1967.

This case seems to this author to be an especially interesting one for several reasons:

1. It demonstrates that physical evidence which may upon superficial examination seem to provide evidence of extra-terrestrial visitations can actually demonstrate quite a different conclusion.

2. It shows how failure to report the full details of a UFO case can mislead the general public into a false conclusion that the earth has been visited by extra-terrestrial visitors.

3. It illustrates that nature seems quite adept at "hoaxes" and "tricks" that can be easily misinterpreted as some unexplainable paranormal or extraterrestrial event. (***)

The Evidence
The credibility of Clifford Crawford's story that he saw a large, fast-moving object striking on four places on East Farrell St. shortly before 9 p.m. on the evening of April 21, 1967, and that the object suddenly disappeared with a blinding flash that left the ground scorched, according to the following:

1. The burned spot on the road. According to some accounts, the rocks in the area were still warm to the touch when Crowder and the local police returned to the scene a few minutes later. 

2. Four tiny holes, or "indentations", measuring approximately 1/2 inch in diameter, or 1 1/4 inch apart, which were found at the site the following morning but not on the evening of the incident.

3. The statement by Norman Martin, who lives 600 feet south of East Farrell St., that he saw bright illumination on trees near the burned spot for a brief interval at approximately the time that Crowder says the incident occurred.

4. Mr. Crowder's long-standing reputation in the community.

The Burned Spot
Crowder's story is that the brief but intense burst of fire emitted by the object when it took off, or disappeared, set fire to the asphalt-macadam road. On at least fourteen occasions during two recorded interviews, Crowder referred to flame and fire on the road. For added confirmation, upon returning to Washington, I wrote him to ask if the road was wet from rain, or if there were other evidence such as charred vegetation. He replied: "The road was flaming after the flash of light. At first the flame was about 3 ft. high. When I passed the flame was going out, but the ground surface on either side of the burned spot was still burning - a total area of 7 ft. in diameter or more from the time I passed the burning pavement."

Other investigators have assumed that the asphalt was set afire. According to the Asphalt Institute in Washington, D.C., asphalt is very difficult to ignite. But the Asphalt Institute noted that the ingredients used in the production of the asphalt in use on East Farrell St., "has since been removed" in more recent usage. And the road there "WILL NOT CONTINUE TO BURN. It cooks over and puts itself out," according to Gornthwaite.

It is true that fast-curing types of asphalt, which are dissolved in naphtha, might briefly support combustion for several days after being laid. But the road on East Farrell St. was not freshly laid, Gornthwaite said, even if the asphalt were still porous.

THIS MEANS THAT THE BURNED SPOT ON THE ROAD WAS PRODUCED BY SOME TYPE OF FLAMMABLE LIQUID OR MATERIAL. THIS, CONCEIVABLY, COULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED BY THE "OBJECT", BY CROWDER HIMSELF, OR BY OTHERS.
IF THE FLAMMABLE MATERIAL WAS DEPOSITED BY THE "OBJECT," THEN IT
WAS IGNITED BY THE"OBJECT" IN THE PROCESS OF TAKE-OFF. IT DEPOSITED
BY CROWDER OR OTHERS, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IGNITED BY MORE CONVENTIONAL

THE FACT THAT ALL FOUR MATCHES WERE COMPLETELY CHARRED INDICATES
THAT THEY WERE ON THE ROAD AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE.
THE DISCOVERY OF THESE CHARRED MATCHES PRODUCED AN INTERESTING REACTION, BUT NOT A SURPRISING ONE, AMONG THOSE PRESENT. (RECALL THAT CROWDER WAS AT HOME AT THE TIME.)
TROOPER CRAWFORD DECIDED NOT TO BOTHER TO REPORT THE INCIDENT (CROWDER'S
REPORT) TO HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR, SIT. D.H. DAILEY, HEAD OF THE LOCAL

I ASKED TROOPER CRAWFORD IF ANY OF THE OTHER OFFICERS PRESENT ALSO
WERE SUSPICIOUS. HIS REPLY WAS... "AFTER WE FOUND THE MATCHES."
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHOSE SUSPICIONS
WERE AROUSED. FRANCES L. HUCKETT, A RESIDENT/PHOTOGRAPHER FOR THE

Text extracted from the document:

Although the officers did discover the small, charred matches on the ground around the spot where the object landed on the night of April 21, they did not discover even one of the four holes within six feet of the burned spot. This raises the question of whether those "impressions" were indeed there on the night of April 21, or whether they were created in the pre-dawn hours of April 22.

It is only one of the four holes had been discovered that night, it is probable that all four would have been found. So there were four "impressions" for discovery. Trooper Crawford told me that he and Murphy made a careful search, bending down low over the road, using a 6-cell flashlight. Crawford finds it hard to believe that the holes could have been overlooked.

- page 47 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text from a Project Blue Book report.

Sgt. Raines, who heads the local Virginia State Police office, acknowledges that "Crowder Crawford did make a right through fellow, and ordinarily I'd say that when he says the holes weren't there, they weren't there." But Raines, who is a member of the same church as Crowder, says he is sure that "the holes were there that night."

He explains that the reason they were not found is that Crowder had described the UFO's logs as being 5-6 inches in diameter, and so the officers naturally were looking for large indentations on the road, not tiny holes. Raines adds that the next morning when he was told of the four holes and went to the site, he still had trouble finding them in broad daylight.

But trooper Crawford says that when he heard about the holes the next day and returned to the site at night, he said he did find them "without being shown where they were."

If the holes were there on Friday night, it would neither confirm nor deny the presence of a UFO. But if the holes were NOT there Friday night, then the case is clearly a hoax, for this would mean that they were dug sometime after midnight (when the officers left for the night) and the following morning.

If the "indentations" were added in the pre-dawn hours of April 22, it seems safe to conclude that this was done to provide additional evidence to support the original story and to continue suspicions raised by the discovery of the charred matches. As of midnight, only a handful of people knew of the discovery of the charred matches - Clifford Crowder was one of this handful.

So far as is known, Crowder was the first man to return to the area the next morning, at approximately 7 a.m., while on his way to work. Although Crowder took time to stop and talk with Norman Martin about events at the previous night's official investigation, but he did not drop in to check on the site. This inspection later raised the suspicion that Crowder would not show more curiosity, especially since he was so early for work on a Saturday morning.

But as a result, Crowder was not the first to discover the four small holes at the site. Nor is it known who was the first to discover the holes. None of the document persons interviewed claimed this honor, nor did they know who had first spotted them.

Sgt. Raines said he was sitting in Crowder's office, only 1,000 ft. away from the site, when he received word about the four holes. Raines says Crowder showed a surprising lack of curiosity about this important new discovery. He told me that it was not until an hour or two later, when Crowder drove home for lunch, that he stopped to see the newly discovered holes.

- page 48 -

There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains only text, which I will transcribe below.

During the first interview with Crowder, he spoke of "ashes" that had been found on the burned spot that night. (Apparently this was a reference to his clothing being burned in the incident). Crowder stated that some of these ashes had been analyzed, and Crowder explained that they had been washed away because it "poured down rain that night." 

If it had rained midway between midnight and daylight the following day, and if the four holes had been there the night before, there should have been some rainwater in the holes when they were discovered Saturday morning.

Had it rained since he had arrived at the site around 10-11 a.m. - He replied: "There was nothing" when he explained that Crowder had said that it rained that night. Raines responded heatedly: "There didn't anything rain. There wasn't any rain."

Had it rained, Robert Harrs, who said he remained at the site until shortly after midnight and who put his film on the 2 a.m. but for Richmond, could not remember? He had worked until 12 around 1 a.m., he recalled, and he remembered that there was never any rain.

Upon returning to Washington, I checked the Weather Bureau. They told me that their station at Raleigh, N.C., approximately 60 miles to the south of South Hill, had reported no precipitation from 3-6 p.m.

This suggests that Crowder was awake in the very early morning hours of April 22 since he was the only one to recall the "hard shower."

Norman Martin's Role:

Mr. & Mrs. Norman Martin, who live approximately 600 ft. south of the scene, arrived in South Hill sometime during the evening of April 21. Mr. Martin says they were awakened by bright lights, which would mean they were awakened around 10-11 minutes. 

Allowing 5 minutes for the Martins to walk to their car, and another 5 minutes to drive home, they should have arrived at their driveway and turned south from Route 58 at approximately 10:20 p.m.

Working backward for Crowder, he arrived at the local police station for him to drive to the station from the site, and a minute or two for the time he says he waited for the flames to die down, this would place the incident at somewhere between 8:50 and 9:55 p.m.

Text output from the document:

Thus the Martins were arriving home from the hospital at roughly the same time as the incident would have occurred, according to Crowder's account.

And Crowder says he saw the headlights of a car heading east just after the incident, which set fire to the field. This car turned south, seemingly into the Martin driveway. (See Powers report, p. 5.)

IF THIS CAR WAS UNDRED THE MARTINS, WHY DID THEY NOT SEE THE FLAMES?
- IS THE ROAD? THEIR CAR WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY 400 FEET AWAY AT THIS TIME-
AND WHY DIDN'T THE MARTINS SEE THE HEADLIGHTS OF CROWDER'S CAR?

To resolve this hard-to-answer question and to explain the apparent conflict of Martins' statement that he saw an intense flash of light on the trees near the site while standing in his backyard, Powers and others have concluded that the car the Martins saw was NOT the Martins'.

Instead, the "mystery car" that Crowder saw is assumed to have turned south into the driveway, approximately 200 feet west of the Martin driveway. It is reasoned that Crowder could easily have turned into thinking the car turned into the Martin drive when in fact the "mystery car" merely turned around in the King drive and headed back toward South Hill.

Powers wrote in his report: "That turned out to be the case. Mr. King, who lived in the house in question, said that a car about nine feet wide, and was in the northwest bedroom (from which the scene of the sighting was visible), saw a flash as from a car headlight burning into their drive-in. However, nobody knocked on the door and she assumed that someone had just turned around in the driveway." If this were true, then the discrepancy is cleared up."

Furthermore, there are no windows on the west side of the main house (from Powers' description) so there was anyone in the northwest bedroom who could not have seen the lights from a car approaching from the west, unless they were turned out.

Finally, in an interview with Mrs. C.A. King, she flatly denies that a car could have turned around in her yard that evening. Here are her own words:

"My daughter was in the front part of the house (facing East Farrell Street) standing and I was in the kitchen (back) and we saw lights flash and I thought a car was in the back...I'm sure it was a flash but it wasn't a car. I thought it was because we went out into the back and there wasn't anyone there."

- page 51 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, likely a transcript or report. As an OCR system, I will extract the text from the document:

Thinking perhaps that I had misunderstood, I asked: "So do you think it was a car that turned in?"

Mrs. King replied emphatically: "No, no, it wasn't a car, because we went out and looked and there wasn't a car anywhere because it couldn't have had time to get away. There was this other light, this other car, people said, that came down the road and turned off, and they said they got a better view of traffic coming up from South Hill."

Before departing, I again asked: "You are quite sure than that there was no car that troubled this view?" This being responded to, "No, because our daughter was looking out the window and it seemed to go back on the porch and she went clean out into the yard and there wasn't a car going or coming."

Illustrating the power of suggestion and the impact of this incident on some of the local residents, Mrs. King told me that just before her brother-in-law came home, she had a light flashing in the back window." (This she said would not be explained from the direction of Martin's house.) Mrs. King added that at the same moment, "I heard something sound exactly like a terry-baby like an infant crying." Now my daughter had the children but they were both fast asleep." (Note: This is believed to be the first report of a UFO that made this kind of sound.)

Despite this evidence that there was in fact no "mystery car," and that the "car" Crowder said he saw was in fact Martin's car, it is possible to resolve most of the apparent conflicts between the accounts of Crowder and Martin as will be explained shortly.

On at least several occasions, when Crowder has described his visit to Martin on the morning of April 22, Crowder has emphasized that he did see the UFO encounter to Martin before Martin volunteered that he (Martin) had seen a light. Here are Martin's own words: "He came down here the next morning...We'd just gotten up, I'd say between 7 and 8 o'clock. And there - there's nothing unusual around here. Well, I said 'Did you see that light up there last night?' - he said - 'Yeah, I saw a terrible light up there last night'."

Martin explained: "After he brought this up, it made me think that, which man is telling the truth?" In the first of two interviews with Crowder, he had volunteered the following comment about Martin: "Well, to tell you the truth, Martin is not considered a very reliable citizen...he's just a very ordinary share-cropper farmer...he's not considered a very substantial citizen."

- page 52 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document page from Project Blue Book, discussing an incident related to a person named Crowder.

Later, when I asked Martin about Crowder's reputation, Martin replied: "If Mr. Crowder... (chuckles) I can't say the man is not telling the truth because I don't know anything of his private life. But if he saw anything, then I saw the light from it."

On several other occasions, Martin claimed to have seen the light from Crowder's car while Crowder was inside. He said, "If he (Crowder) saw the real object, then I saw the light from it."

Martin volunteered an interesting comment about the remarkable similarity between the large aluminum tank used by Crowder to store liquid fertilizer which sits just outside his office window. Martin says the incident did not strike him as extraordinary at the time, because the 600 debt points to Crowder's normal activities like going outside long enough for the police to arrive at the site.

According to the text, the document is discussing a "Trail Hypothesis" related to the question of how it was possible for Crowder to see the headlights of his car, when the car lights were turned off, and if the road was not yet arrived.

would park his car while he poured flammable fluid on the road and lit it. 
It would be sticky to park on the road surface, and with the car lights on, for 
this would illuminate his activities and he might be seen by someone in the 
King house and the police would become alert. Yet the park lights would risk 
a collision if another car suddenly came along.

It would be logical indeed for Crowder to park in the driveway of the 
"Johnson house," knowing that it was then unoccupied, for he could then
get off the cars lights and be sure that Crowder says he stopped his car roughly 
opposite this same driveway when the intense flash of light occurred.)

If this hypothensis is correct, Crowder would be very alert to any 
approaching car while carrying out his mission, so he could quickly take 
cover. If the flaxion came over this car near the King house while he 
was pouring the flammable liquid on the road, Crowder certainly would take 
cover and probably would not resume his activities until he saw the Martin 
car arrive home, its lights go out and then he would assume that both Mr. & 
Mrs. Martin had gone inside. 

After lighting the fluid, he would return to his car and wait for the 
flames to die down. Then, turning on his car lights, he would turn west 
(left) onto East Farrell St. and drive to the police station. As Crowder's 
car turned onto East Farrell St., he got a car meeting him who should illuminate the car 
sufficiently to expose the object burned spot and it would be this illumination that 
Martin reported seeing.

Because of a drop-off in elevation and the intervining wheat field, 
Martin would not be able to see Crowder's car - only the illumination
from its headlights. (This was checked by placing a car at the site and
trying to see it from Martin's background.)

Since the "Johnson house" was then unoccupied, Martin would not 
expect there to be any reason coming out of this driveway. Recall Martin's 
statement: "...many times I've seen them come out and the car 
still shining on the trees there. Well, I didn't pay too much attention to
it at the time." Thus Martin would continue on at normal speed to prompt 
Martin to six hundred feet north to East Farrell St. to investigate.

This trial hypothesis seems to fit quite well. But what of the 
other possibility that Crowder was merely the victim of a hoax, not its 
perpetrator?

Incidentally, after the incident, Crowder said that he had seen a tank-
like object floating on legs. He described it as being metallic and he 
saw the reflected light from the headlights.

But more recently, and later in my interview, Crowder says that he 
believes the object "was a gas-filled flammable bag" which was designed 
to illuminate when illuminated by car headlights. On several occasions,
Crowder now believes the object was not a tank, but rather a psychological experiment, and that one of the branches of the armed forces is fooling with."

The question arises as to how good are Crowder's powers of observation?
Prior to driving to South Hill, I had prepared a night 25 mm. flares which
were designed to test his powers of observation.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, discussing an incident that occurred in South Hill, Virginia on April 7, 1967.

Text from the document:

The slides, in color, were taken of an unfamiliar object or an unusual assemblage of familiar objects of a distinctive sky. The object was illuminated by two photoflood lamps, one on either side of the camera, to enable the illumination from two angles. One object, for the most part, was an erratic wanderer in the night sky from horizon to horizon. It stood out as if it were an erratic wanderer from a fixed position, not always in the same place, and different in shape from the Crowder UFO, according to his description. Two additional slides show the obligatory flashing and a picture of an unusual gas laser.

Crowder's descriptions were so accurate and perceptive that it seems quite unikkely time on the nights of April 7th really saw one or two human figures on the road and scenery instincts them for a large total satellite or station as in the Crowder case.

And Crowder insists that this is what he saw. He has classified his tower-light object only to the extent that it might have been a large balloon which disintegrated suddenly (to explain its sudden disappearance).

In recent months, someone has painted "PTV C7 HOAX" alongside the burned spot on the road. The "PTV" stands for "Park View High School", suggesting the sign is the work of local teen-agers. (Crowder himself was too sophisticated for such a prank).

I asked Crowder if he thought the incident of his UFO encounter could have been a hoax staged by local high school kids to have built some artificial satellites of their own recorded for science. He replied it was too complicated for high school kids to have built that could be seen, and also that the object's behavior did not appear to be the work of amateurs (inside his office) and it had those three telltale characteristics.

- page 57 -

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. As an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

5. The inconsistency of the size of the "pedprints" for an object the size which Crowder reported, which would result in fantastically high bed leading (see Appendix "A"), and the imperfect symmetry of the "pedprints" locations.

6. The lack of symmetry of the burned spot itself, a free-form shape which suggests it was formed by the chance flow of a flammable liquid.

7. The fact that Crowder reported seeing the Martin car immediately after the road was set afire, yet neither Mr. nor Mrs. Martin saw the flames or the headlights of Crowder's car.

Rea Ipsa Loquitur:

But what of Clifford Crowder's high standing in the community? The truth is that, an outside investigator is only able to determine whether or not an in-depth study were made and no investigator, including this one, has attempted such a study.

It is a matter of record that Clifford Crowder is active in the affairs of his church, the South Hill Methodist Church. Beyond this, his difficulties in solving this case may have personal bearings of which this investigator is unaware.

One brother, J. Foster Crowder, is a member of the Virginia State Highway Dept. Another brother, J.L. Crowder, was a member of the Republican group at the time of the incident and was running for re-election. He was defeated in the primary held several months ago by the incumbent, A certain Christian C. Crowder, is an advertiser in the local newspapers. Dr. Charles H. Crowder, an M.D., is a more distant relative.

Every person interviewed spoke highly of Clifford Crowder, and corroborated a character endorsement without even being asked. Under normal circumstances, almost certainly would give him a good character endorsement. A man of 55, he is not an impecunious, sinister and well-mannered.

Yet it is difficult to predict what any person will, or will not, do. Every bank attempts to hire only people of unquestioned character lest positions of financial responsibility be entrusted to persons. Yet every year sees disclosures of embezzlements by just such people, followed by expressions of shocked surprise by friends and business associates.

- page 58 -

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"So far as can be determined, Clifford Crowder was not and still is not, what could be termed a "UFO buff."

But UFOs "were in the air" around South Hill. The town is within range of two American Broadcasting Company TV stations: WLEE (Channel 8) in Richmond and WXEX (Channel 8) in Petersburg. It was approximately between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m. on April 19, 1967, that Clifford Crowder's children watched the "Invaders" program on ABC's television network. (Mrs. C.A. King mentioned that some of the neighborhood children watch the show and were therefore quite excited over the Crowder UFO report.)

Probably a more influential program is one by Frank Edwards, called "Strange Things Are Happening" - also broadcast in this area. It is believed by the South Hill UFO observers that Edwards' program "stimulated" a great deal of interest and acceptance by the public and did not limit itself exclusively to flying saucers, they are featured prominently along with other supposed true stories of the occult and supernatural.

A further interest factor for The South Hill Enterprise. In the April 27, 1967, issue, the first of a series of four articles appeared written by William Hayton devoted his entire column to the subject of UFOs. One extract from this column is particularly interesting: "The important thing is that one (UFO) made the scene at South Hill and South Hill is now really on the map."

This proved to be a meaningful understatement. South Hill was deluged with visitors, thousands of them, immediately after the incident was reported in the local and national press, and for some weeks afterwards.

Crowder himself has achieved national, even international fame. He has received telephone calls from as far away as Australia, from UFO buffs who want to hear him describe the incident in his own words.

Sgt. Raines says that Crowder has become "fed up" with all this attention and has, in a manner of speaking, said "I'll keep it to myself." But Crowder himself gave no indication of this attitude and did make his experience known publicly. He cooperated fully, showed up on time, and his disclaimers come at the time and his disappearance from the continuing irritation is being questioned. (However, because I had no other source to rely upon the continuing cooperation, I did not press him on such matters as the chance encounter, it did not prove him on such matters as the chance encounter, it did not press him on such matters as the continuing cooperation.)

The Illusion
The South Hill case demonstrates how the illusion that UFOs must be extraterrestrial spacecraft is promoted in the public mind by impressive incidents, especially when they involve a publicized close encounter of the "third kind" in which the witness achieves some personal fame."

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document on UFO reports from Project Blue Book.

TEXT OUTPUT:

The four charred matches found on the burned spot raised grave
suspicions of a hoax among police officers and reporters at the scene.
by their examination, Harris himself said he almost didn't send his
film and story to the Richmond Times-Dispatch and News Leader. Yet when
the story did appear in the two newspapers, THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE MENTION
OF THE CHARRED MATCHES.

As a result, the Associated Press story on the case which appeared
in newspapers around the country made no mention of the charred matches.

It was not until William Powers visited South Hill on April 23 and
mentioned this important finding in discussions with the Press that the
charred matches were mentioned, somewhat casually, in the few newspapers
that carried the story.

Three men from NICAP Headquarters, one a NASA physicist, visited
South Hill on April 22. The results of their investigation were reported
in a feature story in the March-April, 1967, issue of "The U.F.O. Investigator." They referred to the burned spot and the four "punctures"
but, again, there was no mention of the charred matches. It was not
until the May-June, 1967, issue of "The U.F.O. Investigator" that the
no mention of the charred matches.

The new Frank Edwards book, "Flying Saucers -- Here and Now," devotes
two full pages to the South Hill case. But again, there is no mention of
the charred matches. It seems safe to predict that the South Hill case
will continue to be reported in books and magazines that will cite it
in most, if not all, there will be no mention of the charred matches.

The cause of public enlightenment is not well-served either by
"premature publicity" or by "official investigation." For example:

"Groder is telling exactly what he saw and there is no reason to
disbelieve his story." This statement is attributed to William Powers in
the April 27, 1967, issue of The South Hill Enterprise. It is quoted
also in the May 10, 1967, issue of Dixie Dispatch.

"(I) can't think of it being a hoax," Dr. J. Allen Hynek, as quoted
in the May 10, 1967, issue of Dixie Dispatch.

Obviously, it is not politic to dismiss the Press with a curt "no
comment"; but serious problems can't just disappear suggest that it would
be better for an investigator to explain that it is premature to comment
on the case until the investigation has been completed and that this will
require some additional time.

- page 60 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a technical document discussing the design analysis of a "Crowder UFO".

A DESIGN ANALYSIS OF THE CROWDER UFO:

1. The tank-shaped UFO as described by Crowder was estimated to be approximately 120 ft. in diameter and 15 ft. high.

2. The Apollo Lunar Module has somewhat similar overall dimensions, although it is not a simple cylinder. The Lunar Module is approximately 20 ft. high and 14 ft. in diameter. According to the simplified sketch, the total enclosed volume is somewhat less.

3. The Lunar Module is expected to weigh approximately 30,000 lb. This would give it a specific weight of 10 lb./cu. ft.

4. Assuming that the Crowder UFO had the same specific weight as the Lunar Module (10 lb./cu. ft.), then the Crowder UFO would weigh 17,000 lb.

5. The Lunar Module has four landing pads, each 37 inches in diameter, giving it a total pad area of 1,200 sq. in.

6. This gives the Lunar Module a pad-loading of 7 psi. on earth.

7. But when landing on the Moon, which has only 1/6th earth gravity, the effective Lunar Module pad-loading will be 1.2 psi.

8. The four "padprints" allegedly left by the Crowder UFO each measured approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The total "padprint" area of the four is then approximately 1.96 sq. in.

9. This gives the Crowder UFO a pad-loading of approximately 17,000 psi. (Based on assumed specific weight of 10 lb./cu. ft.)

10. Four-lane concrete highways are stressed to withstand loads of 640 psi.

11. Thus, the "design" of the Crowder UFO, by failing to use larger pads, ended up with a "craft" whose pad loading is 30 times too high to enable it to land on major highways without puncturing the concrete.

Dear Mr. Crowder:

First I should like to thank you for your kindness in spending time with us on the 14th. I know this time you must be very weary of the whole matter after having reported the story so many times.

Would you be kind enough to clarify a couple points for me?

1. After the intense flash of light and after the object had disappeared or disintegrated, was there a sound you heard that you described as a whoosh or was the spot where the object had been, completely silent?

2. If you saw flames, approximately how high would you say the flames were, i.e., in such relation to the object as it was, a foot? 

3. If you saw flames going out, or until you felt it was safe to before going out, or until you felt it was safe to before going out, or until you felt it was safe to leave, how long did it last?

Again, thanks for your assistance.

Cordially,
(signed)
Philip J. Klass

1- The object was sighted briefly and there was a flash of light, but no sound was heard after the object disappeared.
2- No flames were mentioned, only a bright light.
3- No information is provided about flames going out or how long the event lasted.

Virginian Tells of UFO | 
BLACK OBJEcT SEEMED 'ON FIRE'

SOUTH HILL, Va. (AP) - Fire chief Corbin Hendrick said he saw a big flaming object like a burning airplane passing overhead Monday night and found a burned spot on the ground where it appeared to have touched down. 

"It was just a flash and it was gone. But it seemed to be on fire as it passed over," said Hendrick, who was in charge of South Hill's volunteer fire department.

Hendrick said he ran outside his home and watched the object, which he said was about the size of a small automobile, pass overhead at about 200 feet. He said it appeared to be a black object that "seemed to be on fire."

After the object disappeared, Hendrick said he and other firemen searched the area and found a burned spot about 10 feet across on a road near South Hill. They said the spot appeared to have been made by intense heat.

State police were called and arrived at the scene shortly after, the article states. The article also mentions that an Air Force investigator was dispatched to look into the incident.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD: 26 APRIL 1967

Contact with Lt. Colonel Krell revealed the following information pertaining to the South Hill, Virginia sighting of 21 April 1967. Lt. Colonel Krell said that he personally drove to the South Hill area and investigated the case. The four holes were said. They were approximately 5 feet 6 inches apart forming a square. The burnt area was in the middle of the square. When the policeman arrived at the scene the pavement was cold. It was an asphalt highway. Lt. Colonel Krell could find no additional witness who saw the alleged UFO. The witness reported no sound at all, even after stopping the car and rolling down the window. Lt. Colonel Krell will contact the South Hill police department and obtain a written statement concerning what was found at the scene of the sighting.
