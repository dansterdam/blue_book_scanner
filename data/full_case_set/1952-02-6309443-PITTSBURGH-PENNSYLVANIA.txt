5. Major Gedeon is believed to be a fairly competent witness in that he is a self-admitted, not given to fantasy or exaggeration. In his own mind there is no doubt that the object sighted was not a meteor.

6. In order to supplement the information originally submitted, Major Gedeon has completed a questionnaire supplied by OSIL. (Inclosure 2).

7. The above is furnished for whatever value it may have.

Washington 25, D. C.

1. This office submitted a report (copy attached as inclosure) dated 23 February 1952, concerning a sighting of an unidentified objects, reported by two officers of this command.

2. Subsequently, this Headquarters received an ATIC report (Project BLUE BOOK, Report No. 5) dated 31 March 1952, which made reference to the above report (references BLUE 5 item 5) with the following comments:

"description similar to meteor"

3. It is the opinion of this office that the conclusions arrived at are in error. Subsequent conversations with Major Gedeon reveal the following:

a. That he has observed meteors and in this instance the course of the object appeared to be a straight line and did not have the characteristic orbit of a meteor.

b. Although it was impossible to estimate the speed of the object, inasmuch as the first distance estimate of the object cast of their course was a matter of conjecture, the duration of the sighting, approximately one minute, would tend to correlate approximate high altitudes with this observed object.

c. Major Gedeon stated that the object displayed an experimental type high intensity rotational aircraft marker, which it is understood could air ballistics experimenting with in lieu of the conventional "flasher" warning lights. Major Gedeon had not observed this type of warning light possibly could account for what Major Gedeon had witnessed. Again, the duration of sighting would tend to argue against this possibility, unless it were being tested on a jet type aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Flying Objects
AREA COUNTRY: United States
DATE OF INFORMATION: 13 February 1952

REPORT BY: Robert E. Hillin, Captain, USAFR
Two Officers, Hq Air Resupply and Communications Service

SUMMARY: (Entire contents summarized in first and summary paragraphs. Line 1-4 of report by AF FORM 112-Part 1)

The following report was made by Captain Ellis M. Woodward, and Major Clifford G. Hoeller, pilot and co-pilot, respectively, of a MATS C-47 aircraft on a local flight from Andrews AFB, Washington, D.C.

a. Bright white object, with no sign of trailing streams of light, became or glowing of characteristics, that at one stage of flight was estimated to be 10 miles it appeared to be traveling at an altitude of 7500 to 8500 feet and seemed to be about 1/6 the size of the full moon. The object was observed to be moving very slowly for a moment but accelerated very rapidly and disappeared to the northwest.
b. Approximately 2 to 3 minutes later, when within 2 to 3 miles ESE of Washington the object appeared to hold its position for approximately 1 minute and then disappeared from sight almost immediately.

1952: The first sighting was made at approximately 2030 hours on 12 February 1952. The object was observed to be about 200 feet in diameter and seemed to come to a stop and then disappear. 

a. The object was observed visually by the two pilots who were flying a MATS C-47 (45936) aircraft at an altitude of 8000 feet.

b. The two observers were between Frederick Airport and Baltimore, Maryland and can be pinpointed on the map, the first time the object seemed to be 8 to 10 miles distant; the second time it seemed to be 15 to 20 miles away.

c. Both observers are experienced pilots with the Air Resupply and Communications Service. In addition, Captain Woodward is an Intelligence Officer.

f. There has been no report of any activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

g. No photographs were taken nor was any physical evidence obtained.

h. No interception or identification action was attempted.

APPENDIX IV
Washington, D.C. Area - 12 February 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 12 February 1952, two USAF pilots flying a C-47 on a local flight observed a bright white object which appeared to be 7,500 ft. and about one-sixth the size of a rising moon.
The object was observed twice. The first time at 2030 EST, the C-47 was between Baltimore and Washington and altitude of 7,500 ft. The object was estimated to be about 3 miles away, very bright and disappeared southwest of Washington, D.C.
The second time the object was observed was at about 2100 EST, the C-47 was south of Baltimore at an altitude of 7,500 ft. The object appeared to approach Washington from the south and east, making a left turn toward the city. When it was within 2-3 miles of Washington, it appeared to hover for about one minute and then it disappeared.
In both instances the object was observed for two or three minutes.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
The description of this incident is very similar to the one reported on 23 December 1951 that proved to be a helicopter carrying experimental lighting.
CONCLUSIONS:
None.

The cold front cloud buildup had been encountered southeast of Pittsburgh, this could not be topped or penetrated due to extreme turbulence. We approached Pittsburgh from the south at approximately 5,000 feet, a brilliant lighted object was seen high to the right (1 o'clock) briefly flying a zig-zag course, then to disappear. This sighting occurred between 0300 and 0315 EST. At first we thought it was an aircraft, however, as the object approached, it showed no change in flame coloration or the object. However, as the object receded, it showed an abrupt change in altitude, in our estimation of the object, this would be impossible for any known aircraft at that time. Both of us thought it was a jet because of the speed, however, neither of us has ever seen a jet maneuver in this manner. The sighting reminded me of buzz-bomb' that I had seen many times in Belgium, however, the buzz-bomb has a stabilising flame which was only a fraction of the size, and was stationary. This object definitely was in excess of five (5) miles from our position. The cloud buildup on our flight at several miles, over which the object flew, and approached from about 15,000 feet, to disappear into the clouds above.
The sky was clear and well illuminated by a bright moon above the clouds. According to continuous observation, this object for approximately one minute prior to disappearance.
We landed at Pittsburgh at 0330 hours.

Captain George F. Arns, H4 47th Bomb Wing, and I were flying a T-11 aircraft, number 41-27498 from Cleveland, Ohio to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia at 5:12 when an unusual flying object was sighted near Pitcairn, Pennsylvania.

A cold front cloud buildup had been encountered southeast of Pittsburgh that could not be topped or penetrated so we changed our flight plan to land at Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

As we approached Pittsburgh from the south at approximately 5,000 feet, a brilliant lighted object was seen high to the right (1 o'clock high), slightly climbing a course parallel to ours. The object was much higher than we were and bright white in color with a continuous, steady glow. It appeared to be smooth and round, and there was no exhaust or trail on fire because of the brilliance and comet-like appearance and yellow to orange color as the object approached. 

At a 3 o'clock high position, regular, one to two second pulsations of the object passed out of sight. Both of us thought it was a jet because of the speed, however, neither of us has ever seen a jet with a pulsation like that. At a lower altitude, the object appeared to be in excess of five (5) miles from our position. This estimate was based on the location of the cloud buildup on our flight and disappeared from sight. The cloud buildup was between 12,000 and 15,000 feet high (estimate).

The sky was clear and well illuminated by a bright moon above the clouds, affording continuous unobstructed observation of the object for approximately one minute prior to disappearing from sight.

We landed at Pittsburgh at 0330 hours.
