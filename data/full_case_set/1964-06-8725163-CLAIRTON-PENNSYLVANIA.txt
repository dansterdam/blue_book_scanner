PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
LOCATION: CLAIRTON, PENNSYLVANIA	DATE: 28 JUN 64
PHOTOGRAPHY:
AF   One negative and 2 prints

1. PURPOSE: This report analyses the photographic work done under Number 68-29 by Major Quintin performed on behalf of the UFO Photographic Evaluation Project. Analysis was conducted by the Photo Analysis Division (PDAD).

2. ANALYSIS: Extremely poor processing resulted in numerous markings on the film. Prints were heavily overexposed and processed, resulting in loss of contrast and detail. The photographic qualities of the image were generally poor, passaing on poor quality image for interpretation.

3. In the absence of a definite object on the negative and print, and the extreme poor qualities of the images, determination of the nature of the image could not be made. The object is dark area across the bottom of the frame could possibly be earth or horizon. The odd shape of the image could be caused if the window condition at the time of exposure were unsatisfactory.

Text from the document:

Dear Sir:

I reference the close up photos may 8, 1964 and am writing to inform the enclosed I received as return photos. I notice immediately recognizing the photos were those that I submitted earlier and I am disappointed as they are poor and somewhat out of focus. The middle portion I notice in the outline were those 3 lights that I said were a strange and moving fairly rapid. At the same time those objects and the outline were very clear and distinct. The middle portion that I notice in the outline were those 3 lights that I said were strange and moving fairly rapid. At the same time those objects and the outline were very clear and distinct. The outline that I notice was of the middle portion was those 3 lights and I notice they were definitely closer to the shape as I had described and as I saw them. The outline that I notice was of the middle portion was those 3 lights and I notice they were definitely closer to the shape as I had described and as I saw them. I think it is unfortunate that the photos were not clearer and more distinct enabling a better judgment of what I saw.
