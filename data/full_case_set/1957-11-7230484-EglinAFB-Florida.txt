THE UNUSUAL FEATURE OF THIS REPORT WAS THE EXTREME SPEED OF THE OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE 3 PLUS OR MINUS 1 THOUSAND KNOTS AT TIMES ON RADAR. LOCATION OF SIGHTING WAS NEAR PENSACOLA FLORIDA. CALL SIGN OF THE STATION TRACKING THIS WAS DEMON-22, STATION COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AT THIS TIME. OBSERVATIONS WERE COINCIDENT WITH TRACK DEMON WAS TRACKING. HOWEVER THE OBJECT WAS APPARENTLY LOST BY RADAR AS IT PASSED OVER HEAD GOING AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED.

RADAR PLOT WAS TERMINATED ABOUT 2330 AND OBSERVATION CHECK CUT THE AREA THE UFOB WAS IN. HOWEVER THE UFOB WAS AIRBORNE AND TRACKED UNTIL APPROX 24 30 PST. THE LAST RADAR SEARCH OF THE AREA FROM 2330 UNTIL APPROX 24 30 REVEALED NOTHING AND IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE UFOB HAD DEPARTED THE AREA.

THE 2-6 MILE AREA OF THE UFOB COULD NOT BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED INASMUCH AS IT WAS APPROX 1-1/2 MILES FROM THE NEAREST RADAR STATION. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICERS MRS. ORIGINAL RADAR RETURN MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY INDIVIDUAL PRECONCEIVED OPINIONS CONCERNING UFOS. UNDERSIGNED SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS WERE NORMAL.

PROBABLE WERE AIRCRAFT WHICH WERE ERRONEOUSLY CORRELATED TO THE 
TARGET PICKED UP BY THE RADAR. IT HERE WERE SEVERAL OF OUR LIAISON 
PILOTS WORKING IN THE AREA WHO WERE TESTING NEAR DRAG CHUTES. THIS COULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE PECULIAR MOVEMENTS SEEN ON RADAR. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY A POSSIBILITY AND IS A GUESS. IT WAS CONTAINED UNTIL THE MORNING OF 5 NOVEMBER 57.
