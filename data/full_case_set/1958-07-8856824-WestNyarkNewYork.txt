I first noticed 2 or 3 objects moving from east to west overhead. They appeared to be silvery in color and elliptical in shape. They seemed to hover or stop momentarily and then continue on. The motion was erratic, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. The long axis in the air was at an angle of about 45 degrees.
