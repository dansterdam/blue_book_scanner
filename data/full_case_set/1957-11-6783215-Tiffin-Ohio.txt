Tiffin, Ohio 
Case 11-6783215
November 6, 1957

On November 6, 1957, at approximately 7:10 pm, the witness, a male resident of Tiffin, Ohio, observed a strange aerial phenomenon in the sky over his home. 

The witness stated that he was outside in his backyard when he noticed a bright, glowing object in the eastern sky. The object appeared to be spherical in shape and was emitting a pulsating light. As the witness observed the object, it began to move slowly across the sky in a northerly direction. 

The witness estimated the size of the object to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. He also reported that the object appeared to have a rod or antenna-like structure extending from it. 

The witness observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared from view behind a tree line. He immediately reported the sighting to the local police department, who in turn notified the United States Air Force.

An investigation was conducted by the Air Force, but no definitive conclusions were reached regarding the identity or origin of the observed object. The case was subsequently classified as an "unidentified" under Project Blue Book.

TIFFIN, OHIO 17 November 1957 HOAX

A science teacher from Tiffin, Ohio observed a flash of light while driving home from school the following day he went to the area where he say the flash. He found an object six to eight feet in diameter on the ground. The teacher contacted the Toledo, Ohio, Police and the item was removed. This information from the Pentagon because of press inquiries regarding the incident.

                  Curtie tale - Affair Case

1. As reported in a letter from Curtie Tale, a civilian, it was stated that on 2 Dec 1957 at about 3:20 PM, while on a hunting trip, he observed a silver colored object which he described as a ³silver sphere², about 30 ft in diameter, hovering about 300 ft above the ground, and that the object made a sound similar to that of a jet aircraft.

2. One copy of DD 1397 dated 9 Dec 1957 forwarded for appropriate action. 

3. Captain Williams, by-direct wire, opined that the report was of no intelligence value, and recommended no further investigation.

4. Belief is that, ballistic - a sighting - a time estimated. With flight path description given, it appears to be similar to previous sightings of weather balloons, a fairly common occurrence.

5. Since all basic information has been covered, this case shall be closed as a routine sighting.
