UNCLASSIFIED

As the result of the emergency landing, four fence posts bent completely 
out of shape, and forty-five feet of fencing badly mangled, torn loose 
and stretched. As the pilot was a civilian, the matter was referred 
to the F. B. I., and a report submitted from San Antonio Field Office 
of that organization indicates the object to have been CHARLES EDWIN 
CARLOW, residing at 1316 Wallace Avenue, Taylor, Texas. The aircraft 
was a Ballanca Monowing, red in color; No. NC 74403. Investigation by 
the F. B. I., indicated nothing unfavorable regarding subject's loyalty 
to the United States.

7. On 6 June 1949, 1st Lieut. VIRGIL H. WILLIAMS, "B" Battery, 
14th AFA Bn., and 2nd Lieut. HAWELL L. JONES, "C" Battery, 14th AFA Bn., 
Camp Hood, Texas, observed aerial light. The observers were at Artillery 
OP No. 2, Camp Hood, Texas, map coordinates C9135-7555-3530. Time of ob-
servation was approximately 2105 hours. Object was in sight for two 
minutes and forty seconds. Object was described as being the size one, 
disintegrated into two smaller discs twelve feet in diameter. Initially was 
2 to 3 miles in a EC Scope. Object was approximately one mile above 
the surface, described as being round emitting a dull glow, orange in 
color, similar to a ball of fire. Object observed through BC Scope,
and initially appeared stationary, then moved in level flight, being 
tracked with constant turn on EC Scope. The object seemed to disinte-
grate into smaller objects which disappeared in a fraction of a second. 
The sky was overcast, but the object was described as being dull as a 
flashlight with slack-out disk. No sound or odor was observed.

8. Same object was observed by Lt. BERNARD C. RAIRIGH, 92nd 
Batt’y, 92d AFA Bn., and Lieut. ALFRED H. JONES, "C" Battery, 92d AFA 
Bn., Camp Hood Texas, from Artillery Observation Post No. 1, Camp Hood, 
Texas, map coordinates 9135-390 - 557700. The second set of observers 
indicated the object to have been one or perhaps two side by side, round 
in shape and yellow or orange in color. Size was about that of a dime 
held at arms length. Observers stated object was fairly dull until 
it burst, and upon bursting part went up and dawn and faded out. OP 
No. 1 observed object on an azimuth of 2640 mils, and OP No. 2 obser-
ved on an azimuth 2771 mils. Report on form "Guide to Investigation, 
Unidentified Aerial Objects" furnished by both sets of observers to 
A/7C through Fourth Army. Copies of these reports are on file in D.O.C. 
No. 10.

9. On 13 June 1949, 1st Lieut. LEE R. CAITTEBARRY, Hq. 92d AFA 
Bn., Camp Hood, Texas, observed aerial light at approximately 2015 hours.
Observer was walking south on 162nd Street, near intersection of Oak 
Avenue, Camp Hood, Texas, and saw one bright light in the sky, the size 
of a flame; described as being round, white in color with a pink trail,

size of a star and the moon, or about the size of an automobile head-
light. It was round with blurred edges and had a yellowish tinge to
its color. Object was more than a mile away and was north-east of the
observers; remained in sight for one or two minutes and moved from
left to right at a slow speed. Its color was dull like a "flashlight
covered by yellow paper". Weather was clear with a light wind from
the south, with a small amount of haze. No optical instruments were
used. Object moved in level flight. Report made directly to AIC by
Fourth Army, and copy retained in files of D. O. No. 10.

5. On 23 May 1919, between the hours 2330 and 0030, three
observers saw a recurring light. Observers were Pvt. HURRAY E.
BIRBAUM, Jr. Hq & Sv. Co., L2 ATR, Camp Hood, Texas; Pvt. MILTON
HENK, "D" Company, L2 ATS, Camp Hood, Texas, and Pvt. IVAN E. FISCHER,
12 BK., Camp Hood, Texas. Object appeared and then reappeared
several times. Described as being the size of a light bulb when held
at arm's length, round in shape, and with a color of that of a light
bulb at a distance. Time of sighting was approximately one minute,
and movement was straight up and down at slow speed. Weather was
clear with southerly winds, and a slight haze. No sound or odor
was observed. No trail noted and no reports seen on object by
observers. Individual reports from each of the three observers fur-
nished AIC by Fourth Army with copy being retained in the files of
D. O. No. 10.

6. On the night of 3 June, 1949, at 2020 hours, a civilian type
aircraft circled Camp Hood at an altitude of from 200 to 500 feet.
At completion of second circling, airplane was headed due east.
Pilot in attempting to land on patrol road which he had mistaken
for an air strip, struck the lid. fence on his restricted area and
caused the plane to crash, but did not burn. Pilot stated he was
enroute from Paris to Taylor, Texas, when his plane developed engine
trouble requiring him to make an emergency landing. The plane was
searched thoroughly and no evidence of cameras or explosives determined.

UNCLASSIFIED     File No. 29-39

As the result of the emergency landing, four fence posts bent completely
out of shape, and forty-five feet of fencing badly mangled, torn loose 
and stretched. As the pilot was a civilian, the matter was referred
to the F. B. I., and a report submitted from San Antonio Field Office
of that organization indicates this individual to have been CHARLES EDWIN
CARLOW, residing at 1316 Wallace Ave., Taylor, Texas. The aircraft
was a Ballanca Monowing, red in color, No. NC 74063. Investigation by
the F. B. I., indicated nothing unfavorable regarding subject's loyalty
to the United States.

     7. On 6 June 1949, 1st Lieut. VIRGIL H. WILLIAMS, "B" Battery,
4th AFA Bn, and 2nd Lieut. HAWLEY L. JONES, "C" Battery, 4th AFA Bn,
Camp Hood, Texas, observed aerial light. The observers were at Artillery
OP No. 2, Camp Hood, Texas, map coordinate 9155-7553. Time of obser-
vation was approximately 2105 hours. Object was in sight for two
minutes and forty seconds. Object was described as being initially one,
dissintegrating into two smaller balls like jet wash in the air. Was
2 to 3 miles in a EC Scope. Object was approximately one mile above
the surface, described as being round emitting a dull glow, changing in
color, similar to a ball of fire. Object observed through BC Scope,
and initially appeared stationary, then moved in level flight, being
tracked with constant turn on BC Scope. The object seemed to disinte-
grate into smaller objects which disappeared in a fraction of a second.
The sky was overcast, but the object was described as being dull as a
flashlight with "slack-out disk." No sound or odor was observed.

     8. Same object was observed by Lt. BERNARD G. RATTERREE, 92d AFA
Btry, 92d AFA Bn, and Lieut. ALFRED H. JOHNS, "C" Battery, 92d AFA
Bn, Camp Hood, Texas, from Artillery Observation Post No. 1, Camp Hood,
Texas, map coordinates 9135-7500-5797.700. The second set of observers
indicated the object to have been one or perhaps two side by side, round
in shape and yellow or orange in color. Size was about that of a dime
held at arms length. Observers stated object was fairly dull until
it burst, and upon bursting parts went up and down and faded out. OP
No. 1 observed object on an azimuth of 2410 mils, and OP No. 2 obser-
ved on an azimuth 2711 mils. Report on form "Guide to Investigation,
Unidentified Aerial Objects" furnished by both sets of observers to 
A/AC through Fourth Army. Copies of these reports are on file in D.O.C.
No. 10.

     9. On 13 June 1949, 1st Lieut. LEE R. GAITHER, Hq., 92d AFA 
Bn, Camp Hood, Texas, observed aerial light at approximately 2015 hours.
Observer was walking south on 162nd Street, near intersection of Ogle
Avenue, Camp Hood, Texas, and saw one bright light in the sky, the size
of a flame; described as being round; whitle in color with a pink trail.

E. PARKER, 6th Medium Tank Battalion, Company, Camp Hood, Texas, 
and PFC JOHN T. OWENS, "C" Company, 6th Medium Tank Battalion, Camp
Hood, Texas, were on duty at Observation Post No. 1, map coordinate
914.0-956.0, and observed one object described as being between the
size of a star and the moon, or about the size of an automobile headlight. It was round with blurred edges and had a yellowish tinge to
its color. Object was more than a mile away and was north-east of the
observers; remained in sight for one or two minutes and moved from
left to right at a slow speed. Its color was dull like a "flashlight
covered by yellow paper". weather was clear with a light wind from
the south, with a small amount of haze, no optical instruments were 
used. Object moved in level flight. Report made directly to AIC by
Fourth Army, and copy retained in files of D. O. No. 10.

5. On 23 May 1949, between the hours 2330 and 0030, three
observers saw a recurring light. Observers were Pvt. HURRAY E.
BIRBAUM, Jr. Hq & Sv. Co., 2 AIB, Camp Hood, Texas; PVT. MILTON 
HENK, "D" Company, 1oz AIB, Camp Hood, Texas, and Pvt. IVAN E. FISCHER,
194th Engr, Camp Hood, Texas. Object appeared and then reappeared
several times. Described as being the size of a light bulb when held 
at arm's length, round in shape, and with a color of that of a light
bulb at a distance. Time of sighting was approximately one minute,
and movement was straight up and down at slow speed. Weather was
clear with southerly winds, and a slight haze. No sound or odor 
was observed. No trail noted and no emissions seen on object by
observers. Individual reports from each of the three observers furnished AIC by Fourth Army with copy being retained in the files of
D. O. No. 10.

6. On the night of 3 June 1949, at 2020 hours, a civilian type
aircrfat circled Camp Hood at an altitude of from 200 to 300 feet.
At completion of second circling, airplane was headed due east.
Pilot in attempting to land on patrol road which he had mistaken
for an air strip, struck the lid, fence on his restricted area and
caused the plane to crash, but did not burn. Pilot stated he was
enroute from Paris to Taylor, Texas, when his plane developed engine
