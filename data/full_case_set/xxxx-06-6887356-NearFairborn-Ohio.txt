The image does not contain a photograph. It is a typed memo for the record regarding a UFO observation on June 11, 1968 near Fairborn, Ohio. The memo describes the object as a "black spot, a way up from bottom of sun and a little to the left" that was "comparison to sun, it was like a D.B. ton wash tub" and "seemed to be moving (flutter)" when observed.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

"The photosphere is as far into the sun as we can see. There, where the photosphere leaves off, is only a luminously of our own atmosphere equivalent to 0.3 millimeters of helium at the surface of the sun, continuing upward in various layers until the chromospheric region is reached. Even in this region the density of the atmosphere is not over 7,000 kilometers. The sun has been pouring out energy at the rate of about 25 million kilowatts per square meter of its surface for several billion years."

"The nature of the photospheric average appears 2700 F or greater. This is somewhat higher than the center of the disc, where the temperature is estimated to 5800 F near the solar surface where the emergent radiation is greatest. Thus the temperature of the solar atmosphere increases to higher levels on the average as the sun is inspected at higher and higher altitudes."

"The bridged general surface of the sun. They are indistinguishable from the bright normal surface of the sun, except that the edges appear darker in contrast with the brighter parts surrounding them. They are often confused with sunspots, but are really only shadowy indistinctions in the bright surface as observed from a distance."

THE SUN POST ITS SPOTS

It mentions that a group of objects were observed at around sunrise on February 25, 1952, near Fairborn, Ohio. The objects were described as disc-shaped and appeared to shrink and disappear. One of the largest groups ever recorded (Fig. 10-5) appeared early in the morning and lasted until around 8 a.m. The text provides a detailed description of the observed phenomena.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing descriptive text without any visual elements.

As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

A bright samlight group. The direction of the sun's position is shown by the shadow as it falls in the lower foreground. The relative motion is one of the salient features of about it's own characteristics. 

10-5. The sun's position is shown by the gradual movement of the shadow as time goes on. This gives some idea as to the position of the object, etc. It became apparent that this was not the usual case of an observation of blinking lights where the object did not move in any direction. The object therefore changed its position appreciably with respect to the observer and this was continuous movement over a period of at least two weeks as the object was under observation. The final disappearance of the sun occurred in late August and became more southerly and upward in a more westerly direction each day, until finally it was lost to sight in September. The movement of the object under observation was direct upward movement toward a point in the heavens midway between Polaris and Vega.
