SAPOICC/Turnure/vs/79079/240 act 87
OCT 23 1967
Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],
This replies to your telephone query to this office on 23 October 1967 concerning the close approach to the V#\ter air force Base on the nights of 21-22 and 22-23 October.
A. Check by the United States Air Force reveals that the base was supporting a rather sizeable Army exercise on very little sleep. Personnel worked around the clock for minutes throughout these two nights. Some of them perhaps took the infrequent looks at UFOs they had seen during the exercise maneuvers as something more involved, but an extensive investigation revealed that they had no other reliable information . There were no known incidents of any unidentified flying objects on those dates .
The information identified your confidential flying .subjects .
Sincerely,
DAVID F. STILES, MAJOR, USAF

Evaluation should be changed to "Insufficient Information".-
Besides this is another one witness case! Further, 117 was not
whole thing seems unreliable. eg. "10 feet diameter held at arm's
length!"
Finally, reported by a 20 yr. old lad. Gross lack of information

Re: Denver Co... case 31/6/67

Examination of photographs taken at the "landing site" (Denver Co... case) reveal no unusual features worthy of special comment. The sighting apparently was of the usual "typical" U.F.O. type and seems to require no further investigation. 

Friendly,
