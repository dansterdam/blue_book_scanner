Subject: SIGHTING OF UNUSUAL OBJECTS IN THE SKY
1. At approximately 2315 hrs on 27 Feb 56 Mrs. Cora Bales and her son, Clyde Bales, residents of Frederick, Oklahoma, reported seeing two unusual bright lights in the sky over their home. The objects were first observed about 2310 hrs and were in sight for approximately 5 minutes.
2. Mrs. Bales reported that she and her son were sitting in their living room when they noticed two extremely bright lights in the sky to the south. These lights appeared to be round and almost stationary. They had a brilliant bluish-white color and appeared to be much larger and brighter than ordinary aircraft lights. The objects did not blink or move appreciably during the time they were observed.
3. After watching the objects for several minutes, Mrs. Bales and her son went outside to get a better look. They continued to observe the objects from the yard for a few more minutes, then the objects suddenly disappeared, seeming to go out rather than to move away.
4. Mrs. Bales stated that she and her son were unable to determine the exact size, distance or altitude of the objects. She said that she had never seen anything like them before and that she was unable to liken them to any conventional aircraft.
5. No other observers of the incident have been reported. Headquarters 29th Air Division was notified of the sighting.

SUBJECT: Late receipt of UFO reports.

1. This batch of six (6) UFO reports submitted under the cover letters by the Armed Forces Air Intelligence Service were received from the ATIC reference "UGDA Project File," latter dated 26 December 1956, subject: "UFO REPORTS."

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest, to almost one year (December 1955) for the newest. It appears that the UFO and "psychological" type reports for more inexplicit reasons before taking 10-14 months to reach ATIC.

4. The very late dates of receipt make investigations or conclusions analysis difficult, as the possibility of a satisfactory clarification of each and entered in UFO files.
