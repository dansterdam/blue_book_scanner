Statement of Witness

I do make the following statement concerning certain unidentified objects observed by me on 11 May 1952:

1. One of the 3 objects that I observed resembled a paper plate in shape and appearance and was of a flat white color. The other 2 were high-speed objects luminous and of a size similar to the first one. One of the smaller objects was not continually visible but appeared to be momentarily lost to sight and then would reappear. The 3 objects were moving in a circular orbit and were occasionally obscured by light cumulus clouds. The objects remaining visible appeared to be in a holding pattern for a few minutes and then the larger one turned to the south and the 2 smaller objects again darted to the north and then returned to the orbit of the larger object until the record observation.

2. I made the two observations at 1229 and 1236. The first observation lasted 1 minute and the second one lasted 1 minute.

3. I observed the objects from the ground with the naked eye.

4. At the start the objects were located in the east and slowly drifted to the west where they appeared to be disappearing when the observation ended. The location over which I observed the objects was approximately 5 miles west of this base. The direction of sighting was from southeast to northwest. When I first sighted it I immediately called for others to observe and they hastened with me to the location. After executing a 90 degree turn to the right, its altitude was estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The estimated speed was 600-700 mph. The objects appeared to be rotating as they flew, and they were generally 33,000 and 44,000 feet high.

5. I have a pilot school education as a flying instructor.

6. Weather was clear, with good visibility and little wind in the vicinity. 

7. No special activity or condition which might account for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the observation was apparent.

9. No interception or identification action taken at the time.

10. No aircraft in the vicinity at the time of observation.

Memorandum for Record
SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952

On 17 May 1952, Major Vincent Voirath, Wing Intelligence Officer at George AFB, Calif., contacted Major Voirath who revised sightings and plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 20 May 1952.

On 21 May 1952, Major Voirath was contacted again and further revision of plans was made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 22 May 1952.

The T-6, during previous observations, was considered unsuitable for the mission and plans were made to utilize a better aircraft. Both the Ground Control Intercept and the Fighter Interceptor Squadron of ADC contacted and briefed on the sightings and plans to observe from a T-6. They agreed to stand by all afternoon on 22 May. The object was sighted. If it was, F-86's would be scrambled and made attempts to pick-up the ground vision and a ground observer with Major Voirath to track the object. 

At 1930 PDST, the T-6 was airborne and had a Loran with a 135 mm camera. The observation team called the F-86's and stated they were observing the object through a telescope and it appeared to be a balloon. Also it was identified to several of the previous reports as the object seen on the ground watching. The aerial search was broken off and the T-6 landed.

It was concluded that the object was this balloon.

On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It will be noted that although some of the reports were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.

Lt Rappelt returned to W-F AFB on 23 May.
The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.

APPENDIX VI
George AFB, Calif. - 1, 2, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
The sighting on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of line sightings there in a three-week period. These sightings were made by military personnel.

a. 1 May 1952, 1315 PDST - Disc-shaped objects, flat white in color which gave no glare or reflection were sighted. They were in formation with three in front and two in the rear. The action two darted around in a circular zig-zag manner.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - An unidentified round, silver object was sighted at the height diminishing until it dropped out of sight. 

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Two unidentified objects moving with the speed of a fast jet. They appeared to be a silver metallic color with a dark spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - Object was of a dull color like a thundercloud, changing shape but had no sound or dynamic features.

e. 11 May 1952, 1220 PDST - Object looked like a white paper plate, flipping end over end with an initial speed comparable to a jet although later it reduced its pace.

f. 13 May 1952, 1425 PDST - A single object, appeared round, shiny, metallic which closed or diffused white or silver was observed for thirty minutes.

g. 14 May 1952, 1405 to 1430 PDST - Same description as object sighted on 13 May and by same sources.

h. 20 May 1952, 1425 PDST - A silver-colored, bright, round object was observed for several minutes. Initially the object was stationary but eventually moved over the horizon.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which we are concerned. The balloons cannot account for the strange air objects sighted in cases which are probably balloons.

The text on the image is as follows:

The project monitor of Blue Book went to George AFB to investigate the various reports.
1 May 1952 - Report well documented. No additional information obtained.
9 May 1952, 1020 PDST - A balloon was released from Edwards AFB; 55 minutes prior to sighting.
9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - No known activity which could account for sighting.
9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - No known activity which could account for sighting.
11 May 1952 - Third report in three days from same individual. No additional data.
13 May 1952 - Balloon launched from Edwards AFB at 1340 PDST.
14 May 1952 - No balloon release officially reported.
20 May 1952 - Balloon released from Edwards AFB at 1232 PDST.
III. CONCLUSIONS
a. 1 May 1952 - No Conclusions.
b. 9 May 1952, 1020 PDST - Very probable that the balloon released from Edwards AFB was the object sighted.
c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Very possible that paper was caught in the thermals and erratic flights turned out to be just that.
d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - No conclusions.
e. 11 May 1952 - No conclusions.
f. 13 May 1952 - Probably was balloon released from Edwards AFB, 45 minutes previous.
g. 14 May 1952 - Description fits incident of 13 May so perfectly it is highly probable that the object was a balloon.
h. 20 May 1952 - Balloon released 53 minutes prior to sighting was probably object observed.

Memorandum for Record
SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952
On 17 May 1952, Lt. E. J. Ruppelt called Major Vincent Morath, Wing Intelligence Officer of the 116th Fighter Bomber Wing at George AFB, Calif. Major Morath stated that according to recent sightings of unidentified objects, it was very desirable to send someone from ATIC to George AFB. Lt. Ruppelt had orders cut and departed by commercial air on 20 May 1952 arriving at George AFB later on the evening of the 20th.
On 21 May 1952, Lt. Ruppelt contacted Major Morath who reviewed sightings reported to him since 18 May 1952. Several of these sightings from a T-6 seemed to be representative and plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 21 May.
Lt. Ruppelt, who had piloted the T-6 during previous observations, was considered the best man to pilot the T-6 in this observation. Both the Ground Control Intercept and Fighter Interceptor Squadron of the Air Defense Command were contacted and briefed on the sightings and plans to observe from a T-6. They agreed to attend if all personnel necessary could be mustered.
At 1330 PST, the T-6 was airborne. Lt. Ruppelt had a lens with a 135 mm telephoto lens in case photos could be taken. The ground observation stations were alerted to keep a lookout for the object being observed by the T-6. The serial search was discontinued and the T-6 landed.
It Ruppelt concluded that the object was this balloon.
On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It will be noted that although some of the reports were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.
Lt. Ruppelt returned to W-P AFB on 23 May.
The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.

APPENDIX VI
George AFB, Calif. - 9, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
The sightings on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of sightings where is a three week period. These sightings were all by military personnel.

a. 1 May 1952 - Five round, disc-shaped objects, flat white in color, were sighted. They were in formation with three in front and two in the rear. The latter two darted around in a circular fashion.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - An unidentified round, silver object was sighted visually from the ground and from F-86 aircraft.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Two unidentified objects moving with the apparent or brace at a slow speed. They appeared to be a silver metal color with a dull spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - Object was of a dull color like a thundercloud. It was shaped like an arrowhead but had no known aerodynamic features.

e. 11 May 1952, 1220 PDST - Object looked like a white paper plate, dipping and cross and with an initial speed comparable to a jet. Although later it reduced its pace.

f. 13 May 1952, 1435 PDST - Single object, appeared round, shiny, metallic in high gloss was observed white or silvery, color varying minutely.

g. 14 May 1952, 1405 to 1430 PDST - Same description as object sighted on 13 May and 9 May 1952, same sources.

h. 20 May 1952, 1425 PDST - A silver colored, bright, round object was observed for five minutes. Initially the object was stationary but eventually it moved and faded away.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which we are concerned. These balloons are released irregularly thus accounting for some of the unusual times of sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.

I'll now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text found in the document:

Dear Sir:

I like to tell you about something that happened to me today. It's really quite a story, and I'll bet you'll get a kick out of it. 

Well, as I was coming home from town, I decided to stop off at the old baker's hill in S.F. Just when reaching the top of the hill, I noticed what I thought to be a flying saucer. It looked like a big disk, hovering right up on the side of the hill. It was not too far away to the right of the hill. I got the impression it was making a humming sound, and in what angle I saw it I seemed to be only the side as a bean to me. My binoculars seem to have failed me that day as I could not get them to focus. For some reason I could not focus them to a sharp image. I could not do anything like read any writing or anything like that on the object. It looked like it was some kind of large aluminum object. I could not see any windows or openings of any kind. It just looked like a real shiny aluminum object hovering right up on the side of the hill. I could not do anything else except just watch it. It could only have been about 30 seconds as it all seems to me. It then made a very slight movement over and down to the right and then seemed to just disappear in a flash. It was one of the old school planes with the landing wheels down but it was not moving in the least. It was just hovering there and every contour of that plane was visible. I saw as it was so much nearer and every contour of that plane was visible.

I went upstairs as I live only half a block down the street and I have a big binocular window facing the area where I saw the object. I took my binoculars out not very good but helps to see near objects. I could not find it on a slight gale on the house and could not seem to find the source it was just about 3:25 in daylight saving time. I just knew for about I minute it was there after looking there for quite some time. I never saw anything like it before looking around I could not seem to find any trace of the object. I am very puzzled about the time to the minute. I have been watching the sky every day whenever I got time for it. Well, next thing made me shaky as I said. I am sorry to do it no detailed description is possible in how it looked. 

I came in from the other room and in to our room and started to cook supper, and some I saw I have I left the blind I started down toward the square as I saw him standing on the hill of Fulton St. toward the beach. I think about 5 blocks from here. I did not come across that before hence same as I saw them just coming from the air pretty low at about 350 feet and lying down to about 75 feet. They did not seem to be moving but hovered right there it seems like no power at all from the roar. I could not seem to find any flash from exhaust or anything. The wind was blowing from the ocean beach toward city center. I have the wind was blowing from the ocean beach toward city center. I have the big binoculars too and this flying object flew towards the beach the slowed down to nearly no speed at all at the church. Dark no visible power. I am often seen but have no more detail I want to give.

The text in the document reads:

At the birds around here they are Nongus, pigeons and small birds and they are flapping the wings the same as the eagles who are just withwith the wind on straight wings without flapping. These birds seem to have the ability of locking their wings and floating. One of the birds that just a moment ago it flapped its wings every so often now just floats with wings extended as though it had no more control over the wings of what seemed to be for balance. Can now see the birds that has feathers falling off the edges of wings as it is lifted one wing to turn like this. It did not have a possibility to turn like this as of before. It did not have a lifting tail it is just floating and if no wind was blowing merely float without moving at all.

Some reckless people on the beach are watching the operation with wings flapping at the indent. To some it is most startling. They too will probably say it is unbelievable to see but I still should say they have a perfect right to say they see what they observe for this is all very strange and I am sorry not having a camera to prove it all but these poor old eyes have to record it all as a memory picture which is not the same as a photograph.

Now I wonder what did I really see? Did I see something nobody else saw? And I can hardly believe it myself. I watched the flying birds for about an hour and I found their maneuvers strange and I could not make out just what made them act so. The birds was from the earth without a "flop". The birds must have been at least a thousand feet and I have never seen birds that does not have to flap their wings against wind. I hope you will believe me as I am very interested in what is in the outer space and I would not want any to think that I saw anything unless it was of importance for the scientists or whoever is in charge of these divisions.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Text from the document:

Dear Lieutenant,

This letter was written to announce the findings of the N.I.C.A.P. which is having difficulty in establishing the location and findings of the aerial object which was seen on May 3rd. 

The investigation was carried out by a special team and this work was very extensive in order to gather all necessary facts and data. I assure you that any information will be furnished in due time.

It transpires that the object was seen at 1932 on May 3rd and from its luminous appearance and behavior, it appears that the object was an unconventional type of aircraft. While its direction and velocity were not accurately measured, the apparent size, color, and luminosity were sufficiently defined for the purposes of identification.

I decided to go to Wylie, a town up the highway, to investigate here in this area. I was on another mission before and still am not satisfied that I wanted to go into this matter which seems very confusing. Nothing seemed to fit into the picture. Nothing seemed accurate and I would hesitate to say anything concrete until all details are investigated.

Transcribed text:

Rather these objects came down and went up again so suddenly that it seemed as if they were meant for some purpose. They would completely disappear and reappear in other parts of the sky. They seemed to have a definite pattern in their motions, though varying greatly in speed from mere hovering or drifting to very fast motions. It is only after careful study of all available the facts that I am convinced there is something strange about them in regards to anything I have seen before. I have come to the very real conviction that these things are not of this earth. It is about 9 years now since I first got into it and I have studied a lot of reports, taking care not to be influenced by other peoples ideas concerning the earth in all fields to try to eliminate any preconceived theories. This is not an easy thing to admit but I feel that to set the facts behind it all but it is all there to be had by anyone interested and willing to take the time to study it.

Radio likes to advance, not to do the most obvious change, at this time the reduction process has begun and they have not moved at present, it is all still, and the light on could be most misleading, by am sure you will not say to my friend as they believe it can still be advancing and old and they believe the sight will be destroyed by all means. it is just that it is more believable in looking into it and all the more they are studying on it and everything is becoming more definite that it is all out for some reason to be seen. I believe I have certain the case and here it is. This does not mean you can do anything more is to study it carefully where it went and maybe on open night air matters for the years. So don't give me more to simply it thoroughly made on open mind.

Dear Sir,

This is to notify you of a report in regard to an observation of an unidentified flying object, which occurred on May 29th, 1952 near George AFB in California.

The event was reported by two reliable observers. They both stated that they observed a bright red-orange object in the sky for more than fifteen minutes, which moved silently at high speeds. The object would disappear and then reappear, exhibiting rapid changes in direction and altitude.

Both observers are considered reliable, and neither could provide an explanation for what they observed. They felt it was important to report the incident, as they were unable to identify the nature of the object.

Normally, I would not have reported this incident, but in view of the reliability of the observers and the unusual nature of the observation, I felt it should be brought to your attention.

If you require any additional information, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Perhaps there is some thing or some interest that may be of military value in one day and if it is a military secret I suggest that this material be properly handled or classified for that purpose. There is some thing here that appears unusual and perhaps worthy of some investigation, although I do not act on for the benefit of any person or organization, I stand to want to serve the public good and expect nothing in return. I am trying to serve the purpose of the Air Force to the best of my ability as a civilian having had experience of over 18 years in the 9/6/52 - 38307/1 and in what I believe to be regular investigations that have not been too thorough in the past and I would guess that there are a number of cases that have not been as completely checked as this one appears to have been. Whatever the seriousness or importance of this sighting, I have no doubt that there is some thing here that should receive more attention than it has in the past. I mentioned "unusual" and a "complete" investigation, - perhaps this is not the outstanding case of its type, but from the details given, it would appear to be a strange report that should not be dismissed as "insufficient evidence" as has been done in the past on similar sightings.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"What it may have been known is a matter of opinion. The unknown object gave a brilliant blue white light and was observed to travel at a very high rate of speed across the sky. The object was observed for several minutes and was seen to disappear in the distance. It was observed by several air force personnel and seemed to be at an altitude of several thousand feet. The object appeared to be quite large in size and was observed to be traveling in a straight line. The object did not make any sound and did not seem to be attached to any visible aircraft. The object was observed on the evening of 6 May 1952 at approximately 2000 hours. That it seems could it not quite belong in our atmosphere, yet it was there."

Chicago, 3/18/52

It has been approximately a week since I last contacted Bluebook regarding the sighting of a strange object over George AFB, California on 5-6-52. I have not as yet received any further response or information from you. The incident was reported through channels on that date, with a request for any information or investigation that could be conducted.

Curious as to whether any follow-up has been made, and if you have any details concerning the matter. This was an unusual sighting, and one which merits further inquiry. Please advise what, if any, action has been taken.

Thank you for your attention to this request. I would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, as I am most anxious to learn what progress, if any, has been made in this investigation.

Sincerely yours,

"as being in the middle of it, one would pass by the light and not be able to see or feel it. It seemed to be a metallic light that gave off an intense heat that melted everything it came in contact with. The metal wreckage was still hot, and had to be handled with care.

Because the object was over water its shape could not be determined. The movements could be watched, but it was impossible to get close enough to determine its size. The object was watched for about three hours, and was very brilliant, giving off an intense light. It seemed to hover for a while, then descend swiftly, only to rise again with great rapidity. I don't think anyone would believe the tale, but the earth's atmosphere is constantly changing, and so there may be other things we cannot see.

Well, this was the main interest in the Bathtub Ranch - not the lights in the sky. I should not have mentioned that the complaint was not of an investigation made in 1944, and only a personal impression."

Transcribed text:

Received from Captain F. R. Brown, USAF, at Roswell, New Mexico, a strange message-like document, enclosed herewith, concerning angels or celestial beings. The document describes the visitation of several such celestial beings to a ranch, the "Holy Spirit" as they refer to themselves, and their pronouncements and warnings. According to the document, these celestial beings have been visiting the earth periodically and are known as the "Angels of Revelation".

ANGEL, is being a messenger of God. How many forms in his Bible are mentioned, we cannot tell. The angels mentioned, if quite at home here on the earth, as the document would indicate, and if we are assured they are "good angels", there is no need of alarm. But the document is confusing and uncertain. For the present, we can only marvel at this strange communication, which seems to be either a hoax, a delusion, or something beyond our present understanding. More investigation is needed.

CO.LD EXISTE THE CITY PROPOUNDED BY A RECENT REPORT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED, and impossible to tell from stated write up whether sighting a natural phenomena or actually a UFO .
THEY DID REPORT ON THEIR INVESTIGATION, AND STATED THAT THE MILITARY OFFICER AND CIVILIAN OBSERVERS WHO MADE INITIAL REPORT WERE CONVINCED THAT WHAT THEY SAW WAS SOME FORM OF UNUSUAL AND UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL VEHICLE. HOWEVER, OFFICIAL CONCLUSION WAS THAT SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY DUE TO REFLECTION OR REFRACTION EFFECT IN ATMOSPHERE, POSSIBLY FROM A DISTANT PHENOMENON NOT RELATED TO ANY OBJECT IN IMMEDIATE AREA. FOR 2000 INCIDENTS AND MORE OF SIMILAR REPORTS RECEIVED, AND MOST CONCLUDED AS NATURAL CAUSES .
AT ANY RATE, THE EVIDENCE AND DETAILS IN THESE CASES ARE STILL CONSIDERED BY THEM TO BE INADEQUATE TO SUBSTANTIATE EXISTENCE OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, AND THAT VERY LITTLE, IF ANY, SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN STUDY OF THIS TYPE OF PHENOMENA. COULD BE THAT SUBSTANTIATION OF ICBM IS A LITTLE MORE ESTABLISHED IN THE FACTS RECEIVED.

Transcript of the text in the document:

This is a great big step in the right direction for the Air Force.  I am a great believer in the capability of our intelligence service and the technical personnel to gather the facts and then to evaluate them objectively.  We must, however, be very careful not to overlook any pertinent data and not to let preconceived notions or the clamor of publicity influence our analysis.  A scientific attitude has never before been more necessary.  Our responsibility is not alone to the Air Force, but to the public as well.  We must explain our findings in a way that will assure the public that we are facing the problem realistically and objectively.  I feel sure that such an approach will lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon and much more rapid progress toward an eventual solution.  To achieve this we must have the cooperation of every organization, official or private, which is investigating the so-called "flying saucers". All too often in the past, the various groups have worked at cross-purposes.  Now we must pull together in a united effort, for the sake of the Air Force and the public as a whole.  I feel that the public is entitled to know the results of our investigations, as they are citizens of the United States and owners of the Air Force, and in no small measure, owners of the technical resources being utilized.  They have a right to be assured that their interests are being safeguarded and that their tax money is being spent wisely and efficiently.  If we can gain the confidence of the public, we will have gone a long way toward solving the problem.  Time and again in the past year, the public has been disturbed by rumors of startling developments and strange sightings.  They are entitled to the facts.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"There is no photo. These people did not make one. They say my notes are not of good quality, but the notes were written at the time and seemed important enough to send. The object was of metallic appearance and disk-shaped. It was seen for several minutes and was generally out of the ordinary, but there is no photo. Also they apparently ground out a vehicle and let a rotor down - this may have been some sort of device to gain speed or altitude. The object did not come close enough to identify details or determine size. There are no small pieces or remains as the object apparently flew off intact. I saw it and a number of others saw it, but they were not considered competent witnesses. There may be certain objects which are far beyond our present understanding of physics and technology."

The text in the document is as follows:

"They called it Unidentified. It was about the size of a basketball and looked like a bright light. The witness who called me reported that the object as it passed through the sky, suddenly increased in speed, and then levelled off at a high altitude. The witness felt that the object was under intelligent control and that it appeared to be descending. However, at a certain point, it suddenly increased in speed and left the area at a tremendous speed, climbing out of sight. The witness reported that the object was sighted for about 10 minutes and was observed through 10x50 binoculars. The witness indicated that the object moved through the sky in a straight line with no sounds and no visible means of propulsion. The witness was able to describe the object in detail and said it was definitely not a meteorite, an aircraft, or any known object. The witness has had considerable experience observing this type of phenomena and feels that the object was definitely some kind of unidentified flying object. More information on something like this would be appreciated.

As you realize and have said, many of these cases are very difficult to explain and we must be open minded about the possibility that they represent something new and unexplained. Serious consideration should be given to this case and any further information or investigation that it may warrant."

The text in the document is as follows:

Sighting of object in fire, which was described as coming from the east first seen by I over California near George AFB. The object was seen on Benitez Street by ground observer when it was near the ground. Other military personnel also saw the object as it passed over the base. The object had the appearance of a perfect quarter sphere and was bright in color and moving at a high rate of speed. It passed from east to west parallel to the ground and then in a slightly upward direction and out of sight. No sound was heard. The object traveled about 8 miles in approximately 6-8 seconds. This sighting was reported to the Air Defense Command and the information was passed on to Project Blue Book at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio.

Text from the document:

"When a light of object observed, first felt that it must be a star or planet, but its movements and strange disappearance caused interest and curiosity. This was not a star or planet, and could not have been an aircraft, balloon, etc. Its movements were such that it could not be explained in ordinary terms.

The object was first observed about 7:30 pm, Pacific Standard time, on May 6, 1952, at George AFB, California. It was approximately 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon in the northeast.

The object was bright and appeared to be stationary for a period of time, then suddenly disappeared, only to reappear a short distance away. This process was repeated several times, with the object finally disappearing completely. Its motions were unlike anything I have ever seen before.

The object was observed by several people, including Capt. J---- B----, the Operations Officer, and other officers and airmen. All were in agreement as to what was observed.

I feel that this occurrence is worthy of investigation, as it could not be explained in ordinary terms, and may have some significance in relation to the general problem of unidentified flying objects."

Transcribed text from the document:

The object observed was apparently a large plane or airplane descending at a very steep angle. This was very puzzling, since there was no air base or airfield nearby, and a noise like a jet aircraft was heard. There was only a brief sighting, lasting only a few seconds. When the object passed behind some trees, it was lost from view and no further observations were made.

MATT, 17, JR.
Could not be identified. Could only be regarded as a more or less unusual check, and a rather unsatisfactory explanation of the incident, and a note comes out of the incident saying "This is my personal opinion - here it is."

Why would any of your reports be highly prized as they were not well to trying to secure them as mere confirmation, things all the time. Here is an extra ordinary event worth a enquiry.

Unless we greatly tighten up our system, or get might not have some out of it and talked away, very simple the situation.

The object seen appeared to be cigar-shaped and luminous. It was slightly hazy or blurred in appearance. The object was first observed at approximately 10:30 PM, 6 May 1952, and was observed for approximately 30 minutes. It was at an estimated altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet and appeared to be traveling in a southeasterly direction.

The object was observed to stop for a brief period and then resume its flight at a slightly higher altitude. During the time it was observed, the object appeared to change direction slightly several times. It was observed to disappear after approximately 30 minutes.

I obtained a detailed description of the object from the USAF observers. The object was a luminous white or off-white color, cigar-shaped, and approximately 40 to 60 feet in length. It was slightly hazy or blurred in appearance.

LOCATION: 34°52'N 117°06'W

The object was first observed approximately 10 miles southwest of George AFB and was observed to travel approximately 25 to 30 miles in a southeasterly direction before disappearing.

I. REPORT OF OCCURRENCE:
On 3 May 1952 at about 2300 hours, local time, a Capt. L. Hoover, navigator at George AFB, Victorville, California, observed an unidentified flying object on that date.

2. I was at the time in my car on the flight line of the base airport, looking at the stars, when I noticed an object moving rapidly across the sky from southwest to northeast. It appeared to be about 40 feet long and approximately 8 feet wide, and to be traveling at a very high rate of speed, estimated at 500 to 700 mph.

3. I watched the object for about 15 seconds as it crossed the entire sky, and then it disappeared from view. It made no sound and left no trail. I could not estimate the altitude, but it appeared to be at a high altitude.

4. I do not know what the object was, but it was definitely not an aircraft, balloon, or any other identifiable object that I have ever seen. I am certain that it was an unidentified flying object.

5. I am the only witness of this occurrence.

Statement of Observer

1. The single object that I observed appeared to be a full-color, brilliant light. It seemed to be moving like an airplane, but was difficult to determine because of the fast speed. It seemed on several occasions to be moving like an airplane, but was difficult to determine because of the fast speed. It seemed on several occasions to be zig-zagging or oscillating, and the size was difficult to determine. I estimate the size to have been from 2,000 to 2,500 feet in diameter. I heard no sound from the object.

2. I saw the object at 1750 hours on the date indicated. It was in sight for about 15 seconds.

3. Observation was made by naked eye from the ground.

4. I was on the east side of George Air Force Base when I sighted the object. It was vertically overhead and proceeded southward at 25,000 to 28,000 feet altitude.

5. I have a high school education and am taking instruction in civilian flying.

6. Visibility was good, skies were clear and there was little wind in the area.

7. There were no special conditions, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

Memorandum for Record
SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952

On 17 May 1952, Lt Ruppelt, called Major Vincent Valrath, Wing Intelligence Officer at George AFB, Calif. Major Valrath stated that some sightings of unidentified flying objects had been made at George AFB. It was decided to send one man from ATIC to George AFB. Lt Ruppelt had orders out and departed by commercial air on 20 May 1952, arriving at George AFB late on the evening of the 20th.

On 21 May 1952, Lt Ruppelt contacted Major Valrath who reviewed the sightings from a T-6 airplane. Several T-6 pilots had observed a strange object in the sky. Plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 21 May.

Lt Meiser, who had piloted the T-6, during previous observations was contacted. He stated that P.M. and Lt Ruppelt had observed a bright object which they couldn't identify as an airplane, balloon, or astronomical phenomenon. Both ground control and air control of the flights scrambled and observed the object. They agreed to stand by all afternoon on 21 May. F-86's would be scrambled and radar would attempt a pick-up. A ground station and around observer were added by Major Valrath with a genuine VHF net and would have a better chance of detecting the object. However, the object was not seen and no further sightings occurred.

At 1330 PDST, the T-6 was airborne. Lt Ruppelt had a 16 mm camera with a 135 mm telephoto lens in case photos could be taken. At 1420 PDST, the ground observer notified the control tower that they had a target on the radar screen coming in from the west and proceeding south. The target was followed and observed through the previous reports as high as 30,000 feet. The aerial search was discontinued due to the loss of the target and the T-6 landed.

The Ruppelt team then contacted the Commanding General of the 831st Air Division at George AFB and was informed that a 1235 PDST a 80 ft balloon from their station (approximately 75,000 - 80,000 cubic feet of helium) had been released with a sonobuoy attached.

It was concluded that the object was this balloon.

On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It was still be noted that although some of the incidents were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.

Lt Ruppelt returned to W-P AFB on 23 May.

The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.

The image appears to contain a photograph, but it is not visible in the provided screenshot. The text in the document describes several sightings of unidentified objects observed on May 8, 9, and 13, 1952 at George AFB, California. The descriptions include details about the shapes, colors, and behaviors of the objects, such as disc-shaped, flat, white in color, moving in a circular or zig-zag pattern, and an unidentified round, silver object observed on May 9. The document also mentions that only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately, and that these balloons are the only ones with which the sightings can be associated in some cases.

APPENDIX VI 
George AFB, Calif. - 9, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
The sightings on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of the sightings there in a three week period. These sightings were all by military personnel. 

1. 1 May 1952 - 2300 PDST - Two or three round, disc-shaped objects, flat white in color, which gave no reflection, were observed by tower personnel. These objects appeared to be of very high speed, much faster than jet aircraft, and maneuvered in a circular zig-zag manner. 
2. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - An unidentified round, silver object was launched vertically from the ground and from this rose to about 50,000 feet in 10 seconds, and then was observed to remain stationary. 
3. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Two unidentified objects moving with the current or breeze appeared to be hollow, disk-shaped. They appeared to be silvery in color with a dark spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare.
4. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - Object was of dull color like a thundercloud. It was shaped like an arrowhead but had no known aerodynamic features.
5. 13 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Object looked like a white paper plate dipping and over end with an initial speed comparable to a jet although later it reduced speed.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which the sightings can be associated. These balloons are released regularly thus accounting for some of the unusual sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text from the document is as follows:

The project monitor of Blue Book went to George AFB to investigate the various reports.

a. 1 May 1952 - Report well documented. No additional information obtained.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - A balloon was released from Edwards AFB, 55 minutes prior to this sighting.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - No known activity which could account for sighting.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - No known activity which could account for sighting.

e. 11 May 1952 - Third report in three days from same individual. No activity to account for.

f. 13 May 1952 - Balloon launched from Edwards AFB at 1340 PDST.

g. 14 May 1952 - No balloon release officially reported.

h. 20 May 1952 - Balloon released from Edwards AFB at 1332 PDST.

III. CONCLUSIONS

a. 1 May 1952 - No Conclusions.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - Very probable that the balloon released from Edwards AFB was the object sighted.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Very possible that paper was caught in the thermals and swept along as it was climbing, turned out to be just that.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - No conclusions.

e. 11 May 1952 - No conclusions.

f. 13 May 1952 - Probably was balloon released from Edwards AFB, 45 minutes previous.

g. 14 May 1952 - Description so perfectly it is highly probable that the object was a balloon.

h. 20 May 1952 - Balloon released 53 minutes prior to sighting was probably object observed.

Head T: Letters/Ltr 8 May 1952 - no air base shown do - Headquarters, USAF, Washington, DC, Subject: Unidentified Aerial Objects.

1. Reference is made to a letter dated 2 May 1952 from Hamilton Air Force Base, California, concerning Unidentified Aerial Objects observed near that base. 

2. The object as described in the referenced letter was photographed as it approached the base on 6 May 1952, the photograph being attached. According to the information furnished, the object appeared to be circular in shape, about the size of a medium bomber, and was traveling at a very high speed. The object was observed to make a steep climb and then level off and travel in a horizontal direction.

3. As the object is described as having been photographed, a print of the photograph should be forwarded to this headquarters for evaluation. The failure to include the photograph with the referenced letter rendered the report incomplete.

4. It is requested that any similar reports of Unidentified Aerial Objects, whether photographed or not, be forwarded to this headquarters as soon as possible.

5. A careful evaluation of all data received on Unidentified Aerial Objects is being made in this headquarters, and your continued cooperation in this matter is requested.

STATEMENT OF WITNESS

1. The two (2) objects that I observed were of a silvery, metal color with a dark spot at the center, and, at certain angles to the sun, they gave off a bright, glistening effect which appeared much as a kite in the air. They were moving with the air currents or shown at fixed positions as they appeared to hover.

2. The objects were observed by me at 1230 hours on the date given. I kept them in my sight for 4 minutes.

3. I sighted these objects from the surface with the naked eye. I am the Intelligence Officer of the 146th Fighter-Bomber Wing.

4. At the time that I saw the objects, the weather was clear and hot, with good visibility prevailing.

5. I am the Intelligence Officer of the 146th Fighter-Bomber Wing.

6. There was no activity, meteorological or otherwise, which might have accounted for the sightings.

7. There was no physical evidence of the sightings.

8. There was no interruption of aircraft radio communication or identification.

146TH FIGHTER-BOMBER WING
GEORGE AIR FORCE BASE
Victorville, California

14 May 1952

Statement of Observer:

1. One of the 3 objects (that I observed) resembled a paper plate in shape and its surface was of a metallic color. The others were too high to allow any accurate estimate as to shape or size but had a metallic glistening. One of the smaller objects was not continuously visible because it seemed to waver or "wobble". As it turned, the sun's reflection on its surface could be seen. The other two smaller objects were continuously visible, the smaller one disappearing and reappearing in the paper plate's flipped end over end in a definite direction, disappearing from sight about 5 minutes later at a reduced speed.

2. I made the two sightings at 1225 and 1226. The first observation lasted 1 minute and the second one around 3 minutes.

3. I observed the objects from the ground with the naked eye.

4. I was at the central part of George Air Force Base when I made the observations. George Air Force Base is located 4 miles northwest of Victorville, California. The larger objects moved in a northwesterly direction. The smaller one, on the second time, it was moving east approaching me and then headed south after approaching to within 10,000 and 15,000 feet. The two smaller objects did not move in any direction constantly but in the same general vicinity. They were between 20,000 and 25,000 feet high.

5. I have a high school education and am taking instruction as a civilian light aircraft pilot.

6. Weather was clear, with good visibility and little wind in the vicinity.

7. No special activity or condition which might account for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the observation was apparent.

9. No interception or identification action taken.

10. No aircraft in the air in the vicinity at the time of observation.

STATEMENT OF G. SMITH

Group:. I wish to make the following statement concerning observations made by observers:

1. The flight of the objects appeared to me to be erratic, like that of balloons or smoke. They were first observed in the west and moved in an easterly direction. They moved at varying speeds and in a random manner. Their color appeared to be light.

2. I sighted the objects at approximately 1945 hours and I saw them for approximately 15 to 20 seconds.

3. I spotted the objects from a tower which is about twenty (20) feet high. I was unable to make a close estimate of the objects with binoculars as they disappeared from view.

4. I sighted the objects from the tower of the small arms firing range. They moved in a southerly direction at an altitude estimated to be between 10 and 20 thousand feet.

5. I am nineteen (19) years old, an air policeman at George Air Force Base. In civilian life I worked as a mechanic. I completed the 10th grade at school and am married.

6. At the time that I sighted the objects the sky was clear and there was absolutely no wind.

2. The object was round and small and appeared to be very far away. The color was whitish like a fluorescent light or the sun. It made no sound and seemed to be in a steady flight. At one time the object seemed to turn on its side and then became normal again. It was looking at the object and it was almost directly overhead when it disappeared. The object disappeared very fast, almost like a light being turned off. It must have gone straight up.

3. Time sighted: 1425 to 1455 13 May 52.
Time observed - 30 minutes.

4. Visual observation from the air. Speed 150 mph. Altitude 10,530 ft.

5. I was sitting in the rear seat of the aircraft north of George AFB. The object was out in front of us. The aircraft was in a flight east to west and west to east. It appeared to be above us. It was a little north of us. The aircraft I was in was at least 20,000 feet below the object.

6. The weather was very clear - no clouds and a slight haze below.

7. The object might have been from Muroc Air Force Base.

8. None.

9. We went as high as we could in our aircraft.

On 6 May 1952, at approximately 2050 hours, a Northrop F-86A jet aircraft, piloted by Lt. LESTER L. WAGNER, 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, was scrambled from George AEB, California, to investigate a reported unidentified flying object. The object was observed for approximately 25 minutes, during which time the aircraft was unable to make visual contact with it.

DETAILS:

At approximately 2050 hours, on 6 May 1952, the radar controller at George AFB observed an unidentified target on his scope, 10 to 15 miles west-northwest of the base, traveling at an estimated speed of 400 to 500 knots. This target was at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. The controller immediately contacted the 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and requested that an aircraft be scrambled to investigate the target.

Lt. LESTER L. WAGNER, piloting an F-86A jet aircraft, was scrambled and proceeded to the reported location of the unidentified target. Lt. WAGNER was in radio contact with the radar controller and was vectored towards the target. However, despite extensive maneuvering, Lt. WAGNER was unable to make visual contact with the object. The target was observed on radar for approximately 25 minutes, during which time it maintained a relatively steady course and altitude. The object then disappeared from the radar scope.

Lt. WAGNER reported that he was unable to detect any exhaust trail, navigation lights, or other identifying characteristics of the target. He further stated that the object appeared to be metallic in nature and was traveling at a speed far exceeding the performance capabilities of any known aircraft.

The report concludes with no further details or analysis.
