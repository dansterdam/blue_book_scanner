MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, LEGISLATIVE LIAISON, OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS / MAJOR ALLAN J. HILL
SUBJECT: Letter from C/M Pucinski
Pucinski's draft of a suggested reply to Congressman Pucinski with reference his letters from Mr. ___ ____ ___ ___ is sent for your concurrence.
A search of the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center's UFO files reveals no case reported for Illinois on 4 November 1957, nor is there a case for the area on the 3rd or 5th of November 1957.
The case referenced as taking place on 19 July 1958 actually occurred on 20 July 1958. The object was sighted in the Crystal Lake area of Illinois and was identified by the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center analyst as a balloon. The description of the object, position of the sun, and wind vector substantiate this conclusion.
This sighting took place during the month of November 1957 which recorded more UFO sightings than most years. (See attached press release.)

There has considerable correspondence with Mr. — —

that the Joint Army-Navy-Air Force publication #SR is out of print

his office where he can read and copy this publication in whole or
in part.

His request for Army publications should, of course, be
directed to the Department of the Army and Mr. — — should be
informed that classified documents are not available.

REPLY TO AFOIN-4-22

SUBJECT: UFO Letter - Congressman R. C. Pucinski

TO: SAFOI-3X (Major Tacker)

1. A search of the ATIC UFO files reveals no case reported for Illinois on 4 November 1957. However, there is there is a case on the 3rd or 5th of November 1957 that could be the one to which you referred to as the points of the object, position of the sun, and wind vector substantiate the conclusions that the sighting was probably a balloon with a parachute closure moving along in the wind.

2. The case referenced as taking place on 29 July 1959 actually occurred on 20 July 1959. The description of the observation substantiates the conclusion that the object, position of the sun, and wind vector were the characteristics which moved the object in the observed manner, accounting for the relatively short duration of the sighting.
