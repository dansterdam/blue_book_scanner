The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a sighting report form. The form contains various fields such as date, time group, location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation, and conclusion. The conclusion states "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION" and provides some details about the sighting, including that the objects were observed just after dusk and were large star-like objects.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Text extracted from the document:

The witness stated that she was about to turn in for the night around 9:00 pm on the evening of May 6, 1965 when she noticed a bright light outside her home located on Strawberry Lane, Lynn, Massachusetts. The light was hovering over the nearby woods, approximately 150 feet above the ground. The witness described the object as disc-shaped and silver in color, with a bright, rotating red light on the bottom. 

The witness watched the object for several minutes before it suddenly shot straight up into the sky at an incredible speed and disappeared from sight. The witness was very shaken by the experience and reported the incident to the local authorities immediately afterwards.

MIAUTEER COPY OF REPORTS
CASE HISTORY OF INVESTIGATI0*

26 MAY 1965

U.F.O.

My following report is based on information received from an interview with Mr. John Dearborn of 16 Moulton St., Lynn, Mass. on May 24, 1965.

On the evening of May 23, 1965, at approximately 9:35 P.M., Mr. Dearborn was driving home from work along Rt. 1A in Lynn, Mass. As he approached the intersection of Rt. 1A and Moulton St., he noticed a strange lighted object in the sky slightly to the south of the intersection. This object was approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter, round or spherical in shape, and was hovering silently approximately 100 to 150 feet above the ground. The object was giving off a bright white light which seemed to pulsate or throb. There were also colored lights, red and green, flashing on the periphery of the object.

Mr. Dearborn stopped his car and watched the object for approximately 2 minutes. During this time, the object moved slowly to the northeast, remaining at the same altitude. It then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight in a northeasterly direction.

Mr. Dearborn is certain that this was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any other type of conventional flying object. He has had considerable experience in observing aircraft and is familiar with their normal flight characteristics. This object moved and behaved in a manner unlike any aircraft he has ever seen.

Significantly, it apparently contains a highly redacted portion, as indicated by the blacked-out area towards the bottom of the page.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now attempt to transcribe all the visible text from the document:
