The observer sighted an object that looked like a metallic baseball with a circle around it. One side was a little different than the other, but failed to respond to our request. The observer indicated that the object's movement was very sluggish and appeared to be on hydrails electric circuit. It is the view of the investigator that this sighting is psychological in nature.

Dear sir:
The letter shown above is in regards to a sighting of an unidentified flying object. The object was seen moving across the sky and was estimated to be between 40-50 feet in diameter. The object was observed for approximately 15 seconds to 1-2 minutes, moving in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 12,000 miles per hour. No sound was heard. The object had bluish-white lights around the perimeter and a reddish-orange light in the center. After reaching a certain distance, the object disappeared from view. The witness stated that this was the first time they had ever seen such an object and was quite concerned and interested in what it could have been.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report

1. At approximately 9:00 p.m. on 12 March 1968, Mr. James H. Wiggins, a resident of Wiggins, Mississippi, reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the vicinity of his home.

2. According to Mr. Wiggins, the object was circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and emitted a bright, pulsating light. Mr. Wiggins stated that the object hovered silently approximately 100 feet above the ground for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

3. Mr. Wiggins provided a rough sketch of the object, which is attached to this report. No other physical evidence or corroborating witnesses were reported.

4. This incident was investigated by the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book. The object was classified as "Unidentified" due to the lack of additional information or evidence.

Text extracted from the document:

Dear Sir: 

I was of the opinion that my previous letter had been lost or misplaced and have since made inquiry at the local post office as to its whereabouts, but have received no reply as of this writing. Therefore, I am taking the liberty of enclosing a copy of that letter for your information and consideration.

As you will note therein, I reported sighting of an unusual aerial phenomena on the night of March 4, 1968, at approximately 8:15 P.M. The object, which was brightly illuminated, appeared to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and seemed to be hovering or moving slowly over the area. It was observed for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes before disappearing from sight.

There were several other witnesses to this phenomenon, and I would be pleased to furnish the names of those persons should you desire to contact them for further information. At the time of the sighting, I was in the company of my wife and several neighbors, all of whom can attest to the facts as I have presented them.

I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this communication and any information you may be able to provide concerning the results of your investigation, if any, into this matter. 

Sincerely yours,

Redacted

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or letter discussing a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Dear Sir:

There is a letter of unknown date which states that on Jan 29, 1968, at about 4:30 p.m., an unknown object was observed flying above at a high altitude. It was described as having a metallic appearance and reflecting sunlight. The object was viewed for several minutes by a number of observers, and its movements indicated it was under intelligent control. The middle layer is said to be brighter than the ends. The bottom layers are thinner than the top. It appears to have been stationary and observable to the naked eye at the time of observance. The names of the observers are redacted from the text.

The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. The sketch appears to depict a circular object with some additional markings or annotations around it. However, there is no further context or information provided about the nature or purpose of this sketch within the Project Blue Book report.

This document does not appear to contain any textual content beyond the handwritten sketch. The entire page is taken up by the hand-drawn diagram, and there is no discernible printed or typed text present.

Text from the document:

Dear Sir:

There is a lot of talk about the Air Force doing away with civilian reporting of UFO's. This is not true - at least not completely true. The Air Force wants the public to continue reporting UFO's and will continue to investigate all reports. Briefly, here is what the new UFO reporting procedures will be:

1. All UFO reports will be handled through local law enforcement agencies. When a citizen observes a UFO, he should report it to the local police. The police will then notify the nearest Air Force base, which will dispatch an investigator to interview the witness. This will save the Air Force a lot of time and effort in tracking down witnesses.

2. The name and address of the witness will be kept confidential upon request. This should encourage more people to report UFO sightings without fear of publicity or ridicule.

3. There will be no more public Project Blue Book reports. All UFO data will be classified as "confidential" and handled on a need-to-know basis within the Air Force and other government agencies. Public release of this data will be very limited.

So, in summary, the Air Force wants the public to continue reporting UFO observations, but through a new procedure utilizing local law enforcement. This should result in more complete investigations and better data for analysis.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or illustration. It depicts an oval shape with some additional lines and markings around it. There is no photograph present in this image.

Here is the text from the document, as transcribed by an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system:

"The object was at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet and was visible for a period of about 10-15 minutes. It was oval in shape, silent, and made no abrupt maneuvers. The object appeared to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed by 3 persons, 2 adults and 1 child. The object was observed through a 8x binocular and appeared to be metallic in color."

This image contains two illustrations. The first illustration is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels such as N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, and NE. The second illustration appears to depict two landscapes - one with a person standing in the foreground against a hilly background, and another with a distant, mountainous landscape.
