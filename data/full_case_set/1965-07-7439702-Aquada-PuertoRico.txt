The text on the page reads as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

1. Reference the attached unidentified object report from
Wash D C 20330. The sighting as depicted in his letter was noted on the film.

2. The duration of the flight, within the immediate vicinity of his observations, was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. No duration for that portion of the flight which was observed beyond his line of sight was indicated. It is possible that a helicopter from Ramey AFB was operating in the area at the time. No data was presented to indicate that the sighting could not have been an aircraft (helicopter).

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text describing an observation of an object that appeared in the western horizon, moving toward the north and then south, eventually disappearing. The text mentions the object's size, shape, and color, as well as the time of the observation.

Transcript:

Dear 2nd of the Army
Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen: 

I want to report to you the visual observation I had made on 7/9/65.
At about 10:12 a.m. I noticed a strange object moving low over the trees. It appeared in the western horizon, short to move toward north then made a semi-circle turn & moved to the south disappearing. The time was exactly 10:12 a.m. The object drained the brilliant white to a reddish orange one when it reached maximum constellation exactly in the sky called 21°49°3'. The mass lights there and I noted something that looked as a smaller shower the a the manure.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document describing an unidentified object that the author claims to have seen. The text describes the object as being about two miles in size, and the author expresses uncertainty about whether the objects were satellites or something else. The author mentions that the objects did not seem to be satellites based on their behavior.

Transcription of the text:

"I have seen this object twice in about two months. The size of the object I saw some time ago was big enough and I am afraid they might show any thing I have not discovered yet. The picture I have taken with a 35 mm camera has a good enlargement. But I believe that this might enter the night time or the daytime and might come over my domiciliayed with those objects. 

I know this object was not a satellite because satellites follow a straigh line way more or less described a semi-circle. Satellites don't seem this one doomed and there were no clouds in the area.

For more information, if interested please contact me.

P.D.
This about 5 miles or so from my P.R. 77. So I can't distinguish completely some conditions."
