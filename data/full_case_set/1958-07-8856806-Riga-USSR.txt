USSR
IR-139-58 
The color of the object was metallic gray. It arrived from SE in an oblique flying position and seemed to slow down as it approached the observation point. It hovered there for a moment, then flew off towards SW. It was visible for a period of a few seconds and disappeared behind some trees. The witness immediately went to the spot where the object was last seen but he could find no trace of its having been there. There was an air-raid drill which started at 0930 hrs and ended at 1000 hrs. The witness was curious and asked questions about the UFO after he had seen it. There were no public notations in the newspaper or radio and also no newspaper or radio news publications.
