The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose with labels indicating the cardinal directions and various intermediate directions. The smaller sketches depict lights in the sky, with one labeled "Lights as seen from Newport News, Va." and the other depicting a landscape with lights in the sky.

The object was reported as being a luminous, circular formation that remained stationary in the sky for about 30 minutes. It had a bright, white luminosity and seemed to change in size slightly during the observation period. The object did not make any sound and did not show any abrupt changes in brightness or motion. The reporting individual described the object as approximately the size of a full moon in the sky.
