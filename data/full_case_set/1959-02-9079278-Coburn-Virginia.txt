The text in the document is as follows:

"On the night of february 8, 1959 about 8:50 P.M. while on the way home from work, I saw an unusual light pass over the ridge at tremendous speed. it looked to me like a solid object, large and elliptical, with four lighted or luminous portholes around the edge. I watched this object for around 94 minutes as it traveled on what appeared to be a straight course from northeast to southwest. it made no sound that i could hear. it seemed to be about 500 to 800 feet in altitude and approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile in extent. I kept trying to get a closer look, but it was too high and fast for me to observe in detail. I saw no trail or exhaust of any kind. the light was not blinking and seemed to remain constant throughout the observation. I had a peculiar creepy feeling about the whole thing, but was not frightened. I spoke to several of my friends and neighbors who also observed the object, but they were unable to describe it as well as I did. I have observed a good many aircraft at night, but this was definitely not like any one i have ever seen before. It seemed almost unreal."

STRANGE LIGHTS SEEN IN WISE
Wise, Va., April 18 - Wise County is troubled by "strange lights" in the sky. The lights have been reported flying over the town of Wise and several surrounding communities for the past three nights. 
On the night of April 16, many residents reported seeing the lights, which appeared to be about 2,000 feet high, and movicig at a high rate of speed. The lights were described as orange or reddish in color, and varying in size from small to large. The lights were seen by many people at about 9 p.m.
On the night of April 17, the lights were again seen by numerous residents of Wise and the surrounding areas. The lights were seen moving very rapidly across the sky from north to south, and from east to west. The lights were described as round or oval in shape, and varying in size.
On the night of April 18, the lights were again reported by many people in the area. The lights were seen moving rapidly across the sky, and were described as round or oval in shape, and varying in size from small to large.
The lights have caused much speculation and discussion among the residents of the area, who are unable to identify the source of the lights. Several theories have been advanced, including the possibility that the lights may be from some type of new aircraft. However, no definite conclusions have been reached.

Here is a detailed account of a visual observation of an aerial object that occurred on April 17, 1959 around 10:30 PM near Coburn, Virginia. The observer reported seeing a light that appeared to be round in shape and stationary in the sky. After a few minutes, the light began to move in an erratic manner, making a series of abrupt turns and changes in speed. The light then appeared to split into two separate lights that continued to move in an unusual manner before finally disappearing from view. The observer stated that the lights displayed no visible means of propulsion and made no sound. The entire incident lasted approximately 10-15 minutes.

Here is the text from the document:

One of the first questions which comes to mind is, how did the local astronomy club become interested in these phenomena? When did your firm become interested in these phenomena?

In this particular case, I have been interested for about three years. The first time I learned about the matter was through the newspaper stating that there was going to be a meeting at night of the Cumberland Astronomical Society to discuss the sightings of strange objects in the sky. That was about three months ago.

Have you heard anything about the existence of these objects before three months?

No, I hadn't.

When did you become interested?

About three months ago, through the newspaper announcement of the meeting of the Cumberland Astronomical Society, which stated that they were going to discuss sightings of strange objects in the sky. That piqued my curiosity and I attended the meeting.

The Cumberland Astronomical Society is a community organization open to anyone interested in astronomy. We are now starting work on a four-inch telescope, which will be completed sometime this summer.

How long has this astronomical society been formed?

It was formed during the winter of 1958, so it has been in existence for about four months now.

Did you become interested in this matter at the time you heard about it from the newspaper announcement, or was there some previous interest on your part?

No, this was the first time I had heard of anything like this, and the newspaper announcement was what first interested me in the matter.

I notice in the papers that some people who live in the vicinity of Coburn have reported seeing strange things in the sky recently. Have you seen anything about 10 years?

No, I haven't heard anything about it prior to this year.

There have been people in Coburn who have been seeing something and I was wondering if you had heard anything unusual, anything which they were unable to explain.

Yes, I have been told by a few people in Coburn that there are people in Coburn who have been seeing unidentified flying objects. However, I personally have not seen anything unusual, and there is nothing which I can confirm from my own knowledge.

Thank you very much. That is all the information I need.

So after that, we could see this object, this light, leave the top of the mountain. And then it come back and landed again. Yes, my, it come back and hovered over the same spot and then landed again.

I happened to be doing some reading, and I told my wife about it. There wasn't much conversation after that. All the lights were out, and the children were asleep. I could see the object very plainly from the window, and it seemed to be a large object or not. The only thing we could see was the light, and we couldn't tell exactly what it was.

I believe that the Astronomical Society did receive a letter indicating that a number of different persons had reported seeing this object. And her report stated it was a large object or not, but that they couldn't tell exactly what it was from the observation. The air, we did, one reason we do not feel that the color streams are the same in the objects as we have seen in the past. If they were reflections of lights or something of this nature, they would show many color streams. But this did not occur. So we did not feel that the color streams are the some mechanism as we have seen in the past, which would be a possible reflection of some lights.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The document consists entirely of handwritten text.

I will now produce the output of the text found in the document:

I remember reading in the paper that nine objects were seen in the night. Had any of you see these? 

Yes, we saw them from the Coburn football field. Through field glasses they looked like a red light which would fade to a yellowish light when the back cover was turned.

Do you think they could have been airplanes that you saw that night? Well, they could have been airplanes, because during the past couple of weeks we have been seeing airplanes, there's going in the same direction as the unidentified objects have been going. 

As soon as we have pictures or some of the written material telling more about these objects, we hope will answer the question if some of the objects that have been reported were airplanes.

What have you seen since your first sighting, Mr. _____?

That was all I saw. By the way, you expressed your interest in the size of the objects and that would be my estimate that they were a little larger than about the size of a automobile or a little larger. 

About the size of a station wagon.

Are there any additions to what has been brought out thus far that you all might have seen?

The phenomenon about which many people are excited in Coburn is a light, really an orange light, which radiates out from the top of the mountain. On several occasions this light has seemed dim. It has also seemed to go up and down from the top, silhouetting against the light. 

Was it your guess or to what was found - what would seemed to be stripes or marks or any indications that seemed odd to you that recerds, to be found and marked or characterized in any way?

Here is the text extracted from the document:

That was all it felt like to watch this. By the minuteness of the object being seen, I cannot find any true estimation of its size. If it was to me unknown size, I don't know whether it would be something small or something large - I cannot find out anything like that. 
Yes, there could be some connection between this, since it was found that the mountain was two miles away where the object has been seen. The natural question arises, is there anything else? I understand that you also found some other objects in various areas, with these same types of lights, whatever they are. I do not believe that there is any connection between this and those cases, with those lights being seen in various places. Do you believe that there is?
Yes, it would. The natural question arises, have they been seen before to feel up in the air? Similar to the way they have been seen floating in the air longer? 
As I best remember, the sightings have been made by people of Coburn. We don't know whether they were the sighters or not. There is so much going on down there, that I don't know what to believe. There doesn't seem to be much publicity on this so far.
Have you any further information on this, since all this newspaper publicity? 
Do they seem to be as frequent as they have been?
Not since all the publicity. There haven't been as many sightings. It seems that since we haven't had any sightings of unusual objects since all this, that indicated anything.
He said... I didn't hear a thing.
Anybody else? Do you want to comment at all, huh? Well, we might ask about any future objects that you might that you might have for investigating this thing further.
We plan to continue this until we leave. We will be leaving after this year to go to another college. We plan to continue this until then and probably discuss it further with the students at that college.
Do you plan to try to secure any additional equipment such as telescopes or cameras in order to get more definite coverage on this if anything further develops?

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document discussing the possible varieties of "angel hair" that were observed during March and April 1959 near Coburn, Virginia. According to the text, the Air Force received multiple reports that flying saucers were cruising over the mountains near Coburn, and they regularly used a landing strip on an inaccessible peak of Sheep Rock Mountain. The investigating officers examined some of the material and identified it as a type of "window", which refers to long strips of aluminum foil used by the military in World War II to produce spurious radar echoes and confuse enemy anti-aircraft fire.

The text of the document is as follows:

The possible varieties of angel hair increase with the development of new technologies. During March and April 1959, the Air Force received many reports that flying saucers were cruising over the mountains near Coburn, Virginia, regularly used a landing strip on an inaccessible peak of Sheep Rock Mountain, and frequently dropped angel hair on the nearby countryside. The investigating officers examined some of the material and identified it as a type of "window," the rolls or long strips of aluminum foil used by the military in World War II to produce spurious radar echoes and confuse enemy anti-aircraft fire. The Coburn angel hair was identified with the fall used by Air Force planes carrying out experiments in the area. "Window" falls very slowly, dropped from heights up to 30,000 feet. It may easily be visible for some time to ground observers, as well as interfere with local radar reception (io).

DRAFT  30 NOVEMBER 1959

1. Background.
a. On Wednesday, 27 May 1959, Major Tacker of SAFIS-3 called ARGIN-4E16
and informed Major Friend that Congressman Jennings had contacted SAFIS and
requested information concerning an UFO sighting in Wise-Coeburg, Virginia
area. A check was made of the UFO files and it was found that no reports
had been received from the Wise-Coeburg area. Hqs., 1006th AISS was contacted
and was requested to investigate these sightings. The only available infor-
mation was that received via telephone and newspaper articles received from
Major Tacker. The information in the newspaper articles indicated a large
number of residents in the Wise-Coeburg, Va. area sighted several strange
lights and found strips of aluminum foil on the mountains in the area. (See T.D.)
b. Detachment 8, 1006th AISS was directed to investigate the subject
UFO sightings and contacted ARGIN-4E16. Due to the fact the detachment was
short of personnel, T/Sgt Bolieu of ARGIN-4E16 was directed to assist in
the investigation. Friday, 5 June 1959, T/Sgt Bolieu and A/1c Primacombe 
of Det 8, 1006th AISS departed Wright-Patterson AFB for Wise-Coeburg, Va
area and arrived at Wise, Va. at 2400 on same day.

2. Investigative Efforts.
a. 6 June 1959.
(1) Made an appointment with the Wise County Sheriff for 1315.
The county sheriff, Mrs. __, who is also a waitress, had
very little information concerning the sightings as she had not seen the
objects herself. She stated that she had never heard of a mountain until 
reports of subject sightings reached her.

- page 113 -

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed document or report.

Departed 4122, Va. for Goeburn, Va. Contacted Mr. concerning the objects he had observed.

(Case Tab C) Mr. and his family had been seeing strange lights in the area for a number of years. They drive around almost every night looking for them.

(3) Contacted Mr. of Goeburn, a forest ranger, who Mr. has observed the objects for about a year, hearing noises like a strong wind blowing through power lines.

b. Sunday, 7 June 1959.
(1) Departed Goeburn for Norton, Va. to look around the area.
This area of Virginia has only coal mining industries and there was found to be a large number of coke furnaces burning at all times. They are outdoor furnaces and an orange flame is emitted straight up through the top of the furnaces. They are located around Goeburn.
(2) Returned to Goeburn and contacted Mr. and Mrs. 
They couldn't remember the date of their sighting, but the sighting itself was still vivid in their minds (see Tab C). Their description of the three lights they saw was identical to the railroad right-of-way lights used in this area, except the strange lights were seen through the tops of some trees approximately 100 elevation from eye level. The trees were approximately fifty yards from observers.

c. Monday, 8 June 1959.
(1) Visited the Clinch Valley College located near Wise, Va. However, we could not talk to the individuals concerned with the UFO sightings as they were having an open house party for parents and relatives.

- page 114 -

There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text in the document is as follows:

(2) Guided the investigators up Chesapeake Mountain to the alleged clearing supposedly made by one of the UFOB's. The clearing was reported to have been used during the month of March 1959. By the time the investigators saw it, it had grown up with weeds and the trees had filled out. During the early days of the sighting, it was reported, a large group of people were all over the mountain and had camped in the clearing with camp fires burning. The original reports stated limbs in the outer fringes of the clearing were broken and some brush in the center singed, but by the time the investigators got there, the trees had grown back through trampling all over the clearing and probably breaking trees for firewood. It was impossible to tell if the reports were accurate. As of now, the clearing looks like any clearing found in a forest. The three holes found there have also been filled in.

(3) Visited the XXXX family at their home. There are two young girls in the family and all members of the family claimed to have seen strange lights almost every night. We got a description of one seen by them on the night of 5 April 1959 (see TAS C). Later in the evening the investigators drove out on the road toward St. Paul, Va. with the XXXX family hoping to see some of the lights they claimed to see. The only lights visible were car, house and star lights.

d. Tuesday, 9 June 1959.
(1) Visited Mrs. YYYY of Tacoma, Va. She was reported to have been with the XXXX family on 5 April 1959 (see TAS C).
(2) Drove out to Bull Mountain on the road to St. Paul where Mr. ZZZZ claims to see strange lights. The road winds up through the mountains and there are houses in the valleys, and some on the mountain-side among the trees that cannot be seen during the day.

Transcribed text from the document:

(3) Attended a weekly meeting at the college, held by the Clinch Valley College Astronomy Club. Most of the boys stayed home studying for final examinations; therefore, very little was accomplished. However, we did get a description of a sighting made by Mr. [REDACTED] (see TAB 2).
(1) Drove to Norton, Va. to contact [REDACTED]. He had the picture taken of one of the objects. Also contacted Mr. [REDACTED] for his description of an object sighted by him (see TAB F).
(2) Drove to the Clinch Valley College to contact other members of the astronomical club who had witnessed the objects. Contacted Mr. [REDACTED] and Mr. [REDACTED] (see TAB D).
(3) Contacted [REDACTED], a young boy approximately 10-11 years old, concerning an object he had observed (see TAB E).
(4) Drove back to Coeburn and contacted Mr and Mrs. [REDACTED]. The date of their observation was uncertain (see TAB H).
(5) Drove out toward Clintwood, Va. to Caney Ridge where several strange lights were observed by [REDACTED]. We were with the [REDACTED] and another couple. Reportedly, the lights suddenly showed up. While we were there a bright white flash was observed. One investigator said it was a car, but one of the women claimed it was above the mountain. The investigator pointed out that the mountain in question was fairly hard to distinguish from the dark sky, but she still insisted the light was above the mountain. The investigator was sure he had momentarily caught a glimpse of a red tail light at the same time the white light appeared. He suggested they keep watch to the left of the original sighting, and after about two hours, the lights disappeared.

OCR output:

or three minutes a car could be seen rounding a curve from right to left. Another light was observed which disappeared and then appeared at another location. The investigators thought that that someone had probably gone to bed as it was very late, and some neighbor of the first had come home. This theory was just laughed at. To the investigators, it had the appearance of a distant house light. After watching in other areas, everyone returned home.

f.: Thursday, 11 June 1959:

(1) Drove to Clintwood to contact Mr.   . It was very difficult to locate and when we finally located him, he didn't have very long before going back to school (see TAB E).

(2) Drove to Haysi to contact Mr.    Mr.    did not live in Haysi and investigators had to drive back toward Clintwood. Source lives south of Haysi several miles (see TAB B).

(3) Drove to High Knob which is situated approximately 10 miles southwest of Coeburn. It is a recreation area in a national forest. The trees in this area are thick and tall this time of year, making it impossible to see anywhere but up.

(4) Returned to Coeburn for the evening. At approximately 2300, a Mr.   , a newspaper reporter, visited the investigators and asked for information concerning the sightings. We could not give the information requested and Mr.   was so informed. As he had observed some of the strange lights we asked him for his description (see TAB F).

e.: Friday, 12 June 1959:

(1) Drove to Darwin along Caney Ridge. Contacted several people who live in the area concerning the unusual lights Mr.   claims to have seen. No one in the area had observed anything out of the ordinary.

(2) Talked to several people in Coeburn, including the Coeburn police; no new information could be learned.
b. Saturday, 13 June 1959:
(1) Visited Mr. who lives on the outskirts of Coeburn. Mr. gave a description of two separate sightings (see TARS Case File).
(2) Was visited by Mr. , an Army Reserve 1st Lt and a law student at Baltimore, Md. He had heard of the strange lights and drove to Coeburn to look around. He said he had talked to several people and went out one night with Mr. . He said they saw a light and Mr. Estep declared there were no roads or houses where the light was. Mr. said he went to the area the next day and saw some houses among the trees and some roads in the area where the lights were seen. Mr. said he had been up to the clearing on Sheeprock Mountain and found some ground under the brush that was charred. He was asked if it could have been from the camp fires that had been built there. He had no answer. He told the investigators of two people who saw something during the first of May. After about two hours he left.
it. Sunday, 14 June 1959:
(1) Drove to Toms Creek, Va. to contact the people who were reported to have seen a strange light. All that could be learned was that a woman by the name of saw a momentary light travel across the sky.

He stated that he doesn't put much stock in these sightings. He was reluctant to give the investigators information concerning his sighting, as he thought there was no logical explanation for the lights.

Analysis and conclusions:
A. The metal strips found in several locations surrounding Coeburn, Va. are identical to one type of chaff used for jamming radar.
B. Due to the time lapse of up to three months between the sightings and the investigations, it is rather difficult to draw a valid conclusion as to the nature of the reported sightings. However, it is the considered opinion of the analyst that several things contributed to these sightings:
(1) The presence of a large number of open coke ovens in the area.
(2) The prevailing weather on most of the subject evenings.
(3) The apparent inability of some witnesses to determine when an automobile was traveling along a road located on top of a ridge.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a report from Project Blue Book, containing typed text.

(4) The inexperience of witnesses with the appearance of astronomical bodies when observed under other than normal atmospheric conditions.

(5) The witnesses were out looking for strange lights, and as will always happen, some were observed. They looked so long and hard that they began seeing lights dance around.

(6) The power of suggestion cannot be discounted as being partly responsible for the sightings.

Investigative Report 

19 February 1959

1. Description of incident:
   On 9 February 1959 at approximately 6:55 p.m., Mrs. Coburn of Virginia reported observing two luminous objects in the sky. The objects were described as being circular in shape and emitting a ray of light from their centers which extended vertically. The objects were observed for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing from view. 

2. Investigation and findings:
   Mrs. Coburn's report was investigated by an Air Force representative. No physical evidence was recovered and no corroborating witnesses were identified. The cause of the observed phenomenon could not be determined.

3. Conclusion:
   The case remains unresolved. The objects observed by Mrs. Coburn do not match any known aircraft or natural phenomena. The lack of physical evidence or additional witnesses prevents a definitive explanation from being reached.

REQUEST FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE

On February 9, 1959, Mrs. Coburn, of 28 North Broadway, Coburn, Virginia, telephoned the local police department and requested military assistance. Mrs. Coburn stated that an unidentified flying object had been hovering over her home and that she and her family were frightened. The police department contacted the nearest Air Force base, which in turn notified this office.

Capt. John J. Leber and 1st Lt. Richard W. Thurston were dispatched to the scene to investigate. Upon arrival, they interviewed Mrs. Coburn and learned the following:

At approximately 8:15 p.m., Mrs. Coburn and her family were watching television in their home when they observed a bright light hovering over their house. The object appeared to be round in shape and emitted a pulsating glow. It remained in the area for about 15 minutes before slowly moving away to the southwest. 

Mrs. Coburn stated that she was very frightened and requested military assistance. Capt. Leber and Lt. Thurston conducted a thorough search of the area but were unable to locate the object. They did, however, find numerous neighbors who had also witnessed the strange light.

The case was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation.

Mrs . Coburn's story of a u.f.o. she observed on 2-9-59 is as follows:
At approximately 6:45 a.m. on February 9, 1959, Mrs. Coburn was looking out her bedroom window and observed a round, shiny object hovering above the hills to the east of her home. The object appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter and was a metallic gray color. It hovered silently for about a minute and a half, then suddenly shot straight up out of sight at a tremendous speed. Mrs. Coburn stated that the object appeared to be rotating or revolving as it hovered. She also stated that she had a good view of the object as the sky was clear at the time. The case was investigated by project Blue Book personnel.

FLYING SAUCERS AND
OFFICIAL SECRECY
THE STORY BEHIND THE SECRET PROJECT
'BLUE BOOK' AIR FORCE INVESTIGATION
By EDWIN V. COBURN
In mid-January, 1950, the U. S. Air Force released to the public a partial list of 'flying saucer' sightings made in the past few years. The number of such sightings which had come under official scrutiny exceeded 1,000. This represented merely a fraction of the total number of sightings, as only a small percentage of the reports ever reached the Air Force for investigation.

Behind this official air of secrecy there lies a story of intense interest and deep concern on the part of the Air Force in these unidentified aerial objects. The story has as its setting the hush-hush Project 'Blue Book,' an Air Force investigation of 'flying saucers' which has been in operation for the past several years.

It is now possible to piece together the full story of this Air Force investigation and the philosophies, procedures and conclusions which have marked its progress. The Air Force has approached the problem of 'flying saucers' with a curious mixture of skepticism and diligence, secrecy and openness.

A careful study of the available information on the 'Blue Book' project indicates that the Air Force has been both impressed and puzzled by the number and consistency of the 'saucer' reports which have come to its attention. This does not mean that the Air Force has come to any definite conclusions about the nature and origin of these mysterious objects.

What it does mean is that the Air Force, while officially taking a 'show me' attitude toward reports of 'flying saucers,' nevertheless has made a serious and continuing effort to investigate the phenomenon. The Blue Book project, operating under the direction of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, has examined hundreds of individual sightings and has arrived at some tentative - and in many cases conflicting - conclusions.

So great has been the flood of 'flying saucer' reports that the Air Force has felt compelled to maintain a special project to investigate them. At the peak of the 'flap' in 1952, the Air Force was receiving an average of 35 to 40 reports per month - a far cry from the handful of reports recorded in the early days of 1947.

Some of the reports have been so well documented and so puzzling that the Air Force has been forced to the conclusion that not all of the sightings can be dismissed as hallucinations, hoaxes or misidentifications of known objects.

This does not mean that the Air Force has decided that 'flying saucers' are interplanetary spaceships. Indeed, some of the more prosaic explanations offered for the phenomenon have been given serious consideration by the Blue Book project.

But the accumulated evidence is such that the Air Force cannot ignore the problem. So it continues to investigate each new 'saucer' report with the same diligence that it would apply to any other intelligence problem of potential military importance.

Subject: Unusual Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects
Location: Coburn, Virginia

On 7 February 1959, Mrs. Virginia Smith of Coburn, Virginia, reported the sighting of several unusual flying objects in the sky over her home. Mrs. Smith stated that at approximately 8:15 PM, she observed three bright lights moving rapidly across the sky in a westerly direction. The objects were described as round in shape and emitting a bright, bluish-white glow. They were silently traveling at an estimated speed of 500-700 mph and disappeared from view within 30 seconds.

Mrs. Smith immediately notified the local authorities, who in turn contacted the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book for investigation. An Air Force investigator was dispatched to interview Mrs. Smith and examine the site. No physical evidence or residue was found, and no other witnesses to the event could be located. The case was classified as "unknown" due to the lack of corroborating evidence.

This is to tell the story of the light in the sky observed by Mr. M. V. coburn and other people at his home in Virginia on the night of February 5, 1959.

At about 8:45 PM on that date, Mr. Coburn and his family were in their home when they observed a bright light moving in the sky. It seemed to be hovering at times and changing directions. Several other people in the neighborhood also observed the light.

Mr. Coburn and his family watched the light for about half an hour. During this time, the light seemed to be coming closer and then moving away again. The light appeared to be very bright, like a welding arc, and was estimated to be about the size of a basketball.

After about half an hour, the light disappeared from view. Neither Mr. Coburn nor the other witnesses were able to determine what the light was or where it came from.

Transcribed text:

My name is George Coburn, 41 Main Street, South Boston, Mass., and I'm writing this report on what I observed on the evening of February 6, 1959.

At about 7:30 PM I was alone, looking out the east window of my home, when I saw what appeared to be a large object coming from the northwest, traveling in an easterly direction at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be flat and circular in shape, and had a diameter of approximately 100 feet. It had no visible means of propulsion and made no sound. The object had a series of lights around its perimeter, and the center appeared to be illuminated.

The object passed directly over my house at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet, and then proceeded to disappear from sight in the southeast direction. The entire sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.

I am a serious observer of such phenomena, and I can assure you that what I saw was not an airplane, satellite, or any other known aerial device. I am convinced that what I witnessed was an unidentified flying object of some kind.
