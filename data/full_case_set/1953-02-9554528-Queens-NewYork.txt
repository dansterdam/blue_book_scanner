DETAILS:

1. AS of 1943 hours on 23 February 1953, Agent LOUIS G. HENDERSHOTT, this district, received information from an individual that he had observed an unidentified object in the skies over Bayside, New York, at approximately 0130 hours 23 February 1953. He advised that he could see no markings on the object. 

AT NEW YORK, NEW YORK

- On 24 February 1953, Agent HENDERSON interviewed a witness at this office on the 18th floor of 67 Broad Street, New York City. This witness, who did not wish to be identified, stated that he had observed the same object the previous day. The description of the object is as follows:

SHAPE - no recognizable shape was described. Inasmuch as the object was considerable distance, this description is understandable.

SIZE - Size of the object was estimated by the witness to be three (3) or four (4) times the size of the star "Polaris".

COLOR - The witness described the color as being an off-yellow with an orange tinge and very brilliant, about three (3) or four (4) times brighter than what is normally seen of the star "Polaris".

NATURE - Only one object was observed.

DYNAMIC FEATURES - Because of the fact that he only observed a light, could not determine if any aerodynamic features, nor did he see any trail, exhaust, or propulsion system connected with this unidentified flying object.

SPEED - Subject did not linger, nor could he estimate the speed of the object. However, he did state that it appeared to travel at a very rapid rate.

SOUND - No sound was heard.

MANEUVERS - The object appeared to travel horizontally in a very low area, covering sixty (60) degrees of angular traverse during the time it was observed. The object is traveling through one sky, almost came to a stop near the zenith, and then proceeded to descend, disappearing below the horizon after approximately one half of the total time observed. After descending, it appeared to instantaneously hover and then start again on the same course. After disappearance, it did not reappear or come back within the vision of the witness.

MANNER OF DISAPPEARANCE - The witness stated that the light blinked out and was not seen again.

The text of the document is as follows:

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

INITIAL INQUIRY: This is an initial report.

A person at 0120 to 0125 hours, 23 February 1953, observed a yellow-orange tinged brilliant light at an altitude between 10-15 degrees above the horizon, approximately the size of a star. Its apparent motion indicated a downward path descending in angle from about 20 degrees to approximately 10 degrees, remaining in view for approximately 15 seconds. It apparently instantaneously disappeared. Maneuver, during travel, appeared to be accelerating descent, and there was no sound.

(2) between 0120 and 0125 hours on 23 February 1953, and he observed the "unidentified flying object" for approximately five (5) minutes.

He added that he had first observed the unidentified object from the corner of his home while walking to his car. The object was hovering on 67th avenue in Rego Park, Queens, and had immediately stopped his car, dismounted, and stood outside to observe the object.

The document states that the location of his sighting was at the time of the observation was at the intersection of 67th avenue and 98th street in Rego Park, Queens, New York, where he is estimated to have observed the object for 75 degrees to the right at a distance of approximately 1/2 mile.

The report further stated that due to the time of the observation, no other individuals were noticed as witnesses, and he did not notice any other individuals in the flight. It was stated that he had had past experience in observing aircraft, and that this object was "not familiar as any known aircraft".

The report concludes by stating that the individual was employed in the advertising branch of the Promotion Department of True Magazine, and that he had submitted this article concerning "flying saucers" published in the magazine, and that he was interested in determining the nature of these objects.
