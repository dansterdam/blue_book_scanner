Dear sirs:  Subject object between 6:10 and 6:30 p.m. was observed by several civilians beneath it. The general opinion was that the object appeared to be a bell-shaped craft about 50 feet in diameter and which appeared to be a maneuverable thing with fast movements on the part of the craft. The opinion is that it was not an aircraft but apparently some type of air vehicle which has not heretofore been reported. This observation was made over Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana, on the evening of 8 September 1959. This organization believes this observation to be of importance and therefore, it is being submitted for your information and further study if warranted. Any information concerning this observation would be greatly appreciated.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

Master Sergeant was notified on 8 November 1959 that a UFO had been sighted in the vicinity of the Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana. The object was first observed at approximately 1820 hours local time by airman First Class Wilson, stationed at the base. The object was described as round, white in color, and approximately the size of a basketball. It was observed for approximately 5 to 10 minutes as it traversed the sky in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. Wilson reported that the object made no sound and exhibited no apparent exhaust or propulsion system. He stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control.

When interviewed, Wilson appeared sincere and believable. He was adamant in his description of the object and stated that he had never seen anything like it before. No other witnesses were located, and the object was not picked up on the base's radar. A thorough search of the area revealed no evidence that could explain the sighting.
