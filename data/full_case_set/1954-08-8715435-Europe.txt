SUBJECT: (U) Analysis of Material Allegedly From "Flying Saucers"

1. In accordance with established ATIC and Air Force policies for the study and evaluation of unidentified aerial objects, request that attached specimens be examined and a report be made to this office.
2. The metallic specimens appear to be a form of iron-nickel-cobalt alloy, which may be of meteoritic origin. The glass containing magnetic particles is of an unusual nature and it cannot be determined whether organic or inorganic composition.
3. Special Investigator, W/Sgt. O.D. Hill, obtained the specimens Saturday afternoon, 15 Oct 1956.
A brief background surrounding these specimens should be of some assistance in initiating a study of the items, and so indicate reasons why this seemingly unusual material was submitted. 
The subject specimens were submitted by an individual who is the head of one of the largest civilian UFO investigation organizations in the country. Certain claims have been made by this self-appointed UFO investigator, and his claims have been repeatedly published in various flying saucer publications.
He has a large following of flying saucer adherents, is editor of two UFO publications, appears to be a close friend of both known and unknown flying saucer writers. This individual has had a considerable amount of publicity through the UFO/SAUCIR medium.
The persons who allegedly found these specimens were a stone quarry in the suburbs of Cincinnati (Norwood-Madeira area.) The specimens are said to have been found in the quarry and small fragments were mailed to this individual in Cincinnati. The investigator was told that it was "air" in the quarry where the specimens were found.
The individual submitting these metallic fragments claimed that he submitted them to the University of Cincinnati for examination, and it was found that they were NOT of meteoric origin.

DF COMMENT /1 to AFOIN-4E26
SUBJECT: (C) Analysis of Material Allegedly from "Flying Saucers".

1. "Angel's-hair". This odd term requires some explanation to those unscientists who are now giving this term some publicity. "Angel's-hair" purports to be the solidified or propulsive by-product of some unknown flying machine or "saucer" which, according to the "Paniter's Theory", so-called, after the French officer who published this in the military, progresses with a pulsing, vibrating motion transforming it into nuclear, thermal, thenco kinetic energy. 

2. In August of this year, the staff of TV Hour, among others, gave this so-called "angel's-hair" nationwide attention in a science fiction drama whereby the substance is shown vanishing before the eyes of ATIC chiefs.

h. The investigator in this case reports that upon surveying the area in question he found a small amount of this substance in the street near the individual's residence, and is dissolved in the handle.

FOREIGN UFO SIGHTINGS

The information presented below are reports of UFO sightings in foreign countries. The information was extracted from various intelligence reports and are all filed in the ATIC repository under listed.

1. In compliance with your request, laboratory examinations of 4 metal samples and a textile thread purported to be "angel hair" have been made at White Stork.

2. The following results are submitted to your offices:

a. Metal Samples:
All four samples were found to be ferro-chromium and magnetic and not radioactive. The composition obtained spectrographically for these samples was:
Chromium 67 - 71 percent
Silicon 0.1 - 1.0 percent
Ni, Co, & Mn 0.2 percent
Fe, Ca, & Al 0.5 percent
Balance

The crystalline structure and non-oxidized condition of these samples points directly to the fact that a high-temperature such as would be encountered by certain meteoritic origin has not been imposed. Both the common appearance and the analysis of these samples strongly suggest that they were cast from the same mold or steel foundry where chromium is customarily added to steel melts of this form.

b. Textile Sample:
The sample purported to be "angel hair," reportedly a volatile by-product of the fuel used in "flying saucers," was given both chemical and microscopic tests, and it is (in all probability ferron), a material commonly used in the U.S. which was very probably a synthetic textile after exposure to air for 72 hours in the Air Weapon Materials Branch did volatilize.

3. A formal report was not requested from White Stork. Rough draft memoranda from White Stork are attached hereto, and the samples which are man made are returned herewith.

MEMORANDUM

The chemical samples submitted were examined specifically for their copper, nickel, and other metallic content. All trace elements determined were 0.1-1.0 per cent. Nickel, cobalt, and manganese were less than 0.1 per cent, and magnesium, calcium, and aluminum were less than 0.05 per cent.

The samples appear to be low-carbon, low-silicon ferrotitanium. 

In this sample, chromium runs 57-71 per cent.

Text from the document:

"TO: DATO (INFORMATION ONLY)

SOURCE: FLYING SAUCER MAGAZINE, 4/47, 4/55, 1415

LINCOLN, NEBRASKA

A LARGE WHITE OBJECT, ESTIMATED TO BE A JET, MOVING FAST BEHIND A ROW OF TREES. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A SILVERY WHITE, ABOUT 1600 FEET AND TRAILING SMOKE. IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRAIGHT PATH ABOUT HALF THE TIME BEHIND THE TREES. THEN SUDDENLY IT REVERSED COURSE AND SHOT UPWARD VERY FAST, DISAPPEARING IN ABOUT 4 OR 5 SECONDS.

IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS LIGHT HAD APPEARED, A SECOND LIGHT APPEARED, SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE FIRST LIGHT. THIS LIGHT HOVERED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN DISAPPEARED DOWN TO HALF ITS INITIAL ALTITUDE. AT THIS POINT IT SEEMED TO DIVE IT AND DISAPPEAR IN A SHALLOW CLIMB. THEN ANGLING UPWARD AGAIN, REPEATING THIS SEVERAL TIMES WITHIN ANOTHER 4 OR 5 SECONDS. I HEARD NO NOISE FROM IT.

ASSUMING THERE MIGHT BE A SPECIES OF FLYING SAUCERS OR TROUBLEMAKER, THE FIRST LIGHT I OBSERVED WAS PROBABLY THAT. I PERSONALLY NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE, THE SECOND LIGHT I SAW COULD BE MERELY SOME SORT OF PRIVATE PLANE ABOUT 20 FEET LONG, FLYING DOWN TO ABOUT 10 FEET INTO THE CENTER OF THE BACK YARD, THEN GOING DOWN AGAIN, THEN RAISING AWAY - MAKING TO 200 FEET (OR MORE) AND APPEARING TO KEEP THE DISTANCE OF A CITY BLOCK, WITHIN THE SPACE OF SECONDS. BEFORE FINALLY DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW."
