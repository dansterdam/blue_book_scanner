35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

On the night of October 7, 1967, between approximately 9:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., I observed a very bright object in the sky moving rapidly from east to west. The object appeared to be roughly circular in shape and was extremely bright, emitting a white light. It moved at a steady pace, maintaining a constant altitude, and made no sound that I could detect. The object was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from my view. I was unable to determine the altitude or actual size of the object, but it appeared to be quite large and at a considerable distance. There were no other witnesses to this sighting, as I was the only person outside at the time. I have no explanation for what I observed, and I am submitting this report in the hope that it may be of interest to your investigation.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch depicting an aerial observation scenario. The sketch shows a curved horizon line with various angle markings, and a compass illustration. There are instructions in the text prompting the reader to imagine a scenario and make sketches to depict the motion and direction of an observed object.

Text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.
90°
75° 
60°
45°
30°
15° 
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

TACT/UFO (Maj. Quintanilla/70915/jaf/11 Oct 67)  
UFO Observation  

Plainfield, Ind. 46168  
Reference your letter of 9 Oct 1967. Thank you for bringing these cases to the attention of the Air Force, however, because these cases occurred so long ago, and cannot properly investigated, I can give no further consideration to this report. In the future similar sightings should occur, the nearest Air Force Installation should be immediately contacted so that a complete investigation can be made.  

Sincerely,
HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF  
Chief, Project Blue Book

Gentlemen:
Please have this sighting on our file. Some of the data we, cant substantiate.

1. Sighting on Oct. 6, at approximately 10:00 to 10:30 p.m. near Marblehead, Ohio. A group of four people were driving a car. While driving, they observed at high altitude four large bright object moving in a westerly direction at a high rate of speed. [Redacted] They were driving another car 1/2 mile behind them, and the persons in this car also observed the objects. There were approximately fifteen seconds between the two sightings which, they believe, showed the same objects.  It was like a flight of geese, and there were four objects in "V" formation. It was estimated the objects were operating at a speed of approximately 5,000 mph. The objects were observed for about 15 to 20 seconds.

[Redacted] how that can be some credence to the report as the persons who [Redacted] and [Redacted] were of high caliber, intelligent and, we believe, not the type to make up stories. [Redacted].

Project Notification: Oct 7, 1967

- page 59 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation.

The text of the document is as follows:

The sighting was very brief, but he feels it was most definite, and not something imagined. He did not believe more than one person saw it, and the brightness of the object was very outstanding. It was seen high in the sky to the north, and was round or circular in shape, and was very bright, brighter than a star or planet. It was seen for a few seconds only, and then suddenly appeared to speed away and disappear from sight. He was unable to determine the size, distance, or elevation of the object, but it seemed to be very high up, and was moving at a very high rate of speed when it disappeared from view. He stated that the object was not a star, planet, airplane, or any other known object, and he is convinced that it was a genuine UFO sighting. He had never seen anything like it before.

MAJOR QUINTELLA D.-GORDON
           REPORT OF UFO SIGHTING
October 15, 1967
Octotbsr 16, 1967 - 1920 am EDT, eastbound on US 30 Highway 93 W of Guernsey Ohio, driving towards Marblehead. At about 12 miles west of Sandusky Ohio I noticed a light in the sky to the north & south. Slight haze in Arkansas R - Valley. As I watched, the light seemed to increase in size and then decrease slightly. It was driving west towards Sandusky and a few miles west of me. I watched it for about 5-10 minutes. The light seemed to be oscillating or fluttering somewhat. Occasionally it appeared to be reddish in color. But slightly left of the center was a rectangular flame like object. This seemed to rotate or oscillate back and forth but slightly left of the center. The outer rim appeared to be encircled or ringed by a greenish fire. The entire object appeared to be hovering or hanging in the sky. It did not appear to move quickly as some reports indicate. In fact, at times it appeared to be stationary. Because of its rotation and oscillation it may have given a moving impression at times. As it approached it maintained a remarkably constant elevation. It was slightly lower than eye level but well above the treetops. As it approached it appeared to get slightly brighter and larger, I had a clear view of it for approximately 2 minutes. Then suddenly the minimum color and the flashes of light disappeared. I realized that it was described to a fraction of its original appearance. I realized that it was descri
bed to a fraction of its original appearance. I slowed down to about 50 mph and watched the dark object for 2 to 3 minutes longer. Suddenly it was just above us - I stopped and looked out of the car window. The UFO was a brown luminous ob a huge fiery mass between two large dark bands - similar to a cigar shape. The 2 illuminators were slightly lost of the center as the craft appeared to be rotating. Then it appeared suddenly higher and seemed to melt away into the night sky. That's all I can recall. 
Hoping this report is helpful in your investigations.

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  10/7/67
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
On the evening of July 23, 1967, at approximately 6:44 p.m. I had been watching cloud formations to the west of my home when a bright orange object appeared in the sky. It was round in shape and slightly larger than a basketball when viewed at arm's length. It made no sound and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 500 ft. I watched the object for about 2 minutes as it moved in a straight line from southwest to northeast. It then appeared to increase in speed and altitude and disappeared from sight. There were no other witnesses to this sighting as far as I know. My wife was in the house at the time and did not see the object. The sky was clear and the sun was still above the horizon when I observed this occurrence. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and reflected the sunlight as it moved across the sky. I have had an interest in astronomy for many years and this was the first unidentified flying object I have ever observed.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO. The text below the sketch describes the object as having an "apparent diameter" of 50 feet, a "dull aluminum color", and "flashes of light". The text also mentions the "Appearances of UFO as observed - carefully" and contains additional details about the object's size and positioning.
