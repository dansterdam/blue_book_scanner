11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers sighted a light that when first observed appeared to be a helicopter. The object then proceeded in a straight line for a few seconds and then faded from view. The radar operator felt the object was no more than 3 to 4 minutes in duration. The high speed and irregular course of the object indicated to the observers it was a target moving 600-800 MPH due south.
COMMENTS: Radar operator felt he was painting automobile and not a UCR. Three different radar blips tracked rapidly. These pieces traveled approximately 35 seconds.

The object was dark in color, round in shape, and seemed to be hovering about 25 to 30 feet from the ground. It had a faint glow around the edge, and would occasionally dim and then brighten again. There was no sound that I could hear. It hovered for about 5 minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared within seconds. I could not see any wings or landing gear, and it did not resemble any aircraft I have ever seen before.

The objects were shiny and silver in color. They appeared to be about the size of a golf ball when held at arm's length. They moved slowly then seemed to make a sharp turn and went out of sight. It took about a minute from the time I first saw them until they disappeared. I could not determine if the objects were solid or transparent, but they seemed to be very bright and shiny. There was no sound associated with the sighting.

The objects were shaped like stars, but they were much larger and brighter than any stars I've ever seen. They seemed to move in a graceful, deliberate manner, and the change in direction was very noticeable. Somehow I got the impression that they were under intelligent control, but I can't say for certain. It was a strange experience and I'm still puzzled by what I saw.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

"21 Feb 1966

Talked to Lt. Mosley (SPAFRS)

On Oct 22 the decline of the platform decayed at 10572 5min. Lt. Mosley checked for visuals on the decay but only had one via. form Turkey and it took place at 09:42. 1. Lt. Marano, asked him if these things often break up during re-entry and if a piece could have come down about 20 min. after the predicted decay. He stated that the objects often do break up as they start to decay and that usually they only last the time of decay of the main piece. However the angle of inclination of the object was only 4.7 degrees.

UFO Observation, 21 October 1957

Dr. Charles F. Oliver
American Meteor Society

1. The aerial phenomenon (UFO) appears from Blytheville AFB, Arkansas, which occurred on 21 October 1957. The duration of the observation was thirty to forty-five seconds.

2. The observers sighted a bright white object to the south of the base. The object was described to be moving rapidly (direction not specified) and was described as being similar to a jet with afterburners. However, there were no scheduled aircraft in the area at the time and there were no targets on radar that could be correlated to the sighting.

3. Do your records indicate that any bright meteors passed over the southern United States at the approximate time of this sighting? If so, could it have been the cause for this sighting?

4. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

Flower and Cook Observatory 
Re: 1967 Heater Quinlan2illa, USAF
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Dear Major Quinlanilla:
Two letters from you March 18 and another one April 7 will all be answered in this letter.

First, with regard to your question: The University of Pennsylvania Observatory reports for 1967 OCT 22-28 and 1968 FEB 22-28 observations of an object designated as a Blimp. This object has been observed by other observatories as well. It appears to be a conventional blimp, most likely a commercial advertising blimp, which was sighted between 0516 and 0622 EST. I have so informed Dr. Hynek at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

The first observer at our Observatory did not recognize the object as a blimp, but through additional observations, particularly on February 22-28, we were able to establish conclusively that this was merely a conventional blimp. The fact that it was never reported from a point of vantage to and from the object made it difficult to establish a firm identity earlier. Neither the Arkansas reports nor data given these are pertinent. 

Secondly, a report by J. Hertenstein for 1968 FEB 25 20:22 GMT was in correct format and has been forwarded to the proper channels. His report will be included in the official file.

If you can get the reports of the sightings on 1967 OCT 22-28 and 1968 FEB 22-28, I would be very glad to get it, as then I might be able to complete the partial information I now have.

Sincerely yours,

1. THE AERIAL PHENOMENA OFFICE IS IN RECEIPT OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT FROM 13/16 MINUTES AFB, ARKANSAS WHICH OCCURRED ON 21 OCTOBER 1967, BETWEEN 0215 AND 0225 CDT. THE DURATION OF THE OBSERVATION WAS THIRTY TO FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.

2. THE OBSERVERS SIGHTED A BRIGHT WHITE OBJECT TO THE SOUTH OF THE BASE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION AND WHEN APPEARED TO BE TWO WHITE LIGHTS OBJECTS WITH RED EXHAUSTS. THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING SIMILAR TO JET AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER, THE RATE OF SPEED WAS MUCH GREATER THAN ANY JET AIRCRAFT KNOWN AT THAT TIME AND THERE WERE NO TARGETS ON RADAR THAT COULD BE CORRELATED TO THE VISUAL SIGHTING.

3. DID YOU RECEIVE ANY SIMILAR REPORTS FOR THIS DATE? WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AS TO A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THIS SIGHTING.

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

I am writing in reply to your letter of May 16th, and to enclose copies of pilot reports regarding this event.

If you will plot on a map, the positions of these three reports and show plane boundaries THIS of such aircraft involved, you will note that in each case, this aircraft could easily be three sightings of one and the same event.

There is a possibility that this was a large meteor decaying in our atmosphere breaking into two major components. If this is the case, then certainly the event was taking place far to the south of all four (yourselves/sighting included) reports.

These reports do not check out with any known satellites re-entries described at SDC in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Since your inquiry brought to our attention the fact that these were pilot reports, appear to be of some object or event, pointing out at the same time the plausibility of this being a meteor, I have asked a duplicate copy to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

If there is anything else I can help you with, be sure to write.

Sincerely Yours,

Alten I first saw the object of 08:05 p.m. the margin at about this time on the evening of 12:30 it was a bright object that most be a very high and could just be seen as a star. It appeared to move in a straight line across the sky from east to west and then it seemed to stand still for about 5 minutes. Then it began to move again in the same straight line. The object was visible for about 15 minutes. The color of the object was a reddish color and it gave off an unusual light that was different from that a star. We were operating like it was a drone and that we seen in the air about 3:30 and all the object as large steady. I believe I saw the same or a similar object about a half hour later.

TRANSCRIBED TEXT:

There were two bright - one slightly smaller of the other. My first thoughts were that they might have been airplanes -lights on the wings, lights on the tail. However, their behavior as they closed on us I could see the change.

They appeared to be circular craft travelling at a tremendous speed. They appeared to be under intelligent control. They seemed to close on our aircraft. We made an abrupt turn - the three headed straight for us and then under full power they shot away at an unbelievable speed. We were left startled and troubled as to what they were. We could not give chase as their acceleration was beyond our capability.

We discussed this phenomenon carefully amongst ourselves and felt we had encountered something quite out of the ordinary. More questions than answers came to our minds.

While first sighted it appeared as a brilliant object coming almost directly above us, without sensation as the become an angle between its course and our position we could see it was a very bright object. The 22nd of august at about 2215 hrs a bright light was observed. It appeared as a brilliant spherical object. Its first was striking. Seen for a long period with the naked eye. It was a bright tail seemed to diminish faster than the object itself. It took an elongated shape, then became less distinct, and the tail seemed to disappear. This phenomenon was of a comparatively long duration. It was observed about 2 minutes. It is thought this phenomenon may have been a meteorological occurrence or the re-entry of a satellite.

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 21 October 1967 at Blytheville AFB, Arkansas.

Your sighting was a bright object in the sky brighter than a star. The object entered the atmosphere and broke into several smaller pieces. These pieces traveled slowly toward the southwest and were visible for approximately fifteen seconds.

The meteor was also observed by the crew members of several different aircraft in the same area. This meteor has been observed previously and recorded in the Air Force records. However, there is not enough information to identify the exact nature of this phenomenon.
