Here is the text from the document:

(C) 30 THIN ISOTHBRMS  
(C) TEMPHRATURE GRADIENT  
HEIGHTS - THOUSANDS OF FEET  
10,000 - 1767  1.79 0/M  
20,000 - 12.5*C  2.230 C/M  
30,000 - 23.8*C  1.15* C/M  
40,000 - 46.39C  1.38* C/M  
50,000 - 60.3*C

* It seems that there were no activities such as balloon launehing in the area or meteorological activities in the area at the reported time. The object was traveling in the opposite direction.

** The boys who observed this object were very young and impressionable. However, they were quite positive as to the object's shape, size, and color. 

*** The object could not have been a balloon because its direction of motion was quite different from that of the winds. An airborne light could not have been seen as this object was. The boys stated that it was close enough for the object to be visible details,and there were no known aircraft in the vicinity which could have accounted for the appearance and behavior of the object as it was observed.

So in conclusion, the description of the object as given by the boys reminds one of the familiar sightings. The object seemed to have an artificial shell and bright lights, and gave the impression of a high speed controlled flight.
