9 June 1953
UNCLASSIFIED Tillamook, Oregon

Description
One unidentified object was reported by two USAF officers stationed with the 120th Fighter Interceptor Squadron detachment, Tillamook, Oregon. This object was seen at 1010 PST 9 June 1953. The object was viewed through 6 binoculars and appeared half-moon in shape and white in color. It appeared to hover and no manner of propulsion was observed. No manner of disappearance was reported.

Discussion
During such a long period of observation, any conventional object known to be on this earth could, under existing conditions, have moved from 120 deg at 25 knots. Project Blue Book's astronomers were contacted and they stated that this sighting was undoubtedly the planet Venus which, under ideal conditions, can be seen during the daylight hours.

Conclusion
Was astronomical (Venus).

Dear Lt. Olsson:
Of the last batch of 5 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is any question is the Detroit 11 June case. I can't wrap
this up and don't see how the analysis can be made until a film is
available of this so-called Detroit 11 June incident. Can you tell me
for us?
Regarding the Detroit 11 June case, there is nothing in this that
indicates a good landing sight would be confirmed. An an analysis
indicates that the object was reflecting from a probable clear weather
mirage, with faulty radar. I assume that the GGI had radar available.
And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and
unequivocally Venus.
Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up
questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.
Anything new on:
5 March
Shaw AFB
17 Feb.
Fort Austin -- film?
28 March
San Antonio
12 April
Stead AFB
I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's comments to see if any more business-like manner of handling these cases can be developed. I hope that through your successor measures can be appointed.
Cordially,
Allen Hynek

REFS: AFOIN-ATIAE-11-3

"Reference your FLYOBJCT RPT 09-9-52, ARIC requests answers to the following questions in order to determine the characteristics of the object from the observations:
1) What was the size and shape of the object?
2) How long was the object observed?
3) Were the altitude and elevation readings taken from the theodolite? a) Was the wind generally from the East? Give cloud cover- age and temperature and visibility conditions. 5) Could the moon have caused the sighting because of confusing weather conditions?"

It is imperative that Project Blue Book have the position of the object from the observers so they can be established whether or not it could have been a known source.

Reply by wire is requested. Cite Project Blue Book.
