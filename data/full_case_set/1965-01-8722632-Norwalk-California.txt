Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter in which you explained your sighting of an unidentified flying object which you could not identify. 

Your letter did not contain enough information for us to conduct a detailed investigation, and an examination of the object which you saw would be necessary before we could arrive at a definite conclusion concerning it.
