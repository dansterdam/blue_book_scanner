10. CONCLUSION: Unidentified
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer noted a mountain, light above and to the NW. The object appeared so that the object could be seen more clearly. The object remained motionless for about 30 seconds with a varying quite rapidly in color. After the initial sighting the object descended stopping for about half a minute, then descending again. During the descends neither the apparent size nor the color changed. Remaining very bright, it then quickly ascended out of sight in a northerly direction.

Sir:

Although I am perhaps a little behind in making this report, I feel that it may possibly be of some value.

First a little personal background -- I am 48 years old, in good physical health, eyesight is good, a trained pilot (Reserve officer not on active duty), not normally easily excited nor given to hallucinations.

On the night of 19 March 1966, I was returning from the Miami area to my home near New Smyrna Beach, Florida. I was driving north on highway U.S. 1 in my own auto, coastal road which were partially inundated by high tide to 100 feet or so, there had been slight scattered showers; traffic was light and at the time of the incident not far ahead of lights were visible either northor south of my position; there were no houses that I could see that were lighted from within; the time was approximately 001 hours, 20 March 1966. I had stopped just prior to this time at a restaurant in Mims, Florida, to have a cup of coffee and was approximately 2 to 4 miles north of Mims at the time of the sighting. I was travelling approximately sixty miles per hour and had the car window open. 

I noticed a pulsating light above and to my left front. I slowed the car, stopped and got out so as to see more clearly. The object remained motionless for a moment or so with the lights varying quite rapidly (80 to 100 alternations per minute) in color range of almost white to an intense blue. 

I estimated the altitude at between 5000 and 6000 feet. With my arm extended the object was covered by the tip of my index finger with the lights showing on the sides. I could not distinguish any details. The next step was indistinguishable, appearing only as a dark blob against the sky and stars.

After the initial sighting, the object descended several times in succession (4 or 5), each time lowering itself approximately 500 feet and stopping for a half minute or more, then descending again. During the descents neither the intensity nor the pulsation changed - remaining very constant.

At what appeared to be 1000 to 1500 feet above the area, the object hesitated for perhaps one and one-half minutes, then accelerated very rapidly in a northerly direction parallel to the highway and completely vanished in approximately 3 to 5 seconds.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scan of a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

Text output:

The whole episode covered perhaps 4 or 5 minutes. During this time no cars approached me from either direction nor did any pass me in either direction for perhaps 5 or more minutes after the incident.

I believe I have set forth all of the details that I remember. If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to ask. I am employed by NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

Very truly yours,
