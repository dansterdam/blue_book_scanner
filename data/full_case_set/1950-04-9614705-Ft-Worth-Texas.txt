Vet Sees Flying Objects in
Sky and Photographs Them

A Fort Worth man Monday said he saw flying objects in the sky near the Pacific, reported to be six or seven miles away, and took pictures of them.
Ira Maxey, of 916 5th Ave., a veteran radar bombardier, said he and his wife saw the objects in the sky about 6:30 p.m. Sunday in two groups, coming out of the west and traveling northeast. 
Maxey said he had his camera at the ready and happened to get some sort of aircraft, a type which he had never seen before.
The pictures showed that the objects appeared to be six or seven miles away, he said, and they were moving at a great speed, making a thunderous sound. After a few photographs the objects disappeared from view, Maxey stated.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Investigation of Alleged "Flying Saucers"

Location: Fort Worth, Texas
Date: 9 - 21 April 1950
Incident No.: CAP-2-79

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:
1. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Texas, published on 15 April 1950, a front page story and photographs on an alleged "Flying Saucer" sighting.

2. The report was investigated since it was the first known time that pictures had emerged and were considered to be "genuine" - the pictures have definite intelligence value.

3. An interview with Mr. J. Hickey, Director of Intelligence, was held and after evaluating the story and negatives, the following was established:

a. The photographs were taken on 16 April 1950 by an amateur photographer near the Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas. The photographs are considered genuine.

b. A study of the negatives by photo technicians at this headquarters indicates that the negatives have definite abnormalities or effects resulting from a physical origin. 

c. The report is being downgraded at a later date due to lack of significant intelligence value. This report is released in accordance with letter, Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, dated 10 January 1950, subject: Release of Project "Blue Book" Information.

APPROVED:

/s/ HAROLD T. MARTIN 
Lt Colonel, USAF
Director of Intelligence

(6) ". . . and there was the camera at infinity and beyond. . . ."
(6) A highly diffuse object was tracked to the horizon. The object first appeared to be at an infinite distance, then came closer. The camera was at the extreme limit of its range.
(7) "They definitely were not aircraft or anything like them here."
(7) The object moved up and down in an instantaneous manner, but made no sound and left no trail.
(2) " . . . they were OVERLY fast and they zipped away at very high speeds, not like anything we know about today . . ."
(2) The object appeared stationary at times, then accelerated at phenomenal speeds, far in excess of any known aircraft. It was observed for several minutes as it executed these maneuvers.
(3) " . . . it seemed to show that the objects had a power or intelligence controlling their flight. . . ."
(3) There was no noise or exhaust trail associated with the objects. This, together with their instantaneous acceleration and other observed characteristics, indicates they were under intelligent control.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
RCS: A-2-79
REPORT NO.: 
PAGE: 5 
DATE: 9 APRIL 1950
Director of Intelligence, Headquarters US Air Force
SUBJECT: Study in Interpretation of Negative and Photographic Information
1. One negative of the picture appearing in the past with the general outline obscured by white material. The material is not a masking, but is believed to be a normal condition of the development of this negative.
2. The positives resulting from the negative were fogged or blotched, which made detailed examination impossible.
3. Detailed technical analysis of the film itself could not be accomplished because the negatives were not available, but the effects described indicate that the film has physical characteristics attributable to normal photography operation and development. The film itself was not forwarded to the Intelligence Division of Headquarters US Air Force.
4. This film, when they received it, was attributed as strange occurrences to them.
5. Study in Interpretation of Negative and Photographic Information:
a. The negative characteristics revealed indicate that the positive prints submitted were probably the result of normal technical photographic difficulties rather than any abnormal or unusual photographic process.
b. The density and quality of the negative, as well as the nature of the fogging or blotching, reveal that the processing was not of the highest technical quality but nevertheless produced the positive prints submitted.
c. It is a thorough study of the negatives revealed that "You" could have been more leading than into the real or at least better development and printing that could possibly have substituted for good photographic techniques.
(1) The density of the film where it is completely clear or positive, leads one to believe it was a normal print and not abnormally dense.
(2) The second photograph (Fig. 1) reveals a similar density characteristic as the first, with some evidence of fogging on the edges, which is typical of normal processing difficulties.
6. Other Evidence:
a. Mr. claims to have seen the last object that could be seen.
b. Local radar installations report no unusual returns at that time.
c. Relative weather conditions at the time are not indicative of any unusual factors.
7. Evaluation of Findings:
The first North Star-Telegram" is from Fort Worth, Texas, and reveals that there is no evidence of any extravagant or unusual phenomena in the negatives submitted. All Air Force investigation and research by highly qualified personnel indicate that there is no evidence to support any claim of unusual celestial, aeronautical or physical occurrences. There are no indications of any sightings or events in the negatives.
