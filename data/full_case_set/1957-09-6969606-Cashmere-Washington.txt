The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed report from Project Blue Book regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The report describes the sighting of six unidentified objects that appeared to have the "appearance of an upside down light colored cone" and were traveling at a relatively low altitude. The objects were said to have appeared and disappeared in view, and were described as traveling very fast. The report also mentions that the investigating officer appeared to be dropped (possibly as a parachutist) from the objects.
