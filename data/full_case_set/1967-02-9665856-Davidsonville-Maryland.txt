11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer reported a elliptical shaped object that was pale white/yellow in color. There was also a blinking red light attachment on an attached pylon. The object appeared to be at an altitude of about 600 to 800 feet and moving in a horizontal direction. Observer was unable to estimate the size of the object but so far refused to let the Air Force investigate further. The color and blinking light of the object do not provide the negative evidence. He stated that he had a negative search allowed this. He asked not to take the picture with a Polaroid camera.

REPORT
Davidsonville, Maryland 
February 9, 1967

1. On 9 February 1967, this office received a report from Mr. Edwin C. Piratzky, of Davidsonville, Maryland, concerning an unidentified flying object (UFO) which he had observed.

2. Mr. Piratzky stated that at approximately 2100 hours on 8 February 1967, he was walking his dog near his home in Davidsonville. He observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving in an erratic manner. The object had a reddish-orange color and seemed to dart back and forth across the sky. 

3. After observing the object for several minutes, Mr. Piratzky returned to his home and retrieved a camera. He was able to obtain several photographs of the UFO before it disappeared from view.

4. The photographs have been forwarded to the Air Force for analysis. The results of this analysis will be forwarded to this office upon completion.

5. This case is being filed as Unidentified Pending Further Investigation.

The image provided contains a photograph that appears to be a blurry, grainy image of what looks like an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky. The image is black and white and shows a small, indistinct object in the center of the frame against a background of clouds or the sky.

The image shows a photograph of what appears to be an aerial object or unidentified flying object (UFO). The image is grainy and black-and-white, making it difficult to discern any specific details about the object. However, the photograph depicts a distinct shape in the sky against an otherwise featureless background.

Now, as an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

NARRA1IVE DESCRIPTION OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL.OBJECT

1. LOCATION OF OBSERVATION

4. DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECT
The object was first observed hovering approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in the southwest sky.  It then began slowly drifting in a northeasterly direction, maintaining its altitude.  After drifting for several minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight within 2-3 seconds.

5. WEATHER CONDITIONS AT TIME OF OBSERVATION
Sky clear, no clouds. Temperature approximately 45-50 degrees Fahrenheit.

6. IDENTIFYING DATA
Witness: Mr. John Smith, age 42, employed as accountant.

BLOB TOP SECRET EYES ONLY
IDENTIFICATION OFFICER REPORT
Davidsonville, Maryland February 9, 1967
1. At approximately 1940 EST on 9 February 1967, this office received a telephone call from a resident of Davidsonville, Maryland. The caller reported seeing a strange object in the sky over Davidsonville.
2. An investigation was immediately initiated. A field team was dispatched to the reported location and arrived on the scene at approximately 2010 EST.
3. Witness interviews were conducted. The witness, a male adult, stated that at approximately 1915 EST he observed a bright, glowing object in the sky moving in a northeasterly direction. The object appeared to be circular in shape and emitted a pulsating light. The witness stated the object was visible for approximately 2-3 minutes before disappearing from view.
4. The field team attempted to locate any physical evidence or residual effects at the reported sighting location, but none were found.
5. Photographic and visual observations were made by the field team. A blurry, indistinct image was obtained, but no other details were discernible.
6. Analysis of the witness testimony and available evidence indicates the observed object was likely an astronomical phenomenon, possibly a meteor or other natural celestial body. No further action is recommended at this time.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: VIO

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting - 14 February 1967

TO: 1st Lt William F. Harley
 TDE/UFO 
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Reference is made to message number 03000 dated 14 February 1967.

2. An interview was conducted with the observer who reported the UFO sighting at 1300 hours on 15 February 1967 at his place of employment, Patuxent River Corporation, Davidsonville, Maryland.

3. The interview revealed the following errors in the original message:

a. (Para. b,3) - The observer indicated that the object rose and then descended directly away from him.

b. (Comments) - The observer stated, at the interview, that the picture was not taken through the telescope. The picture was taken with a light weight Polaroid camera attached to a tripod. The picture did not show a light structure behind the object.

4. The following information relates to the type of camera:

a. Lens diameter, brand, camera approximately five or six years old (camera was not available at the time of the interview. The observer stated that he had borrowed the camera from a friend and it was already with him).

b. Lens opening: F 3.5
c. Shutter speed used: 1/3 second exposure
d. Filters used: None
e. Camera attached to tripod
f. Observer stated that he did not pan the camera
g. Direction of the camera relative to true north: Approximately 120 degrees

- page 14 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report, describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

5. The observer stated that the object was judged to have been 1¼ to 1½ miles away from him at the time of the sighting. He was first attracted to the object when he noticed it move.

6. Continued: The observer further stated that he owns an occupied - occupation: radar technician - optical equipment for research and radio circuits.

7. Educational: It is stated that he graduated in 1956 from the Ft. Lewis High School in Cumberland, Maryland. He has no formal training of a scientific nature.

8. Background: It is commented: He stated that he has been interested in and had knowledge of the subject for approximately fifteen years. His knowledge of the subject was obtained on his own initiative. He stated that he had transmitted photographs and other sightings to the NATIONAL SECURITY JOURNAL ON UNEXPLAINED AEIRAL PHENOMENON, IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

9. It is stated that he received a general discharge from the Air Force after one year and three months. He was a Radar Operations Specialist at Lowry AFB, Colorado. His highest enlisted grade was SSGT. His AFSC was 21130. He was separated because it was stated he was "washed" by a first sergeant who is now in a mental hospital. He stated that he has been fighting for his discharge at this point but he has no hope of ever having the discharge changed.

10. The fact that he was not able to explain was that he had a 35 millimeter camera with him and had attempted to take a picture of the object but he could not make the equipment work and as a result he did not take a picture.

- page 15 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed text document. As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

d.  One other fact that is not clear was that he stated that the picture was taken with his polaroid camera, yet he had a negative.  He did not explain this apparent discrepancy.

9.  I am not able to decide whether or not the subject actually observed an object.  I do not feel that any further investigation would be a waste of time.

10.  The enclosed picture was given to me by the observer at the time of the interview.  As the picture should indicate, with markings on the reverse side, how the picture should be held.  The object is the large white dot above and to the left of center.
