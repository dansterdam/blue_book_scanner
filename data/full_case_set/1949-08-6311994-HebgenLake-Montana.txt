15. No evidences of outward propulsion were evidenced by objects.
16. Object definitely had no fins, stabilizers or elevators.
17. Objects had no slots or duct openings.
18. Objects had a speed of about 1500 miles per hour. Informant
    was not able to accurately estimate this speed. Speed rating was
    obtained by finding the time the objects took to pass between known
    points.
19. Objects according to informant, sounded like a siren and the
    sound was continuous.
20. Six of the objects faded from view according to informant. Two
    of the objects crashed in the surrounding area. The possibility
    of fragments or other physical evidence was taken into consideration
    and a three day search was instituted, grappling hooks being
    employed for the object that was supposed to have crashed into
    the water.

RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER

1.
2.
3.
4.    West Yellowstone, Montana
      Hebgen Lake Lodge, West Yellowstone, Montana
      is employed by Mr. ****
      for the ********* *** and has been employed as a
      for approximately two months as of 9 august 1949. Mr. ****
                          duties entail that he also be in charge of the
      boat landing and dock area.

5. Observer's hobbies are his business, namely, hunting and fishing.
   Observer has had limited experience, little formal education
   and is virtually without qualification as pertains to aeronautical
   matters.

6. The observer should be a good judge as to the determination of
   color, size and speed of objects, however, after conversing with
   observer for a period of three days, it was felt that he is
   extremely prone to exaggerate, particularly as to the speed
   and number of things.

7. The employees of the Lodge seemed to agree that Mr. **** was
   a very reliable individual, regarding him as a sort of "Jewell"
   in the rough. They believed that because of his experience as
   a guide that he would be exceptionally well qualified to judge
   speed, color, size, and to be possessed of a quick and discerning
   eye. They stated that he knew nothing of 'flying discs' never
   having read about them at all. (This statement was open to
   doubt, inasmuch as an article about "flying discs" was in the
   boathouse where informant worked). It was agreed by all
   that the **** would be alo to take us directly to the
   objects. This he failed to do in almost three days of searching.
   A check with Deputy Sheriff of ****, West Yellowstone, indicated
   that Mr. **** had an excellent reputation, was considered an
   excellent **** and had a fair reputation for being truthful.

UNCLASSIFIED

Mr. ████████, employer of Mr. ████████, stated that he would unqualifiedly believe anything that the latter stated as being the truth. Mr. ████████ and Mr. ████████ have both known Mr. ████████ for a period of at least five years.

8. Informant states that his attention was brought to the object by the sound thereof; that it had a high, continuous sound analogous to a siren.

9. There were no other witnesses obtainable other than the observer. The observer reported that there had been a camper in the area who observed the same incident at the same and time and place. He had not obtained the camper's name and the camper had since moved on. No information could be obtained from the records of the ████████ relative to the name of the camper. The West Yellowstone area has a great number of similar tourists during this time of the year.

CONFIDENTIAL UNCLASSIFIED
HEADQUARTERS 2D ARMOIRED DIVISION
Camp Hood, Texas

16 August 1949

SUBJECT: Aerial Phenomena

TO : Commanding General
      Fourth Army
      Fort Sam Houston, Texas
      ATTN: AC of S, G-2

1. Enclosed is a consolidated report of unidentified aerial objects
observed by members of the Field Force between the hours of 2000 - 11 August
and 0100 - 12 August.

2. While the reports obtained from interviewing various members of
the Field Force, which differed in some details, there was general agreement
on the following:

      a. The unusual lights were initially observed in the north and
      moved in a southerly direction.
      
      b. Color of objects and trails was white.
      
      c. Distance from observer to light was unestimable.
      
      d. Period of observation from 3 to 5 seconds.
      
      e. Straight level flight of object.
      
      f. Moving light went out in a fraction of a second.
      
3. It is the considered opinion of the interviewer that the six (6)
reports of 10 August and the attached report of 11 August can be explained
as the natural phenomena of a shower of meteors from the vicinity of the
star Perseids which reaches its maximum display at this time.
      
      These reports of natural phenomena by army personnel who assume
they see unidentified aerial objects bears out the necessity, as previously
recommended, for assignment of qualified technical personnel with special
equipment to carry out the mission of observing and recording unidentified
aerial phenomena.

CHARACTER
SPECIAL INQUIRY - UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT

REFERENCE
None; this is an initial report.

SYNOPSIS
On 9 August 1949, this District Office was telephonically advised by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (Butte Office) of the purported sighting at 0930 A. M.,
that date, of eight (8) alleged "flying discs" in the Hebgen Lake, Yellowstone,
Montana, area. Mr. ███████ was contacted telephonically, and the essentials as previously
outlined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was confirmed by this office.
Further information was forthcoming that two of the "flying discs" had
crashed in the immediate surrounding area. On August 10, 11, 12, 1949,
investigation revealed that only one (1) individual actually saw the "flying
discs", Mr. ███████ The others employed as a "guide" by ███████ A pro-
longed search was instituted for the two discs that crashed in the immediate
area with negative results. Interrogation of the only witness revealed him
to be indefinite as to the physical characteristics of "objects" sighted.
Witness further declined to make any signed sworn statement regarding the
sighting of the discs. Inquiries revealed Mr. ███████ to have a
good reputation in all respects in the surrounding community. However, dis-
cussion with Mr. ████████ indicated to this AGENT that witness had a decided
tendency to exaggerate. Mr. ███████ was informed by this AGENT that if he
found either of the two "objects" which crashed, he was to immediately contact
the 15th OSI District (IG) USAF, Great Falls AFB, Montana.

UNC.LASSIFIE 
DETAILS:

1. On 9 AUGUST 1949, this office received a telephone call from a reliable federal agency concerning information pertaining to the alleged sighting of unconventional aircraft. This office conducted an interview of the individual, Mr. -------, who was alleged to have observed the object and made a search of the area where two (2) of the alleged discs are presumed to have fallen.

AT GREAT FALLS AIR FORCE BASE, GREAT FALLS, MONTANA

2. On 9 August 1949, this AGENT received a telephone call from Mr. LANGEN, Assistant Supervisor, Federal Bureau of Investigation District Office, Butte, Montana, to the effect that a Mr. -------, ----- lodge owner, on the Highway to Director, Montana, (just outside of West Yellowstone, Montana, had advised the Butte Office, FBI, that an employee of his, and a number of guests at the lodge, on the morning of 9 August 1949, sighted a flight of flying discs, two of which had landed in the immediate surrounding area. Seven of them were reputed to have come across the lake area at about 0930 hours, two of these failing in the immediate area, one in a wooded area on the opposite shore of the lake and one in the lake itself. Approximately one-half hour later another "flying disc" was observed to have flown across the Hebgen Lake area. 

3. On 9 August 1949, this AGENT contacted Mr. -------, who confirmed his telephone conversation with the Butte Office, FBI, and repeated essentially the same story that he had previously given to that agency. Mr. ------- further stated that one of the eyewitnesses, a guide employed by Mr. ------- new the approximate location of both of the "discs" that had fallen and would be held available to take any agents he might send to the objects. Mr. ------- stated that he believed that the eyewitness, a guide, knew to within a few hundred feet the specific location of the "discs". This AGENT questioned Mr. ------- closely, attempting to eliminate all possibilities such as jet aircraft, radio-sonde devices, pilot balloons, rawind devices, etc., with negative results. Mr. ------- further asserted that there were a number of people in the area who had observed this identical phenomenon.

AT HEBGEN LAKE, WEST YELLOWSTONE MONTANA

4. On 10 August 1949, this AGENT interviewed Mr. -------, ------- employed by the -------------------, relative to purported sightings made of a total of seven (7) flying discs at 0930 hours, 9 August 1949, and one (1) similar object. seen at about 1000 hours. Mr. ------- stated that two (2) of the objects had crashed in the surrounding area. Mr. ------- stated that

the objects were the approximate size and shape of an automobile tire, and at 
the time of sighting were not flying in formation. Mr. ****** stated that 
they were definitely not balloons, having the appearance of being constructed 
of metal and were grayish white. At the time of the sighting, Mr. ***** 
was standing on a boat siding at the edge of Hebgen Lake, the objects came 
across a ridge on the eastern shore of Hebgen Lake, just barely skimming the 
top of the ridge, (This ridge is approximately 1500 feet higher than the 
surrounding terrain) and were proceeding rapidly in a southwesterly direction. 
Two of the objects in the first flight crashed, the one which crashed in the 
lake threw up a large geyser of water, and the one which crashed in the woods 
on the opposite shore (a distance of two miles from the point at which 
was standing) raised a large cloud of dust as It hit into the woods. No fire, 
explosion or smoke of any kind accompanied the crashes. The remaining five 
objects disappeared rapidly from view across the ridges which are two mills 
from the western shore of Hebgen Lake. Mr. ***** could not estimate the speed 
of the objects, however, he stated that none of the objects were visible to 
him for more than five to ten seconds, and the objects that crashed were visible 
for about two (2) seconds. From maps of the general area this would place the 
speeds of the objects at approximately fourteen hundred miles per hour. Mr. 
****** stated that at the time of the appearance of the first seven objects, 
there was no one in his immediate vicinity who actually saw them. Then the 
next one appeared, one-half hour later, he attempted to call the attention of 
his assistant to them; however, it had disappeared before the Assistant could 
view it. Mr. ******* further stated that he had not intended to make an 
official report of the sightings, but that when he told his employer, ****** 
of ******, Mr. ***** took it upon himself to call the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation relative to the matter. 

5. An attempt was made by this AGENT to contact other witnesses of the 
same phenomena as reported by Mr. *****. In this respect all employees 
and guests of the ****** were interviewed with negative results. It 
was learned that there was possibly one additional witness, a camper who had 
camped on the shore of the lake overnight and had since moved on. In addition 
to the employees and guests of the Lodge, attempts were made to find witnesses 
among residents in the immediate area, residents in the town of West Yellowstone 
(17 miles away) and from the U. S. Ranger Station, West Yellowstone, Montana. 
No witnesses were able to be obtained. 

 AGENT'S NOTE: There seemed to exist an apparent attempt by a number of individuals 
to convince this AGENT that the ****** was absolutely reliable, trustworthy 
and beyond question, that if he said this incident occurred, it did. The 
statement was made by the ******, Mr. ****, that if anything was found, 
the *****might become a "mecca" for tourists, and it was this AGENT'S impression 
that whether anything was found or not, Mr. ***** would have welcomed the
attendant publicity. Frequent conversations with the ***** Mr. ******** 
clearly indicated that he had a decided tendency to exaggerate, and that 
his conversation was often made up of grossly exaggerated stories.

6. On 11 August and 12 August 1949, this AGENT and Special Agent
ROBERT P. SPALDING searched the wooded area in which one of the discs was
reported to have crashed. Nothing even remotely resembling the object
debris was found. There was no evidence in the wooded area that any
object had crashed through the trees, nor was there any indication of
earth displacement. The wooded area was carefully scanned for swath patches
that an object travelling at high speed would necessarily make. Also the
area was searched for indications of charred or scorched areas. On 13 August
1949, this AGENT and Special Agent ROBERT P. SPALDING dragged Hebgen Lake
in the vicinity indicated by Mr. - with negative results.

7. The following information is in answer to requirements set forth in
Part II, Air Intelligence Requirement, Memorandum No. 4, dated 15 February 1949.

I. August 9, 1949
II. 0930 hours, Mountain Standard Time
III. 44 degrees 49 minutes North Latitude
          111 degrees 15 minutes West Longitude
IV. Eight "flying discs", seven in the first flight and one
          reported one-half hour later. Only observer reported
          definite formation.
V. Local facilities and organizations which fallor celestial
          phenomena reported that no celestial phenomena were observed in
          the 'West Yellowstone, Montana, area on 9 August 1949.
VI. Objects in relation to observer passed directly overhead at an
          altitude of approximately 1500 feet above the ground, six of
          the objects continued flight in a southwesterly direction at the
          same altitude. Two of the objects were observed by the informant
          to crash in the immediate area; however, no fire, explosion or
          smoke of any kind resulted from the crash.
VII. It is believed that the six (6) objects which were in flight were
          in sight a total of ten seconds, however, the two which crashed
          were not in sight more than two seconds according to informant.
VIII. A. Object was a grayish metallic color.
              B. The shape of all objects would most nearly correspond to the
          shape and size of an automobile tire. Informant stated that
          some of them had a blackish spot in the middle.
              C. The objects were apparently constructed of metal.
              D. The size of the objects from the observer's view was the
          approximate size of an automobile tire.
IX. The objects were flying in a southwesterly direction.
X. The flights were reported to be in a horizontal plane and
          objects appeared to be moving at an even flow.
XI. There was no evidence of exhaust, neither was there any odor
          and objects left no contrails.
XII. Objects while observed by informant did not pass through clouds.
XIII. No lights were observed to be attached to object.
XIV. In questioning informant, he stated that he could not note
          an observe any means of support the objects would have such as
          wings, vertical jet, rotating cylinder or cone; aerosotatic lift
          or aerodynamic list of fuselage.

REFERENCE None; this is an initial report.

SYNOPSIS 
On 9 August 1949, this District Office was telephonically advised by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (Butte Office) of the purported sighting at 0930 A.M., that date, of eight (8) alleged "flying discs" in the Hebgen Lake, Yellowstone, Montana, area. Mr. ---------------
the informant, was contacted telephonically and the essentials as previously outlined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was confirmed by this office. Further information was forthcoming that two of the "flying discs" had crashed in the immediate surrounding area. On August 10, 11, 12, 1949, investigation revealed that only one (1) individual actually saw the "flying discs", Mr. ---------------- employed as a "guide" by --------------. A pro-longed search was instituted for the two discs that crashed in the immediate area with negative results. Interrogation of the only witness revealed him to be indefinite as to the physical characteristics of "objects" sighted, witness further declined to make any signed sworn statement regarding the sighting of the discs. Inquiries revealed Mr. -------------- to have a good reputation in all respects in the surrounding community. However, discussion with Mr. -------------- indicated to this AGENT that witness had a decided tendency to exaggerate. Mr. -------------- was informed by this AGENT that if he found either of the tro "objects" which crashed, he was to immediately contact the 15th OSI District (IG) USAF, Great Falls AFB, Montana.

DETAILS:

1. On 9 August 1949, this office received a telephone call from a 
reliable federal agency concerning information pertaining to the alleged 
sighting of unconventional aircraft. This office conducted an interview 
of the individual, Mr. -----, who was alleged to have observed 
the object and made a search of the area where two (2) of the alleged 
discs are presumed to have fallen.

AT GREAT FALLS AIR FORCE BASE, GREAT FALLS, MONTANA

2. On 9 August 1949, this AGENT received a telephone call from Mr.
LANGEN, Assistant Supervisor, Federal Bureau of Investigation District 
Office, Butte, Montana, to the effect that a Mr. -----, ----- -----, 
of -----, Butte, Montana, ---- Yellowston, Montana, had advised the Butte 
Office. FBl, that an employe of his, and a number of guests at the Lodge 
had, on the morning of 9 August 1949, sighted a flight of flying discs, 
two of which had landed in the immediate surrounding area. Seven of them 
were reputed to have come across the Lake area at about 0930 hours, two 
of these failing in the immediate area, one in a wooded area on the opposite 
shore of the Lake and one in the Lake itself. Approximately one-half hour 
later another "flying disc" was observed to have flown across the Hebgen Lake 
area.

3. On 9 August 1949, this AGENT contacted Mr. -----, ----- 
----------- -----, West Yellowstone, Montana, by telephone. Mr. ----- 
confirmed his telephone conversation with the Butte Office, FBI, and repeated 
essentially the same story that he had previously given to that agency. Mr. 
----- further stated that one of the eyewitnesses, a guide employed by Mr. 
----- knew the approximate location of both of the "discs" that had 
fallen and would be held available to take any agents he might send to the 
objects. Mr. ----- stated that he believed that the eyewitness, a guide, 
knew to within a few hundred feet the specific location of the "discs". 
This AGENT questioned Mr. ----- closely, attempting to eliminate all pos- 
sibilities such as jet aircraft, radio-sonde devices, pilot balloons, rawin 
devices, etc., with negative results. Mr. ----- further asserted that 
there were a number of people in the area who had observed this identical 
phenomenon.

AT HEBGEN LAKE, WEST YELLOWSTONE, MONTANA

4. On 10 August 1949, this AGENT interviewed Mr. -----, ----- 
employed by the ----- relative to purported sightings made of 
a total of seven (7) flying discs at 0930 hours, 9 August 1949, and one (1) 
similar object . seen at about 1000 hours. Mr. ----- stated that two (2) 
of the objects had crashed in the surrounding area. Mr. ----- stated that

the objects were the approximate size and shape of an automobile tire, and at
the time of sighting were not flying in formation. Mr. ███████ stated that
they were definitely not balloons, having the appearance of being constructed
of metal and were grayish white. At the time of the sighting, Mr. ███████ 
was standing on a boat siding at the edge of Hebgen Lake, the objects came
across a ridge on the eastern shore of Hebgen Lake, just barely skimming the
top of the ridge, (This ridge is approximately 1500 feet higher than the
surrounding terrain) and were proceeding rapidly in a southwesterly direction.
Two of the objects in the first flight crashed, the one which crashed in the woods
lake threw up a large geyser of water, and the one which crashed in the woods
on the opposite shore (a distance of two miles from the point at which the
was standing) raised a large cloud of dust as it hit into the woods. No fire,
explosion or smoke of any kind accompanied the crashes. The remaining five
objects disappeared rapidly from view across the ridges which are two miles
from the western shore of Hebgen Lake. Mr. ███████ could not estimate the speed
of the objects, however, he stated that none of the objects were visible to
him for more than five to ten seconds, and the objects that crashed were visible
for about two (2) seconds. From maps of the general area this would place the
speeds of the objects at approximately fourteen hundred miles per hour. Mr.
████████ stated that at the time of the appearance of the first seven objects,
there was no one in his immediate vicinity who actually saw them. Then the
next one appeared, one-half hour later, he attempted to call the attention of
his assistant to them; however, it had disappeared before the Assistant could
view it. Mr. ███████ further stated that he had not intended to make an
official report of the sightings, but that when he told his employer, Mr.
███████, Mr. ███████ took it upon himself to call the Federal Bureau of
Investigation relative to the matter.

5. An attempt was made by this AGENT to contact other witnesses of the
same phenomena as reported by Mr. ███████. In this respect all employees
and guests of the █████████████ were interviewed with negative results. It
was learned that there was possibly one additional witness, a camper who had
camped on the shore of the lake overnight and had since moved on. In addition
to the employees and guests of the Lodge, attempts were made to find witnesses
among residents in the immediate area, residents in the town of West Yellowstone
(17 miles away) and from the U. S. Ranger Station, West Yellowstone, Montana.
No witnesses were able to be obtained.

AGENT'S NOTE: There seemed to exist an apparent attempt by a number of individuals
to convince this AGENT that the ███████ was absolutely reliable, trustworthy
and beyond question, that if he said this incident occurred, it did. The
statement was made by the █████████, Mr. ███████ that if anything was found,
the ███████ might become a "mecca" for tourists, and it was this AGENT's impression
that whether anything was found or not, Mr. ███████ would have welcomed the
attendant publicity. Frequent conversations with the ███████, Mr. ███████
clearly indicated that he had a decided tendency to exaggerate, and that
his conversation was often made up of grossly exaggerated stories.

6. On 11 August and 12 August 1949, this AGENt and Special Agent
ROBERT P. SPALDING searched the wooded area in which one of the discs was
reported to have crashed. Nothing even remotely resembling the object
debris was found. There was no evidence in the wooded area that any
object had crashed through the trees, nor was there any indication of arty
earth displacenrent. The wooded area was carefully scanned for swath patches
that an object travelling at high speed would necessarily make. Also the
area was searched for indications of charred or scorched areas. On 13 August
1949, this AGENT and Special Agent ROBERT P. SPALDING dragged Hebgan Lake
in the vicinity indicated by Mr. with negative results.

7. The following information is in answer to requirements set forth in
Part II, Air Intelligence Requirement, Memorandum No. 4, dated 15 February 1949.

    i. August 9, 1949
    2. 0930 hours, Mountain Standard Time
    3. 111 degrees 49 minutes North Latitude
       111 degrees 15 minutes West Longitude
    4. Eight "flying discs", seven in the first flight and one
       reported one-half hour later. Only observer reported no
       definite formation.
    5. Local facilities and organizations which follow celestial
       objects reported that no celestial phenomena were observed in
       the West Yellowstone, Montana, area on 9 August 1949.
    6. Objects in relation to observer passed directly overhead at an
       altitude of approximately 1500 feet above the ground. Six of
       the objects continued flight in a southwesterly direction at the
       same altitude. Two of the objects were observed by the informant
       to crash in the immediate area; however, no fire, explosion or
       smoke of any kind resulted from the crash.
    7. It is believed that the six (6) objects which were in flight were
       in sight a total of ten seconds, however, the two which crashed
       were not in sight more than two seconds according to informant.
