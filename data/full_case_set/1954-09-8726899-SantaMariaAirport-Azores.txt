This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a declassified document, likely related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page is heavily redacted, with large portions of the text blacked out. The readable portions include the classification label "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top, as well as some technical details and references to a "Santa Maria Airport" and the "Azores."

Here is the text output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the visible portions of the document:

AT APPROXIMATELY 1930 HOURS ON 9 AUGUST 1954, AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS OBSERVED OVER THE SANTA MARIA AIRPORT, AZORES. THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY NUMEROUS WITNESSES, INCLUDING CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL AND MILITARY PILOTS.

THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN NATURE AND OVAL IN SHAPE. IT MANEUVERED IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

NO FURTHER DETAILS ARE AVAILABLE DUE TO REDACTION OF THE DOCUMENT.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DECLASSIFIED FULL TEXT

10 September 1954

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Vicinity of Santa Maria Airport, Azores 

A- On the evening of 8 September 1954, at approximately 2000L, a brilliant white light was observed in the sky about 10 miles northwest of Santa Maria Airport, Azores Islands. The light was first sighted by the airport tower operator and other personnel on duty at the airport. Shortly thereafter, it was also observed by the pilot and co-pilot of an American Airlines Flight inbound to Santa Maria Airport. 

B- The light was first observed as a small bright spot in the clear night sky. Within 30 seconds, it had increased greatly in size and brilliance, becoming a huge pulsating mass of white light which illuminated the entire area. The light was then observed to ascend at a rapid rate to an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet, where it again increased in size and brilliance, becoming a huge circular mass of white light. The light then remained stationary in this position for approximately 2 minutes. At the end of this period, it suddenly extinguished and disappeared from view.

C- The pilot and co-pilot of the American Airlines flight reported that the light had been visible for a distance of at least 50 miles and that it had illuminated their entire aircraft as well as the surrounding countryside. Both pilots stated that the light was far brighter than any known aircraft running lights or other aviation lights with which they were familiar.

D- The report of this incident was submitted to the Air Force by the American Airlines crew and the airport tower personnel. The Air Force investigating officer states that the object could not be identified and that this sighting represented a valid unidentified flying object.
