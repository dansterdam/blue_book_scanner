k. This particular report was called in to the O'Hare Base Operations Office. The young lady seemed cooperative. She felt that someone might need to know about the object she was sighting. She was allegedly writing a letter to the Air Force about the information described in AFR 200-2. It is this officer's opinion that the sighting was either a helicopter or aircraft. Approximately where the North Avenue beach is located is also point where several aircraft were observed. The item system 27 at O'Hare would run this type of lights well out over the lake to distinguish their aircraft because of the heavy traffic. It appears to combine the bright landing lights with a revolving motion beacon to explain the touch or red. The landing lights from a distance appear to twinkle because of their candle power and distance. This is original or report written by the observer.

July 16, 1965

Dear Sir:

This report is in regards to an incident that occurred on July 11, 1965, at approximately 11:45 p.m. in Chicago, Illinois. While driving home, I observed a bright light in the sky that seemed to be moving rapidly. The light appeared to be a solid object, and it was traveling at a high rate of speed. The object made no sound and appeared to be silvery in color. It was visible for approximately 30 seconds before it suddenly disappeared. I am unsure of the exact size or altitude of the object, but it was significantly larger than any conventional aircraft I have seen in the area. I am reporting this incident as I believe it may be of interest to your project. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Now acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

Wh y this sho uld have attracted a ttention in the first place is not at all clear. The object was sighted at about 8:15 pm on 7 July 1965 by an unidentified witness in Chicago, Illinois. There is no evidence presented to indicate that the object was anything other than a conventional aircraft. The report form does not indicate any unusual characteristics of the object, such as speed, altitude, or maneuvers, that would suggest an unconventional aircraft. In the absence of more substantive evidence, there is no reason to conclude that this sighting represents an unidentified flying object.

ON THE CORNER OF W. RIDGE AND W. PETERSON ARE THERE IS A BUILDING WHICH SOME FOLK CALL THEMSELVES FROM BUILDING OUT IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE WITH SEVERAL NEIGHBORS. IT WAS a SIGHT WHICH WAS VERY BRIGHT WHICH LOOKED LIKE A LIGHTED CIRCULAR OBJECT IN THE SKY WHICH SEEMED TO WATCH OVER OUR HOUSE VERY INTENSELY. HE SAID THEIR WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY AND HE THINKS POSSIBLY IT COULD HAVE BEEN A HELICOPTER AS THEY SAW IT AS a SINGLE OBJECT HOVERED OVER THE BUILDING AND THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WHAT WE BOTH SAW AND SAY ANY DAMAGE MAY HAVE BEEN THIS.

Dear Mr. E. J. Ruppelt:
This is in reply to your report of aerial objects which you could not identify on 25 and 26 July 1965.
Your sightings have been evaluated as probable observations of stars, satellites, or meteors, rather than unidentified aerial phenomena. The reported observations do not appear to be of anything out of the ordinary and are likely explainable as light phenomena due to atmospheric conditions, such as weather conditions or temperature inversions.
The report from Cannon Air Force Base on 23 March 1957 was an investigation of radar and visual observations. This information was released by the Air Force to the press. The phenomena Air Force fighter Center found no connection with the observations.
We have no reports from Clovis, New Mexico, on 2 or 3 November 1957.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Over Chicago, Illinois
on 29 July 1965
An unidentified flying object was observed over Chicago, Illinois on the nights of July 28 and 29, 1965. The object, having a bright yellowish light, apparently moving at a high rate of speed, was observed by many residents in the Chicago metropolitan area. The object seemed to be moving from north to south over Chicago. The observing conditions were good with a clear sky.

The object was observed by one of my friends who stated that it appeared to be slightly smaller than the moon and was moving at a very high rate of speed. He said the object disappeared from view shortly after it was first observed. Another friend of mine, an airman who is stationed at an air base near Chicago, also observed the object and described it as a bright yellowish light, apparently moving at a high rate of speed from north to south over the city. He further stated that the object was visible for only a few seconds before disappearing from view.

There have been many reports of similar unidentified flying objects being observed over the Chicago metropolitan area during the past several years. These objects have been described by observers as being circular in shape, metallic in appearance, and emitting a bright yellowish light. Most of the observers have stated that the objects appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed.

The U.S. Air Force is investigating this latest report and will furnish additional information when it becomes available.

An investigation of our observational capabilities of this unit case.

At 8:20 a.m. C.S.T. on July 24, 1965, this station received a report from a civilian source that three luminous round objects the shape of pilots' helmets, "bright green in color," were seen over the Chicago area from the angle of elevation of 35-40 degrees and above stagnant, motionless for approximately 5 minutes. The objects were "about 6-8 inches in diameter and approximately 1000 feet above the surface."

The report mentioning took place three days later and was conducted as follows:

At 9:35 p.m. C.D.S.T., the writer of this report, in company with two other civilian observers, observed the same three bright green luminous round objects through telescopic lenses, approximately 800 to 1000 feet above the surface and at an elevation of 45-50 degrees. The objects appeared to be "sharp clear, about 6-8 inches in diameter, and made no sound whatsoever." The objects remained stationary for 30 minutes, then accelerated and disappeared from view.

This report is an attempt to scientifically evaluate this sighting and to determine if it represented an unidentified aerial phenomenon. All described characteristics point to an unusual celestial event in the sky over Chicago on that date. The described brightnesses, shapes, motions, and other parameters are consistent with a fairly common atmospheric optical phenomenon known as "mock suns" or "sun dogs." These are caused by the refraction of sunlight through ice crystals in cirrus clouds at high altitudes and are often observed during certain weather conditions. In this case, the temperature and humidity levels were conducive to the formation of such an effect.

2. The analysis section has evaluated the objects which he and visual observers have described. The analysis indicates that these objects were visible to the naked eye. Frequently the path of these objects appear to be erratic with changes in speed and direction. This is caused by an illusion as the light passes near another or by atmospheric conditions such as smoke or inversion.

3. The report from Cannon AFB on 23 March 1957 was investigated by local authorities. The vehicles observed were star-like and conventional lights on a nearby barn. This information has been consolidated to be file for the present. The Hindence Air Filter Center had no connection with the observation.

TEXT FOUND IN THE DOCUMENT:

Department of the U.S.A.F.
Provisional Officer,U.S.F.O.
Washington 25, D.C.

Sir:
I would like to report some very peculiar aerial behavior which I observed on July 29, 1965.
At approximately 11:45 p.m. Central Daylight Time, my wife and I were outdoors observing the stars, as usual. We noticed a very bright object flying from north to south over Chicago. The observing conditions were excellent and the object stood out clearly against the sky.
At first I thought it might be a very high flying aircraft, but the speed and absence of the usual aircraft running lights indicated otherwise. We watched it for about 4 or 5 minutes as it slowly made its way to the south. Then, suddenly, it stopped dead in its tracks and hovered for a few seconds. Next, it began to oscillate back and forth, then dart rapidly in various directions, sometimes disappearing and reappearing. It seemed to be under intelligent control. The maneuvers were unnatural for any known aircraft. Finally, it accelerated at a fantastic rate of speed and disappeared from sight to the south.
These were the observations: a bright, motionless object travelling from north to south, then sudden stops, oscillation, rapid changes of direction, very fast acceleration and disappearance. The luminosity of the object was exceptionally bright, without blinking or flashing lights.
As you can imagine, this was a most unusual sighting and we could offer no explanation as to the nature of the object. I would appreciate any information you can provide as to what it might have been. Thank you.

Sincerely,

- page 26 -

As to the question of our observations' credibility, I submit these facts:
1. For the past 16 years, we have known, seen, and photographed, unmistakably, unidentified aerial objects which we call "flying saucers."
2. The so-called flying saucers have been observed and reported by military and naval personnel, aeronautical engineers, pilots and astronomers, and many other reliable observers.
3. These objects have been observed in day and night hours, under excellent visual conditions, and have been tracked by radar.
4. We have seen airplanes and helicopters at night. This object was neither. 
The second sighting took place three days later and was confirmed by six others.
At 9:45 p.m. C.D.S.T., the six of us saw an unusually bright, fast-moving object in the south-southwest. It would travel at a terrific speed and then hover motionless. It would then suddenly dart off at a tremendous speed.
We were fortunate enough to see this object through our binoculars. A paper enclosed. The still photograph was actually observed with an Airview camera for about four or five minutes.
This, in my opinion, is good evidence as to whether this was a natural phenomenon or an artificial device under intelligent control. In the latter case, it would be a violation of the so-called Air Force regulation that prohibits members of the Air Force from making any statements on this subject, or it could be an inadvertent oversight on their part.
The other three members of the party are also very capable observers, and could observe and describe this phenomenon better than I. 
This is over 15 years of sightings. He has seen all the objects as described in the sighting. He states that in his opinion, what he saw was not doing anything that could be considered dangerous or alarming - there was no other activity around the sight, and no attempts to approach or interfere with the object. He either did not report it or was told not to let it go beyond the group.
I would now like to show the differences between what I have observed and the difference between this and an Unusual brightness. They both showed. Characteristic maneuvers were reported. There is to be an understandable explanation, I would like to know what it is. The illumination was quite bright enough to disturb the night vision. It would hover, then dart off at incredible speed, leaving a trail, then stop and hover again. This went on for a while. Clear visibility over the entire sighting.

COMMENTS: Mrs. Hank McGonn during phone interview seemed to be reliable until further probing found that her observation of something sighted in the air force and seemed to feel he was an authority on contraits, aircraft shapes, etc. Further probing found that she observed someone signaling by light in some code (SOS) to the object. It is to be noted that this observation was made on July 5th, a legal holiday with many fireworks displays throughout the city. Also the witness White box were playing a night game. At most of the night games fireworks are set off, this reporter could not establish the fighting is detectable because of the sound of the reports. The witness has failed to do so to this date.
