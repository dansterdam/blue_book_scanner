high rate of speed appeared to be traveling in a very narrow path which was illuminated just for a few seconds.
A visual for only a few seconds was all
that was seen of the satellite which was
observed at around 9:20 P.M. on the evening of November 8, 1960.
The observer reported that the satellite
appeared to be illuminated and moving
at a very high rate of speed in a very
narrow path across the sky.
It is stated that the satellite was observed
at Tyndall AFB, Fla. and New Orleans,

The observer reported that the satellite
appeared to be out of the range of ordinary aircraft and that it was moving at a
rate of speed far in excess of any known
aircraft."
